He told me about his poly leanings upfront, but we agreed to be monogamous, at least while I tried to wrap my head around it.

I think she felt like we were the perfect couple, and because she lives alone and was quite lonely, she wanted to share in our happiness as much as possible. This was challenging for me because we were basically putting on a front for her, when actually things were secretly pretty strained.\n\nDuring our relationship I had taken on a lot of the emotional labor with his mom. Organising dinners, and filling in the communication gaps because he was in the grips of what I later realized was high functioning alcoholism.\n\nWhen we split I kind of snapped and was like, \u201cI\u2019m done with being the caretaker for everyone, I\u2019m not going to be the one to tell her or manage her feelings about it\u201d. I was also angry and upset at the time because he almost immediately rekindled a relationship with his ex, and I had a bit of a fu attitude about everything. I was in a bad place myself and needed time and space heal without feeling like I had to take care of his moms feelings and her inevitable shock.\n\nI also felt like if she asked me anything, I might just unleash my whole 3 years of woes, which really would not be good.\n\nI stayed at home on the holidays and didn\u2019t call her to explain or reach out in anyway. This is where I may be TA. \n\nI expected my husband to tell her, but he didn\u2019t until about a year later, when I moved out to live with my new partner in another state. \n\nI didn\u2019t cheat on my husband, but I moved on very quickly as well, because honestly I just wanted to be happy, and was probably on the rebound a bit. \n\nI messaged his mom when I left but she didn\u2019t reply, and so at this point I haven\u2019t spoken to her in about 2 years.\n\nI feel terrible about it because I know from her point of view it looks like I dumped him and moved on without saying anything to her.

You messaged her and she didn't respond.  The ball remains in her court.\n\nYou might feel bad because you took on some emotional caretaking for a person, and you might feel some responsibility for abandoning her, or making her feel as if you didn't care.  This might be tied to why you did it in the first place rather than letting your ex take the lead on managing the relationship with his own parent.  But you did message her. And she did not respond.  \n\nSo why is it that you want to \"smooth things over with her\"?  Even if you don't want to throw your ex under the bus, is there a part of you that wants her to know the facts and vindicate your actions?  Or something else?  \n\nIf she called tomorrow and said she would love to reconnect, but insisted on never talking about your ex or that relationship or the breakup (etc.), would you be relieved, or feel unsatisfied, like that would be missing the point?  Or something else?  Is there another reason why you want to reconnect?", "NTA - you did reach out when you left and she didn't reply.  \n\n\nYWNBTA for telling her why.", "NTA. You had your reasons for not reaching out.", "Lord...just good Lord....  \n\nSo you faked a good relationship for his mom's benefit.  Then y'all break up but it sounds like you still lived together for a year?  Did you not talk to his mom at any point in that year?  You ghost her?  Keep planning things with her?  Then you move out and your ex still doesn't say anything to her.   \n\nWhy do you need to smooth things over with her?  You want her to know it's not her, it's him?   Because you want her to be on your side of things?  I just don't understand.   You moved on, so move on.   \n\nESH except the MIL", "NTA and honestly just block her and move on with YOUR life.  \n\nHe has already spun the narrative in his favor and nothing you will say will really matter long run.   Unless you really cared about this woman and were great friend then my view is to just not say anything.  Guilt sux but you shouldnt feel guilty for getting out of the relationship and not talking to her.

Me an my ex are on really good terms now and I\u2019m going to visit him soon, so I guess I felt like I should reach out to her and clear the air. It feels weird having a relationship with him and not her. \n\nYou\u2019ve made me realise though, that I also probably do want to feel vindicated, which makes me think I\u2019m better off leaving it.\n\nShe didn\u2019t reply to my messages, and it would be an AH move for me to force a meeting with her just to \u2018clear my name\u2019. Thank you, you\u2019re questions have given me better clarity.", "Thank you. I didn\u2019t reach out to her to make plans for the holidays, which I would normally do. And I think that must have upset her because she didn\u2019t message me either. Then when I messaged her several month later she didn\u2019t reply. I can see why I may be TA for that. \n\nThank you for your questions they gave me clarity. I care about her and I guess I also don\u2019t want her to see me as a bad person. I feel bad that things ended so awkwardly between us with no explanation. But you\u2019re right, I probably do want to tell her my side of the story and that\u2019s an AH move. I should just leave it be and not drag it all up to try and make myself feel better or control the narrative.", "^this. Good job. She didn\u2019t reply, it\u2019s old news now. There\u2019s no point bringing it up, and if SHE does then her son can deal with it.", "But do you really need to do this? I mean, if you want to keep her as a friend, then yes, maybe that makes sense, but any MIL with any intuition would work out that this must have been a very difficult time for you, and that there are often things going on within a relationship that stay hidden and aren't visible even to close family members. \n\nI wonder if you're giving yourself a hard time over this for no reason. Maybe something for a therapist first, before you contact your ex-MIL?", "NTA but move on. You messaged her, she didn't reply. Let it go already.", "This feels like a very mature response on your part, OP.", "You are assuming a lot about her thoughts and feelings. You don\u2019t know any of that so you should stop feeling guilty for imaginary feelings of someone else", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and didn\u2019t call her to explain or reach out in anyway\" .. She did not reach out to you, either.- So: not a big thing. You are fine.", "YTA. You already treated her badly because of your failed relationship with the husband, again husband that you chose even though he said he wasn\u2019t monogamous. \n\nLeave the poor woman alone. It\u2019s your guilt of being a shitty person that has got you wanting to reach out to her. She needs nothing from you nor does she want anything from you. Leave her alone.", "It's understandable that you would want a small win after a nasty breakup. I had an ex who was polyamorous while I'm monogamous. After seven months of being monogamous my ex decided he wanted our relationship to become polyamorous. I tried to understand his views but watching him with other girls crushed me emotionally. It felt like he is cheating right in front of me and I was watching myself get replaced. Which is exactly what my ex did. From the beginning I repeatly came crying to my ex because of how lonely and replaced I felt. He would just make empty promises and push this view of all of us eventually becoming a happy family in the end. All while he put in no effort into changing the situation. At nine months I broke up with him and moved my stuff out of his apartment. When I was moving out his new girlfriend of three months was moving in because she couldn't use her ex for housing anymore. This new girlfriend was his stupid ex who he has already treated horribly years ago by stopping all communication with her for years because he got a new girlfriend and she didn't like her. I'm super petty OP. I talked to his mother right after I broke up with him. I said she and her husband were wonderful people and I always appreciated that they treated me like family. I will miss them but I hope they keep up their tradition of smack talking the girlfriends they hate for their son. They already don't like the ex that is his new girlfriend. Then told her I will never be able to under how such a terrible man came from such a loving family. Then I told her about all the horrible ways he treats women. I not only felt terrible from the break up but the whole situation just seemed so unjust. I was so hurt and he lost nothing. So I got the satisfaction of knowing his mother will always be disappointed in how he treats women. I don't regret telling her the truth and it is still satisfying that she knows the truth. But you should do what is best for you OP. I'm just super petty.", "Why do you want to visit your lying, abusive, cheating, alcoholic ex? What's in it for you? A bit like wanting your ex mil to know your side of the story, it feels like you're hanging on to something that's not worth your time.", "Thank you. He\u2019s sober now and he\u2019s apologized. I come from a broken family where both my parents remarried 3+ times each. I kept in touch with my 2 ex steps dads because I grew up with them and spent so much time with them, and I guess I\u2019ve always tried to be inclusive and forgiving and maintain my relationships even when hurt has been involved. Thinking about it now, I guess I might do this as a kind of trauma response to try and keep everything happy and feel like I have some semblance of control. I get it though and you\u2019re 100% right. I\u2019m realizing now that I should probably just let this one go."]}
