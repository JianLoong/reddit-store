Those kids are your step kids now, you are now a guardian of two children and your attitude is not of someone who realises that fact. I think you and your wife need to have a real conversation about how you both see your lives together and what expectations you both have of your role in your family. Because yes, this is YOUR family, someone said their dad is a deadbeat, I assume you knew that when you married her so step up as their stepparent. You took on that job when you got married.

Sounds to me like you spoil your niece with love and material posessions which is a very sweet thing to do.\nBut I think this is less about the car and more about the balance. These are obviously all assumptions so if you disagree please correct me OP.\n\nYou and your wife married a year ago and have been dating 13 years before that and she has two kids. You clearly state in your text that you like them and you get along which to me reads as not parental and staying at a distance. This isn't wrong in my opinion, especially when the kids have trouble with all the new changes that come with a blended family. (Edit: apparently not new bc bio dad is a deadbeat and you've been a consistent influence in their lives for over a decade?)\n\nBut it sounds like she feels her kids being overlooked in favor of your niece. You might see this differently but to her, the bond between her kids and her husband does impact her well being. Have you ever discussed with the kids how they feel about this? Maybe they want to bond with you more but feel like you won't be open to that. I don't know how open you are to them that you are child free but that might feel to them like you don't like them. They are young and may feel rejected because they won't be able to understand the gray area that step kids are. Also, yes you are child free biologicially but you married a woman with kids so you knew that they would also be part of your life. Making sure you guys feel comfortable and are open in your communication towards each other is the key to a blended family.\n\nIf I was in your position I would plan a day out with her kids, just you three. Maybe they can suggest a fun activity and you can take that time to ask them how they feel about your role. It doesn't have to be a huge thing but you can ask them how they want you to be involved (or not). I don't know if their dad is still present and if he is it also might be good to add that you don't want to replace that, but that you do want them to feel like they can come to you if they feel invisible.

If she wanted to be somewhere near reasonable she would have discussed beforehand a possibility to get a car for the girl including the 3 way share of the costs: you, bio dad, mom. To expect to pop up with a car like is a pair of socks is a bit outrageous, regardless if you can afford it or not. Now i get you say childfree by choice, plus you came into her kids life quite late in their life, but then the right term you would use is \" my wife's daughter\"..... Sounds cold and distant, right? But if you call her stepdaughter then you loose the \"childfree\" term. Those 2 dont fit together tbh. Your choice.

Work on fixing your relationship with your stepchild and communication with your wife. \n\nYou met your stepdaughter when she was at a very formative time in her life, as an early teenager, and have continued to not recognize her as your child.

I don't see where he talks more about this.\n\nAlso just saw the edit where OP says he was dating the mom for 13 years, not 3 and he told his wife the gift was a surprise. Which makes the assumption on her part a bit more understandable. We don't know where they are in the world, but definitely in the US, the 16th birthday is a big deal, possibly because, in a lot of states, it's the age at which children can legally get a license to drive. Because of that, a car at that age is a fairly common gift for those than can afford it. \n\nOP says the stepdaughter doesn't think of him as her dad. That's surprising considering he's apparently been her mother's partner since she was 3 years old. Still, even if she thinks of him as an uncle/close family friend, that would give him the same or a similar relationship to her as the niece for whom OP helped buy a car four months ago. I still don't think the setups are equivalent, but it does make the wife's assumption, which I initially thought was a rather big leap on her part, make more sense, especially since OP confirms that he stepped in to help his niece get her \"dream car\" (upgraded from the second hand car her father was going to buy her himself) and that OP confirms that he can afford to buy the stepdaughter a car himself, but he would just rather spend his money on other things, though he would be willing to contribute a few hundred to a car for his stepdaughter.\n\nYeah, I think we need some more information.", "I agree fully but I don\u2019t think we have the full story and the wife never communicated she wanted a car I can give more reasons he isn\u2019t exactly the AH for example: his daughter can legally work some jobs, his wife should\u2019ve communicated a car would be a good present for the daughter, his wife could\u2019ve bought the car herself.

If not,  he's definitely not the TA.", "The mother just set an unreasonable expectation, told the daughter w/o ever consulting OP and ran with it. The mother assumed he would outright 100% fund a car for the daughter.
