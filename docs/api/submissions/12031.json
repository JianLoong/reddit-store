Those kids are your step kids now, you are now a guardian of two children and your attitude is not of someone who realises that fact. I think you and your wife need to have a real conversation about how you both see your lives together and what expectations you both have of your role in your family. Because yes, this is YOUR family, someone said their dad is a deadbeat, I assume you knew that when you married her so step up as their stepparent. You took on that job when you got married.

There\u2019s NO reason she should have had an expectation that you would show up with a car for HER daughter.

Sounds to me like you spoil your niece with love and material posessions which is a very sweet thing to do.\nBut I think this is less about the car and more about the balance. These are obviously all assumptions so if you disagree please correct me OP.\n\nYou and your wife married a few years ago, and she has two kids. You clearly state in your text that you like them and you get along which to me reads as not parental and staying at a distance. This isn't wrong in my opinion, especially when the kids have trouble with all the new changes that come with a blended family.\n\nBut it sounds like she feels her kids being overlooked in favor of your niece. You might see this differently but to her, the bond between her kids and her husband does impact her well being. Have you ever discussed with the kids how they feel about this? Maybe they want to bond with you more but feel like you won't be open to that. I don't know how open you are to them that you are child free but that might feel to them like you don't like them. They are young and may feel rejected because they won't be able to understand the gray area that step kids are. Also, yes you are child free biologicially but you married a woman with kids so you knew that they would also be part of your life. Making sure you guys feel comfortable and are open in your communication towards each other is the key to a blended family.\n\nIf I was in your position I would plan a day out with her kids, just you three. Maybe they can suggest a fun activity and you can take that time to ask them how they feel about your role. It doesn't have to be a huge thing but you can ask them how they want you to be involved (or not). I don't know if their dad is still present and if he is it also might be good to add that you don't want to replace that, but that you do want them to feel like they can come to you if they feel invisible.\n\nGoodluck OP", "NTA - She has a mother and presumably a father.  Even a deadbeat, she still has a mother.  \n\n Why isn't mommy forking out for it?

OP mentioned stepdaughter don\u2019t see him as a dad so I don\u2019t think he has to buy her a car. He got her a really nice bag that she wanted which should be enough.

For your niece were 3 grown-ups pitching in for a car, 3 direct relatives, including her own father and obviously discussed before. Your wife is very entitled to expect a car solely from your side, with zero sharing of the costs with her and the girl's bio dad. If she wanted to be somewhere near reasonable she would have discussed beforehand a possibility to get a car for the girl including the 3 way share of the costs: you, bio dad, mom. To expect to pop up with a car like is a pair of socks is a bit outrageous, regardless if you can afford it or not. Now i get you say childfree by choice, plus you came into her kids life quite late in their life, but then the right term you would use is \" my wife's daughter\"..... Sounds cold and distant, right? But if you call her stepdaughter then you loose the \"childfree\" term. Those 2 dont fit together tbh. Your choice. Regardless, \"stepdaughter\" or \"wife's daughter\", your wife's entitlement is through the roof and alarming.

I say this as a mom who remarried - if your wife wanted a father for her kids, that should\u2019ve been discussed and agreed to ahead of time with regards to expectations. My husband didn\u2019t become a father-figure to my kids immediately - it was gradual, and I sure as hell would not expect him to buy either of them anything huge, definitely not a car. \n\nYour wife and your stepdaughter have some unrealistic expectations here and I would suggest marital and/or family counseling to get y\u2019all on the same page.", "NTA\u2014 but how did you wife NOT know that you didn\u2019t buy her a car?", "YTA for fostering this lack of family atmosphere. A step-parent is part of the parental unit. It's literally in the name. I'm a step parent(who also has no biological children) so I get the situation you are in. But I took the exact opposite philosophy as you and now my comparenting situation has none of these issues. Work on fixing your relationship with your stepchild and communication with your wife. \n\nYou met your stepdaughter when she was at a very formative time in her life, as an early teenager, and have continued to not recognize her as your child.

When the pandemic hit, we formed a bubble with my kids' dad and his wife -- who also committed to being a loving and devoted parent to our children when she married him, and who has become my greatest ally in that household because she can run things very effectively -- and then we'd hang out together, since neither of us were allowed to see anybody else during that time.\n\nIt is certainly possible to have a marriage without a family.
