Your fianc\u00e9s reaction raises a lot of red flags.", "What if she has children? Will you be prevented from seeing your grandkids?", "You're not TAH. You're husband is one very insecure AH though.", "You sure can pick 'em. My advice would be to not marry this person. I can't imagine how bad life alone would have to be to warrant wanting to escape it by entering this utter hell.", "NTA! She IS family. You are a very good step-parent, looks like your fiance is already failing at the job.\nSeriously, is this man really expecting you to choose between him and your child (blood or not)???", "WTF is wrong with your fiance?? This would be my HTDO (inviting Lucy that is). She is your daughter.", "You helped raise her as your child. You divorce spouses not children. Think long and hard if you want this man as a husband and stepfather to your children. How long before your children become a problem in this \"chapter together\" because they're not his children? NTA", "NTA. Your fiance is being ridiculous. Why does he think he has the right to prevent what is essentially your child from celebrating with you? And why are you letting him?", "NTA that is your family. Period. She deserves to be there and you WANT her there.", "This would be a Hill to die on for me. This man you want to marry can\u2019t get over himself enough to honor a relationship you value WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS BASICALLY YOUR CHILD. \n\nIs he fucking kidding? Like\u2026 if he can\u2019t look at someone without being like \u201cugh your dad used to fuck my wife\u201d that\u2019s on him. Both for being juvenile enough that that is his prevailing thought AND FOR TELLING YOU that he doesn\u2019t want her there. It has nothing to do with you. It has everything to do with his insecurity.", "Nta. I also can't believe you would ask him that because of course she would be invited. It sounds like yo love her. She could possibly even be in it. The new husband is not so nice.", "NTA. Why is he so insecure? You raised her as a daughter, that is totally valid that you still want a relationship with her. Of course, you should invite her. Leaving her out would belittle that relationship.", "NTA- She\u2019s family. Your fianc\u00e9 is an idiot.", "NTA. He is unreasonable. She is the type of person you want present at your wedding. I fail to see his reasoning.", "NTA\nLucy is your daughter and family too. You raised her for 14 years and are still close to her after your divorce from her father. Lucy is an adult and not your ex husband. Your fianc\u00e9  is a very insecure person if  he feels threatened by this relationship.", "NTA.  Stick to your guns and keep treating Lucy like your own.  She has every right to be there and enjoy the day with you.", "NTA. I know it's popular to suggest breaking up on here, but if he doesn't relent I wouldn't marry him.  There are two sides to this wedding.  You aren't crossing off anyone on his side.", "Family is often chosen. You are NTA for choosing to make her your family. Then, or now. \n\nYou need to dive into this with fianc\u00e9 and see if this is any indication of the future. \n\nLike, \"why go visit\" when stepdaughter starts a family.\n\nJust as important, what about his relationship with your kids and their families in the future?\n\nIt looks like he considers \"family\" blood relationship. You need to know what his definition really means.", "NTA  I have nothing to add to what others have. The relationship with your stepdaughter is important.", "Sounds like, if he could, he probably wouldn't want the children you have with Ron there, too.\n\nNTA.  It's wonderful that you have a good relationship with her. Step parents get a bad rep. You did good.", "Omg- your fianc\u00e9 sounds like a huge AH.  My husband has a stepson who he also raised from the time he was 3-4\u2026 and OF COURSE he was at our wedding last year.  In addition to being invited to family gatherings,etc.\n\nYou better think carefully about this relationship\u2026 husband\u2019s stepson how has twin babies and we are trying to be as involved as possible in their lives.  When Lucy gets to this point consider how hurt you will feel if your maybe-by-then husband is not supportive of being in the lives of future \u2018grand babies\u2019.\n\nMore love and more family is a good thing!", "NTA, but your fianc\u00e9 is being one. \n\nI imagine there's more to this sudden and seemingly out of character (?) outburst. Maybe talk to him about it when cooler heads prevail. \n\nEither way, Lucy should ABSOLUTELY be at your wedding, 100%. She's your daughter. Your fianc\u00e9 *must* understand that biology is such a narrow definition of family. It also seems like she has chosen you over her bio dad again and again. You are *her* chosen family. And that's an honor and testament to you both as mother and daughter.", "NTA. She\u2019s not *like* family, she *is* family.", "NTA.  Good for you. She is old enough to make her own decision.", "NTA, she is your daughter, too. You fianc\u00e9 needs to stop being so insecure. Hell, invite Ron, too, if you\u2019re on good terms.", "NTA\n\nI'd rethink this whole relationship if my fiance was angry that I wanted to invite someone I raised as my own. His argument sounds like he's jealous you were married previously. I'm guessing Lucy called you mom and everything since she was so young and you two were close.", "You divorce spouses not kids. They want to be part of your life after the fact then good on you. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThe mask is slipping. If you don't choose between fiance and Lucy now, you will definitely be forced to soon, only by then you'll be married.", "NTA - Take a good hard look at this situation. Are you 100% certain you want to marry someone who feels this way? How soon before your biological children are being pushed aside and left out of things? This reaction would make me EXTREMELY uncomfortable with moving forward.", "She is your daughter. If he doesn\u2019t agree with her being invited to your wedding, kick him to the curb!", "NTA. Your raised her and she sees you as a mother figure, to the point that taking your side openly when her dad was wrong. It\u2019s just sad that he won\u2019t understand. Lucy and Ron are two separate people who play very different role in your life. Can\u2019t he just tell ppl that Lucy is fully yours, like your other two bio kids. Since she\u2019s like you bio kid anyway.", "To quote Clueless \u201cYou divorce wives not children\u201d", "My \"SIL\" is my mother. She and my brother raised me, and she treated me like her own from the beginning. They ended up divorcing when I was 18-19 and I was expected to drop her. It was a very long and rough few years, but I made it through. I still tried to keep my relationship with my brother because of an unspoken rule being to never bring her up in his presence. It worked.....until it didn't. My mom was getting remarried almost 3 years later and I was to take part in it of course. When my brother found out he exploded and told me if I still went to that wedding he would consider my betrayal the end of our relationship and I would be disowned. I cried to my mom and she told me she wanted me to be at peace and happy and would be okay if I missed it. That it wouldn't mean anything and she still loved me. It clicked all right there who really had my best interest at heart and I never looked back. Paperwork does not make family, your heart does. Let this be the hill you die on. NTA in the slightest.", "NTA  The commenter who said this is the hill to die on is totally correct.  I'd give him one more chance to get over himself and if he can't accept she will be there, the wedding is off.  I had my ex and his wife to my wedding and my new partner had zero issues with that.  I personally would not marry him.  His rejection of her shows he doesn't actually care about you only how he is perceived.", "The marinara flags are strong in this one. NTA", "First it\u2019s excluding her from the wedding next it\u2019s excluding her from the home\n\nEditing to add NTA and I\u2019d seriously reconsider marrying this man, my parents have been split up 15 ish years and my father is still a part of my eldest brothers life despite not being biologically related and if he attempted to exclude him like this I wouldn\u2019t be forgiving, think about how your two bio kids would feel knowing your partner doesn\u2019t like their big sister due to their father aka 50% of them", "NTA   \nthis", "He is not being weird, he is being cruel.", "Yea his next target be the bio kids", "If he can make you uninvite the girl you practically raised and who has remained your good friend despite the history with her father.", "That mask is slipping, op. I would put a hold on marring this guy bc seems to me that after you two are married, he may just start treating all your kids like crap and even worse if the two of you have a kid together.", "Then you need to be asking yourself, what else is he hiding .", "That makes this like a 1000x worse.  He knows her and is slamming the door in her face?  Nuh uh.  Wouldn't happen with my kid", "He is going to expect all that to stop once you get married.", "This right here. I can completely see this as a control issue, especially since the AH never complained before, even when OP brought her OLDEST DAUGHTER along with. The fact he's pulling this over the wedding and using terms like \"baggage\", I can guarantee it won't be long before he's insisting OP cut SD out of her life period. I think the fiance is acutely aware of the fact that SD is a big part of OP's support system since SD chose OP in the divorce with OP's ex, and he doesn't want OP to have that shoulder to lean on anymore."]}
