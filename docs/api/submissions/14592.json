Ron and I had two children together, and Ron had a daughter named Lucy from a previously relationship. When we were married Lucy was only 4, so I raised her like  my own and was very close with her. Ron and I divorced due to him being a drunk and abusive, and Lucy was on my side and supported me through the whole divorce as she was the only one of the children really old enough to have witnessed and understood the issues and abuse. We kept in contact to this day and are still just as close. Ron and I have been divorced almost 5 years.\n\nI am now engaged to my long term fianc\u00e9 of 3 years and are planning my wedding and I had thought to invite Lucy, assuming my fianc\u00e9e would be alright with it since he had met Lucy on many different occasions and I consider her family. When I brought this up to him, he immediately shut it down and said that would be weird to have my ex husbands daughter at our wedding. I then pointed out how my two other children were also my ex husbands children and that they would be there, and he just said that was different. I then pointed out how he never had any issues any of the times he\u2019s met her or when she\u2019s had sleepovers at our house, and that she was practically my child, and that I really wanted her to be there. \n\nThis caused a big argument, and he said that having Lucy there would be like having Ron there, and that he couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d even ask him that, he went on to say how this was our new chapter together and I couldn\u2019t be bringing Ron baggage into it, and that I was I being selfish for even considering inviting her.\n\nI don\u2019t see why it\u2019s such an unreasonable request.
