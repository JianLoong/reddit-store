His shifts are all over the place and are often 5-6 hours a day, Monday-Friday. I work full time in a salaried position that I have been at for 12 years. Every day I get up and get my daughter to school and then I start working (I work from home). I wake my bf up when it's time for him to get ready for work (he usually starts around 10-11am most days). Every day seems to be a fight to get up with him not wanting to go to work and often asking me for permission to stay home. When he stays home from work he sits and plays video games all day while I work at my desk. He can be loud and distracting. When he does go to work I drive him and pick him up. He's constantly making up excuses for why he can't go in. I'm shocked he hasn't been fired yet because he has a tendency to take off a full week and not just a day here and there. Today I have the day off as I am trying to use up my vacation time before the end of the year. When I woke him up this morning he got angry with me when I told him he had to go to work because he has only worked 4 hours this week. He said he was sick of having to work all these hours just for his paychecks to go to meand that I just don't want him home so I can do whatever I had planned for myself today. Last month he worked so few hours that he didn't have enough money to give me the $600 towards rent that he told me he would pay which basically left me to pay all the bills. For reference our rent is $2300 + hydro and utilities so when he doesn't give me that money it is a significant amount that I have to cover on top of my other responsibilities. If he worked even just his set hours every week he would have money for himself because I only ask for $600 month.\n\nI'm so tired of having to shoulder all the financial responsibilities as well as making sure he gets to work in the first place. I'm tired of being yelled at every morning for making him go. I feel like I'm his mother not his partner. I have told him this several times but he never wants to talk about it and somehow it gets turned around on me for not being supportive of him and that I'm not perfect either. He constantly brings up that there are things I do or don't do that he doesn't like but he doesn't nag me about them, but he never tells me what those things are.\n\nAm I the asshole here for making him go to work when he doesn't want to? Am I just a nag?\n\n***Update*** I have read all your comments so far. For those of you who commented about my past post history, you're 100% correct that I have been complaining about him for a long time. I take full responsibility for my role in this, that I have completely enabled this behavior on his part and I am definitely the AH for that. I have been getting the silent treatment all day from him and any time I try saying anything he just walks away or ignores me. Thank you for the support and the criticism. I don't know why I haven't walked away yet. I know I am setting a terrible example for my daughter.", "created_utc": 1700850864, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182ypi9/aita_my_40f_bf_34m_got_angry_with_me_this_morning/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
