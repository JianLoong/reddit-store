Unfortunately, this popularity has led to her and her friends being extremely cruel to others girls in the past. \n\nOne of her most defining features is her incredibly long hair. It is wavy, a beautiful light gold and goes down to about her waist. She is obsessed with her looks and has been caught skipping class before to style her hair in the bathroom with her friends. \n\nLast night, she was on the phone with some of her friends and they were talking about a girl (14F) in their school who has gotten pregnant. She was taken advantage of by a family friend from what I had heard and was being forced to keep the baby due to the abortion laws in our state. \n\nMy daughter was laughing about this. I was horrified by what I heard her say. She said that the girl was so ugly and had such short hair no man would risk jail time for her. She also poked fun at the cultural hairstyles the girl wears- she is African American, among other racial comments. I also heard comments about her weight. For context my daughter is a slender white girl. I was outraged. I immediately got her off the phone and told her I was incredibly disappointed and tomorrow she was getting a much needed haircut. She laughed at me and walked off, thinking I was joking. \n\nWell, this morning I followed through with my promise. I sat her down at the table and cut her hair to about chest length. I am a hairdresser and it is still nowhere near her shoulders so it is a fine haircut. She screamed and cried afterwards telling me I was abusing her and her life was over. I told her she will get her hair back but that poor girl will never be able to take back what happened to her. \n\nAITA?\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nHello everyone. First of all, I\u2019d like to thank you all for the ranges of advice I have received on this post. I will have a talk with her soon to explain the course of action. I admit I have raised her like this and should have put my foot down but have not in fear of an arguement- I try not to argue with my children for my own personal reasons. I turned a blind eye to this as I didn\u2019t want to believe my own child could be so heartless and thought she would grow out of it. The reason I reacted so harshly and irrationally was I had a very close friend since kindergarten who was a victim of the same crime and took her life because of this. I have also contacted the school and the parents of the others on the call. I have decided to enroll her in therapy which she will start soon. She will also be volunteering at the local women\u2019s shelter 3 days a week and on Saturday as well instead of her usual figure skating. There has been tension in the family since the passing of her elder sister- the reason I don\u2019t argue with my kids. I may get her an appointment for some extensions as her hair has been really bothering her. However, it is her birthday coming up soon and am wondering what to do for that. If anyone has any advice on what to do I would very much appreciate it. I will also be limiting contact with these friends.", "created_utc": 1687633152, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14i0o0n/aita_for_making_my_daughter_cut_her_hair_after/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP only has a few more years to try and fix her daughter", "Yeah I mean in general I would wonder how much of a positive effect you can have on a person via the use of punishment. I would favor curtailing anything in her life that reinforces these attitudes, which might be construed by her as a punishment, but is also just going to be important in helping her change (like, say, taking her phone so she can't be chatting with friends who reinforce her attitudes). And then additionally, finding ways to build empathy and having deep talks about things.", "The last thing she needs is to be in a position of power over vulnerable people.", "Making a kid spend time with people who see as less than them doesn\u2019t teach them empathy. OP shout have taught empathy years ago.", "Exactly. I am curious why her daughter is so cruel, must have gotten it from somewhere.", "You wrote Y T A first, so your comment will count as that.", "14 is certainly old enough to understand that bullying is wrong, cutting class for her own vanity is wrong, and that no one deserves SA. She\u2019s choosing to of ignore what she knows is right for the sake of her own ego. This is absolutely a lesson that needed to happen. I personally don\u2019t think OP did enough. I\u2019d be marching her down to a women\u2019s shelter every weekend to volunteer for the kind of people she felt so superior to.", "If 14 is old enough to deal with racism, 14 is old enough to know how not to be racist.", "oh please she is most definitely old enough to understand what she did was wrong. i agree that jumping straight to the hair was a wrong move, but cmon. she knows she's being racist and she knows no one deserves to be assaulted", "I did and the issue was dealt with by the school.", "There are sooo many other ways to punish someone that don\u2019t involve forcibly altering their appearance.", "Please don't ever procreate.", "There was a lot of arguing before hand but I told her either she sit still and let me cut it evenly or move around and she can have choppy and uneven hair. The screaming and crying I mentioned was both before and after, not strictly one of them.", "Yes, as I said in the update, family therapy is a route we will be taking", "I agree. She sounds obsessed and jealous of her own daughter and used this as an opportunity to act out her feelings. This is not addressing the kid's racism or lack of empathy for abuse victims.", "Yes there are a few schools nearby, but I am waiting to confer with my husband as this would be a descion we both need to agree on.", "I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.\n\nRespectfully, you need individual therapy and your daughter does, too.\n\nIt is not your fault your elder daughter died.\n\nHowever, you do need to grieve, forgive yourself, and repair this earth-shattering void in your life so that you can parent your remaining children.\n\nI say this with empathy and love (my nephew passed tragically and my sister blamed herself, too).", "y'all have really been through some complex trauma.  Please definitely seek family therapy, and individual therapy for the both of you.  I'm sorry for your loss.", "OP, I am really sorry that happened to your family. It must make it difficult to confront your children about issues and it sounds like you have some anxiety around that. Both family and individual counselling would do you and your kids a world of good. They deserve a mother who can call them out and teach them, and you deserve to let go of the blame and shame you've been carrying around. Best of luck, I'm rooting for you.", "Agreed.  Taking her a victims advocate panel where survivors of abuse openly talk about their experiences would be better.", "Honestly agree. The daughter is going to keep tabs on the shelter women\u2019s stories and big mouth to all her nasty friends like it\u2019s some tv drama when it\u2019s real people facing real danger.\n\nEdit: EHS the fact that she is fr a flaming racist at 14 and you have never taught her otherwise up til now had my jaw on the floor", "I agree with this statement, though as someone who has both volunteered  and worked at a domestic violence / sexual assualt shelter, it is very likely she won't be working with clients. She will have to go through training ro understand the dynamics of sexual assault amd domestic violence as well as the importance of confidentiality. They'll likely put her on cleaning duties. They may also have public awareness programs she could take / help fundraise/promote.\n\nAlthough, OP could be doing some of this herself. There's documentaries out there like Victim/Suspect and other books that daughter could do reports on.", "Also, I don't think they let just anyone in to volunteer there, let alone children. Shelter locations have to remain secure. People's lives depend on it. However, shelters for homeless families do take volunteers, and that might be a good way to give Miss I'm All That a good reality check.", "It would teach a child some empathy. Nobody is suggesting she go in unsupervised.", "This asshole \"Subject victims to more abusers in what should be a safe place for them!\"\n \nYou \"top fucking marks what a lad!\"\n \nJesus McMotherfuckin Christ.", "How is the racism not important to address? It's not one or the other.", "Sometimes kids her age can\u2019t fully understand just how bad something is until they\u2019ve seen it in contrast to their own lives. She was old enough to know that her actions were inexcusable, but given that she went ahead and did what she did, I think she needs a big reality check and visiting a shelter and talking to an employee about the things they see could be a life-altering lesson.", "Oh shoot I didn't know that\ud83d\ude05", "Oopsie!! The point sailed right over your head, much like OP.  Her daughter wasn't 'bullying' anyone. The girl wasn't there. So her friends and her made some inappropriate jokes that the girl never heard of and did not affect her.   \n\n\nYou sound demented just like OP who sounds actually jealous of her daughter's 'long, golden, wavy hair' and was more concerned with her 'vanity' which sounds like bitter middle aged derangement and has nothing to with what she said. What's next, throwing acid in her face to keep her humble?   \nMarching her down to the women's shelter to volunteer would actually make sense and not be some weird punishment that is problematic in its own way. Making her take a class or talk to a survivor or watch a special etc would also make sense. Cutting her hair off is bizarre and only makes sense to petty vindictive hags", "I never said she's not old enough to deal with racism. The mental gymnastics it takes to get this conclusion from my sentence is wild. She's obviously raised by a racist as well and needs instruction which she's definitely old enough for. The willful misunderstanding is so confusing to me", "Of course she knows she is wrong but she needs to understand why. Cutting her hair isn't teaching her anything. She definitely needs to know more about her racism and misogyny. But cutting someone's hair off isn't doing anything to teach them", "Perspective.", "Lol, nah, I will.", "Your daughter was cruel and childish for what she said about that girl, but can you imagine for one second how it made her feel for her parent to give her an ultimatum about something she holds so precious. \"Sit still darling whilst I, your loving parent, greatly alter something you take pride and joy in.\" Just because it's something that will go back to normal in time, you think it's ok? That's no better than a parent destroying a kids favourite toy or something they worked really hard on the create. \n\nShe won't have learned a damn thing about respecting others from this because you showed her the ultimate disrespect. All she's learned is that you will take what is precious to her if she does something you don't like.", "She needs to be away from them", "Thank you very much for your words. This incident has really opened my eyes and made me realise that ultimately hanging onto my anger isn\u2019t healthy and that isn\u2019t what she would have wanted. My daughter never really knew her sister as she has passed when she was young. I will have family and individual counselling for all of us as I think it would be beneficial to help release some of the pain it caused.", "So if the abused girl was white, it wouldn't be any big deal to say cruel things about her?", "Do you think that kids can't show that they're disdainful and full of attitude while supervised? \n\nIt would cause the victims of violence more distress. People who have experienced shitty stuff are not learning tools for bigoted children.", "So they should waste the time of another volunteer to babysit her so she can possibly learn to be a decent human at 14?", "Because, again, the girl's race is not the issue. Being cruel to a black girl is not worse than being cruel to a white girl. OP's daughter needs to learn empathy and compassion for all humans.", "People in poverty and who are unhoused are just that, people.  \n\nThey are not examples, props or teaching tools.  \n\nOP can find and pay for a trained licensed professional to help instead of using people.", "Oh I loooove when someone automatically stoops to demeaning a person. It really highlights just how silly they are! So thank you for giving us all a heads up.\n\nI was a girl with the curly, waist-length hair. I get how big of a deal it is to cut it. Her mom didn\u2019t buzz her head. And the kid had shown that her hair was not only a distraction from school, but a way of trying to elevate herself over someone in a classist/racist/sexist way. \n\nAnd to compare a haircut to an acid attack is hyperbolic. Or to use your word, \u201cdemented\u201d.", ">ESH your kid is a callous AH but she's too young to probably understand.\n\nIt's that sentence. She's not too young.", "Freaking yikes.", "It takes two to tango, so I hope nobody does it with you.", "I have hope she will learn from this, as I have explained in the update and have decided I will get her fixed for extensions whilst the hair grows back.", "I never said that. I\u2019m talking about this scenario that op presented.", "I'd say if there is a way to volunteer without interacting with the recipients that might be appropriate.  Eg boxing a care box.", "So you're saying she needs to be taught lessons about sexual assault, but not racism? She should just be allowed to continue the racist bullying? That makes no sense. She did more than one thing wrong, and it needs to be addressed at multiple points because of that.", "You\u2019re right, I completely agree! That\u2019s why I would have her speak with an employee to learn a bit. I didn\u2019t detail it enough, but I meant volunteering in an age-appropriate and respectful way. Our shelters have opportunities to help with clothes sorting, food collections, and other things that are no-contact with the people they serve. I had to pass a background check to volunteer in an interactive way due to the need for confidentiality of the victims.", "Oooooh I love when when someone thinks cutting a child's hair and taking away her bodily autonomy is 'absolutely a lesson that needs to be learned' as though that is not demeaning. I absolutely stand by demented as it applies. You seem like someone who would cut your daughter's hair to 'teach her a lesson'. It's a slippery slope that leads to that sort of thinking which is why I used it. I was also a girl with curly waist length hair and would have learned nothing but how my mother was unwell and jealous if she'd cut my hair against my will", "She is too young to understand the underpinnings of her bigotry if the parents she has are racist themselves. I highly doubt she understands exactly why what she said was wrong. She needs to learn why instead of having her hair cut and calling it a day", "Also racism doesn't always even necessarily correlate with age. Many racists die being racist. My point was she is a child in need of instruction.", "Clearly, you're regretting your actions because you're trying to back track by \"undoing\" the damage with the extensions and looking to buy her something nice for her birthday.\nBut don't you think this might be part of the problem? An over the top, nonsensical punishment, followed by \"sticking plaster\" fix and buying her back with presents? That's going to mess with her head. Are you planning on some joint sessions with the counselling? Because I really think you should.", "The fact that people are focusing on her race, instead of what horrible things were done to her, is saying exactly that.", "There is no sense talking to someone who refuses to listen. Do you understand the words EMPATHY and COMPASSION for everyone, or are they too complicated? Nowhere did I say she should be taught about sexual assault either, though she should be. Knowledge is power. I said she should learn to be kind to everyone. Now go ahead and twist that around.", "Ooo! Yeah, let\u2019s keep this going. I would absolutely explain to my child that cutting class to play with their hair had consequences. And I\u2019d be willing to follow through with it. And I\u2019d absolutely be willing to chop some inches off in this instance and be sure to explain to her that however sad she is about it she\u2019s is about it it\u2019ll grow back. And while it\u2019s growing back she can continue think on her privilege and why her behavior was inexcusable. Only thing I\u2019d have done differently regarding the hair cut is given her the choice to cut even shorter and donate it to an organization that makes wigs for sick people.", "I 100% agree with you. It gives me the same feeling I had growing up with I get when I hear about a dad not letting his daughter cut her long hair. It\u2019s a very bizarre way to discipline someone.", "Yes family therapy. I do regret my actions and wish I had waited an thought about what to do beforehand, not that it makes much of a difference", "Right, but I didn\u2019t mention daughter\u2019s race in my comment. Feel free to go take up beef with comments who did.", "I highly doubt she was cutting class only 'to play with her hair' even if that's what she spent her time doing. Cutting it off would not automatically cause her to focus. She'd skip class for something else. Maybe to smoke or hang out with friends. You've made it clear this is how you would treat a child who would hate you and learn nothing from it. I understand your stance.  It's great for your own ego, but some 14 year old isn't going to take anything useful about privilege from that.", "That\u2019s controlling someone to uphold a stereotype and imo a complete different set of circumstances.", "It's not even about discipline. It's about exercising force and control and being a tyrant. Whoever does this will make their kid worse. Why not teach them why it's wrong instead?", "I am talking about the race of the abused girl, that everyone is focusing on, instead of what was done to her.", "It wouldn\u2019t have to do with my ego. In fact it\u2019s parents that refuse to take this stuff seriously that are focusing on their own ego. They need to be the good guy or to keep the shiny spotlight on their kid so they seem like some little darling. \n\nHopefully OP\u2019s kid can overcome her trauma and go on to live the long-haired life she\u2019s so seriously needs. Because that\u2019s the real example of victimization in this whole story. And hopefully she can avoid whatever slippery slope you\u2019re talking about falling down. First a haircut = acid attack, now it\u2019s the gateway to a potential lifetime of victimization?/s", "Still creepy and weird. Part of the reason (at least I think) my son talks to me a lot about his life is because I don\u2019t do unhinged shit like this. And no he\u2019s not a spoiled brat; he treats me with respect and kindness which is how I treat him. If he ever doesn\u2019t, one thing I won\u2019t be doing is cutting his hair to humiliate him. So odd that this is the first inclination.", "You are controlling someone and it's a form of assault to take away bodily autonomy from a kid and exercise your force over her and change her body in a way she doesn't consent to and that's why it's particularly gross. What you said earlier about taking her to a women's shelter, etc is fine and makes a lot of sense. That's how she'll learn she's being privileged and mean. But veering over into 'she is vain' sounds puritanical and backwards an more to do with your own sadism. And the performative 'give her hair for a wig' still doesn't make it ethical", "But in this particular situation it was a race thing? It's cruel either way obviously, even if the victimized girl in the story had been white, but she's not, and a lot of the comments made by OP's daughter WAS focused on her race. So it's trash either way that the abused girl had to go through what she did, and the way her future has been stolen from her due to this, and it's awful of OP's daughter to make any comments about her or her situation at all. But again, she did make racist remarks, so?", "Why conflate taking racism seriously with cutting a kid's hair? This is terrible parenting and the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Obviously she is expressing the racism and bigotry she was already raised with. And a mom cutting her hair and pretending to be morally superior to the kid she raised with a lot of bigotry is not addressing the real issue in any way", "Exactly. The punishment should fit the crime. Humiliating a child and making them never want to trust you again instead of correcting their ignorance isn't going to make them treat anyone better. In fact it might make them worse", "So OP's daughter needs to learn empathy and compassion for everyone."]}
