She came to me not too long ago and asked me why I moved away and didn't really come home again. She told me how she felt like she lost me but that she also lost our brothers and that she felt like the odd one out, like she wasn't our real sibling and she wanted to know why this happened. I gave her a vague answer at first but she pushed repeatedly so I told her.\n\nBG. My sister was 3 and I was 12 when our mom died. Our brothers were 7, 8 and 10. After mom died I became like a second mom figure to her and babysat her a lot. My brother's were all in school and extra curricular's so didn't need as much babysitting as she did. We were all very close though. My relationship with my sister was a little different. When I was 15 my dad remarried and it was very hard on me. My sister bonded with her immediately which made it harder. Dad and his wife were expecting a baby within a year of their marriage too which added to that toughness for me. Dad and I had a bad relationship with all of this going on. We first fought after he sat me and my brother's down and asked us to consider letting his wife adopt us. I was pissed he would ever ask that. He was pissed at my reaction as well as my immediate refusal. Then it was over my half sibling and my lack of interest in them. I did not babysit willingly or eagerly like I did with my sister. I made it clear I did not want to babysit the baby. I also didn't spend the same amount of time with them as I did my brothers. I rushed through high school and worked my ass off so I could leave as soon as possible which I did. After I moved out for college I went to another state and didn't go back to them anymore. I saw my brothers, which my dad allowed, but he was not okay with me seeing my sister and kept her back. My brother's all moved out once they were at the age where they could and all moved to be closer to me. Two of them lived with me for a while at first.\n\nAs we spoke my sister told me how it ruined everything because the boys followed me and then she and her mom (dad's wife, she calls her mom) ended up having a strained relationship because she always compared her to me and how I did things. I was honest with everything about my feelings and my reasonings for moving so far away. She started to get angry and told me it was a shitty reason and how could I destroy her chances of the family unit she wanted, because clearly that would never happen. Then she told me I shouldn't have dumped all that on her. Then it came back to me leaving and how she missed me and hated that we weren't close. She told me it was too much for her to handle and her feelings were  a mess and it was all my fault because I dumped everything on her.\n\nShe did ask but I feel bad. I love my sister and I hate seeing what the truth has done to her, and even to us, because there's anger there now. AITA?\n\nETA: My sister used to compare dad's wife to me, not dad's wife comparing my sister to me. I realize now that was not super easy to follow. This happened after I was gone and with the memories my sister had of me taking care of her.", "created_utc": 1674640521, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10kv54v/aita_for_being_honest_with_my_sister_about_why_i/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I knew this might be a lot for her but I told her anyway because she wanted to know and had pushed the issue. I can see what it has done to her and that makes me question whether I should have made up another reason. This was possibly more than she could handle when she already feels left out and was struggling with the distance between her and our brothers and I.

Your actions were understandable,  but she's in a lot of pain and confusion,  as she says.  The fact that she acknowledges her feelings are a mess shows she isn't truly blaming you,  she's simply trying to come to terms with all of this.  I guess she sort of sees you as a mother who rejected her, which makes sense given that she probably doesn't remember your actual mother.  And,  let's face it,  your own actions when you were a teen (outright rejecting stepmom and half sibling) were probably the result of similar muddled feelings (such as loyalty to your mother and resentment of her taking over your own parentified role). \n\nI hope both of you are able to keep talking openly, and I hope you rebuild your relationship.  Good luck!!", "NAH. \n\nShe's not a child anymore and you shared your thoughts and feelings on what happened in what sounds like a very reasonable way. \n\nEqually, she's not at fault for feeling this is a lot to take on (although I'm amazed she's never thought along these lines herself about why you might not be present?)\n\nBlaming you is uncalled for as her feelings are her responsibility but I see why she went there as she's immature.", "NTA at all, and I'm sorry that your grief at losing your mother wasn't handled sympathetically by the adults in your life at that time. How insensitive of your Dad to be angry with you for not wanting to be adopted by a lady you barely knew. He should have accepted your answer, no matter what it was, but instead he got mad you didn't just jump on board with the whole replacement mother thing. Badly done, OP's Dad.\u00a0\n\nYour sister, at 6ish years old, was in a very different place developmentally when your Dad remarried, and was more strongly programmed to make those parental connections. From a developmental perspective, at 15 you were increasing in independence and preparing to go it alone in the world, so gradually moving away from those childhood parental bonds. Your Dad expecting you to just slot in happily with his new family was tone-deaf at best, especially when you were grieving AND dealing with all the fun of teenage.\n\nAs for whether or not you should have told your sister the truth - she is 19, not 9. While perhaps not fully emotionally mature, I think she is beyond the point where she needs to be sheltered from the truth, or worse , lied to. Plus, she asked for the information. To be completely blunt, her feelings are not your responsibility. You weren't cruel, just truthful. You didn't ask your brothers to follow you, and to be honest I think it speaks volumes that they did. Once they reached adulthood they were free to choose, and they did. That's not on you. Nor is the fact that your Dad actively stopped you from seeing her - bet he never told her that...\n\nIt's sad your sister is hurting, but I think her blame is grossly misplaced. She should be looking to the adults in the situation back then, because I think it sounds like they handled your Mum's death and the creation of a new family unit very poorly indeed.\n\nPerhaps you and your sis could look into relationship therapy together if she's open to that? She clearly loves you too, or she wouldn't be so upset. Maybe she is directing her blame at you because she sees you more as a mother figure than a sister, and she felt abandoned when you left? Not saying that's what you did, just that may be how she felt.\n\nI hope you continue to heal, and that you and your sister can mend your relationship.", "NAH. It's a sad situation, but simply one where everyone wanted different things. Nobody was wrong for wanting them or getting upset that they couldn't have them, but that doesn't make everything okay. I've not been in this situation but I imagine give it a bit of time for your sister to process before contacting again (a week at most) and then acknowledge that what you did was hurtful for her, but the situation was also bad for you. Don't make it just about you and that you understand why it was a problem.", "NTA it's a lot for your sister to take in. With time she may come to accept and understand your position.", "It wasn't my dad's wife comparing us. My sister compared dad's wife to me and how we did thing differently. She was used to me doing it and once I was gone, seems like she might have clung to that stuff because she didn't get to see me anymore.", "I think maybe it was less coddling and more she was hoping for a different answer? Expectations of what someone will say can lead to a struggle when the answer is something they did not think about or have their brains already set on.", "The adoption thing made me see red. I don't think I was ever as angry as when he expected a woman I had known for 8 months be my mom, and only 3 months into their marriage.", "She was kept out of the arguing. All she did know was I had moved and she maybe picked up that there was a sort of tension in the house but never would have been told why. She knows that we lost mom and she also knows I helped take care of her after mom died.", "I've done therapy on and off since I was 12. My school had a therapist I saw for a few years and once I graduated college I started to pay for another one. There was a lot to work through with the therapist I have now because the school therapist could only do so much really at the age I was and with me living with the circumstances I was at the time.", "exactly people saying she needs to grow up etc should also consider the fact that lil sis is a kid herself it'll take time but i think in future she'll come to understand OP better", "It wasn't just that. My dad asking after three months of marriage and my knowing his wife for 8 months for me to consider letting her adopt me was something that changed the course of our relationship. He and I had been close before. But things were not handled well by him and I was also grieving. Not that it's all his fault. I'm not sure I ever would have been as close to his youngest child as he wanted me to be and his wife never would have been a parent figure to me and maybe that would have come between us anyway. But it felt so disrespectful and cruel to bring up adoption when he did and to not expect we would say no to it. I know he even brought it up to my brothers after I moved out and blamed me for them saying no again.", "She didn't. I think maybe she expected to hear me say I resented her and that I hated taking care of her or something. To me it's clear she had an idea of the why already. The wrong idea. But that her brain had already told her x was what happened but instead it was y and now she's left to figure all that out.", "I am totally open to therapy with my sister. I am never going to close that door on us because I love her so much and I miss the special relationship we used to have.\n\nShe doesn't know that dad prevented us from seeing each other when I saw our brothers. It's just my assumption but she did bring up the fact I saw them but not her and how the four of us saw each other without her once I had moved out.", "oh i am so sorryyy\n\nyea that sounds reasonable i mean she never had a mom figure in her life so she must have felt that wayy\n\ni don't think its any bad of her to think that way she is a kid herself \n\nit just shows how much more she needed u but ofc not everything works the way we want you made the right decision for yourself and I am sure if you guys will communicate she'll come to understand you as well", "That's understandable. It really doesn't serve anyone well to ask a question with a template for how they expect the question to be answered. It's a hard lesson for her to learn, but you're not an AH for being honest with her.", "That is even worse! I thought its been maybe already about 2-3 years when he recommended it. But even after this timespan it would have been harsh. \nI can totally understand why you just wanted to leave and I am sure after some time she will too.", "I get that. Maybe you weren't quite ready at that age either?\nI think it's cool that you're taking it on with your current therapist! It sounds like it's working better now than when you were younger.", "Well that's another sign of her immaturity, that she'd fixed her mind on what the 'real' reasons were without speaking to you, so when you were honest you really rocked the foundations she's built a narrative on.", "I hope so but there might be too much harm done. It makes me sad because I always loved my little sister and had a special relationship with her before. That we are no longer close at all is something that hurts us both. But I will always be here for her if she wants to try still.", "it might seems that harms done thats cause she is just a child  yk 19 is too young and living in that family dynamic..... so i think she'll come around to understand your choices in future don't worry"]}
