At the time of her second marriage my younger sisters were 15, 13 and 12. I didn't live with them because I had already moved out and left the state for college. So I never felt all that close to my mom's husband. To me that's all he is. He's not my father figure, my second dad, he's not even someone I would consider close family because I would not keep him in my life if he and mom divorced (which almost happened a few years ago) or if my mom were to pass away. I see him rarely and talk to him hardly ever.\n\nMy sister's do not consider him their new dad either. They all refer to him as mom's husband like me and use his first name. I don't think any of them ever called him their stepdad.\n\nI think because of this, and because our mom is very traditional, when the older two got married, they asked me to fill in for dad walking them down the aisle and doing a special dance with them. Now my youngest sister, who recently got engaged, asked me, and my mom's husband called me up and told me he wanted me to talk her into asking him, either alongside me, or if she only wants one, for me to step aside. He told me he's been a father to all three and not one of them has thought of him, but he knows they love me and respect me and would listen to me if I told them to ask. He had hoped one would think of him without prompting and that did not happen.\n\nI told him I would not have that conversation and told him he should find a way to accept it.\n\nBut he did not leave it there. He called me back the next day, he sent me messages and after a few weeks of this, and him not listening to my no. I told him he was being entitled, that he is not our father and is not entitled to walk one of my sister's down the aisle over me. I told him THEY choose, not him. He told me I was being rude and should respect him enough to think about why he would be hurt and why he would ask me to do this, and that he has been married to my mom for more than 12 years now which entitles him to consider himself a father. We ended the call on a non too pleasant note and then my mom called to ask what happened and she told me she had no idea he was so hurt by it. She said he had really invested in the idea of being a dad to us and loved us and struggled with the fact he wasn't even considered a good enough stepdad to be asked. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671885590, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu91yt/aita_for_telling_my_moms_husband_hes_entitled_and/", "score": 362, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It must suck to be on his position of helping raise teenagers but not be on the same page as them as to how the relationship is.

It won\u2019t change how you and your sisters feel about him except in a negative way.", "Things like this happen in a lot of blended families.

You are absolutely right. Your sister decides, not him. I would have voted NAH, cause I can understand him. But the second call was too much.", "NTA. The wedding isn't about him and he needs to realise that. The bride chooses. And she want the closest thing she has to her father, which is you.", "NTA, you were practically grown by the time he married your Mom. Him insisting on being a Father figure when you don't consider him one is off putting. He needs to accept that and move on\n\nCongratulations on your sister's upcoming wedding!

He's been married to your mom for half of the youngest sister's life, and still doesn't seem to have acceptance. That sucks.", "NTA and good for you for shielding your younger sister and promptly saying no. It's just better it doesn't have to be an extended thing and pull more people in. I do feel for him a bit. He would've been around for at least 6 years of her growing up and likely does feel like a parental figure. However voicing this right before a wedding isn't the way.", "NTA. It's a dumb tradition to be honest, but just because he is the oldest male of the household with the corresponding genitals doesn't give him any automatic rights to it. \n\nNot only that, but he doesn't even respect her decision enough.", "NTA, you said all that needs to be said to him.  Even your mom was surprised how hurt he was, meaning she herself didn\u2019t think he would consider himself a father figure to all of you.", "Gonna go with NAH but I feel bad for step dad. While it's true that it's not his place or right to ask, it's sad that no one appreciates him. For him he probably sees you guys as family but for you guys you just see him as \"whatever his name is\"", "NTA you told him no many times and he didn\u2019t accept it. It\u2019s not your wedding and your sister asked you. I understand him being hurt by not being asked but he should also understand why the girls asked you.", "NTA Trying to one-sidedly force relationships to be closer never works out. If you and your sisters were at the point where you wanted him to do this he would have been asked to do it. What he is doing, and the attitude he is taking, is counter-productive.", "NTA and this isn't about him not being a \"good enough\" stepdad.  He's just not your father.  Weddings are an emotional occasion and particularly when you're navigating having lost a parent.  Besides it being a major life milestone, weddings are very parent/child heavy (the toasts, the dances, shopping for the dress, the planning, walking down the aisle of course and on and on).  I know all of this first hand because my mom died when I was young and my wedding was extremely bittersweet for me.  You are absolutely correct not to get in the middle and it IS your sister's choice.  If he has a problem he should talk to her himself.  If he wasn't an entitled jerk, they may consider another way to honor him as a stepfather.  But he shouldn't count on it and should focus on being a supportive guest.", "Your mom's husband's feelings are not more important than the wishes of the people getting married. It's not on you and your siblings to assuage his tantrums. NTA", "There's no definite answer, at least from my perspective. Your stepdad wants to feel like he belongs in the family and walking your sister down the aisle is one such event that would imprint on everybody, it might even help you all forge a bond that you've been lacking all these years. On the other hand, this is your sister's marriage and she should be the one to make the call. I sympathize with her choice and I'm glad I'm not in OP's shoes, because it's an impossible choice. I can't say how the family dynamic evolved when your dad died, or whose fault it is. Maybe the dad was too introverted and scared to approach and bond with you the right way? Or maybe he wasn't interested, hard to say. It's sad to see this happening in families where no one thinks of the consequences of their inaction 10, 20 years from today. I would talk with your sister about this, as openly as possible and see if it's possible to maintain her wishes while allowing the stepdad some part in the ceremony too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

From the post, it is difficult to tell why he has not been able to form any relationship with his wife's children, and I feel badly for him but I agree that the bride gets the sole say over who walks her down the aisle.

That is understandable, and I feel bad too.  However, the step dad is absolutely wrong to try to guilt op into having that conversation with his sister when she has already expressed her wishes.", "Yeah this is my sentiment too.

Unless we\u2019re missing details there\u2019s no reason to believe he didn\u2019t step into the stepfather role, particularly for OPs younger siblings.
