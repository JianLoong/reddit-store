At the time of her second marriage my younger sisters were 15, 13 and 12. I didn't live with them because I had already moved out and left the state for college. So I never felt all that close to my mom's husband. To me that's all he is. He's not my father figure, my second dad, he's not even someone I would consider close family because I would not keep him in my life if he and mom divorced (which almost happened a few years ago) or if my mom were to pass away. I see him rarely and talk to him hardly ever.\n\nMy sister's do not consider him their new dad either. They all refer to him as mom's husband like me and use his first name. I don't think any of them ever called him their stepdad.\n\nI think because of this, and because our mom is very traditional, when the older two got married, they asked me to fill in for dad walking them down the aisle and doing a special dance with them. Now my youngest sister, who recently got engaged, asked me, and my mom's husband called me up and told me he wanted me to talk her into asking him, either alongside me, or if she only wants one, for me to step aside. He told me he's been a father to all three and not one of them has thought of him, but he knows they love me and respect me and would listen to me if I told them to ask. He had hoped one would think of him without prompting and that did not happen.\n\nI told him I would not have that conversation and told him he should find a way to accept it.\n\nBut he did not leave it there. He called me back the next day, he sent me messages and after a few weeks of this, and him not listening to my no. I told him he was being entitled, that he is not our father and is not entitled to walk one of my sister's down the aisle over me. I told him THEY choose, not him. He told me I was being rude and should respect him enough to think about why he would be hurt and why he would ask me to do this, and that he has been married to my mom for more than 12 years now which entitles him to consider himself a father. We ended the call on a non too pleasant note and then my mom called to ask what happened and she told me she had no idea he was so hurt by it. She said he had really invested in the idea of being a dad to us and loved us and struggled with the fact he wasn't even considered a good enough stepdad to be asked. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671885590, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu91yt/aita_for_telling_my_moms_husband_hes_entitled_and/", "score": 1387, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know all of this first hand because my mom died when I was young and my wedding was extremely bittersweet for me.  You are absolutely correct not to get in the middle and it IS your sister's choice.  If he has a problem he should talk to her himself.

On the other hand, this is your sister's marriage and she should be the one to make the call. I sympathize with her choice and I'm glad I'm not in OP's shoes, because it's an impossible choice. I can't say how the family dynamic evolved when your dad died, or whose fault it is. Maybe the dad was too introverted and scared to approach and bond with you the right way? Or maybe he wasn't interested, hard to say. It's sad to see this happening in families where no one thinks of the consequences of their inaction 10, 20 years from today.

If not, then why would any of them consider him for \"father of the bride\" duties? If so, would it be possible that any of them didn't consider him in order to not offend the other siblings? (Not saying that is the case at all, but I remember my sibling worrying about my reaction to him calling my stepmom \"mom\".)\n\nPerhaps just ask your sister what she really wants, no judgement. Make sure that there is no concern that you and your other sisters would judge her if that is what she wants. If she wants you, then that's what she wants.\n\nNTA for not trying to pressure her to your mom's husband's desire to be fob.

The fact none of them did and these actions tells me he tried to Force the parental role on them and his statement about being \"entitled\" just because he was there proves pretty thoroughly he isn't Deserving of it.", "NTA. It says something about how he was as a stepdad when none of his stepkids like him.", "NTA, It's your sister's choice, and it's not your job to talk her into something else.  Your step\\[father has been very entitled and inappropriate in pressuring you over the phone, but hopefully this is an abberation in his otherwise good behavior.  But I do think that if he's been a good stepfather, and has been kind and supportive of your sister, respectful of the memory of your father, and a decent person, it would be nice if she could find a way to pay her respects to him, even in a minor way, in the wedding or reception.  (Not if it creeps her out, of course.)", "ES(afe)H. \n\nYou did the right thing (not sure about the delivery) to tell him \u2018no.\u2019 I don\u2019t think he did anything that would deserve getting verbally hurt. \n\nI kind of feel for the guy.

Asking OP to try and push for them to change their wedding.  Note how the plan isn't Ask about it himself but instead to manipulate with an end run using someone else as a scapegoat for the inevitable fight.  Followed by \"I'm Entitled to consider myself a father because I married your mom\".  \n\nI don't know if he respected them then but he sure as hell doesn't now.", "NTA it\u2019s her wedding and she wants you to walk her down the aisle like her sisters before her don\u2019t ruin her wedding just because you want to consider your step dad\u2019s ego", "So his feelings are more important than the person getting married? Even to the degree where you're asked to manipulate or at least persuade them into going against their own wishes. If you stepped down when agreeing to the others you'd be playing a dangerous game where you'd possibly damage the relationship to your sister.\nHow about he makes an effort and tells her he'd be happy to attend, and if there is a role for him he'd happily take it. He could even ask for another special dance. But that conversation is between the two. \n\nNTA.", "NTA your sister chose you, he\u2019s disrespectful to go against her wishes and say he plans to talk her into asking him. It doesn\u2019t matter what he feels and it\u2019s not you and your siblings job to regulate your behaviour and dreams to accommodate his feelings of happiness. That is not good parenting so even in this he shows a how he\u2019s failed to form a good bond", "you. are. my. hero. well done.", "he\u2019s not owed acceptance", "yes! this! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "But the thing is, somebody trying to act like a parent doesn't make them a parent. It's ultimately down to how the kids feel. It doesn't mean he's a bad stepdad or a bad person, and he's allowed to be hurt, but he's an asshole for badgering OP (and if he expected to be considered a dad despite it being clear how the kids feel).", "And it's also not OPs job to speak for the stepdad. If the stepdad really wants the sister to reconsider, he needs to have a conversation with *her* and be prepared for whatever the consequences of that conversation are.", "I agree bio parent or not if they suck as a parent/person cut them and when they die spit on their grave/s", "NTA. You are honoring your sisters\u2019 wishes. If they wanted him, they would have asked him.", "NTA, he called you up to make arrangements for your sister's wedding. You are not the groom. The fact that he's trying to talk to you, to make decisions for your sister's wedding is already where he has crossed the line.\n\nHe is not owed anything from you or your siblings, he does not own you.

He's not owed a relationship with them", "i don\u2019t understand why anyone views mom\u2019s husband as the victim here. he is not entitled to anything. his step children are not responsible for his emotions or emotional well being, or to fulfill his dream of being a father. anyone who cannot respect a no is a huge red flag for me.", "\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "The kids were too old for him to swoop in as new dad, especially after their father died. I don\u2019t feel bad for him, as he should have managed these expectations long ago. I\u2019m guessing this is partly why they feel distance, because he has likely been pushing a dad narrative that he wanted to an audience that needed a support system, not a new dad. That thought is painful to mourning children, an adult being a friend and support is not.  \n\nIt sounds like he thought this would happen because he wanted it and didn\u2019t follow the kid\u2019s lead. I\u2019m assuming this due to his behavior now, wanting to be seen publicly as dad without having developed a base relationship of support and care without pressure. \n\nSimply put, his feeling of entitlement to the spot is exactly why he doesn\u2019t have it.", "No, he's not. Still sucks to not have it.", "Seriously, not only is he saying that he feels entitled to their emotions and the honors of being a father, he's actively going out of his way to disrespect the bride and get someone on his side to pressure her to get what he wants out of her wedding. He's not a victim", "Right bc my mother's husband isn't the same as my (beloved?) stepfather.\n\nAlso demanding positions of honor takes the honor out of them.\n\nThis really is all a manipulation by SF to garner praise and attention as some kind of sainted step parent at your sister's expense.\n\nHr just doesn't have any right to that, let alone the parenting capital to demand it.\n\nIf he thinks he's SO correct, then he should ask your sister himself. \n\nBut he won't because he's a coward and a bully and he already knows what her answer will be.\n\nGood job standing up for your sister!", "Honestly though, marrying a widow with kids doesn't entitle you to become a father.  He's not entitled to prizes or honors for entering into a relationship with a woman", "Or that he cast himself in his own story about how great he was for marrying a woman w 3 teenagers at home.\n\nThe daughters are each and all having a different experience than what Bob has told himself.", "also sucks he\u2019s putting his emotional needs first. real quality dad material.", "Your ideas for making things 'fair' are fair AND, NO if Bob thinks he is so correct that he should be walking the bride down the aisle then he can be a grown up, use his words and ask The Bride.\n\nNeither OP nor the bride owe him any consideration. \n\nHe is their mother's husband. Maybe he should focus on being good at that.\n\nOP and siblings didn't pick him.

Ultimately we don't know if he is a bad guy or not and you can feel free to think he is in the wrong for trying to push OP and the sister.\n\nPay attention to what OP says at the very end when the mom says he just wanted to be dad. OP has always been distant so there is no relationship between the two, but step dad may have bonded with the sisters. Again all he wants to do is be dad. The sisters got/are getting married and he has always wanted a part in it as any father would.\n\nOP and the sisters are making a point that step dad isn't real dad no matter how much he wants to be. All of step dad's efforts into bonding with the family mean nothing. He will never really be dad. That's what makes it sad. \n\nI am in no way typing this in an effort to suggest that OP or the sister are bad people or wrong, but I think it's sad to see a man who wanted to be more with people he sees as family not be the sorta figure he wanted to be for them.", "NTA.
