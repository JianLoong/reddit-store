Recently, he proposed to me and I said yes. Our newborn baby girl was born at the end of June, just a week after said engagement.\n\nThis morning, I noticed that he posted a picture of his second child from a previous relationship on Facebook. This is normal and nothing of concern, obviously. However, it occurred to me that he has not acknowledged his new child or engagement online whatsoever. I\u2019ve acknowledged both my engagement and new baby on Facebook which received much praise and congratulations. I was not expecting him to post in regards to our engagement because he\u2019s a rather private person, but it definitely hurt my feelings to see that he continuously acknowledges and posts pictures of his other children (he has 2 from 2 previous relationships) but has not done the same for our child. I pointed this out and he told me that it was because he was a private person, but he\u2019s definitely posted about previous people he\u2019s been with, including their shared children. I have not been acknowledged publicly at all in our relationship, and only immediate family members and close friends know about me. And before anyone says it, I am not so much upset about me/our engagement not being posted about because I\u2019ve never questioned where I stand with him and I\u2019ve never felt a need to compete or seek public validation. I feel more disappointed that our child, the child given to him by the only woman he\u2019s asked for her hand in marriage, didn\u2019t make the cut for being post-worthy. Because of this, I\u2019ve taken off my ring and told him that if our child is a secret, so is our engagement. He argued that it\u2019s not the same thing and I told him a ring is public and symbolic acknowledgment of our relationship, and that even without it, we are still engaged just like we still have a baby even if he refuses to tell the world about her the way you he does with his other children. I told him if he doesn\u2019t have to acknowledge me as his fianc\u00e9 or his newborn child, I don\u2019t have to wear a ring that lets the world know I\u2019m in a committed relationship, for my privacy. I don\u2019t like the idea of being a secret fianc\u00e9 or having my child be a secret from his friends and family. I strongly believes my child deserves the same adoration and acknowledgement as any of our other children.

She's wondering why he isn't telling all his friends and family about their engagement and child. \n\nIt's absolutely right to question if that person is hiding you and if so from what. It's also absolutely not true that showing love and care in the real world makes it completely fine. Plenty of people have had a second family, cheat and keep it all hidden. She has a right to know why it seems like he's hiding them if they are supposed to be getting married."]}
