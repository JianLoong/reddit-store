Recently, he proposed to me and I said yes. Our newborn baby girl was born at the end of June, just a week after said engagement.\n\nThis morning, I noticed that he posted a picture of his second child from a previous relationship on Facebook. This is normal and nothing of concern, obviously. However, it occurred to me that he has not acknowledged his new child or engagement online whatsoever. I\u2019ve acknowledged both my engagement and new baby on Facebook which received much praise and congratulations. I was not expecting him to post in regards to our engagement because he\u2019s a rather private person, but it definitely hurt my feelings to see that he continuously acknowledges and posts pictures of his other children (he has 2 from 2 previous relationships) but has not done the same for our child. I pointed this out and he told me that it was because he was a private person, but he\u2019s definitely posted about previous people he\u2019s been with, including their shared children. I have not been acknowledged publicly at all in our relationship, and only immediate family members and close friends know about me. And before anyone says it, I am not so much upset about me/our engagement not being posted about because I\u2019ve never questioned where I stand with him and I\u2019ve never felt a need to compete or seek public validation. I feel more disappointed that our child, the child given to him by the only woman he\u2019s asked for her hand in marriage, didn\u2019t make the cut for being post-worthy. Because of this, I\u2019ve taken off my ring and told him that if our child is a secret, so is our engagement. He argued that it\u2019s not the same thing and I told him a ring is public and symbolic acknowledgment of our relationship, and that even without it, we are still engaged just like we still have a baby even if he refuses to tell the world about her the way you he does with his other children. I told him if he doesn\u2019t have to acknowledge me as his fianc\u00e9 or his newborn child, I don\u2019t have to wear a ring that lets the world know I\u2019m in a committed relationship, for my privacy.

I totally get the privacy thing; however, you've stated that he posts about his exes and his children by them. So, he's not so private after all, which makes this a red flag. You've been together long enough to have a baby, and he cares enough about you to ask you to marry him, but no one outside his immediate family or closest friends knows about you, your engagement, or your baby. Is he ashamed? Does he see you as a symbol of personal failure? Does he fear ridicule and judgement when he announces a third woman and a third child?\n\nConsidering the situation, putting the engagement \u2013 not just hiding the ring \u2013 on hold might be advisable. If, as you've said, your relationship is good and you get along well, then hopefully, you can talk through whatever shame block he has around you and the baby and work to get past it.

Sounds like your current partner has people in his life he would rather not know about you, that may be a previous partner or just people in his life in general.\nBeing private in of itself is not a bad thing, you don\u2019t need to publish your whole life on social media but the disconnect in how he treats you and your child vs his other children is concerning. I would explain your concerns and get his reasoning. Try not to escalate the situation and come to an agreement if you can\u2019t do it now you have no hope of collectively raising a child together", "NTA. It\u2019s not unreasonable for you to want to be acknowledged in such a joyous time, and if there\u2019s no trace of you on his socials then I\u2019d be concerned that it\u2019s not privacy he\u2019s after, but secrecy. It\u2019s one thing to decide as a couple to keep it to yourself, but if you\u2019ve told all of your followers about it then that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. I\u2019m worried for you not just because the postpartum period brings a lot of emotion, but also because I\u2019ve unknowingly been the other woman with a guy who lived with and was trying to conceive a child with his girlfriend; he was all over her socials and she wasn\u2019t anywhere on his and I didn\u2019t know she existed.", "Sounds like this guy has more than one family.", "My last bf was the same, no publicity about our engagement,  we were seeing each other after we broke up and he told no one.

I think there's something sneaky going on here. There's no reason for him to hide you and your child, unless he's not over a past relationship.
