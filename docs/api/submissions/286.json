It's the biggest I've ever been in my life. I used to struggle with an eating disorder (my dad doesn't know about this, he doesn't believe in mental illness so there's no point in telling him, I have diagnosed mental illnesses that I take meds for and he shames me and says I should stop taking them) and was about 20 pounds underweight. He'd always tell me to gain weight. After the pandemic and switching from a physical labour job to a wfh office job, I've gained some weight.\n\nI feel like shit about it and I am trying to actively lose it. I joined kickboxing classes and I am cooking. I am working on it. Everytime my dad sees me, he comments on it, saying things like \"even pretty girls get fat\" and talking about how awful I look and how much harder it'll be to lose the weight. I've told him I'm working on it and to please stop commenting on it, but he refuses to stop and KEEPS incessantly telling me the same things. \n\nLast night, I was having a great night, and then he decided to send a photo of me when I was underweight and tell me that I need to work hard to lose weight and that I should start fasting. He said he was a bad influence for feeding me when I'd visit. He says it's what a good parent would do and that I should take it positively, but I'm relapsing. I tried to get yogurt this morning and I sobbed, I couldn't get it in my mouth.\n\nI'm scared to visit for Thanksgiving and Christmas and to be told constantly how fat I am. I can't take it, especially when I am already putting the work in. When he says things like this, I get so depressed I don't want to even leave the house.

Older mama Redditor here. What a lousy hand you got dealt with your so-called \u201cdad\u201d.

Keep him blocked everywhere. His sending you that photo makes me so, so angry. I want that to never happen to you again. No email, apps, texting, calls. He\u2019s poisonous. If your mother hasn\u2019t been able to shut him up and insist that he stops verbally abusing you, it\u2019s time to separate from her as well.

It\u2019s normal to eat when you are hungry. You deserve to be loved. You need a caring guide on the road to finally loving yourself.

You have every right to cut them off - to survive, you really need to do so. If you want to send an e-card or even flowers for your mum\u2019s bday, fine, but be firm about no contact with dad and extremely limited contact with your mother - contact only when you choose it. I saw in one of your responses that you see a therapist? I hope you are telling them EVERYTHING, do not hold back info out of shame or fear. Get all the support you possibly can. You have done nothing wrong. Some folks get stuck having to parent themselves quite a bit, and I think that\u2019s where you are. You are worth saving, worth loving. Please, be kind to yourself.", "Yes, I am working really hard to be open with my therapist, I adore her. Growing up, I was in family therapy a lot and the therapists always believed my parents saying I was lying about everything. CPS came multiple times but did nothing. Now I have a therapist that actually believes me and cares. It means so much. Thank you very much for your response.", "Congratulations - it is so important to have the right therapist.  Show her this Reddit thread.  I think she\u2019d want to see it.  As a mother myself, I wish I could hug you or comfort you in some way.  \u201cHellocloudshellosky\u201d is spot on - please protect yourself from your abusers."]}
