I obliged to avoid having problems with my neighbors.\n\nMonths ago, I decided that I was lacking self-love. I'm successful and own a business, but I realized I've given her a lot of my tine in exchange for rude criticism, being made fun of and lack of support for my goals. \n\nSo, I started buying nicer clothes and taking care of my skin. A new hairstyle and color did wonders for my self-esteem. The minute she saw me, she started laughing hysterically. She did the same when I bought new sneakers. Please keep in mind that I hadn't bought anything for myself I think in more than 2 years and hadn't been to the salon since the pandemic. I've been working on a business deal that thankfully came through with an initial payment stretched over 12 months that's really life changing.  I'm very thankful and grateful that I could bless those who truly care about me. I helped my elderly neighbor move back with her daughter. They are such wonderful people and money constraints kept them from seeing each other. My neighbor is 82F and very lonely and her daughter calls all the time. They don't know much about logistics, so I helped out with phone calls and other arrangements. I covered her pet transportation and part of her plane ticket which is no big deal at this moment. After I was done, Nilda gave me a lecture and said I was a moron for making someone else's shit my problem. That was on New Year's Eve, a time when I'm especially nostalgic and sensitive. I ended up avoiding her and feeling much better. I was so angry that I moved while she was at work on purpose. \n\nNilda found out after a week and her reaction was weird and scary.

She's the one that was trying to push you down, to make herself feel better, with **her mocking and dismissiveness, with her lack of support and the way she undermined you.**  \n\n**Your instincts told you to hide the move** from her, and get safely away before she found out.  You followed that instinct, which was wise of you.  **You didn't do wrong to do this**, because she's not a person that has treated you well.  \n\n**When you can't trust someone, why would you include them** in the big events of your life?  When you can't trust someone to support and encourage you in your life, why would you want them there during a big event?  Moving is stressful.  Nilda is stressful.  **She wouldn't have helped lower your stress, she would have made it worse.**  \n\n**With some people, the way to protect yourself and get through stressful times, is to make sure that they don't about your plans until you have already gotten through** the event.  Nilda showed you, by her reaction, that she would use your choice to focus on herself, not on you.  \n\nI think if you had told her, she would have been emotionally draining to you as you packed and moved, and would have over and over made it all about her and her wants.   I think she would have ignored your needs, and tried to sabotage your move, if she could.  I think she would have done much to make you feel guilty.  I think she would have thrown tantrums and pity parties and whined and complained about how she was sad, she wasn't being thought of, etc.  She would have hurt you and drained you emotionally, during a time when you were already stressed just getting things done.  \n\n**This is not your fault.**  People drop her friendship because of her behavior, not because they are at fault.  **They aren't \"abandoning her\", they are protecting themselves from the way she treats others.**   Now that you are far from her, maybe it's time to block her, yourself.
