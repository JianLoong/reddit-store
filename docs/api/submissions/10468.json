They are such wonderful people and money constraints kept them from seeing each other. My neighbor is 82F and very lonely and her daughter calls all the time. They don't know much about logistics, so I helped out with phone calls and other arrangements. I covered her pet transportation and part of her plane ticket which is no big deal at this moment. After I was done, Nilda gave me a lecture and said I was a moron for making someone else's shit my problem. That was on New Year's Eve, a time when I'm especially nostalgic and sensitive.

I would have been better to tell her I moved out right away instead of what I did. She has a history of people walking out/dumping her/ running away from her and she currently has no friends. I'm not saying I should have stayed, but maybe not leave like that.
