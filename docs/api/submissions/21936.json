I\u2019ve never had a great relationship with my SIL (36F) or the rest of their family. I\u2019m always polite & bite my tongue but the majority of the family with exception of my wife are very controlling & selfish. We live in Scotland where I\u2019m from but they come from the US and so the majority of the family is over there. I\u2019m aware that they both endured an abusive childhood so have a very close bond but my SIL has a huge emotional dependency on my wife as her husband is very passive and doesn\u2019t help with anything like that - he just says \u201ccall your sister\u201d if anything upsets her. \n\nAnyway, my wife just visited the US due to one of her uncles having health issues and wants to go back to visit with me as we haven\u2019t before due to the pandemic. \n\nMy wife brought this up in front of my SIL who invited her family - husband & three kids - along with us. She completely took over and started talking about us all sharing a house because it would be cheaper, getting a 7 seater car to fit us all, etc. \n\nMy wife did step in briefly to say we\u2019d probably get our own car but SIL took offence to this immediately as she has a tendency to do. \n\nWe got home and I told my wife I wouldn\u2019t mind going at the same time but I want to set boundaries, namely;\n1. Not sharing accommodation - would be happy staying in the same hotel but not a house share. \n2. Having our own transport. \n3.

You'll be a nice man to entertain her lump of a husband while she yacks your wife's head off and bosses everyone around.\n\nWell she can just keep wanting that.\n\nIt's YOUR (very expensive) overseas vacation as newly marrieds. This is a perfect time to set the \"house rules\" going forward.\n\n**Your wife** needs to\n\n* get on the same page with you, so you both need to talk it out until there's a perfectly agreed plan, and then\n* deploy it, on her sister.\n\n*\"So Sis, since this is Roddy's first time in the US with me, we'll be mostly doing our own thing. We'll handle our own car rental and our own accommodations. Let's pick a couple nights where we'll do family suppers, and the rest of the time, I'll be showing him around.\"*\n\nAnd if Sis just absolutely cannot handle that, then your wife needs to pull out the big guns:\n\n*\"Oh dear, we really have opposite expectations here. You know what, never mind\"* and back the heck out of that \"vacation\" before the UN has to send peacekeepers.\n\nNTA, hold your ground, but it's up to your wife to deliver the terms. \n\nOption B: wife can go with them, on her own. You \"have to work\" ;-)", "I had to think about this for a second but NTA\n\nYou will want time to rest, having someone else\u2019s family in the same space will wreck that. You will want space as a couple, time for your own relationship beyond the family dynamic. I think that\u2019s pretty reasonable. You also are not free childcare which unfortunately can become expected on trips like this.\n\nStaying in a similar area/accommodation type might be good, close but not stacked on top of each other. If she took offence at renting different cars, she may also be hoping that you will split the costs, which once again is not your job.", "YTA for even considering letting SIL invite herself along.  My in-laws are like that, they take over even if you set boundaries and there is no way to block them.  There is no way in hell I would ever vacation with my in-laws.  Tell your wife it is your vacation too and it if SIL is there, you aren't going with no negotiations.  Have a plan for if SIL just shows up.  \n\nMy wife planned a vacation with in-laws, I told her to have a good time and dropped her at the airport.", "NTA", "NTA. Much better to negotiate workable boundaries now than to spend the trip being resentful and frustrated. If your SIL can\u2019t cope with the idea of separate *cars* \\- which makes good sense in any scenario, because it gives the party flexibility to do different things occasionally, if desired - then the reason you need space is VERY obvious.", "NTA. Nothing ruins a vacation faster than an aggressive relative commandeering it and turning into THEIR vacation.  Your SIL has some strong 'apron strings' attached to your wife, and has not 'released' her yet; she also seems to put her OWN 'wants and needs' above everyone else's - something that should be pointed out to her when she starts taking over. Your SIL would probably take it best if your wife was the main one to PUSH back, and you were the one BACKING up your wife.  If you were the main one/only one pushing back, it might trigger a lot of protective/defensive processes in your SIL. It is also key that your wife NOT throw you under the bus, you are not to 'blame', it is your SIL that is  asking too much, not you. Everyone deserves their own space and privacy in accommodations; and car-sharing between families while at a destination is NEVER a good plan.", "If you go, you will be miserable. There is no way your wife will resist the raging control of SIL.\n\nTherefore:\n\nLet your wife go if she wants. You stay home.\n\nDo not even attempt to set boundaries and go on this trip, because SIL will dierfather than let you defy her. It will be war.\n\nJust don't go and the problem is solved. You wife won't like it, because then she'll have to bear all the mishigoss alone, but she deserves to since she refuses to defend herself from attack. She could stay home with you, but she's terrified of her sister. What way is that to live? Bullies have power only if you give them power.\n\nShe'll say to you, I have to, it's family.\n\nBut she doesn't have to. And \"family\" is just a word. \n\nNTA", "NTA I would have these same boundaries. In no way will I ever stay in the same house as my in-laws and I grew up with them as my neighbors.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
