You could read up on adhd and see what tricks and tips might help keep their little minds calmer. I'm betting a lot of their 'behavioral issues' are simply out of frustration, quite possibly towards themselves.  \nLook into sensory issues, work on their level, keeping them occupied and engaged in other ways, don't expect them to fit your mold. Because their brains literally work differently from yours. Simply making rules often doesn't work or has a reverse effect. Looking for causes of behavior can lead you to (unexpected) solutions.  \n\n\nBasically, if you want this to work, you're gonna have to suck it up and take care of these kids too. And not just this one week, but for the next 4 to 11 years at least.

If he wants to travel during his custody time, it's HIS RESPONSIBILITY to plan for his children. He could work out some flexibility with the other parent(s) of his children. He could arrange for a family member or paid caretaker to supervise and support his children in his absence. Instead, he relied on his own sexist and controlling assumption that your time and resources are his to use as he sees fit, and you have no right to boundaries or opinions that might restrict his \"right\" to define your \"duties.\"\n\nCustody time is to continue and grow the parent-child relationship. His CHOOSING to leave during his custody time tells me he sees his children as a burden to be managed, primarily by shifting his responsibilities onto a woman.

You will become step mum in time but right now I personally think it\u2019s too soon.

You are not the parent. I have seen where Bio Moms won't and don't allow a step-parent to watch the children if the bio parent is going to be gone for a long period of time.

Lots of pain and potential risk - but not likely to die or lose the arm before contact with the legal guardian can be made. Not fair to the kid to make them sit in agony while they hope the parents can be contacted. It's why most schools, daycares, camps etc all have disclaimers that parents have to sign allowing the adult in charge to seek medical care for the child.", "Honestly, I would bet there is a \u201cright of first refusal\u201d written into the childcare plan which means he is supposed to let her know if he won\u2019t be with them, so that she has first option to choose to have them stay with her. It\u2019s extremely standard language in custody agreements.", "He hasn't even cleared it with her? Holy shit that's spectacular. And if those kids don't have full respect for you, you're in for a nightmare ride. NTA", "Honestly I don\u2019t know of a custody agreement that is cool with a father leaving the kids with a non-family member without permission/notification.

You shouldn't be having to learn ways to cope to handle children that aren't yours. I'd caution you to carefully evaluate what kind of a person this guy is -- the idea of leaving my children with someone I'm dating who isn't their biological parent is beyond irresponsible and a safety risk. Huge red flags all around, for multiple reasons that are entirely unrelated to your ability to care for the kids.", "You probably don't even have the legal rights to parent his kids. What will you do if one of them needs to see a doctor?\n\nThey need to be with their mom for the entire time your bf is away.", "I personally think this is abusive behavior, OP.

Sounds like it is expected and you don\u2019t have a choice to me regardless of your valid discomfort.

What does she get it if it? 1/4 of your attention? Do you need his money? Cannot you not survive on your own?

You need to up your expectations", "Uff, bad move. \n\nYou are not their mother and their mother is very obviously in their lives so they are not \"our kids\", they are very much their kids.

Things need to be made clear beforehand and tested through vacations together or whatever.\n\nBe very clear that you will not be responsible for them while he is away.

I\u2019m going to hazard a guess that he saw this as an way to have someone there to watch his kids so he could go off and do other things.

What exactly are you getting out of this relationship? Also, where is the mother of his children? If they split custody, why isn\u2019t she keeping their kids while he\u2019s away? How does she feel about you taking care of their children solo? How long were you together before he introduced you to them? Lastly, please don\u2019t let him make you feel toxic for referring to them as \u201chis\u201d because that\u2019s exactly what they are; HIS KIDS. It really sounds like he using you as a bangmaid & a baby-sitter. You\u2019re NTA but you will be if you allow this situation to continue. You may want to consider finding another place for you & your daughter, even if it\u2019s temporarily with family or a friend.

Then use the time he\u2019s gone to move out.", "Do you have employment and if so do you contribute to the household finances?  Do you get child support from your ex or does your BF support her?  How long were he and his ex divorced when you started dating him? There are a LOT of red flags here.  Obviously, the age difference, but he VOLUNTEERED for this assignment-- was there a HUGE financial bonus for this and would YOU personally benefit from the additional money or would it be \"his\" money?-- without ASKING you if that would be workable.  Calling you toxic when it's actually his behavior that's toxic.  \n\nDo you have money saved that's just yours?  Do you have friends or family that would take you in for a while?", "You have to ask yourself if this relationship is worth this living situation.  It doesn't sound good for you OR your child.  It is beyond disrespectful for him not to ask you and to volunteer.  You have agency here - if you stay, this is what you are signing up for.  It's up to you to decide the life you and your child will have for the next 10-20 years.  If this is the life you chose, remember, it was your choice.", "And does he own the house? Do you pay rent and contribute to the bills? \n\nBecause you know, if you and your child were living in his house rent free I might judge differently than say if its was rented and you split the rent and bills.", "No, my verdict is how I want to vote.", "This is so true. I once dated someone that did this shit to me (expecting me to watch his child without asking first, shirked responsibilities for his child and expected me to pick up the slack) and he would blow up when I referred to his kid as \u201chis kid\u201d.
