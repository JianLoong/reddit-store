Especially when they have adhd as you say. That makes it extremely exhausting for them too. And they're little and have extra struggle with adjusting to these changes. You could read up on adhd and see what tricks and tips might help keep their little minds calmer. I'm betting a lot of their 'behavioral issues' are simply out of frustration, quite possibly towards themselves.  \nLook into sensory issues, work on their level, keeping them occupied and engaged in other ways, don't expect them to fit your mold. Because their brains literally work differently from yours. Simply making rules often doesn't work or has a reverse effect. Looking for causes of behavior can lead you to (unexpected) solutions.  \n\n\nBasically, if you want this to work, you're gonna have to suck it up and take care of these kids too. And not just this one week, but for the next 4 to 11 years at least.

If he wants to travel during his custody time, it's HIS RESPONSIBILITY to plan for his children. He could work out some flexibility with the other parent(s) of his children.

Instead, he relied on his own sexist and controlling assumption that your time and resources are his to use as he sees fit, and you have no right to boundaries or opinions that might restrict his \"right\" to define your \"duties.\"\n\nCustody time is to continue and grow the parent-child relationship. His CHOOSING to leave during his custody time tells me he sees his children as a burden to be managed, primarily by shifting his responsibilities onto a woman.

You will become step mum in time but right now I personally think it\u2019s too soon.

You are not the parent. I have seen where Bio Moms won't and don't allow a step-parent to watch the children if the bio parent is going to be gone for a long period of time.

Also sorry your parents never taught you that they\u2019re allowed to have friends over and entertain other adults with spending 100% of that time on you. \n\nI didn\u2019t meet her until months after we\u2019d started dating and that was only because they had a family emergency and needed a sitter. They trusted me to stay with her for a few hours because I\u2019m a nanny specifically for her age group. Realistically I saw her a handful of times after that. FFS I was dating her parents I didn\u2019t just go over to their house 24/7. \n\nI really enjoyed being with them and we were together for a significant chunk of time. It was a serious relationship. Ultimately I decided to break it off after spending a few nights over- I already knew their kid was snotty with poor boundaries but I didn\u2019t know the extent until she was *still* awake with us at 11pm and I was asleep on my feet. They cracked jokes about how she only ever wanted to sleep with them when I was over and how she liked hanging out with me more than their ex whom she knew since birth. They don\u2019t host parties as much anymore bc she throws tantrums when the attention isn\u2019t 100% on her. These were things I learned gradually. \n\nI wasn\u2019t a fucking fuck buddy unicorn and I\u2019m so goddamn sick of people talking about this like we were being sexually inappropriate around a child.

Where I live, a parent has the right to choose their childcare during their parenting time. Unless there IS a right of first refusal in place, there wouldn't be a basis for the kids' mom to fight over it. Even with a right of first refusal, there is common law that allows ROFR to be sidestepped if the children are in the care of a parent's new partner because it is viewed as supporting that relationship and integrating the children into the new dynamics of the household.\n\nIt's perhaps a bit murkier when that parent is not married to the new partner, but depending on the relationship dynamics it could still be viewed as falling within that scope (e.g., unmarried but living together, sharing expenses, etc.).", "This is my biggest issue with this. I had a coworker that insisted on moving in (and eventually marrying) a man with children that had a lot of behavioral issues.

People read things like this and waste everyone's time and money with a losing court battle. This would NOT be a basis for a change in custody where I live absent other extenuating factors - I know, because I am a divorce attorney and have had to deal with both sides of this kind of fight. There is case law that entitles a parent to have their new partner care for the children during their scheduled parenting time, even when a right of first refusal is in place, because to allow otherwise would infringe on that parent's constitutional rights. There is case law that a parent has the right to determine the childcare they use during their parenting time - e.g., unless there is a court order otherwise (or it is an unreasonable choice, like putting the kid in a $10,000 per week day camp the other parent would have to pay part of or they are using an unsafe and unlicensed daycare) the other parent cannot control what childcare is used.\n\nIt could very well be different in other states - but it is NOT universal and it is DANGEROUS to make blanket statements like this because what do you think happens to a parent who takes these things to court and loses because their state has clear cut rules about it? It makes them look bad and makes it harder for them to do something when there is a legitimate basis to take something to court because their prior, groundless filings can be used against them.\n\nWell meaning or not, it is inappropriate and can have real life ramifications if someone reads it and takes it as true because so many people are making the same blanket statements.", "Thank you! \nWhy do people do this? \nHow is her child benefitting from this situation? \nAnd if she\u2019s not then why is she downgrading her daughter\u2019s lifestyle and environment?", "My fianc\u00e9 and I have lived together for a year and he basically lived at my apartment before that; for all intents and purposes it\u2019s OUR cat now- but I brought him into the relationship and I do 95% of the pet chores.

All I meet are guys who ignore the childfree statement and say you'll change your mind when I clarify right away", "What?! How can someone tell that someone else \"is gonna want kids one day\"? That's crazy! And I'm with you. I'm not sterilized, but I don't want kids, either. I'm always surprised that people seem surprised when I tell them that. Like, not every woman HAS to have kids, especially to make someone else happy, or fit someone else's mold. People are weird sometimes.", "And that's probably a big part of why they get along. You aren't expecting your girlfriend to be instant-mom, nor your kids to accept her as one.", "Yes, this. My partner is a single dad and we wouldn\u2019t do this to me either. I\u2019m a single mom and the only person I\u2019d feel comfortable asking a favor like this from is my child\u2019s grandparents. And even then I\u2019d feel awful about it.", "I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m OPs age and I would never put up with this shit. I know plenty of women in their 20s who wouldn\u2019t either. I also know 50-something women who let men get away with all sorts of nonsense. I know Reddit loves age gap discourse but this isn\u2019t an age issue, it\u2019s an issue of having boundaries.", "You still learn things, but we\u2019re talking about basic boundaries and self-respect stuff.", "Yeah thats what i was getting at. I Def agree! 100%.  50yo or 30yo prolly doesn't matter. Only the fact they can sniff out people who are most likely to deal with their bullshit regardless of age.  It's sad. Hopefully OP will take this as a chance to reconsider this arrangement. Esp if there have been other issues and this was just the final straw type thing :/", "Fully agreed, boyfriend is an AH, just thought the end of the comment I replied to was a little unfair to his ex.", "Yup. Put up a meager fight about it, when he\u2019s gone, bring them to moms house or gmas on the guise of personal business and gtfo of that situation with no words. I\u2019m 40. I\u2019ve disliked all kids but my own for 20 years. I would never ever put up w this shit. \u201cYou\u2019re watching my kids for 10 days\u201d. *appalled face* NTF IM NOT! \u270c\ufe0f", "I'm 49 and would totally date a guy like that now. Lightsaber battles, Star Wars and popcorn sound like the perfect date.", "They would have lost me at Star Wars. No disrespect. It just isn\u2019t my thing."]}
