I told him it wouldn't have been an issue if he had gotten snipped years ago like he said he would. \nToday I told my parents I plan on getting tied. My mom is tied so she was supportive. My dad however asked why Husband doesn't just go get the snip? I didn't want to embarrass him so I lied and said I would rather just get tied.

Actions speak louder than words. Stop making excuses. \n\nI didn't embarrass you either, I actually covered your ass and lied to my own father about why I wanted to get my tubes tied, but you and I both know it's because YOU failed to plan - both in getting the snip and also having proper birth control like condoms - **and those failures damn near killed me.** \n\nIt's clear our reproductive health and family planning will ultimately fall to me - including the failures.

He mostly comes across as selfish, ESPECIALLY seeing how the miscarriage and most recent pregnancy impacted you. \n\nIf his excuse is vacations then he can stay home while you take the kids for fun until he decides to keep his word, and I\u2019d probably say no sex without condoms either - if at all.
