It was a difficult pregnancy. Many complications and at 30 weeks I was hospitalized and we both almost died.\n My son is 2 now and I have been asking my husband about getting the snip. Last night we had SX, he forgot to buy condoms and he didn't pull out in time. I know it was dumb so please don't remind me. I told him it wouldn't have been an issue if he had gotten snipped years ago like he said he would. \nToday I told my parents I plan on getting tied. My mom is tied so she was supportive. My dad however asked why Husband doesn't just go get the snip? I didn't want to embarrass him so I lied and said I would rather just get tied. In the car on the way home Husband begins to berate me about how it's my fault he can't get it done because I use up all his paid time off making plans. \nWe took 1 day off for weekend vacation, some days off doctors appointments for the kids, and he took off a week for my birthday. He gets 20 days PTO, and 2 weeks vacation. I reminded him of this. He insisted I embarrassed him in front of my dad. He is still claiming there hasn't been time.\n\n\nEdit: Info because my son is 2 he doesn't want to be held. My mom said my brother needs to start making some babies, I said yes but not me I'm getting tied.\n\nMy dad isn't snipped but he's technically my step dad.

You could have had it planned out for a year and had plenty of time off in reserve. This is not my failure. I have reminded you for over 5 years to get the snip, and you clearly just don't want to. Actions speak louder than words. Stop making excuses. \n\nI didn't embarrass you either, I actually covered your ass and lied to my own father about why I wanted to get my tubes tied, but you and I both know it's because YOU failed to plan - both in getting the snip and also having proper birth control like condoms - **and those failures damn near killed me.** \n\nIt's clear our reproductive health and family planning will ultimately fall to me - including the failures. So I am taking charge and doing it myself to prevent further failures on your part, and if that upsets you, well - too bad. Don't like it? Then get it done yourself or get off my back.\"", "NTA - it has been **5 years** if it was important to him, he would have made time. Instead, he made excuses and risked your life and your kids futures of growing up without a mother.\n\nHe\u2019s probably scared but he needs to grow tf up and use his words and communicate, not blame you for planning a good family life. He mostly comes across as selfish, ESPECIALLY seeing how the miscarriage and most recent pregnancy impacted you. \n\nIf his excuse is vacations then he can stay home while you take the kids for fun until he decides to keep his word, and I\u2019d probably say no sex without condoms either - if at all. You\u2019re assuming all the risk and emotional burden and he\u2019s just skipping along for five whole years like he\u2019s gotten away with it.", "NTA. Your husband sounds toxic AF.

Which sucks, because a tubal ligation is a much more serious surgery, but you're right to take your reproductive safety into your own hands.  And you're right to let your parents know about your surgery--what, were they just supposed to never know about it?  You were kind to try to protect your husband's feelings, and he's projecting because he feels guilty (he should--if he didn't want a vasectomy he should have told you a long time ago).", "NTA - your husband is. It's so much more invasive to have tubes tied than to have a vasectomy. My husband had one a few years ago and was fine in a few days. Your husband sounds like a selfish man.", "NTA despite what he says, about being willing to get the vasectomy, he doesn't want to.  He may have misconceptions about the procedure and/or what happens after.  I think it stinks that he's put you in the position of having to undergo anesthesia to have your tubes tied vs an office procedure.  He's not even responsible to ensure he has rubbers.  I would have replied to his comments of being embarassed... well you have had over 5 yrs to get it done, instead of coming up with a shit load of excuses.", "40% of men can get a woman pregnant with their pre-cum.

Only 1 day off used \ud83e\udd37", "Nta but holy crap The fact that you and the baby almost died and your husband is still being selfish baffles me as to why people stay with partners like this. You almost died, how is that not a wake up call for him?", "NTA. But your husband is a jerk. His surgery would be less invasive than yours, and if he won\u2019t get it done, he should at least wear a condom. It\u2019s easy to avoid these things when you are the one who has to live with the consequences.", "NTA - your husband is a self centered coward who would rather see you lose another baby or even die than be a little sore for a couple of days. Tell that man to move out and don\u2019t come back until he is snipped AND HAS PROOF and has adjusted his disgusting attitude. He is gaslighting you and being incredibly manipulative/abusive.\n\nMy husband got the snip at a mobile forward army hospital that was running training drills in Korea. He did it at the mobile hospital voluntarily and was never even sore! Your husband is just being selfish and an AH.", "NTA\u2014 My husband said it wasn\u2019t as bad as most dental procedures he\u2019s had. It was one day of mild discomfort, similar to getting two piercings in terms of pain and risk.

You even tried to protect him after he did mess up constantly by not doing what he says he would", "Why the fuck weren't you taking birth control when you knew you didn't want more kids? \n\nA good partner will be proactive about also being responsible for birth control but you dont have a good partner clearly so as the cis woman in the relationship in the end the responsibility to protect yourself falls on you and you alone to make smart choices for your own body.", "NTA but also, understand - even if he'd been snipped? Sometimes vasectomies [don't work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6844545/) and men can go on to have more unexpected kids. Even w/ a vasectomy other BC options are a good idea when you're worried about pregnancy for health reasons.", "Is it me or do you two have incredibly different opinions on having more kids? If he was serious when he first brought up getting the vasectomy he would've done it, and even if he still didnt after seeing you almost die after very clearly expressing your want years prior to not have more children that would've been the last straw.\n\nAnd don't vasectomies take 1/3'd of the time for recovery compared to getting your tubes tied? He's had like 140 pto days in the past 7 years and a vasectomy takes like 8 at most.. he's been taking you for one *long* ride.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He is also ridiculous to claim that he can\u2019t because you use all his days. Even if you were somehow doing that, he is an adult. He can say, \u201cI need these 2-3 for my procedure/recovery. If he cares about your health, he will take responsibility and do it already.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ll add that if you happen to now be pregnant and if you then end up getting a C section, they can tie you off at the same time.

My husband was nervous to get snipped but I agreed to get tied because I was already having a c section and it wouldn\u2019t be extra for me. It was horrible.

Thank goodness the D&C before the attempted ablation reset me somehow where I ended up going back to normal. I was on birth control after my tubes which was a huge downer and messed with my mood.

No need to apologise, your dad is your dad, blood or otherwise :)", "This procedure's going to be really complex and hard on your body compared to how a vasectomy would affect him.

They did it on Friday and was back at work on Monday. Moving a little slow on Monday. It's  still harder and more dangerous tthan a vasectomy."]}
