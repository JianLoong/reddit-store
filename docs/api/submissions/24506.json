I told him it wouldn't have been an issue if he had gotten snipped years ago like he said he would. \nToday I told my parents I plan on getting tied. My mom is tied so she was supportive.

Actions speak louder than words. Stop making excuses. \n\nI didn't embarrass you either, I actually covered your ass and lied to my own father about why I wanted to get my tubes tied, but you and I both know it's because YOU failed to plan - both in getting the snip and also having proper birth control like condoms - **and those failures damn near killed me.** \n\nIt's clear our reproductive health and family planning will ultimately fall to me - including the failures.

He mostly comes across as selfish, ESPECIALLY seeing how the miscarriage and most recent pregnancy impacted you. \n\nIf his excuse is vacations then he can stay home while you take the kids for fun until he decides to keep his word, and I\u2019d probably say no sex without condoms either - if at all.

You've birthed 4 children (from what I understand on your post) and miscarried 1. You've been through difficult pregnancy symptoms, complications, and multiple painful childbirths and child loss. Yet he cant take 1 afternoon off to get the snip. If he's scared, he needs to man up. Does he think you weren't scared about the pregnancy or the births, that you weren't scared about the pain?? You had to go through all that, and having the snip is nowhere near comparable. \n\n2) He also has no respect for your bodily autonomy and wishes. He didn't buy Condoms or 'forgot'. And then he didn't even pull out!! Admittedly you are partly to blame for continuing sex without a condom too, but the least he could have done is pull out. You can't control that side of things, but he could. It almost makes me wonder if he wants you to get pregnant again?? \nThe fact that he knowingly and purposefully chose not to pull out is extremely disrespectful and reckless when he knows you don't want to get pregnant again. \n\n3) He's taking 0 responsibility with birth control. Why is all up to you to go through all the difficulties and pain of multiple pregnancies and births yet he can't handle having a simple snip?? They don't even have to be under general anaesthetic so it's not even a major surgery for him. However it is for you. \n\nIf he definitely doesn't want any children in future, he should be the one to get the snip. \n\nYou shouldn't have to be the one to go through another difficult procedure when it's so much less invasive for the man. \n\nWomen have to deal.with the side effects of contraception pills or injections or implants etc, and go through procedures to have coils or iuds implanted, have painful periods every month, deal with side effects of hormonal contraception for years, and some go through the difficulty and pain of pregnancy and birth. Yet he can't manage to have a minor procedure done??? \n\nI'd be having a serious conversation with him, because his excuse is ridiculous. You can take an afternoon off work for a medical procedure and shouldn't be penalised for it. Or like someone else said, take Friday afternoon off work for the procedure and he'd be able to go back to work by Monday. \nAlthough men like to milk their pain as severe and difficult, the equivalent of man flu type thing, but thousands of men go through it. \n\nYou need to talk to him and tell him he needs to step up and take some responsibility for your birth control methods. DO NOT HAVE SEX WITH HIM AGAIN WITHOUT A CONDOM !!! NO CONDOM = NO SEX. \n\nAnd I partly be inclined to do no sex till he's had the snip. Although that's being manipulative which isn't a good thing for a relationship. But Condoms aren't 100% effective, so you need to be careful even if you do use them till he's had the snip. \n\nI'm not judging with this question, but I'm curious as to why you didn't get the morning after pill after he failed to pull out if you didn't want to risk being pregnant again? If there a reason you can't take it? \nAgain not judging just curious. \n\nBut I'd be putting my foot down now as you shouldn't have to go through a major procedure under anaesthetic because he can't man up and get the snip.

I interrupted her schpiel with \"I have over a decade of hard data showing that my base temp is 97, and in order for there to be an average of 98, somebody has to be 97 and someone else 99. It's in my chart.\" She hushed about it and gave me meds. A few hours later I got chills. Took my temp and it was 101. I messaged the NP to tell her thanks for the meds because my temp was now 101 and I was feeling the crappiest I had since the corona19 hit our house in 2022. I was also dealing with some long covid bc I am asthmatic prone to bronchitis. \n\nMy primary doctor is amazing and trusts me when I say that I know my body. I can literally feel crud creeping down into my lungs. She will not hesitate to get me meds if that happens. She has been working hard to get my asthma under control and we finally got it managed. Now if I start feeling like something is creeping in, I can make better use of the immunity bolstering tools I have and I have less chance of a flare turning into bronchitis. I also have gotten to an agreement that a week of steroids started soon enough can avoid antibiotics. But every time I have to go to urgent care or an ER, i have my fertility app open and ready to show the data."]}
