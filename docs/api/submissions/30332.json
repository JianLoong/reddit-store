We\u2019ve had our ups and downs but ultimately, she\u2019s family and I would never want to intentionally hurt her. One thing she does a lot during arguments with her mum is say \u2018well dad would let me do X\u2019 or \u2018maybe I\u2019ll go stay with dad then\u2019. I never met her dad. I\u2019ve seen him a few times but I was never properly introduced to him. Him and Lucy (my stepmum) had a bad breakup and she didn\u2019t want him to met my mum or me which I can understand given what she\u2019s told me about him.\n\nFor the past week, Jane had been even more irritable than usual. I tried talking to her but she shut me out. Lucy and mum told me she\u2019d come around and not to pry.\n\nI found out a few days ago that she had been using my expensive skincare and had almost emptied a bottle that takes me 5 months to finish, in a week. As well as using (and almost emptying) all my other skincare stuff. I was pissed and confronted her, telling her to replace it. She started crying and getting angry at me. She said I was being an \u2018annoying cunt\u2019 for \u2018chasing her up on facewash\u2019 and that I need to leave her alone. I will admit, we both said harmful things which I regret and I ended up saying \u2018why don\u2019t you go live with your dad since he\u2019ll let you off!\u2019. Jane\u2019s face dropped and she said \u2018my dad died last week you cunt!\u2019\n\nShe ran and locked herself in her room after she said that and I immediately regretted what I said. Shortly after, Lucy and mum came home and I explained what had happened. They both said I needed to apologise which I agreed with. Lucy went to talk to Jane and afterwards told me Jane would only forgive me if I was \u2018grounded\u2019 until the New Year and she had free range of my wardrobe (she loves my style but can\u2019t afford to buy clothes to fit it at the moment). I said no to both. I didn\u2019t bring up her dad as a \u2018gotcha he\u2019s dead!\u2019 moment as I didn\u2019t know he had passed. Obviously, if I had known I wouldn\u2019t have said anything about it and would have treated her outbursts/change in behaviour differently because I know now she was grieving.\n\nLucy and mum then said if I won\u2019t do those things, I should at least drive her around to her friends, university, etc. I again said no. We both go to different universities and the logistics won\u2019t work. Lucy said if I can\u2019t make it up to Jane, I shouldn\u2019t expect her to forgive me. I said I don\u2019t need Jane\u2019s sisterhood if it\u2019s only based on transactional things like car rides or clothes.\n\nJane is fuming with me and Lucy and mum think I'm being petty and difficult for not 'even attempting' to patch things up with Jane. I don't expect her to forgive me straight away as that's not how humans work but no apology would suffice as she doesn't want an apology, she wants my things.\n\nSo as it stands, it's 3 against 1.

It's time to stop apologizing and go on the offensive. Why the F did nobody mention this to you beforehand? You had clearly mentioned that she was shutting you out to Lucy but you were told \"she'd come around\" when she was acting out because her dad just died? Your response which was to apologize was frankly a bit doormat-y. If I were you I'd have gotten angry at Lucy for not telling you what happened, or at the very least not informing you that Jane was going through a difficult time. You shouldn't apologize for not knowing information that was intentionally withheld from you.\n\nI'd consider that to be such a large lie of omission that it's practically malicious. You were basically set up to be the bad guy so that Jane could then use you as her emotional punching bag.", "What kind of dysfunctional family are you living in that no one told you that someone you live with lost a parent??? And they think it's okay for her to demand access to your clothes or rides in the car in order for her to forgive you? Get out of that house as soon as you can, and when it's your turn to create a family (whatever that looks like), remember these days and make different choices.\n\nNTA.", "I'm gonna come down on the NTA side here. You literally didn't know her dad was dead, and as it's a frequent theme for her to invoke him, it wasn't an out-of-left-field thing to bring up during an argument. She was using your products without permission, for which you have every right to be upset with her. I think it's fair to want an apology from you, for hurting her like that; it was a low blow, even if it was an accidental one. She also owes YOU an apology for stealing your stuff, tho. I think you seem pretty even, and she's milking it to try to get perks from you.", "You're NTA. Your stepsister is now trying to weaponize her grief against you. Saying something unintentional does not require you to meet the demands she is making. \n\nAnd has anyone even remembered that *she* is the one who always made the threat to go live with her dad? You were just throwing her own threat back at her. It's not your fault no one told you he had died.", "Info-Is there a reason nobody told you he died? That seems bizarre.

You can't avoid soemthing if you don't know it is problematic.\n\nAnd, you were right to hold her accountable for her actions.\n\nYour words were hurtful but they came about as a result of her failure to take responsibility for her actions. The death of her father did not suddenly cause her to steal from you - which is what she did in using your skin care products without permission.\n\nShe is a theif. She stole from you. She owes YOU an apology. You were the bigger person and apologized and she now owes YOU an apology for stealing from you.\n\nFlip this around on Lucy and your Mom. Focus on the theft. The fact that your words were out of turn only because you were unaware of his passing but Jane CHOSE to steal from you and she did it out of selfishness and malice.", "NTA\n\nYou made a comment in the heat of the moment, for which you are willing to apologise and that should suffice.

I'd start looking for other housing arrangements and get a lock on your door. She used up all your products as a deliberate baiting, knowing full well she could then cry the victim once you popped, and milk it for everything she'd been coveting to get her nasty hands on. You were set up, by her and the adults in your house. Screw them.", "I think she used this as a conviennent excuse to make you the bad guy. I\u2019m willing to bet this is a pattern that happens often: she takes advantage of you, you confront her, and she finds a way to make you the bad guy. She just wanted to get out of the fact that she was stealing your stuff. There\u2019s no way you could\u2019ve known and you\u2019re nta, she sounds incredibly manipulative.

You live in the same house as them and didn't know your step sister's father died a week ago? Your parents are like \"your sister is sad her dad is dead, you should drive her to school and lend her your clothes to make it up to her\"? It's like you're an Alien or ChatGPT trying to human.", "NTA\n\nThere's no reason I can think of that justifies you not being informed that someone you live with is going through something so traumatic.

Had you offered any of the things Jane asked for on your own to help show how sincerely sorry you are, or doing something nice like making her favorite cookies or a cup of tea or whatever else would make sense, it would be a selfless gesture to help repair the damage you unintentionally caused \n\nAlso 1) you are 20 years old, being grounded at that age is kind of ridiculous, and a younger sibling or any kind doesn't get to make that call. 2) the fact that she wanted you grounded shows that her concern is punishing you for her pain, and making sure she gets something from you that you wouldn't otherwise consent to. 3) just because she's grieving doesn't give her the right to treat you poorly, take her frustrations out on you or give her a right to things that are not hers. \n\nYes she's going through a significant loss and could use some compassionate and grace, but your mom and Lucy not seeing anything wrong with the situation as far as their or Jane's actions are concerned is, honestly, a little messed up.", "Sometimes people are angry because they can't have what u have or be you....

You're right to stand your ground. And I'm not calling your sister the asshole because she's grieving and lashing out -- she will probably regret all this later, the attempts to be manipulative and get access to your wardrobe are just desperate attempts to feel better, to find something that will make it stop hurting for a minute. That doesn't make her right or mean that her actions are okay, but it does mean I'm not going to hold her completely responsible right now. If she's still doing this stuff in a few weeks, that will be a different story.\n\nHOWEVER. Lucy and your mom are the adults in the room and they need to be controlling Jane. When she made this demand to them, they should have gently and calmly explained to her that feeling bad isn't an excuse to try to cross others' boundaries. You should never have even heard about that. I also agree with others that it's really fucking weird that no one told you so you could be there for her and be understanding if she's a little more difficult for awhile. She honestly sounds like a bit of a monster, and the reason is because the adults around her are enabling her and refusing to set boundaries, especially with them acting like you're in the wrong for not letting yourself be walked on. The vibe is that she's been cast as the precious princess whose feelings must not be hurt, and you've been cast as the supporting character who exists to make the princess feel better and make the parents' lives easier. The other word for this is golden child and scapegoat dynamics, or GC/SG.\n\nIf your mom and Lucy won't listen to reason, that Jane's grief is not an excuse to use and manipulate you for material things, then that's on them. They're 100% the assholes here. I would suggest just ignoring them. If they bring up Jane or act angry with you, show no emotion, don't try to reason with them, give one-word answers if they ask you questions. Or even just a withering stare if they ask an obviously inflammatory question like \"don't you care about others' feelings?\"\n\nMake your apology to Jane, and in a few days once everyone has cooled down a little, offer to do something nice for her. Maybe offer to take her shopping and get her one or two pieces that she couldn't afford on her own (be transparent about your budget with this). Or take her to a nice dinner or something. If she rejects it, that's fine, but you will have made a gesture and made clear that you still love her, you just won't allow your boundaries to be stepped on.", "INFO How in this world did your family, with who you live, become so dysfunctional that nobody even bothered to tell you that your sister\u2019s dad died?

Grief does not excuse theft, and your stepmother dropped the ball hard not letting you know what was going on with Jane's father.

Holy crap.  Why on earth wouldn't they give you important information like that?  I would tell them something like, \"I am very sorry to have rubbed salt in that wound.  If I'd had any idea that her father died, I would never have said that.  However, it's not reasonable to expect to punish me for an unintentionally cruel remark, but  to expect not so much as an apology from her for stealing my products intentionally.  I have apologized, and given that I wasn't given information I needed to avoid that mistake, I think that's fair.  If you feel more punishment is needed, consider that the loss of my products, worth xxx dollars, might have already been punishment enough.  I expect her to stay out of my stuff unless I give permission.  And I will never again throw her dad in her face.  \n\nHonestly, though, you may want to consider moving out if you can.  I get a sense that if sis gets hold of your clothes, she will also be hard on them.  She doesn't have a lot of respect for your property, and the entitlement to expect you to be grounded and have to share your stuff for a single remark is off the charts crazy.  If that was considered acceptable to your mom and stepmom, that also says something's not right.

As you did not know, and no one in the household had the courtesy to mention it, then you are not wholly to blame for the situation. They own 9/10's of it.   \n3. Lastly, she's already stolen your skincare items. Your apology should be sufficient as they created the situation in the first place. And no, she doesn't get free range of your belongings because she's grieving and her own mother couldn't look beyond the end of her nose to mention why she's been so off lately. That was unfair to your stepsister and unfair to you. If you had known what was going on, then you might have been a lot more tolerant of the situation as a whole.  And you wouldn't be where you are.   \n\n\nYou're NTA.  Everyone who kept that from you is, and no one should expect you to give up your personal belongings because you didn't want your stuff stolen in the first place.", "NTA. Your Mum and Step-Mum shoulder the blame for this. That's a significant life event for your step-sister and they should have given you the heads up. Also, just because her father died doesn't give her the right to touch your stuff. I would be withdrawing the apology and demanding an apology from your Mum for not sharing that information in the first place.", "NTA. you should have been informed of her dad's passing before you made that remark, by any of the other three people. The fact that you didn't know seems like it could've been done deliberately, whether it's by your stepsister or someone else. Also, your step sister is grieving, but there's nothing she can gain from getting you grounded. She just wants your stuff, probably in an attempt to use that to help her, but even then it's shitty of her to not ask consent. IDC what her emotional state is, she's in the wrong here. Knowing her emotional state helps understand intent or actions but doesn't excuse wrong actions. And you already apologized for bringing up her dad without knowing, so what else can you do other than be a door mat?", "NTA. Everyone else TA. You have literally done nothing wrong, Jane has been stealing from you and owes you not only an apology but reimbursement.

They really need a reality check.", "Nta. Why aren't they even attempting to get her to pay you back for your skincare. I am sorry for her lose but it's no excuse to use other people's things and then demand more things when they upset you.", "Nta", "NTA I like how you put that it's transactional. Its almost as if she's taking advantage of her dad dying so she could get things she wouldn't otherwise 'reasonably' ask for..... and now it's just out of pity. I'd apologise for the comment but nothing else", "NTA they are basically mad because you can't read minds. she was irritable & isolating herself and you were told she would come around. nobody thought the DEATH of her FATHER was relevant info??? you sound pretty understanding tbh but the apology/ammends seems more like a punishment. as others have pointed out it also seems very transactional.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know, and you apologized when you did know. This was an honest mistake and doesn\u2019t deserve any penalty, let alone being grounded for months or letting your sister trash your wardrobe or acting as her personal servant. PS she wouldn\u2019t forgive you if you did those things, either.", "YTA- here\u2019s why. You live in the same household and didn\u2019t know your sister father passed away. \nIn the argument you admitted you both said bad things to each other. \n\nYour sister essentially is asking for an apology that is not lip service but an act of service. I suggest you give her a few suggestions of things you\u2019re willing to do to make up to her- rather than her dictate the terms. \nRemind her it started with her stealing your things but your harsh words were unintentional.", "NTA. You cannot be punished, particularly with Jane's absurd suggestions, when nobody told you Jane's father had died. You're not a mindreader. Jane is an entitled pain in the arse, even though she is grieiving at the moment.", "This does not change the fact that she stole from you / used things that weren\u2019t hers without permission. \n\nShe needs to replace those, you can\u2019t use her apologies as skincare. \n\nYou should go on the offensive here. You came from ignorance with the dad remark, she willingly took your stuff.\n\nNTA", "This. And if they are going to talk about pettiness, how exactly does grounding you for 2 months and letting her have free range to your wardrobe make up for that, especially after she stole your stuff? Material stuff doesn\u2019t seem to fit this situation. You need a talk about how Lucy failed to inform you of important details, and had you known, you would never have said that. They failed you. You are absolutely NTA", "And OP, they don't think you're an AH - they think if they make you feel bad they can bully you into doing what they want. Jane's the squeaky wheel, and you're the sacrificial grease. \n\nIf they come at you about it again, tell them to go kick rocks - that you aren't apologizing for misstepping when you were set up to do so, nor for being upset that you were stolen from. They set you up for failure - and they didn't do it for no reason.", "that\u2019s why it\u2019s three against one.

I would talk to Lucy and inform her \n\n\"Look, I am sorry for saying what I said and yes I am truly sorry but literally NO ONE in this house gave me a heads up or thought it was important for me to know so I may give the benefit of doubt. Honestly I am okay with apologizing but I will not give in to her form of transactional apologizing. You might think I don't want to make up for this \"sister-ship\" but it does not seem like a relationship if I am not informed of a significant information, made to be the bad guy just because of omitted information in an argument that was caused by her theft of my belongings. I will continue to say I am sorry but I will not give to her unrealistic demands just to make her feel like she should forgive me.\"\n\nHonestly something like this.

You also didn't know about your stepsister's father's passing, and you apologized when you found out.\n\nThe fact that your stepsister wants all to have free reign of your possessions and the other adults are backing her up is pure lunacy. I suggest telling your stepsister something like, \"I'm sorry again about bringing up your father during our argument. As a reminder, I had no idea he passed because no one told me. However, his passing does not give you free reign over my belongings. You need to stop stealing my things.\"\n\nIf she doesn't stop, well then, maybe it IS time to go to the police.

I suspect they are focussed on the enormous loss but that doesn\u2019t give them an excuse to stop parenting! \n\nYou need to apologize for saying harmful things. Telling someone else they should leave the house is harmful even if dad hadn\u2019t just died and it was no longer an option.\n\nThat said, I would be really hurt if a close friend had a parent died and they deliberately didn\u2019t mention it to me. Not telling the people you live with that someone you are close to is really awful. When is the funeral? Are you not going?!? Why aren\u2019t you invited?!?\n\nI think you should sit down with your parents and ideally Jane and say that you need to talk to them about why they didn\u2019t feel you were close enough to Jane and Lucy to let you know that a significant event like a parent\u2019s death had occurred. My aunt tells me when her cousins I\u2019ve never met passed away because they are important people in her life and even though I don\u2019t know them I am very close to my aunt. What else aren\u2019t they telling you? This does affect you because it affects your sister. It also affects your step mom, who was close enough to this man to have a child with him. Bad breakup or not, she presumably isn\u2019t unaffected; at minimum her kid is seriously affected and that affects her! Is she or is she not your stepmom? If she is claiming a motherly role in your life then the omission here is egregious in my opinion.\n\nThe second thing you need to talk about is the argument. You have the reasonable expectation that when you buy things for your use that they don\u2019t get used by others without permission. You handled it badly, but if you don\u2019t have the right to keep your own things safe I think you need to figure out how to move out. \n\nFinally, you need to talk about the harmful things that were said. You apologized but an apology without restitution is rather hollow. Are you in the habit of saying mean things when you fight? How can you change your fighting style? Can you work with your parents or maybe even your sister to role play how the discussion over your frustrations with sister using up all your lotion should have gone? (If you do it with sister you must get your parents to be referee). How can you make it up to your sister?\n\nDid you tell your sister that you love her? That you are sorry that you were mean to her? That although she can\u2019t use your things you were wrong to suggest she should move out? That you are sorry about her dad? That you miss her? It sounds like she really admires you. Maybe you could take her thrifting and buy her an outfit or something. Or you could take her out for a sister date; go to a movie or a coffee.

I also care that your step-mother is pressuring you to let her daughter get away with taking your stuff without consequence, and trying to punish you for something that you had no idea was the wrong thing to say.  She's favoring her daughter and this is not OK.

Why on Earth did the adults here not tell you that he had passed away, even after you brought up her behaviour? Did they not know either?
