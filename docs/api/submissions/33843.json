Maybe she could give you experiences as gifts instead? Then you could spend time together as your gift and she could still get to spoil you.", "ESH, I think you should have some therapy to address underlying issue but also it\u2019s a simple request for your SO to respect. Maybe a compromise is you start working on yourself and meanwhile put a budget to what your SO can spend on the present?", "NTA since you clearly state you don't want gifts.\n\nbut maybe try to suggest gifts that are time spent together? would that be comfortable to you?", "Esh. I get you have difficult feelings but you're supposed to work thru trauma, not take it out on your loved ones. That's what adults do. Most couples that celebrate the holiday trade gifts, and your girl is understandably upset because instead of comprising it sounds like you're in a victims mindset and bringing down her perspective of the holidays. I might understand more if there was something truly horrific in your past but I think a lot of us are familiar with being poor and that's not a great excuse to opt out of the holidays. Especially since you're now an adult yourself, I would assume working? With an income? I'm even a tiny bit suspicious this might be partly you not wanting to put the effort in with her? A lot of people are anxious and intimidated by gift giving. I think you need to maybe address your inner turmoil or else everyone you date is going to have to learn to not celebrate gift related events with you. And that sounds kinda lame. Birthdays? Christmas? Anniversaries? Sounds like all of those would be triggering and aside from Jehovas witness idk anyone who doesn't participate in never giving gifts.", "YTA. I understand how you feel but what happens when you become a father? I think you best bet with her is maybe set a price limit on the gifts you exchange or do homemade/handmade gifts. Think of something thoughtful to do for your girlfriend and mom.", "Is your mother still alive?  If so, perhaps you could start a new tradition in which you and your GF pick out a really lovely gift for your mom each Christmas?  \n\nI would also suggest that you get yourself into therapy so that being given things is something you're able to accept with pleasure and appreciation.  I understand how your childhood got you to where you are, but it's not a healthy place and it's time for you to try to move past it.\n\nFinally, at the point when you're in therapy dealing with this, talk with your GF about it.

I also don't like receiving Christmas gifts (for different reasons). I realize this is a \"ME\" issue and one of the many reasons I'm in therapy. I agree with previous commenters saying therapy would be beneficial. I think EVERYONE can benefit from therapy. Even if you don't have a history of trauma or any major interpersonal issues, therapy can help you to see things through a different lense and can help you to achieve more self awareness/understanding. \nHowever, I don't think you're the AH in this situation because you've made a concerted effort to communicate your preference to enjoy her company rather than to receive a materialistic show of affection. I do wonder though, have you communicated to her WHY you feel the way you do about receiving gifts? If not, doing so might help her to understand. If you have and she's disregarded it, I would have issue with that fact. You've set a boundary and she continues to trample over it. However, I don't think she's trying to be malicious. I'm hoping it's just the opposite and she's simply projecting her enjoyment of receiving gifts so she's trying to illicit the same feelings of joy she experiences if the tables were turned. She just needs to actually listen to you so that she can show up in your relationship the way you need her to. If she simply can't or won't do so, you may just not need compatible enough to stay together. Compromises must be made but not just by her.", "NTA. She is being deliberately obtuse and dismissive of your feelings in favor of her own. Its manipulative and controlling. Not a good thing. You need to sit her down and tell her this has to stop.", "YTA\n\nYou're wrapped up in your self-pity and loathing, and destroying other people's Christmas joy; that's an A move. Your childhood is what is was, but it's over now and you need to get over yourself and move into today.", "NAH", "Sounds like you could do with some therapy.", "NTA. You have told her repeatedly that you don't want presents and she keeps ignoning your feelings. It's almost as if she thinks if she keeps at it, you will get over your childhood trauma. And when it doesn't she gets mad at you.\n\nI have to admit it would be hard for me to not get someone a present but if they were that against it I would do it. My needs to be a giver can be filled another way as can hers.", "YTA\n\nsorry but you are.\n\nIf it is affecting you this much you need to get some therapy before this girl has had enough and leaves you.\n\nOh and you are going to need to apologise to her as well.", "NAH\n\nSo, do you know about Love Langages? It sounds like hers is gift giving. You need to understand that even though you have an extreme aversion to gifts (which is something you need to work through), she deserves having a comfortable avenue open to show you affection. You're taking that away from her. \n\nIt's not your fault, but remember that it's not hers either.", "NTA \n\nYou are being so clear and she is choosing to ignore that. I disagree with those that have said N A H as I believe your girlfriend ignoring your wishes and then getting mad you don\u2019t react the way she wants is very problematic. \n\nI don\u2019t like physical gifts but experiences instead. And some of my favourite gifts have been tickets to the zoo, cinema, a dinner out, etc\u2026. I understand the want people have to give gifts. But there is no rule that gift has to be physical and can\u2019t be something really special together! And the fact people will insist on spending $500+ on a gift you don\u2019t want instead of a weekend away etc\u2026. Is them being selfish. They aren\u2019t thinking of who they are giving to.", "NAH, more like a communication issue. Some people's love language is gift-giving, and even if they aren't able to articulate why, it's genuinely hurtful when they perceive that their gift isn't as appreciated as they want it to be.", "NAH - I feel like you might be clinging a bit too hard to your past, but you are certainly not an AH for feeling the way you do. Therapy could be beneficial, but I honestly think anyone and everyone could benefit from a little (or a lot) of therapy.\n\nYour girlfriend isn't an AH because, I assume, she's honestly trying to share a holiday that is special to her with you in the way it has been special to her. Unless her giving you gifts is actually traumatizing, which it may well be, I think you could put a little effort into trying to appreciate the effort if not the gift.\n\nSometimes people just get stuck in a headspace and can't get out of their own way. I get that the holiday bring up bad feelings/memories, but I think you are blocking yourself from creating new experiences and memories in the here and now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What ends a relationship is a lack of respect and consideration for the other's pain, behavior that the girlfriend is having.\nFor years he says he doesn't like gifts and for years she IGNORES what he asks and does what she wants, knowing that it brings him pain.\nIt would be different if she had come from a place of concern for him, but her behavior is not one of wanting to help him heal from a trauma, but of someone who thinks that her joy in giving gifts is more important than the pain that this gesture causes him.", "Nah, I think it does make them non functional. This isn't about a hypothetical set of people. His girlfriend values gift giving. Period. Fact. Its probably a cultural/religious tradition that she has a lot of history with, like a lot of people. By the way, the joy that people get from gift giving is not all rooted in materialism. \n\nNot to mention, its not like theres no quality time because people exchange gifts. Sounds like they can do both, except, an adult man is unwilling and unable to work through childhood difficulties and would rather draw a hard line over something very simple that brings his partner joy? Even as I'm typing this I'm like wow, non functional. Sounds silly and extreme over *gift giving* doesn't it? \n\nIf the trauma is so serious that a person has to impact their partners norms on such a nonharmful practice, they probably need more help and therapy instead of a relationship. Everyone deserves compromise which op is not considering per his report.", "Yeah, I missed that in my first read of the post; I edited my answer to you. \n\nBut that's also not what love languages purport to be; they are our default in how we express affection for others. Gf may not be conscious of why she's defaulting to that, which would mean it's not malicious.\n\nAnd, there's also a certain point where one has to ask, what has OP done to address this trauma? After years of the same thing, OP should probably be realizing that telling her, \"respect my wishes, even though I don't respect yours,\" hasn't worked either; he probably doesn't realize that rejecting her offer of a gift, preemptively or not, can come off like that. But I don't think either of them are being malicious, so they should probably talk about a new way forward.", "I get what you are saying, and I almost want to agree with you, but the sticking point for me is that the cart is before the horse. To accept that the girlfriend should respect his wishes and get him nothing is to enable his maladjusted mindset (even with the best of intentions). This isn't the real answer, even if the girlfriend respecting his wishes is better in general.\n\nI think before it gets to that, he should recognize that this attitude is not something he should expect his girlfriend to enable and entrench in their relationship going forward. The real answer is for him to realize that he should work on himself and *then* his girlfriend sensitively working with him on that could come into play, with an actual solution that is healthy for OP and the relationship as the goal -- rather than the enabling of what is in essence a harmful mindset.\n\nHe can have his preferences and his girlfriend should respect them and not try to impose what she thinks he *should* like, granted -- but even OP knows that his attitude to presents is a maladaption, a result of past issues, and not a simple, genuine preference. \n\nYou pull out weeds and water flowers -- not the other way around.", "Dude, we have no clue what her history/cultural whatever with gift giving is.  And honestly?  It doesn\u2019t matter.  He said plainly that he doesn\u2019t want her to do something because he doesn\u2019t like and she chose to do it anyway.  He communicated with her, said no, and then she went ahead and did it anyway. Is SHE not impacting HIM when she does something that he has repeatedly asked her not to do? If she wants to be upset because he told her \u201cno, please don\u2019t do this\u201d, that is her issue.  Not his.\n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t really want to continue this discussion because, as I\u2019ve said before, she is putting her own feelings above his and is continuing to ignore a boundary he has made.  It\u2019s not \u201csilly\u201d, and I find the way this guy\u2019s feelings have been trivialized pretty insulting. :/", "I agree that it would be better for his future if he deals with the traumas that happened in his past, not only because he is unable to receive gifts, but because these traumas still affect various aspects of his life (even if he doesn't realize it yet).\nThe problem (that I see) is that the pressure she is putting on him only harms this possible path to healing. Because either he starts to fake happiness or he changes for her, which is not sustainable.\nI think they both need to talk and try to reach a compromise, but he must be the protagonist, the desire to change must come from him, in his time and she has to learn to put him (in this case) as a priority.\nIf the rest of the relationship is good, there is no reason why this should be impossible. Her giving time, space and understanding (in this aspect of the relationship) may be her greatest gift to him.", "Christmas is in itself a cultural and religious observance. Non religious people in the US and UK still observe traditions of Christmas, and that's what this post is about... so we definitely do know what her background is like? Hello?\n\nAnd it's not his trauma or past that I trivialize, it's his unwillingness to address it and work on it to avoid impacting his partner negatively. That's definitely a little childish, and it doesn't stop at just Christmas. If spending money triggers him, then every milestone she would have to change her own expectations and preferences, forever? Jesus. What about buying a home together? Paying for children? Or name any other big ticket, even aside from gift giving. \n\nYeah....Time to grow up.", "K \ud83e\udd2a"]}
