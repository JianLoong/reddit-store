I asked her to show me the routine, and put nicely, it's not very developed yet. I tried telling her that a kid's birthday party might not be the best place to perform a solo dance at, but she got a little upset and said I was being controlling and pushy. To be honest, I just don't want her to regret this decision later if she ends up embarrassing herself in front of all the kids and parents.

Denying your wife this will most probably make her feel less than and inferior.

Especially the thought of her (step?)son being embarrassed of her. \n\nPersonally, I'd do what I could to get my wife to let my son experience his birthday as he wants, while encouraging her to go to a dance school, or find some other outlet for her passion project.

Neither she nor your son will live it down.\nShe doesn\u2019t need to use his birthday as a showcase for a skill she hasn\u2019t even learned yet.", "NTA. \n\nWhat a bizarre time and place for an interpretive dance routine. Seems like more of a \u201clook at me!\u201d moment for her than a celebration for your kid. \n\nAlso she\u2019s probably going to be pissed/embarrassed WHEN someone laughs. It\u2019s nice that you\u2019re supportive though.", "Your kids gonna get bullied really badly if she does this. Even if she was a genuine professional dancers your kid still would get bullied for this. Its simply a inappropriate time and event for this and honestly she should absolutely have that drilled into her head before the party. Also its shitty to upstage your own kid on his birthday in general. NTA", "NTA", "NTA - this is an incredibly selfish thing for her to do.  Your poor son will be so embarrassed and for what, to feed the ego of a 35 year old woman with a captive child audience on her son\u2019s birthday?!", "NTA My son is almost 9 and he\u2019d would be so embarrassed he\u2019d never speak to me again, also he would be teased until the end of time. Don\u2019t let her do that to him, the party is about him not her. Maybe suggest she can perform the birthday routine for you and him privately after the party. Why on earth would she ever think this was reasonable?", "NTA - it's not a party for her.  It's for your kid.", "NTA. She is going to humiliate your son in front of his friends. Doing an interpretive dance number at a nine year old\u2019s birthday party is weird and it will make everyone feel awkward when it does not go well. She needs to admit to herself that this is not something she is doing for her son, and that she\u2019s trying to hijack his party as an opportunity to show off her new passion. It is unfair and I do not think you should let this go.", "All those boys will be at a loss when she does this dance. Staring blankly at her. She will be the talk of the school for sure. Poor kid. NTA,  but she will be if she does this.", "hahahaha", "Lol. It\u2019s not a little unhinged to turn your kid\u2019s ninth bday party into a chance to show off your dance moves. NTA.", "NTA\n\nIf your wife goes through with this, it's very possible that this will follow your son until he leaves for college.", "NTA, please do not let her ruin your sons social life \ud83d\udc80", "...What?", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s your son\u2019s birthday, not your wife\u2019s. A bunch of kids don\u2019t want to watch a Mom\u2019s interpretive dance. She does this your poor son is going to get teased for years.", "NTA\n\nInterpretive dance is truly *Awful* \ud83d\ude02\n\nI\u2019ve seen some professionals do some interesting things before but personally I can\u2019t stand interpretive dance", "Honestly this cracked me up! I don\u2019t even know if you\u2019re an asshole or not but I don\u2019t think so. \ud83d\ude02 ask if she\u2019ll do an interpretive dance afterwards and co-create it with your kiddo. \ud83d\ude09", "Is there any chance that she\u2019s messing with you? Either way, NTA. I can\u2019t think of a single 9 year old that would want their YouTube-trained mother doing a dance routine.", "NTA. 9 year olds aren't, as a general rule, the most cultured of folk. So unless she's planning on riding in on a tank whilst dressed as a Pok\u00e9mon and doing a 619 a la Rey Mysterio, she's likely going to embarrass the child and set him up to get made fun of the rest of the school year.", "Well maybe it doesn't have to be right after the cake. When there is some down time just bring up new hobby and a few moves. That way it's more casual. NTA", " NTA. Your son will be mortified.", "Sorry, I laughed because for 9 year olds? Your son is going to be embarrassed. \nMaybe for her own birthday party. \nNTA", "NTA. She\u2019s trying to make her son\u2019s birthday party all about her! There\u2019s a time and place for it, and his party is not that time. She\u2019s being selfish!", "NTA.\n\nWho in their right mind things that interpretive dance has a place anywhere in civil society, let alone at a kids birthday party!!", "Way to take one for the team. Your wife might think you're TA but you're son and all the guests thank you.", "NTA - As a professional dance teacher, I say this with 20 years of experience teaching ballet, tap, contemporary, and improvisation, NO. His 9th birthday party is not her performance opportunity.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how good she is. It\u2019s not her day. It\u2019s not for him, she\u2019s doing it *for her* and he\u2019s the excuse.\n\nI understand loving movement and dance so much you want to share it, but she needs to be in a recital. My adult friend is performing in a dance recital in February, and I\u2019m lucky enough to now be able to go watch her. His birthday is for him.", "NTA. It\u2019s great she has a hobby, but interpretive dance is one of those hobbies some people will find cool and interesting, and others will find odd and weird. I, myself, would find it very weird and strange. Especially done at a kids party by a parent.", "NTA. Explain to your wife that this is actually your *son\u2019s* big day.", "When I think of interpretive dance, I think of Squidward. So maybe let her do her dance, as long as she wears a full Squidward costume /s. NTA, because the kids are definitely not gonna be into that.", "NTA seems like a sad attempt at getting attention", "NTA. Die on this hill. Someone WILL record that dance. It WILL be posted on social media with accompaniment (the music possibilities are endless, but I\u2019d go side by side with the Elaine dance). It WILL be performed at school. There WILL be nicknames, requests for private performances, and not-so-pleasant calls from other parents.", "Am I missing something? Is she naked? Is this dance sexual or provocative? Or is she just doing a harmless dance at her son's birthday? What exactly is the outrage? She pushed him out 9 years ago, let her do a little jig.", "YTA you have to let her make her own mistake.  who knows, maybe the kids friends might find it funny that their friend\u2019s mom is a weirdo.", "Yep. YTA. She\u2019s an adult, knows the occasion, knows who will be there and understands the potential for embarrassment/regret. If anything perhaps she should talk about it with your son. On that note, I\u2019m curious, your son or y\u2019all\u2019s son?", "I'm not sure any kid wants to see an interpretive dance from their mother at any party. NTA", "And double cringe if the routine is about her love for her son, and triple cringe if it\u2019s about giving birth to her son.", "Oh no... I'm getting more worried now.", "Elaborate\u2026 you know\u2026 for the benefit of OP", "Yeah to be honest I'm not sure where this idea came from. She's been really excited to arrange for a lot of things my son likes for this party so her dance idea was kind of unexpected to me.", "This made me laugh. A ninja dance.", "How dare you imply 9 year olds aren't pseudo-intellectuals!", "If I asked my son his opinion then he would know we were throwing a surprise party :(", "I don't even think you need to qualify it.  It is never a good idea to have interpretive dance.", "As a parent I would lose my composure and have to excuse myself so I could laugh. It wouldn\u2019t help because face would give me away. \n\nImagine, sitting there, a little slice of cake on a tiny paper plate, making small talk, and then the lights dim\u2026..", "I agree with you except to note that her \"hopes and dreams\" don't matter here. As much as I hate adult birthday parties as a rule, maybe she can have one for herself and perform there if she is so desperate to make a spectacle of herself.", "Seriously, I do not care if you need to tackle her to stop this. Do not allow her to embarrass your son in this way at his own party. If she wants to stage a dance routine she can do it at her own party in front of her own friends. NTA.", "I think her class will have a recital a few times a year, IIRC.", "Lmfao what", "100%,  she'll embarrass the fck out of his son and the kids will bully / make fun of him if she does that.", "The best one I saw was the guy who's cousin wanted to do an interpretive dance at his dad's funeral.", "Your son will be teased endlessly.\n\nPlease talk some sense into her.\n\nNTA", "What is this Squidward reference everyone keeps mentioning??", "Right!!! Like NTA it\u2019s not even my party and I am getting secondhand embarrassment. I don\u2019t know which kid would ever enjoy their parent doing any performance, especially dancing at their birthday party. \n\nThis just isn\u2019t the proper setting. Plus it\u2019s the son\u2019s birthday party. The attention should be on him. That\u2019s the whole point of it. I would like to ask OP have you guys spoken to your son about this? He\u2019s 9 years old not 2! All his friends will be there, kids at that age oof. He probably will never live this down. \n\nI think she should let the birthday boy enjoy his party. Maybe your wife can sign up for a recital/talent show, that way, she can get the proper attention, and doing the performance she envisions.", "Huh?", "This 1000 times over.", "I\u2019m crying. Perfect", "She might not be swayed by this if she truly believes she has talent.", "The kids will not care? This is one way to make bulling start.", "I think this would be \"N A H\" not \"N T A\". The former says no one is in the wrong. The latter says that the other person it TA, which I don't think you think the wife is.", "The kids will roast the shit out of him.", "I'm humiliated.   \n\nAnd it hasn't even happened yet/I don't know these people.", "We were trying to keep this party a surprise for him.", "The biggest problem I see is that \"interpretive dance\" is just not entertainment for a 9yo. It's a very different art than other typical dance routines. \n\nI love interpretive dance and I would still feel it was uncomfortably out of place at a 9yos party. Unless the 9yo was performing it. \n\nEntertainment at a kids birthday party should be catered to the birthday child and the guests. Not either of the parents hobbies.", "I'm not trying to have my son embarrassed?", "I imagine it would be embarrassing for the kid, though.", "OR they might bully him mercilessly about it for half past eternity to come. I mean seeing as kids are SOOOO known for being totally cool with letting embarrassing things slide I'm \\*SURE\\* that his friends will all have a sensible chuckle and not use it as ammo for every damn 'your mom' joke to come for the next 4-6 years.", "You think she wants her son's friends to think she's a weirdo?", "I get the sentiment but this is about more than OP\u2019s wife trying and failing at something. Their son\u2019s birthday party is not the appropriate place or time for her to experiment with dance moves she learned on the internet.", "Our son.", "I\u2019m not sure most adults want to see interpretive dance at a party either.", "\u201cTriple cringe if it\u2019s about giving birth to her son\u201d. There must be some kind of extreme punishment available for people who put that kind of image in other people\u2019s minds. \ud83e\udd22", "At least based on the version she performed for me, I don't think the dance is about her relationship with my son.", "Good, don\u2019t put ur son through that", "I'm going to be extremely generous in my interpretation of your wife's intentions, and assume she means it to be a beautiful gift for her son. \n\nProblem is he's a 4th grade boy and they (almost as a rule) do NOT appreciate interpretive dance. Maybe tell her that you understand that she loves her son, but he's likely to be embarrassed. Maybe even bring up the fact that this would have killed you when you were a 9year old boy. Feel free to point out that even if your son is sophisticated enough to appreciate it, his friends likely are not and they *will* tease him, and maybe she should spare her son the slings and arrows of the tiny philistines he goes to school with. \n\nGodspeed, man.", "The answer is no then. If you have the slightest hesitation that this will embarrass your son, on a day you are both working to make special for him, ditch it. Treat this as a two yes, one no type situation.", "Ask her to dance in front of him, to gauge his reaction.  If he thinks it's stupid or embarrassing, she will drop the idea.", "Info: Why is your wife using your sons birthday party to show off?", "Maybe there's a way to get his opinion without giving away the party. If he knows his mom is taking these classes, maybe you could ask him what he thinks of Mom's dancing. \n\nIf you get the idea he thinks it looks fun, or that he likes how happy she is when she's dancing, let it go ahead. If he cringes or kind of laughs and says something about not really understanding it, then the party probably isn't a good time to demonstrate.  \n\nHowever, I think a fun compromise for the kiddos to burn off some energy after cake would be for her to lead a short little \"workshop\" for the kids to try their own hand at interpretive dancing. That might be a fun and memorable way for her to share her hobby while still making it about the birthday boy and his friends.\n\nGood luck to you in this delicate situation. \ud83d\udc9a", "I disagree. It is a hilarious idea when you are at a party with a lot of very drunk professional dancers and you have lost all the beer pong balls. Otherwise, not so much.", "Omg i would not be able to contain myself. \ud83d\ude02\nThere\u2019s a time and a place and this is definitely not it.", "I can\u2019t imagine how embarrassed id feel at 9yo if my mother pulled a stunt like that", "I feel that would be much less embarrassing for the kid", "Yeah I couldn\u2019t agree more!", "Bro, wtf?? I'd like to think my wife would never take it that far.", "I almost mentioned that post in my response. \n\nBut, why do it at all?!", "Squidward, from SpongeBob SquarePants, did interpretive dance and no matter what he did it was terrible and they all hated it. Youtube it", "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFzaaXywPdc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFzaaXywPdc)", "Think you may be wrong in your interpretation. I think they meant exactly what they said.", "Given the situation, I\u2019d say drop the surprise aspect and let him in on what\u2019s going on so he can talk to his mom. Your son might be the only one who can get through to your wife on this issue.", "and he will.  with mom like this, you are fighting a war that you will never win.  it is best to just chill out.", "yeah, it absolutely will.  i feel bad for the husband and the kid.  but what can you do.  the husband is between a rock and a hard place.", "and his mom would be the reason and not him.  I still feel like OP should chill out and let the mom destroy his son\u2019s life.  you know that stupid saying, \u201chappy wife, happy life.\u201d", "i can honestly say that she did not think this through.  she just wanted to show off her new toys \u2026 like a child.", "i agreed.  i also know not to try put sanity in crazy.", "Even more of a reason to ask your wife \"wtf are you doing\". I mean does she always throw herself in the center of attention during other people's events?", "I can only promise that no matter what happens, you are gonna wind up with an unhappy family member.  Enjoy.  Sorry.", "Can't wait for this poor child's future wedding. *Chewing gum*", "Thanks for the laugh from your original comment. Although I blame you for making me spit out my Coke.", "I dunno man, she's willing to humiliate your son at his own birthday party just so she can be the center of attention. How would she feel about someone doing this at her birthday party?", "Is there another way to convince my wife without involving my son? My son has always loved surprise parties for other people and this is our first year throwing one for him.", "Possibly bringing up this exact point: your son loves surprises and you don\u2019t want to ruin this, but there\u2019s no way to accurately gauge his comfort level before hand and it\u2019s too big of a risk", "You could probably feel out how he\u2019d feel about his mom doing a dance in front of his friends without bringing up the context of a birthday party.", "If your wife won't listen to reason without bringing your son into it all you would be doing would be ruining the surprise and putting him in a terrible position at the same time. If he is a sensitive kid he won't want to say no to his mother.", "Good point!"]}
