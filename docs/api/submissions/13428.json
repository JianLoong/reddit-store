My (M37) wife (F25) recently decided to become vegan, and while I  respected her dietary choices, I have to admit she's become much more obnoxious after becoming vegan. She constantly goes on about \"how good the vegan life is\", how much skinnier and better she feels, and tries to convince me to join her no matter how many times I decline. However, things took a turn for the worse when they decided to steal my car to attend a vegan protest.\n\nSo, here's what happened: I had lent my car to my wife and she promised to bring it back by the next day. However, time went by without a trace of my car and I started getting worried for her. I tried to look up her social media, only to see her lapping it up with some vegan friends at a protest.  I finally managed to get in touch with her and she informed me that she had indeed taken my car to go to a protest against a restaurant that served meat.\n\nI was absolutely livid. Not only had she taken my car without my permission, but she had also put her self and my car in harm's way by driving to a protest. When I confronted her about this, she got snarky and condescending, and started lecturing me on the importance of animal rights and the environmental impact of meat-eating.\n\nBut things got even worse when she started blowing up my phone with calls and texts, trying to guilt-trip me into supporting her cause. She accused me of being selfish and not caring about the planet, and that I was the problem. It was like she was trying to justify her actions by making me feel guilty.\n\nI tried to keep my cool and calmly explained to her that stealing someone's car was never okay, regardless of their beliefs. But she just wouldn't listen. Instead, she continued to berate me for not being vegan, and how my food choices were contributing to climate change.\n\nAt this point, I had had enough. I raised my voice and told her that she was a \"selfish bratty vegan elitist\" and her behavior was completely unacceptable, and that she needed to return my car immediately. My wife refused to listen to me and said that she was doing what was right for the planet.\n\nShe still hasn't returned the car after 2 days, and the situation has left me feeling betrayed and angry. Now I'm left wondering, AITA in this situation?", "created_utc": 1680038038, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1252k5m/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_vegan_wife/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
