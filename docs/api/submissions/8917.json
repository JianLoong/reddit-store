You're his mom, not his girlfriend.\" And she said something along the lines of \"yeah, I'm his mom so I should come first\" I just laughed and called her delusional.

Your brother's an adult, and he's perfectly capable of making his own decisions. It's good that he wants to be more independent and form a healthy romantic relationship. Your mom is not only showing an unhealthy dependance on him, she's trying to weaken his current relationship with all this.

Sure but this is NOT one of those situations where you were unnecessarily rude making you correct but still an asshole.

Your sister wasn't told the whole story is wait a day for her to chill out and call your sister and explain exactly what happened.\n\n I imagine your mom is a religious conservative? If so and your sister is too, it's all too common for then to try to control their adult children's romantic lives. I had my dad try it with me. Was even older at 34 and was home visiting my brother set me up and he told me no joke i had to be back by midnight or i would be locked out....I ended up staying at her house just to spite him.

Plus, her asking about his sex life like that is just out there.  It was something she needed to hear about respecting boundaries.", "NTA. You're absolutely right.

Mom has a bit of a creepy \"hug them till they love me, or can't breathe\" take on life. Makes me think her name should be HuggyWuggy actually. You were 100% right to back your brother up.
