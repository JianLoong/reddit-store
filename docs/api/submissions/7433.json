Not liking her is really the icing on the cake, and you shouldn't have to explain yourself to them.", "NTA\n\nI vehemently oppose any work functions/practices that cost employees money. I wouldn\u2019t care if this person was Mother Teresa, you don\u2019t have to contribute shit. You and everyone else are there to make money and no one understands your personal finances. I hated this when I was a low level employee and supporting a family of four on my one small income. If Bossman, who probably make considerably more money than everyone they are asking money from wants to make the pot something substantial, they can do that all by themselves.", "NTA. don't give your hard earned money to a known abuser, and shame on your boss and co-workers for trying to strong arm you into donating.", "NTA\n\nMost even slightly honourable employers would have a budget to expense things like condolence flower arrangements and have the company pay for it on behalf of everyone at the organization. \n\nIt's shitty, and in poor taste, to expect employees to contribute financially to something like that, and moreso since you can't ensure a standard budget every time to make all employees feel equally supported in their time of grief.", "NTA.

I wouldn\u2019t contribute to anyone who\u2019s cruel \u2014 I just contribute to those I\u2019m close to but will sign a card for anyone halfway decent.

Always voluntary, never compulsory, no excuse or reason required for donating or not.", "NTA.  Don't let others bully you into anything.  If they want to contribute that is up to them.  You are under no obligation to do so.  I have never contributed for a work colleague that I don't know very well, or don't like - you can work with people and not like them - they don't have to be your friends.  \n\nAre these people keeping a tally of who put in what?  That is really petty.", "NTA in the sense that you are not a hypocrite!  But you will LOOK like the AH to other coworkers\u2026.so it\u2019s probably not worth the grief.  Might be worth a couple dollars just to not be labeled.", "NTA. My work place does this all the time and it\u2019s so annoying.

You're not an asshole for your actions but everyone at work is currently thinking that you are because to them you didn't participate in a kind gesture for a fellow employee and they feel cheated by you.

Perception is the reality unfortunately. Most people don't view a death like that as the time to check the tally to see if they are deserving of sympathy or not.", "Personally, I think it makes OP look intransigent. Which is fine, and I admire their ability to ignore workplace politicking, especially since their coworker is a real piece of work. But, they already know that it's caused people to talk shit about them. (To be clear, those other coworkers are giant assholes, and I support OP, but it *does* make them look unsupportive of their coworkers.)", "I get it. I like promotions, though.", "the money isn't going to the person.  The company is sending flowers in appreciation and understanding a human being just lot their parent.", "Because that\u2019s the example given? What does this person gain from not contributing? A smug self esteem that they one upped someone mourning the lost of a parent. There\u2019s other times to find your hill to die on. This isn\u2019t one. Plus, it\u2019ll have ramifications on other colleagues opinions of OP, 100%. It\u2019s a no win situation.", "But it's also none of their business what OP does with their money. If they feel so bad for their coworker, they can fork out money. None of them know what OP is paying for. Maybe they pay for their ailing parents' medical bills, etc. \n\nMy point is, who the fuck cares about the perception of shitty people? They don't matter. They don't pay OPs bill. Therefore, their coworker is entitled to jack imo. This isn't a charity this is a place to perform work.", "So do I. I've gotten 3 in 8 months. Because I just work, I don't fuck with office politics.", "That makes zero sense. Money is leaving OP\u2019s pocket, doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a cash gift or flowers. \n\nThe company can buy the flowers themselves if they want to do this. Or bossman can do it himself.", "They gain the money they keep", "That\u2019s a good point, what do they gain from contributing? What\u2019s she being smug about, not contributing to something for someone they don\u2019t like? What if someone couldn\u2019t afford it? Are they gonna get bashed because they aren\u2019t contributing? No one, NO ONE is entitled to your money, and if someone\u2019s gonna have a bad opinion of you for not giving to someone for whatever reason, that\u2019s their problem.", "The perception doesn't matter at all if if doesn't bother you. I don't think we have a problem telling coworkers \"nah, i don't like her  im good\" but clearly OP does because they are asking about their situation. In OPs situation it might be better to just pitch in a few dollars because they care about the opinions of the other coworkers.", "It\u2019s the contribution more than the financial aspect. You could put a dollar in and still have contributed.", "Fair point. I also think it's good for them to know that they shouldn't necessarily care about their thoughts. As long as you work hard and keep your nose clean, you should be OK. OP may be considered an asshole at the work place, but in a sane world, they're acting perfectly normal.", "The boss who makes more could contribute that dollar in her name, but that didn't happen either.", "But why does she have to contribute?

I hate those kinds of things.", "It doesn't say anywhere the job demanded it it says coworkers were hinting at it. Huge difference.

Boss needs some manager training.", "That's not really relevant to my judgment, though - it's possible that this wasn't a good move by the manager and OP is still TA, even though it was a bad move by the manager. \n\nAlso, \"the company\" isn't \"coercing\" employees with social stigma - certain employees of the company are resentful of OP's refusal to pitch in as part of the team. OP is free to say no, and OP's coworkers are free to judge that choice. It's called \"consequences,\" and actions have them. \n\nThe question wasn't whether or not OP had the right to say no. Of course OP had that right. \n\nThe question was whether or not OP was TA for saying no, and I say yes, OP was TA for refusing to pitch in with the rest of the team.", "No, manager asking for \u201cdonations\u201d in a manner that it will be publicly known if everyone in office does it is so inappropriate that OP is absolved completely. He should not donate money under social pressure at all, especially in a work environment. For some employees, the spare $10 could be food off the table. Managers need to understand this and not create situations where employees feel pressured to spend money. That\u2019s just EOD.\n\nFurthermore, no one is actually an asshole simply because a handful of people have unfair expectations, that is a major point of this sub.", "You are correct. But practically speaking this could cost OP much more in the long run. It sucks, but if the others decided she's not deserving of their help at work, or worse, decided to ding them in some way, they could find it would have been worth it. It's wrong but it happens a lot. One just has to be prepared for the fallout.", "nta", "Nta. Your work is gross for asking staff to pay. They should do it themselves and just pass a card around for staff to sign.", "NTA about the flowers \n\nBUT\n\nIf you have a co-worker who is cruel to patients, 1.) this should be reported not only to the head of the facility and 2.)  the State licensing board for your type of facility in writing with a description of specific incidents\n\nAND\n\n3.) if the patients are elderly, you should have made an elderly abuse report.\n\n4.) if the patients are children, you should have made a child abuse report.\n\n5.) if the patients are dependent adults, you should have made a dependent adults report.\n\nIf you have not done 1-2, as well as doing 3, 4, or 5 if appropriate, you are complicit in cruelty to patients, and Y worse than TA.", "Gonna say NTA. It sucks that her mother died, but if she wouldn't put in for you, I wouldn't feel obligated to put in for her.", "NTA \n\nTell them you're not in a spot financially where you can do this.

If the boss wants to send flowers, the company should pay, not the employees.", "I'll take my lumps from the users here but I'm going against the grain with soft YTA. \n\nI was always raised that there are certain things that should trump personal grievances - like the death of a family member. I'm not saying you have to chip in much. It isn't about the amount. It's about the death of someone's loved one being the wrong time to take a personal stance due to not particularly caring for the coworker.\n\nAn almost identical scenario happened to me at an old workplace - a lady I didn't like and did not respect lost someone close to her. I signed her card. I pitched my $5. But I didn't like her any more afterward. I was raised to offer condolences when someone experiences a loss - regardless of my personal feelings.\n\n\nLook, at the end of the day it's your money and you get to choose how you spend it. I just don't think this was the right time or the right hill on which to make your stand.\n\nTL;DR: soft YTA", "NTA", "NTA. Your money your choice.", "NTA put ten cents in the pot and all it a day", "NTA what they are doing is a choice not a necessary thing. I wouldn\u2019t worry about what others think of you. Besides if this boss actually gave a fuck about the employees they would pay for the \u201cgift\u201d with company funds and write it off..", "NTA. I have had similar conflicts about contributions for coworkers I do not respect, so in a case like this, I would toss a $5 in. Why? To maintain my sanity in a herd environment where nasty coworkers not only keep track, but they report to others. Your boss is TA.", " YTA, I had a coworker I disliked immensely but I still contributed to a fund for flowers for her in a similar situation.    It is called empathy.   Granted I didn't donate a lot but I did donate something because in the end it is just a way of saying \"I am sorry for  your loss\".   I assume your personal feelings for her don't mean you are happy her mother died.    If a coworker mentioned it to you, it is obvious that your attitude is being noticed in the office and will do nothing but influence their opinions of you in the future.", "This - I would have given $5 as a \"keep the peace\" fee and moved on with my life. This wasn't a battle worth picking. And, right or wrong, OP has to continue to work with these people. Just sayin'...", "Yeah. If you don't give a damn, that's one thing, but op cares about his coworkers opinions"]}
