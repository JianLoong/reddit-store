Misery may love company but it has no right to expect others to miss sleep repetitively", "NTA. I understand how frustrating it is to have someone sleeping peacefully next to you when you can\u2019t sleep yourself, but if it bothers him that much maybe y\u2019all can sleep in separate rooms. There is no point in you losing sleep every night for years to no purpose.", "NTA - I have chronic pain as well as insomnia, but I would never expect my spouse to join me in my misery and wake up every time I do.", "Nta. It\u2019s unfortunate he can\u2019t sleep, but if you can\u2019t help why is your sleep supposed to suffer? As someone who loves you, he shouldn\u2019t want what he is going through for you in any way. His stance on this is weird.", "NTA. So basically he thinks that you are selfish because he's miserable so you should be too.", "NTA. Everyone needs their sleep", "NTA\n\nI would tell him that the alternative is separate bedrooms. I'd also suggest that he and his doctor should review treatment options for his chronic pain if they haven't done so recently.", "Absolutely NTA. You deserve your sleep. It's unfortunate that he's in pain, bur you being awake doesn't change a darn thing. \n\nBUT I would sleep in a different room before using medications. Sleep meds have side effects (like all medications) and you don't want to be on them if you don't need to be.

So now you're trying a different method. Also I might suggest having separate beds. Unless there's a health reason why you shouldn't be taking the sleep aid that would be the only reason I would see for not taking it. When you're around someone who has a chronic illness the feeling I'm helplessness and the inability to make it better can be very frustrating and wearing on your nerves I definitely recommend talking with someone because they're probably going to have some different coping ideas you haven't thought of as well as it's a great place to be able to vent. And definitely you can recommend that for your significant other as well because whether you're around them or you're the person with the illness chronic pain can actually really wear on your emotional health.", "NTA - I have multiple autoimmune degenerative disease all of which cause lots of pain and I cannot sleep through the night either but I also realize that my partner shouldn\u2019t be denied sleep cause I\u2019m in pain - for us we started sleeping in different rooms on nights where we have work the next morning so that way he may get the sleep he needs and I can move as much as I need while trying to get comfortable", "NTA. What kind of parner would begrudge you sleep when there is nothing you can do for them?", "NTA... when my dramatic partner did this, I would offer to take him to the hospital. \nI've dealt with chronic pain all my life and recently some very intense exhausting pain I was hospitalized for. I got home and couldn't get out of pain so I let husband sleep in bedroom while I stayed up all night in the living room.... \nIf there is nothing they can do, then they should sleep so they have the resources to help out the next day.", "NTA but he needs to go to the dr", "NTA. Why doesn't he take the sleeping aid himself to help him sleep thru the pain?", "NTA\n\nI have chronic pain and get strong sedating medication so I'm able to sleep because otherwise the pain keeps me awake. Even in my worst nights I don't expect anyone to stay awake with me. It's not fair to take away someone else's sleep especially since they can't help. \n\nYour situation actually reminded me of a dispute I had with my mom this summer. One of my chronic pains comes in phases. Currently I am relatively fine regarding that pain (while writing this with an ice pack on my head for another chronic pain because painkillers don't work today), but in summer it was bad. So bad I was prescribed opiates (rare in my country). Since I was too ill to take care of myself and my dog I was with my mom. I gotta admit I enjoyed that she would apply pain ointment on my joints and rotate the ice packs for me as the movement required to do so hurt, but I never expect it.  She woke up one night to see and saw me reading on my phone. She asked why I was awake and I said the pain kept me awake trough my sleeping meds and I'm waiting for it to fade enough to fall asleep. She was annoyed I hadn't woken her up to comfort me and help with ointment, rotating ice packs and just being there for me. The thought hadn't even crossed my mind as she deserves to sleep as well. \n\nThe idea of wanting someone to be awake for me, especially if they can't even do anything for me is strange. The modus operandi when all my pain flares up at once and my mom or my best friend take care of me is the following: before the first of us goes to sleep (with my mom it's her because she works early, with my friend it's me because he's a night owl) I think about what I need for the night (refill of my water bottle, ice pack, heating pad, check if I have all emergency medication at hand, is there a bucket on days I don't trust my stomach?) and they make sure it's all taken care of (which I see as a luxury, usually I take care of that myself). Then I fend for myself during the night. I think I needed help (outside of the hospital) at night 5 times since I became an adult: once shortly before I was diagnosed with general asthma (only was diagnosed with allergic asthma at the time) I had an attack at night and wasn't able to get up for my inhaler which was in my purse as I had only needed it outside and in spring so far and it was winter. Once after my diagnosis I forgot to put my inhaler near my bed and had a bad attack at night. Both times my mom was at my place and helped me out. Once I had a little breakdown because I was exhausted from weeks of extreme pain and I knew while late my mom was still up so I called her and she calmed me down until the emergency medication kicked in. And two nights in a row while my best friend was with me I woke him up to get me my inhaler. I hadn't had night attacks for months at that time and wasn't prepared. So we searched for the cause and it turned out he had accidentally caused mold to grow near my bed. That's it. I'm almost thirty z severely chronically ill with several pain conditions and that's the amount of me taking away from the nights of my loved ones.", "NTA as a person with Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition, your husband is super selfish. I went through a year when I would sleep for 2 to 3 hours every 48 to 72hours and never did I try wake people up to pamper me or be sleep deprived along with me. I did everything I had to to be kinder to myself, get the diagnosis and get some rest. He needs professional help and nothing you do can get him that, he has to do it on his own. I know the scariest thing is knowing your body is trying to kill you but that is not your fault and he should check himself and communicate better", "NAH.\n\nI have chronic pain and sometimes you just need someone there for you. \n\nThis is all about compromise. When my partner was alive and this happened to me, if I woke her up she\u2019d make sure I was ok then when I knew there was nothing more she could do I would go sleep on the couch. \n\nHas he spoken to his GP about a correct pain medication management plan? On top of the tramadol I take I also have pregablin which acts as a nerve stimulant which helps me sleep.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
