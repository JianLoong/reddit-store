I (25w) come from a diverse family background. My mom is half Japanese half indigenous Amazonian (She's from Brazil) and my dad is a 2nd gen Dominican-American. My parents met because my mom was an exchange student in America. They fell in love, got married in Brazil, and moved there. I am fluent in Brazilian Portuguese and English. I visited my dads family in Florida every summer growing up. I have two siblings. My sister Alya(29w) and my other sister Maria. Maria died in a car crash when she was 19 4 years ago. It is the hardest thing I've ever experienced in my life. She was such a blessing to me and her death was completely out   nowhere. Fast forward to today : I live in the US with my wife and Alya lives back in Brazil, taking care of our parents. We have two graves : one in Brazil and one in America. I moved to the US last year for extra context so this makes more sense. Maria's anniversary was two days ago and I hit up all my family asking if they wanted to go. They all said that they're super busy with work, or that they're sick. I understood and visited her grave with my wife and spent the day doing the things that she loved. Then I was talking to a friend who knows our family about it and said something along the lines of : \"Yeah I was super disappointed that my family couldn't make it because they were all super busy with work or were sick. She gave me a look and asked what I was talking about. I told her that that's why they couldn't make it and she said that's not true. I asked her about it and she said they hosted a graduation party for my cousin (he graduated last week) on her anniversary. I thought she was just confused until she showed me photos that her sister took from the party because her sister is friends with my cousin. I was in shock and texted my family asking what tf this was about and they all started getting defensive and when I asked my aunt she just said that Maria's anniversary was the perfect date for the party since no one was busy that day and that its not that big of a deal. I asked her if she even cared about her and she blocked me. I told Alya, my wife, and my parents who all were super angry and got the same response. I'm now getting hateful messaged from everyone including family friends calling me sensitive and being a jerk for not understanding that that is the way they grieve. I'm just mad that they all lied to me and couldn't spare half an hour at her grave.

No, you were totally justified in blowing up at them for lying to you. That is low.\n\nBut at the same time, everyone grieves differently so if the choose not to go to her grave you must accept that too. \n\nHow would you have handled them telling you the truth about why the were not going?", "NTA. It' not the grieving process or if they even wanted to go to the grave with you.  It's the blatant lie they told knowing they were doing something wrong.    If they didn't feel it was wrong they would have straight up told you and invited you.", "You were being lied to.\n\nAnd to make sure the lie didn't come out, you were also not invited to your cousin's graduation party.\n\nYour family is sure lacking in communication skills.\n\nAnd now the truth has come out, they're angry.\n\nThey should have been honest from the beginning.\n\nNTA", "Soft--very soft--ESH.  Your family sucks for lying to you about their plans.  But you also suck for expecting your family to grieve the same way you grieve.     \n\n\nI don't visit graves.  I hate the entire concept of visiting a monument to what is left of my loved one's body.   I have family who spend hours multiple times a year visiting and decorating those graves, and that's great for them.  I'm glad it brings them peace.  But it does not bring ME peace to do that.  I honor my loved ones who have passed by acts of service in their name, usually on special occasions like their birthday.  That's what works for me.     \n\n\nYour family should not have lied to you.   That was an AH move.  But you also need to stop expecting them to grieve YOUR way.   We all deal with losing a loved one in different ways, and judging others for doing it differently than you makes you an AH.", "Eh I hate to say it but YTA - like everyone else is saying, people grieve in their own ways. You can\u2019t expect someone to feel or express the way you do, so getting upset when they aren\u2019t acting just like you are is setting yourself up for failure. It\u2019ll be easier on you once you understand ppl (even family) are all not the same, and you have to let them do whatever they please even if you don\u2019t agree with it", "ESH.\n\nGrieve as you like, but don't force other people to do it your way.  For me, their approach is much more understandable because I think the living ones are more important than the dead ones. I am sorry for your loss, it must have been awful, but you have no right to tell other people how - and if at all - they should grieve.\n\nThey are AHs for the hateful messages, and a bit for lying to you but be honest with yourself - how much would you have pestered them if you knew they just DO NOT WANT TO GO, which is what they did.\n\nAnd the \"friend\" is the most stupid AH for telling you.", "NTA..I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your sister and that your family was dishonest with you plus didn\u2019t invite you to a family event.

They are FINE to move on and NOT visit the grave any more. YOU will have to learn to accept that. Get some therapy.", "I\u2019m so sorry this happened to your family. Your friend is the ah. It was not her place to open her mouth. \n\nYour family is going to be defensive because they don\u2019t want you to judge them or think badly of them. I\u2019m guessing they couldn\u2019t be honest with you because they didn\u2019t want to hurt your feelings. They did the exact opposite. Hurt you more.\n\nGrief & loss are the most challenging feelings to process. Everyone has to move at their own pace & being accepting of others. You all suffered through an enormous tragedy. Sadly, there\u2019s nothing that can be done to bring your sister back. Her life should be honored by your family graciously living your lives in harmony filled with happiness & joy.\n\nI\u2019m truly sorry for your loss.\n\nNAH (except your friend)", "NTA. The lying is definitely bad. I personally understand not everyone grieving the same way, but why not just explain the situation. I personally don't put much stock in specific anniversary days, but only because I view it as more of a reminder to set aside time, so in this instance I don't see why they couldn't have explained and maybe compromised by setting aside time on a different day so the family could do a remembrance together. Definitely could have been handled better had they been honest from the get go", "ESH. YTA for blowing up. They should have told the truth. People grieve in their own way. I never go to Graves sites. I find it pointless. You get comfort from it, so go as often as you want. Others aren't wrong for not going. I'm sorry for your loss.", "YTA. Everyone grieves differently, and that's not up to you. It's incredibly selfish to try and guilt people into grieving your way and asking \"do you even care about her?\". I lost my dad 5 years ago and haven't gone to visit his grave, it's just not my thing. I go fishing around that day and enjoy the morning thinking about him. I have family members who just take the day to relax and think about him. I have other family members who go on like it didn't happen, and that's all fine!", "NTA: they lied because they KNOW they\u2019re wrong. Don\u2019t try to get an explanation, they\u2019re actions are explanation enough. Live life knowing selfish, disrespectful, and inconsiderate people such as themselves are no longer in your life, your better off without them. Life has a way of teaching us lessons and one day their inconsiderate disrespect will come back to bite them", "NTA I was hoping they lied to you to protect your feelings but in regards to their responses, they obviously don't give a fuck about that. Sorry for your lost, pick a page in your aunt playbook and block them all. Give yourself time to process your feelings.", "NTA. The definitely should not have lied to you but I think there's a reason why they did. They know how seriously you take the anniversary and likely didn't want to hurt or offend you by telling you they were hosting a party. They were celebrating a milestone and while you say you would have understood I wonder if they believe you would have reacted much differently. Turns out trying to spare any hurt feelings actually hurt you more. Your feelings are justified and they're trying to diminish them.\n\nNO ONE should be attacking you over it. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA for being upset that they lied and were insensitive. Maybe going to a grave does nothing for them or they don't want to observe that day every year but they knew it was a thing for you. They should have been honest.\n\nMy husband's sibling died at 19 over 10 years ago and it still impacts our family. It was so shocking and sad for a young life to be cut short suddenly.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "Wait. That\u2019s how they grieve? By throwing a graduation party? If they didn\u2019t want to come they should have just said so instead of lying. My guess is that they will pretend that they wanted to protect your feelings, which is bs. They lied because they didn\u2019t have the guts to tell the truth.", "Wait\u2026so They are really trying to say that THROWING A GRADUATION PARTY Is HOW They \u201cGrieve\u201d???? I have Lost MANY Family members in my life, some Extremely Close (2 Moms, GreatNan & Bestie) and some Not so close & I have NEVER ONCE Done or Heard such a thing!!! Unless it was the Deceased\u2019s Wishes..Ex: I plan to have No Funeral or Viewing, just an Irish Wake after I\u2019m Cremated.

When people send you their hateful messages inform them to please respect your period of mourning because they are dead to you and the funeral is tomorrow. Lol", "Everyone grieves differently.  I would say you are in a different stage pf grief than the rest of your family.\n\nPeople are allowed to move on.\n\nThis was your sister, but she was a cousin, a niece, to the family in the US.\n\nThey should not have lied to you.\n\nESH", "I'm just mad they lied to me about it. If they were up front it would've been a little better.", "They were not doing anything wrong.

They probably care more about their own closer living family than to visit a more distant relative's grave. And this is perfectly normal.\n\nOP - if they were being honest they may have told you something along the line \"no, we are not going, we already have other plans (we are having a graduation party)\".  Be honest to yourself - what would you have done if they did this? If your reaction would have been other than \"ok, understood\", I do not wonder they wanted to avoid this.", "Unrelated but I find Irish wakes beautiful.

Or would you have told them they were being awful by celebrating on a day they should be mourning?", "No offense but your reaction does  not indicate that you would take it well if your relatives had told you they weren't visiting your sister's grave to throw a graduation party. Also, and I say this with much sympathy, a sister is not the same as a niece/cousin you only saw once a year on visits; much as I am sure they loved your sister, it's not unusual that 4 years on, they wouldn't be still grieving as you do. I am also confused about the two graves; you seem to think because you moved to the US it's normal to have a second grave, but it really isn't? Do you mean some other kind of memorial? Is it possibly something that your US family aren't familiar with?", "This is something you are rightfully annoyed for. And for their nasty comments afterwards.\n\nYou have no right to be annoyed because they did not want to go to the grave, or because they did not invite you to the graduation. \n\nIf you wanted to give them grief JUST for lying and being nasty to you, I'd say NTA because I would feel you'd be right. But you are insinuating they are somehow wrong for not wanting to go to the grave and having a party instead, and this is something they are perfectly entitled to.", "It\u2019s not the way in which they\u2019re grieving but the lies. If they were doing something in their own way, they\u2019d just come out and say it. The fact that they lied, especially regarding something as deep as a grievance shows that they know they\u2019re wrong and there\u2019s an element of guilt there. Even if they knew that OP wouldn\u2019t attend the graduation, if you know there\u2019s no malice or ill intent you\u2019d be honest. Lies and deceit are usually evidence of a guilty conscience", "I mean I definitely would have been more understanding. I'd feel sad for sure because I like to do things with family on her anniversary but not as angry as I am rn.", "Alternatively his reaction could come from having to repeat this exact comment nonstop all over the post. No offense of course", "Not always.\n\nI agree that ideally we should all be honest with each other (and it is much easier too, above all for those of us who do not have the best memory because it is a pain in the ass to remember all the lies.) \n\nBut if people do lie, it does absolutely not always mean they do it because they know they are wrong and they feel rightfully guilty. It may also be because they think what they did is OK but the other person is unreasonable and will cause drama, and they want to avoid that.", "If you\u2019re upset because they lied then ask them why they did that. They lied to you. They have a reason.\n\nQuestioning their loss & feelings about your sister is definitely not okay. It is not about her. She\u2019s not here & your family is not to blame for that. This is about you. No one did anything to harm your sister.", "But in the circumstance when the issue is regarding a bereavement, the lie is far worse than the truth. This isn\u2019t some small white lie, they legit celebrated someone else whilst lying as to why they wouldn\u2019t participate in the grievance of another. Them celebrating the graduation isn\u2019t the issue, it\u2019s them lying about it THEN, they blocked all the family members of the one who passed when confronted. That seems a bit shady and questionable. If you\u2019re remorseful and it was all about avoiding drama, when confronted you\u2019d apologise for any hurt feelings and explain that you didn\u2019t want your choice to be perceived wrong or for any feelings to be hurt, you wouldn\u2019t block out your family members that are still grieving the death of their daughter/sister. That\u2019s where things start to get questionable.", "They said its because they wanted a better reason and also didn't want me to show up to the party with my wife which is wouldn't have don't anyways.", "Yes, I agree with you in this.\n\nNot grieving and celebrating instead - OK\n\nLying about it - not OK\n\nGetting aggressive and blocking people - definitely not OK", "Why would they think you would show up to the party  if they did not invite you?", "Appears there are other issues here. I\u2019m confused if your family is in Brazil how would you just show up? \n\nRegardless, if you want to spend the day in honor of Maria that is your choice. Your family is allowed to honor her in other ways. You all have that choice. You made the day about you, your family did nothing to dishonor Maria. This happened to all of you. You all suffered this horrible loss. It\u2019s not a competition of who cares more about Maria. \n\nShe was loved by many & her loss is felt by many. Celebrating another person\u2019s achievements on the day she died is not disrespectful. It\u2019s understanding that life moves forward. No one can change what has happened, but people can find peace in their happy, loving & wonderful memories of Maria. Do whatever you want to honor her memory & give people grace to honor her as they choose.", "NTA\nThe aunt was very much an a-hole and cruel. If she knew the day was set aside from work for grieving, then used that to divert local family members to her convenience, that's some pretty cold hearted manipulation.\n\nHonoring the dead is specific to each bereaved person. It's okay if OPs wife wants to practice an annual tradition in memory of their sister. It's okay if other relatives, even close ones, chose to go on with their lives while still grieving the loss. It's not okay to harshly judge or invalidate someone else's way of dealing with loss and grieving.\n\nI'd hesitate to judge anyone beyond the aunt, whose own words show her cruelty, manipulation and selfishness. The other family members may not have been thinking her way at all.", "NTA, I think your family should've done something to remember your sister if they didn't want to visit the grave.  I believe you behaved in a way anyone would if they were in the situation.", "Gentle ESH. I get how you feel, and you\u2019ve got every right to be angry that they lied to you (which is the part that makes them assholes), but you don\u2019t get to dictate the time frame and way that other people grieve. Accusing someone of not caring about a dead family member because they didn\u2019t grieve the same way you did is a LOW blow, and a hard one to take back once the fight is over and people have calmed down. Accusing your family of not caring about the loss of your sister is a scorched earth kind of move and I don\u2019t think the situation called for it."]}
