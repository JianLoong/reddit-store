She was a bully. A few times she would actively tell me when she was planning to take attention from me on my birthday or my graduation. She was like that with our cousins as well. Sometimes it was getting attention on her and getting whoever's birthday it was in trouble. She made up so many lies about us. So I ended up low contact with them (her and my parents) as adults. I know from my cousins she hasn't changed at all.

Can you imagine being a family member of one of the grooms, who has no clue who the other groom is, let alone their family, and having to attend a party to celebrate them? And this isn't an ordinary party; it's a wedding.\n\nIf you were ever friendly with one of a set of twins growing up, and you were invited to a joint birthday party and didn't know if you should bring a gift for the twin you weren't friends with, it's like that, only worse.", "Possibilities:\n\n1. All of our relatives will want to come to my wedding instead of OP's, and she'll be hurt.\n\n2. All of our relatives will want to come to my wedding instead of OP's, and she'll be forced to postpone her wedding.\n\n3. OP will be afraid that all of our relatives will want to come to my wedding instead of hers, so she will agree to a double wedding, And I will hardly have to pay for anything.", "Can I add maybe if you can change the date to a closer date and not tell anyone till last min ( that\u2019s petty me talking lol)", "My petty side would \"let it slip out\" that you changed the date to a new day so you wouldn't have to compete  with sister and the new day is better anyway.  Let it seem like it really has been moved. Only let those you invited and trust know the date is the same.   Sister might actually change her wedding date because how dare you yoi choose a better date than hers.", "I agree, I have seen people suggest putting a password on all vendors, having \"security\" ready to escort people out etc", "They weren\u2019t even welcome at the party they want to steal? Thank you for sharing the story but I\u2019m not sure how you could possibly doubt that you haven\u2019t done anything wrong.", "I would also hire security and gave them pictures of people who were not supposed to be there and also instructed to kick out anyone except you wearing a wedding gown. Edit: clarifying", "Are the adults ok in the head like they actually think you\u2019re the bully for not sharing your wedding with the golden me me me baby? WTFFFFFF", "Right like why not the next day or day before. It\u2019s just giving off weird energy. It sounds just like she said her sister is the mean girl. What do mean girls do in movies? Have a sleepover the same night as the \u201cunderdog\u201d to get all the attention", "Why do you think sis picked the same date? Still bent on attention for her and disappointment for OP", "This!", "You haven't lived until you've watched Sportsball.", "In my 4th grade class, in 1982, my teacher told us that there was going to be a sequel to the movie ET, and it was going to be called ETC.\n\nHe had us going for a minute, and the joke had to be explained to some of the classmates (hey, we were 10), but it's still how I remember it.", "It stands for et cetera so that\u2019s an easy to remember as well.", "Oh, they do.\n\nThey just want to save time and money on the invitation and the revenue and the food and welll... Everything, while sis continues to do what she does best - attempting to hog all the attention.\n\nFlying monkeys - \"Neither sister, nor parents are invited to the wedding. She can marry her partner on the same they if she wants, I wish the best of luck to the guy. I'll be sad if you withdrew from attending mine to go to hers, but I'll understand, hope you have fun. She deserves a day whole to herself, not having to worry about being compared to someone else, unperturbed by there being another wedding going on in her vicinity, and so I'll just keep my wedding where it's at, the time it's at, with myself, my husband, the officiant, and my guests present.\n\nThat said, are you out of your mind? Or maybe you'd like to divorce Uncle Dan so that sister could have her double wedding, because I sure ain't sharing mine.\"\n\nAlternatively.\n\n\"Yes, I'm a bully. Can I still expect you to come, or should I update the seating chart?...Auntie Marigold, we just discussed, I'm a bully, yes, I'm just waiting for you to confirm or refuse your attendance at *my* wedding.\"", "Like who does that? All of the family members should have pounced on her for pulling such an asshole move. NTA OP, your sister definitely is though.", "Probably wants a free wedding as well.", "ABSOLUTELY!", "Love it!", "That totally makes sense. I was also thinking that maybe she just assumed OP would fold under pressure from the family, have the \"double wedding,\" and she'd be able to use OP to pay for absolutely everything while taking over the actual wedding herself. It definitely sounds like she's accustomed to getting her way.\n\nEither way, she's definitely double delusional... she wasn't even INVITED to OP's wedding but she thinks they're going to share?! Loooool. I hope OP goes completely no contact with sister, parents, and any other relatives trying to push this nonsense.", "Parents and sister are going to crash OP's wedding in their wedding finery. Get security. Everyone who is attacking you should be said, \"It's settled then, you have a great time at sister's wedding. I'll update my guest list.\""]}
