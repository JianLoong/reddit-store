She was a bully. A few times she would actively tell me when she was planning to take attention from me on my birthday or my graduation. She was like that with our cousins as well. Sometimes it was getting attention on her and getting whoever's birthday it was in trouble. She made up so many lies about us. So I ended up low contact with them (her and my parents) as adults. I know from my cousins she hasn't changed at all.
