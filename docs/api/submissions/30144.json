I proposed in our pink costumes. \nWe did an impromptu photo shoot at the party because everyone was so excited for us. We got some really great pics. \n\nHowever the issue came with my sister who lives with my parents and has a 6 month old baby. It was an issue in our family because she\u2019s unwed and the man didn\u2019t stick around. \nMy sister and then even my mom became nasty when she found out the price of the ring saying I should have got something cheaper and helped out my sister more. They complained about the prices of diapers, formula and child care. \nI helped when I could but I have been saving up for this ring forever and my focus was getting that because I know Kay\u2019s family is traditional so her parents will help with wedding cost. Her mom has even been excited helping Kay plan and what to do. \n\nMy  family has gone sour on me over the cost of the ring and called me stupid for being so extravagant when my sister is struggling but I don\u2019t think my sister problems should reflect on my upcoming marriage.", "created_utc": 1698865538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ljl8d/aita_for_getting_engaged/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The sister and family sound like such tiresome drama, I can almost guarantee the upcoming sequels to this one:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-\"AITA for not booking a room for my sister and her child on my honeymoon? My family says I'm insensitive for taking an extravagant trip and not doing anything to help my sister out\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-\"AITA for buying a home for my spouse and I, and not buying a home for my sister?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy god, what are these people on?   OP can spend as lavishly as he wants on whatever he wants, his sister has no claim on any of it.", "Your sister chose to have a child with an unreliable man.  She gets to deal with the consequences, you get to be a cheerful uncle when you can, not an obligated stand-in for the absent father.\n\nCongratulations on your engagement!\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYour sister made her own choices.  She is responsible for how her life is going, not you.  And your mom appears to be enabling her.\n\nI am sure you want to invite the both of them to your wedding, but keep the relationship at arms length until then.", "NTA\nYour sister's poor choices in life have nothing to do with you. You didn't pick her sperm donor. You didn't get rid of him. Those are two invitations that don't need to go out. Wouldn't want them \"triggered\"  over someone getting married \ud83d\ude44", "NTA.\n\nDo not ever share any kind of financial information with your family ever again.", "NTA! \n\n1) Congratulations - Wishing you a wonderful future with your wife. \n\n2) Your sister is the only one responsible for her child if she is raising the baby on her own - she should be going after the \"father\" for child support if she truly needs that much help. \n\n3) Never deny you or your fiancee something because of your family having an issue.", "Don't let your mom and sister ruin this moment. Your sister's baby is not your obligation. It's great when you can help family out but they do not have rights over your money. Focus on the future. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou're allowed to live your life and spend your money as you like.  If you had spent it all on fast food or lottery tickets over the last two years they would have had nothing to say.\n\nAlso I'm sure your sister was very jealous looking at the photos online.  Again not your fault, but going forward you might be a little more low-key with the wedding plans on FB.", "NTA\n\nYour sister, unfortunately, is dealing with the aftermath of having a child with an unreliable partner. Should that strictly be her issue? Hell no, it should be 1/2 his, but since he's disappeared she's the one left with all of it.\n\nNowhere in there is *any* of that your responsibility. You can help a little if you feel you can, but that's out of generosity, not a requirement. Neither she nor your mom get to spend your savings for you, and it's pretty obnoxious that they're giving you grief. I'd hang up or leave every time they bring it up, it's not something you need to discuss with them again.\n\nAnd, nothing is going to change now. You aren't going to return the ring, they're just bitching at you to bitch and to make you another \"bad guy\" in the story. But, it's not your baby! \n\nCongratulations on your engagement!", "NTA at all", "NTA. If you can help occasionally, great. But you are not obligated. Enjoy being engaged!", "NTA. congrats on your engagement! I just got married the weekend before last.", "NTA Not even a bit. Your sister probably shouldn't have had a baby if she's unable to take care of it. She is the only one who's responsible for her own choices. She is not entitled to your money and from the sounds of it she already gets plenty of help from your parents.\nCongratulations to your engagement.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAt this point, you and your sister are living independently and shouldn\u2019t have to rely on each other like she seems to want you to. Family doesn\u2019t always have to come first, and you shouldn\u2019t be stopped from doing fun things with your life because of someone else\u2019s misery.\n\nAlso, is your mom helping your sister out in any way? If she\u2019s this sour towards your spending decisions then certainly she should also be trying to help your sister out.", "NTA and the furthest thing from NTA\n\nHow is that your fault. They are SO entitled and disrespectful. What kind of bs \n\nMy blood is boiling for you. \n\nCongratulations!!! Please don\u2019t let your family piss on your engagement!!!", "OP, your sister's kid is not your problem. Tell your family if they are that worried they can foot the bill for your sister. You do what's best for you and your fiance'. Maybe go NC with your family until they realize you aren't your sister's ATM machine.", "NTA for getting engaged, you have a right to be happy in the relationship you've built. \n\nNTA for buying the ring you did. You've even helped your fam. It's not YOUR kid and YOU didn't pick to have a kid with someone who didn't stick around. Congrats in advance to marrying into a family that is excited about what is coming, sounds like you picked a good family to join.", "NTA your sisters child is not your responsibility.", "NTA, do you live with your family?  I know it's easy for me to say, but I would move TFO immediately.  Best of luck to you!", "NTA\n\nLol what? Your mom and sister are trippin. Congrats on your engagement!", "NTA, your parents and sister sure are. You are not responsible emotionally, financially, or physically for your sister's child. You should not be giving your sister any money. Your money should go to supporting yourself and planning for your future. Your family is not entitled to your money just because you sister made stupid decisions.", "NTA!!!\n\n\n\nDid you impregnate her?\n\n\nDid you tell her to keep the baby?\n\n\nDid you delude her into thinking being a parent is cheap or easy??\n\n\nIf the answer is no then why are you even worried. You have literally given your fiance something priceless! Not the ring.... But the fact that you recognised her interest/dream and took note and made it happen for her and that's amazing. You were the Ken to her Barbie and your sister is a selfish, living at home (I'm assuming single) child who needs to learn to work to get what she wants because no one else will. And your mother needs to learn that blatant favouritism eventuality leads to LC/ NC relationships. If that's what she wants then tell her to keep picking your sister over you (which is what she is doing) you are not responsible for your sisters decisions or situation in life and they both need to learn that. I hope you have an amazing wedding and congratulations!! \ud83c\udf3b\nPlease be advised, if the drama is this bad over a ring... It's only going to get worse when the wedding plans take place. I would be very wary of your mom and sis If I were you. You are definitely not the AH , but if you don't nip this behaviour now it will worsen. Good luck \ud83c\udf3b", "NTA. *I don\u2019t think my sister problems should reflect on my upcoming marriage.* Exactly. Why hasn't your sister gone after the BD for child support or applied for Gov services that help mothers & infants? The Gov would most certainly go after the BD if your sister were receiving any kind of Gov help. \n\nYou are an adult & presumably living on your own. Why should You be responsible for giving your sister money? Especially since you are starting a new life with your soon to be wife.
