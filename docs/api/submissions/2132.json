I\u2019d definitely not be having any form of contact for a very long time.", "NTA, \n\nTime to go zero contact.   Also, the relatives' words are worthless.", "NTA- while it is disrespectful and you definitely owe your hosts an apology, you are only human and that woman (MIL) should also keep her mouth shut. Telling people that they are bad parents repeatedly is beyond rude. Im glad you know to be very LC/NC and how to gray rock her. I'd bet MIL set you up just to get the family on side. Simply apologize to anyone who is upset (except her) and let them know that this has been an ongoing problem and you'd consider apologizing to her if she agreed to stop bashing your parenting skills. (Not that you owe her an apology, but the is a breadcrumb to put the ball in her court and take the weight off of you from bystanders.)", "NTA. Those certain relatives can get bent. Go NC. Continue being a kind parent. MIL thinks fear and respect are the same.", "NTA.  LC needs to go to NC and extended to more members of the family, it appears.\n\nI think you're a wonderful mother and you're doing just fine.  Children should respect parents, not fear them.", "NTA. Go no contact, she\u2019s a huge problem, and now she\u2019s using other people to fight her battles for her. There\u2019s no winning with her kind of personality, there\u2019s better strategies for dealing with her sort, and a lot of information online about how to deal with narcissistic personality disorder folks and theirs toxicity in ways that leave them without a lot of ammo for revenge. Best of luck, don\u2019t blame yourself, just learn some strategy for next time, I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s such a problem.", "NTA\n\nShe asked for it.\n\nThe \"sacrifices\" she made while raising your husband were the sacrifice of his self-confidence and his mental health.", "NTA MIL seriously needs to learn to shut her mouth. Is there any particular reason you have not gone no contact with her? You have every right to set boundaries and tell her to stop. Time and place may have not been the best but your children just learned that they do not have to let people be rude and disrespectful to them and that they are allow to stand up for themselves. Our children learn the most from watching us.", "NTA.. she needed to hear it. Also I\u2019d change low contact to no contact if I were you.. You don\u2019t need someone like that I your life. My grandmother had my mom at 18 and my mom had me at 23 there\u2019s nothing wrong with being young with a child. Now because of that I\u2019m 19 and my grandmother is still very active and can actually do things.", "NTA. Toxic MIL is toxic. Of course she made a scene and tried to get everyone on her side--you aren't really surprised by that, right? Making sacrifices comes with the job description, and it doesn't give abuse a pass. Anyone defending her just wants her to be appeased because it's easier for them. Too bad.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But you sort of deviated from your effective strategy\u2014 minimize contact.  You deviated for only a moment but predictably your comments (even as well deserved as they were) resulted in a scene.  At the engagement party of someone else.\n\nNothing in this exchange was ever going to change your parenting philosophy.  Nothing was going to change hers.  Your response didn\u2019t.

But here me out. It\u2019s not wrong that you stood up to her. It should have been done long ago.
