Its one thing to encourage independence at home (allowing the child to serve themselves) where you can clean up any spills but at parties unless the child is very clean and careful, you can expect spills and misshaps. Also by you making their plates it keeps them out of the way of adults who don't notice a smaller person infront of them and ensures they don't only eat rolls and desserts.

It takes practice and a willingness to consistently not engage with her nastiness. But it essentially will leave her flailing without the response from your she was seeking and means that you aren\u2019t participating in the escalation. \n\nUltimately you and your husband need to work on becoming indifferent to her.

Probably not. No matter how true it is, it's just not a good look for you to stoop down to her level and she has already manipulated her environment to enable her abuse, you don't really stand a chance of making any real impact.

Caring for a child you gave birth to is the bare. Minimum. It's really pathetic she wants worship for being mediocre.\n\nYou honestly just need to cut her off.

She saved all of her venom for the people closest to her.", "NTA, and you're not even close to being one.\n\nYou two already had enough to fully cut her off imo. She just used that party as a way to ambush you, and both of you handled it appropriately.\n\n>call me a weak mother and that my kids won't respect me unless they fear me.\n\n>that I'll be a doormat to them when it should be the other way around.\n\nShe already sounded controlling but these make it veer into frightening.", "NTA. Your MIL is a horrid human being and you should go NC.  Tell the rest of the family the stories about how she treated your husband and then see if they believe she deserves fair treatment. Then block them.", "NTA. All those people taking her side are doing so because they're afraid of her. They've probably spent decades making sure no one rocked her boat, and here you come, nearly capsizing it. Now they're left to ride out the storm *again,* and they resent you for it. Remember that when they come at you. Laugh in their faces and tell them she's their problem from now on. She's never going to be the warm fuzzy type, and she's never going to contribute anything positive to your life.", "NTA. You were merely making an observation.  The other FMs can suck rocks.", "NTA.

I grew up abused by my mother. I worked really hard to overcome her abuse. \n\nThen I became a mother myself. \n\nHoly sh$t will I now never ever ever truly understand wtf she was thinking by not getting herself help when I was young. \n\nAll parents make mistakes, lose their cool, say things they regret. It\u2019s the most frustrating role in life you will ever have. It\u2019s also the most AMAZING self improvement opportunity you will ever encounter. Good parents always seek to do better than they did yesterday. \n\nYour comments to her were accurate, imho. \n\nHero. NTA.", "This is just my opinion. I don't know how old she is, but I think it's more likely than not she grew up in the \"kids must be seen and not heard\" generation, where the parents ruled with an iron fist (that was often used to enforce said rule.) The combination of seeing the kids treated nicely with the fact it was you, who she hates, doing it likely is what brought it out.", "She is simply a hateful person. She is vindictive and nasty. Pain and suffering are her 'hugs and kisses'. This is one face of evil.", "Lol, that\u2019s basically what the OP said. That\u2019s why it hurt MIL so much. It\u2019s all true.", "She is not jealous, she is just mean.", "You are being too generous, she is simply evil.", "NTA\n\nIt was satisfactory hearing you gave it right back to her! Good job! And I wish I had a sweet, nice and nurturing mother when I was a kid. This is the correct way to be a loving mother. Glad your husband gave it to her too when she called after. Perfect ending", "NTA", "NTA.  Why would you want parenting advice from someone whose only qualification for being a parent was the physical ability to reproduce?", "NTA", "Well, dear, you were actually mothering your kids and that's something she would never have dreamed of doing. Considering where the statement came from, you should be very, very proud that she is against your parenting LOL\n\n\\`NTA ofc, but it's time to go NC with her and all the people who support her. Once she doesn't have you guys to use as scapegoats any more, she'll turn on the rest of the family members and they'll start understanding what you guys meant.", "How old was she when she had kids?

You're NTA regardless.", "OP=NTA\n\nWay to have your husband's back--PROPS!\n\nAlso, remind those annoying in-laws that your husband owes his mother NOTHING--SHE chose to bring him into the world.  And that her(and their) demand for \"maternal payment\" is JUST ONE REASON why she's a for sh\\*t mother, and that is NOTHING you want to replicate as a mother to your two beautiful WANTED children.\n\nKeep on the LC/NC with her and invite your in-laws to join that circle if they can't treat you and your family with respect.\n\nDo not apologize, do not engage further.  Tell her(if you wish) she made the scene, she ruined the party, you aren't any more interested in her tantrums than in her advice.\n\n(Edit to add)--has your husband had any therapy for this--it's hard to overcome that sort of abuse/programming on your own.", "NTA time to go NC with MIL", "It sounds like mil likes to brag to everyone how great she is but they aren\u2019t around enough to see the truth.  Oh well.  Narcissist will be narcissist and there is nothing that can be done about it.", "As a mother who is currently making a few sacrifices for my kids, its purely so that one day when they grow up they can get good jobs, have good homes, and maybe raise a family of grandchildren for me to spoil. Being a parent sometimes involves sacrifices. If MILS sacrifices need to be brought up time and time again, its purely for guilt tripping. She is using \"her sacrifices\" to try and prove \ud83d\ude44 that OPs husband is a bad son.\n\nKeep doing you OP, and I hope you and your husband have many lovely years of fun with your kids and any future grandkids.", "NTA!!! You are a good person and good on your for standing up for your husband and yourself.", "NTA - our husband could have been brothers! Yep I stole my husband too - got the letter to prove it. Head up, chin up and stick together.", "I'm gonna go with a very reluuctant ESH just because I think an engagement party was not an appropriate place for OP to blow up at MIL. I know she was being rude AF, but I think there's something to be said about not interrupting other people's important occasions with our own dramas and  distancing yourself from uncomfortable conversations instead of escalating them into a full blown conflict. \n\nThat being said, OP, you're a star for defending your husband the way you do.
