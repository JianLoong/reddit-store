But my father (m45) was on a whole other page as he almost instantly meet this woman \"Brooke\" and they got engaged. I grow resentful for the fact that he got over my mom's death so easily. I never liked Brooke to be honest. She never did efforts to make me like her nor did I. Even if we never had a friendly relationship she keep insisting on telling people that she is my mother, it triggered me badly and this has been for years. \n\nI talked with my dad about it and he said that I was overthinking, that Brooke just wanted to have a mother-daughter relationship with me.  I got irritated and demanded him to put her a stop, he said he would talk with her about it. Despite Brooke not being like the typical evil stepmother I never got to like or become fond of her and she has always been a stranger to me. My dislike towards her is more leaning towards the fact that she can't stop saying that she's my mother.\n\nI might be the AH because of this - Brooke's friends were visiting her. My dad told me to go greet them and so I did. I got inside the kitchen where Brooke and her friends were and greeted them. A friend of hers said: \"How big is your daughter now, Brooke!\" I felt so annoyed but I politely said: \"Thank you. But I'm not her daughter.\" Everyone got silent and I just said goodbye and went off the kitchen. Later that day my father began to scold me for being rude to Brooke and her friends. He said that I made Brooke cry and that I lacked of tact and that she **is** my mother now. I said that she wasn't my mom and she would never be, I also told my father to fuck off and stop bothering me.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: For a request, I decided to add some more INFO. Yes, I have tried to speak to Brooke about this and that it makes me uncomfortable that she calls herself my mother. She didn't care and continued doing it. Yes I have also spoken to my dad, he also didn't care. Both times I was polite and asked them to please stop it, but they ignored it completly.\n\nEDIT 2: Brooke has NEVER been a warm or caring person to me; to all of the people that comment that she cares. She isn't evil, but she isn't extremely friendly either and that's one of the reasons why I never got to bond w her.\n\nEDIT 2: Idk if this is important INFO.

A step should never insist on being called a parental title unless it is step mother/father.  I am a step child as well as a step parent.  Just like you can not get over your grief, you do not get to choose how others get over their grief.  There are some people that can\u2019t handle being alone (by alone, I meant not in a committed relationship, I do not mean that you do not count and he is alone) and if someone has been happily married before, they may be less shy about starting another relationship.   If this issue comes up again, you may want to respond (and you need to do this in a calm manner), \u201cdad, I did not make her cry, she insists on replacing my mother and pretending my mother didn\u2019t exist and that makes me terribly upset.  It\u2019s a shame that you do not support me in the fact that I do have a mother whether she is here with us or not.  If she would nit insist on calling herself my mother, she would not be crying.

And she could have tried a lot harder to be a good mother figure regardless.  It sounds like Brooke has no children of her own--it is nearly impossible to be a good parent when you come in to the middle of the job with no experience. Adults without kids tend to treat them like pets or miniature adults.\n\nAt this point it is too late for any real mother-daughter relationship to form.  However, she is still your father's wife, and eventually as an adult your life will be easier if you can come to some sort of truce.\n\nNot to excuse your father, but it is said that \"Women grieve, men replace.\" Men feel the hole in their life when their wife dies, but they try to avoid the feelings and just try to fill the hole.  Please don't take that to mean that your dad didn't love your mom.", "NTA. Whether you see her as your mother is your decision, not hers. She doesn't get to make that decision for you, she doesn't get to force it on you. You've established a boundary with her, she violated it, and you called it out. That's not you being an asshole, that's you standing firm on your boundaries which you have every right to do.\n\nSome people are saying NAH and I disagree. It'd be NAH if your stepmother just *wanted* that kind of relationship with you. It's fine to want things. Her going beyond that and trying to force it on you makes her the asshole here.", "NTA and I swear there should be a class that step parents have to go through.  If the step child is an actual little child, the step parent does take more of a parenting role in feeding, shared care and discipline, but being a step parent to a teen (having entered the picture when the child is already a teen) is a whole other ballgame.  You aren't the parent, you are there to provide a bit of guidance and to be there for the teen if they need you.  It's a much more delicate dance.  And OP, your step mother should have sat down with you to talk about what your relationship would look like - that you mutually agree on - how each of you would prefer to be referred to and so on.  Step parent/child relationships can be amazing, but they take work.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are right, she is NOT your mother.", "You\u2019re NTA. It sounds like you\u2019ve never been allowed the time or space to grieve losing your mother. Honestly, a loss I\u2019m sure one never completely heals from. She needs to recognize her role is a stepmother, and while she can act in a motherly way to you, she\u2019s not supposed to be trying to replace your mom. Your dad needs to make an effort to understand how you feel, too.", "NTA. They are adults and should know that you can't force a relationship. I'm sorry your dad is willing to destroy his relationship with you to placate his new wife. Was cussing at him the best way to go about it, no.

I even tell them \"you have a mom and dad, but I love you as my own, and you call me whatever feels comfortable.\" When I was a child, the dad thing was pushed on me and I hated it. So I get where you're coming from there.\n\nAnd to do that when your own mom died is horrifying! The fact that she thinks she can do that and that your dad is so indifferent is just mind blowing. I'm so sorry you're going through this.\n\nYou need to sit them down and have a discussion about boundaries. Brooke is not your mother, and she needs to stop addressing herself as such.", "NTA. Good job standing up for yourself. Keep it up.", "NTA.  At 17, you get to choose what this woman is to you.  If you don't want her to be your mother, then she's not your mother, period.

Brooke needs to wake up and smell the boundaries.   \nYou're obviously not interested in a mother- daughter relationship. Brooke's behavior is causing an unnecessary level of resentment, where there could be a cordial relationship. She's causing this. She gets to reap the consequences.   \nYou're NTA, but Brooke and your father definitely are. Your father didn't handle the situation.

If you came to that on your own and asked if you could call her that- that's one thing. This, nope. Not an asshole. You've set boundaries before and she has trampled all over it and your dad is allowing it. She gets what she gets as far as I'm concerned.", "NTA.

We could do with more detail on the conversations, but I think OP has discharged her moral responsibilities here and is in the right to escalate.  The dad has said he has talked to Brooke about this, so he's either lying, spineless, or not taking OP seriously enough to get the point across.  \n\nMy father always prioritized his partners and their children when I was growing up.

You sound very resentful of your father and his new partner, and it sounds like the grieve poisons your heart. Do you have anomyone outside of your family to talk to? Some clonselling, therapy etc.? Because brooke does nit sound line she deserves the resentment you harbor for her. She and your dad are misguided for trying to push you into acvepting her as your new mother. But not like they are awful to you. The world keeps turning, even when things are bad, and there is a new sunrose. That is true for your dad. He grieved your mom (grieve can be very individually, it does not mean that he did not care) and then continued his life and found someone new. \nSo, while NTA, neither your father nor your step-mother are really A.

But, maybe you can have a better relationship and get to know her a bit in a more friendly way. Sounds like you have some step sisters as well and she was probably just trying to bring you together as a \"family\", not to much to displace your mom.

If you don't want her to be your mother, that's ok, but you don't need to hurt her in the process.  Let her say the things she feels she needs to say as long as they aren't hurtful.

I got irritated and demanded him to put her a stop, he said he would talk with her about it.

My dislike towards her is more leaning towards the fact that she can't stop saying that she's my mother.\n\nI might be the AH because of this - Brooke's friends were visiting her. My dad told me to go greet them and so I did. I got inside the kitchen where Brooke and her friends were and greeted them. A friend of hers said: \"How big is your daughter now, Brooke!\" I felt so annoyed but I politely said: \"Thank you. But I'm not her daughter.\" Everyone got silent and I just said goodbye and went off the kitchen. Later that day my father began to scold me for being rude to Brooke and her friends. He said that I made Brooke cry and that I lacked of tact and that she **is** my mother now.

Are you the warm one then? Have you ever hugged her to thank her for dinner? Gave her a sincere compliment? Asked her to come with you to pick a dress, and not because you want her to pay? Invited her out for a walk? Asked her if she wants to go to the movies? I know the answer is no, because you don\u2019t want to have a new mom. And that\u2019s ok. But you also need to appreciate that Brooke can be a source of love and affection to your life. What would your mom want? I bet she would want for you to be loved. \n\nAnother point: If her friends are saying that \u201cyour daughter has gotten so big\u201d it\u2019s a sign that she speaks of you often and highly. Friends reflect the attitude their friend has. If Brooke was saying mean things about you, they would say also snarky things to you. If Brooke was not anything but very nice towards you when speaking about you, they wouldn\u2019t be either. If Brooke wasn\u2019t super nice and her friends also, they wouldn\u2019t have stayed in awkward silence, they would have replied promptly and with something that would have made you cry and you would be talking to it with your therapist for years.
