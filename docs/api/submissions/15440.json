We used to work for the parks in college and met there. For us, it has sentimental value as well as being something we both loved from childhood.\n\nNow, we are conscious to not be *those* Disney adults. We can hold conversations outside the movies and parks. We both work well paying jobs unrelated to the company. We have other hobbies and interests. Our son isn\u2019t big on Disney and we\u2019re cool with that. It is just something that we enjoy, as well as our daughters. We nurture all of children\u2019s hobbies and interests. We also don\u2019t blow all our money on this stuff. I know I may sound overly defensive, but we get a lot of comments from people who don\u2019t know us well.\n\nAnyway, we live in a renovated farmhouse on a bit of land that includes a barn that we finished off, with hopes to make it a guest house one day. In the meanwhile, we\u2019ve had a relative get married here and it was gorgeous.\n\nNow my sister (28F) wants to get married on our property and we were all for it. Everything\u2019s been planned for months and the wedding is in June. It\u2019s set to be outside completely but if it rains, we can move the party into the barn. The only reason a guest would have to go in our house is to use the bathroom. We have 2 on the first floor. The only Disney items are \n Winnie the Pooh hand towels. I told my sister I\u2019d replace them with regular ones. Wedding space has no Disney items. \n\nHowever, she wants me to take down everything Disney on the first floor of my home, as guests will see. We have a lot of Disney items, pictures, paintings, blankets, funko pops, decorations, figurines, dishware, etc, all made for adults and a lot of it subtle or vintage, but you can still tell it\u2019s Disney. \n\nOne, this would be a massive undertaking. It\u2019s not as simple as shoving stuff in a closet. We\u2019d have to pack it up and find a place to store. The sheer amount would require at least 2 hours of packing. Not to mention storage and unpacking after.Two, it\u2019s ridiculous to me. Who cares if people see?\n\nShe says it looks tacky and she doesn\u2019t want people to remember her wedding for that. I told her no. We\u2019re decorating the outside and barn as she wants. We\u2019re letting her use our property for free, which she keeps bragging about to friends as it\u2019s saving them a ton. \n\nWhen my husband and I stood firm, she whined to our parents who told us to grow up and take it down.", "created_utc": 1682193421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12vha75/aita_for_not_removing_the_disney_items_from_my/", "score": 12910, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We used to work for the parks in college and met there. For us, it has sentimental value as well as being something we both loved from childhood.\n\nNow, we are conscious to not be *those* Disney adults. We can hold conversations outside the movies and parks. We both work well paying jobs unrelated to the company. We have other hobbies and interests. Our son isn\u2019t big on Disney and we\u2019re cool with that. It is just something that we enjoy, as well as our daughters. We nurture all of children\u2019s hobbies and interests. We also don\u2019t blow all our money on this stuff. I know I may sound overly defensive, but we get a lot of comments from people who don\u2019t know us well.\n\nAnyway, we live in a renovated farmhouse on a bit of land that includes a barn that we finished off, with hopes to make it a guest house one day. In the meanwhile, we\u2019ve had a relative get married here and it was gorgeous.\n\nNow my sister (28F) wants to get married on our property and we were all for it. Everything\u2019s been planned for months and the wedding is in June. It\u2019s set to be outside completely but if it rains, we can move the party into the barn. The only reason a guest would have to go in our house is to use the bathroom. We have 2 on the first floor. The only Disney items are \n Winnie the Pooh hand towels. I told my sister I\u2019d replace them with regular ones. Wedding space has no Disney items. \n\nHowever, she wants me to take down everything Disney on the first floor of my home, as guests will see. We have a lot of Disney items, pictures, paintings, blankets, funko pops, decorations, figurines, dishware, etc, all made for adults and a lot of it subtle or vintage, but you can still tell it\u2019s Disney. \n\nOne, this would be a massive undertaking. It\u2019s not as simple as shoving stuff in a closet. We\u2019d have to pack it up and find a place to store. The sheer amount would require at least 2 hours of packing. Not to mention storage and unpacking after.Two, it\u2019s ridiculous to me. Who cares if people see?\n\nShe says it looks tacky and she doesn\u2019t want people to remember her wedding for that. I told her no. We\u2019re decorating the outside and barn as she wants. We\u2019re letting her use our property for free, which she keeps bragging about to friends as it\u2019s saving them a ton. \n\nWhen my husband and I stood firm, she whined to our parents who told us to grow up and take it down.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Tell her she *has* to rent a toilet, because your house will be locked up and *no one* will be going inside. There are options which are portable bathrooms and are much nicer than porta-potties. \n\nYou are already giving her a *massive* wedding gift and saving her thousands of dollars by allowing her to use your property. If she's not having to pay anything for a venue, and her catering is less expensive because she doesn't have to purchase it through a venue (which will be the case), then she can spend a little money on a portable bathroom.", "You sound like a lovely sibling.

It\u2019s clear that you want her to have a lovely day. \n\nYou are doing her a favour, which you are not obliged to do. In the end, this is your property, she is not paying you to use it and even if she was paying for another venue there would be conditions attached. \n\nYou are opening yourself up to a certain amount of risk/vulnerability as you are allowing access to your home (potentially to people you don\u2019t know) which may lead to damage and theft of your personal property not to mention potential invasion of privacy with people wondering into \u2018off limit\u2019 spaces in your home (which might be an issue for some). These may not be concerns for you however I wonder if any this is lost on her.\n\nBeing clear is being kind and as difficult as it may be, if you decide that the offer to use your space is conditional, you may need to kindly be upfront and clear around the conditions of utilizing your space if she wants to take advantage of your generosity.\n\nI wish you well with whatever you decide is the right path for you to take and hope that those around you can find it within themselves to respect your decision and boundaries.
