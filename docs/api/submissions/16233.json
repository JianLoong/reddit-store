My husband(34M) is deployed overseas, but we were lucky enough that he was able to attend the birth.\n\nSince I knew I would be a single mom basically, we planned very well before starting to even try to conceive. I saved 100% of my paycheck for over a year so I could stay home until my baby is at least 1 years old. While pregnant, I filled 2 freezers with casseroles or Crockpot packs, we have a whole room filled with baby necessities bought over 2 years... Basically whatever can make my workload lighter after giving birth.\n\nAlso, as the eldest of 5 kids who was parentified to hell and back, I did not have the same fear that most new moms do.\n\nNow to the situation: I met another mom during mommy yoga, we hit it off and became friends, she had her baby 2 weeks before me. We kept in contact via SM, but didn't get around to meeting untill last month.\n\nShe visited me, and from the get go was surprised at how clean my house was, and how rested I was. So I told her what I told you above. Not to brag, but because she asked.\n\nThen she invited me to her home, and when I got there she seemed on the verge of tears. Apparently her baby was sick and won't stop crying, she also has not been sleeping well. So I offered to watch her baby while she has a nap and maybe a shower. She was very thankful. I also asked if I could pick around the house a bit, and she was very grateful for that.\n\nI let her sleep for 5 hours; during that time I cleaned her living room, kitchen, and folded some laundry. I also took care of both babies. \n\nWhen she woke up, she was very sorry for sleeping so long, and for saddling me with child care and house work, I said that it was fine, it's nothing I'm not used to.\n\nA day later, she sent me a long text. The gist of it is that me being so put together made her feel like a horrible mom, and that me saying that what I did for her being nothing made her feel like a total failure. She said that she wanted some space from me, because I make her feel bad about herself.\n\nI replied with \"ok, take all the time you need\", but I did not say sorry.\n\nThen a mutual friend said that she is blasting me for not apologising after her first text.

You're having an easier time due to your past experiences and prior planning. What should you apologize for?

She feels bad about her own flaws and somehow turns it into your fault. Don't have friends who cannot handle your success.", "NTA - I can't understand what you would have done wrong. Everyone's situation with parenting is different. It sounds like you and your husband worked hard to become very prepared given your situation, and you should be proud of that! You're a wonderful person for doing what you did to help her. However she's feeling is on her, not on you. It's also a reflection of her character if she's \"blasting\" you over doing these nice things for her, and you have nothing to apologize for. It's not uncommon for new Moms to have help from others since it's so overwhelming in the beginning, and I don't think she should feel like a \"failure\" for that. I would have thanked you immensely and done the same for you when I was able. Good deeds for others shouldn't be responded to this way, so I'm sorry she's done this. You definitely don't need to \"pretend\" anything, either.", "NTA saying it was nothing is just a saying  we dnt need to not pick every word here.

Blasting someone because you have them is being shitty.", "Not gonna lie, this sounds like it's a debate bait post, written by a man who thinks that new moms are exaggerating how hard it is and all they have to do is save up some money, buy supplies and make some crockpot meals. Like. . .how well rested could you possibly be? A crockpot meal isn't going to make your baby magically sleep through the night.", "NTA, you were doing what you could to be kind and it's not your fault that it was taken the wrong way.", "NTA, as far as she's concerned you've done your best to help at the time. Just because she feels slighted by her own inadequacy doesn't make it your fault.\n\nBy the way, please share your secrets and preparation techniques with us prospective parents.\nI imagine a big part of it is knowledge and attitude, but you've mentioned a few good tricks with freezing meals and supplies, can you care to elaborate??", "NTA. Feel for the women, but damn be a little more ungrateful. Comparison is the thief of joy.", "NTA.\n\nShe is upset that you didn't Apologize for.... Being kind and considerate?! Screw this lady, you did nothing wrong. Hell, you cleaned her house and didn't make a big deal out of it FOR HER SAKE.\n\nRidiculous entitlement. NTA all day.", "Nta every mom struggles differently and you never know how bad. I have 3 kids but everyone always sees me as this perfect mom but i have weekly mental breakdowns.", "NTA.  Your friend is struggling with new motherhood and is not feeling up to the task (a very common experience for new moms), but you are not the cause of her struggles or feelings of inadequacy.  \n\nIf the friendship is an important one to you, you might want to apologize, but I don't know what you'd be apologizing for.", "NAH\n\nYou didn't gloat.  But a little tact would not be out of line.\n\nYou were able to save your entire paycheck, for a year?  That makes you incredibly lucky and privileged.

And I think it was really nice of you what you did. I'm not saying you should say sorry to your friend. But the thing is... Although technically you're the same position. You were actually responsible for little kids before. So, if I were you, I would text her to reassure her, she's not a bad mother, you're just more experienced in the field and you were happy to help her. \n\nAnd for all of the people who now will tell me that's not the OPs job to deal with someone else's insecurities... Postpartum depression is a real thing. And seeing someone who seems to be \"perfect\" and acts like is a not a big deal can be really hard. Maybe English is not my first language, but this saying that \"it takes a village\" is so so true, especially with the first child. \n\nBut also OP, I also enjoyed reading this post. I'll definitely remember some of your ideas (like freezing a lot of food) if I ever decide for another beby.", " NTA. She sounds insecure, but no need to blast you - very immature of her.", "NTA\n\nHonestly i even fail to see how the hell would you even be an AH in this situation, you prepared for it, she didn't, its not her fault ofc but there's no one to blame really, all you did was help her.\n\nI dont even think she's an AH either because i get that she's under an incredible amount of psychological stress, i just refrained voting for NAH because god damn there's always the \"mutual friend\" to escalate things they have nothing to do whith", "NTA your excellent planning is a testament to you and your husband. You shouldn't apologize for your good choices.", "NAH. You don't have to apologize for being in control of a situation while other people struggle.", "You don\u2019t need to apologize for not struggling but a bit more understanding that it\u2019s not just a choice others have made.

Doesn't make either of you an asshole. She could do well to keep your name out of her mouth, but who wouldn't be jealous. You're killing it girl, Kudos!", "NTA. You should give her even more space, meaning drop her completely. She is ungrateful af.", "NAH. Sounds like your friend was triggered by feeling inadequate and communicated that to you and you responded reasonably well.\n\nYou might, as an act of kindness, gently explain to her how much you needed to do in preparations to get to where you are.

No good deed goes unpunished.", "NTA  - she should be glad you helped her!", "NAH - it's disingenuous to fake a struggle. It sucks to be drowning and see others keep it together when they are in similar circumstances, but it's not on you to lower your own level of function to make someone else feel better.

Be happy about that.", "NTA. Honestly? You and your husband are very sensible and the rest of the world's roster of parents and future parents need to take notes from the both of you for parenting prep. Having kids is a lot of work and takes a lot of prepping. I commend you for doing your homework and making all the preparations you've made. Parenting is definitely a struggle and likely always will be, but she had absolutely no excuse to attack you like this, and even less of an excuse to blast you for not apologizing. You did 5 hours worth of housework and looked after her sick kid while she slept, and all she got out of the help you gave her was that you're a better parent than her and felt intimidated by it so she made you out to be the villain here? Unacceptable. \n\nYou have nothing to apologize to this woman for. If she's so insecure about her parenting skills, then she should ask for tips and tricks on how to make it easier for herself and be grateful for the help you gave her because you certainly didn't have to do what you did, but instead, she chose to avenge her bruised ego.

It sounds like she was feeling judged, and she may have been projecting her own self-assessment onto you, who is capable and practiced at minding kids/housework etc. You could also reply to your friend that you are sorry she took your words the way she did, and that the friend might benefit from a doctor's visit to get checked for PPD, because if that's what is happening, her perspective on life is going to be pretty affected.", "NAH, yet... but there are some things you need to think about.\n\nYou were organised, but you were also *lucky*.

New moms, really moms in general, typically feel lots of pressure to be super mom and do it all.

Although her feelings are 100% her responsibility, I don\u2019t think it would have hurt to have a little empathy. She is clearly struggling more than you. As you basically state in your post. \n\nIMO, \u201cI understand where you are coming from. I just want you to know I think you\u2019re doing a great job.

My husband(34M) is deployed overseas, but we were lucky enough that he was able to attend the birth.\n\nSince I knew I would be a single mom basically, we planned very well before starting to even try to conceive. I saved 100% of my paycheck for over a year so I could stay home until my baby is at least 1 years old. While pregnant, I filled 2 freezers with casseroles or Crockpot packs, we have a whole room filled with baby necessities bought over 2 years... Basically whatever can make my workload lighter after giving birth.\n\nAlso, as the eldest of 5 kids who was parentified to hell and back, I did not have the same fear that most new moms do.\n\nNow to the situation: I met another mom during mommy yoga, we hit it off and became friends, she had her baby 2 weeks before me. We kept in contact via SM, but didn't get around to meeting untill last month.\n\nShe visited me, and from the get go was surprised at how clean my house was, and how rested I was. So I told her what I told you above. Not to brag, but because she asked.\n\nThen she invited me to her home, and when I got there she seemed on the verge of tears. Apparently her baby was sick and won't stop crying, she also has not been sleeping well. So I offered to watch her baby while she has a nap and maybe a shower. She was very thankful. I also asked if I could pick around the house a bit, and she was very grateful for that.\n\nI let her sleep for 5 hours; during that time I cleaned her living room, kitchen, and folded some laundry. I also took care of both babies. \n\nWhen she woke up, she was very sorry for sleeping so long, and for saddling me with child care and house work, I said that it was fine, it's nothing I'm not used to.\n\nA day later, she sent me a long text. The gist of it is that me being so put together made her feel like a horrible mom, and that me saying that what I did for her being nothing made her feel like a total failure. She said that she wanted some space from me, because I make her feel bad about herself.\n\nI replied with \"ok, take all the time you need\", but I did not say sorry.\n\nThen a mutual friend said that she is blasting me for not apologising after her first text.

You didn't say what you did for her was nothing... you said it was nothing YOU WEREN'T USED TO. That's a HUGE difference in meaning. You should give classes on ways to reduce stress for new parents by being prepared for a baby. \ud83d\ude42", "NTA - She gets free help. She takes 5% of what was said personally. She ignores the other 95% of your effort. She badmouths you to mutual friends. OK, this makes total sense.\n\nExcise this relational cancer from your life...", "Lack of sleep makes people act crazy.  I'm going with NTA because what the other mom said was AH-ish, but I would give her a second chance if I otherwise enjoyed her company.

NTA. You rock.", "NAH \n\nShe\u2019s really going through it. And you said it was no big deal to do what she couldn\u2019t. I can see where that would feel a little ouch.

I was in her shoes with my eldest and could have used a friend.", "NTA. Her insecurities are not your fault. \n\nBut I will say, respectfully, as someone who was raised by a single mom, being a single parent and having a partner who works away are not the same thing. And they shouldn\u2019t be treated as the same thing.", "Nta, this should be her wake up call not a reason for her to get mad.", "Nta. It's hard being a parent, and she is in a different boat than you. It's okay she needs space, but it's also okay that you are different than she is. Be well.", "You are not the asshole lots of new moms feel inadequate when they see other new moms not having the same struggles as them and they do alot of that...my house isnt clean..or i havent cooked in days or changed clothes in days..like you said you did alot of planning and had your ducks in a row and sometimes when another mom is struggling she feels like she is a 'bad' mom", "NTA\n\nThis is insanely stupid on her end. Burning a bridge to someone able and willing to give you needed rest is childish and insane", "Not gonna lie, I\u2019d be jealous of you too, but I had my first at 17, so I wasn\u2019t much of a planner.", "NTA, I felt the same way your friend did. That PPD hit me hard and whenever someone helped me I felt like a terrible mom. Just give her some time.", "NTA her projecting her insecurities on you is neither your fault, nor your responsibility", "NTA. First of all, congratulations on being so very well prepared and forward thinking. \n\nShe is upset, obviously, and striking out at you. She is comparing how hard she has it and how seemingly easy you have it and it is making her more miserable than she already was. I would imagine it boiled up and she lashed out at something, anything, and you happened to be convenient.\n\nThe fact of the matter is most people find parenting difficult, especially at first. Your life experiences and decisions led you to be better prepared for the experience and now you are reaping the rewards. You shouldn't feel guilty or remorseful for that. \n\nHopefully, she will realize she isn' mad at you in the near future, but in now way are you at fault of anything here.", "NTA", "NTA. This is all entirely her own issue. Granted, I'd cut her some slack bcs of her emotions & situation, but it's still not your fault or issue on any way.", "NTA. To be honest I could see how she might feel like that, but thats not on you at all, it's how she's processing her own struggles and you are unfairly getting the brunt of it.\n\nWhen I (often) felt like a hot mess early postpartum, I always reminded myself that every experience and every baby is different. Sleep was not a strength of my daughters, lol, and made a difference in my functioning vs my friends.", "NTA.  She sounds insane.", "NTA I think she\u2019s taking out her own insecurities out on you.

She\u2019s probably going through some postpartum as well. \n\nI think it\u2019s really nice that you did all of those things for her and you have absolutely nothing to be sorry for. If you care about this friendship then I\u2019d say just explain to her that you understood the way she felt and explain why you felt so prepared, such as the food preparation and growing up parentified. It may just reassure her that she\u2019s not failing, she\u2019s just struggling right now but it will get better.

You seem like a great friend.", "NTA I too looked after plenty of kids and babies growing up, and to be honest none of the other new mums around me were interested in support or practical advise either.\nThey love a pity party and bemoaning how complicated it all is. With a level of experience similar to an old school style grandma it is not complicated looking after babies, it is tiring and stressful and sometimes boring but not complicated. \nPlanning as you have and as I did makes things easier and allows you to nap with baby and reserve energy for when baby gets ill and you need to pull out all the stops to keep going, kudos to you but definitely play it down when you speak to other new mums because you will not make friends. It\u2019s a hard lesson unfortunately.", "NAH. Honestly being a first time mom is hard and I catch myself comparing myself to others all the time. That being said, you prepared yourself to be a single mom. You cooked for yourself and saved it, you prepared baby necessities. But on the other hand, babies get sick and it becomes stressful. Cleaning becomes the last thing on your mind. Sleep is lost. While she shouldn\u2019t be blasting you for not apologizing, I see where you both come from.", "NTA you are very kind. As a mother of 2 who is also a SAHM I pray for a friend like you \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude02 especially when my youngest was a newborn I was so exhausted from the late nights with her and the early mornings with my oldest ( getting her to school) then cleaning and cooking immediately after.

We're in 2023. There's a thousand resources out there that are of value to new parents. Good on you for having the conscience to set yourself up for success. \n\nYou did a KIND thing. Unequivocally. The way she repaid your kindness by putting you on blast for...being smart? Is unacceptable. I would not want a friend who pisses on my efforts to be nice to them.  I would not want a friend who blames ME for their insecurity and failure to prepare appropriately.", "NTA. You have nothing to be sorry for. You did a great job setting yourself up for success while off work with the baby. She may be a bit jealous of your situation, that's her problem.

Don\u2019t feel guilty, because YOU did nothing wrong.\n\nYou\u2019ve had practice & from the sound of it, you & your husband planned a lot.

I would\u2019ve said n a h, if it weren\u2019t for the last line. It\u2019s really great that you managed to be so prepared and on top of everything, and that\u2019s really not something you should have to apologise for. Slagging you off to a mutual friend for not apologising is not okay at all.\nThat being said, she\u2019s probably under an immense amount of stress as well as hormones that are making her feel crap and probably contribute to lashing out like that. I think this is a good opportunity to take the high road, keep being kind, chances are she\u2019ll cool off and realise she was being a bit nutty about the whole thing.", "NTA! Wow! You do her a MASSIVE favor and this is her behavior?!? I would have cried tears of joy. You are an awesome friend. You don\u2019t owe her an apology AT ALL!", "NA in this whole story.", "NAH. So where I think you went wrong (but not asshole level wrong) was your reply to her text. I don't think an apology was necessary either but your reply was very cut and dry. Some reassurance, some grace, some kindness, some understanding. Any of those choices should've been part of your reply if you wished to keep this woman as a friend. Because, reassurance and emotional support is what friends do.\n\nEdit: grammar", "NTA. She definitely waited until after you helped her with all of that before she let you know how she felt though \u2026.", "NTA. I think a lot of first time moms wish they\u2019d prepared like that. The reality is, you only get one chance at being a well prepared first time parent. You excelled at it. Most don\u2019t. You\u2019re getting important time now. And I don\u2019t see any sign that you\u2019re taking it for granted. \n\nThe toddler years are where things get really fucked up. Then the next real hard phase is puberty. And the minute you add another kid into the mix, there is no amount of prep that will be enough. So, you worked hard to be able to enjoy this time. Do exactly that and don\u2019t feel bad about it.

People that are happy make their own success according to the studies- they don't get happy after they're successful.\n\nNTA - But maybe stop discounting how lucky you are that your baby is on the easier side. You most likely wouldn't feel the same with a colicky baby crying most of the day without giving you a break. A stockpile of diapers or baby wipes isn't going to fix that.", "Why would you say sorry. You helped her a LOT.  If anything, she should be studying your ways, not pushing you away.", "NTA", "Nta. You did everything right, and they are just winging.

It\u2019s not appropriate for her to blame you, but I think it would have good for you to respond in a sympathetic way even without apologizing. \n\nFor example, \u201cYou\u2019re not a horrible mom; it\u2019s common for new moms to struggle. I had experience raising my 4 younger siblings, so it may seem like I\u2019m put together, but I still find it difficult sometimes. Everyone parents at their own pace.\u201d \n\nI think saying something like that would have gone a long way to help reassure her and put her at ease.", "NTA, I get why she might feel that way, it comes more naturally to some, but she should also recognize that's not your fault. And especially shouldn't actually blame you for it, what is with people these days.", "NTA.  No good deed goes unpunished.", "NTA You were kind and helpful. \n\nShe's exhausted and overwhelmed. Sometimes when we're struggling, we can't handle seeing other people who are succeeding at what we're currently struggling.", "What you did for her was wonderful. I'm more like this other mom but I don't resent more competent/productive people, that would be silly.", "Definitely NTA. You did nothing wrong. She feels insecure. You prepared yourself for your situation and it has nothing to do with her. Why should you apologize? Because she feels as if you're more prepared than she was for motherhood. She's the one with the issue.", "Sounds like she has major post partum depression NTA", "You didn\u2019t owe her an apology. She is entitled to her feelings, but you didn\u2019t cause them.\n\nNTA", "NTA. But maybe have a different mutual check in on her? This sounds like sabotage of her needing help, but rejecting and attacking people for it, despite it only benefitting her. Maybe a touch of ppd brewing OR she could just be a miserable person all time and she was showing you who she was.", "NTA sounds like a  \"her problem\".  You were being a lovely, generous friend and got zapped by \"the no good deed goes unpunished\" fairy. I had a bestie for over 50 years who disowned me via text, because I have a great relationship with her 38 year old daughter. I was the labor coach for the birth of that daughter, had let her and her daughters stay with me rent free etc, etc. But now she has imagined somehow that she is a bad mom, because I was always there to help and support her.", "NTA. Mom guilt is normal but she is projecting. You aren\u2019t obligated to struggle or suffer just because other moms are. Maybe you could\u2019ve said \u201coh gosh I\u2019m sorry it made you feel that way, it wasn\u2019t my intention\u201d but even without the apology she is over reacting.

Ha, nope.", "nta and wow you are so organised you should do a blog or something or speak to expecting mothers i dont have kids or anything but wow you seem to have it all under control .... honestly people should own their struggles and their successes how else can we learn", "NTA she should have been picking your brain for every tip and truck you have. I\u2019m not crazy exhausted either with my 4 month old and she sleeps through the night and twice I\u2019ve shared with other moms who asked how I was doing with sleeping, that I was great. After which my husband said I should start lying because it could be making them feel bad. F that. They asked and I\u2019m fine. You did her a super solid favor. It\u2019s very odd she wouldn\u2019t want someone like you in her corner.", "Just voicing a concern cause it's something that came out in the post How are the expiration dates and use by dates for all the things you're stocked up for, Sometimes even non food items can deteriorate if they sit for a long time, Props to you for being prepared", "NTA- every mom and every baby is different.  You're a first time mom,  but you have a ton of childcare experience and had a plan that works for you.  Your friend is perfectly within her rights to take ab sheep away from your friendship if that's what is best for her mental health (although if it were me,  I'd want you around for support), but there's no reason you should pretend to struggle to make her feel better.  It's not like you told her, \"I don't understand why you're struggling being a mom is the easiest thing ever\"", "I mean\u2026 this just sounds like a misunderstanding amongst new mothers. It\u2019s great that you are currently functioning at a really high level postpartum, but not everyone does or can. Something about the way you wrote how you prepared does come across as bragging though. And let me tell you, not all kids are the same, not all ages are the same, and no parent is perfect. There will be a time when this child gives you a run for your money no matter how prepared you think you are. You don\u2019t HAVE to apologize but you could acknowledge her feelings if you value the friendship.", "NTA.\n\nI would try to talk to her if you want to still be friends.\n\nUltimately, you can't control if she feels insecure or incapable or like a failure though and the issue isn't you, it's internal. She has to manage those feelings and learn to be kinder to herself and find confidence in her own abilities.\n\nEvery child is different and plenty of mothers struggle with feeling inadequate or incapable, but they don't have to be 100% perfect or else. Sometimes they get overwhelmed and need helped, that is okay! Kids are a lot of work! Lots of amazing parents question themselves all the time, it doesn't mean they are bad, it means they want the best for their kids.", "NTA.  Woman is ungrateful and looking for drama.  Space sounds like a blessing lol.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm also really impressed by your prep. I was nowhere near that put-together!", "Nta, sounds like she is possibly going through postpartumand not thinking very clearly. I'm glad you have yourself together but alot of moms struggle whether it's postpartum, hormones, trauma etc. This doesn't excuse how she reacted but maybe explains. It's a horrible horrible feeling to deal with and can take awhile to work through.", "NAH. Acknowledging your past and your privilege might have helped smooth things over, but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

If someone had come over to let me sleep for 5 hours and helped clean my house I have been so grateful! Especially if that someone was a new mom. Instead she made this all about her and tried to make herself the victim?", "NTA. She\u2019s letting her insecurities control her life.", "NTA. It\u2019s totally common to struggle as a new parent, but it\u2019s not a requirement. My wife and I similarly were very well prepared before our daughter\u2019s birth, and it paid dividends. While we never experienced anything as egregious as you have, we definitely felt some subtle judgement from other moms who struggled quite a bit more.", "NTA\n\nYou were being a good human being. You even asked if she minded before you cleaned up around the house. Some people need help and wont admit to it. I get it, she feels like a failure... but I think she just needs a little help.\n\nShe will get over it, I hope, but you did absolutely nothing wrong. As a matter of fact you did everything right!", "NTA, omg what you did was so amazingly kind! I would kiss your hands. Yeah, I would probably feel as an incompetent mum too, but that's nothing to do with your kindness. She is absolutely ungrateful sh*t sorry to say. 5hour sleep to a sleep deprived mum is a gift of gold and you just did it without a wink. Maybe, she is questioning what's wrong with you, because most people wouldn't have done that for others (even if they had no other commitments themselves) Still she is acting unreasonably ungrateful.", "NTA - You did not gloat or promote yourself as  supermom.

Continue to thrive!", "NTA - You can\u2019t cure somebody\u2019s insecurity.", "op=NTA\n\nSo she got five hours of babysitting and Housecleaning and instead of thanking you is blasting you on social media.

Bah, she isn't worth an iota of your concern.", "NTA, as far as I can see. You seem to have just been trying to help. You shouldn't have to apologise for that.

And good for you for having it planned out.  \n\nMy daughter was a really good baby, we won the sleep lottery and she started giving us 5.5 hr stretches at 6 months.... by a year she was sleeping rock solid 11 hours with a small wakeup feeding at 2:30am.  The other moms in the mommy-and-me classes did NOT want to hear this.  I became close friends with the only other mother in the class who had a good sleeper.... we just hid in the corner and kept our lips buttoned up when the inevitable torture-deprivation stories rolled out. You gotta just ignore the haters.\n\nCongratulations on your baby!", "NTA\n\nEvery new mother has a different experience with similarities dotted through.\n\nThis woman has had different life experiences than you, may have a different support system and, quite frankly, is a completely different person with a completely different baby.\n\nDo not apologise, you have nothing to apologise for.", "NTA. I prepared similar to you with all the freezer meals and anything to make life easier with a baby. It made all the difference! And thank god I did, my baby had reflux and colic and it was sleep deprivation central. I never would have survived if I hadn\u2019t prepped. I think a lot of it is also time management and priorities. You manage your time and priorities differently than her and that\u2019s ok too.", "Sounds like the other mom is experiencing post partum depression. And she deflecting her feelings of inadequacy on you. NTA. You have nothing to apologize for. You did nothing wrong but truly helped.", "NTA.\n\nYou're a gem for doing that and helping - villages are hard to come by. You also do not sound at all judgemental of her which is so nice. \n\nEveryone deals with the transition to parenthood differently, the lack of sleep, the hormones. I had terrible PPD and a Velcro baby who would scream if not held and didn't want to sleep unless held either. \n\nSeeing someone at ease with it may have also really messed with me given what I was experiencing. You didn't make her feel any way. She needs to process her feelings and be more kind to herself. Hopefully she will realize that she can be friends with you. \n\nIt would not hurt to send her a text after giving some space to just let her know that everyone has different struggles and you hope she knows you don't think she's a horrible mom.

Don\u2019t apologise for a damn thing, OP", "Yeah, that's what brought it into NTA territory for me as well. Plus, OP did explain to friend already how she managed so well, so not like friend didn't know.\n\nSo, she is trying to project her stress onto OP and it isn't right and OP should just go NC with her.", "Yeah, friend isn't an asshole for having an emotional response to feeling like a bad mom.

She seems like a lot of work you don\u2019t need.", "Agree that she should probably be checked for PPD. This affects more people than we know and unfortunately society stigmatizes mental health so not enough people reach out for help.\n\nIt sounds like she has a colicky baby and you don't. Which is something you can't prepare for. Sleep deprivation is literally against the Geneva Convention, so it is literally torture.\n\nBeing parentified is wrong, but gives you a lot of experience so that you're not a first-time mom who is wondering if you're doing it right. So experience whether it comes from parentification or years of babysitting goes a long way. You naturally already have some muscle memory from the process and you don't question yourself the way a new mom does.\n\nImagine that this is all stacked up and your friend has PPD, plus sleep deprivation, plus being a newbie.  She is triple whammied.\n\nI would probably respond to her and tell her that you appreciate she needs some space. But she needs to give herself credit for the fact that her baby is colicky and not sleeping where yours is and that makes a huge difference in your two situations. Give her a gold star for how much she's dealing with and tell her that you're there for her if she does need some help.  It's always a good idea to tell somebody that no matter what they think, you think they're doing a great job!", "The mutual friend wasnt blasting her, the mutual friend was telling OP the lady was blasting her.", "Yeah prep is so helpful but you can't out-prepare colic or other issues. I feel lucky that my 3 month old gave us 4-5 hour chunks of sleep at a time right off the bat and now it's 6-8 hours pretty consistently (but not always of course). Unfortunately he also only wants to nap for 30 minutes at a time during the day which is super frustrating. I'm about to try and ninja off the bed now that he's finally back asleep, lmao!", "Also add PPD and hormones-- I don't have kids, but I do have regular old depression and I know my insecurities can come out in *force* when I feel like I'm inadequate to other people. Can't even imagine what that's like when you add hormones to the mix. Also, all the flack moms get about not being perfect/expectations to *be* perfect and then there's a moment where it gets reinforced that she is struggling but her friend whose also a mom seemingly has it together? Yikes.\n\nI think shit talking is a step too far and the long text could have probably been worded better, but if it's just \"normal\" baby stuff (excluding things we don't know like hormones, ppd, where's dad, if the baby is colicky, etc), it's a big change and people struggle. And our culture, great as it is, does not always smile on people when they struggle which can compound the issue until you get stuff like this.", "Yep. My daughter was an amazing sleeper basically from birth. My son came out and decided his bassinet was obviously a torture device and he refused to sleep in it. I didn't sleep more than an hour at a time for the first month of his life.

We never fully caught up from the first month and now my 10 year old has us going constantly!", "Yep, I was blessed with a mom who prepped me for the worst baby experience (my sister literally couldn't digest food properly and screamed for years, non stop).

I actually stayed home with both of them for 3 months each while my wife worked-- first one she finished up residency and second one she got leave too as an attending.\n\nMy first kid was *easy*. Like, stupidly easy. She slept through the night almost immediately. She took to the bottle, she hardly fussed. She was sleeping through the night by month 2 or 3. We actually had to set alarms to wake ourselves up to wake her up to eat. She would sleep through the night otherwise and we needed to get her to eat more. I slept more during my 3 months of leave than I have in years since. I'd regularly get in delightful afternoon naps after cleaning and cooking, feeding the baby, walking her around South Coast Plaza in Orange County. It was 3 of the most amazing months of my life.\n\nThat kid was a dream.\n\nNobody believed me that I was staying home with a 1-3 month old because I was sunshine the whole time. We regularly had people tell us that we were weirdly well-rested, weirdly chipper. And yes, we were. Because our first kid was *easy*. Then we had our second, and she was an absolute 180. Totally different story. Didn't sleep through the night until she was 2 years old. Most of my grey hair now is from that kid.\n\nI joke all the time: we had the second kid because of the first kid. I had a vasectomy because of the second kid.\n\nThe takeaway: this mom got lucky and all the prep and knowledge in the world doesn't matter if your kid is a fireball like my second. Every kid is different.", "My baby does is currently sleeping a bit better through the night, but when he wasn't, not being stressed about cooking helped a lot. I could throw something in the crockpot, and nap with him.

And I know first time moms can be more overwhelmed than experienced ones, I am kind of lucky that my baby does not feel like my first kid, that honor goes to my younger brother, whom I had to feed, change and watch at the ripe old age of 9. That is how I knew to prepare, and why I am not overwhelmed.\n\nAlso, I had an easy delivery. I was dreading the possibility of having a traumatic experience, but it was good (comparatively), and I was recovered enough to take care of my son by the time my husband was deployed, less than a month later.", "Yes, absolutely reads that way to me, too. \n\nAlso. I thought I was well-prepared for parenthood: had all the supplies I needed, had a generous maternity leave (thanks, Canada), had a supportive partner, read all kinds of books about pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding, and, like OP, was basically my mom\u2019s coparent from the time my youngest sister was a baby. I\u2019m talking \u201cexpected to be the one to stay home when my younger siblings were sick\u201d type co-parent.

I think the words she was looking for were \u201cthank you\u201d.", "Also some babies are just easier than others. Some moms recover from birth easier and faster than others.

It\u2019s not advice she can take, it just makes you better than her and that makes her angry.", "The thing is, I bet OP would have helped her plan/organize things if she'd kept her whining to herself.\n\nI think OP would have helped her prep/organize food.

Waking up was a few hrs after that. Once, when he was a toddler, I put him in time out around 3pm. He fell asleep, my dumbass let him sleep for about 30 minutes. He didn't sleep a wink that night... or nap the next day... and still wouldn't go to bed until after midnight. He drove me crazy!!

You have nothing to apologize for. I do suspect that that's not the most pertinent info, though. She feels inadequate as a first time mom when comparing herself to you as a first time mom, but in some ways, you aren't. You were parentified as a kid, and presumably had to do a lot of the work of caring for your young siblings while still needing to do all the stuff you needed to do for yourself.

The bottom line is that you manage your baby and your household well and you're not as stressed as the other mom. There is NOTHING about your behavior that you need to be apologetic for as you didn't ever brag about your situation. She asked how you were managing so well and you told her. The end.\n\nShe has no right to demand an apology from you about YOUR BEHAVIOR, especially after all the help you gave her. I can see something like \"I'm sorry you have a difficult baby\" being an appropriate comment to her as she sounds like she has a fussy baby. Or \"I'm sorry your situation is difficult\" as she does seem to be having difficulties. But as far as you having to apologize for YOUR behavior?? No way.\n\nPlease don't apologize for your behavior. If the other mom and your mutual friend can't understand this, then I think it's worth letting them go.", "With respect, you were still eating out twice a month, on *one* of your household incomes, when you had cut back on your lifestyle to save. For many people that's out of reach when they *aren't* cutting back (and many more have nothing available *to* cut - their outgoings exceed their income and they are sliding further into debt every month). So I'm not sure you *are* very aware how lucky you are.", "See I read that as her friend was triggered in the psychological sense, like it brought her back to a place of trauma, so I was giving her space on that.", "Then that makes you all the more NTA.

The problem is clearly not with OP.", "Strongly disagree. I don't think either of them are bad people. New mothers struggle and it IS tough seeing other mums find it easy. A friend of mine had a very sick and colicky child who had to be fed every two hours and held upright for an hour after. Realistically, she got 30 minutes sleep at a time. Once that was over she was horribly embarrassed for using a night nurse twice.\n\nThe people who had met her when our babies were little all had different experiences and at times we all got frustrated with how hard it was. We all had the good grace to empathise even if we found it easy. \n\nA struggling mother should be supported not criticised.", "Probably out of embarrassment.

It's a stupid thing to post.", "I\u2019m not clear on if the apology demand was done at the other mom\u2019s behest or if that mutual friend was just trying to smooth things over.", "She did and I applaud that. Supporting someone also involves understanding what an individual wants and needs.

Baby sitting, cleaning, or being a good friend who saw someone in need of help and offered? \n\nCut her off, offer no apology and put your foot down over the \"blasting\". Brushing off thanks is a normal reaction to being thanked. People who brush off thanks are often people who don't see what was so special or extra about what they did, to them it's just common curtsey like picking up keys someone dropped or holding a door opened for someone.

A friend of mine didn't prepare and even went on a road trip with her 6 weeks old. Her baby doesn't vomit after every feed, doesn't need to be held for hours and just sleeps. Do I wish my baby would have been like that at the beginning? I guess so. But all of it made me even more grateful for how good my little one is doing now. \n\nFor me, it sounds like this woman is jealous of your situation and let it out on you. You have nothing to apologise for. You helped her out and instead of thanking you, she is kicking you in the back by complaining on social media.

She sounds like she\u2019s being very judgmental about herself. I can understand that, as many mothers feel that way. However, while a person in that state will compare herself unfavorably to you, I cannot understand why she would get angry or demand an apology.
