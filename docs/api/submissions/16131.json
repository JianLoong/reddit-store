She\u2019s a little judgmental, not of me particularly, but in general. She babysits for other children and constantly judges the parents. She says she\u2019d never let her kids act the way the kids do. Sometimes it makes sense and I agree. Others, she claims that her future kids will never, ever throw a tantrum. They\u2019ll accept no the first time, the only time. I\u2019ve told her good luck with that when it comes to toddlers. My son is learning no and has appropriate consequences for tantrums, but he\u2019s learning. It\u2019ll happen. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that Gia is infertile. She can\u2019t have kids without medical intervention or adoption.\n\nSaturday night, we went out for my dad\u2019s birthday dinner. I messed up and didn\u2019t prepare my toddler well enough. He got overstimulated and began melting down. I quickly took him out of the restaurant to calm him down before he could cause a scene. It took all of 5 minutes and we returned, he got food and was all good. Giana started on \u201cmy future kids will NEVER act like that in a restaurant\u201d. I ignored her.\n\nThe next day, myself, Tommy, our parents, my son and Giana went to the mall for an event they were having. My son was playing in a structure and I had my eyes on him. My mom asked me a question and I turned to answer her. When I turned back, he was gone. Panic set in and myself, my parents and Tommy, along with some people  nearby began helping me look. It only took a few minutes to find him and he was perfectly fine, he had seen a pretzel cart and wandered off.\n\nI was still pretty worked up, holding onto him for dear life. He had never wandered off before. My mom was reassuring me, saying it happened to her with both of us kids. \n\nThen I hear Giana \u201cwhy weren\u2019t you watching him?\u201d I tried ignoring her. Then she said \u201cI would\u2019ve never let him wander off\u201d.\n\nI was already so worked up and upset, I snapped. I said \u201cit\u2019s easy being a perfect parent when you don\u2019t have kids. Come back to me when you do.\u201d Giana got visibly upset. She then made Tommy take her home.\n\nTommy and Giana have both texted me telling me how insensitive that is since she can\u2019t have kids. To me, she talks about having kids all the time, so why is it different for me to say that?

Toddlers are toddlers, they throw fits and sometimes, it's for no reason. You removed your toddler from a situation and Giana had no business making any further comments on the matter. Nobody does.

Your reaction to unsolicited advice is to make a deeply personal attack in retaliation. You set out to hurt her feelings, and it worked.", "YTA because you could have mentioned that Giana\u2019s behavior was bothering you and try to get her to stop making these comments around you.

I've been a nanny, a teacher, and a stay-at-home mom to 3 kids, so I have a lot of experience and education in child and adolescent development tantrums and pushing limits are part of the development and learning process for kids. Giana is delusional if she thinks her kids will never have a tantrum.

Because they aren't annoyed with me for taking their iPad off them yesterday, for juggling a million things while making their lunch and therefore not giving them my undivided attention etc. I hope this makes sense, but I think you're right.", "NTA - She talks about having kids all the time and has no issue giving her unneeded and useless opinions.

If I saw a helicopter in a tree, I\u2019m no pilot, but I\u2019d say someone definitely messed up.", ">And OP mentioned nothing about this woman being infertile\n\nShe not only mentioned it, she knew it's important to the context of the story, right here:\n\n>It\u2019s also important to note that Gia is infertile. She can\u2019t have kids without medical intervention or adoption.\n\nAs for\n\n>It\u2019s actually extremely rare (or just not possible even)\n\nWhich is it, \"extremely rare\" or \"just not possible even\" for children to not have *regular public* meltdowns? \n\n>Separate things.\n\nWhat things?", "OP didn't even say anything harsh. She said \"its easy to be a perfect parent when you don't have kids, come back to me when you do.\" Literally a fact, did not mention the infertility at all, and made a straight forward point. Maybe her tone was firm but her words were true. Communication at its finest. I see no way that OP was an AH.", "What I\u2019m saying is that normal kids don\u2019t react to life that way. If you threw one tantrum ever and never again, the lesson you learned in doing it was that you wouldn\u2019t be supported through big feelings, and that expressing yourself wouldn\u2019t have positive outcomes in your life. That\u2019s not something to brag about. Also, you don\u2019t see your nieces and nephews under every circumstance and in every situation, and if they are not also being emotionally abused, they probably melt down and freak out sometimes. \n\nYou\u2019re not making the points and arguments you think you\u2019re making. You know that moment when your friends are sharing funny stories from childhood, and you share yours and everyone gets quiet and sad? That\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now.", "You were so young you don't remember but you got grounded? What did you get grounded from, as a toddler? 4 kids and no tantrums? Just impeccable behavior at all times... Inherent understanding of the word no. A miracle. \nAlso, I know that I had to have thrown tantrums, but my parents didn't give me a rundown on every fit I threw in life. But enjoy believing this fairy tale.", "I like to say they have all the same emotions as an adult, but just a much smaller vessel to carry those emotions in. Yeah, a 20oz bottle can hold 16oz of water just fine, but that'll overflow in an 8oz cup. It doesn't mean the cup is inferior or bad, it just means the cup can't handle that much water. It's the same with toddlers and emotions. \n\nPlus, what is a small deal to us adults because we've lived through it before can easily be the worst thing to ever happen to a toddler, because they've only been alive 2 years and haven't had that many bad experiences (hopefully). We know their balloon popping isn't the end of the world, but they haven't lived long enough to know that yet. Of course tantrums aren't fun to deal with, but we have to have understanding with the little ones. Once upon a time, we were that screaming kid.", "I know I never threw a tam trum, whatever that is.  But no, OP is NTA.", "Ruined Christmas! Lol hilarious.", "Op asked if she was the asshole for what she said, not if she was the asshole for having her child wander off. \nAlso I like to think that people can educate and teach without having to shame the person. It\u2019s not about hurt feelings, I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s a point to be mean for the sake of being mean. You can give constructive criticism and advice without the negative \u201cYou stuck my child would never do that/that would never be me\u201d statements.", "\u201ccome back to me when you do\u201d sounds very very bad knowing she is infertile. I don\u2019t have strong feelings about this story but that line isn\u2019t okay", "Im not bragging. I mentioned my boyfriends sister because she doesnt abuse or hit her kids. They are all very very well behaved  and i used her as an example because you can discipline kids into not throwing a tantrum or argue back without violence but it seems to a \"fairy tale\" that doesnt exsist so I must be delusional and insane.", "Okay lol.", "This is such a lovely, compassionate way of thinking about kids", "Oh I love this analogy!", "Sorry, that wasn't funny dude.", "Being infertile doesn't mean you can never be a parent. The point being, until you are a parent you have no idea what you're talking about. Don't criticize people on a topic you have zero experience in. Hopefully Giana learned the valuable lesson of keeping her uneducated self riteous opinions to herself. She can tell the mirror how much of a better mom she would be than OP.", "Gina has repeatedly referenced her future children in her criticisms of OP, so in her comment OP was respecting that Gina plans to have a family one day, despite her infertility.", "The thing is, children aren\u2019t little adults. You can\u2019t really reason with them, because they lack both the neurological development and life experience to understand rationality. Their reactions often seem irrational or disproportionate (to adults) to the stimuli they\u2019re experiencing, and they have really big feelings that they don\u2019t know how to cope with or express. That\u2019s just normal kid stuff. \n\nGood parents help them through those reactions and emotions, and teach them ways to express themselves or deescalate their feelings. They validate the feeling and correct the behavior. Maybe your boyfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s kids don\u2019t freak all the way out because she and her partner frame her kids\u2019 emotional reactions as them learning to experience the world instead of an attack against their parenting (the way a narcissistic or otherwise abusive parent would interpret a big feelings reaction), but I promise you, at some point in those kids\u2019 lives, they have lost their tiny shit over something that did not seem to warrant that reaction from an adult perspective. It\u2019s just the way we are wired to mature. Humans don\u2019t emerge as fully formed creatures in any way, certainly including in terms of emotional maturity.", "Katey and her husband set a good example themselves for their kids. Im not saying they dont ever misbehave but they dont throw tantrums and argue back. The 4 year old does get difficult sometimes but she understands the word no. Like I said she has major allergies and isnt allowed alot of things but she understands when her mother tells her she ismt allowed to eat something. If she does get something on her skin or accidentally gets it in her mouth she or the other kids will immediately tell Katey.", "Right, and that\u2019s great. It sounds like they\u2019ve approached parenting with empathy and constructive help to enable their children to become emotionally healthy. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is that there were probably moments you\u2019ve not seen or heard of from when the kids were much younger (most hard tantrum throwing is a bit younger, even younger than four), that involved near hostage-negotiation-like techniques from the parents. Because that\u2019s parenting. You don\u2019t see everything when they\u2019re not your kids; you have a skewed and unrealistic idea of what children are like because your own upbringing was abusive and traumatic (I get it; mine was too), and I\u2019m gently telling you that you have big blind spots here. You don\u2019t have the full picture, and you\u2019re working from faulty and incomplete knowledge. Kids throw tantrums, and they need to learn \u201cno.\u201d It doesn\u2019t just happen magically.", "You have absolutely no idea when and how many tantrums their child has had before they learned to regulate their behavior.\n\nI guarantee you their children had tantrums as toddlers."]}
