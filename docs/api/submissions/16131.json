She\u2019s a little judgmental, not of me particularly, but in general. She babysits for other children and constantly judges the parents. She says she\u2019d never let her kids act the way the kids do. Sometimes it makes sense and I agree. Others, she claims that her future kids will never, ever throw a tantrum. They\u2019ll accept no the first time, the only time. I\u2019ve told her good luck with that when it comes to toddlers. My son is learning no and has appropriate consequences for tantrums, but he\u2019s learning. It\u2019ll happen. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that Gia is infertile. She can\u2019t have kids without medical intervention or adoption.\n\nSaturday night, we went out for my dad\u2019s birthday dinner. I messed up and didn\u2019t prepare my toddler well enough. He got overstimulated and began melting down. I quickly took him out of the restaurant to calm him down before he could cause a scene. It took all of 5 minutes and we returned, he got food and was all good. Giana started on \u201cmy future kids will NEVER act like that in a restaurant\u201d. I ignored her.\n\nThe next day, myself, Tommy, our parents, my son and Giana went to the mall for an event they were having. My son was playing in a structure and I had my eyes on him. My mom asked me a question and I turned to answer her. When I turned back, he was gone. Panic set in and myself, my parents and Tommy, along with some people  nearby began helping me look. It only took a few minutes to find him and he was perfectly fine, he had seen a pretzel cart and wandered off.\n\nI was still pretty worked up, holding onto him for dear life. He had never wandered off before. My mom was reassuring me, saying it happened to her with both of us kids. \n\nThen I hear Giana \u201cwhy weren\u2019t you watching him?\u201d I tried ignoring her. Then she said \u201cI would\u2019ve never let him wander off\u201d.\n\nI was already so worked up and upset, I snapped. I said \u201cit\u2019s easy being a perfect parent when you don\u2019t have kids. Come back to me when you do.\u201d Giana got visibly upset. She then made Tommy take her home.\n\nTommy and Giana have both texted me telling me how insensitive that is since she can\u2019t have kids. To me, she talks about having kids all the time, so why is it different for me to say that?

Toddlers are toddlers, they throw fits and sometimes, it's for no reason. You removed your toddler from a situation and Giana had no business making any further comments on the matter. Nobody does.

Your reaction to unsolicited advice is to make a deeply personal attack in retaliation. You set out to hurt her feelings, and it worked.", "YTA because you could have mentioned that Giana\u2019s behavior was bothering you and try to get her to stop making these comments around you.

I've been a nanny, a teacher, and a stay-at-home mom to 3 kids, so I have a lot of experience and education in child and adolescent development tantrums and pushing limits are part of the development and learning process for kids. Giana is delusional if she thinks her kids will never have a tantrum.

Because they aren't annoyed with me for taking their iPad off them yesterday, for juggling a million things while making their lunch and therefore not giving them my undivided attention etc. I hope this makes sense, but I think you're right.", "NTA - She talks about having kids all the time and has no issue giving her unneeded and useless opinions.
