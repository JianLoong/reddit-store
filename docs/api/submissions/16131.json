She\u2019s a little judgmental, not of me particularly, but in general. She babysits for other children and constantly judges the parents. She says she\u2019d never let her kids act the way the kids do. Sometimes it makes sense and I agree. Others, she claims that her future kids will never, ever throw a tantrum. They\u2019ll accept no the first time, the only time. I\u2019ve told her good luck with that when it comes to toddlers. My son is learning no and has appropriate consequences for tantrums, but he\u2019s learning. It\u2019ll happen. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that Gia is infertile. She can\u2019t have kids without medical intervention or adoption.\n\nSaturday night, we went out for my dad\u2019s birthday dinner. I messed up and didn\u2019t prepare my toddler well enough. He got overstimulated and began melting down. I quickly took him out of the restaurant to calm him down before he could cause a scene. It took all of 5 minutes and we returned, he got food and was all good. Giana started on \u201cmy future kids will NEVER act like that in a restaurant\u201d. I ignored her.\n\nThe next day, myself, Tommy, our parents, my son and Giana went to the mall for an event they were having. My son was playing in a structure and I had my eyes on him. My mom asked me a question and I turned to answer her. When I turned back, he was gone. Panic set in and myself, my parents and Tommy, along with some people  nearby began helping me look. It only took a few minutes to find him and he was perfectly fine, he had seen a pretzel cart and wandered off.\n\nI was still pretty worked up, holding onto him for dear life. He had never wandered off before. My mom was reassuring me, saying it happened to her with both of us kids. \n\nThen I hear Giana \u201cwhy weren\u2019t you watching him?\u201d I tried ignoring her. Then she said \u201cI would\u2019ve never let him wander off\u201d.\n\nI was already so worked up and upset, I snapped. I said \u201cit\u2019s easy being a perfect parent when you don\u2019t have kids. Come back to me when you do.\u201d Giana got visibly upset. She then made Tommy take her home.\n\nTommy and Giana have both texted me telling me how insensitive that is since she can\u2019t have kids. To me, she talks about having kids all the time, so why is it different for me to say that?

Sure it's easy to judge when it's not your child. She just sounds young and na\u00efve, but that doesn't giver her cart blanch to act like a jerk. If you're goin to hurl insults at people, you best learn how to take them. She may not be able to have biological children, but she sure seems to think she'll still have kids, so I agree with your sentiment. It's not any different, she's just using that as an excuse to make you feel bad. Don't.", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s crazzzzzzzy pants to think her kids will be perfect.  \n\nSo..admit that what you said wasn\u2019t the best thing and then address the bigger issue of her parenting comments. Because, really.", "NTA\n\nWhen someone is constantly rude, it\u2019s only a natural consequence that they will receive rude comments back. If she wants to be treated with more consideration, SHE has to start treating people with more respect.", "NTA it\u2019s seems so easy for her to judge other kids when she doesn\u2019t have any. Not your fault she\u2019s infertile, she should\u2019ve considered that fact when she was constantly offering unsolicited advice. Your question was perfectly valid, \u201cwhat exactly are your credentials that make you so qualified to judge everyone else\u2019s kids?\u201d", "NTA. Giana was the one being insensitive by insulting the parents around her with expertise she didn\u2019t have. She has been lucky no one has snapped at her before this over what she has been saying, and being infertile is no excuse for being rude.", "NTA the only perfect parents are people without kids", "NTA. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that you shouldn't offer criticism to someone while they're upset, especially if it isn't constructive criticism. Besides that, you didn't throw her infertility in her face when it sounds like she very much wants and is planning on having/adopting kids at some point. Her insecurities are not your fault.", "NTA. Giana sounds obnoxious. I don't have kids myself, but I would never say those things to another parent. To me, you sound like a great parent anyway. Toddlers are toddlers, they throw fits and sometimes, it's for no reason. You removed your toddler from a situation and Giana had no business making any further comments on the matter. Nobody does. You never know what someone else might be going through with being a parent, and it's inappropriate to say those things to anyone that has children.", "NTA. It is easier to be a perfect parent without kids.", "NTA. Constant nitpicking and jabs at your parenting will make anyone snap, how do they not see how shitty her behaviour was??", "NTA.  If childbearing is such a sensitivity, Gina shouldn't feel as free to opine on her hypothetical parenting skills.\n\nShe's just embarrassed because you called her out and is trying to throw it back on you.", "NTA.  I was prepared to say you should have chosen your words more carefully but given that she talks about future children all you need to do is remind her that you see her future children AS her children and your family members so this was not commentary on how they will build all of your family.  \nEvery person is a genius about parenting before they do it and she\u2019ll see.  That\u2019s plenty enough revenge for her comment.", "NTA. I have three kids.\nUnsolicited advice is never asked for.

Instead she made an unkind comment. When you snapped back? She kinda had it coming.\nIf it hurt her feelings because she can\u2019t have kids? Well\u2026 she shouldn\u2019t have hurt yours.", "NTA. She was being a judgmental jerk at really bad time. Maybe she'll think before she speaks next time now that someone has spoken to her they way she spoke to them.", "Absolutely NTA. She clearly plans on becoming a parent somehow\u2014good for her, I know plenty of successful IVF and adoption stories\u2014but that doesn\u2019t give her license to shit all over parents who are doing their best right now. It\u2019s incredibly cynical of her to then cite her fertility struggles as a shield when you call out her extraordinarily obnoxious behavior.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to wind her neck in.", "NTA but Giana sure does think she's an expert on something she has no experience with! And no I don't count babysitting as the same experience as having your own children 24/7. You didn't insult her ability to have kids and if she really wants children I assume she hasn't ruled out adoption. I would have snapped too and she sounds like no fun to be around.", "No no no NTA. NTA all the way to the damn bank. She seems to have no problem insulting you. She made a series of dick comments. And not one person defended you and demanded she apologise. Wtf?! \nDon't apologise. Ever. \nMotherhood is hard enough and lonely enough without comments like this from people who haven't got a fucking clue.", "NTA. Your comment came only after a very long string of criticisms from Giana. Can she physically have children of her own? No, but she clearly plans on going another route, and she\u2019s clearly not too sensitive about the subject because she praises her \u201cfuture children\u201d nonstop. I think anyone in your position would have snapped eventually with all her ignorant statements. Heck I don\u2019t even have kids myself, and I\u2019m annoyed at how easy she seems to think parenting is.", "Nta, she kept making those digs at you. It is very easy to say that you will be perfect until you are in this situation.", "NTA. Insensitve? Yes. But if she's going to keep pounding away at you like that, people have to expect that at some point, you're going to pound back. It's insensitive, but if you're going to take shots, expect to get shots back, Giana.", "NTA - Having fertility issues does not give her a free pass to take shots at other people. \n\nAlso - you did not take a shot at her for having fertility issues or suggest that her opinion doesn't matter because she will struggle have biological children. You said that since she isn't currently a parent, she cannot understand the challenges of being a parent and that she should reserve judgement until she has actually experienced being a parent. She is able to be a parent. That journey, when she starts it, may just be more difficult for her.", "NTA\n\nRemind them that Giana makes insensitive comments all the time. Especially when you think you've just lost your kid.\n\nThere were a lot of ways you could've been TA, but her timing on those comments, she got what she deserved.", "NTA. She insulted you two days in a row, she doesn't get to cry when you finally hit back. Moreover, it didn't come off to be as a shot at her fertility. She constantly says she will have kids when deriding others, implying she will adopt or otherwise address her infertility, and so your comment is just to wait until she does. Even if it is a sensitive issue, people shouldn't pick fights if they're that sensitive.", "I've been there! I cannot begin to describe the sheer panic of losing a young kid. It could happen to anyone. It takes a few seconds or a little misscomunication about who's watching the kids. Ginna was horrendously insensitive, judgemental and out of touch.\n\nObviously what you said was mean. In any other situation I'd say ESH but given what just happened and the amount of adrenaline still pumping through your system NTA.", "Gianas infertility has no bearing on her opinion and she should shut the hell up and keep it to herself.  NTA", "NTA-I can\u2019t have kids and if I could I wouldn\u2019t do some of the things that the parents in my family do but I also wouldn\u2019t be running my mouth about how what they\u2019re doing is wrong, unless it was harmful to the child, or how my children would be perfect.", "NTA\n\nTo shit on you while you're still visibly upset is such an Ah move.", "Her being infertile is irrelevant to the situation. There are other ways to have kids. NTA", "NTA There\u2019s a huge difference between a childless person asking a parent to control a misbehaving child and a childless person acting like they will be the perfect parent who will never have any issues. Not only are children a lot of emotional work but they are also so unpredictable in their behaviors. She\u2019s welcome to her opinions as long as she keeps them to herself, I guarantee the first time her own child (if she ends up adopting/ivf ) has a meltdown that she will crack like a case of eggs dropped from a skyscraper.", "NTA", "NTA. She really seems to love kicking parents when they\u2019re already down.", "NTA. I don't have kids, but that is by choice (sterilization because I have health issues). I think that women who are infertile are hypersensitive which may also explain some of the criticism she dishes out.", "NTA... you are doing amazing as a mum.  Its rough and unrewarding quite alot of the time and you don't need Mary poppins chiming in highlighting perfectly normal toddler behaviour/emotions and making out you are failing as you aren't.", "NTA all it takes is one second and kids run off into oblivion. I\u2019m not a parent but my best friend has two kids and I was shook when I realized how quickly they would take off sometimes. \n\nMy best workouts were chasing them around Chuck E. Cheese. It happens, and it\u2019s not a reflection of parenting. It\u2019s about all kids being track stars.", "Esh - Gia is being an asshole about her obviously extreme insecurity and jealousy, and you let your panic allow you to say something especially cruel to get her off your back when you could have just told her to fuck off", "ESH, leaning toward YTA - Time, place, and manner of your clapback, however justified you feel, was way out of line and petty. Your reaction to unsolicited advice is to make a deeply personal attack in retaliation. You set out to hurt her feelings, and it worked.", "YTA because you could have mentioned that Giana\u2019s behavior was bothering you and try to get her to stop making these comments around you. Your words were a low-blow\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that she is younger than you. She doesn\u2019t have the same experiences so sometimes it is best to tell yourself that she may not know better but may understand someday.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She got overtired and surprised us with some tantrums, she definitely ran off in a store once when I was babysitting and assumed I would never lose her! All kids have moments, and good parents have bad moments too. \n\nTruly, this woman sounds awful to be around, and you should work with your other family members to just limit your interactions with her, and to the extent you need to be around her, feel free to remind her of her own issues each time she gets on her high horse.", "NTA.

I hate people like Giana with a passion rivaling the sun. Here's the deal, most of us parents may have said \"I'll never let my kid do x, y or z\" before having kids and then guess what happens? We have them and we let them do x, y, and z plus a, b and c. There is no one perfect way to raise a child, if there was, they would've given us handbooks upon leaving the hospital.

If you had said, \"It's easy to be a perfect mom when you can't have kids,\" that might have made me think differently.  It's a lot different being a babysitter than being a parent.  I've been a nanny, a teacher, and a stay-at-home mom to 3 kids, so I have a lot of experience and education in child and adolescent development tantrums and pushing limits are part of the development and learning process for kids. Giana is delusional if she thinks her kids will never have a tantrum.  I'm strict, and my kids know that when I say no, that means no,  but I've still had to leave a full cart at the service desk and haul a couple of crying preschoolers out of Sam's Club because they weren't behaving.", "Watching my wifes sister go through this now.

It\u2019s be completely different if Giana didn\u2019t have this bad habit of criticizing other people\u2019s parenting. To continue to give her passes due to her infertility just isn\u2019t doing anyone any favors (including her, because it\u2019s enabling her to be this highly critical, unpleasant person nobody will want to be around). Could OP have maybe gone about it better? Sure, but I think anybody who is repeatedly poked eventually snaps with teeth.", "Yeah, you can't be upset about being infertile and people making comments about when you become a parent if you yourself constantly bring it up. NTA.", "I never said it was OK, which is why stated ESH first. I cannot speculate Gianna's intention. Insensitive surely, but we don't have her account to gauge intent.

That\u2019s not mentioned anywhere, just that she snapped\u2026", "It's literally the title of the post. She's asking if she's the AH for using someone's infertility against them in an argument about parenting.", "Except that she didn't explicitly say \"Don't talk to me about parenting because your infertile\". If you want to say you can't speculate about Giana's intentions, then you can't turn around and say that about OP since her ACTUAL comment didn't even mention her infertility, just that she doesn't currently have children. \n\nIt is VERY obvious from Giana's comments that they are targeted and meant to hurt. OP was defending herself against completely unwarranted comments."]}
