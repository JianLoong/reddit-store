{"id": 30902, "submission_id": "17ud4yc", "title": "AITA For wanting to skip my wife's family Thanksgiving because I need a break", "selftext": "My wife (38F) and I (38M) have 2 kids (6 & 4).  A little over a week ago, my wife came down with a virus that won't be named.  No one else in the family has gotten sick (we've tested multiple times) and we've pretty much secluded my wife to our bedroom.  I've been doing my best to keep things in order and I like to think I've been doing OK.  My wife has told me multiple times during the past week how grateful she is for me taking care of everything while she's sick and how I deserve a break to do something for myself once she starts to feel better.  \n\nYesterday morning, my wife woke up feeling much better and finally tested negative and by the end of the day she had no symptoms.  She still kept herself in our room most of the day just to be safe, but she did not require me to take care of her like I had been the previous few days.  \n\nLast night, she thanked me again for all that I did and again said that I deserve to take some time for myself.  I told her that I had been thinking about that and said that I would like to stay home by myself this coming Saturday to have some peace and quiet.  The issue is that Saturday is her family's Thanksgiving gathering because people have other plans for Thanksgiving Day.  \n\nShe did not like my idea one bit and told me that I can't skip her family Thanksgiving just because I want to have a quiet day at home.  I told her that she told me multiple times to take some time for myself and due to our schedule and other family commitments, this Saturday is the best chance for me to have time for myself until after the new year.  \n\nHer issues are that it's a long drive to her parent's house (3 hours) and they don't have space for us to stay overnight.  She doesn't want to make that drive with both kids by herself.  She also doesn't like the idea of me skipping a family gathering for no real reason other than wanting a break.  \n\nWe kind of argued about it and I told her that I don't like that she told me to find time for myself, only to go back on that and make it seem like I have to find time that is convenient and acceptable to her.  I told her I don't want to wait another 6 weeks to get time for myself.  \n\nShe asked me what I was going to do if I stayed home and I told her I would probably just stay at home in pajamas, watch college football, play video games, and maybe pop a couple edibles.  That set her off even more and she told me that if that's how I'm going to spend that time, then I need to come to her family Thanksgiving and find a more suitable time to do that sort of thing.   \n\nShe feels it isn't \"fair\" to stick her with the full stress of taking the kids on a long drive to a family gathering without me there to help.  I told her that if I'm only allowed to take time for myself when it's convenient for her, then she shouldn't tell me multiple times that I deserve a break.  I know if I just stay home she's going to be pissed.

She didn't choose when she got~~ *~~THE~~* ~~virus. Honestly, what you did was just being a good husband/father and is to be expected of you regardless. Remember your vows? \"~~*~~In sickness and in health.~~*~~\"~~\n\n~~Not to mention, how do you think this is going to make you look to her family? You're choosing yourself over EVERYONE, for no other reason than you want a break. That is next level selfish. You want a break? Don't pick a major holiday. Coordinate a sleepover for the kids, and ask your wife to have a girl's night. It's not that hard, my guy.~~\n\nEdit: OP in the comments said her family is racist towards him for being Indian. I wouldn't want to be around them either. Changing to NTA", "~~ESH~~\n\n* ~~You have a responsibility to your family.~~\n\n~~As a father sometimes you need to make sacrifices to attend family gatherings that you don't necessarily want to attend. It kind of feels like there's information you aren't telling us, leading me to believe you might not like your extended family.~~\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* ~~Your wife has a responsibility to you.~~\n\n~~Your wife very clearly isn't communicating with you on \"when\" you should be able to take this break. She needs to work with you to make an actual schedule so that you aren't forced into thinking a Holiday is the only day you have off.~~\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*EDIT\\*\n\nNTA\n\nFrom what you've said in the comments I'm now leaning towards NTA. There is clearly a toxic dynamic surrounding your extended family involving racial issues, and your wife is not respecting the fact that you need time to rest.\n\nThere are far too many YTA's here that stem from toxic masculine ideals. If you need a break cause you're burnt out, you need a break.\n\nThe nail in the coffin however, is that your wife has skipped out on YOUR family gatherings due to HER being burnt out or mentally unwell. So why are you not able to do the same?", "Interesting group here. OP wanted to stay home to recoup from a tiring week plus of caring for kids and a sick wife and household ( so dishes, garbage, clothes, laundry, food, meals,m etc) \n\nHe didn\u2019t bring up the racism card but most of you called him AH till it was mentioned. I don\u2019t know about you but when I\u2019m exhausted I  can\u2019t postpone my recovery for a more convenient time. And adding a social event, even a good one without racist family, would be too much. \n\nWhy does it have to be tit for tat? She got to take time off from a family event therefore he gets to?\n\nWhy can the man just take a break? NOW?! A week of a spouse in isolation, kids needing entertainment and care and I\u2019m fried thinking of it", "ORIGINALLY Y-T-A\n\n* EDITED due to updated information from OP *\nNTA\n\nTaking time isn\u2019t the same as skipping a family holiday. If you don\u2019t want to go to Thanksgiving, just say as much. Don\u2019t put it under the guise of taking time for yourself.\n\nWhen you\u2019re sick does your wife get to take a holiday off? This is kind of disingenuous and I think you know that.", "Why can't you all stay home together? She's just coming off being sick, it's perfectly understandable to skip a holiday meal, not drive 6 hours and be stressed after her being sick and you having to handle everything. NTA.", "NTA. If she, understandably, can't make that drive to Thanksgiving with her family with your kids, than she can stay at home too. Covid isn't easy but taking care of everything, including kids, while she recovered, also isn't and she acknowledged that. So, that being said, she knows you are burnout, she should let you decompress as promised", "Based on your comments of her parents being racists which is a relevant issue I will say NTA, I would have skipped just for that.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand everyone acting like 3 hours each way is an impossible road trip to do with your own kids. \n\nYou mentioned in a comment that her family is racist and there are definite tensions, so the only reason you'd go is to help your wife. But she'll be in a house full of her family, so except for the drive, you shouldn't be necessary anyway. \n\nYou need to focus on your mental health if you're feeling burnt out and overwhelmed.", "NTA. You have been doing lots of work and your wife has done the same before, skipping family events for a rest day.\n\nAlso, has your wife informed her family that she was sick and is still planning on coming over to see the rest of the family? Due to this time of year where illnesses get passed around early, the other family members should be made aware, especially if there are older or really young family members that could be at risk.", "NTA You've done so much for me you should take some time off for yourself. But do it under my terms, when it's convenient for me and meets my approval.", "Question, do you get Thanksgiving Day off? Can that be your quiet day?", "NTA - I think a stressful holiday for her  = 7 days of stress at home for him.", "Originally I was going to say YTA because it sounded like a cop out on the OP\u2019s part, especially considering it\u2019s a holiday gathering. However, after reading additional posts from OP that add a LOT more significance to the situation, the wife is the AH here. What\u2019s good for one should be good for the other. There\u2019s a lot going on in this family dynamic that needs to be addressed, and it\u2019s more that skipping out on the partner\u2019s holiday family gathering. Counseling is probably in order before this gets worse.", "NTA. She told you to find a day to rest, and you did.  Just because she didn't like the day doesn't mean you shouldn't take it.  No,  a three hour drive with the kids isn't fun.  But a three hour drive with small kids is never fun.", "NTA but your wife is one. I can\u2019t imagine if my wife forced me to be with racist in laws. I don\u2019t always like going to my in laws but they\u2019re very nice to me. I was NTA before I knew the racism they treated you with. This changes advice from how to compromise with your wife vs now and why would you stay with a spouse that completely disregards your feelings. That is very toxic of her and for me it would be a dealbreaker if my wife supported her racist family over me. It wouldn\u2019t even be a question and you NEED TO MAKE THIS A MUCH BIGGER DEAL She owes you respect and support and she is currently not providing you with that. Do not ever go to an event hosted by them again. If they ask you why, just tell them you felt unwelcome due to your skin color.", "Even without knowing her family is racist towards you,, and that she's skipped out family holidays, NTA. But as usual since it's the man posting most people calling you TA.\n\nYou've not had a break due to working. You've not had a break due to taking care of your sick wife and your kids.  Your wife says you can have a break, then back tracks. She then believes that what you're doing for your break isn't good enough, and so you should actually spend it with her family. You're allowed to take a single day off. \n\nIf it was a woman posting and saying she took care of her sick husband and wanted a day off, then everyone would be supporting her. As well as calling her husband an asshole for not being able to take care of the kids for 1 single day.", "Just remember this:  With some people, no good deed goes unpunished.", "Ehhh I\u2019m not big on family gatherings so I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to go\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. And if she didn\u2019t want you to pick this time for you break she should\u2019ve said after that , or at least meet in the middle like maybe leaving a bit earlier or something", "OP, I can truly appreciate the desire to have a short break. NTA for that! Your choice of days has created a bit of a kerfuffle though. Apparently your wife is uncomfortable driving six hours in one day with two young kids in the car, especially since three of those hours are after an exhausting gathering involving lots of eating along with heavy traffic on the drive. I expect she's anxious about making the trip alone. \n\nI wish I had a magic solution where you could have your free time to play at home, without family interruptions. I hope you two can negotiate one 12 to 24 hour period where you can putter around, stay in your jammies eat edibles & game to your heat's content. Edit to add: magic solution here; staying home on Thanksgiving might relax you but I suspect your wife will be max-frazzled. The payback might be really unpleasant.", "[deleted]", "YTA - she didn\u2019t give you a card to have free time whenever you want it. The break is fair but you need to find a time that works, not when it\u2019s time for a road trip with young kids.\n\nShe can\u2019t control getting sick. I get it, I never get that free time either and would kill for it, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t work like that when you already have plans", "YTA. You handled things solo for a week (which is not the hero move you seem to think it is), your partner fully expressed her appreciation, and now you\u2019re using this scenario to skip a major holiday. You know that\u2019s not what she meant.", "I didn\u2019t need any of the edits to vote NTA. Your wife\u2019s words were totally empty.", "Info:\n\n\nDid you ask your wife wich day she thinks would be a good day for your break?\n\n\n\nEdit: \n\n\nESE - you need a break, she isn't willing to comprimise.\n\n\n\nMy suggestion would be to get a sitter for sunday and she will do meal planning, grocery shopping, cleaning.", "NTA. You deserve a day off.  Yeah, it sucks that the only available day for approx 6 weeks is on a family event. Your wife agreed you should have a day off. She could do the drive. She just doesn't want to. She'd rather you do more. If you're exhausted, you're exhausted. What did she expect you to do aside from just vegging? You're going to be irritated during the drive and family Thanksgiving. Then she's going to be annoyed with you for that. You took care of everything while she was testing positive. She can handle the kids for her family visit.", "NTA, if your burnt out your burnt out. A day with the in-laws excited children and 6 hours of driving isn't going to change that.", "NTA. When are you going to have a day off if not during holidays? It just makes sense. No-one should feel obligated to travel and spend time with family.", "NTA. You all can stay at home if you want to. Or she can leave the kids with you at home if she is so hellbent on going. Thanksgiving is nothing but a day of gluttonous eating and resenting relatives.", "YTA. You can and should take a different day/days as your break. This is a family commitment. This isn\u2019t just you taking a break, it\u2019s you abandoning family, including your children, for the celebration of a holiday.", "It might be unusual, but do you have a family friend or regular sitter that could go with her? Both your points are valid. \n\nNAH", "NAH\n\n\nI think both of you need a better plan for making sure both of you get time without the kids.  Is a sitter once or twice a month in the budget?  Can the two of you cover for each other one evening a week so each parent gets to go do something without kids for a few hours in the evening?   Can you guys start putting weekend days on the calendar now for the first half/quarter of 2024 that will be alone days for each of you?\n\n\nMy husband and I have struggled with this two.  We have three kids.  Getting a date night is still hard but some things that have helped us include\n\nHim having a set night weekly where he does something with friends and I manage the kids.\n\nMe getting time every week either out of the house with friends or I just go to a coffee shop around the corner and read/self care, decompress.  \n\nSometimes alone time doesn't have to be expensive or fancy but just getting in the habit of making it happen is the first part", "YTA. Finding time for yourself doesn't have to be a full day all at once, and it definitely doesn't have to be a day where you taking time means she has to do a long, tiring drive with two small kids, deal with a family gathering where everyone is wondering why you aren't there, and do all that while she's still recovering from being ill. \n\nYou taking an evening where you go out with your buddies and she cares for the kids, or a day at th weekend where you get a long lie in and she copes with the kids might be appropriate,.\n\nAlso, what is planned for every single weekend and evening between now and the New Year? I find it heard to believe that there is genuinely no other possible time for you to take a few hours to yourself, or that there are n't other things you could cancel or shorten to carve out a bit of time.  Or , y'know, wait until the new year and plan a day.\n\nThus Saturday isn't free, you already have plans and commitments - why is this one so much less importnat that the other 'family plans and commitments' that you say are stopping you finding time this side of the holidays? \n\nAlso- your wife wasn't off enjoying herself, she was sick. Taking care of her and your kids is the bare minimum that you are expected to do in those circumstance. It's nice that she expressed her appreciation but you undermine it all if your reaction is to them demand she does something exhausting and taxing by herself, bail on a family celebration and bully her when she questions it.", "Changing vote to NTA. If the IL treat you badly you shouldn't be expected to go anyway. And if I were you I wouldn't want my children around them either. And it makes a huge difference that your wife dips out of holidays at your family events. From your original post it sounded like it was unheard of to do so in your family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOriginal Response: Taking time off for yourself and leaving your wife on a long car ride on a big holiday alone with the kids are two different things, especially since she's just getting over being sick. I'm sure you wouldn't want to corral your kids by yourself on Thanksgiving. And it's pretty crappy of you to say that she's going back on her word for not instantly giving you what you want, time off she offered for doing what you are supposed to be doing anyway. She's your wife, those are your kids and you are supposed to take care of them.", "YTA. Find time for your break that is not during a family obligation. I refuse to believe that you have already have plans for every single day from now until the new year.", "NTA. Tell her she and the kids can stay home and you will be doing your thing all day while she watches the kids.", "ESH you\u2019re not TA for not wanting to go to her family\u2019s, given how they treat you and your wife is TA for letting them treat you that way, but you are TA for using this as an excuse instead of just being honest with your wife about not wanting to be around her racist family and refusing to go at all.", "YTA- it\u2019s wonderful that you helped with everything but I do believe that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to be doing regardless.", "YTA for trying to use your free pass to skip out on her family\u2019s holiday celebration. It\u2019s unreasonable to have her drive 3 hours there and 3 hours back alone with 2 small children. She\u2019s not telling you that you can\u2019t take your day to yourself she\u2019s saying it\u2019s not a good day to take it that particular day. Also your absence will be noticed and then she\u2019ll have to explain to her family that you wanted a day off to yourself to play video games and take edibles and choose to do it that day instead of spending it with all of them. When choosing your day it should be a day that\u2019s convenient for both of you not you using it as an excuse to skip out on her family get together because you probably didn\u2019t even want to go to it in the first place.", "It's embarrassing for you to have to ask this.  You know damn well YTA here.  Holidays like Thanksgiving are off-limits for such requests.  Especially when you have 2 little kids like that.\n\nAnd your wife will be more than \"pissed\" if you stay home.", "YTA. \n\nYou don't deserve rewards for taking care of a sick partner. The reward is that your partner will do the same for you if you get sick. \n\nShe was the one who just went through an illness. She deserves a break too. Yet she's planning on going to Thanksgiving anyways. \n\nI'm sure she would like to have entire days off. Does she get those regularly? If not, maybe you could come up with a fair plan.", "YTA- you know this break doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t apply to a literal holiday when you have young kids, it\u2019s thanksgiving and there are several Saturdays till the new year. You\u2019re a dad and husband which is a full time 365 job, sir, grow up.", "NAH. You took care of everything for more than a week, you deserve some time off. \n\nI get why she is upset tho. She didn't expect to have to care for the 2 kids herself and do all the driving. It would have been way easier for her if you would have come.", "YTA - you knew this was not what she meant.", "ESH. You are entitled to a day off of watching TV, playing video games and popping a couple of edibles, just not on the day that your wife would have to drive 6 hours solo with two young kiddos and deal with family all day. \n\nShe should take the kids out of the house for most of a day on Friday or Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend and give you a full afternoon of uninterrupted time to yourself to just decompress. But you still have to go to the family Thanksgiving thing with her on Saturday. You don't get to dump that on her because she was sick.", "YTA. I find it hard to believe you can't find a less stressful day to take for yourself. She hasn't exactly been relaxing for the week, she's been sick. Find a different day.", "Why can\u2019t you take the Friday between your Thanksgiving and her Thanksgiving to have \u201cme\u201d time? Or the Sunday after? YTA for sure!", "You basically looked after your own home and children while your wife was ill and had to isolate. Well done \\*slow hand clap\\* Do the fam thing \\*for\\* your fam then take your rest day another time.", "YTA. \n\nYou're like a child OP, what are you 7 years old, trying to hang your hat on the fact that you wife didn't specifically say that the time to yourself shouldn't be during a family holiday? Get out of here with that nonsense, we all know, OP included, that his wife didn't mean skipping Thanksgiving dinner when she said this.", "I truly feel for you. HOWEVER, big holidays like thanksgiving are hard to bow out of especially when you have kids so I completely see her side with the long drive included. I would choose a couple other obligation days you have planned and ask her to pic one so you can have your chill day. If thanksgiving on sat is a no go for her I\u2019m sure the two of you can pick another gathering you can miss. You can both be flexible on this.\n\nUpdated-\nAfter reading your response to some of the comments, you deserve Saturday off. NTA if she\u2019s phoned it in before on the events you mentioned you should absolutely be able to take your day. She\u2019s being unfair and this is a double standard.", "NAH.\n\nI totally get you wanting and needing a break and wanting to take that break from in-laws who maybe aren't your favorite people, as indicated by your comments. \n\nBut I also totally get not wanting to take 2 kids on a holiday road trip alone. \n\nI feel choosing a holiday to skip instead of a different random Saturday was pretty heavy-handed of you. Yes,  she said you need a break, and I'm sure she meant it, but most partners are not going to choose one of the most stressful parenting days of the year to take that break. You'd also be skipping a holiday with your kids and I certainly wouldn't love if my husband did that. \n\nWhat's the alternative then? She could stay home,  which would ruin your break day. Or you can choose another day. \n\nIt sucks but I recommend just choosing another day.", "YTA. A family holiday isn\u2019t something you miss just because you want time off. Find another way to have time for yourself. It\u2019s also important to be with your kids on holidays in my opinion. It wouldn\u2019t feel like thanksgiving to me if my spouse didn\u2019t attend, and having to explain to family why they didn\u2019t show up without hurting their feelings would be awkward. She was being kind by telling you she appreciated you by letting you know she\u2019d like you to have time off, she didn\u2019t expect you to not attend thanksgiving. Also it\u2019s not really a big deal that you had to take care of her while she was sick, that\u2019s what spouses do for each other.", "YTA.\n\nOf course she didn't expect you to skip out on a family holiday event when she suggested taking time off.  Outrageous dude.\n\nYou need to step up and be a good spouse here.", "YTA. wow while raising my sons and one of us got sick of course the other shouldered more responsibility and it swung the other way when the other person got sick. It's called being a good parent and spouse. Of course we'd thank the other one for their extra contribution but I don't remember either of us saying you deserve some time to yourself. You're a parent. Want time for yourself don't have kids.", "YTA.  That's six hours of driving with two small children in the car. Do you really want her to be driving them home when she's tired after a long day of driving and having a heavy holiday meal?  It sucks, but you should go and figure out another day for your down time.\n\nIs there any reason you can't have Sunday as your day?", "YTA. \n\nYou're leaving her by herself with the kids for practically an entire day, with a 3 hour drive there and back. Yeah, you deserve a break after all you have done, but come on, dude, this is not fair. You guys were at home when she was sick, plus I'm sure the kids were at school during the weekday. Pick any other day or weekend. There's no way you can be super booked up from now until the new year.", "NTA", "NTA. You supported her breaks, she can support yours.", "NTA", "Who the fuck subjects a 4 and 6 year old to 6 hours in the car for a meal? YTA for that", "YTA. Hugely. You can have a break any other time. You\u2019re being a petulant child.", "Yes,  YTA\n\nHaving made long drives with kids and dealt with family all day only to drive back, I know the kind of day your wife is looking at.  \nWhile you may think,  drive,  eat,  schmooze, drive.  She is thinking about the food she'll have to prepare,  pack up,  everything she has to pack to keep kids happy on a 3 hour drive to and from,  and while there,  probably a change of clothes for everyone,  bringing home leftovers,  talking to family for hours,  cleaning up.... the mental load is exhausting. Without a partner you're asking her to do the work of three people.  It's a lot.  \nI'm sure she thought when she said to find some time for yourself she was thinking you'd hang out with some friends and watch a game.... while she carried on with her norm. I don't think she thought during one of the most hectic times of family life you'd just ghost her to have a scratch-n-sniff day. \n\nThere's a certain amount of bombastic pretentiousness to your ask.", "YTA. Oh, come on. You HAVE to know that taking a day to yourself isn\u2019t going to happen on a family holiday. Come on.", "YTA. Just because you deserve some free time doesn't mean you can take it whenever you want - especially on a day that a family event was already planned.", "YTA. You are almost gleefully subjecting your wife to some incredibly difficult and stressful solo parenting around the holidays when you yourself didn't do anything special. You acted like a husband and a dad which are both roles you signed up for on an ongoing basis. Here's how that conversation is going to go down at the Thanksgiving table:\n\n\"Oh, where's tgivingbreak this year?\"\n\n\"At home resting.\n\n\"Oh no, is he ill?!\n\n\"No Mom, I got unavoidably sick last week so he had to dad and as a reward for taking care of his family, he's now he's at home getting high and watching football because he doesn't like my side of the family enough to visit.\"\n\nYou do deserve a break. Solo parenting is rough. That can be true while it also being true that you shouldn't bail out on existing family obligations.  YTA if you can just send your wife on a 6hr round trip with two kids. You need to find a better place for self-care, maybe an hour or two here and there, rather than punishing your wife.", "YTA\r  \n\r  \nCome on, you know you are with this and that it's being downright selfish. You're also punishing your wife for getting so sick, as if that's somehow her fault. Now you justified dumping her with what sounds like a 6 hour round trip car ride alone with young children, for a major holiday event no less.  \r  \n\r  \nLook, I know having kids is exhausting sometimes, especially when one parent is down for the count, but you're an adult. Act like one.", "ESH. You're both approaching issue as against one another, rather than trying to figure out a reasonable compromise.", "I'm all for skipping holidays if you don't feel like it, I've done it so many times and my husband doesn't care. But skipping a holiday is not the same thing as leaving your partner with driving 3 hours with two small children. So YTA", "I'm going with YTA regardless. If the racism you've put out there was really an issue why is your wife's illness your reason you're making this your hill to die on and not her families behavior? Which also should have been a conversation and addressed way before now. Why are your children still going to their home? Assuming they are your biological children they are half Indian as well and shouldn't be in a racist environment either. So you're just okay protecting yourself and not your kids? If this is truly the reason send your wife without the kids.\n\nIt seems in every comment you have some kind of excuse or other new reason you're putting out there. I honestly think you just want to shirk your responsibilities for a day to be a lazy ass and get high leaving your wife in a shitty position which would generally be okay except the leaving your wife in a shitty position part. Guess what dude having kids is exhausting. When you're married and your partner is sick it's generally the idea that the other spouse takes on a bit more to care for the home and children. It's a partnership and now your wife is to expect the next time she's sick she shouldn't count on you because it will come at a greater price to her. That's not a marriage. That's teaching your wife she's better off not counting on you. It doesn't get any easier and sometimes you have to suck it up but you seem very inflexible making this the only day you're willing to sacrifice any plans/events so I have to go with YTA on the basis that if any of your other issues were really valid they would have been addressed and dealt with at the time they occurred. You said yourself...she didn't want to go to a cousin's wedding in the past and you didn't make a big deal about it...that leads me to believe it wasn't that important to you. Your wife is telling you this is important to her and you seem to care about getting high and watching sports more. That should tell her all she needs to know.", "YTA.

I think everyone in the family will understand if you all skip Thanksgiving this year, that way she won\u2019t have to drive by herself.

What are the chances she could get a hotel room? Maybe one with a pool, if the weather allows for it where you are. Or some other small fun excursion on the way back.

You both have good points.  \n\nI'm in your corner, but 3 hours driving each way with 2 kids is a lot and that's the only reason you might be the asshole because you staying home could deprive your wife and children with a family gathering they care about.

A little over a week ago, my wife came down with a virus that won't be named.  No one else in the family has gotten sick (we've tested multiple times) and we've pretty much secluded my wife to our bedroom.  I've been doing my best to keep things in order and I like to think I've been doing OK.  My wife has told me multiple times during the past week how grateful she is for me taking care of everything while she's sick and how I deserve a break to do something for myself once she starts to feel better.  \n\nYesterday morning, my wife woke up feeling much better and finally tested negative and by the end of the day she had no symptoms.  She still kept herself in our room most of the day just to be safe, but she did not require me to take care of her like I had been the previous few days.  \n\nLast night, she thanked me again for all that I did and again said that I deserve to take some time for myself.  I told her that I had been thinking about that and said that I would like to stay home by myself this coming Saturday to have some peace and quiet.  The issue is that Saturday is her family's Thanksgiving gathering because people have other plans for Thanksgiving Day.  \n\nShe did not like my idea one bit and told me that I can't skip her family Thanksgiving just because I want to have a quiet day at home.  I told her that she told me multiple times to take some time for myself and due to our schedule and other family commitments, this Saturday is the best chance for me to have time for myself until after the new year.  \n\nHer issues are that it's a long drive to her parent's house (3 hours) and they don't have space for us to stay overnight.  She doesn't want to make that drive with both kids by herself.  She also doesn't like the idea of me skipping a family gathering for no real reason other than wanting a break.  \n\nWe kind of argued about it and I told her that I don't like that she told me to find time for myself, only to go back on that and make it seem like I have to find time that is convenient and acceptable to her.  I told her I don't want to wait another 6 weeks to get time for myself.  \n\nShe asked me what I was going to do if I stayed home and I told her I would probably just stay at home in pajamas, watch college football, play video games, and maybe pop a couple edibles.  That set her off even more and she told me that if that's how I'm going to spend that time, then I need to come to her family Thanksgiving and find a more suitable time to do that sort of thing.   \n\nShe feels it isn't \"fair\" to stick her with the full stress of taking the kids on a long drive to a family gathering without me there to help.  I told her that if I'm only allowed to take time for myself when it's convenient for her, then she shouldn't tell me multiple times that I deserve a break.  I know if I just stay home she's going to be pissed. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
