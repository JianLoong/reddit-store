Or a lesser problem than one a fat person deals with (and I'm a fat person saying this)", "Sounds like she is complaining about repeatedly getting hit in the face by a door she has to use everyday, not just being skinny. Unless she made comments about your size YTA. I think you should probably apologize and explain the insecurities it brought up for you because she might not really understand why you snapped at her.", "YTA. If I were her.. I would feel so blindsided by your remark. It would seem to come SO out of nowhere I wouldn\u2019t say anything and go quiet as well. \nAlso, as someone who is ROUTINELY told to eat a cheese burger and pulled to the side and asked straight up if I have an ED  AND I DON\u2019T - it\u2019s really offensive. Equally as offensive as someone saying \u201cshould you really eat that.. I don\u2019t think you need the calories.\u201d to someone they think is overweight.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like she connected her being smaller to her not being picked up by the sensors. You made that connection on your own and it shows that you are insecure about sizes. I\u2019m a big woman too and I am insecure about it but I don\u2019t let how I feel about myself stop me from being empathetic to others.", "YTA\n\nDoes she complain about her weight? Or does she complain about a sensor who doesn't pick her up because it's not made well and thus proceeds to smash her face almost always? \n\nIt's not about the weight. It's not a stab at you, it's about the stupid door.", "YTA. Your insecurities are showing.", "How often would you complain if the doors didn't open because of your size or weight and you walked into them? YTA.", "YTA - You're projecting your feeling about being fat on to her. Sounds like jealousy.", "yta:/ i understand how its annoying to hear about the same stuff everyday, but its normal to complain about something that happened seconds before. if she brings up the fact that shes so skinny every time id say maybe theres a weird intent there, but if shes just venting about it to you as her friend i dont see why her being thin matters?", "Info: Did she ever complain that the door doesn't pick up skinny people, or did she just complain about the door not opening?\n\nBecause if the latter, you literally just came at her projecting your own insecurities about your weight. If you're insecure about it, there are healthy ways to change that. Otherwise, you're just being an ass to a friend. Skinny privilege is a real thing, but she wasn't being rude to you about weight, nor does it sound like she was thinking about it at all.", "YTA.\n\nThe concept of body positivity applies all ways.", "I would suggest that she complain to maintenance and anyone else she can think of. The sensor may need adjusting. Those sensors should work for children.", "YTA she wasn\u2019t bringing it up randomly just being upset about it when it happened (which I would be too hitting a door sucks and it\u2019s embarrassing)", "YTA. \n\nIf those doors didn\u2019t open because of your size, you would complain, too.", "YTA.\n\nYour approach was rude and quite unnecessary. There are politer ways of handling this situation. On the other hand, hearing the same thing constantly everyday is very annoying - even more so if it's inadvertently bringing up your own insecurities. \n\nNevertheless, since you were so explosive, I think you should apologize to your friend and just explain why you got so agitated. Chances are she didn't mean it the way you thought she meant it. If she has to go through that door everyday with struggle, it's understandable why she would complain.", "YTA...", "YTA. What if something you had to  use multiple times a day didn't work because you're larger & your friend yelled at you for being frustrated about it? You sound mad at her for being skinny. That's a you problem.", "YTA. It\u2019s called body shaming", "YTA. You are jealous that she's skinny. People can have issues that you have nothing to do with you, y'know. Just because the sensors don't bother you doesn't mean they aren't an inconvenience for her.", "YTA, you could deliver how you feel in a better way. By telling someone to \u201cshut up\u201d is immature & leaves people wondering, why?? Also it\u2019s aggressive. If that\u2019s your friend why don\u2019t you say how you feel respectfully?", "YTA, sorry. You could have gone about that differently. I understand it could\u2019ve been annoying, especially when she feels the need to bring it up every time, but there are nicer ways to go about things.", "YTA. She's complaining about an actual problem and while hearing that every day can get annoying you very clearly only got annoyed to that point because it's caused by her being skinny. It sounds like you have some insecurities to work out, and this is coming from a fat girl.", "YTA. Skinny people aren\u2019t always healthy, and if she can\u2019t enter a building bc the sensor doesn\u2019t detect her weight, that\u2019s an actual problem. She\u2019s complaining bc she wants something to be done about it.\n\nSociety\u2019s views on weight SUCK. They\u2019re almost always wrong, whether you\u2019re skinny or not.\n\nAt the very least, you could explain how your insecurities are highlighted when she complains about her weight, but also realize your insecurities are a You problem, not hers.\n\nYou should apologize to her and have a heart to heart.", "YTA, I have one smaller friend, she is complaining about similar problems and rightfully so. I woud complain too if I woud run into doors on daily basis because of poorly set sensor. Or being ignored by elevator just because  being too light and when  alone in there it woud switch off the lights and other people calls you to random floors. That's pretty valid reasons to complain.", "Yta", "Info: when she complains about the sensors, does she always correlate the problem with her size? \nAlso, has she ever made any comments about your appearance? \nJust trying to understand why you took her complaining so personally.", "I would let my girl read this post and educate her not to be a mean person like OP. What\u2019s the big deal??", "YTA. It sounds like you\u2019re projecting on Rebecca because you\u2019re insecure. Nothing in your post indicates she\u2019s mentioned her weight as a factor at all. \n\nAlso, does Rebecca happen to have darker skin than you? Because it\u2019s VERY unlikely she\u2019s so teeny tiny the door sensor doesn\u2019t pick her up, but cameras discriminating based on skin color is a well known phenomenon", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's not mad that she's skinny. She's mad that door doesn't work for her.

People who are on the more slender side also have trouble with their weight it's not just people who might be on the heavier side it's just when you're slender it just doesn't get to talk about as much because it's more socially acceptable to be that way.

You should have spoken up sooner if this was irritating you, in a less confrontational way.  Your friend does have a valid complaint, but griping about it EVERY day without trying to do anything about it would be annoying as Hell.", "I'm going against the grain and saying ESH. \nIt's hard, as a larger person, to hear people complain about being skinny. It's also hard to be a skinny person because everyone thinks being skinny is so awesome, though it does have its disadvantages. I think you and your friend just need to have a heart to heart talk.", "YTA.\n\nFYI - being too small has problems just like being too big. Both sizes can be linked to disordered eating and health complications. Both sizes can lead to being judged by strangers. Both sizes can cause insecurities. Both sizes can be hard for the individual to change.\n\nSomeone being different and wanting to vent to their friends is not a dig at the different friends. It\u2019s feeling safe and wanting to get something off their chest.\n\nAlso they may have not associated getting hurt (which is probably what is happening every time they hit the door) with being small.\n\nThis is like yelling at a larger person who has to duck going through doors, or can\u2019t fit through one.\n\nDo some self reflection.", "Wow why were you so mean?

She keeps running into the door. No matter why, that\u2019s still an annoying, and potentially dangerous issue.

This in no way makes the skinner person an arsehole. Furthermore, as others have pointed out, op equated the complaint to weight themselves, not their friend in the first place. You cannot expect people to not talk about mundane or inoffensive things because someone might be insecure about something completely different themselves. smh", "It sounds like this is more of someone complaining about literally running into a door constantly because it doesn't function properly for them than a an actual weight/body size complaint all the time.", "\u201cugh i hate the sensors not working\u201d does not equate to \u201cugh im so tiny and skinny\u201d"]}
