Creationism isn't quite the same since anyone who pays attention and has a brain knows it's nonsense, but East Asian history is not as widely known outside of East Asia.  My field is one where people think they know what's going on because it's always in the news, but as we all know, news is not exactly a reliable or accurate and unbiased source of information. Going to a bookstore or looking at bookstore websites is a series of nope, nope, nope, nope 20 times over and then one yep and then back to the nopes series.

And they\u2019re TA despite very adamantly letting us all know that they did make a mistake in the comments. Now I\u2019m seeing that other harmless comments made you angry enough to argue", "Would you mind pointing towards a review or source that describes the controversy?", "I wonder if a book about the worlds' second most controversial country's many historical mass killings would be controversial. hmmmm...", "Sounds Like Brother perceives it as the worst possible books a layperson could read as a introduction to the subject, but If he feels that strongly about it, He could, and SHOULD, have told both his teen son and his middle-aged sibling THAT He disapproves of it and a very short/simple explanation of WHY, BEFORE it came Up.", "Are you a chinese historian?

By legitimately controversial I simply meant that qualified people will disagree, not necessarily that there has been a dramatic public controversy about it.

There's a difference.", "You might want to consult a dictionary about what \"ad hominem\" actually means. And no, I am not insulted.
