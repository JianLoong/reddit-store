Creationism isn't quite the same since anyone who pays attention and has a brain knows it's nonsense, but East Asian history is not as widely known outside of East Asia.  My field is one where people think they know what's going on because it's always in the news, but as we all know, news is not exactly a reliable or accurate and unbiased source of information. Going to a bookstore or looking at bookstore websites is a series of nope, nope, nope, nope 20 times over and then one yep and then back to the nopes series.

You can learn lies and become prejudiced quite easily in the right scenario.

There are certain particular points, like the death toll, that are controversial.\n\nIt isn't \"controversial\" the way David Irving is on the Holocaust, which is to say, mainstream historians think it's bullshit.", "That is not hownit works. Mostly because readers of popular work do not engage in research. He could became historian himself or start to be super interested in period, but both are equally likely to start with accurate books.\n\nThe biggest issue is that when you read bullshit, you tend to remember bs and not remember where it came from.\n\nInaccurate histories are no gains and don't add anything to anything. That does not mean they should be censored, but it means that the \"this is great opportunity\" argument is just naive wishful thinking.", "GTFO", "My friend, the world is bigger than the alleyways of Paris, New York, London and Stockholm. In any case, isn't it an irony that the tables have turned in terms of who produces the most BS?", "Is a bit of a sweeping statement I'll admit. But it is important to understand that there are many \"historians\" like Dikotter who are much more interested in creating a narrative around certain history than actually making an attempt to try and objectively analyse history. If you're going to read a book on history to learn more as hobby (and not to critically analyse how false historical narratives are created and maintained) then there is hundreds of other books that would do the job better.", "Idk man, this is reddit. You think people don't omit info all the time on subs like this?", "It's hit or miss. Inspiring interest in a subject is one thing, propagandizing with showtunes (\u00e0 la Hamilton or Evita) that become the popular narrative easily overwhelming more accurate/balanced/dissenting voices is another.\n\nIf the day comes where Lin Manuel's spiritual successor Schoolhouse Rocks Ronald Reagan or Netanyahu, or some alternate universe Andrew Lloyd Weber drops a pro-Thatcher musical, or someone choreographs a silly \"King George from Hamilton\" type number about 9/11 or the '90s Troubles, think about who & what institutions would be served by those messages, and think about how it would feel to have witnessed & lived the histories being drowned out by state-serving song.\n\nArt loosely about real life can still seriously impact how that real life is accurately or inaccurately perceived. That doesn't mean we can't have fun, or even get into parody or caricature or take artistic license, but it does mean if sing-along fanfiction even potentially has the power to affect education, engagement with the world at large, public sentiment, and policy, creators of that type of media do have a responsibility & accoubtability for how that power is steered and what its greater impact is.\n\nAnd as audiences, *everybody* has a responsibility to engage with \"true\" stories differently & more critically than we would with pure creative fiction, including scrutinizing accuracy, if only so we aren't bamboozled when blatant propaganda does in fact come along.", "Which is why I said it\u2019s a valuable moment for his dad to teach him why it\u2019s inaccurate and how to fact check, etc lmao\n\nYou\u2019re not even disagreeing with my point but you seem to think you are.", "Powerful men such as former Secretaries of State with overblown salaries in cushy offices, most of them with one or more war crimes to their names, me an impoverished young blonde woman with a genius i.q. who'd risen purely on hard work and there to do research, and sick of being ogled, groped, dismissed, and condescended to by the old lechers who all thought they were so much smarter than the rest of us.  Take a look at the world today and I think you'll agree that they were not all that smart or that ethical or really, someone anyone with a lick of common sense or decency would want to share an elevator car with.  Or their lickspittle minions who imagined that because they were assistants to some self-appointed Great Man or other were also somehow above the rest of us, while they did the dirty work the Great Men would always deny deny deny, or mysteriously not be able to remember in a Congressional hearing.", "I just realized you have revolutionary in your name, what did I expect from someone like you, go back to posting on /r/antiwork or something", "The reason I commented was because I saw your username at multiple points in this thread, trying to shut down conversations by waving your academic credentials/academic terminology around. I agree that history belongs to the people, but your own actions were literally antithetical to that, because you were just focused on using your own degree (in a completely different field \u2013 if it wasn\u2019t, you would have corrected me) to uphold your own viewpoints as the only correct path. Maybe my comment was strongly worded, but as someone who actually works in the field of history, I don\u2019t view it as \u201cfragility\u201d to stand up against people trying to shut down other people in favor of their own biases. \n\nBut look, I\u2019m willing to hear you out. Tell me what makes you support Dikotter\u2019s work so fiercely? What about the points he\u2019s making inspires such ardent defence? Or \u2013 and I suspect this is true \u2013 have you not read Dikotter\u2019s work, and you\u2019re just defending it in a knee jerk fashion because it aligns with your (scholarly unrigorous) preconceptions? (For the record, my problem with his work is his tendency to ascribe different intentions to famines pre- and post-1949; ones before are almost always presented as accidents whereas those after are labeled as intentional. I think this is because he is focused on creating a particular narrative rather than exploring the actual complexity of these events. That being said, I do think his additions to understanding the category of resistance are interesting.)\n\n(Also, this is ancillary to my main point, but I can\u2019t stop laughing at how you\u2019ve called me an Ivy Tower elite and a nobody at a no-name state institution in the same comment. Pick an insult lane, buddy.)", "You make no sense.", "It\u2019s possible. I\u2019m just going by my own experience which is that academic people like to rest their insufferable butts on a very high horse", "My biggest takeaway from this is that people would 100% enjoy watching a Hamilton type musical about 9/11.", "Nah, dad can teach him about inaccurate histories without this moment. Nothing valuable about it.", "History is very nuanced. Generally speaking, the truth is somewhere in the middle. I personally wouldn't trust a source claiming something is incorrect unless they can cite what section is incorrect and cite me where the correct information can be found.", "GTFO, fash", "Actually, I think I do. Maybe you ought to expand your horizons.", "They absolutely would.\n\nMel Brooks isn't always right on *everything*, but that aspect of \"The Producers\" was a stone cold truth\u2014 you can spoon feed even the most grotesque propaganda into willing mouths if they can laugh or sing along while you do it, and you can rake in millions to do it.", "wrong this is a very important and valuable moment. Dad can use this as a jumping off point to teach.", "I am not even right wing and you post on /r/antiwork sub, I didn't even have to check, I just knew you did lmao"]}
