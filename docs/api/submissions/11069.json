In fact, as a side job, he designs his own line of latex clothing/pieces.

I'm guessing it bothered her because I'm into latex and similar clothing and knows I have a lot of pieces like that, but it never escalated and our relationship didn't really deteriorate enough though I was somewhat closer with her boyfriend than before.\n\nIt all turned sour two days ago when her boyfriend asked me my size and later on gave me one of his latex designs as a random gift. He knows I'm a huge Ariana Grande fan and he made me a latex bra with her ( Ariana Grande\u2019s) name on it I wasn't expecting the gift nor there was a reason for it but I rlly appreciated it. She found out about it because he posted a picture of me wearing the gift on his account and post it to showcase it because he made it.\n\nOut of nowhere, my friend and a couple of others in our group of friends started attacking me in our group chat.

You slide by \"he asked my size\" pretty quickly but you need cup, band, and shoulder measurements to make a good fitting bra, nevermind a latex one. I need further clarification on what measurements he asked you for bc bra measurements are super specific and unless he fashioned a sports bra style for you he couldn't have gone off a \"small, medium, or large\"", "YTA because latex gear falls into kink territory, and by bonding over a shared kink/exchanging kink related gifts, you are overstepping the gf\u2019s boundaries.

A bra (regardless of what it's made of) is a super intimate gift.

Way less intimate and unlikely to be perceived as sexual/crossing a line.\n\nI don't think you're assholes for bonding over a shared interest but I think *he's* an AH for making something so intimate for you, and for subsequently being so dismissive of his girlfriend's feelings about it. \n\nYou knew she harboured some discomfort about you growing closer (assumedly over this hobby) and yet you figured it wouldn't be an issue to send your bra size over, and then send him a photo of you posing in it.

After he gave you the gift, you should\u2019ve used some foresight in the optics of him posting a photo of you in it. Yes he probably was professional but come on, you\u2019re his gf\u2019s friend too. No one wants their boyfriend looking at their friends in a bra. Your friends are also AHs for attacking you in the chat, that\u2019s just immature.", "INFO: how did this happen in terms of the gift and show. He obviously gave it to you. Did he send it to you? Turn up at your house with it? And how did he get a picture? Did you post it on your sm and he reposted it? I\u2019m asking to determine is this a business transaction, he knows you like this stuff, he made it, you wore it and now he has a model and pics in return. Or did he do it as a friend / personal gift (which let\u2019s remember it is a bra and very personal) and you\u2019ve been sharing pictures directly with him.

That's crossing so many normal boundaries, along with the fact that latex clothing is most commonly known for being related to sexual kinks. She shouldn't have called you names and her boyfriend is also an asshole and himself flirting with danger here, but how can you really say that at no point during your interactions with him did you think that maybe, just MAYBE this would make your friend uncomfortable? I think you knew exactly what you were doing and you did it on purpose.", "ESH.  Your friend went over the line attacking you in group chat, but her boyfriend made you a bra.

Yeah, I can\u2019t entirely blame your friend for being upset that her boyfriend was posting a picture of you wearing the special bra that he made for you.

First off the bra I\u2019m assuming is from Dangerous Woman, which Ari struts on stage with. You could wear it as a normal top, it just has the name because presumably it had built in cups. Second the photo, just seems like how a tattoo artists displays their work on insta after they finish, and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve seen ass and boobs tats on them. Now your friend did express some discomfort about this topic, but as a lot of people point out that latex is a kink, yes it can be part of it, but some people just like to wear it. Seems similar to body con fashion. Also friend is the AH for slut shaming, seems a bit insecure.

If the piece came out nicely, I can understand him posting it so it generates business but ffs he shouldn't have you modeling it. \n\nHe needs to apologize to her.

YOU are majorly TA and any girl hearing this and your lack of understanding or empathy is going to be leery of you now and if I was even just another friend I would be like wtf.", "So you sent him a picture of you wearing a bra?\n\nAnd you think that would go over well with his gf?\n\nWhat are you smoking?", "OP I feel like reddit is not a good place for this, there are a lot of conservative values around relationships and sexuality to the point where anything that could be connected to something sexual is seen a threat to a  relationship.", "Gifting someone other than your partner intimate clothing isn't professional in any universe.", "You don\u2019t send your friends boyfriend pics of you in underwear, totally inappropriate.", "lol pls you know exactly what you\u2019re doing, drop the act.", "Lol so as long as it\u2019s his job, it\u2019s fine? If his side job was making dildos and he gifted you a custom one, would you send him a video of you using it?\n\nNo, of course not, because there is a line, and that\u2019s obviously over it. So is sending a picture of you wearing a bra to your friend\u2019s boyfriend. \n\nYTA", "What is a \u201cprofessional gift\u201d?", "Ah yes, a super professional interaction that involves you prancing around in latex lingerie in front of your friends boyfriend. \n\n\nIt sounds much more like you're hoping they break up, and if they do you two will probably be hooking up within a week.", "Your friends boyfrirnd is gifting you fetishwear/ lingerie, and you sent him back a picture of you wearing it. You really can't see how you're a complete AH?", "I'm a nurse and I have seen and touched about 5000 penises for work. I would never touch my best friends husbands penis. Ok? If he did have an issue and wanted me to look at something, it would be at my friends request and with her in the room. I don't care how \"professional\" you are. There are lines.", "Don\u2019t be obtuse now", "you are so transparent. stop acting like you don't understand. if you're so desperate for attention that you need taken men to boost your ego, accept that you're the asshole.", "Pleassseee you knew exactly what you were doing don't act nieve. you should never have accepted a gift like that in the first place especially after your friend told you she was uncomfortable about the cosiness of you and her bf's friendship. Then you go a send him a picture of you in a bra lol she should dump the pair of you.", "Girl don\u2019t play dumb lol it\u2019s a bra. A piece of latex lingerie and you\u2019re still sitting here like \u201cwhaaaat i don\u2019t get it??\u201d. Just say you like your friends bf and move on lol", "He gave you a custom latex bra. \n\nYou can\u2019t be this obtuse.", "delusional", "YTA On what planet is a LATEX BRA a professional gift?! You are obviously TA here OP.", "Haha I just got gifted a custom made dildo from a friend's boyfriend. I sent him a picture of it in use to show how much I love it and how well it fits.\n\nIt's not inappropriate, it was just professionalism. He knew I loved a specific shape, as for how he knew? I told him in a  professional way.\n\n\nFFS get over yourself. Your comfort level and his do not mean your friend has to stoop to that level especially when most of the modern world do not share the same views as the two of you. Disgusting friend (I mean you)", "He made her a *bra*. If it was latex leggings or maybe a dress (depending on the style) I wouldn\u2019t immediately jump to kink. But he made this woman latex lingerie, and she sent him a picture of her wearing it. And both of them invalidate the gf\u2019s *completely justified* discomfort over the intimate gestures.", "She still sent him photos of her wearing the gift regardless. OP is definitely the AH.", "You clearly haven\u2019t seen a fashion show or awards show. Celebs wear latex clothing a lot on red carpets even. Latex clothing on its own is not a kink or sexual", "That\u2019s a good point.", "Plenty of people wear these kind of things out to clubs. I have quite a few friends who do. But still i go back to my point that this is litterly his business. He makes these for a living. Its pretty common in the rave/festival community. Her friend is simply jealous because she was becoming close with the boyfriend over something she views as sexual. And even if it is a kink to her  plenty of people enjoy having people to talk to about these kind of things. Doesnt mean they wanna fuck them.", "Haha, YTA though. It\u2019s incredibly rude sending photos that inappropriate to someone\u2019s boyfriend. Especially after she was expressing discomfort. Leave him be already, just leave. It\u2019s disrespectful to their relationship and you\u2019re crossing huge boundaries.", "And a bra as a gift in February = Valentine\u2019s Day\u2026. \ud83d\udc40", "I would argue the opposite. Compared to society as a whole? This place has a pretty lax view on relationships. If OP wants to know whether the majority of people she would run into would think she's an AH, it's a decent start. It's not \"Would the people in my social circle think I'm an AH?\"", ">No, of course not\n\nBold of you to assume she wouldn't...", "The dude gets women to (1) tell him their boob sizes and (2) send sexy pictures to him. Dude is super gross and kind of impressive in his commitment to the con.", "Honestly I get this as a designer, Honestly if your dating a guy who makes latex lingerie you need to have a better strength for stuff like this.\n\nObviously this shouldn't have been a secret or surprise for the gf yo discover so yeah YTA. But in truth, if the girls can't handle this situation, she shouldn't be dating a guy with a hobby like this in the first place. \n\nThe friend needs to stop acting like this is normal tho, she may feel like a badass in it but alot of people have a sexual association with black latex, she needed to communicate with her friend about that before the photoshoot and the bf should have run the gift past his gf.", "I'll rewrite the title: AITA for willingly participating in my friend's bf's kink against her wishes?", "Doesn\u2019t really sound like lingerie if it says Arian grande across it. All these people seem to forget that women wear crop tops and bralets as shirts these days.", "Legit people go outside wearing lacy lingerie body suits with jeans and call it an outfit so it's nothing new and crazy tbh", "Yeah, latex dresses were very popular a few years back, like Kim K\u2019s dresses. But a bra seems like a push over a line.", "I guess you are right then. It's not a thread acting upon some kind of approved ethic code, just society norms.", "It's not gross to have a job that entails making lingerie. What? You sound like a Puritan with a high fever.", "I think it's less the latex that's the issue and more the bra aspect of the gift. If he had made her a black latex skirt I personally would be more understanding of her side. If he liked making clothes from burlap sacks and sent her a bra made from burlap sack then I would still think she's the asshole (along with the boyfriend). I feel very sorry for the girlfriend that both her friend and her boyfriend are trampling over her boundaries and making out like she's an unreasonable prude for being upset.", "Ok but my point was more like, if your boyfriends hobby was non latex bras, would you expect him to design a skirt if that's not his hobby. Her boyfriend designs sexual items, why would he make a skirt? If your not ok with your bfs hobby that's going to be an issue in their relationship.\n\nTheir the AH to ME for not communicating, finding out the boundaries, because if I choose to date someone who designs bras I know most of my friends would want them, that normal in MY world, same with my actual friend who designs sex toys. It's something I'd obviously consider when choosing to get in a relationship with this person. I understand others don't feel the same way that why they are an AH for not talking to her."]}
