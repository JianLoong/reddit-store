But sometimes you just explode with your feeling when you are genuinely concerned.\n\nSo.. here is the question.. can you look at your kids objectively? Do they need help? Are they turning out to be lazy inconsiderate people? And most of all... Do you care enough to admit she might be right and then do something about it to help your kids? Or will you just blame your sisters honesty and take out your internal anger at the truth, on her? \n\nWho are you really mad at... her being honest or that fact that she is right and that your kids behaviors are your own fault?

Being fat as a kid just flat out isn\u2019t as big of a concern as it is for older people . it\u2019s just extremely easy to lose weight as a kid/teen with or without a growth spurt .

You do not want to hear it because the truth hurts, but your staying ignorant isn't helping your kids; in fact, it's only damaging their health more and more. \n\nLet's be blunt: your kids have a weight problem, do not want to do chores, and were outright disrespectful. They were literally too busy eating to lay the table so that they could have dinner. Your sister told you the hard facts, and you said, \"But you should have been nicer about it.\"\n\nYou, as a family, need to see a dietitian. You need to start going for walks and doing activities as a family to get you all active. You need to set boundaries, like no chores means no allowance or similar. You are setting your kids up for a lifetime of issues, both with their eating habits but also with their refusal to do chores. Do you want to be the parent of the kids in university that no one wants to dorm with because they are too lazy to do dishes or clean? \n\nYou need to stop pussyfooting around (and expecting others to do so) and step up to the parenting plate. Nothing is going to change if you are too busy worrying about how others address the issues to actually do something to remedy them.

They've demolished my spare room. \n\nYou: How dare you be so accusatory! Can't you put that nicely? Why tell me about the holes they've knocked in the walls? What does that achieve?\n\nIt's absurd.

Your kids need and deserve for you to do better.", "It made you take it seriously enough to post it here & get a good dose of reality. \n\nWould you have posted here if she had been more gentle?\n\nI\u2019d say she has just done you a massive favour. \n\nYou now realise you haven\u2019t been \u201cparenting\u201d your children & you have an opportunity to start. \n\nUp to you if you take it - but you should be grateful to your sister right now.", "She didn't say it to the kids, so why does this bother you so much?

Cool. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s just lazy parenting because they don\u2019t learn that there is consequences for their actions. Your kids are being set up to fail in their futures because of it.

My daughter is about 5'9.5, upper 230s", "I agree, I used hugely pissed to hear that while their aunt was asking them to set the table, they were parked on the couch snacking away.

Your son is obese and your daughter is pushing 240 pounds.", "They\u2019re obese. Going in the morbidly side soon if you don\u2019t get a handle on it.  You know it.", "I say this in all seriousness and with no malicious intent: how long is the biggest gap between them eating? Because it looks like they're going from snacks to meals constantly, with no gaps. \n\nYou asked how you address your daughter's high blood pressure and the doctor's concerns. You be honest. The conversation should go like this:\n\n\"Look, guys, we've fallen into a lot of unhealthy habits. We spoken to the doctor and he/she has some concerns about blood pressure and weight gain, so from now on we are all going to do better so that we can ALL be the best, healthiest versions of ourselves. \n\n\"We are going to speak to a dietitian and get some help on how we can all eat healthily so we aren't snacking all the time and eating food that isn't good for us. Yes, there will be treats, but they will be treats. We're also going to start doing things as a family so we can be more active and spend time together. \n\n\"You guys are also going to do better with doing your chores. Soon enough, you'll be living on your own, and unless you plan on living in a pig sty, you need to get used to doing things around the house, and doing it without having to be asked to do it once, let alone two, three or more times. You guys need to do better because no one is going to do these things for you.\"\n\nYou make it a thing as a family so no one feels singled out, and you stick to it. You find a healthy balance for food, even if that means signing up for food deliveries to deliver you healthy ingredients and food if you can afford to do so. And you don't fold. Your daughter should not have high blood pressure at 17. If she continues, she will be looking at a heart attack before 40. The fact that she doesn't currently need medication is why you need to do this now, so you can catch it before it becomes an even bigger, more permanent problem.", "pounds yes", "understood"]}
