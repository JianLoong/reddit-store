With regards to figuring out the weight issue, start slowly and try to make it a fun together thing, start walking everyday, my partner and I walk every day after dinner, it helps digestion, my partner has had a lot less heart burn since we started and it gives us time to talk with no distractions (like TV or phones). Maybe find activities you all like, swimming once a week may be fun, especially if you live near a beach swimming in the ocean is great exercise due to the current or surfing may be something different for them, or if you live near any trails/paths try cycling together, make a day of it go somewhere nice and explore. If there are any sports you enjoy watching, maybe try them even if it's just kicking a ball about or hitting it. If you all start to enjoy walking, you could try hiking like mountains. I used to have relatives in Scotland and we loved hiking the mountains, we'd take a picnic and once we got to the top of the mountain, we'd stop and have the picnic, then go back down, it was a full day thing and we all loved it. If you find something enjoyable it's not boring healthy exercise anymore, it's a fun activity. Depending on what your diet is like, slowly cut down on things, if you have a lot of takeaway try starting by limiting it to once a week. As your sister mentioned snacking, try to keep less unhealthy snacks like crisps and chocolate (only buy enough for 1 of each per person per day) but have lots of healthy snacks in the house, fruit, crudete and low fat dips, low calorie crackerbreads with low fat soft cheese. It's more effort but healthier and tastes better. That way if they run out of unhealthy snacks before you go shopping their only option is the healthy snacks and you can eat 4 oranges for less calories than a snickers so less calorie dense food means they can eat a fair amount but less calories and more nutrients, so they won't go hungry and they may feel better, like energy levels, good skin and hair. Try to get them involved with cooking healthy family meals, so they can help around the house and learn the skills and nutrient knowledge themselves, so when they do leave home eventually they will be able to keep up the healthy lifestyle themselves. I hope this advice helps. I don't mean any offense by these suggestions. I'm not trying to imply you eat nothing but takeaway and never get of the settee, I'm just trying to give advice without fully knowing your diet and exercise situation.
