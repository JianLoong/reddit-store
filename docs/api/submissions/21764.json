With regards to figuring out the weight issue, start slowly and try to make it a fun together thing, start walking everyday, my partner and I walk every day after dinner, it helps digestion, my partner has had a lot less heart burn since we started and it gives us time to talk with no distractions (like TV or phones). Maybe find activities you all like, swimming once a week may be fun, especially if you live near a beach swimming in the ocean is great exercise due to the current or surfing may be something different for them, or if you live near any trails/paths try cycling together, make a day of it go somewhere nice and explore. If there are any sports you enjoy watching, maybe try them even if it's just kicking a ball about or hitting it. If you all start to enjoy walking, you could try hiking like mountains. I used to have relatives in Scotland and we loved hiking the mountains, we'd take a picnic and once we got to the top of the mountain, we'd stop and have the picnic, then go back down, it was a full day thing and we all loved it. If you find something enjoyable it's not boring healthy exercise anymore, it's a fun activity. Depending on what your diet is like, slowly cut down on things, if you have a lot of takeaway try starting by limiting it to once a week. As your sister mentioned snacking, try to keep less unhealthy snacks like crisps and chocolate (only buy enough for 1 of each per person per day) but have lots of healthy snacks in the house, fruit, crudete and low fat dips, low calorie crackerbreads with low fat soft cheese. It's more effort but healthier and tastes better. That way if they run out of unhealthy snacks before you go shopping their only option is the healthy snacks and you can eat 4 oranges for less calories than a snickers so less calorie dense food means they can eat a fair amount but less calories and more nutrients, so they won't go hungry and they may feel better, like energy levels, good skin and hair. Try to get them involved with cooking healthy family meals, so they can help around the house and learn the skills and nutrient knowledge themselves, so when they do leave home eventually they will be able to keep up the healthy lifestyle themselves. I hope this advice helps. I don't mean any offense by these suggestions. I'm not trying to imply you eat nothing but takeaway and never get of the settee, I'm just trying to give advice without fully knowing your diet and exercise situation.

They have no reason to behave any differently for her than they do with you...because you won't do anything to them.  You 'instinctively' knew there would be consequences.   Your kids don't have consequences.", "Because they are in charge of this house...and you...and they know it.", "Ya, you\u2019re lucky to have someone to try to help!", "she ended up with a bellyache that night", "never said it made it ok", "And that means nothing. Interesting response, though.  Says it all.", "And you never said it wasn't okay.  You're just passively letting her do whatever she wants, whenever she wants.", "I mean, you definitely don\u2019t want your children to be scared of you but you should still have consequences for bad behaviour.

It\u2019s not like she is coming from a home with well-established healthy routines and she\u2019s rebellious. The only people to blame for the fact that they have raised a spoiled, lazy, obese young woman is the parents who created the inconsistent home life where anything goes. I don\u2019t doubt her dad loves her and he clearly didn\u2019t intend for it to be like this. It\u2019s really easy to just set into a pattern of behavior that they can\u2019t even recognize how dysfunctional their home is. It\u2019s like a frog boiling in a pot. If it slowly became this way over time, they only realize it when it\u2019s too late. Thank goodness for a straight talking auntie. \n\nSo in my opinion, this is something that they need to sit down and talk over together as a family, and the adults in the house need to have real talk with their nearly grown children, and discuss how they are going to collectively do a better job together, ideally under the guidance of a family therapist who can teach them the skills to turn this ship around and provide the outside motivation to maintain their course when it gets tough.", "she's not some princess that we bend to.

I lift weights and I'm in my 30s and hate how fat I am (WITH STRETCH MARKS!) and I'm taller and weigh less than your daughter. Gross. You needed the wake-up call.\n\nAre you and your wife also obese and totally fine with it? Because I can't see this getting to this point by any other stance.

It's fucking pink.\" \n\nIf she wanted to bring up their health (which is fine), she could definitely show some tact, like\" Jon and Peyton need to change their eating habits and exercise to live a long and healthy life\", not \"Your kids are fat and lazy\".

Buy a bunch of those snack packs with cheese and almonds and crackers just start replacing snacks with healthy snack substitutes. Start small like caramel popcorn instead of Doritos.

Not saying you have to make them do everything but there should be expectations. Do they get out of the house and in the outdoors? \nI have a teen right about that age. When I come home most of the time the house is picked up. She does her own laundry, cooks complete meals, washes dishes, feeds the dog etc.. I only have to ask her once. I say hey going to work do you mind doing the dishes and cleaning your bathroom. It\u2019s about telling them they have to do it. But I just ask now and she knows.
