My dad died when I was 3 and I was 5 when my mom married my stepdad and I became a brother to my stepdad's three kids who were 6, 4 and 1 at the time. My mom and stepdad also had my two younger siblings together a while later. My dad's family stayed in my life. Though they had to go to court because mom and them had conflict and she stopped contact with me. They were given grandparents visitation rights, including some time at Christmas, one overnight a month and the chance to take me on vacation during summer (or a two week period with them during the summer). I never did get a vacation with them before. But now they are offering me one because that whole side of the family is getting together for one.\n\nMy dad's family never included any of my siblings. I understand why. But my parents and siblings never liked it and it's caused some fights in our house, and they all hate my dad's family for that reason. My siblings told me before that my grandparents are jerks and they should have included them in their family and they asked how I could love people who reject my siblings and most of my family. My sister (the oldest) told me we were always going to be separated by them and it wasn't fair.\n\nNow that the vacation has been offered, all hell broke loose. I told my parents and they were not happy. Mom already knew about it though. When my siblings found out they immediately asked if I would go and how could I consider going when they're not being invited too and it can't be a family vacation if it doesn't include my whole family. My mom told me the right thing to do would be to reject the invite unless my grandparents are willing to let my siblings come (paid for by her and my stepdad). My stepdad told me I need to see how much it hurts my siblings to see me accept them being rejected year after year when they were innocent kids who would have loved my family as much as I do if they had been welcomed.\n\nI told my grandparents what was going on. They told me not to feel pressured either way, and they understand. But I do want to go. I just feel bad and know if I go, then I might end up being hated by my family.\n\nWIBTA if I go?", "created_utc": 1672257216, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxj4uy/wibta_if_i_go_on_vacation_with_my_grandparents/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To me, it\u2019s emotional abuse (by your mom/stepdad) to use your stepsibs to manipulate your in this way. It\u2019s not right nor fair.  If I were you, I\u2019d only explain one time that you are going and for them to never try forcing you to choose between them (grandparents) nor try making it about themselves.  Your grandparents are that, yours. Have fun on that trip.\nAlso, don\u2019t worry about being hated. Whatever feelings they have they\u2019ll get over it.  What happens if you go to college and they pay for it? Will your mom/stepsibs try to guilt you for having ppl who love you?  Instead of thinking your fam would possibly hate you, think of it in a different way.  Think what would happen if you stand up and be clear on how you feel and how you won\u2019t fall for the emotional guilt trips they try on you.  It\u2019s their way of forcing you to limit your time and alienate yourself from family and that is not healthy.  It\u2019s abuse so don\u2019t allow that type negative energy in your space.  Stand up for yourself and your feelings are valid.  Believe that and move with clarity. Don\u2019t second guess loving your grandparents and wanting to be near them.", "NTA.
