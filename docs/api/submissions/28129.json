Nick has a girlfriend, I\u2019ll call her \u201cJosie\u201d (24) and they\u2019ve been dating 8/9 months. Nick introduced Josie to the group about 6 months ago.\n\nBoth Josie and I are mixed race, the rest of the group is white. Ever since we met Josie, she\u2019s made really out of pocket comments to/about me concerning racially related things. Things like asking me if/why all my friends are white, questions about my mother\u2019s (African) background, comments about how I do my hair, like how I shouldn\u2019t straighten it. I always try to steer the conversation away from these topics and laugh it all off but she brings it up so often. Nick says she\u2019s just trying to find a foothold in the friend group but I don\u2019t see why she can\u2019t try to get to know me (or anyone in the group) as people rather than just bringing up this irrelevant thing we have in common. I also pointed out to Nick that Josie and I may both be half African but not the same country in africa, it\u2019s wildly different cultures, even if I was raised in an african culture which I wasn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t be one similar to hers so really it\u2019s grasping at straws. And that\u2019s to say nothing of the fact that it makes me uncomfortable.\n\nAnyway, over the weekend we all had a boat day and we were having lunch. We were talking about school and I mentioned that one of the schools I went to had predominantly Asian students. Josie asked if there were any black students in my year and I said yes, but I didn\u2019t know them very well. She then asked if the reason I wasn\u2019t friends with them is because they thought I wasn\u2019t \u201cblack enough\u201d. I don\u2019t know if it was that comment or the countless ones before it but I just felt so angry that she would once again take a conversation that everyone was participating in and make it into a race thing for no reason. I said, \u201cno Josie that\u2019s not why we weren\u2019t friends. Frankly the only person I\u2019ve ever met who is obsessed with my racial identity is you. And just so you know, it\u2019s really creepy.\u201d Josie tried to stutter an apology but I said the only apology I was interested in was it not being brought up again, and my bf jumped in and changed the topic. \n\nNick later took me aside and said I\u2019d really upset Josie and she was just trying to bond with me. He said she has trauma (he didn\u2019t got into detail) about her race and by humiliating her I\u2019d made her really uncomfortable. I told him that that wasn\u2019t my problem and I\u2019m not going to be Josie emotional support \u201ccoloured\u201d friend, and if he thought I should be then I wasn\u2019t sure what that said about how he views me.\n\nNick is now mad at me for insinuating he\u2019s racist and two friends have taken his side. I don\u2019t think I was wrong for wanting Josie to respect me like everyone else but evidently people think what I said was harsh.

Josie was the one crossing the line, Nick should have addressed that instead of trying to blame you for the situation. \n\nI think the real issue here is Josie is very insecure and she projected that on you in the only way she knew how. We all have some trauma in our lives, but that doesn't excuse inappropriate behavior. I don't think it has to be the end of any relationships. Maybe you and Josie could have a more private conversation about it and get to know each other as people.", "YTA\n\nYes I think it was harsh. Of course you have the right to set boundaries but you could've pulled her aside, not done it in front of the whole group. Her behaviour smacks of insecurity and I think she may also admire you. Obviously she has some issues around her race and is projecting these onto you somewhat, but it sounds like it is being done with the best intentions. She sees you so comfortable as part of this friendship group and seems to be trying to work out how to emulate you.\n\nYet in your response, instead of helping her to fit into the group you embarrassed her in front of everyone. You are the stronger person here and you should try to have a bit more patience with her.", "Nta, Nick only cares about his Gfs feelings as not yours. He doesn\u2019t sound like a good friend honestly", "NTA and I hope you take note of how your white friends are behaving", "NTA, we are not required to make other people feel comfortable about race. If we\u2019re mixed, we\u2019re not required to answer endless amounts of questions to make somebody happy.", "NTA, Josie had been making your uncomfortable since she met you, amazing that they only see it when you do it. If Josie wants to bond so much, choose book, movies or music.", "NTA You are tired of hearing about your race. You finally out your foot down about it. Josie can get over it-or not. But maybe either way, let\u2019s hope you aren\u2019t pestered by Josie about it anymore.", "NTA. I don't see what else you could have done. Josie badgers you about your race, you call her out, and low and behold, some of your friends' unexamined white racism rears its head and they decide that you just needed to take care of the feelings of the only other mixed race person in the group, and that you shouldn't rock the boat by pointing out how weird it all is. It's a mess, but it's not of your making.", "NTA\n\nJust because Nick likes having relations with someone of mixed race, who is obsessed with her own racial makeup and experience, and you happen to be of similar (but nowhere near the same) makeup, does not make her socialization into the friend group your problem.  She's his girlfriend and it is his and her responsibility to acclimate to the group or to find a new social situation where they are more comfortable.  If he doesn't like the consequences of his trying to foist his obligation to her on you, he can take it up with his reflection.  Enough is enough.\n\n\"Guys, I've expressed how I feel about my race becoming a focus of discussion many times before the incident.  I was ignored.  I have every right to ask that behaviors that make me uncomfortable be stopped, regardless of how 'traumatized' the person responsible is supposed to be.\n\nSince my multiple polite requests have been ignored, I am well within my rights to stop being polite and start being blunt.   Nick and his girlfriend need to deal with her issues and stop trying to make them mine.  I think you all need to take a breath and really think about why any of you are even entertaining the thought that her issues with being mixed are supposed to be my problem to solve.\"", "NTA - You said how you felt, if bringing up race is uncomfortable for you then she needs to respect that man. Yes in a perfect world you could have said it with just the two of you, but things don\u2019t just happen like that. You never called Nick racist , he\u2019s trying to find a way to make you look bad. He cares about you making Josie uncomfortable but not Josie making you uncomfortable to the point you snapped? Man\u2019s blinded by love tbh.", "I would go with NTA \nYou made it clear before her questions were making you uncomfortable. And indeed it\u2019s not your job, but her boyfriend, to give her the extra attention where needed.", "NTA at all.   \n\n\nYou're a person with a whole ass personality of your own, some people will strip you of that and look at you through one specific lens (sexual preference, gender identity, race, etc.). She read your social cues poorly before, all you did was make them clearer.", "NTA\n\nMy guess is she is projecting her insecurities towards you, as a result of whatever trauma she has. It does not excuse her though. Making comments about your race at every opportunity was not appropriate and it sounds like you made it clear you weren\u2019t comfortable with it.", "She keeps subtly implying your white washed, I would be beyond annoyed. NTA", "NTA it sounds like Josie is projecting her insecurities onto you. It sounds like she's trying to \"save\" you for her perceived internalized racism. You were 100% right in calling her out.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like Josie is projecting her insecurities onto you. Constantly bringing race into the discussion is unnecessary and inappropriate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
