Josie was the one crossing the line, Nick should have addressed that instead of trying to blame you for the situation. \n\nI think the real issue here is Josie is very insecure and she projected that on you in the only way she knew how. We all have some trauma in our lives, but that doesn't excuse inappropriate behavior. I don't think it has to be the end of any relationships. Maybe you and Josie could have a more private conversation about it and get to know each other as people.", "YTA\n\nYes I think it was harsh. Of course you have the right to set boundaries but you could've pulled her aside, not done it in front of the whole group. Her behaviour smacks of insecurity and I think she may also admire you. Obviously she has some issues around her race and is projecting these onto you somewhat, but it sounds like it is being done with the best intentions. She sees you so comfortable as part of this friendship group and seems to be trying to work out how to emulate you.\n\nYet in your response, instead of helping her to fit into the group you embarrassed her in front of everyone. You are the stronger person here and you should try to have a bit more patience with her.", "Nta, Nick only cares about his Gfs feelings and not yours. He doesn\u2019t sound like a good friend honestly", "NTA and I hope you take note of how your white friends are behaving", "NTA, we are not required to make other people feel comfortable about race. If we\u2019re mixed, we\u2019re not required to answer endless amounts of questions to make somebody happy.", "NTA, Josie had been making your uncomfortable since she met you, amazing that they only see it when you do it. If Josie wants to bond so much, choose book, movies or music.", "NTA You are tired of hearing about your race. You finally out your foot down about it. Josie can get over it-or not. But maybe either way, let\u2019s hope you aren\u2019t pestered by Josie about it anymore.", "NTA. I don't see what else you could have done. Josie badgers you about your race, you call her out, and low and behold, some of your friends' unexamined white racism rears its head and they decide that you just needed to take care of the feelings of the only other mixed race person in the group, and that you shouldn't rock the boat by pointing out how weird it all is. It's a mess, but it's not of your making.", "NTA\n\nJust because Nick likes having relations with someone of mixed race, who is obsessed with her own racial makeup and experience, and you happen to be of similar (but nowhere near the same) makeup, does not make her socialization into the friend group your problem.  She's his girlfriend and it is his and her responsibility to acclimate to the group or to find a new social situation where they are more comfortable.  If he doesn't like the consequences of his trying to foist his obligation to her on you, he can take it up with his reflection.  Enough is enough.\n\n\"Guys, I've expressed how I feel about my race becoming a focus of discussion many times before the incident.  I was ignored.  I have every right to ask that behaviors that make me uncomfortable be stopped, regardless of how 'traumatized' the person responsible is supposed to be.\n\nSince my multiple polite requests have been ignored, I am well within my rights to stop being polite and start being blunt.   Nick and his girlfriend need to deal with her issues and stop trying to make them mine.  I think you all need to take a breath and really think about why any of you are even entertaining the thought that her issues with being mixed are supposed to be my problem to solve.\"", "NTA - You said how you felt, if bringing up race is uncomfortable for you then she needs to respect that man. Yes in a perfect world you could have said it with just the two of you, but things don\u2019t just happen like that. You never called Nick racist , he\u2019s trying to find a way to make you look bad. He cares about you making Josie uncomfortable but not Josie making you uncomfortable to the point you snapped?

She read your social cues poorly before, all you did was make them clearer.", "NTA\n\nMy guess is she is projecting her insecurities towards you, as a result of whatever trauma she has.

While none of the comments in isolation probably merit calling a person out, the consistent pattern needs to be confronted. Sadly, other people rarely get why that kind of behavior can be so off-putting, as they mostly look at each statement by itself.\n\nI'm also mixed race, though I look very much like my father, who is from India. I didn't get many of my mother's Germanic features.  For a long time, I was the only brown person full time at my place of work (though we did have many grad students and the like who came and went). One woman would bring up my heritage at lest 3 times/week. \"Of course you like spicy food, being from India.\" That sort of thing. She would constantly forget that I was born and raised in the US, and I was ethnically half-German. Eventually I confronted her, asking why she only spoke about my ethnicity, and never anyone else's? \"Because they are from here.\" I reminded her I was from here as well. \"Because your culture is so different from ours, and I'm just interested.\" But this is my culture too.  \n\nIt became clear that this person just didn't see me as a person in the same way she saw all our white collogues.

The better thing to do, as an adult especially, would have been to wait for a moment to speak directly to Josie about it.  Since she is new to the group and probably already feeling out of place, calling her out in the group was likely especially painful.   I think 1 on 1 you would have had a better chance to see why she feels the need to keep mentioning things about it.  It would have given her an opportunity to apologize as well.   It seems like it could have been ignorant but not necessarily malicious.  I'm sure your reaction was out of frustration, but I don't think it led to the best possible result.", "ESH. It honestly sounds like she was trying to bond. Lots of mixed race people in a majority white space would look to connect like this, but she obviously assumed a lot about you guys having shared experiences which you just don't. \n\nSounds like she was going about this the wrong way, and you responded by laughing it off until you just turned mean (probably making her feel even more isolated than she already was).", "Info: did you ever set boundaries with her (or even with Nick) privately before you set them publicly?", "YTA (and, speaking from the perspective of someone who is mixed race, has definitely explored being mixed race and have been an active part of the larger community before realizing it's not actually something I feel defines me at present). I don't think these questions from Josie were unfriendly, and are things I'd ask someone I had a superficial connection with to get to know more about them. I don't see the part where you communicated with Josie that these questions made you uncomfortable; only one part where you literally laugh it off OR where you said \"I also pointed out to Nick [...]\", which makes me think that from Josie's perspective, you've been lightly receptive or neutral to these questions and critical to others, and then suddenly blew up and called her creepy and that you definitively weren't friends. I can also hear some anger about having emphasis placed on this part of your identity that you don't personally find to be as important to you as it is to her.  \nI think you have complex and justified feelings, are allowed to not want to be defined by whatever you want, but did not communicate that well enough. Blowing up on someone because they tried to connect with you in a healthy, normal way that you did not clearly put a warning sign on from the beginning seems a little unfair. It's hard for certain folks to fully understand what being mixed means to them. Even the question about being \"[race] enough\" sounds so similar to struggles I've heard from literally around the world. It's not a creepy thing to want genuine human connection and validation, and it's also okay for you to not want to give it, as long as you're not a dick about it or putting others down.", "ESH.\n\nJosie should have been able to notice that talking about race issues made you uncomfortable, but you should also have talked to her about it in private like a mature adult before calling her out publicly out of seemingly nowhere in front of all your friends.

The fact you are all 24-26 is concerning.", "YTA you should of pulled her aside from the start and told her you didn\u2019t like talking abt it. she was clearly trying to relate to you in things she faced also being mixed. Most POC take a lot of pride in their race and talk abt it with other people like them so for you to call her out and make her feel bad abt it in a group was messed up and all these non black people in the comments telling you your not wrong have never been through it so they don\u2019t know you should of just sat her down to see where she was coming from cause those conversations are normal for POC.", "YTA tbh.\nlike idk im fully black so I may be completely wrong here, but I get how she may have felt seen by you and wanted to talk to YOU about YOUR experiences. not just about your African side but your entire identity as a mixed person wherever you live. did she go about it totally wrong? absolutely. but snapping on her in front of her in front of all of YOUR friends without ever directly saying \"please stop talking about this\" beforehand is kind of a dick move. like yeah obviously ideally she would have seen your attempts to divert in previous conversations and stopped bringing it up entirely, but if she didn't it is on YOU to make sure she knows exactly how you feel. she isnt a mind reader and if she wants to be close to you bad enough she probably got tunnel vision. I'm not saying this to say you're a bad person and should accept her uncomfortable topics just because shes not being malicious, I hate almost all conversations about race and will shut down when people start talking about it.

He may have just been reactive because he saw his gf hurt while she was trying to fit in with his friends or he may actually believe that it's your job to be her emotional support friend because you're both biracial. If he was just being reactive then you should be able to move past it.

Use some of her phrases so she knows you're listening and say something about how you've never been in that situation, you have had more positive experiences than negative ones, etc and perhaps just placating her with that topic she yearns to discuss will pass.", "NTA, this is when you claim she traumatized you with all her racial questions.

She isn't an asshole for having anxieties and she's clearly trying to find some common ground in a situation she is new to but is doing it in an inappropriate way. Maybe you should have a conversation about it and explain why you said what you did?

If someone of another race says something critical to you about how you are handling race issues, think about it for at least a day before making it all about your offense. We all have unconscious biases. If a POC says you\u2019re handling something poorly, they\u2019re not calling you Hitler. They just want you to think through your actions a little more.

No. Am I trying to do better? Definitely.", "You don't think there's a difference between called out in front of a group vs. called out privately?", "Exactly!

I agree with your reasons though.", "Was thinking the same thing - I don't blame OP for feeling how she did, but I think she should have taken Josie aside earlier and been frank about not wanting to discuss these things instead of waiting and chewing her out.", "I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s been your experience. \n\nTbh my whole family is from/has adopted different cultures. As an adult I would say my cultural references are mainly British but as a kid they were mainly Mediterranean.

I also went to an international school when I was young where most of the kids were East Asian, then to a high school that was predominantly south Asian, then to another international school with an equal mix of cultures and the school basically had its own culture. I\u2019ve always felt very much just myself rather than a nationality and my parents are like that too, we all hold multiple citizenships.

You have an entire ass personality of your own. Nta though.", "Thank you. Her comments in the post read like she has racial identity issues herself and these two are more like opposite sides of the same spectrum.

(Fingers crossed that made you laugh)\n\nI want to say when I'm friends with someone, I like it when they are comfortable enough in my presence to be themselves and share their lived experiences. Personally I don't usually add too much and just listen and refill drinks.

The whole time j was reading this it reminded me so much of when I was in an all white friend group, and when I faced racism they couldn't help me in any way because they didn't relate.

No. We already are aware we are black. Talk about normal everyday stuff, no one wants to talk about their race almost every conversation. That\u2019s a very miserable life.

I think being told I shouldn't be around minority, black people, or their nieces and nephews because I am comfortable talking about race is kind of grounds for feeling like someone is being aggressive to my perspective. I apologize for calling you angry or your family kin. I don't know what it's like to live in Africa, just that I again had a lot of immigration and refugees in my American community and I learned to navigate our individual identities that way. I was also pointing out that OP and Josie were both mixed and OP was balking at the idea of relating to another mixed person because it was on the topic of race.

One dimensional takes.", "No, I think she's just seeking to understand if the commenting is speaking from personal experience or not.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s racist to say that Black people are more likely to have greater insight into Black experiences, which is what we\u2019re talking about here.\n\nObviously that doesn\u2019t mean that all Black people will agree (as we\u2019ve seen in the comment section), or that the Black person in a conversation is automatically right (see Clarence Thomas), but for example I think we all innately understand how inappropriate it is when a white person tries to lecture a Black person about racism.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here, I just bring it up as support for the fact that the races of different speakers do matter when we\u2019re discussing racism and racial experiences", "She\u2019s not an asshole for wanting to connect with OP and that \u201cblack enough\u201d comment was not malicious. Oh really? Why do I not find her an asshole? Please explain since you know. Is it because I understand where she is coming from as a black person? All you\u2019re doing is proving my point. The black people get it\u2026"]}
