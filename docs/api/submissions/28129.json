Josie was the one crossing the line, Nick should have addressed that instead of trying to blame you for the situation. \n\nI think the real issue here is Josie is very insecure and she projected that on you in the only way she knew how. We all have some trauma in our lives, but that doesn't excuse inappropriate behavior. I don't think it has to be the end of any relationships. Maybe you and Josie could have a more private conversation about it and get to know each other as people.", "YTA\n\nYes I think it was harsh. Of course you have the right to set boundaries but you could've pulled her aside, not done it in front of the whole group. Her behaviour smacks of insecurity and I think she may also admire you. Obviously she has some issues around her race and is projecting these onto you somewhat, but it sounds like it is being done with the best intentions. She sees you so comfortable as part of this friendship group and seems to be trying to work out how to emulate you.\n\nYet in your response, instead of helping her to fit into the group you embarrassed her in front of everyone. You are the stronger person here and you should try to have a bit more patience with her.", "Nta, Nick only cares about his Gfs feelings and not yours. He doesn\u2019t sound like a good friend honestly", "NTA and I hope you take note of how your white friends are behaving", "NTA, we are not required to make other people feel comfortable about race. If we\u2019re mixed, we\u2019re not required to answer endless amounts of questions to make somebody happy.", "NTA, Josie had been making your uncomfortable since she met you, amazing that they only see it when you do it. If Josie wants to bond so much, choose book, movies or music.", "NTA You are tired of hearing about your race. You finally out your foot down about it. Josie can get over it-or not. But maybe either way, let\u2019s hope you aren\u2019t pestered by Josie about it anymore.", "NTA. I don't see what else you could have done. Josie badgers you about your race, you call her out, and low and behold, some of your friends' unexamined white racism rears its head and they decide that you just needed to take care of the feelings of the only other mixed race person in the group, and that you shouldn't rock the boat by pointing out how weird it all is. It's a mess, but it's not of your making.", "NTA\n\nJust because Nick likes having relations with someone of mixed race, who is obsessed with her own racial makeup and experience, and you happen to be of similar (but nowhere near the same) makeup, does not make her socialization into the friend group your problem.  She's his girlfriend and it is his and her responsibility to acclimate to the group or to find a new social situation where they are more comfortable.  If he doesn't like the consequences of his trying to foist his obligation to her on you, he can take it up with his reflection.  Enough is enough.\n\n\"Guys, I've expressed how I feel about my race becoming a focus of discussion many times before the incident.  I was ignored.  I have every right to ask that behaviors that make me uncomfortable be stopped, regardless of how 'traumatized' the person responsible is supposed to be.\n\nSince my multiple polite requests have been ignored, I am well within my rights to stop being polite and start being blunt.   Nick and his girlfriend need to deal with her issues and stop trying to make them mine.  I think you all need to take a breath and really think about why any of you are even entertaining the thought that her issues with being mixed are supposed to be my problem to solve.\"", "NTA - You said how you felt, if bringing up race is uncomfortable for you then she needs to respect that man. Yes in a perfect world you could have said it with just the two of you, but things don\u2019t just happen like that. You never called Nick racist , he\u2019s trying to find a way to make you look bad. He cares about you making Josie uncomfortable but not Josie making you uncomfortable to the point you snapped?

She read your social cues poorly before, all you did was make them clearer.", "NTA\n\nMy guess is she is projecting her insecurities towards you, as a result of whatever trauma she has.

While none of the comments in isolation probably merit calling a person out, the consistent pattern needs to be confronted. Sadly, other people rarely get why that kind of behavior can be so off-putting, as they mostly look at each statement by itself.\n\nI'm also mixed race, though I look very much like my father, who is from India. I didn't get many of my mother's Germanic features.  For a long time, I was the only brown person full time at my place of work (though we did have many grad students and the like who came and went). One woman would bring up my heritage at lest 3 times/week. \"Of course you like spicy food, being from India.\" That sort of thing. She would constantly forget that I was born and raised in the US, and I was ethnically half-German. Eventually I confronted her, asking why she only spoke about my ethnicity, and never anyone else's? \"Because they are from here.\" I reminded her I was from here as well. \"Because your culture is so different from ours, and I'm just interested.\" But this is my culture too.  \n\nIt became clear that this person just didn't see me as a person in the same way she saw all our white collogues.

The better thing to do, as an adult especially, would have been to wait for a moment to speak directly to Josie about it.  Since she is new to the group and probably already feeling out of place, calling her out in the group was likely especially painful.   I think 1 on 1 you would have had a better chance to see why she feels the need to keep mentioning things about it.  It would have given her an opportunity to apologize as well.   It seems like it could have been ignorant but not necessarily malicious.  I'm sure your reaction was out of frustration, but I don't think it led to the best possible result.", "ESH. It honestly sounds like she was trying to bond. Lots of mixed race people in a majority white space would look to connect like this, but she obviously assumed a lot about you guys having shared experiences which you just don't. \n\nSounds like she was going about this the wrong way, and you responded by laughing it off until you just turned mean (probably making her feel even more isolated than she already was).", "Info: did you ever set boundaries with her (or even with Nick) privately before you set them publicly?", "YTA (and, speaking from the perspective of someone who is mixed race, has definitely explored being mixed race and have been an active part of the larger community before realizing it's not actually something I feel defines me at present). I don't think these questions from Josie were unfriendly, and are things I'd ask someone I had a superficial connection with to get to know more about them. I don't see the part where you communicated with Josie that these questions made you uncomfortable; only one part where you literally laugh it off OR where you said \"I also pointed out to Nick [...]\", which makes me think that from Josie's perspective, you've been lightly receptive or neutral to these questions and critical to others, and then suddenly blew up and called her creepy and that you definitively weren't friends. I can also hear some anger about having emphasis placed on this part of your identity that you don't personally find to be as important to you as it is to her.  \nI think you have complex and justified feelings, are allowed to not want to be defined by whatever you want, but did not communicate that well enough. Blowing up on someone because they tried to connect with you in a healthy, normal way that you did not clearly put a warning sign on from the beginning seems a little unfair. It's hard for certain folks to fully understand what being mixed means to them. Even the question about being \"[race] enough\" sounds so similar to struggles I've heard from literally around the world. It's not a creepy thing to want genuine human connection and validation, and it's also okay for you to not want to give it, as long as you're not a dick about it or putting others down.", "ESH.\n\nJosie should have been able to notice that talking about race issues made you uncomfortable, but you should also have talked to her about it in private like a mature adult before calling her out publicly out of seemingly nowhere in front of all your friends.

The fact you are all 24-26 is concerning.", "YTA you should of pulled her aside from the start and told her you didn\u2019t like talking abt it. she was clearly trying to relate to you in things she faced also being mixed. Most POC take a lot of pride in their race and talk abt it with other people like them so for you to call her out and make her feel bad abt it in a group was messed up and all these non black people in the comments telling you your not wrong have never been through it so they don\u2019t know you should of just sat her down to see where she was coming from cause those conversations are normal for POC.", "YTA tbh.\nlike idk im fully black so I may be completely wrong here, but I get how she may have felt seen by you and wanted to talk to YOU about YOUR experiences. not just about your African side but your entire identity as a mixed person wherever you live. did she go about it totally wrong? absolutely. but snapping on her in front of her in front of all of YOUR friends without ever directly saying \"please stop talking about this\" beforehand is kind of a dick move. like yeah obviously ideally she would have seen your attempts to divert in previous conversations and stopped bringing it up entirely, but if she didn't it is on YOU to make sure she knows exactly how you feel. she isnt a mind reader and if she wants to be close to you bad enough she probably got tunnel vision. I'm not saying this to say you're a bad person and should accept her uncomfortable topics just because shes not being malicious, I hate almost all conversations about race and will shut down when people start talking about it.

OP mentions in another comment that she just expected the social cues (not engaging, not matching Josie's energy, etc.) to be enough to express her discomfort. But if Josie is new to the friend group and thus not familiar enough with OP to pick up on her hints? Or even a flavor of neurodivergent? Kinda fuck't to put her on blast  without ever actually saying, \"Hey I don't like this, please stop.\"", "NTA and I\u2019m commenting to elevate so that hopefully OP sees this and uses this script.

I\u2019ve had many biracial friends that look to me to teach them how to be Black etc. Usually I am pretty good at telling them honey you are black.

(I\u2019m white, by the way.) If someone of another race says something critical to you about how you are handling race issues, think about it for at least a day before making it all about your offense. We all have unconscious biases. If a POC says you\u2019re handling something poorly, they\u2019re not calling you Hitler. They just want you to think through your actions a little more. It\u2019s not a comfortable feeling by any means, but you ruin friendships and cheat yourself out of personal growth by refusing to engage in the process. \n\nHave I always been perfect about this? No. Am I trying to do better? Definitely.", "You don't think there's a difference between called out in front of a group vs. called out privately?", "Exactly! If someone feels humiliated, when someone says \"your comments cause me discomfort\" then it isn't the uncomfortable person who is being inappropriate. If they say \"it's a lovely sunny day\" and they feel humiliated by you saying it makes you uncomfortable, that's just you being weird...unless of course it's raining! \n\nBad behavior should be followed by humiliation. Humility is how we can learn appropriate boundaries. We all make a social faus pax here and there, and calling it out is the consequence.

She had no problem having a racial conversation about Asians, but when it was pointed back at her she was offended? Lady, YOU made it about race to begin with. \n\nShe also mentions having straight hair, going on that little rant about how pan-africanism is weird because she's not like her at all. I hate to tell you lady, as different as you think you are- you are closer to her than a white person and they will tell you that themselves. \n\nJosie didn't have to call OP out on being whitewashed, but OP has her own racial baggage and these two brought the worst parts of their identities out in each other until it boiled over. Instead of having an honest conversation about it with her or Nick, she ignored it, repressed it, and then blew up at her. ESH.\n\nEdit: Also, why is the black side the only issue? You could be equally non-related if your white parent is something like German vs Russian lol. But no, just the African side is irrelevant?

And the only way to know is by asking\u2026 it seems more like it\u2019s a quick and easy way to converse for the girl, while op views it something else. YTA. A lot of better way to bring it up then blowing up at someone.", "Also, there was very clearly the avenue of addressing this privately instead of in front of a group of friends.", "Agree with this mostly. OP could\u2019ve approached it earlier in a more friendly connotation before letting it bottle up. OP\u2019s not out of pocket for getting miffed. But for letting it bother them for so long", "I think neither of them are ah. Just both are bad at social cues and clear communication. I agree with your reasons though.", "Was thinking the same thing - I don't blame OP for feeling how she did, but I think she should have taken Josie aside earlier and been frank about not wanting to discuss these things instead of waiting and chewing her out.", "I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s been your experience. \n\nTbh my whole family is from/has adopted different cultures. As an adult I would say my cultural references are mainly British but as a kid they were mainly Mediterranean.

I also went to an international school when I was young where most of the kids were East Asian, then to a high school that was predominantly south Asian, then to another international school with an equal mix of cultures and the school basically had its own culture. I\u2019ve always felt very much just myself rather than a nationality and my parents are like that too, we all hold multiple citizenships. So it\u2019s just very natural for me. \n\nI know Josie had a very stable background in terms of living in the same place always and hasn\u2019t travelled much so I don\u2019t think my experiences would be helpful to her, they\u2019re definitely not familiar (as she has regularly told me). \n\nI said elsewhere I don\u2019t think she was being malicious in any way and maybe she was looking for a reference point but I feel like the way she went about it was becoming increasingly uncomfortable for me.", "Correct me if I am wrong, but from the post I understood that OP never made it clear to Josie that Josie's comments were uncomfortable\n\n> I always try to steer the conversation away from these topics and laugh it all off but she brings it up so often.\n\nSome people don't read hints like these. This is far from clear. \n\nAs I also understood from the post, OP raised concerns about Josie's behavior with Nick, not with Josie herself.", "This is a very funny comment. You have an entire ass personality of your own. Nta though.", "Thank you. Her comments in the post read like she has racial identity issues herself and these two are more like opposite sides of the same spectrum. She wants to pretend like they're not alike and they have nothing in common, but trust the white people that see you don't know or care. To them, you're the same.", "As a white woman in America, obviously I have to insert myself into this conversation. (Fingers crossed that made you laugh)\n\nI want to say when I'm friends with someone, I like it when they are comfortable enough in my presence to be themselves and share their lived experiences. Personally I don't usually add too much and just listen and refill drinks. But I think more white people would benefit from shutting up and learning that it's really not that uncomfortable when PoC share what life is like for them. \n\nIt's not exactly the same but I appreciate my straight/cis friends who give me space to be myself without the undercurrent of it being weird for them.", "Thank you so much for saying this! The whole time j was reading this it reminded me so much of when I was in an all white friend group, and when I faced racism they couldn't help me in any way because they didn't relate.

No. We already are aware we are black. Talk about normal everyday stuff, no one wants to talk about their race almost every conversation. That\u2019s a very miserable life.

I think being told I shouldn't be around minority, black people, or their nieces and nephews because I am comfortable talking about race is kind of grounds for feeling like someone is being aggressive to my perspective. I apologize for calling you angry or your family kin. I don't know what it's like to live in Africa, just that I again had a lot of immigration and refugees in my American community and I learned to navigate our individual identities that way. I was also pointing out that OP and Josie were both mixed and OP was balking at the idea of relating to another mixed person because it was on the topic of race.

Especially since you don\u2019t know her exact intentions with these comments. Given the limited data you\u2019ve provided, I don\u2019t think the idea that she\u2019s imposing an identity on you holds water. Her asking if you couldn\u2019t relate to other black kids at school because you weren\u2019t culturally black enough (and specifically culturally African American enough) makes it pretty clear that she was trying to bond with you over a shared experience. Especially since I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a real issue that African non-Americans face. And she didn\u2019t even assume that was your experience, she *asked* about it.

I don\u2019t let being partially black define my entire identity, and even if I did, blackness isn\u2019t a monolithic thing/experience. I am not super comfortable talking about this in front of others and making all our interactions be about race, so I would appreciate it if you didn\u2019t.\u201d To get people to understand your position and respect your boundaries, don\u2019t you have to *articulate* that position and *set* those boundaries first? \n\nThis is the problem with wokeness being an assumed shared/universal standard.

Yes, your white friends are being dumb and racist for assuming that you should be the one to talk to her about the black experience by default, but I think the statement that they wanted you to be her mixed \u201cemotional support friend\u201d could be a mischaracterization. She made an overture to try to make friends with someone in the group using what common ground she knows, and you chose to lash out in anger because she \u201cshould have known\u201d it was overstepping, without even having a conversation about it first. It\u2019s just like being in a romantic relationship: if you assume malicious intent without first *asking* the person\u2019s intent, you\u2019re gonna be fighting all the time.

OP shouldn\u2019t have to be grilled over the details of their lifestyle for someone else\u2019s benefit(honestly, maybe just someone else\u2019s entertainment). Josie has no right to that business. On the other hand, OP is in an isolating situation where their friend group doesn\u2019t understand where OP might be coming from, and this is one of those situations that turns a lot of people away from homogeneous cis-white friend groups. Because when you\u2019re the token diversity, you tend to deal with more bullshit ranging from micro-aggressions to regular ass aggressions.", "You would ask someone you barely know why their inner circle of friends are white, why they straighten their hair when they're half Black, and if the reason their closest friends aren't Black instead of white is because they're too whitewashed?

OP changing the topic and laughing instead of answering those intrusive, bait questions everytime Josie brought them up was pretty clear. She very much showed that is isn't receptive to them, yet Josie kept pushing despite never getting an answer in 9 whole months. That's not a normal thing to keep bringing up for someone who actually wants to make friends. Connecting would be asking non loaded or accusatory questions, like \"hey, I noticed you have curly hair too!

It sounds like she was trying to find common ground with you as someone dismissed by black social groups. Instead, since that does not ring strongly with you, it came off really weird.\n\nTalking about the hair and such may be something she has desired being able to speak about, but never had anyone with which she felt comfortable doing so. The trauma Nick spoke of could be some sort of exclusion from a black community. Her asking if you were excluded because you weren't \"black enough\" may make sense to her because it was normal for her. Rather than judging you, she may just assume you have had similar experiences.\n\nMaybe she is just a psycho, but I think there is a real possibility she is just desperate for a friend 'like her', and that desperation is coming across as aggression.", "Exactly thats why OP not only was polite and gave her a good reality check but its also correcting her bad behavior.

I've never asked because it doesn't matter), where they may or may not come from isn't important, beyond what parts of their culture they choose to celebrate and share - what matters is who they are and how they work. Last I checked people of any colour or combination of colours or cultures can be from anywhere, so its a piss poor way to try decide anything about anyone. The outside is just window dressing, it's what's inside that counts.

You also strike out from time to time. IDK if OP is carrying baggage or is just generally not interested in conversations about race, but that's not indicative of everyone, and there's no harm in trying to reach out. A lot of mixed black-white folks are very passionate about talking about this subject; there's certainly been a big upswing in children and YA literature normalizing mixed race experiences recently, which is a great thing.

I don't see why you had to blow up in her face for trying to bond over a possibly shared experience? That's completely normal, and you should have communicated if something made you uncomfortable.

My friend group is also majority white (because they share those same interests as me), but there is the occasional POC person who's in our friend group that just HAS to make it about race, like please stop diminishing me just to my race, I have lots of other interests that we can both talk about (which honestly, is  more of a thing we have in common than us being from the same continent, not even country, and also never being raised the same way). Anyway, I understand your frustration completely, it really annoys me when people do that. It's also awkward because it feels weirdly isolating, like imagine all your white friends just talking about how they're white the whole time. However, with all that said, I do think you should have taken her aside and told her to stop doing that instead of telling her in front of everyone. It's really hard when you are trying to join a friend group, you already feel out of place and try to fit in.
