No presents *needed* is them being polite because you asked.  I mean, come on, who doesn't take a present to a NINE YEAR OLD'S BIRTHDAY? Who even needs to ask that? OF COURSE you bring one. You asking probaly  made them think \"ok maybe OP has some financial or religious obstacle to gifts, let's let them off\"", "NTA\n\nYou were told no gift was needed and that is that.\n\nWhen parents say that to me, I usually just gift a book though.", "IDK man, when my child is invited to a party everyone says, \"What should we bring for a gift?\" the parent says, \"He likes lego, but there's no need for a present, just bring yourselves!\"... then you buy the kid some lego. It's just how it goes. NAH, but I think your wife is right (in fact I think you should have taken two gifts, one from each boy, especially when the hosts had accommodated one of them as an extra guest).\n\nEdit: I meant NAH, not N T A.", "NTA\nYou firstly asked to see if both your twins were allowed to attend BUT you also ask what gift the birthday boy likes and you were told not to worry about gifts.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for parents to not want gifts given to their kids because their kids already have too much crap and they don\u2019t need another dozen toys. You trusted and respected the parent\u2019s wishes. You absolutely did the right thing.", "NTA if you follow the instructions when putting something together from IKEA are you an asshole when it\u2019s built and it functions as intended? No, you\u2019re not.  Faced the same issue with my kids. The a holes here are the parents who did bring a present. They did not follow the instructions", "NTA, you did everything correctly, and operated within the rules you were given. Also, side note, if she new \u201csocial nicety\u201d dictated you bring a gift, and she went there sans gift\u2026..why didn\u2019t she grab one on the way as a contingency?", "NTA honestly people probably felt obligated to bring a gift however, the parents told you not to bring anything so it\u2019s fair not to. They might not have wanted a bunch of presents that the kid may or may not even like anyway.", "NTA.  You asked if presents were requested, the parents of the child said no.  It isn't reasonable to expect you to \\*know\\* something like this.  Not a bad thing to teach children that the experience is more important than the things, as well.", "NAH. They told you that you didn't *need* to bring a gift so you didn't. I would take that as the parent hinting that they didn't want people brining presents for whatever reason. If your wife and kids think it's such a big deal just go out, buy something, and explain the misunderstanding to the kid and their parents.", "If I get told no presents needed, I usually chuck money in a card. Usually the parents say no presents because they don't want more toys cluttering up the place. But nta", "NTA - they told you no. All these people talking about etiquette would blast you for doing ANYTHING else you were told not to. Kids probably have enough toys and the parents didn\u2019t want a bunch of random cheap toys to sort later", "Yta for asking is the twin invited. Just because they are twins doesn't mean they have to do everything together or have the same friends etc, that was extremely rude and inappropriate.\n\nAlso in future you don't ask the parents what the kid wants, either give money in a card or buy a toy appropriate for that age group.", "NTA this happened to me too. I had to grab a gift card from the gas station and run back to he party.", "Gentle ESH. It\u2019s pretty poor to show up to a party empty handed, especially for a 9 year old. The parent shouldn\u2019t have told you not to get a gift. Your wife also has agency and could\u2019ve gotten a gift, assuming she knew about the party ahead of time.", "Gentle YTA, or at the very least just naive. It would have been common sense to take a gift in my opinion. Your wife maybe could have picked up something quickly on the way if she was that bothered though.", "Yta but not for the present situation.\n\nI hate it that parents always ask or see the need to bring both of the twins. Just one got the invitation, so it should just that one go", "Asking if your other son was invited too was actually **your first A H move**. The parent couldn't decline while the birthday kid probably is friends with just one of them, as only one of them was invited.\n\nAlso, depending what country, where I am the kids get a little gift bag with candy and a little toy at the end of the party. The mom would have to organize one last moment for the uninvited guest. And was the party at home or at a venue (play parc or whatever). They charge per kid. So imposing your other kid is rude and entitled.\n\nAnd yes, not bringing a gift to a kids party? What planet do you live on? You have TWO nine year old's. How would they react on not getting gifts at their party?\n\nYTA. Twice", "NTA. If anyone, it's this mom.", "NTA Fuck these mind games. They told you not to. You didn't.", "Don\u2019t turn up to a kids party without a gift. Everyone knows that. And your kids are now labelled as sucky with their friends. Well done. YTA", "If your wife knew better and was taking them, why didn't she do something about it? NTA, though the comment does sound like a polite way of saying do what you want.", "NTA but a bit nieve. It's a bit like when my wife says she doesn't want anything from the shop. We both know that's code for \"surprise me\".", "ESH yes usually you still bring a gift but your wife can't blame you for that since she could have also getting a gift. so her giving you a hard time and saying \"social nicety should have dictacted that we bring a gift\" is kind of on her.", "Yta.  \n\nOf course, the parents will say no gifts are needed.  They don't want to sound like entitled ah and demand you buy their kid something.  \n\nBut it's a birthday party. For a kid.  You have to bring a gift.", "YTA it's common etiquette to take a present to a child's birthday party even if you were told none were needed.

Out of societal norms other parents probably felt obiligated to bring a gift or they may have not asked the parents and  just assumed they needed to bring a gift. Your wife and sons aren't A.H. for feeling embarrassed in the situation. You aren't A.H. either. It is just an awakward situation that they were present, but you were unable to attend. So they had to deal with feeling embarrassed while attending the party and you didn't.  Especially if others at the party were whispering about it or looking at them strange for not bring a gift. No we shouldn't care what other's think but that is a lot easier to say than do.", "NTA but I usually ake what so the kid like... one parent said gift cards.... my daughter just got another invite I just ask what  do he like and she told me...", "My general rule of thumb is of the invitation itself says something about not bringing a present, they are serious about it. If they tell you one on one, especially if prompted, I bring something. If I\u2019m told I can bring a sibling that wasn\u2019t explicitly invited, I bring a more expensive gift. All gifts are from Target or Amazon and have a gift receipt taped directly to the gift.\n\nNAH.", "YTA \nOf course you bring a present to a 9-year-old's birthday party.\n\n Actually twins bring two. Stop treating your boys as a unit. Or else you're going to have problems later on when they don't get invited to things because they've always been treated as a unit. Mom of twins with lots of experience in this pathway", "NAH I definitely see where OP is coming from and probably would\u2019ve done the same. The responses I\u2019m reading make total sense though. Use this as a learning experience for the future, but I can\u2019t call you an AH in this situation. You asked and listened.", "I\u2019m going to say a soft YTA\n\nThe other parent did say no present needed. However you\u2019re not the one who had to deal with the consequences since you were not there nor did you drop off. The other child\u2019s parents may have still held on to the the no present needed, but it is reasonably predictable even certain that everyone else would bring a gift. You didn\u2019t cause your children and spouse to break a hard rule, but they did end up committing a faux pas.\n\nSome of the burden also falls upon your spouse since they were the ones who went and should have exercised better judgment, but since you were the one who communicated with the other parent and created circumstances that now exist it fell upon you to read between the lines.", "NTA. We've done no present parties with our kids over the years for various reasons; family members already spoiled them rotten with presents before the friend's party or they decided they wanted to go more of an adventure/experience birthday that cost a little more instead of doing individual presents, especially as they got older. You did everything right, you called, you asked, the parent answered. It would have been disrespectful to have asked the kid's parent then totally ignored what they told you.", "NTA\nIf I received that message then I wouldn't have gotten anything. Some people just throw parties. I don't have time for games and to decipher your meaning. What does the kid like or want. Answer the question and move on.", "YTA and I\u2019m honestly baffled by all of these N T A replies. It\u2019s common sense to bring a gift to a kids birthday party unless *the invitation itself* explicitly says not to. \n\nWhen you reached out about what gift to bring, you put her in an awkward position. She said \u201cno gifts needed\u201d to be polite because it comes across as a bit rude to explicitly say \u201cbring a LEGO gift\u201d or whatever.", "YTA, come on, you go to nothing without bringing something, you wouldn't go to a dinner party without bringing wine or dessert.  Never show up empty handed.  That said your wife could have put money in a card when she realised too.  \n\nI can't believe you asked for an extra invite and then rocketed up empty handed, scarlet for you, that's super cheeky and though you didn't ask YTA for asking about the other twin too.", "Technically, nta. But if one son is invited and the other isn't, it was probably done on purpose.  The parent was just being polite.  If no presents are necessary, but who goes to a kid's bday party with no present?", "If we are going to be really nitpicky, I think the parent should have said \"no presents are needed, but if you want to get something they would like this or this\".", "This is spot on. Just a heads up for next time for OP.", "If they said they liked Legos, I would have absolutely got some even if they said no gifts are needed. When I asked what the child likes, the parent literally said, \"no gifts are needed. Don't worry about that.\"", "This is me.  I hosted a joint bday party for my kiddo when he turned 3. It was at a place he loved and I knew he wouldn't notice if there were no gifts.  The other mom felt the same way, plus then since the guest list didn't completely overlap people didn't need to bring presents for a kid they didn't know.\n\nAbout half the families brought gifts anyway and I wished they hadn't. Sometimes you just want to host a party and not get \"paid back\" for it. Just like every party shouldn't be a pot luck.  I just want to host you!\n\nI think it sucks that so many people here say that \"no gifts \" doesn't really mean no gifts.  Mean what you say, people!", "We are one of those \"your presence is presents enough\" families for that exact reason. Where we live it is about 50/50 for presents vs no presents at parties. So when someone says don't worry about bringing gifts we take them at their word.", "What if I buy a nerf gun and the parents don't like guns?", "Oh please If someone said no presents that\u2019s whAt it means. No one has time to play mind reader", "To be fair, she was only bothered by it after the party because everyone else had brought gifts.", "The invitation wasn't addressed specifically to one child. It just had a general date and time. If it had only one kids name on it, I wouldn't have asked.", "Not bringing a gift when you have been specifically told not to bring one is the opposite of an AH move, it's following instructions.", "Should I give them a belated gift?", "That's weird, ignoring specific instructions from parents tends to be a unanimous YTA situation on this sub. Yet apparently this guy is the TA for following those instructions.", "I would hate that, I can't for the life of me figure out why people use codes instead of words.", "It isn't entitled to ask for presents at a birthday. I honestly have no problem buying a present, I just wanted guidance. For instance I would normally buy Legos or nerf guns but if the parents doesn't like guns or if the kid isn't a Lego player those gifts aren't good. That's why I asked what the boy likes so I can get them something good. If the parent would have said anything is fine, we would have got something. The fact that the explicitly said presents aren't needed is why I didn't buy anything", "So normally we do bring two presents. Also, we do treat them as to separate people. But we are in a small town in a small school and so it's not uncommon for all the kids friends.", "If the parent had responded this way, I absolutely would have got a gift. It's part of the reason phrased it what does the birthday boy like for a present so we could get them something he would actually enjoy. \n\nI have so many presents that my kids received that get played with for a day or two and then never get used again.", "Better.", "I still think you should have taken a gift - it's one of those stupid etiquette things - but NAH.\n\nEdit: I meant NAH, not N T A.", "Then buy something you know wont cause controversy. As I said in another post give money.", "That\u2019s why I said the mum shouldn\u2019t have said it, if you can read", "Personally I wouldn\u2019t turn up to a birthday party without at least a small gift but maybe that\u2019s just me \u2026", "You just said only 1 kid got the invite which is why you had to text them to see if the other twin could go.", "I WISH more people would respect \u201cno gifts.\u201d I\u2019m literally telling you I don\u2019t need or want whatever crap you\u2019re going to buy me out of some feeling of obligation. Buying it anyway is added responsibility and clutter, not a gift.", "You should ask your kids what they would like to do", "You go to a kids' party. You bring a gift for that kid.  That's just common sense.", "Right? This is the first I\u2019ve heard of parents being coy about birthday party presents for a kid. It\u2019s going to be another parent buying the gifts for a child they probably don\u2019t know very well, they need some hints as to what the kid is into if they want gifts.", "\"I have so many presents that my kids received that get played with for a day or two and then never get used again.\"\n\nThen give money for their savings or for a treat. Even get them prize bonds. My neighbour who is 23 got prize bonds for her 1st birthday in 2001 as a present. She recently received 100 euro in the mail as she'd win in one of the draws. Use your imagination."]}
