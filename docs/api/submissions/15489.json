Showing up to a birthday party, especially one for a child, empty handed is just a bad idea all around. At a minimum you should have at least gotten a card and threw a $20 in there.

If nobody else had brought anything, OP's wife could have kept it in her handbag.  Getting too many gifts at a young age when inviting lots of children (or the entire class) can be as problematic as getting none.  When my daughter was at primary school, there were only 14 kids in the class so right from the get-go every kid invited the entire class to their birthday parties.  After the first year the parents discussed the flood of presents this generated and we all agreed that from then on, no child would bring any presents to the party (just a card usually).  Instead, the birthday kid'would get a single, usually slightly larger present \"from the whole class\", chosen and paid for by their parents.  It was a win-win - the parents knew what their son/daughter would like and all the others would not have to worry about what to bring.  It worked brilliantly and we were particularly relieved, since our daughter's birthday is close to Christmas and the huge pile of birthday presents had left her unable to appreciate any one of them.", "NTA we always suggest no presents on the invitation and if people ask.

Big difference- the former is a requirement, the latter is politeness. You misunderstood, it happens. I can see why your wife would have felt embarrassed though.\n\nSo long as they didn't give your wife any grief about it, then it means they meant what they said- you didn't have to bring a gift, and no harm done. But yeah, you shouldn't really need to be told to bring a gift for a kids birthday party, and a lot of people would feel awkward telling you to buy so and so since they don't know your financial situation or what other people are bringing, and they don't want to seem demanding or put pressure on you. Its a frustrating but normal response, at least where I'm from. I agree, it would have been easier to say he enjoys this kind of toy but no pressure to get anything, we just want your kids company.

The twins my kiddo knows have overlapping but different friend groups. \n\nWe have many friends who can\u2019t take any more toys. A gift certificate to the movies works.", "NTA. If your *spouse* took the kids and all three thought a gift was needed, why didn't they stop and get one? This is one of those mental labor posts. Either OP or OPSpouse could have thought about this and chosen to get a gift. It's not all on OP. And, this could have been a teaching moment for the 9yo's. Teach them to speak up and address this with their parents if they wanted to bring a gift and/or for *them* to ask their friend if they wanted a gift and either scout out that friend's interests or directly ask for present ideas.", "I also got the impression that no one looked sideways at the wife and kids for not bringing something, they just felt awkward when they saw that everyone else had brought a gift. Hopefully they can get over it soon. \n\nI really wish there was less of an expectation to always bring a gift to bday parties--it can really be an obstacle for some money- or time-poor parents. Let's just let people come and celebrate without obligations.", "Just bringing any random gift is a stupid idea. OP didn't get *any* insight in what would make a good gift, and getting a gift that would not be appreciated is worse.", "Mind reading games. No one has time.", "People often view twins as one single unit. It's not uncommon for someone to give an invitation to one twin and just assume that the other twin knows they're included. It's ridiculous, but just one of those societal things that no one examines.", "We just had birthday party for my daughter. We asked for new books that would be donated to a local organization.     A couple of people did still bring small things for her, but mostly books", "Yeah but you still bring something, even if it's a snack like you said.  \n\nEveryone always says no gifts needed.  Because they aren't \"needed\" to attend.  But you still bring something even if it's a one time use item that won't stick around.", "Fantastic idea!!!", "One of my friend's children asked for birthday gifts that were suitable for donation to the local family shelters as they had realized that the toys there had so many broken or missing pieces and thought that the kids there could use some new toys. Perhaps you can use this idea to get rid of your unused present stack?", "Top drawer! Open communication is the only way to go!", "You go to a birthday party, you bring a gift. You didn't? YTA. 0 mind games.\n\n\"But parent said...\", because you asked. STFU, bring a gift. Any gift", "I never really like opening gifts as a kid either. There is this whole expectation to perform and act like you love e wry gift you get, it's exhausting. I would just rather not get gifts and just hang out and have fun.", "That's a really great idea, I'm stealing it!", "But the parents of the birthday boy didn't say anything, his wife did. I still think they should have gotten a present, the wife and kids also could've asked....", "But just 5? At least a 10, I think. With that you could buy him a better and bigger gift. Explain that to folks so they don't think they're donating for your next handbag.", "******Welcome!********", "You'll have some awesome AITA flair to show for your first day!  (In 18 hours it gets awarded automatically. )", "Please do! Museums work too! There\u2019s quite a few in my area and I always see my friends taking their kids(I\u2019m childfree). Plus, I\u2019m a teacher, so I\u2019m all about paying for an educational experience!", "He texted the parents. He specifically asked what the kid liked.", "This was pre-pandemic & he had a lot friends come to his party. Between that & what his grandparents gave him, he had close to $100.", "Eh, when kids are not teens, I don\u2019t think they need more than $5 (especially if they\u2019re getting multiples of the amount). I swear, people hit family/friends with inflation on their kids\u2019 money too. I mean, the eight year old isn\u2019t buying essentials for their life, they\u2019re buying treats and maybe toys or (hopefully) learning how to save up for longer term treats.  When l\u2019m buying an item, then I\u2019ll spend whatever the item costs, but if I\u2019m just tucking money into the an envelope, my rule of thumb to walk the line between \u201cjust $5\u201d and having to tack another five on every year, is to match the dollar amount to the kid\u2019s age for pure money gifts i.e. 8 year old gets $8.", "I mean, your friend group sounds wild. My friends might not be able to afford a wedding gift because they\u2019re trying to pay college debt, mortgages, diapers and baby formula.", "I got married 23 years ago and the only person who didn\u2019t get us a gift out of 150+ was a woman who used to be friends with my mom. Her daughter was friends with my sister in grade school. She called me the day before our reception (we had a destination wedding and a reception at home) and asked if she could come. I said yes.\n\nShe also brought her daughter and daughter\u2019s two beastly children. Her son (about 7 or 8) crawled under the reception table at dinner and lifted my dress so everyone could see. I didn\u2019t know what was happening and I kicked him. HARD.\n\nThe next day we opened gifts and of course, nothing from any of them.\n\nThe daughter has since reached out to me on Facebook (I barely use it and my parents nor my sister have it at all) but I just blocked her.\n\nNope, I will never forget that.", "I mean, your friend group sounds wild. My friends might not be able to afford a wedding gift because they\u2019re trying to pay college debt, mortgages, diapers and baby formula.", "Thank you!!\n\naddictive, isn't it?!", "really? cool!", "I love all these ideas. \nI want to add steam train tickets (for those in Europe that live in proximity to a steam train they still runs).\nSwimming pool tickets, if you live close to one of those really nice ones.\nAdventure park tickets, where you get to do obstacle courses in the trees and such are also awesome. And I personally love getting kids out in nature. \n\nAnd if you have no fun/educational attractions near you I'd recommend getting crafting supplies. But then something they don't always get. Like a white t-shirt or pillow case with fabric markers.", "Doesn't matter imo. Common courtesy, especially if it's a kid", "Common courtesy to be a mind reader? Nah. \n\nHe asked, was told no gift necessary. If its expected, just say. Not everyone likes to live in a state of perpetual anxiety.", "It isn't being a mind reader to have common sense.  \n\nEveryone knows you still bring stuff and that people will say you don't have to because it's polite.  \n\nIf there's truly no gifts at an event you should still bring a single use item for the party or snacks or something.  You should *want* to provide something.  \n\nThere's no anxiety or anything if you just remember to always send something.", "No gift necessary doesn't mean don't bring anything."]}
