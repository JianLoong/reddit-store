Showing up to a birthday party, especially one for a child, empty handed is just a bad idea all around. At a minimum you should have at least gotten a card and threw a $20 in there.

If nobody else had brought anything, OP's wife could have kept it in her handbag.  Getting too many gifts at a young age when inviting lots of children (or the entire class) can be as problematic as getting none.  When my daughter was at primary school, there were only 14 kids in the class so right from the get-go every kid invited the entire class to their birthday parties.  After the first year the parents discussed the flood of presents this generated and we all agreed that from then on, no child would bring any presents to the party (just a card usually).  Instead, the birthday kid'would get a single, usually slightly larger present \"from the whole class\", chosen and paid for by their parents.  It was a win-win - the parents knew what their son/daughter would like and all the others would not have to worry about what to bring.  It worked brilliantly and we were particularly relieved, since our daughter's birthday is close to Christmas and the huge pile of birthday presents had left her unable to appreciate any one of them.", "NTA we always suggest no presents on the invitation and if people ask.

Big difference- the former is a requirement, the latter is politeness. You misunderstood, it happens. I can see why your wife would have felt embarrassed though.\n\nSo long as they didn't give your wife any grief about it, then it means they meant what they said- you didn't have to bring a gift, and no harm done. But yeah, you shouldn't really need to be told to bring a gift for a kids birthday party, and a lot of people would feel awkward telling you to buy so and so since they don't know your financial situation or what other people are bringing, and they don't want to seem demanding or put pressure on you. Its a frustrating but normal response, at least where I'm from. I agree, it would have been easier to say he enjoys this kind of toy but no pressure to get anything, we just want your kids company.

Unless I knew the parents well, I wouldn't bring a gift if I was told this", "Disagree. \u201cNo presents needed\u201d is a bad response by the other parents. It\u2019s a yes or no question. Answering it in a non-commital way sets up this exact situation. \n\nAnd who doesn\u2019t take a present to a 9 yo\u2019s bday party? Anyone coming to my kid\u2019s party. Kid\u2019s got enough stuff already. Save your money. Have some cake.\n\nEdit: also, when asked \u201cwhat present would your son like?\u201d And you respond \u201cno present necessary\u201d, that\u2019s most reasonably interpreted as \u201cNo present\u201d", "Did you completely misread the post? He didn't ask if he needed to bring a present! He asked what the birthday boy would like. That questing in absolutely no way would make any sane person think he had a financial or religious obstacle to gifts.

Have some cake.", "u/bluebook2000 \n\nDid you completely miss where OP asked what the birthday kid liked so they could find a present? When the answer is \"no present needed\" and not followed up with \"but this is what he likes if you do want to get them something\" , then the idea is NO PRESENT. OP DID NOT MESS UP AT ALL.", "NTA,  If your wife and kids think it's such a big deal just go out.", "What should they have gotten the kid then? They didn\u2019t ask if they should bring presents, they asked what the birthday boy likes and they didn\u2019t tell him. This isn\u2019t on OP.", "The guy asked what the kids like so he could get a present. The parent then said no presents are needed. If the parent was saying they aren't needed but appreciated then they should have answered \" they arent needed but if you'd like to bring one here is what kid likes\".

I wouldn't say anything, but definitely annoyed that people didn't listen to my request.", "Please take a moment to realize that other people can feel differently than you. What's normal or common sense to you is not necessarily normal or common sense to someone else.", "Yes, it's surprising more people didn't pick up on how it was weird for OP to ask if the non-invited twin could attend the party, too. They are individual humans, not a boxed set.", "OP clarified in a comment that there wasn't a specific name on the card so wanted to ask if it was meant for one of the kids or both. I think that's considerate. The parent should also have said something like \"presents arent necessary but if you want to bring something here is what kid likes\". Many people don't understand the hidden meanings behind things and need clarification or options. OP did exactly what the parent said.", "To be fair, of it wasn't for a scheduling conflict, I would have shown up empty handed. It wasn't like I intentionally tried to make my wife do it.", "If some one asks what my kid wants that tells me they care about my kid and want to get them something they will actually enjoy. I don't understand why that would be awkward. She also said they aren't needed so I would take that as don't bring one as well. She should have been direct and said \"they arent needed but if you feel inclined to get one here is what kid likes\". I know my family and I either put what the kid likes on the invite or put a link to a registry so there are no weird guessing games or assumptions that people are tied to the same societal norms as me", "Not every parent wants gifts tho. Respect the instructions given to you. \n\nIf I said no gifts I would hate that people ignored my request", "And Ops wife could have said something sooner too. At least when she was driving them to the party she could have realized that there are no presents and could have gotten something small on the way if it was the polite thing to do. I mean she only complaint about it afterwards after she felt like a fool. I guess it's a NAH, it's just an unfortunate miscommunication. Just treat the birthday kid to some ice cream or something as an apology or take him with you when you're going to some family fun time place (like a swimming pool)", "Yup, just got home from a party. \n\nWe asked, do they want a present? Was told, not necessary but if you do, one of these three things please. \n\nGot a present anyway.", "Yeah, I hate it when people play games like that. It\u2019s like when someone tells you they don\u2019t like valentines day and don\u2019t want to celebrate it but then get pissed off when you take them at their word. Just say what you mean :////", "I hate this so much. \n\nWent to a party yesterday for my friends 2 year old. No presents needed on the invite, when I asked they said not to get anything.... We still got some small things (book, some bubbles, sidewalk chalk).

OP asked flat out and is now being scolded for not using his telepathy to understand that he absolutely does need to bring a gift? \n\nPeople need to communicate properly instead.", "That\u2019s up to you. I can see your point but like I said personally I wouldn\u2019t turn up to a party completely empty handed, it just seems rude. Also what parent doesn\u2019t want their child to have presents on their birthday?", "I think you should have realized that most people aren't going to call the parents and ask, they are just going to bring a gift. So your kids were going to be one of the only ones without a gift. So, you aren't an AH, but if you had thought things through a little more, your kids wouldn't have been embarrassed.", "No one likes to be caught off guard.  Even parents who struggle manage a trip to Five Below or the dollar store for a little present to take.  You're learning a lesson here, and you may have to work harder on social conventions.", "The minute you asked if the second twin could come to the party, you're treating them as a unit. I know it's far more convenient if both of them go the same direction for a day, But that isn't how individuals work", "When people do the \"No presents needed\" I agree with you, I assume they don't want more stuff in their house.  In that case, I get some food treats for the kids so parents house doesn't get more cluttered.", "Kids love gift cards.", "Just bc everyone ignored the no gift ask doesn't mean they were in the right.

You're going to have a ton of people responding on your comment who aren't really looking for you to respond personally.  They're just adding to what you said to help the OP further and uts more likely to be seen by other Redditors if they attach to your comment rather than making a new parent comment.  You really, really don't need to respond to all the comments on your comment.", "You also said E S H, which is not supported by the facts", "Exactly. Personally when we invite people we put on the invite what the kid likes so there arent weird guessing games.", "Plenty and for a multitude of reasons. They already have too many generic toys/gifts. I honestly didn't want gifts at my birthday parties as a kid. I didn't care for most of the typical gifts.

How do you just show up empty handed?", "But she brought an extra guest, so . . . \ud83d\ude44", "I feel like people are so stuck on what used to be the norm. Calling to ask what the kid would want is super nice and considerate. Buying random junk the kid may already have or has no interest in, to me, shows a lack of caring", "Yes, nothing says beong polite, like giving some cheap plastic crap that's going to clutter the house and wind up in a landfill.", "Social etiquette is such an arbitrary thing. It's not the same for everyone.", "Zoo/aquarium tickets!

Instead of presents parents were asked to \u201cdonate\u201d $5 to their bday fund. Much less expensive & time consuming than having to buy a present & kid got to pick out what they wanted for themselves.", "I can't imagine bringing scratch cards to a 9-year-old classmate's birthday party as gifts would go over well.", "Thank you. This is Day 1 of my account so I have a lot to learn!", "I\u2019ll agree to disagree with you on this. I believe it\u2019s good etiquette to take something to a party, whether it\u2019s a birthday party, dinner party, whatever, it\u2019s polite to offer something. But Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I Guess we just have different opinions and views on life.", "I think most people let their child pick their friends' presents, because it's fun for them. I don't think there is anything wrong with that. Sure, maybe the presents won't be great, but the child will have fun choosing them and the friend will enjoy opening them.", "Not really, it's pretty much a given to bring a present to s kids party and likewise I've never in my life heard of a parent calling another parent to ask them what the birthday child wanted. That's bizarre.", "Yep.  My go-to gift for kids and teens is a gift card for the local movie theater.  Most of the gift cards are good for tickets and concessions.  Easy to pick up or have on hand for last minute gifts.", "Yes that sounds fine. A bit off topic but I know people who go to weddings and don't give any present. They day they can't afford to yet have plenty of cash for cocaine etc.\n\nI just think that is such bad manners and I'd be mortified if I did that. Interestingly I've too close mates who got married years ago and they are still able to tell me the people who gave no present. Those things do get noticed and remembered and I totally understand that. It's not the money/ gift, it's more the principle.", "Valid! I think it always depends on the host. I do often bring wine or something to a dinner party or gathering. Or for adult birthday parties I ask if I could bring a dish or something", "Why is that bizarre?? I want to give a gift that will be wanted. I have been to and hosted several birthdays where gifts were unwanted. It's not a given", "In theory I agree, but it's a big jump from can't bring a wedding gift but can afford cocaine - who is your friend group?", "So are you telling me you ring up the parents of kids when your own kids go to their parties to ask them what they want ?", "Well the people I know who didn't give presents to my friends or whom confess they can't afford ones so don't get one are people i know who take cocaine,wear flashy clothes and live in comfort pretty much. They don't appear to be on the breadline...", "It's a case by case. Depends on how well my kids know the other kid. \n\n\"Hey there, x is so excited to come to y's bday, he wants to make sure he gets y a really great gift, do you have any recommendations? Is Y still really into this thing?\" \n\nYou're making it weirder than it has to be", "If you don't care how the recipient feels about the gift then you are giving for the wrong reasons"]}
