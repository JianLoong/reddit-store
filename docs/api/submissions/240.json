Nope, as long as you do it in a genuinely nice and not passive aggressive or threatening way, it certainly wouldn't bother me. Especially since you aren't asking them to stop smoking, you're asking for a change in scent/smoke management. \n\nYou could even sweeten the deal by bringing them a wax warmer (6 dollars at walmart) and some wax cubes (1-3 dollars). It masks the smell really well without adding more smoke to the situation, like incense does, and incense is the stoner go-to. \n\nGood luck, and good for you for complaining considerately. :)", "NAH - Its understandable that you don't want to do passive smoking. Passive smoking is also a health hazard. Since smoking isn't illegal or against the rule, you just cannot demand them to stop it that instant. I think you should politely request your neighbor about this and sort it out peacefully. You can't simply stop them but try compromising some things since you are new in the neighborhood.", "Nope NTA. The neighbor behind me smokes a blunt regularly, that smell works its way through closed windows. If there isn\u2019t a lot of wind it\u2019s pretty bad.   I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s sitting in his backyard smoking it because he doesn\u2019t want his house to smell like that either. \n\nI did not talk to him, but I have a huge fan that I put out on my back porch. When I smell it, I turned that sucker on problem solved. Don\u2019t know if there\u2019s something you can do that is similar.", "NTA but I would not suggest going to the HOA or anything like that. If I were you I would just nicely ask them if they could not do that anymore. Most pot heads are pretty nice and non-confrontational.", "NTA. Talk to them and come up with a compromise. They may not know it\u2019s bothering you. I\u2019m sure there is something to be worked out.", "As someone who smokes weed, your NTA, although I could understand if they refuse because having your own space where you feel comfortable and super relaxed to smoke is such an amazing thing and then being asked if you could move that spot (which is hard) could be upsetting. Maybe recommend them getting an air purifier or a huge fan to blow it a different direction.", "You're annoying. Yes YWBTA.", "INFO\n\n> I find the smell to be quite disgusting\n\nSo why are living in a **_very_** cannabis-friendly state?\n\nI mean, you've got your pick of LOTS of places to live where this isn't even an issue.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

People don't realize that all smoke is harmful and that yes it does travel. I've had smokers themselves in prevention focus groups say that 20 feet away from buildings isn't far enough, but also you want where they go to be comfortable so maybe come up with some suggestions based on the complex layout.", "Yeah I hear you. It\u2019s really tough because my kitchen and bathroom window are literally feet from their garage. Like I said we live above their garage so it\u2019s as if they\u2019re doing it in the kitchen lol. I have fans and air purifiers running constantly as well", "regardless of whether or not its legal here, it could happen anywhere, in any state. When I was born in 1997 in California I didn't choose for my home state to legalize Marijuana. Like I said, I don't care if people use and smoke it but I find it rude that people will not do it in their house to keep smell out of their house, but in turn allow it to come into my house instead.", "But you guys voted that you wanted that allowed.", "I don\u2019t understand how that makes it cool for me to have to smell somebody else\u2019s shit every day multiple times a day? \n\nNot everybody voted yes my friend", "> it frustrates me that my house is susceptible to their odors at any time they please. \n\nTHIS \\^\\^\\^ is not an attitude that's conducive to happiness *anywhere*.\n\nThe world is big, the boundaries of your exclusive-use area are fuzzier than you'd like, and there's **_always_** going to be outside forces you can't control.\n\nThe path to happiness lies in acceptance, not resistance.", "That's exactly what it felt like with other smoker's for years."]}
