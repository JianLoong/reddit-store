IF you're not willing to do that for a kid  you supposedly love and want to adopt, then you aren't acting in the best interests of the child.

You don\u2019t get your way so you decide you\u2019ll hound her for $60k retroactive backpay??  And how the hell does adopting him even make any sense?\n\nEither continue to help with both kids out of the goodness of your heart, or make an agreement with her of what you agree to do.  Quit using a child to prove a point or get your way. \n\nIt\u2019s obvious by calling him her love child that you\u2019re harboring some resentment or bitterness.

I understand this is emotional for you, but your communication here is not constructive. Calling her a bad mom is not constructive.", "ESH please don't use your genuine love for a kid as a lever to win a fight with your ex. All the good you did was good because you did it freely. If you now take legal action to get paid for it, it cancels out the good will, and think how Cameron would feel to hear that you were being nice just because you were expecting a reward. And no, it doesn't entitle you to adoption. Your reactions suck a lot, go check yourself! Maybe you're letting an argument get to you.", "ESH. You're wife's comment was pretty insensitive considering all of the time you have put in helping raise Cameron. Since you are the one picking him up from school, it would make sense for you to have some say in the matter. Cameron's mother should have the final say in where her son attends school since you are not his legal guardian, but completely dismissing your input makes her the AH.\n\nIf you really care about Cameron you shouldn't use him as a bargaining tool. If you really do think of yourself as a father figure the care you give Cameron shouldn't be conditional. The fact that you were able to come up with such a specific number also shows this wasn't some spur of the moment dig at your ex. If you really love the kid you wouldn't care about money and this just seems like some vindictive plot to get back at her.", "ESH. She should consider your feelings on the matter if you're going to be the one picking him up from said school, but your weird passive aggressiveness also makes you the asshole. You guys need to grow up before your sons start resenting one or both of you", "NTA, mostly, with a bit of Y-T-A thrown in. I think a lot of posters are missing the point where she reminds OP that he is not Cameron's father but yet has relied on him to care for Cameron for the past three years. It's not anyone's fault that OP has become a father (more than a father figure) to Cameron, as evidenced by him introducing OP to his teacher as his dad. The ex trivialized the relationship OP and Cameron have built over this time. So OP's ex's comment must have cut very deeply. Hence the \"Pay me babysitter wages then,\" reply. But, here's the Y-T-A part: the animosity isn't hurting OP or his ex; it's hurting Cameron and Liam. Do they really want to tear Cameron from the only man who he sees as his dad? Do they want to build a wall between the two boys by the way they're emphasizing the difference in OP's relationship with them? Finally, OP, stressing that you are going to hound your ex over the cost of babysitting Cameron over the past three years isn't proving the love you say you feel for him; it's stating the opposite. Your ex could use that comment to break Cameron's heart and make him hate you. \"He's not your dad. He never was. He was only your babysitter and now he's trying to take all my money!\"", "ESH for using Cameron as leverage to get their own way.", "ESH. Her for taking the help for granted, and you for using a child as a weapon", "NTA. Conveniently you're \"not the father\" when it's advantageous for her. You're not wrong, just be sure to not punish the kids in the midst of all this.", "NTA. Just be prepared to lose any contact with Cameron, as there's a better-than-even chance that ends up happening.", "NTA: She needlessly escalated the argument by pulling the \u201cCameron isn\u2019t your son\u201d card, when you were going above and beyond for that kid. You suggested something that made sense, to make your life easier, and she flatly rejected it. She made a decision that has consequences. Usually this is called, \u201cFuck around and find out.\u201d", "Go to child care support court or something. Have a court order that says if you are the primary care giver of Cameron, she has to post her fair share of dues. They will go back to the time when you started caring for him, plus an amount every week or month. Do that instead of asking for outlandish amounts.", "NTA. I mean you can't actually get any money from her for past actions as you had no agreement for payment, hopefully you realize that and your demand is just trying to prove a point. As someone else says here,  it's interesting how he's suddenly\"but your kids\" when your input becomes inconvenient for her but the relationship is totally fine when it works (and I'm going to guess that you probably are buying things for the boy as well). \n\nYou guys probably should have a serious conversation about your role, legally as well, and if you truly want to adopt him if she would be willing to allow that. If she isn't, you're going to have to decide for yourself what type of role your okay with knowing that it'll stay undefined.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
