If you really do think of yourself as a father figure the care you give Cameron shouldn't be conditional. The fact that you were able to come up with such a specific number also shows this wasn't some spur of the moment dig at your ex.

I think a lot of posters are missing the point where she reminds OP that he is not Cameron's father but yet has relied on him to care for Cameron for the past three years. It's not anyone's fault that OP has become a father (more than a father figure) to Cameron, as evidenced by him introducing OP to his teacher as his dad. The ex trivialized the relationship OP and Cameron have built over this time. So OP's ex's comment must have cut very deeply. Hence the \"Pay me babysitter wages then,\" reply. But, here's the Y-T-A part: the animosity isn't hurting OP or his ex; it's hurting Cameron and Liam. Do they really want to tear Cameron from the only man who he sees as his dad? Do they want to build a wall between the two boys by the way they're emphasizing the difference in OP's relationship with them? Finally, OP, stressing that you are going to hound your ex over the cost of babysitting Cameron over the past three years isn't proving the love you say you feel for him; it's stating the opposite. Your ex could use that comment to break Cameron's heart and make him hate you. \"He's not your dad. He never was. He was only your babysitter and now he's trying to take all my money!\"", "ESH for using Cameron as leverage to get their own way.", "ESH.

I mean you can't actually get any money from her for past actions as you had no agreement for payment, hopefully you realize that and your demand is just trying to prove a point. As someone else says here,  it's interesting how he's suddenly\"but your kids\" when your input becomes inconvenient for her but the relationship is totally fine when it works (and I'm going to guess that you probably are buying things for the boy as well). \n\nYou guys probably should have a serious conversation about your role, legally as well, and if you truly want to adopt him if she would be willing to allow that.
