I had to tell Ben that he was not our kids' dad in anyway, shape or form and never will be. Our kids are not going to look at you as my equal or as a \"bonus daddy.\" Sounds harsh but I believe in establishing boundaries and he said he understood. \n\nI feel like Ben is very depressed over not having kids and he's trying to have \"daddy\" moments with my kids at my expense. I'm not again his bonding with my sons. For example, I was fine with him taking my 8yo son to a Father-Son Game Night at his school because he asked me which was respectful.\n\nMy ex and I share 50/50 custody of our two sons although we both end up seeing them almost everyday. I have them this week. They do have a backpack that they bring to and from me and their mom's house. I was going through my 10yo son Jimmy's and found deodorant. I thought that was odd and maybe his mom gave it to him.\n\nI asked Jimmy if the deodorant was his and he said yes. I asked who got it for him and he said Ben took him to Target to buy some yesterday. Then he tells me did you know you can put deodorant down there too?\n\nI texted Ben to call me. I asked him if he had bought Jimmy deodorant and he said yes. He reeked after he had picked him up from school and they went to Target. And yes, he told Jimmy that you can put deodorant on other areas of your body like your feet and down there too.\n\nI told Ben that okay I think I understand why you did what you did but that was something that I should had handled as the dad. It's not like taking my 8yo to an event that happens every year or whatever. I don't want to find out that my kids are having these once in a lifetime dad-son moments with you and not me. That's the burden of being a step-dad. It's not about trust because I know there were times when they had sensitive issues and I wasn't readily accessible and they weren't comfortable going to Mom so they went to you and I never had an issue with that. Just be more mindful.\n\nHe said dude, it's just deodorant. It's like toothpaste. I said look, you crossed a boundary and I am not being a bitch and complained to your wife. I coming to you directly. He didn't say anything. I did feel a bit bad but then I remind myself that I'm not obligated to share my daddy duties with him.", "created_utc": 1679743188, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121it2y/aita_for_telling_my_sons_stepdad_that_he_crossed/", "score": 475, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is not even a boundary.  Your son smelled and his step dad got him deodorant and explained to him what it\u2019s used for.   Obviously you didn\u2019t do your job properly if your 10yo son didn\u2019t know about deodorant prior to this.   Be glad your son has a stepdad that actually cares for him and willing to step on areas.   This is no different than a teacher telling their students about deodorant.   You seem to have a weird jealousy over this man", "YTA\n\nYou're being too possessive and controlling and it's not healthy. Not for you or your son. Your son deserves a better version of you, not whatever this is.\n\nThere's going to be things you miss out on when you split custody. It's a fact of life. \n\nYou're making a mountain out of a molehill. It's just deodorant. The kid smelled and needed deodorant. His stepfather handled it on his and his wife's parenting day. They make parenting decisions on their parenting time. If your ex wants him being a proper stepdad, that's her choice. You tried to intimidate him because of your insecurities and they're not having it. Work through that before your own kids start to pull away from you.", "Once in a lifetime father-son moments like your son stinking when he gets in the car? Ah, yes what a classic bonding experience.\n\nWhat was he supposed to do, let the kid go to school smelly the next day too? Or were you going to drop everything and come over that night for this special shopping trip?\n\nBen's right. It is just deoderant. And further, if he's 'reeking' at this point, I doubt this is the very first day he's ever had BO, so why haven't you as his dad already addressed that?\n\nBe glad that your kid has a - yep, a bonus dad, whether you like it or not - who takes good care of your kid when he's with him.\n\nYTA", "YTA.

Someday, I will tell my grandkids about the once-in-a-lifetime moment where I rubbed on my first stick of deodorant. There's a small statue in my town commemorating the event, in fact.\n\nYou have 50/50 custody, but never noticed your son had body odor, nor did you teach the kid enough about hygiene or deodorant. I'm betting Jimmy didn't spontaneously start stinking up the joint on that day when Ben picked him up. Ben noticed a hygiene issue and her helped Jimmy. This isn't a special Kodak moment.

Be careful that your kids won't decide that they can do without the control freak.", "YTA The reason for my judgment is your being selfish. I get it you feel like you should be the one doing all the \"special moments\" but if you keep going eventually your kids will catch on and cut you from their lives. Everyone deserves all the love in the world so does your kids, let the step dad have this it's the only time the poor guy will be any form of parent in his life. Stop being so protective and do some self reflection.", "Yta. \n\nYou seem super insecure in your relationship with your kids. You should be happy that your sons have Ben in their lives. He seems engaged and caring. Who wouldn't want their children to be surrounded by people who love and support them?", "YTA - did you want your kid to stink until he next saw you? Ben is dying what an uncle would do if the kids was staying with the uncle while you were away on business. Getting deodorant is a necessity and a new one so Ben showed the kid how to use it. He didn't yeah him to shave or anything like that. \n\nAlso how involved Ben is a cover between you, Your ex, Ben and the kid. I think it's appropriate to ask about the explicit father son things, which Ben did, but he shouldn't have to ask before they play catch or go fishing because that's a an activity that has some father son implications.", "I think you are jealous of him having a relationship with them just personally. You are going to cause your kids grief if you keep this up, it is difficult enough for kids to navigate a new normal after a breakup, and you are just making it harder for them. Grow up. YTA.", "YTA\n\nWhat boundary did he cross? The not letting your kid be the stinky kid in school line? What would you have done if it was the school health teacher or nurse that handed out the deodorant? \n\nSeriously, your kids can never have too many people in their lives that care about them. Stop letting your own insecurities get in the way of your kids happiness & well-being. \n\nYou\u2019re in a weird pissing contest with Ben. Just stop. Your kids will be the ones who suffer from this ridiculous behavior. Being a parent gives you no rights to every \u201cfirst\u201d in their lives.

You do not get to decide the level of bond your children have with their stepfather. You are an asshole for thinking that you control how your children feel about their mother's partner.

If you didn't want them to have a stepfather, you should have done whatever you needed to stay married to their mother, but since that didn't happen, you and your ex have to respect the children enough to not create drama in their other home. \n\nThe dude sounds respectful and conscientious of your relationship with the kids, but preventing your kid from being the stinky kid is a higher priority than waiting for you to get around to doing it. If he didn't do it in a timely manner, you'd be mad that he ignored a fundamental need of your child and you'd be blasting your ex and her good for nothing new husband who let your kid get bullied or some other level of BS that only comes from dudes that think they own their kids 24/7 and are only delegating the unexciting parts of parenting to their subordinate parents.

You would really rather your children never feel like they can trust and care about Ben so it doesn\u2019t damage your fragile little ego. Ben helped your son when he was in a position to be made fun of and ostracized and instead of saying thanks all you think about is yourself.

It sounds to me that Ben is a very respectful and responsible person who genuinely cares about your kids. How about being glad your ex found someone more than decent for your kids to grow up with and with whom they can have a nice relationship? \n\nSecondly, it really is just deodorant ffs, what was he supposed to do anyway??? Your son smelled, would you rather have your son go around reeking of sweat and possibly get bullied because of it than his stepdad taking him to buy fucking deodorant? Which one of the two do you think is a better example of what a responsible father figure should do?\n\nAnd lastly, your kids loving their step dad does not mean they're gonna stop loving you, that's honestly the kind of reasoning i would expect from a 3yo. \"Mommy and Daddy had another baby, will they stop loving me now? \ud83e\udd7a\" Grow the fuck up.", "... poor guy is just trying to live his life.

I had to tell Ben that he was not our kids' dad in anyway, shape or form and never will be. Our kids are not going to look at you as my equal or as a \"bonus daddy.\" Sounds harsh but I believe in establishing boundaries and he said he understood. \n\nI feel like Ben is very depressed over not having kids and he's trying to have \"daddy\" moments with my kids at my expense. I'm not again his bonding with my sons. For example, I was fine with him taking my 8yo son to a Father-Son Game Night at his school because he asked me which was respectful.\n\nMy ex and I share 50/50 custody of our two sons although we both end up seeing them almost everyday. I have them this week. They do have a backpack that they bring to and from me and their mom's house. I was going through my 10yo son Jimmy's and found deodorant. I thought that was odd and maybe his mom gave it to him.\n\nI asked Jimmy if the deodorant was his and he said yes. I asked who got it for him and he said Ben took him to Target to buy some yesterday. Then he tells me did you know you can put deodorant down there too?\n\nI texted Ben to call me. I asked him if he had bought Jimmy deodorant and he said yes. He reeked after he had picked him up from school and they went to Target. And yes, he told Jimmy that you can put deodorant on other areas of your body like your feet and down there too.\n\nI told Ben that okay I think I understand why you did what you did but that was something that I should had handled as the dad. It's not like taking my 8yo to an event that happens every year or whatever. I don't want to find out that my kids are having these once in a lifetime dad-son moments with you and not me. That's the burden of being a step-dad. It's not about trust because I know there were times when they had sensitive issues and I wasn't readily accessible and they weren't comfortable going to Mom so they went to you and I never had an issue with that. Just be more mindful.\n\nHe said dude, it's just deodorant. It's like toothpaste. I said look, you crossed a boundary and I am not being a bitch and complained to your wife. I coming to you directly. He didn't say anything. I did feel a bit bad but then I remind myself that I'm not obligated to share my daddy duties with him.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He's not going to look back and be like \"wow, I remember the day Ben gave me deodorant\" because it's not a milestone. Bonding with your kid, building a relationship, it''s about supporting their physical and emotional needs. Your child's emotional needs are for him to receive love and care. You should want that for your son. But instead you are jealous that another adult cares about him. Instead of showing your son you love him by working with other adults to support his development, you are showing that no, his needs aren't the priority. *Yours* are. Your need for control. You literally are telling Ben \"you must put my feelings above my child's needs\". All this does to a child is teaches them: Dad cares more about his ego than me. He cares more about getting his way than me being cared for.\n\nBuild that bond with your kid by getting to know him, hanging out with him, and embracing the fact that he thankfully is living with a step-parent that cares for his needs too.

You think you\u2019re going to get replaced, you get scared, and you act a fool. You\u2019re not going to get replaced. This is someone else that loves your kid and is going to be a parent too - get over it. If your ex told your new girlfriend all these things, how would you feel?  Having a healthy coparenting relationship is best for your son. Also, just adding that it\u2019s DEODORANT. It\u2019s a basic toiletry - not a boundary. I sincerely think you need therapy if you\u2019re feeling threatened by your kid\u2019s stepdad buying him deodorant.\n\nActually, upon reading all your comments, I\u2019d like to amend mine by saying you definitely need therapy.

But because you've done a good thing and created a positive parenting arrangement, another responsible, caring adult was there to help with his needs.
