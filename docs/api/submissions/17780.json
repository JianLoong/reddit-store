You can sit in a few places- the art room, the lunchroom, even the hallway (where I usually sit). However, the most comfortable room is the chill room. It\u2019s a really nice room with dim lights and lots of comfy places to sit.\nAll of these spaces are meant to be used by anyone. One day, I decided to sit in the chill room! There\u2019s always the same group of people that sit there every day, and they let me sit in the room. I minded my own dang business sitting on a comfortable chair, it was nice to just be around people. \nI went there again the next day, and one girl told me they wanted to talk about private things and if I could leave. I said sure and went back to where I usually sit. This happened the next day as well, and I was confused. The third day they asked me to leave, I tried explaining to them that I liked being there, and that it is a public space. They explained that they don\u2019t want anyone not in their friend group to sit there, making it clear I\u2019m not welcome. I left crying. It didn\u2019t click in my mind what was so private, I didn\u2019t know why it felt like such a personal attack even though they said it wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know why I even tried to sit in there again.\nI talked to my social worker about the situation. She asked if I wanted her to talk to them saying they can\u2019t kick me out, and in the moment I said no. I didn\u2019t want them to get in trouble.\nThis was over a month ago, but it all came to a head recently. I wanted to sit in there again because I just wanted to be there. I talked to the social worker before going in, saying that I wanted to try again but was nervous. She said she would be in the area if anything happened.\n\nI went in there, and they didn\u2019t ask me to leave yet! There were teachers chatting in the hallway, my social worker included. Soon though, they asked me to leave and I didn\u2019t. They explained that they thought I was breaking their boundaries, and that everyone was uncomfortable with me being in there. I explained that I should be able to be in a public space, and that they don\u2019t own the room. They talked to me for a few minutes. Some people were nicer than others- it varied from \u201cplease leave,\u201d to \u201cGTFO we don\u2019t want you here\u201d I left. \nI went to my spot in the hallway on one of the couches, and began crying. I tried to calm down, but my social worker walked past and asked me what happened. I explained the situation, and she said something similar to \u201cOf course it happens when I leave to get coffee.\u201d She went in there.  Then the principal and a teachers came. It was a big mess.\nMy social worker told me later that the group was not nice to them.

I'm sorry that happened to you. They were mean and controlling. You have the right to sit there just as much as they do.
