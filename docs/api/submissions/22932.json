Because of this he has always gotten a free pass and they were over protective A H\u2019s. Unfortunately always giving him a free pass, it led to behavior problems and addiction problems too.  By the time they realized that they were part of the problem, getting our oldest help was extremely hard. I came into his life at 14, once he turned 18 he could decline help and treatment.

You forgot snacks? I usually didn\u2019t carry snacks around for my kids. They weren\u2019t starved by any stretch of the imagination either. If we had just had lunch and it was a couple of hours drive, then I would have been more concerned about someone wanting to pee than snacks. (I should also add that my kids didn\u2019t snack much at home either, but there was always something around if they were hungry.) Asking a child to wait while two children who are unable to clean themselves up isn\u2019t inept or neglectful parenting. If you have more than one child, you are going to run into times when everyone needs something at the same time & you have to prioritize things. It sucks, but it is a reality.

There are ways to deal with messy kids on car rides.  Trash bags in the car, a sheet to protect the seat, etc.  then says car ride took four hours?!   And then you expect a ten year old blind child to sit on a sofa in a home she is unfamiliar with?!  While you and your wife attend to the little ones?   You seriously could not take two minutes to grab her a snack?  Stop at a drive thru?  Your young ones already needed changing.  Two more minutes was not going to hurt them.  And you cannot tell me it would have only been ten minutes until you hit Sophie some food.  You and your wife sound horrible.", "ESH. It sounds like a mess all round, but you should always bring snacks on a trip with kids, no matter how long. What's the worst that could happen? You got some crumbs in the car maybe? Would it really that big a deal if they made a mess of the car? They're kids!", "I\u2019m not going to judge here, what I am going to say is if you\u2019re worried about your car being dirty you should be more creative on how to keep it clean. Try putting a plastic tarp on the floor to catch crumbs, buy seat covers (they sell ones that go under car seats). Even if the trip was only supposed to be 2 hours you should\u2019ve had snacks. Apple slices or cuties would be good because they don\u2019t have crumbs and are pretty easy to pick up. I HATE my car being dirty but I would rather clean it than let my 18mo be hungry. I ALWAYS have snacks in his backpack so he can eat as he wants to eat. Even at worst if you had just packed a few sandwiches and snacks you could\u2019ve handed them out as soon as you got to your destination and that would\u2019ve given you a break from cranky children.", "Info- what time did the car ride start? What are the kids meal times?", "Agree with the snacks part - you don\u2019t plan a drive with small kids and not bring something for them to munch on. \n\nBut a 10yo can wait 15 minutes for her food while a baby and a toddler are cleaned of poop. The priority OP and his wife set here were perfectly fine. They should have planned better, yes. But BIL was way out of line.", "I was thinking too much of the scenario op described but you're right. They could have easily stopped for food as that became a problem or brought snacks.", "it\u2019s really not. i don\u2019t understand the strong reactions here. i\u2019ve raised 8 kids and it\u2019s always a juggling act of prioritizing the most pressing needs. sure, bringing snacks would have been a good idea. but shit happens. in this case, literally. i think it\u2019s safe to assume Sophie had eaten that day and wasn\u2019t being starved. four hours between meals is pretty normal.", "She didn\u2019t wait just 15 minutes though. She was stuck in the car for 4 hours prior to that.", "Especially when traffic isn\u2019t moving.", "It doesn't matter. When you go on a trip with your kids, you pack supplies just in case. This is day one shit.", "Just bring snacks. It\u2019s not hard to bring food and water in a car. I don\u2019t understand your thinking here at all.\n\nI don\u2019t believe that there were no exits you could get off in a four hour traffic jam to get food.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t make kids sit in filthy diapers for hours.", "And while that's a great Plan A, not bringing snacks just in case was foolish. You could have prevented this entire situation with basic foresight.", "Next time just pack some fruit and sandwiches even on 1 hour rides.\n\n\nYta for being so defensive about a mistake you made.", "YTA, I\u2019m sorry but not packing snacks for a supposed 2 hour car journey to avoid mess is utterly ridiculous! Especially with a 2 year old.\n\nI don\u2019t think that cleaning the other children off was doing the wrong thing but both you and your wife could have avoided this scenario entirely. Let them snack in the car! Crisps/ chips; crackers; rice cakes would have been perfect and needed minimal clean up", "YTA. Who takes a road trip and doesn\u2019t plan for traffic. I live in the city, and I always have water and snacks for my grandkids in my car.

This isn\u2019t about \u201cwait for 15 minutes\u201d; this is wait for more than 4 HOURS!! \n\nI always bring snacks for my little ones (4F 2F). A 2 hour ride would mean a bag full of snacks.

Sophie had already been waiting 4 hours for food.", "Let me just say that when you take a road trip for any extended period of time - and I think 2 hours is pretty long - you should prepare for the journey. That means having extra food, blankets, water, etc. What would have happened if you were stuck on the road with a flat tire or if the car broke down? Yes kids make messes in the car but two hours without a snack is pretty unfair. Sounds like you love your car more than the kids.\n\nNow to the brother. Why is he paying for the special school? How hard would it have been to give her a couple of goldfish crackers and say you\u2019ll be back. I understand that the other children are small, but even you said she couldn\u2019t help herself due to blindness. Your brother gave her snacks which you felt was not needed at that time. Fifteen minutes is a really long time for a really hungry child.", "NTA - weird than so many seem to think not feeding a kid for 2 hours is so inacceptable. \n\nNo child (except for medical reasons) can\u2019t handle 2 or 3 hours without food. Water however should always be accessible. And food shouldn\u2019t be used to shut up bored underage. \nBtw over feeding a kid to keep them quiet is a form of abuse so often overlooked. \n\nPriority are cleaning the kids who pooped themselves. Unless there an other emergency higher than risking poop everywhere and littles one marinating in literal feces, this is top priority.  \nIt might not be fun waiting for you to be done cleaning the kids, however it isn\u2019t a punishment. \n\nBIL seem really out to paint you as the awful step dad. Did you had a talk with your daughter about what she think of his comments? Did you cleared with her if she might feel any of those accusations may feel true? Did you discussed with her what you could you do differently or explaining why it happens this way, that it isn\u2019t her not being a priority, but sometimes the helpless youngsters. You must show her she can talk/express herself, and she is respected as a person.", "ESH. Andrew over reacted and wouldn\u2019t let it go. You should be able to workout the logistics of a car trip so that this situation wouldn\u2019t have happened at all due to having some snacks. Heck, even by simply pulling over at a stop, and getting the kid some snacks while changing the little ones would have worked and prevented a mess in the car.", "NTA. BIL needs to sit down and stfu. If a kid doesn\u2019t eat for a few hours it\u2019s not the end of the world, good lord. If you can\u2019t go two hours without needing to fill your face you\u2019re privileged af. No wonder so many people have unhealthy relationships with food. Snacks aren\u2019t a bad idea to have around for just such an occasion (ie a two hour trip becoming a four hour trip), but turning you into some negligent parent is over the top child-worshipping at its finest. You made a slight mistake, if that, just plan a little better next time.", "Esh\n\nIn the moment, you prioritized correctly. Your kid was literally covered in shit and that comes first.\n\nHowever, you set out for a long car ride (even if it was only 2 hr) with no snacks for three children? That was dumb", "Ah common, 3-4 hours of ripening in a diaper isn't that bad....\n\nLike seriously... No snacks and no reststops for 2 hours. That is just asking for trouble.", "A 10 year old that had to wait 4 hours and is practically helpless in an environment she doesn't know gets the right to complain.\n\nAnd lets be honest here, it wasn't 15 minutes. Arrival, grabbing stuff from the car, getting stuff ready changing / feeding the other kids, etc... It took more than 30 minutes of the eldest child sitting where they left her.\n\nAnyone of any age gets to complain at that point\n\nIt's not hard to grab an apple/ bread from a kitchen counter while dragging your toddler through a house.", "When you have kids you have to understand they\u2019re going to need to eat in the car, it\u2019s absurd to try and never feed them if they\u2019re in the car.

Poor kids will probably end up with diaper rash.", "Oh, the 10yo is fine for complaining, no argument. OP and wife owe her an apology for screwing this up, and a nice weekend doing something she likes. BIL is the one who\u2019s out of line. \n\nBut making her wait until the smaller ones were dealt with isn\u2019t harming her, nor is it a sign of neglect. Dealing with two soiled diapers first is a reasonable priority, because a 10yo can actually understand, \u201ePlease wait a moment, we\u2019ll we right with you.\u201c", "I think this person meant \"come on\" (I have a friend who always writes \"common\" when she means \"come on\" and it drives me nuts lol)", "Bullshit. It wasn't the waiting, it was the lack of forethought or planning for their children during a 4 hour drive that makes this an ESH. \n\nYou're telling me that during a 4 hour drive, they never pulled over to change their kids. They valued their car's cleanliness over the comfort of their children.\n\nI've taken hundreds of road trips. I value a clean car. I understand that during road trips, I have to sacrifice that clean car for a few hours in order to make sure that I'm comfortable.", "JFC. They didn't pack a sandwich and now you're deeming OP actions as dangerous and untrustworthy? And what about the Mum? Because it's her child and she also didn't pack a sandwich. But crazy Uncle Andrew isn't angry at her, even though she also chose to prioritise a dirty nappy. \n\nWhat Uncle Andrew is doing is parental alienation. Even IF it's true, it's toxic for him to be saying this to the child herself. If something is wrong with OP, then he should be bringing this up with his sister and/or the authorities depending on the severity of the situation. \n\nUncle Andrew is TA. OP and his wife are at best guilty of not planning ahead."]}
