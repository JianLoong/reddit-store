Always be prepared for the unexpected and you had a mess in the car and it would have reeked more from the poop than what snacks would have done.  Bring snacks that crumbs are easily wiped away with a hand like pretzels or gold fish.  I don't even go on trips over an hour or more with out snacks.  Also you have kids, that equals prepare for the possible mess and clean it up like an adult.  I don't have kids but when ever I take my nephews on trips guess what I presume there is going to be a mess in my back seat and make sure they have snacks that can be cleaned up easily.  And get this, at the end if my trip if there is a mess I clean my car and you won't believe this, it's clean once more.

Some of these comments are comical. I\u2019m going to give you the benefit of the doubt because I have crazy in laws and I\u2019m a step mom for 11 years now. Our oldest (my step son) was the first grandchild born and his biomom is MIA (she was abusive and struggles with addiction). Because of this he has always gotten a free pass and they were over protective A H\u2019s. Unfortunately always giving him a free pass, it led to behavior problems and addiction problems too.  By the time they realized that they were part of the problem, getting our oldest help was extremely hard. I came into his life at 14, once he turned 18 he could decline help and treatment. I\u2019m assuming the kids ate before you left and the diaper blow outs were at the end of your drive?  Your wife should have spoken up.  Her brother sounds like he has a problem because you\u2019re essentially \u201cthe man\u201d in the picture now.  You really need to talk to your wife about this.

Leber congenital amaurosis, a recessive gene disease? Andrew is paying for a nice school. And you don't know who is the bio dad. Does someone else know who the biological dad is?

You forgot snacks? I usually didn\u2019t carry snacks around for my kids. They weren\u2019t starved by any stretch of the imagination either. If we had just had lunch and it was a couple of hours drive, then I would have been more concerned about someone wanting to pee than snacks. (I should also add that my kids didn\u2019t snack much at home either, but there was always something around if they were hungry.) Asking a child to wait while two children who are unable to clean themselves up isn\u2019t inept or neglectful parenting. If you have more than one child, you are going to run into times when everyone needs something at the same time & you have to prioritize things. It sucks, but it is a reality. Could OP have given Sophie something quick without making a sandwich? Probably. Sophie also wasn\u2019t going to starve to death in that short amount of time. I wouldn\u2019t have made a sandwich if pizza was on the way. \n\nThe fight happened while the grand parents were out, but were they there when OP and family arrived? One of them could have helped Sophie get a bite, or helped with one of the little ones. Why was the wife not on the aSShOLe wagon with OP? She should have stood up for the joint parenting choice that happened. \n\nYep, different choices could have been made, but I don\u2019t think what happen deserved being harassed all night by the BIL, and absolutely he shouldn\u2019t have been singled out for what happened when his wife was there too.", "This! \n\nAnd who doesn't find somewhere to pull over to change two messy children in diapers?", "We were stuck on the highway. There were no stores nearby where one could buy food.\nI know I'm biased, but this kind of occasion rarely happens. I admit it was a mistake not bringing a snack with us. But it wasn't a 12 hours trip either.\nWe made this journey one thousand times in the past, and this was the first time it took more than 2 hours.", ">Also, is the special private school BIL pays for one that is better equipped to aid students with disabilities?\n\nYes. I'm not complaining about that. The public schools here are horrible, and would be specially horrible for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>does Sophie often take a back seat to her half siblings?\n\nNo. I swear I try my best to treat her as my own.", "Yep! Goldfish. Cutie oranges. String cheese. Nuts. So many options. I\u2019m surprised the 8mo kept it together that long. They even make these cool squeeze holders & snack holders to prevent messes. Not to mention bibs. \n\nI agree Good & responsible parents always have snacks & water.", "We were stuck on the highway. Plus, it was 36\u00b0C outside. And we were surrounded by cars.\nIf we had brought a snack, the kids would have eaten inside. We didn't bring something because we believed the trip wouldn't be long.", "My in-laws were out buying food when we arrived. They were also taking care of other things along the day, and only got home after the argument.", " In dubio pro reo. I totally would believe that the bigger brother is protective over his sisters child that she got at a young age, especially when the father was a dick and he had to assume a father-ish role. \n\nThere doesn\u2019t have to be incest involved for a recessive gene disease to manifest.", "And has there never been other occasions that would lead Andrew to worry that Sophie isn\u2019t getting her needs met?", "You know what, I had a rule of no eating too. Before becoming a parent. \n\nOnce you\u2019re a parent your children comes first. \n\nAdditionally it is NOT THAT HARD to clean your car.\n\nI was pretty OCD with but now as a parent I just remove the car seat regularly and vacuum and wash the linings. I would never think to refuse food to my child just because I hate crumbs in my car. This is ridiculous.", "YTA. 3 kids on a road trip alway pack snacks. Saves you money and accept you will need to vacuum the car when you get home. However for drinks only pack water. Split chocolate milk is a nightmare that just giving.", "Yes. Maybe I am totally wrong. But the way OP wrote it like he doesn't trust what his wife and brother-in-law told him.\n\n>PS: Sophie's dad was kept out of the picture because he wasn't (let's   \nsay) a good person. At least, that's what Hailey and Andrew told me.

Why doesn\u2019t he like you?", "He always had a close relationship with Hailey, even after our marriage, so I suppose he's jealous.\nHe never liked Sophie's dad (rightfully). So maybe he's afraid I will inevitably turn out like him.\n\nKids are very naive. They can believe almost anything a trusted adult tells them if he repeats it multiple times. Andrew used to tell Sophie on various occasions that I was dangerous and not trustworthy.", "It doesn't help when your actions seem to line up with what's being told. They are naive and every adult not helping with her needs at that moment but everyone else's, with that being naive thing, makes them connect dots that maybe aren't there... \n\nShe trusted that you guys in a strange environment where she's basically helpless to care for herself, would do it. You didn't. The naive child would connect some dots there when being told your not trustworthy...", "INFO: why is Andrew only mad at you?

A ten year old is quite capable of waiting a few minutes to get what she wants. If the uncle had walked in to find her passed out from low blood sugar and several pounds underweight, then he could be this upset. Sophie's disability is her eyes. Coddling her will make that disability spread throughout her attitude and personality and make her insufferable to be around. Like her uncle!!!!", "Info: how much does it takes you to make a sandwich?", "YTA\u2026.you took three children on a two hour car ride with no snacks?   There are ways to deal with messy kids on car rides.  Trash bags in the car, a sheet to protect the seat, etc.  then says car ride took four hours?!   And then you expect a ten year old blind child to sit on a sofa in a home she is unfamiliar with?!  While you and your wife attend to the little ones?   You seriously could not take two minutes to grab her a snack?  Stop at a drive thru?  Your young ones already needed changing.  Two more minutes was not going to hurt them.  And you cannot tell me it would have only been ten minutes until you hit Sophie some food.  You and your wife sound horrible.", "ESH. It sounds like a mess all round, but you should always bring snacks on a trip with kids, no matter how long. What's the worst that could happen? You got some crumbs in the car maybe? Is it really that big a deal?", "I\u2019m not going to judge here, what I am going to say is if you\u2019re worried about your car being dirty you should be more creative on how to keep it clean. Try putting a plastic tarp on the floor to catch crumbs, buy seat covers (they sell ones that go under car seats). Even if the trip was only supposed to be 2 hours you should\u2019ve had snacks. Apple slices or cuties would be good because they don\u2019t have crumbs and are pretty easy to pick up. I HATE my car being dirty but I would rather clean it than let my 18mo be hungry. I ALWAYS have snacks in his backpack so he can eat as he wants to eat. Even at worst if you had just packed a few sandwiches and snacks you could\u2019ve handed them out as soon as you got to your destination and that would\u2019ve given you a break from cranky children.", "Info- what time did the car ride start? What are the kids meal times?", "Agree with the snacks part - you don\u2019t plan a drive with small kids and not bring something for them to munch on. \n\nBut a 10yo can wait 15 minutes for her food while a baby and a toddler are cleaned of poop. The priority OP and his wife set here were perfectly fine. They should have planned better, yes. But BIL was way out of line.", "I was thinking too much of the scenario op described but you're right. They could have easily stopped for food as that became a problem or brought snacks.", "it\u2019s really not. i don\u2019t understand the strong reactions here. i\u2019ve raised 8 kids and it\u2019s always a juggling act of prioritizing the most pressing needs. sure, bringing snacks would have been a good idea. but shit happens. in this case, literally. i think it\u2019s safe to assume Sophie had eaten that day and wasn\u2019t being starved. four hours between meals is pretty normal.", "She didn\u2019t wait just 15 minutes though. She was stuck in the car for 4 hours prior to that.", "Especially when traffic isn\u2019t moving.", "It doesn't matter. When you go on a trip with your kids, you pack supplies just in case. This is day one shit.", "Just bring snacks. It\u2019s not hard to bring food and water in a car. I don\u2019t understand your thinking here at all.\n\nI don\u2019t believe that there were no exits you could get off in a four hour traffic jam to get food.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t make kids sit in filthy diapers for hours.", "And while that's a great Plan A, not bringing snacks just in case was foolish. You could have prevented this entire situation with basic foresight.", "Next time just pack some fruit and sandwiches even on 1 hour rides.\n\n\nYta for being so defensive about a mistake you made."]}
