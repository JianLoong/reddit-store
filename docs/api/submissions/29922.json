{"id": 29922, "submission_id": "17jb1mo", "title": "AITA for expecting my fianc\u00e9\u2019s ex-wife to contribute more towards their kids\u2019 expenses?", "selftext": "\nMy fianc\u00e9 (42M)  and I (32F) share custody of his kids 50-50 with his ex-wife (42F) and her husband (45M). Until this year, mainly due to his higher income, my fianc\u00e9 covered all the kids' expenses, irrespective of where they were staying. However, with our upcoming wedding and new house purchase, we felt it was time to split the costs 50-50, to which she agreed. Generally, she covers their food when they're with her and we do the same, while miscellaneous expenses are shared equally.\n\nA few months ago, when one of the kids lost her phone, the ex-wife said she couldn't afford a replacement, so we covered it. It's worth noting that the ex-wife and her husband lead a comfortable lifestyle, taking at least two vacations a year and owning a spacious and expensive apartment. Yet, for substantial kids' expenses like trips, it seems we usually foot the bill.\n\nRecently, a situation arose: one of the kids needed a winter jacket. She told my fianc\u00e9 she could only afford a second-hand one. While we were shopping, the kid casually mentioned a $1,500 jacket, saying that his mom and stepdad had recently bought identical ones for themselves. My fianc\u00e9 was understandably upset. It seemed unfair that she was unwilling to contribute any money for her kid's jacket but could spend $1,500 on one for herself. She responded that she had asked her sister for the money to buy the jacket. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\n\nRegardless of her justification, I believe she should contribute proportionally for the kids. We bought a $500 jacket and asked her to cover $150-$200. She declined, offering only $50, and accused us of being unreasonable.\n\nAITA for wanting her to contribute fairly?\n\nEdit: I want to clarify that there's nothing wrong with second-hand shopping. However, the way she approached it implied that we should purchase a new winter jacket for the kid. In addition, the kid rarely shops throughout the year and isn't fond of second-hand shopping, unlike his brother who enjoys it. She conveyed that to meet his preferences, second-hand wasn't an option. We didn't confront her about her recent pricey purchase. Instead, we just mentioned, \"We bought a $500 jacket, could you contribute $150-$200?\" She responded that she could only give $50. That's when my fianc\u00e9 brought up her $1500 jacket, to which she claimed her sister had funded it and that she also occasionally splurges on herself.\n\nUpdate: \nI need to clarify a few things. First and foremost, I pride myself on being a dedicated step-mother (official or not), so much so that the children often come to me for assistance, a fact I cherish deeply. Up until now, I've intentionally stayed out of any financial or decision-making discussions involving them, but it's not as straightforward as many assume. For context, while the children's mother's new spouse actively participates in their meetings, I've refrained from doing so. Not because of a lack of interest, but rather, I didn\u2019t desire weekly meetings. It was only this year that I began contributing to decisions. Families are intricate and unique in their dynamics. So now the $500 jacket. We reside in one of Europe's coldest and costly regions. Given our teenager's minimal purchases, we wanted to ensure he had the warmest, top-quality coat. This wasn\u2019t about the cost itself, but the principle and previous agreements. While the ex-wife acknowledged the price was fair, she stated her inability to pitch in more. We've always kept such discussions away from the children. Some insinuate that step-parenting is a peripheral role, but in reality, it's deeply immersive. The extent of involvement often hinges on the dynamic established between the biological parents, irrespective of legal dictates. \n\nThis Reddit post was intended to seek other opinions, not to encourage pettiness (as some people assumed that was why I was here). I plan to advise my fianc\u00e9 to have an extended discussion about their roles and what they expect from each other regarding contributions, and then decide on the next steps. Thank you all!
