{"id": 29922, "submission_id": "17jb1mo", "title": "AITA for expecting my fianc\u00e9\u2019s ex-wife to contribute more towards their kids\u2019 expenses?", "selftext": "\nMy fianc\u00e9 (42M)  and I (32F) share custody of his kids 50-50 with his ex-wife (42F) and her husband (45M). Until this year, mainly due to his higher income, my fianc\u00e9 covered all the kids' expenses, irrespective of where they were staying. However, with our upcoming wedding and new house purchase, we felt it was time to split the costs 50-50, to which she agreed. Generally, she covers their food when they're with her and we do the same, while miscellaneous expenses are shared equally.\n\nA few months ago, when one of the kids lost her phone, the ex-wife said she couldn't afford a replacement, so we covered it. It's worth noting that the ex-wife and her husband lead a comfortable lifestyle, taking at least two vacations a year and owning a spacious and expensive apartment. Yet, for substantial kids' expenses like trips, it seems we usually foot the bill.\n\nRecently, a situation arose: one of the kids needed a winter jacket. She told my fianc\u00e9 she could only afford a second-hand one. While we were shopping, the kid casually mentioned a $1,500 jacket, saying that his mom and stepdad had recently bought identical ones for themselves. My fianc\u00e9 was understandably upset. It seemed unfair that she was unwilling to contribute any money for her kid's jacket but could spend $1,500 on one for herself. She responded that she had asked her sister for the money to buy the jacket. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\n\nRegardless of her justification, I believe she should contribute proportionally for the kids. We bought a $500 jacket and asked her to cover $150-$200. She declined, offering only $50, and accused us of being unreasonable.\n\nAITA for wanting her to contribute fairly?\n\nEdit: I want to clarify that there's nothing wrong with second-hand shopping. However, the way she approached it implied that we should purchase a new winter jacket for the kid. In addition, the kid rarely shops throughout the year and isn't fond of second-hand shopping, unlike his brother who enjoys it. She conveyed that to meet his preferences, second-hand wasn't an option. We didn't confront her about her recent pricey purchase. Instead, we just mentioned, \"We bought a $500 jacket, could you contribute $150-$200?\" She responded that she could only give $50. That's when my fianc\u00e9 brought up her $1500 jacket, to which she claimed her sister had funded it and that she also occasionally splurges on herself.", "created_utc": 1698609167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jb1mo/aita_for_expecting_my_fianc\u00e9s_exwife_to/", "score": 534, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That includes questions about whether you want a joint account, how much each of you should pay into that joint account, and what that joint account would cover.\n\nIt might make sense for you and your husband-to-be to each have at least some personal, non-joint money.

A good coat is at least 200$ and more.", "A teenager in adult sizes in a cold place definitely could use a jacket that's more than $50 new.\n\n$500 is a wee bit extreme, and secondhand or outlets are great options. But a couple hundred for a good quality coat can be very worth it.", "In this economy? Try their 40s.", "My parents court agreement was my mom paid child support as long as we were in college or turned 18.  I dropped out of college at 19 and my child support ceased, even though I was living at my dads and working a crap job at the time (so my dad was still supporting me).", "Yes, exactly.", "I disagree. She's an adult she's going to look after her things a lot better than a child, and it will last her for a few years. I honestly doubt that any child is gonna know the difference between a $500 jacket vs. a lower priced jacket", "Children grow out of things. Adults dont. \n\nAnd if they thought that was unreasonable they should have negotiated, they had no right to just decide. She offered $50, thats half of a reasonably priced coat.", "This is the point. Its not like they dont have money to spend. She just isnt willing to spend it on her child.", "$50 *is* half of a reasonable cost. The part about she can't just pay half for something that isn't available becomes completely moot when they just decided without her input. It is completely reasonable in that situation for her to just say \"no, I'm giving you what I origionally planned to spend\".", "Thats a case by case. I didnt stop growing till I was in my  early 20s. I graduated HS at 180 and grew to 185 by  the time I was done college.\n\nMy case is extreme, but its not uncommon for people to grow when they are in their late teens.", "I have a 20-year-old that we're not sure is done.", "Even if it fits now the kid is likely to bulk up a bit in the next few years.

Another daughter didn\u2019t stop until she was 14.

I never had a super expensive coat, but it wasn't a cheap one. You always still had to wear layers under it.\n\nMy point was that some coats (especially for adults), are worth it to spend $500, but certainly not for kids", "There are huge chunks of North America that are consistently colder than the arctic for a lot of the winter. Being near the ocean tends to moderate temperatures so if you're near the center of the continent but also relatively far north, it gets really cold (think parts Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Illinois and parts of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario).\n\nIt's also not walking time that you need to worry about so much as it's stationary time. Like, you worry more if your kid is waiting for the bus than going on a hike", "Oh I totally agree. There's no way I'd buy a coat like that for a child. There's a great secondhand market for coats anyway.", "Your weather sounds similar to ours then. It's rough up here. \ud83d\ude02 Just got our first snowstorm. It's the wind that really hurts. Having good gloves/hat/scarf is essential or you're just letting the heat out.", "bullshit... you can get -40 degree weather gloves on Amazon under$20", "Well to be fair if they really were in sweden and using a rough dollar conversion, that would explain it. That is an expensive country", "Depending on the age of the kid, you may not want to shell out $150 on a winter coat every couple of years. I was wearing adult sizes by the time I was in grade six (my mom made the mistake of buying new clothes in August one year and by the time September came around, I had grown out of them).  I remember wearing ladies sized shoes by the time I was in middle school.\n\nBut then I live in the PNW near Seattle and we usually have one big snowfall a year so most kids probably have a some sort of warmer coat but most just wear a warmer hoodie; not like we need parkas at the coast.", "You expect him to stop spending money on his kids when it stops being court mandated? If not, and I hope not, how is this relevant. OPs husband is clearly actually involved with his kids", "A 14 year old who may be in adult sizes can take good care of a coat that can last years.   Who says the ex won't throw the $1500 jacket over for the next trend?", "Adults definitely get fat and \"grow\" out of things.  Those parents aren't wearing that brand when it's no longer trendy I am betting.   Still no adult needs a $1500 coat but only offers second hand for a child.  $50 for a child after 3k for them, ugh no.", "It just makes her look bad because shes only willing to pay around 2% of what she spends on herself and her husband on her child.", "Meanwhile I stopped growing at 13, unless we count boobs. Kept hoping I'd have a sudden growth spurt all through my teens but nah. I'll forever be 3 inches shorter than my mother dammit.", "Yeah agree here, when I started highschool I was at 158cm and ended up at 173cm in my graduating year. Plenty of people did stop growing but I just kept going up lol my stupid feet went from a size 9 to 11 during that time as well. It really is just a case by case basis", "My mom had a friend who grew three inches after she gave birth!", "Same, I grew a good 3 inches AFTER I graduated high school!", "My brother grew 2\u201d between 19 and 22.", "Same here. 5\u20195\u201d senior year, 5\u20198\u201d at 21.", "Growth spurts into the early 20s are also common in my family.

You clearly have never lived in Alaska, so quit your BS.", "No, you can get gloves that claim they're rated for -40 on Amazon for $20. \n\nThose are not the same as getting gloves that are actually durable, reliably waterproof and comfortably warm at -40.", "Not ones that are worth buying if you have the money to pay for a better pair. Gloves that last are very worth it.", "They said in an old comment that they were in either Belgium or Sweden and the latter makes more sense to me.", "It\u2019s relevant because sometimes that how it happens\u2026?  You literally talked about expenses not ending at 18, but sometimes child support does.  If they\u2019re already complaining about money, it could very much happen.", "I mean, true, they could, but I highly doubt it mistakes happen and cloths get ruined.

People do wear the same clothes for years.", "It doesn't make her look bad. It makes them look bad for creating the situation.\n\nBuying much cheaper clothes for children than yourself is the norm.

Everything was really high up and often required me climbing on counters. Thank god for my freakishly long arms. I stayed at my dads during covid and was like goddamn it as I in my mid 30s hoisted myself up on counters again to get something.", "I feel your pain! And at 10 years old my stepdaughter is already taller than me. Her favourite thing right now is pointing that fact out lmao", "Yeah, I stopped in 5th.

That's half of a $100 coat.", "Uh... maybe we come from two different cultures or something. Buying cheaper clothes for kids is normal, but it should still be proportional to what you are buying for yourself and your living standard.\n\nBut everyone has different values.

That's bad parenting and something people would talk mad shit on you for. It's stupidly wasteful everyone will think you are pathetically trying to signal and it's setting a bad example for them.\n\nAs long as the clothes are good enough quality to last until the kid outgrows them they are not to cheap.  Your kid shouldn't be in something that actually looks bad, and they shouldn't be in something that is scruffy. They do not need anything more than that. A decent Tshirt might cost \u00a320. That \u00a320 tshirt is good for the parent who is spending \u00a320 on their own shirts, and the parent who is spending \u00a31000 on their own shirts.\n\nSomeone buying their kid a \u00a3100 shirt they will grow out of in a year because they think it should be proportional to what they spend on themselves, is just wasting money and will be heavily judged"]}
