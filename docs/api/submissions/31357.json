No, seriously. How exactly did you think she would manage to leave two young children at home while she went off to your childfree Thanksgiving? And why would you ever think she would *want* to do that? \n\n>>Why can't everyone else still come? \n\nBecause the rest of your family clearly likes your sister and her children more than they like you and would rather spend their holiday around them. Which, based on how you're coming off in your OP and comments, is very understandable.", "WHAT THE FUCK IS SHE GONNA DO ON THANKSGIVING?????\n\nGet a babysitter????? Are you dense?", "What, pray tell, is the \u201cmagical figuring out\u201d? \n\nPotential babysitters may not be available, as it\u2019s also thanksgiving for them.\n\nIf they are, it may cost clientele possibly more than double than usual.\n\nYour stubborn rules don\u2019t sound like they\u2019re worth the money.", "Agreed! I'm not saying douse something in sauce without trying it, but people have different tastes.\n\n Just as it's ah behavior for a guest to yell, \"Can't you season this crap?!\" it is ah behavior for a host to expect everyone to love every dish served as is it were popeye's fried chicken.", "I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t think a grist Thanksgiving is important for her new baby to have with family\ud83d\ude44", "Fair.\nThen she turned around and burned OP to the ground socially with the family.

Like most times like a New Years party, Grandma would watch. She expects some teen to skip her family get together to watch them?", "And her parents would like to spend Thanksgiving with their grandchildren.", "Now I\u2019m outraged AND hungry.", "Especially considering his sister has a literal infant. \n\nA family holiday spent with *checks notes* family?

Definitely TA", "As someone that also has 3 siblings and age gaps, gonna bet OP pulled the \u201cI\u2019m the oldest card\u201d and still does to try to force people to do what he wants.

I could immediately picture what you were describing and realize your kids would probably be my favorite which made me laugh so hard I started coughing.", "I'm English so don't understand fully. But I assume a kid free thanksgiving would be similar to trying to force a kid free Christmas. It's a family holiday, you can't expect people to just ditch their kids when presumably they want to spend a family holiday as a family.", "How did she burn him to the ground? By telling her family that she couldn't come and the reason why? Nothing in the original post suggests she embellished anything.", "No actually, she didn\u2019t \u201cburn OP to the ground\u201d.
