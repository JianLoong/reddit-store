I am sure in your dorm you have blankets, pillows, and sheets. Bring them with you. Take responsibility for your own comfort. It's not anyone's responsibility but your own. It's your responsibility to know if they have extras for you to use. Whether it be your parents' house, grandparents' house, or anyone's house for that matter.\n\nMy mom's house has 4 bedrooms. My sister is in one, my nephew is 9 years old and blind in another, and my mom has a room. There is no bed in the 4th bedroom. When my fiance and I visit, we always stay overnight as we live over an hour away. I personally know my mom does not have a guest room, extra pillows, or any blankets or bed. So we bring what we need for comfort. Our own pillows, blankets, sheets, towels,  air mattress. I do not expect her to go out and buy these things to make sure I am comfortable.\n\nIf you're a broke college student and say you can't afford it either. Get a job! Simple. I went to college full time & worked a full-time job on top of a part-time work study job at my college when I was going to college. I'm not a highly motivated person. Pretty lazy, actually. I like to sit home and relax. I did what needed to be done. I prefer having a place to live, foos, internet, being at that time go out to the bars with friends. Grant it.

My kids are home from school right now, and I am always asking them if they're warm enough at night or if they need more blankets, etc. because I want them to be comfortable.

Do not accept someone to be accommodating just because you are cold or need something. When they may only have little if anything to provide to you. This is crap on so many levels. \n\nOP is an adult. Even if a poor college student. It's time to grow up and get a job while going to school.

In hindsight, I get that the house was huge. I get that turning up the heat was phenomenally expensive and didn't actually do much to heat up specific places. But also in hindsight? My parents had fucking options they could have presented when I was crying from misery, and chose not to. They could have looked into space heaters, more blankets, some carpets, anything. At the time I was too young to know about some of these or understand you could... Walk into a store and buy things. Money was never a problem, believing my discomfort was an action item was the problem. And I think op is in the same place.

There's a lot of times when my fiance and I don't agree on temperatures, and we live together. We try and accommodate each other if he's too cold and I am too hot. The thermostat goes up. I remove layers of clothes that I almost always have 2 layers on. If I am cold at someone's house, I do expect them to turn up their thermostat. I come prepared always.

Any good parent would do this!!", "Thank you for validating this. Sure, the parents might not be able to afford jumping up, buying more bedding and air mattresses and heaters etc, but...

I am an adult. I can take care of my own needs. However, when my family talks to me, I expect kindness, no rudeness, and polite behavior. When you assume, even family should take care of your basic needs, and they fall through. People tend to get hurt. Personal experience for me is to look out for myself, my needs, my fiances.

And I imagine that when you bring your own blankets, you're not going to illogically insist that blankets aren't needed.
