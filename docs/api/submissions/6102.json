In Canada (at least my province) dorms are always open when students are living there. What if they are international or even travelled from another city? Its literally their living accomadations, during the break do they just shove them outside tell them to get a plane ticket home or freeze?", "Get a space heater? \n\nObviously going back to school is the best option, but if dorms are closed, OP has to tough it out and figure out alternate plans for Easter.", "This is what I was thinking too. Or even just have OP sleep on an air mattress in the brother\u2019s room. There must be some accommodations they can make for 2 weeks. It isn\u2019t that long of a time to change things up a little.", "Lol, he\u2019s not asking her to give up her bed. Read a little closer.", "In Ontario I know that they shut the dorms down completely.", "Granted, but as a grown man I\u2019m not going to sit around, be cold and complain to Reddit", "So the brown man should be cold and pout?", "How is that relevant? 4 year old lives there full time where OP doesn't.", "That makes you a bigger AH", "Thats actually wild they pay all that money for living accomodations and can\u2019t use them. Sounds liek it should be illegal \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d", "4 years old shouldn\u2019t make the law in their parents law. If you pay a rent you can have a word to say.", "They tell students to go to hotels or go on vacation. Some residences will have a grad apartment the international students may be offered to rent for two weeks assuming there is vacancy. Otherwise, tough luck. Most international students don\u2019t care because they all came with money anyways. They\u2019ll end up visiting Banff or Niagara Falls or something.", "My campus had a combined \u201cnon-trad\u201d 23 y/o+ slash international dorm that was open for spring and winter breaks but closed for the summer."]}
