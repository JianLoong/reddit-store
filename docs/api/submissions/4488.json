She said that all of her friends had pools and she was the only one who didn\u2019t have one, plus she loved swimming. She insisted that she would use it daily in the summer. \n\nMy husband and I could afford one, but as I\u2019m sure some of you know, pools are very expensive and neither of us really like swimming so we wanted my daughter to understand the cost she was asking for. We made an agreement that we would install a pool but that once she was old enough to start working, she would pay us back for half of it. She quickly agreed. \n\nWell, flash forward to now. She\u2019s 16 and just got her first job, and now she wants to save up for a prom dress she really likes. I reminded her of our agreement about the pool and she no longer wants to uphold her end of the agreement. I insisted, threatening to take away phone and car privileges if she doesn\u2019t pay her father and I back.\n\nNow, she won\u2019t speak to me. My husband is agreeing with her, saying that we can\u2019t have honestly expected a twelve year old to keep her end of the agreement. For me, this isn\u2019t even about money \u2014 it\u2019s about teaching my young daughter the right morals to live life with. I don\u2019t want her to think she can just go around making deals for her benefit and then just not upholding them.

Giving you her hard earned cash for a pool that sits on YOUR property and that YOU will ultimately financially benefit from, is not teaching her morals.

The arrangement was unreasonable and unrealistic. And YOU are the one who should have realized that from the beginning.

This example is so bad there are certainly lots of others.  Time to start acting like a parent:\n\n* She doesn't always get what she wants.

She needs that.\n* You're going to have to fess up to a screwup when she was 12.  You need to tell her that you didn't handle it well and you're not going to hold her to half the pool.

But don't get into anything you can't follow through on.", "YTA She was 12.  That\u2019s not realistic.  You are not 12.  You should have realized that.  The pool is for everyone and you own it, not her.  You could have just said that if all of her friends had one, she didn\u2019t really need it.  No one lets a 12 year old make decisions like this.

She had no concept of how much money that was, or how much work she would need to do to pay for it. \n\nHowever, since you felt it was fine to exploit your 12 child and wanted your daughter to pay thousands of dollars, you should have started making her pay it off by helping out with chores or putting a portion of her allowance (if she got one) toward her half starting when she was 12. Waiting four years later is ridiculous. No one takes out a loan and has to start paying it back four years later. That\u2019s not how the loan process works. You take out a loan, you\u2019re expected to make payments immediately within a month to 45 days after taking it out. Not 4 years later. You\u2019re not teaching her the lesson you think you are. She had no way to know what her financial situation would be or her other needs or responsibilities when she started earning an income.\nYou can\u2019t honestly blame her for not wanting to pay now for something she quickly and foolishly agreed to when she was an adolescent child. She was not mature enough nor did she have the proper brain development yet at that age to fully understand what she was agreeing to and the serious expense she was agreeing to. \n\nYou\u2019re worried about teaching her morals, but your lack of morals to exploit your child are going to be the biggest takeaway she\u2019ll have.", "by the way, did she use the pool like you hoped she would ?", "My daughter wouldn\u2019t have gotten a pool.

Come on now, you should know better and I don't buy you whole \"I wanna teach her a lesson\" story", "YTA. If she was an adult when you made this agreement I can see it being something to uphold, but she was literally 12 when she agreed to this. There is no way she fully understood what she was signing up for and how much work it can be to make literal thousands of dollars worth of money.

You made an agreement with a 12 year old to pay for half the cost of a pool you added to your home? Wow.

You entered into an agreement with a 12 y/o about a pool. She really wanted it and you should know that no matter what she would have said yes to any demand.

You're telling her that she should have to miss important milestones, put off buying anything for herself, and basically throw herself into slaving for this pool deal she made as a small child. \n\nI would go as far as to say what you did was manipulative. At 12 y/o she probably didn't even understand what the pool cost or comparatively how hard or how long she'd have to work to pay it off. Did you sit down and explain to your child that a pool installation costs typically in the tens of thousands of dollars? Why would you make a deal with a child to pay almost a year of tuition at some places for a swimming pool they wanted when they were 12?", "YTA.  A 12-year-old isn\u2019t capable of understanding the impact of an agreement like that, that\u2019s why they can\u2019t sign contracts.

She said that all of her friends had pools and she was the only one who didn\u2019t have one, plus she loved swimming. She insisted that she would use it daily in the summer. \n\nMy husband and I could afford one, but as I\u2019m sure some of you know, pools are very expensive and neither of us really like swimming so we wanted my daughter to understand the cost she was asking for. We made an agreement that we would install a pool but that once she was old enough to start working, she would pay us back for half of it. She quickly agreed. \n\nWell, flash forward to now. She\u2019s 16 and just got her first job, and now she wants to save up for a prom dress she really likes. I reminded her of our agreement about the pool and she no longer wants to uphold her end of the agreement. I insisted, threatening to take away phone and car privileges if she doesn\u2019t pay her father and I back.\n\nNow, she won\u2019t speak to me. My husband is agreeing with her, saying that we can\u2019t have honestly expected a twelve year old to keep her end of the agreement. For me, this isn\u2019t even about money \u2014 it\u2019s about teaching my young daughter the right morals to live life with. I don\u2019t want her to think she can just go around making deals for her benefit and then just not upholding them. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don't know the amount involved, but I'm gonna guess it's not a couple hundred. I feel like making a 16yo pay for who knows how long for an agreement she made at age 12 is predatory.\n\nBesides, the OP is also in the wrong for putting that much responsibility/fault in the shoulder of their kid.

It's because it is! She was 12(!!!) years old. She was a child, and still is! How was she supposed to \"treat money with respect\" if she wasn't able to truly understand the importance of money yet? Obviously learning to handle money and understand/uphold contracts is something everyone has to learn, but she was actively doing that - she got a job and wanted to buy a dress with her money. That's the first step in learning how to handle money at an appropriate age.

Building a very expensive pool they apparently don't even want because they \"don't swim\", but counting on their daughter paying back a few thousand dollars to finance it? What did she learn here? That she should have children early so that she can count on them working at a young age to finance her extravagant purchases as well? \n\nYou sound ridiculous.
