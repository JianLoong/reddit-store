I can understand why your family feels like it does. My family is from Colombia and we hate hearing when something bad happens there.  It is such a beautiful country.  Much like your mom's homeland.

You didn't lead them astray, you just couldn't help. Tough luck.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to help people who are being openly rude.", "NTA; that\u2019s horribly offensive and presumptive of them.

Years ago, some college friends and I stopped at a Greek pizza place. The Greek owner was rudely  speaking \"under his breath loudly\"  about the 5 of us young women in Greek.

Oh, because that is surely all a young girl in CA could be? Urgh. These people are the worst type of traveller: privileged, entitled and without compassion. \n\nThey are owed nothing from anyone and judging by their behaviour, they deserve nothing from anyone.

I knew only a limited amount of Russian and Spanish but could fully get what they were mumbling to the wait staff under their breath.  Totally rude, belittling and I was shocked.   While standing in line at the bar, one of the Russians was again getting agitated for his drink and mouthing off to his buddy.   Not skipping a heartbeat - I turned around, looked him straight in the eyes and told him off, to quit being disrespectful to these guys working behind and trying their best to make everyone happy.

She got pregnant and delivered there so my sister\u2019s birth certificate is in Spanish. At one time I asked if she could still speak the language fluently. She said no. In 2011 she went into a nursing home in Northern MN. As it so happened there was a Latino CNA-first generation here. My mom had forgotten our conversation probably 20-25 years before. After she  introduced us, he started talking to her in Spanish. Without missing a beat, she talked back to him damn near as fast as he was talking (she normally didn\u2019t talk that fast). Thankfully my jaw didn\u2019t hit the floor but it felt like it was going to. If that wasn\u2019t fluent Spanish on her part, I wonder what she was like when she first got back to the states. She actually spoke to my sister in Spanish before English.

Seriously let them feel both humiliated and guilty and remind them that the people trying to help them are PEOPLE.\n\nFun story.  I worked with a kid who was Hispanic but raised in the US so had an american accent while speaking English. Our dishwasher was Mexican and would constantly talk shit about him in Spanish. Constantly. Kid ignored it.  About 6 months in the dishwasher walked in on the kid speaking to the new line cook fluently in Spanish.
