A small yta for not shaming the tourists openly ;)", "NTA. Holy cow was I happy to read that tourists besides Canadians and Americans can be complete AHs.  I can understand why your family feels like it does. My family is from Colombia and we hate hearing when something bad happens there.  It is such a beautiful country.  Much like your mom's homeland.  Anyways those tourists brought whatever fate they recieved on themselves.  It sounds like you would have been willing to help until they insulted you and your cousins.", "NTA. I know the type. They come from the \u201cfirst world\u201d, they look down on Guatemalan people as less than, assume prostitution because of what your cousins were wearing in the warm weather, and they were probably drunk. Let them figure things out by themselves with all their superiority. Google maps exist. If you want human help and kindness, you need to earn it.", "NTA but you missed the opportunity to call them out for sure. it would have been wonderful.", "You should've given them the answer in German, and told them they should treat your people and country better, since they have such a poor history of doing so. \n\nOther than that NTA", "NTA. I speak English, Italian and Spanish fluently and I have been in similar situations (the kind where tourists were being rude and or demeaning of the locals).\n\nWhile I wouldn't have sent them to the local MS13 headquarters, and I would certainly have said something in German to them to make them rethink their life choices, you had no responsibility for their safety nor for their rudeness. You didn't lead them astray, you just couldn't help. Tough luck.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to help people who are being openly rude.", "NTA; that\u2019s horribly offensive and presumptive of them. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be going out of my way to assist anyone speaking ill of my family, however small the favor. Let them find their own way.", "NTA\n\nThey treated  you and your cousins poorly, thinking you didn't speak the language.", "I would have responded to them in German, asking them why they're in the country if they have no respect for the people - because I'm petty, and prone to call people out on being assholes.  NTA.  Just because they didn't know that you understood everything they were saying doesn't negate what they were *actually* saying.", "NTA.

And just to be clear a someone from Germany: We aren't all bad. I'm so embarassed on behalf of those shitty tourists.\n\nIf they get in danger / lost, it is on them. And some words can even be understand in different languages. Like many people know insults in many languages. I still know from my school time the not so nice word for prostitute in over ten languages. \n\nWhile yes, you get have a witty come back about, but afterwards we always have dreams about how quick-witted we reacted and yeah... reality is often not like this.", "YTA for not politely helping the tourists in German and making them die inside for what they said.", "NTA-But I would have sent them off in the wrong direction, possibly in to the rainforest, never to be heard from again.

At a bare minimum, OP should have spoken to them in German, so they could feel properly ashamed, but ideally, yes, correcting them on their disgusting assumption about OP's cousins would have been best.", "I was planning on helping until they called my little cousins prostitutes.", "This", "This would have been the more satisfying course of action imo, but NTA because this was also a reasonable way to handle it. It's not like OP sent them somewhere dangerous or made them worse off than they were before. They just refused to help, and that seems entirely justified.", "Might have been fun but I definitely would have gotten in real trouble if I sent them somewhere dangerous.", "A basic rule of foreign travel is: Don't assume the locals can't understand your language.

Years ago, some college friends and I stopped at a Greek pizza place. The Greek owner was rudely  speaking \"under his breath loudly\"  about the 5 of us young women in Greek. He didn't care that we could hear him. Unfortunately for him, one of my friends speaks fluent Greek because even though she is American, she was brought up in a culturally Greek family. It was wonderful seeing his face turn beet-red when she had a lovely chat with him in Greek as we were leaving.", "You should have said no and explained why in German.", "You could argue they put themselves at risk? \n\nBy being ill prepared and unable to navigate themselves out the situation. \n\nThen, a kindly local approaches and tries to assist and these assholes decide to\u2026 call his younger female cousins prostitutes. Oh, because that is surely all a young girl in CA could be? Urgh. These people are the worst type of traveller: privileged, entitled and without compassion. \n\nThey are owed nothing from anyone and judging by their behaviour, they deserve nothing from anyone. If they have a bad experience abroad, well that is too bad. Perhaps they should learn manners and to appreciate kindness. They could also practice being kind and decent people?", "NTA.

You should have told them exactly why you couldn't help them.", "How to annoy a German: let them wait for 15 minutes while having a good conversation with the cousins, laugh much! Then come back and tell them in German that you're very sorry but not even your family knows about the place despite being well informed and offer if you can help them with something different. Make sure to use Dativ correctly in your sentences xD\n\nI would love to witness this convo", "Funny - I did the same thing in Cuba while at a resort that had a lot of Russians staying that week.  I knew only a limited amount of Russian and Spanish but could fully get what they were mumbling to the wait staff under their breath.  Totally rude, belittling and I was shocked.   While standing in line at the bar, one of the Russians was again getting agitated for his drink and mouthing off to his buddy.   Not skipping a heartbeat - I turned around, looked him straight in the eyes and told him off, to quit being disrespectful to these guys working behind and trying their best to make everyone happy.   He just looked at me, stunned and never said another word.     It just pissed me off and I just had to say something. \n\nBTW OP - NTA.", "LOVE IT!!!", ">Apparently if anything happens to those tourists it will make their country look bad.

I would be making arrangements to leave and go home immediately. The tourists were lost, they weren't doing anything dangerous. NTA. \n\nI'm not going to call people out on that either. I know everyone thinks you should speak in German and shame them but I bet they wouldn't care. The type of people that act like this don't always have shame. Sounds like if you did call them out, you'd be blamed for upsetting tourists.", "NTA but you should have called them out since you are fluent in German.", "You're NTA for not helping them, but you should have called them out for their rudeness. You did ignore the insults by not addressing them.", "I gotta tell you a funny story to me about my mom speaking Spanish. She was stationed in Panama in 1974-75 with the military. She got pregnant and delivered there so my sister\u2019s birth certificate is in Spanish. At one time I asked if she could still speak the language fluently. She said no. In 2011 she went into a nursing home in Northern MN. As it so happened there was a Latino CNA-first generation here. My mom had forgotten our conversation probably 20-25 years before. After she  introduced us, he started talking to her in Spanish. Without missing a beat, she talked back to him damn near as fast as he was talking (she normally didn\u2019t talk that fast). Thankfully my jaw didn\u2019t hit the floor but it felt like it was going to. If that wasn\u2019t fluent Spanish on her part, I wonder what she was like when she first got back to the states. She actually spoke to my sister in Spanish before English. Unfortunately she didn\u2019t keep it up."]}
