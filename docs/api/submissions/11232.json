A small yta for not shaming the tourists openly ;)", "NTA. Holy cow was I happy to read that tourists besides Canadians and Americans can be complete AHs.  I can understand why your family feels like it does. My family is from Colombia and we hate hearing when something bad happens there.  It is such a beautiful country.  Much like your mom's homeland.  Anyways those tourists brought whatever fate they recieved on themselves.  It sounds like you would have been willing to help until they insulted you and your cousins.", "NTA. I know the type. They come from the \u201cfirst world\u201d, they look down on Guatemalan people as less than, assume prostitution because of what your cousins were wearing in the warm weather, and they were probably drunk. Let them figure things out by themselves with all their superiority. Google maps exist. If you want human help and kindness, you need to earn it.", "NTA but you missed the opportunity to call them out for sure. it would have been wonderful.", "You should've given them the answer in German, and told them they should treat your people and country better, since they have such a poor history of doing so. \n\nOther than that NTA", "NTA. I speak English, Italian and Spanish fluently and I have been in similar situations (the kind where tourists were being rude and or demeaning of the locals).\n\nWhile I wouldn't have sent them to the local MS13 headquarters, and I would certainly have said something in German to them to make them rethink their life choices, you had no responsibility for their safety nor for their rudeness. You didn't lead them astray, you just couldn't help. Tough luck.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to help people who are being openly rude.", "NTA; that\u2019s horribly offensive and presumptive of them. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be going out of my way to assist anyone speaking ill of my family, however small the favor. Let them find their own way.", "NTA\n\nThey treated  you and your cousins poorly, thinking you didn't speak the language.", "I would have responded to them in German, asking them why they're in the country if they have no respect for the people - because I'm petty, and prone to call people out on being assholes.  NTA.  Just because they didn't know that you understood everything they were saying doesn't negate what they were *actually* saying.", "NTA. Your reaction is understandable, although I would have helped them and let them know that I understand them and that they are rude and do not deserve to be helped.", "Also ich h\u00e4tte denen aber sowas von meine Meinung gegeigt. \n\nAber deutsche passive Agressivit\u00e4t ist halt auch sch\u00f6n.\n\nSo I would have given them something of my opinion.\n\nBut german passive aggressiveness is also nice.\n\nNTA", "NTA but I would have played this differently. I\u2019d have been as helpful as possible but done so in German.", "NTA I hate it when people think they can behave like AH just because they are on a vacation and nobody knows them. And just to be clear a someone from Germany: We aren't all bad. I'm so embarassed on behalf of those shitty tourists.\n\nIf they get in danger / lost, it is on them. And some words can even be understand in different languages. Like many people know insults in many languages. I still know from my school time the not so nice word for prostitute in over ten languages. \n\nWhile yes, you get have a witty come back about, but afterwards we always have dreams about how quick-witted we reacted and yeah... reality is often not like this.", "YTA for not politely helping the tourists in German and making them die inside for what they said.", "NTA-But I would have sent them off in the wrong direction, possibly in to the rainforest, never to be heard from again.
