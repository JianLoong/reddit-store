She thanked me for her gift, but I could tell she was disappointed. Afterwards, she found the label inside which says plus size.

She is only considered plus size in some designer brands, including mine but is still slender. The clothing we get for free is because it can't go to retail; loose thread, mislabelled, has a small stain (usually washes out), ex-runway or sample sizes.I only agreed to find her a dress as I have coworkers of a similar size to May that have found stuff, I wouldn't tell her I could find her something full well knowing I can't?

Also, OP stated in the comments that she didn\u2019t know the dress she was giving her was labeled \u201cplus sized\u201d\u2014 she simply got a dress that matched the measurements her niece got her. The fashion world is extremely harsh when it comes to sizing, and if the niece is determined to wear designer clothing, she needs to understand the reality of how they size without letting it affect her self-esteem. I agree that lesson is especially hard for a teenager to learn, and maybe there was a better way for OP to go about explaining it. She even admits she could have been more sensitive.

I would counter that not providing a clear explanation about why she wasn\u2019t able to find her size might do more harm than good, especially if the niece has seen how easy it is for OP to find clothing for herself. Not providing an explanation might allow the niece\u2019s imagination to run wild and to draw unrealistic conclusions. I think as a teenager I would have rather had someone explain to me clearly that these fashion labels tend to skew to extremely small sizes, that it\u2019s not at all a reflection on me and my size, but rather how effed up fashion and society writ large can be about body size. Every teenager is different though. I do agree that it sounds like OP could have been more sensitive, and I hope she learns from the experience and is more sensitive in the future. I\u2019m still voting NTA because I think her intentions were good, she still bought the niece a nice designer dress, and she mentioned in the comments that she didn\u2019t intentionally buy a plus-sized dress.
