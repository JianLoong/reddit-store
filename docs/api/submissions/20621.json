She is only considered plus size in some designer brands, including mine but is still slender. The clothing we get for free is because it can't go to retail; loose thread, mislabelled, has a small stain (usually washes out), ex-runway or sample sizes.I only agreed to find her a dress as I have coworkers of a similar size to May that have found stuff, I wouldn't tell her I could find her something full well knowing I can't?

It's not personal, it's just a sizing chart for their brand. \n\nThe inch measurements suck too, because those are sometimes the size, but not always, and you still have to check the sizing chart.", "Or cm\u2026 like the rest of the world outside of the US uses\u2026", "I think OP accidentally deleted a paragraph at the beginning and that's the last little bit left of \"the brand.\"", "Because she wanted us to know she wears an XXS and was manipulating readers to say she wasn\u2019t an asshole.", "I mean size 12 US is definitely plus size and if anything larger sizes are becoming more normalised not less\u2026 it definitely is not the case that below size US20/22 used to be considered straight sized. \n\nI don\u2019t disagree that sizing system is inconsistent but this is just factually incorrect.", "no company should have to be inclusive if someone fat wanted these clothes heres a crazy idea\n\n&#x200B;\n\neat less exercise more", "Right?? Who are these people?", "It doesn\u2019t sound like this girl is overweight. She hasn\u2019t said that she is.", "It sounds like she's actually not, but that this specific line runs small.", "Not in commerical clothing, but in some designer brands. She 'fits' a size we stock, but as the sizing runs small, it wouldn't fit her despite what our sizing chart says.  The clothing we get for free is because it can't go to retail; mislabelled, has a small stain (usually washes out), ex-runway or sample sizes. Even at my size, I have clothes labelled S or M. I have coworkers around May's size that have been able to find clothing for themselves. I never said I would buy her something from the line as it is very expensive, and you can get better quality clothes that are more affordable.", "I should clarify, you are not the asshole for explaining sizing to your niece, you didn't fat shame her. But you also didn't bother to get her what she wanted for her birthday because you didn't want to go outside the limited free sample sizes.", "I was a us size 10, walked into a boutique in Rome. The sales attendant took one look and said 'we have nothing that fits you'. I could have died.", "They were most likely the same \"size,\" vanity sizing has gone out of control since then", "I have clothes in every size from UK 6 to 14 that fit me, sizing is just ridiculous.", "It hurts my brain as well..  but I understand where they are coming from too.\n\n\n Many of the thin/petite Ladies are down right rude to anyone not in sizes near them. I can't tell you how often as a plus size person I have been made fun of by skinny people.\n\n But that is the same for anyone..  whether most people realize it or not they do discriminate against people that's not like them.\n\n it is a bad habit people in general need to break.", "This was a gift that was never going to end well then. Parents should have set more reasonable expectations if you work at a high end store.", "OP, you cut the beginning off from your post with your last edit. Maybe you want to put it back in again, the story gets kind of confusing without it.", "So you are saying a woman that wears a size 12 USA , who weighs  125-135 lbs, 5foot 9inch is plus size??!!?   \n\n You do realize that is why people have body issues.\n\n Nowadays it's considerate Plus size. \n\n back in the 90s in the early 2000s it was in the normal size of women's clothing", "Ok, then I think YTA. You must understand teens are sensitive about this sort of thing? You gave her something that says \u201cplus\u201d sized when you could have given her something else. You also brag about personally wearing an XXS which is no great feat these days and is also somewhat irrelevant.", "Imo this is the real problem with sizing: it is so inconsistent that the numbers have almost become meaningless. You can only compare between the same brand at the same time (because even the same brand changes their sizing over time)", "I have clothes that vary from kid's size (not even the bugger sizes) to L here, sizing can be weird. Only my pants are consistent sizes so far, and usually dresses as well (always XS or S). The rest is just a mess", "OP isn\u2019t \u201cbragging\u201d about being an XXS; she\u2019s just explaining that she\u2019s a different size than her niece, which is why it\u2019s easier for her to find designer clothing for herself than it would be to find it for someone of a different size. Also, OP stated in the comments that she didn\u2019t know the dress she was giving her was labeled \u201cplus sized\u201d\u2014 she simply got a dress that matched the measurements her niece got her. The fashion world is extremely harsh when it comes to sizing, and if the niece is determined to wear designer clothing, she needs to understand the reality of how they size without letting it affect her self-esteem. I agree that lesson is especially hard for a teenager to learn, and maybe there was a better way for OP to go about explaining it. She even admits she could have been more sensitive. Without more details about the specifics of how that conversation went, I\u2019m leaning NTA.\n\nETA: OP, I know this isn\u2019t an advice subreddit, but I just wanted to give you the heads up that even though you aren\u2019t in the wrong, it would be a good idea to be extra sensitive in how you discuss this issue moving forward. Maybe even pull her aside to have another conversation if you feel like you weren\u2019t sensitive the first time. I\u2019ve worked with teenagers with eating disorders, and something this seemingly \u201csmall\u201d can be a huge trigger, especially if they\u2019re already struggling with poor body image. Again, not your fault in the slightest if that\u2019s what\u2019s going on, but just something for you to be aware of and sensitive about in the future.", "What is the brand you\u2019re talking about? I can\u2019t find out what \u201che\u201d brand is", "The problem isn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t get her what she wanted. The problem is in how she told her she was too fat for the clothes and then gave her something labeled plus size. Her indications that her diminutive size is a source of pride only make her look worse.", "She did explain it. Damn", "Out of curiosity, how should OP have handled the situation then? To me, it sounds like she did the best she could given the circumstances, but I\u2019d like to know your perspective.", "She thinks she did.", "She could have told her that she wasn\u2019t able to grab anything good in her size, without the lecture about how massive she is in relation to designer clothing. She could have then given her something else in a straight size. Not hard.", "I totally get your point. I would counter that not providing a clear explanation about why she wasn\u2019t able to find her size might do more harm than good, especially if the niece has seen how easy it is for OP to find clothing for herself. Not providing an explanation might allow the niece\u2019s imagination to run wild and to draw unrealistic conclusions. I think as a teenager I would have rather had someone explain to me clearly that these fashion labels tend to skew to extremely small sizes, that it\u2019s not at all a reflection on me and my size, but rather how effed up fashion and society writ large can be about body size. Every teenager is different though. I do agree that it sounds like OP could have been more sensitive, and I hope she learns from the experience and is more sensitive in the future. I\u2019m still voting NTA because I think her intentions were good, she still bought the niece a nice designer dress, and she mentioned in the comments that she didn\u2019t intentionally buy a plus-sized dress. Sounds like you and I have similar perspectives, just different opinions on what judgment should be for OP.", "I\u2019m sure the niece is aware that she is bigger than OP. She may even be a foot taller for all we know.", "I\u2019m sure she\u2019s aware too. All the more reason for OP to be straight with her. If it\u2019s obvious that OP is several sizes smaller and OP decides to skate around the issue, it could make the niece even more insecure. (\u201cWhy won\u2019t my aunt be straight with me? Does she think there\u2019s something shameful about my size? If she does, what does everyone else think?\u201d)"]}
