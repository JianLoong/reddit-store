My company is not size inclusive anyway and the sample size items I pick from are usually XXS/XS, I have seen a few S items, but as the items are given to my whole company they are the ones that go first.\n\nMay gave me her measurements, a size which in my history of 8 years, I have seen twice in the sample sizes, but I go quite late as my size is usually left. I reminded May that the way we get clothing and its sizing tends to run small, and sometimes other departments see items first and also asked if she wanted anything else for her birthday but she only wanted a dress. I still asked my coworkers to keep an eye out for anything in May's size and went earlier ro get clothing, but I didn't see anything in her size. \n\nI got May a designer dress from a brand more affordable we also like in her size. She thanked me for her gift, but I could tell she was disappointed. Afterwards, she found the label inside which says plus size. My SIL has yelled at me for fat shaming a young girl and said I should be ashamed of myself, but in my eyes that is just a size and May's size is healthy for her height. \n\nI went over to see May and sat her down and explained our clothing sizes and the limitations of the samples, but it may have come across insensitive. She didn't say anything to me and left after.

It is not \"fat shaming\" to purchase an article of clothing in the size a person wears. Whether she likes it or not, that's the size she wears. \n\nSomeone needs to explain to your SIL what fat shaming actually is. Cause it's very clear she has no clue what it means.", "NTA - what were you supposed to do? Cut the label out of the clothes?", "NTA - It\u2019s a hard lesson to learn, but the fashion industry is fair or kind. Short of you buying her something expensive it\u2019s just a hard truth.", "NTA. I don't think you fat-shamed her based on your post. You didn't say \"If only you were thinner\" or acting like that, and you didn't made a judgement about her weight.\n\nPeople come in different shapes and sizes. There's nothing wrong with that. Your company's clothes don't fit her. End of story. \n\nIf we were talking about shoes and not a dress, this would have been a non-issue.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you did the best you could and when it was clear you weren't going to get the intended gift you went for the next on the list.\n\nHonestly this is why gifting clothes is so weird some time. They even provided you measurements which would raise the question of \"where they actually shocked by the size?\".\n\nMaybe you should have just provided them a gift card to your store? ;)", "NTA. How is any of this your fault? If that's what fits her, that's just how it is. Does she want you to lie or gift her a dress that doesn't fit?", "NTA. It\u2019s the fashion industry and you\u2019re getting free designer clothes. It\u2019s the fact that this industry makes sample designs at XXS & XS sizes. You did the best you could and got her a very nice design in her size. You did right and got her something nice in her size.", "INFO. There isn't enough here from the conversation with May. You've explained your intentions and perspective here, and you've summarized what was said, but not the actual words you used. *Were* you a little bit harsh? Did you maybe phrase things in a way that could have been taken wrong by an emotional teenager?\n\nI don't doubt your intentions here regardless, and I'm leaning toward NTA.", "NTA\nHer size is her size. If you gave her a dress that wasn\u2019t her size what would be the point?", "Nta. They don\u2019t have her size and there\u2019s nothing you can do about that. Doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re body shaming her. Coming from a plus size adult yes that plus size tag can seem hurtful at first because of all the hate towards bigger people but as she gets older she will hopefully realize the it\u2019s just some dumb tag and beauty doesn\u2019t come from your size. Bigger can be just as beautiful as skinnier. I hope you remind your niece that no matter what that tag says she\u2019s beautiful!", "YTA \n(not fully, though. I see where you were coming from)\n\nAt 16, especially being a girl, body image is so fragile. Since you're a part of a designer brand, it's probably hard not to notice the number of young girls who are affected by subtle comments about body sizes.\n\nIf you say her size was normal for her height, knew you couldn't get a dress she wanted, so you opted out for another brand you both liked(which i think is perfectly fine). Why not look at the sizing label and decided to try and look for another dress with a different label?\n\nPlus size can be taken as a suble comment, affecting adolescents whose healthy weight needs a larger size, which could lead to body issues.\n\nWhile I agree a size is a size, it holds nothing to a person or their worth. Not everyone sees it that way, especially with the term plus sized being a wide range. \n\nEven if lets say, it was like an L, XL, or XXL, those are actual sizes compared to 'plus sized'.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think screaming at you for picking her \"correct\" size is more insensitive. They should be happy that even got a gift in the first place. \n\nNTA,", "NTA you kindle explained the limitations. Her being fat is not something you even brought up!", "NAH, except SIL. \n\nAs a teen I had terribly body dysphoria, and believed I was plus sized, despite fitting in medium and smaller. Unfortunately, women\u2019s fashion does not have a standard. And XXS/XS in your brand may be non existent in another. \n\nAlternatively what that other brand labels as plus size may be another brands M/L or L/XL \n\nI once worked for a store where I was size 10 in jeans, but in American eagle I was a size 4. It made NO SENSE. \n\nI think you should have explained to your niece in the first place that her measurements may not be available in the sample sizes, but you will try. And you probably should have told her there is a chance you would have to get something different. \n\nYou probably should have also explained the evils of women\u2019s sizing in fashion to your niece and that while the dress you got her is labeled \u201cplus size\u201d doesn\u2019t mean she is. \n\nI completely feel for and understand your niece\u2019s hurt and disappointment.

I remember feeling disbelief at the craziness of that, especially since the 12s of my teenager days were pretty on par with the 8s that my mother still had from her younger years (and fit me really well). I'm just thankful that I wasn't super body conscious over it and was pretty level headed about the fact.  The fashion industry sucks, and it's getting worse. Today I wear 16s and still don't feel bad about it. It is what it is.\n\nOP, NTA.", "Plus size is a range of sizes.. it would have defo had an actual size in there too.\n\nNiece and her mother need to get over it and not blame OP for buying her something her niece literally asked for!", "I\u2019m not arguing you, I just want to understand how is OP say fault for the industry\u2019s labels?\n\nPlus size may be seen as a comment on weight but OP was not calling the niece plus size or fat, she bought a dress that matched the measurements. \n\nI am a fat girl. I am plus sized. And I wouldn\u2019t blame someone for getting me something plus sized because that\u2019s just what matches my measurements. \n\nSure OP could have talked to her niece about it first and explained \u201cI\u2019m really sorry that this is the label, it\u2019s not what I think of you but unfortunately the fashion industry for women\u2019s sizes is arbitrary and fluctuates between brands\u201d. \n\nI really don\u2019t see how OP was TA here"]}
