My company is not size inclusive anyway and the sample size items I pick from are usually XXS/XS, I have seen a few S items, but as the items are given to my whole company they are the ones that go first.\n\nMay gave me her measurements, a size which in my history of 8 years, I have seen twice in the sample sizes, but I go quite late as my size is usually left. I reminded May that the way we get clothing and its sizing tends to run small, and sometimes other departments see items first and also asked if she wanted anything else for her birthday but she only wanted a dress. I still asked my coworkers to keep an eye out for anything in May's size and went earlier ro get clothing, but I didn't see anything in her size.\n\nI got May a designer dress from a brand more affordable we also like in her size. She thanked me for her gift, but I could tell she was disappointed. Afterwards, she found the label inside which says plus size. My SIL has yelled at me for fat shaming a young girl and said I should be ashamed of myself, but in my eyes that is just a size and May's size is healthy for her height.\n\nI went over to see May and sat her down and explained our clothing sizes and the limitations of the samples, but it may have come across insensitive. She didn't say anything to me and left after. I know now I should have said something about the sizing earlier, but I didn't know how to bring it up, and I had about 7 months to find May's size and thought I would find something., as we tend to get more samples this time of year.\n\nETA: May does 'fit' a size we stock according to our size chart, but it runs small, which is something I communicated. She is only considered plus size in some designer brands, including mine but is still slender. The clothing we get for free is because it can't go to retail; loose thread, mislabelled, has a small stain (usually washes out), ex-runway or sample sizes.I only agreed to find her a dress as I have coworkers of a similar size to May that have found stuff, I wouldn't tell her I could find her something full well knowing I can't? I had no idea the dress I got her said plus size inside as the tags and online didn't.", "created_utc": 1687768850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jbmsa/aita_for_fat_shaming_my_niece/", "score": 2323, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think as a teenager I would have rather had someone explain to me clearly that these fashion labels tend to skew to extremely small sizes, that it\u2019s not at all a reflection on me and my size, but rather how effed up fashion and society writ large can be about body size.
