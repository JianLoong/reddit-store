What is the deal with that?", "NTA, why didn\u2019t your husband talk about this with you? If he assumed the buddy pass would work, that still needed to be discussed when he was purchasing the tickets.", "NTA- WHOA OP you have been married presumably 12+ years and your husband didn\u2019t communicate vacation plans with you nor buy a ticket for you. You then proceeded to find out as if it was an afterthought? WTH is wrong with your husband and what did he have to say?", "I'm confused as to why your husband bought plane tickets for himself and your son, and didn't tell you about it. Why didn't he tell you?

Does this put a much bigger financial onus on him?", "INFO: Did you and your husband not have any discussion about \"Spring Break plans\" once you knew free tickets were off the table? This seems bizarre.", "NTA if your husb went ahead and bought two tickets, excluding you, without talking to you. You're a couple. Who plans holidays like that?", "NTA. I sincerely hope this is fake. Your husband is a major AH for 1) not talking to you about this first and 2) going without you. You basically bought all 3 tickets for the past decade through perks of your job and now that you don't have the same perk your husband can't be bothered to buy you a ticket??? This is absurd, selfish behavior and is probably a symptom of something bigger. I would take the time he and your son are away to really think about this relationship and if you want to continue. I'm not one of those \"just divorce him\" people, but this is so rude and disrespectful that I'd be wondering what else is going on. What is he telling your son as to why you aren't going with?", "Is there more to this? Just getting tix without you is a leap.", "Info: How did the conversation go when you told him that you had decided to leave your career to start a new one?", "INFO - you are working really hard not to answer questions, so I'm going to try once:\nWas the decision to leave your old job and start your business mutually agreed upon after discussion with your husband? That's a yes or a no. You say your finances have always been separate, so have you, on all the other vacations, paid for your own fare, etc., while your husband paid for himself and your son? Your answers to these 2 questions will guide my judgment.", "Your husband planned a trip to Maui with your son and not only didn't include you, but didn't inform you.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd, wow, what kind of an AH does that?", "NTA.

He completely disregarded you now that you can't give him a free pass", "NTA but why didn't he get you a plane ticket as well? How come he didn't even talk to you about it?? This is very odd...", "You use the word husband! Why would your husband not take you on a vacation he's taking your child, that you all usually go on? We need the missing missing reason! If you are not making enough money for the family to afford it, then why is anybody going? \n\nYou either purposely left something out or something's going on that you are not aware of, but this is not normal behavior unless there's a problem in a relationship!", "NTA but I wonder if this wasn't purposeful to punish  you for leaving your job. Was he OK with you doing that or is he resentful? I get him not understanding a buddy pass but isn't it weird he planned  all of this without mentioning it until it was too late for you to get a ticket?", "Sounds like your husband resents not getting free tickets anymore, and is punishing you for it.", "I generally think straight up ignoring someone because you're annoyed with them is a particularly childish course of action.\n\nBut you need more info here. Presumably your husband offered you a reason as to why he bought the tickets without asking you.

I don't even know how separate finances work when one of the people stops getting an income. \n\nWhy is it on your husband, and especially on your son, to settle on cheaper vacation just because you wanted a change in jobs?? You said the change is for the family. But as  I understand it, people who have separate finances contribute certain % to family expenses and keep the rest for themselves. So you earning more would only benefit you.", "Ok, because you no longer have access to the cheaper flights, and in the past, you covered these expenses, I think your husband should have just bought your ticket for this family vacation while you get your business underway (provided it's not some form of MLM!). It does take time to get established, and you said your income was reduced, not zero, so I assume you would be contributing to food, sight seeing, etc. I think you are N T A for feeling upset and I think your husband is kind of mean. But your question was about ignoring/not communicating with your husband. Despite your very valid feelings, the silent treatment is never a good solution, so on that, sorry, YTA.", "ESH (softly)\n\nNot because you don\u2019t deserve to be mad (that\u2019s warranted) and rightfully so. But you\u2019re an adult and not speaking to your husband isn\u2019t going to fix this issue. \n\nSo many red flags that I read through that really calls in to question your relationship.. I think it\u2019s definitely time to have a serious conversation with your partner around why tf he\u2019s bailing on you to have a vacation and not including you in those plans.\n\nTo be honest, I find it hard to believe it\u2019s even true..", "There's a gap in this story. I'd like to hear the husbands side.", "ESH\n\ndo you two still like each other? you seem to have maybe made a whole career change with little discussion. he bought a whole vacation (without you) without discussion.  \ni dont get it.", "Is there a reason he didn't buy a plane ticket for you? Did he start planning this when you still worked for the airline and assumed you could get your ticket for free? If so, can your husband not help cover the expenses of a new ticket for you?\n\nI'm kind of leaning ESH. It's weird that your husband didn't let you know he was planning a vacation, and had already bought plane tickets for it. But it's also kind of childish to give your husband the cold shoulder. And even if you'll still talk with your son, it will probably make things awkward and less enjoyable for him to know you're so angry about them being there.", "ESH.  You ask if your the AH for refusing to talk to your husband while he is on vacation or discuss his trip with him.  Yes you are the AH because that is called pouting and it is what 7 year olds do and it is completely ineffective.\n\nBut more importantly it also just magnifies you and your husbands problem.  You evidently don\u2019t  communicate.  He is an AH for not talking to you about vacation plans.  And you plan to respond with the exact same behavior - not talking to him.  Are you starting to see the pattern here?\n\nHere is a novel approach.  Sit down with your husband and explain how you felt about him planning a vacation without you and ask him why he didn\u2019t talk to you about it so you could plan a \u201cfamily\u201d vacation as an actual family.  And start setting aside time for the two of you to actually sit down and talk regularly - to make plans, discuss problems, and support each other.  Agree on which decisions or plans must always be made jointly.  But please don\u2019t pout.  It solves nothing.", "YTA - If you have been able to go the past ten years I don't understand why you are being so resentful about missing one.

It doesn't matter that they're 'legal' where pyramid schemes are not. That's a technicality. They're still designed to exploit vulnerable people. The business model is unsustainable by design. MLM schemes involve two kinds of people: those who know they're running a scam and are looking to make money by exploiting others, and those who have been taken in by the scam. I'd like to think you're the latter, but either way, I'd very strongly suggest you drop this \"biz\" and find a job that isn't out to directly exploit you (at least more than is normal in a capitalist system).\n\nBut the extent to which either you or your partner are \"the asshole\" depends to a great degree on how much each of you knows about your respective situations, and what discussions, if any, you've already had. Without knowing that, no judgement I could make on who's in the right, or not, could be relevant. Would I normally expect someone to consider their partner while booking a trip? Absolutely.

Quitting your job and not making as much money as expected as like THE defining factors. \n\nSecondly, HUH??? Why did your husband presumably hide the purchased tickets? Why did he buy two, but for him and his son and not him and you? Hell why didn\u2019t he buy three? Did you ask him any of these questions, or were you just mildly annoyed that all of this was happening?? You seem to be very not upset for essentially being ditched on a vacation. Most people would be EXPLODING with anger/sadness, as this would be a huge betrayal of trust. But you just won\u2019t talk to him?? What kind of reaction is that?? AND WHY DIDNT YOU BUY A TICKET??? Your husband seems to think two tickets was a reasonable purchase, surely you could justify a third in order to accommodate them on the family vacation??? Again, why didn\u2019t he buy you one already??????? It\u2019s not like he was opposed to you going, hell he pretty much asked you to buy a ticket, SO WHY. DIDNT. HE. BUY. YOU. ONE. IN THE FIRST PLACE???!!!! Like why wasn\u2019t your first question \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you buy me one\u201d? This is the most pertinent information to the post, because we know he\u2019s not opposed to you going. I have a million more questions, but nothing makes any sense.\n\nI\u2019m proposing a theory that OP is probably TA. There are entire paragraphs of missing information and details and this is one of the few posts were we NEED the other half of the story, because the way OP has laid it out, it actually makes zero sense. OP has left out vital information for a reason (why didn\u2019t your husband buy you a ticket and/or tell you he was buying them?) and I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because they know that the answer to all the questions we have would make them look like the asshole. \n\nOr maybe the husband is fucking crazy and decided to go behind his wife\u2019s back, purchase 2 tickets without her knowledge for him and your son, and deliberately split up the family.

Do you have savings to cover your share of expenses  until you reach that \"future success\"? Most of all, would your husband object to you leaving you job as a flight attendant if you had taken other employment eg waitressing or is his objection to this business that sounds a lot like an MLM. I work because being unemployed is boring, not because I need to. However, even though my husband can support us with his wage alone, my income means we can send our kids to a better school, we can put aside more savings and afford more perks.

You don't have to answer to me but it is very understandable that your husband is not happy, even if you working is not the difference between poverty or three meals a day.\n\nAs for your husband, it is toxic planning a holiday without telling you as some kind of petty punishment.

A lot of info missing here. Perhaps he's resentful of the drop in income and pulled this AH move by not including you on this trip.\n\nIgnoring him should not be your big question here. Why did he exclude you, especially after your previous job got him free tickets for years to Maui, should be the real question.", "It sounds more like ignorance than malice on your husband's part.  You have separate finances and he thought you could get a buddy pass so there was no need to buy you a ticket.  He should have talked to you about it, but I don't think his behavior is all that bad here.", "You're leaving a lot of detail out here", "YTA if you quit your job to join a MLM.", "Sounds like he is punishing her for the career change even though he expressed support.\n\nTo me it reads like \"how can I say she should have stuck to a job she hated because I was getting free shit... without saying those words\"\n\nHe sounds like a d@#k.", "If that\u2019s the case he is not in a financial position to go on a holiday at all.

Only those who set up the MLM to start make money. It's a scam.", "It stands for multi-level marketing. As others said, it\u2019s a pyramid scheme where you only really make money by bringing in people under you to sell more product, and they bring in people under them. It is possible for people to make money, but it\u2019s at the expense of the people at the bottom, and very few people make it.
