That's extremely weird and it feels like there's half the story missing.", "Info:  What was your husband's reasoning for not telling you and asking if you want to go?", "NTA....so your husband...went and bought tickets for himself and your son without even saying anything to you?  What is the deal with that?", "NTA, why didn\u2019t your husband talk about this with you? If he assumed the buddy pass would work, that still needed to be discussed when he was purchasing the tickets.", "NTA- WHOA OP you have been married presumably 12+ years and your husband didn\u2019t communicate vacation plans with you nor buy a ticket for you. You then proceeded to find out as if it was an afterthought? WTH is wrong with your husband and what did he have to say?", "I'm confused as to why your husband bought plane tickets for himself and your son, and didn't tell you about it. Why didn't he tell you? Need more information.", "NTA \n\nHe booked a trip for him and your son without telling you. \n\n\nIs he super resentful of you leaving your job? Does this put a much bigger financial onus on him?", "INFO: Did you and your husband not have any discussion about \"Spring Break plans\" once you knew free tickets were off the table? This seems bizarre.", "NTA if your husb went ahead and bought two tickets, excluding you, without talking to you. You're a couple. Who plans holidays like that?", "NTA. I sincerely hope this is fake. Your husband is a major AH for 1) not talking to you about this first and 2) going without you. You basically bought all 3 tickets for the past decade through perks of your job and now that you don't have the same perk your husband can't be bothered to buy you a ticket??? This is absurd, selfish behavior and is probably a symptom of something bigger. I would take the time he and your son are away to really think about this relationship and if you want to continue. I'm not one of those \"just divorce him\" people, but this is so rude and disrespectful that I'd be wondering what else is going on. What is he telling your son as to why you aren't going with?", "Is there more to this? Just getting tix without you is a leap.", "Info: How did the conversation go when you told him that you had decided to leave your career to start a new one?", "INFO - you are working really hard not to answer questions, so I'm going to try once:\nWas the decision to leave your old job and start your business mutually agreed upon after discussion with your husband? That's a yes or a no. You say your finances have always been separate, so have you, on all the other vacations, paid for your own fare, etc., while your husband paid for himself and your son? Your answers to these 2 questions will guide my judgment.", "Your husband planned a trip to Maui with your son and not only didn't include you, but didn't inform you.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd, wow, what kind of an AH does that?", "NTA. Why didn't he talk to you ahead of time? This is not a healthy way to handle things, even if finances are separate or tight.", "NTA\n\nBut thats kind of fucked up he didn't buy you a ticket or at the very least said he was buying two for him and the son and to see if you wanted to get buy yours then. He completely disregarded you now that you can't give him a free pass", "NTA but why didn't he get you a plane ticket as well? How come he didn't even talk to you about it?? This is very odd...", "You use the word husband! Why would your husband not take you on a vacation he's taking your child, that you all usually go on? We need the missing missing reason! If you are not making enough money for the family to afford it, then why is anybody going? \n\nYou either purposely left something out or something's going on that you are not aware of, but this is not normal behavior unless there's a problem in a relationship!", "NTA but I wonder if this wasn't purposeful to punish  you for leaving your job. Was he OK with you doing that or is he resentful? I get him not understanding a buddy pass but isn't it weird he planned  all of this without mentioning it until it was too late for you to get a ticket?", "Sounds like your husband resents not getting free tickets anymore, and is punishing you for it.", "I generally think straight up ignoring someone because you're annoyed with them is a particularly childish course of action.\n\nBut you need more info here. Presumably your husband offered you a reason as to why he bought the tickets without asking you. What was it?", "I\u2019d be gone when gets home to be honest.\n\nThis is no marriage.", "INFO: is your new business venture an MLM? You\u2019re giving me MLM vibes", "You have separate finances. Whose idea was that?? \nYou quit your job. Did you ask him if he's OK with it?? All the way ok with it?? I don't even know how separate finances work when one of the people stops getting an income. \n\nWhy is it on your husband, and especially on your son, to settle on cheaper vacation just because you wanted a change in jobs?? You said the change is for the family. But as  I understand it, people who have separate finances contribute certain % to family expenses and keep the rest for themselves. So you earning more would only benefit you.", "Ok, because you no longer have access to the cheaper flights, and in the past, you covered these expenses, I think your husband should have just bought your ticket for this family vacation while you get your business underway (provided it's not some form of MLM!). It does take time to get established, and you said your income was reduced, not zero, so I assume you would be contributing to food, sight seeing, etc. I think you are N T A for feeling upset and I think your husband is kind of mean. But your question was about ignoring/not communicating with your husband. Despite your very valid feelings, the silent treatment is never a good solution, so on that, sorry, YTA.", "ESH (softly)\n\nNot because you don\u2019t deserve to be mad (that\u2019s warranted) and rightfully so. But you\u2019re an adult and not speaking to your husband isn\u2019t going to fix this issue. \n\nSo many red flags that I read through that really calls in to question your relationship.. I think it\u2019s definitely time to have a serious conversation with your partner around why tf he\u2019s bailing on you to have a vacation and not including you in those plans.\n\nTo be honest, I find it hard to believe it\u2019s even true..", "There's a gap in this story. I'd like to hear the husbands side.", "ESH\n\ndo you two still like each other? you seem to have maybe made a whole career change with little discussion. he bought a whole vacation (without you) without discussion.  \ni dont get it.", "Is there a reason he didn't buy a plane ticket for you? Did he start planning this when you still worked for the airline and assumed you could get your ticket for free? If so, can your husband not help cover the expenses of a new ticket for you?\n\nI'm kind of leaning ESH. It's weird that your husband didn't let you know he was planning a vacation, and had already bought plane tickets for it. But it's also kind of childish to give your husband the cold shoulder. And even if you'll still talk with your son, it will probably make things awkward and less enjoyable for him to know you're so angry about them being there.", "ESH.  You ask if your the AH for refusing to talk to your husband while he is on vacation or discuss his trip with him.  Yes you are the AH because that is called pouting and it is what 7 year olds do and it is completely ineffective.\n\nBut more importantly it also just magnifies you and your husbands problem.  You evidently don\u2019t  communicate.  He is an AH for not talking to you about vacation plans.  And you plan to respond with the exact same behavior - not talking to him.  Are you starting to see the pattern here?\n\nHere is a novel approach.  Sit down with your husband and explain how you felt about him planning a vacation without you and ask him why he didn\u2019t talk to you about it so you could plan a \u201cfamily\u201d vacation as an actual family.  And start setting aside time for the two of you to actually sit down and talk regularly - to make plans, discuss problems, and support each other.  Agree on which decisions or plans must always be made jointly.  But please don\u2019t pout.  It solves nothing.", "YTA - If you have been able to go the past ten years I don't understand why you are being so resentful about missing one.  Why not just work it out that you and your son go without your husband in a year if money is still tight.  Seems fair doesn't it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
