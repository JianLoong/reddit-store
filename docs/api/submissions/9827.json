I mean, this sounds like a blessing in disguise. Absolutely do not move onto your parents\u2019 property. That was a ghastly idea. Unless you want to spend the rest of your life as their unpaid nanny.", "NTA. And consider moving further away. For example, college. Or the military.", "I would seek therapy for how to set boundaries with your parents and siblings. It is NOT your job to take care of them.", "They literally make you responsible for children that aren't yours. You have every right to be upset at their choices that have a direct impact on your life. NTA\n\nStop being their unpaid second mother.", "NTA- they are having another baby not to PUSH you away, but PULL you closer cause you\u2019ll \u201chave\u201d to help\u2026 use the money you have saved to go to college and stay in residence. Go make friends and decide what you want to do with your future", "NTA. Here\u2019s what you do: escape. Get as much money together as you can\u2014along with all your paperwork\u2014and leave. Live your own life.", "I think it's less about not wanting another sibling, rather, you don't want to have to take care of another one of their children.  There's a difference there, I don't sense any jealousy from you, just weariness and betrayal as they seem to expect you to give up your life for their choices.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your parents don\u2019t need to involve you in their decision making or family planning, and they certainly don\u2019t need your permission. However you\u2019re fully within your rights to be upset. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable that you wouldn\u2019t want another sibling. You may need to adjust your future plans, as long as you live with your parents or on their property, you\u2019ll probably always be a free babysitter. Consider college out of state or if not college, moving a reasonable distance for work. But word to the wise, you probably shouldn\u2019t mention your plans ahead of time.", "NAH in the sense that your parents aren't obligated to consult with you in deciding whether to have another baby. They have the right to tell you any way they want. You also have the right to feel upset though. \n\nFor your part, soon you'll get to live your life, and make friends. You decide how much you will, or won't, help with the baby. The baby might force you to change your plans about living in a mini-house on property your parents buy, but having to deal with plans going sideways is part of adulthood. \n\nAfter raising up siblings, moving out and looking after yourself should be easy. Doesn't mean that you will lose your family either if that's a worry.", "NTA this is called parentification and it isn\u2019t good for children. Yeah families help each other and some kids are more led to help with younger siblings, but taking the choice away is wrong and forcing children to be parents is **wrong**.", "You\u2019re not the asshole for being frustrated with your parents, but they aren\u2019t replacing you. You need to move out of that house and start finding your own place in the world. You\u2019re not a nanny, you\u2019re a human being with thoughts and goals and desires, you\u2019re an individual. They\u2019ve depended on you for free childcare way too much, and moving into your own mini home on the same property is not going to change that. Moving to an apartment or into a house with friends or literally anywhere they don\u2019t own, is going to be the only thing that actually makes it clear to your parents that you are your own person and that you\u2019re not a nanny for their children. \n\nYou deserve to find out who you are, you deserve friends and a space all your own, a life that is all your own. Do what you need to do to make it happen OP. Don\u2019t light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.", "NTA. Take the money you\u2019ve saved and move out. You aren\u2019t obligated to take care of their children and living on their property means you\u2019d forever be their childcare then their elder care. Did you never want to go to college or trade school?  It might be a good idea to get your GED and then move out. You need to at least have a high school diploma or a GED to get any sort of decent job. Even crappy jobs require them. The only jobs that don\u2019t will be shit.", "NTA.  It is there choice to have another kid.  It is not your job to make them fell safe or give up your life to take care of your siblings", "Time to spread your wings and fly. You're an adult, it's time to make your own life. Take some of that money you saved and get an apartment. You can live nearby your parents, but not too close.

There\u2019s a big age gap between my oldest (of 5 also) and my youngest. If we chose to have another baby, it wouldn\u2019t affect my oldest like you\u2019re being affected because the kids are my (and my husband\u2019s) responsibility to take care of, not my oldest\u2019s.   \n  \n  \nOf course extra help with kids is always nice. But if you\u2019re always taking care of them, you\u2019re being taken advantage of. My older kids love being with the younger one and enjoy her as a sibling because I don\u2019t force them to take care of her.", "NTA - you did not consent to be the parent, they consented, they can handle the responsibility. It sounds like you\u2019re angry at the care you would\u2019ve received had they limited how many children they\u2019re having and had more time for you. I\u2019m sorry. Start your own life, you\u2019re not beholden to them", "Yeah I don't understand. OP it seems like you've been institutionalized, and you actually are trying to stay in jail longer. Are you upset that your parents are having another kid that you will also have to be a second parent ? Or are you upset that you're being replaced?", "NTA- I think you need to move out for real and start your life\n\nYou will forever be miserable if you stay where you are at \n\nBest of luck", "They are the ones choosing to have kids. They are the ones who take care of them. They are sacrificing your life to make their lives easier. \n\nMove in with grandparents or an aunt, save as much as you can, and make your own life. You\u2019re the one who will have to live with the regret if you don\u2019t, not them.", "NTA. Obviously your parents have every right to have more kids if they want to, and it's ultimately their decision and you have no say in it. But equally, they have no right to expect you to help look after a sibling you don't want. I'm sure you'd love your sibling and bond with them, but that's very different to helping with the responsibilities, which shouldn't be forced on any child. Parents make a decision to have children, the older siblings shouldn't be treated as free babysitters and whatnot. It sounds like they've treated you that way and you're simply sick of it, which is fair.\n\nI don't know that they're trying to replace you or anything though. Maybe they just like having a big family or hell, maybe it's the youngest siblings they're \"replacing\" in a sense. A lot of parents miss the baby stage when their kids finally start getting a bit more independent, in school, etc. The eight year olds have probably grown up enough that they're feeling a bit of a tug towards that baby phase again.", "You are definitely NTA. Your parents are abusing you with their lifestyle. We don\u2019t (generally) live on farms and need \u201chands\u201d to work the fields anymore so having tons of children is something you should only do if you have the time and money to support them- yourself. Not by giving the job to someone else. Nobody needs more than 2 kids. You cannot take care of children and teach them AND work. Some people just can\u2019t even do any of these things but keep spitting out kids. Sounds like your parents are this type of person. Selfish and entitled. Save your money, get an education (at a non religious college) and get the hell out. There\u2019s a great big wonderful world out there that\u2019s waiting for you.", "NTA\n\nMove away from them, live your own life. You are not there to be a babysitter for them.", "ESH - it's their right to procreate, but it's also your right to go off on your own without their help so since you've already been saving money to move out then continue doing so and avoid their financial assistance while setting boundaries about babysitting.  You're not forced to do anything you don't want to do once you're legally an adult, if you're \"on your own\" so achieve that status, whether it's an apartment, tiny home, etc. and be happy your parents if they choose to expand their family.  That's called living your life.", "YTA. You\u2019re nearly 18. Move out if you don\u2019t feel like partaking anymore.", "YTA\n\nThey don't need your permission to have children.", "Her parents aren\u2019t obligated to consult with her in deciding to have another baby, but they also shouldn\u2019t be relying on her for childcare for all the rest of their kids. This sounds like classic parentification.", "18 is just an arbitrary number to symbolise adulthood. Realistically everyone adapts at their own pace. Seems unfair to expect your oldest child to be a free babysitter in return for staying at home until such a time that they can move out. Parents should support their kids, not treat that support as a transaction.", ":: Jana Duggar has entered the chat ::", "NTA\u2014run far far away from their parentification.  And warn your 13 year old brother that he\u2019ll probably be the new extra parent as soon as you\u2019re gone, so he should start planning his exit strategy for as soon as he\u2019s legally able.", "INFO: do you have access to your birth certificate? Do you have a social security number? Do you have a job and if so, where are your paychecks deposited? Did you finish any formal schooling at all, and does your state require testing of any kind for homeschooled students?  \n\nYou'll need these things to establish yourself in the real world away from these people. If you don't have access to them, there are networks specializing in helping homeschool survivors get on their feet as adults. NTA, but please take my advice and start making plans to get further away rather than trying to stay close.", "To quote a certian movie: GET OUT!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nGet out of there.  It sounds like you've been raised in isolation.  I very much hope your home schooling has prepared you to go to university or to enter a vocational training program.  Please look online to see what's out there for you.  (With all your childcare skills, you could probably be a highly paid nanny with the understanding that you have time to take some community college courses.)\n\nIf you've been saving for a mini-home, I'm assuming you have the financial resources and the skills to leave once you've finished home-school high school.  You're on the verge of adulthood; adulthood should not involved being trapped taking care of your parents' new baby.\n\nBut, P.S., your parents don't owe you the info that they're planning a baby.  And you don't owe them one more minute of your time taking care of their babies.", "NTA. But don't stop them, move out and if they ask you to babysit, refuse.", "Ok so NTA for not wanting another sibling but this is not your choice as it is your parents. What I am hearing you say is that they are being shitty to you and that you have been stuck rearing your siblings as if they were yours. I would look to see what your options are. Specifically you can cut back on the work you are doing to care for your siblings as they are not your kids and see what your living options are outside of your parents home. \nThis is a shitty hand you were dealt and I am sorry for that. You now have to work with what you have and make the best choice for you.", "NTA, because it's not that you don't want a sibling, really, it's that you don't want the nasty treatment towards you that your parents attach to that sibling."]}
