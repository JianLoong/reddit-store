It sounds like they've treated you that way and you're simply sick of it, which is fair.\n\nI don't know that they're trying to replace you or anything though. Maybe they just like having a big family or hell, maybe it's the youngest siblings they're \"replacing\" in a sense.

We don\u2019t (generally) live on farms and need \u201chands\u201d to work the fields anymore so having tons of children is something you should only do if you have the time and money to support them- yourself. Not by giving the job to someone else. Nobody needs more than 2 kids. You cannot take care of children and teach them AND work. Some people just can\u2019t even do any of these things but keep spitting out kids. Sounds like your parents are this type of person. Selfish and entitled.
