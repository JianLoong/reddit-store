Maybe when people aren\u2019t so angry sit down and talk to your adult parents about what happened and why you made that choice in a calm manner.

So why would it occur to you to bring it up, vs. being a fun suprise?\n\nAnd a Ford Mustang, although a two door, isn\u2019t exactly what I would call a compact car.\n\nI get how upsetting this is for Amy, it is embarrassing when your size means you can\u2019t fit, especially when it\u2019s because you are oversized in a way that society is VERY negative about. That she cannot physically sit in your vehicle safely - from the seatbelt issue to the interference with the gear stick - isn\u2019t you telling her to be ashamed.\n\nFatphobia is a very real thing.\n\nAnd there are definitely assumptions about people\u2019s sizes when designing any kind of vehicle and seating.\n\nBut that\u2019s not your fault or your responsibility. You DO have a responsibility to be a safe driver and to keep your passengers safe, so if someone can\u2019t or refuses to wear a seat belt and interferes with the stick - it is responsible not to drive them.", "NTA.

I presume her other crowd didn't have a person who would have caused these issues?

I feel so bad for that poor girl.", "> Due to her obesity, the only place she could sit was in the front seat which caused two issues.\n\nHe let her get in the car and didn't say no until something about the size of the front seat set him off. Which doesn't make sense, because the front seat of his old car was smaller. Which insinuates that he would not let her sit in the front of his old car. So the issue sounds like he wanted her in the back because she's fat. That sounds like fat shaming.\n\nOP can correct me if I'm wrong, but he didn't write it as if the seat belt extender was the issue. He wrote it as if he would have let her ride *in the back* without a seatbelt.", "I think he wrote it with the insinuation that he would have let her in the Outback, which is smaller. This is why I posted INFO. If the real issue is that he could have put her in the back in the smaller car so nobody could see her but he cannot put her in the back in the car with the larger seats, but he doesn't want her in the front, then that's pretty obvious fat shaming.", "Nah they didn't consider that the Outback is a four door, or give the dimensions of the Outback's rear seat.", "Depends on where you live.", "Many anti depressants lower metabolism and increase hunger feeling. They'll literally eat until full but full is no longer what their body says. They're still eating too much but it's not always a free choice and I blame them as much as I blame their doctors for not immediately putting them with a dietitian as to make sure they stay healthy while getting their mental health sorted out.", "Aw, you tried.  Not my fault you don't understand medical conditions, medication side-effects, depression, hormone imbalances, etc.  Simple person, simple judgment.", "Not a factual statement", "They can absolutely take action not to get to morbidly obese weights, it takes more effort, but that's no excuse for getting so fat a seat belt no longer fits. If a deaf person doesn't want to learn sign language, is it not their own fault that they can't communicate? The deafness isn't their fault, but the not wanting to learn sign language is. \n\nAnd for at least two of the issues you mentioned, weight loss/control is actually a recommended treatment to prevent more medical issues. Another one, hypothyroidism, is treated with medication, once it gets to a point where your weight is 'not under your control' you die without meds. I live with someone who has this, he needs his meds and on top of that needs to watch his weight more carefully, so he does. If your bones break more easily because of a genetic disease, are you not expected to be more careful? If you're born with a heart disease, are you gonna try to run marathons? Why should this be any different when it comes to weight?", "Still not seeing the relevance. You're not even the person I was responding to.", "I'm not going to comment on the mother and sister. I'm just not liking how many people are blaming *Amy* for this situation. Amy is 16. She is not at fault for literally any of this.\n\n>it's worth checking the transport is suitable\n\nI know nothing about manual transmission. It's not crazy to assume Amy doesn't know she doesn't fit in manual transmission cars.\n\n>I know I'd never let anyone sit in my car without a seatbelt\n\nExtremely obese people are sometimes big enough to not require one. Doctors can write notes to that effect. The idea is that the seatbelt holds you in your seat in a crash. Some people are so big that their gut is against the dashboard, and the dashboard prevents then from being ejected from the vehicle, same as the seatbelt.\n\nAgain, this isn't something anyone should be expected to know. That's why NAH.", "OP said she didn\u2019t want to get in the back as the seats fold and she wasn\u2019t sure her legs would fit when climbing in.", "All of this has been explained. \n\nYou seem to be trying really really hard to blame OP for this.\n\nOp did a nice thing, picking up his sister and friends. \n\nHe shows up, one larger friend he has never met before doesn't feel comfortable sitting in the backseat because she's concerned she won't be able to get out. She can't comfortably fit into the front seat for reasons we've been through.\n\nOP's mom and sister get mad and say if he didn't switch cars, none of this would be an issue.\n\nWhat exactly is it that OP did wrong here? He sounds like a nice guy who worked hard, got a nice new car, and unfortunately somebody he isn't obligated to drive and has never met before couldn't fit into his car. What was he supposed to do? \"Brb, I'll go rent a uhaul\"", "I feel bad that her parents are neglecting her and abusing her. She is so obese at 16 she's a needs a walker. This is nothing but abuse.", "Why?! She's so obese that she needs a walker age 16. That is absolutely horrendous and unacceptable.", "Sounds a bit like ESH. I don't think OP is being the most reliable narrator because something doesn't add up. I also think that if her friend is truly that large, she should stick a seatbelt extender in her purse and it would solve most issues.", "> He wrote it as if he would have let her ride in the back without a seatbelt.\n\nI don't know how you came to that conclusion, he just said she was only able to sit in the front seat. \nHe explained in the comment that you need to climb over while the front sit is down to reach the back sit, which Amy didn't want to do. \n\nI still don't understand why the compersion to the old car, he never driven her in his old car.", "Show me your dietetics degree and we'll talk.", "You literally claimed any had been in his other car\u2026 which is Not true?  \nThen you whine about relevance?\u2026.", "Ok but they\u2019re part of the story and the ones that are making him question whether he is the AH or not so it is kind of relevant.\n\nI don\u2019t think seatbelt size has anything to do with whether it\u2019s an automatic or a manual, that would be more about make & model surely. \n\nI might get downvoted for this but I still wouldn\u2019t be comfortable. What about side on collisions or a car rolling? If they can get in and out of the car, they can move from their seat. I will admit though I do have slightly heightened anxiety over driving & potential accidents so I may seem a bit overboard for some! I do what I can to ensure there are no projectiles and a seatbelt on a person is number 1. \n\nBesides it\u2019s kind of moot if Amy didn\u2019t have a note.", "Thats why they said they feel bad for them, its called empathy but it takes until mid adulthood to really get it.", "Yeah I know someone who carries one.", "He mentioned his old car as a sticking point, so that's why I want the INFO. The old car is actually smaller in the front seat. So that seems like the front seat wouldn't have been an issue in the old car because he would have forced her to sit in the back. I need OP to tell me that he didn't force her to sit in the back because she's fat, because that does insinuate some fat shaming went on. Or OP could he would have refused a ride in both cars, no matter where she sat, then no fat shaming. Or OP can say she was absolutely massive and I would have let her ride in the front of the Subaru. Then I'd have to call BS, because look at the [interior of his old car.](https://www.edmunds.com/subaru/outback/2005/pictures/interior/) The issue would have been the same if she was truly that large: she would have been pressing on the shifter which is dangerous, and not only that, it would have been *worse* than the Mustang because the Subaru has smaller front seats.", "You first", ">if they can get in and out of the car, they can move from their seat\n\nYou can move in your seatbelt, too. There's usually a few centimeters of wiggle room even when locked. Again, I don't know much about it, but it is approved by doctors in certain specific cases.\n\n>it's kind of moot if Amy didn't have a note\n\nLegally, yes, but the physics of it doesn't change.", "The question you should have asked is \"did you ever driven her in your old car?\"", "Nah, I'm not risking my license for a Redditor, but at least you've proven you don't have one ;)", "He didn't, so the question is *would* he have let her sit in the front of his old car or, really, in the front of any car.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a Really!
