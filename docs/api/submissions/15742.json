It\u2019s the parents responsibility to make sure there\u2019s more than 10 min of hot water.\n\nAnd if the water heater can\u2019t be fixed (such as for financial reasons) then the parents should help the kids come up with a plan to make sure they can both get clean before school.\n\nSo I guess NAH except maybe the parents if they won\u2019t fix it or find a solution that works for both kids.", "Well I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s just a rough estimate but it is long enough that when I go there\u2019s no more hot water and it\u2019s just lukewarm", "Agreed, nothing wrong with brushing your teeth in the shower - but what's up with all the hot water being used up?  How is that possible in 10 mins?", "I don\u2019t know anything about water heaters. They have to be flushed??", "I remember complaining about the water heater and my dad put the dial higher so the water was hotter but then changed it back to low and then I went and changed it to high but then got yelled at cus it\u2019s too hot so idk what to do anymore \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "I do but sometimes my classes start later", "IKR I wouldn\u2019t even be able to do my hair in 10 minutes lol", "10 minutes is nothing! I think my husband\u2019s record in ten years is 1.5 hours \ud83e\udd23 (he had a head cold and the hot water was helping the sinus pressure).

And he doesn\u2019t properly put soap everywhere. Not on his back because \u201cI can\u2019t reach there\u201d and not behind his ears or toes and armpits.", ">Him brushing his teeth in the shower is a bit gross. Your brother needs to stop doing that. Or at least clean up after himself after he finishes brushing.\n\nWhy is it gross? It all goes down the drain? No different if you were to spit it in the basin and then someone wash their face in that basin a little later, as long as it's washed down what's the difference?", "Bloody hell this sub. What a bizarrely unnecessarily condescending way to type that.I swear this sub is populated by so many people who get off on being condescending, rude, and berating kids and young adults.

It\u2019s not necessary to shower every day.", "I practically raised the guy. I make him breakfast every morning and deal with his school stuff, make sure he\u2019s ready and out of the house on time. But now I understand that brushing in the shower isn\u2019t a big deal and I\u2019ll get over that. I guess I was just really heated when I wrote this post so now it sounds like I\u2019m a whiny brat lmao.", "Yeah 10 mins is a short shower.

That is a normal amount of time for regular washing.", "Yeah I didn\u2019t know a lot of people brushed their teeth in the shower, so that\u2019s something I won\u2019t have a problem with from now on.", "Brother doesn\u2019t suck", "Can you take your shower before him? Or wait 15 minutes after him?", "My guess is one of these things is going on with it:\n\n1. The water heater is too small for the house/number of people living there.\n\n2. The water heater is defective and isn\u2019t working properly.\n\n3. The water heater is old and dying.\n\nWith any of those above three options: You have to think that the parents\u2019 bathroom is also linked to this water heater (or they all use the same bathroom). If OP is the 3rd or 4th in line for the shower and they take showers one after the other with barely a break, then the water heater may not be able to keep up.\n\nEdit: there\u2019s a fourth option that I missed: the water heater isn\u2019t set properly, and the temperature setting may be too low.", "Right. At one point we had 7 people in my house(my wife and I with 5 kids) and have a 50 gallon water heater. Everyone got their showers without losing hot water", "Yes. Over time the usage of the water heater causes sediment to build up. Flushing the heater helps to keep the sediment from building up and causing corrosion to occur. This also helps to expand the lifespan of the heater a little bit. \nSomeone who is more trained in this area would be able to explain better.", "Yes, because sediment will settle in them.  It\u2019s a simple matter of draining it, refilling it, and repeat.", "Changing the temperature has nothing to do with how much hot water there is. Either the water heater is too small, or it's old and inefficient and not providing enough hot water. Sounds like your parents are TA for not dealing with it. Two teens in the house mean there's going to be a high demand on the hot water for a few years. \n\nAlso you have a teen brother, the less you think about what he's doing in the bathroom, or behind any closed door, the better.", "If you sleep in, expect a cold shower. If you really want the hot shower, you will get up earlier. NAH.", "Uh what? I don\u2019t get this. If you\u2019re classes start late, you can still get up and take a shower. I had morning classes everyday and I would wake up at 6:30 am to get a shower in. It\u2019s hard to get used to waking up at that time but one can definitely do it.", "So??? Your classes can start later but you can still set an alarm and get up to shower. It's not his job to adjust his schedule to yours", "Then that\u2019s on you.  10 minutes isn\u2019t long for a shower.", "So your brother has to change his regular schedule to accomodate your shifting schedule?\n\nINFO: why are your needs more important than his?

It all goes down the drain? No different if you were to spit it in the basin\n\nI meant gross as in not cleaning up after himself afterwards. Like brother spits out the toothpaste and it bounces to the walls and he leaves it like that without washing it away with water. Then that's a bit gross. \n\n\nThat's what I meant lol.", "Nearly 30? Oh well then get ready to fall off your high horse. \n\nPs. For us over 30, we are AHs and don't care. We also have no problem calling out other AHs too.

It's just what any elder sibling would do.", "I think that\u2019s awesome you do all that for him, I would have been lucky to have an older sibling like you. When you\u2019re having those heated moments, take 3 deep breaths and ask yourself if it\u2019s going to matter later.

I take cold showers though so maybe that's why.", "I can't cut down my shower to less than ten minutes and that's without shaving or doing any kind of skincare. I use a 2 in one shampoo and conditioner then I wash my body with whatever anti-allergy soap/ body wash I got then I'm out. That's my day to day. If I'm shaving too, that takes longer. I'm very fair so I don't need to shave as often", "Personally I warm up under the hot water for a couple of minutes, soap myself up using a sponge to get a nice foam, rinse everything off, possibly repeat the process if I've been working out hard or haven't showered for a while, massage conditioner into my hair, rinse it all out, shave body hair (which can take a *lot* of time depending on how many areas I'm doing), rinse everything again, dry off, get out.", "I have really thick hair, just washing it takes about five minutes if I actually want to get it clean because I have to section it out and wash each section individually and use my scalp scrubber/massager to get rid of any product buildup or natural oils. I always do that first, then I throw on my deep conditioning mask and let that sit while I do everything else (wash my face and body, exfoliate then shave, file my feet). I can keep it at around 10 minutes if I rush but anything less than that and not everything's getting clean which kind of defeats the purpose of showering imo.", "I was wondering about that too.   \n\n\nWhen camping there are often  coin op showers that are usually 3 minutes a coin.   \n\n\n3 minutes is generally fine and 6 minutes honestly gets a bit boring.  How much does each body part need to be scrubbed?", "Yeah Idk.. The whole situation is kinda weird.", "Well today I can wait cause my class starts later but for some reason the water pressure also gets weak and the water just becomes lukewarm not hot and it\u2019s something that happens consistently. When I wait it becomes hot again but not for long.", "OP, any chance the water pressure is too high?\n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s common, but I ran into that.   Also was seeing the hot water get used up much more quickly than expected, and a lower flow shower head didn\u2019t help much.  We\u2019re at the upper threshold of allowed water pressure in my city and have no good way to reduce that without spending a lot of money.  Any higher and the water utility would help reduce it, but we\u2019re on our own\n\nHowever I ordered online some cheap plastic flow restrictors and it made a huge difference.  They\u2019re just a plastic disk with a small opening to let less water through, that you put inside the shower head.  Normally that would make for unsatisfying showers but in my case it made for \u201cnormal\u201d showers and hot water that lasts much much longer - we went from ten minutes hot water to almost an hour", "I think you meant YTA", "I wake up at 6:00 am but sometimes (like today)  my class starts later so I wake up later and he gets ready first.", "lol maybe she doesn't like it when he brushes his teeth in there because it makes the shower tray slippery...", "Well at least you admit it!\n\nI know and work with plenty of sensible professional 40,50, 60 etc year olds who, so far as I can tell, are nothing like that though. So maybe try a better excuse. Whatever cheers you up and helps you get by I suppose. It seems a bit immature though honestly.", "Its not her responsibility though to be fair. She is doing him favours. Certainly dont shout at him, he\u2019s 13. 10 minutes isnt a long shower but if thats all the hot water they have its i considerate not to share it more equally. Sounds like they need a plumber more than anything though.", "Thank you \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udef6", "She's still an asshole for blaming her brother for it, when he is doing absolutely nothing wrong. She either has to speak to her parents and fix her bathroom or get up early instead of being lazy.", "I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t need that long, I\u2019m just baffled by it \ud83d\ude02 I don\u2019t care how long anyone else takes in the shower, it\u2019s just completely alien to me", "Huh, how do you not know? Brother is taking 10 minute showers and sister is complaining saying they are too long.\n\nHe\u2019s doing literally nothing wrong", "That\u2019s not his fault though. That\u2019s your parents not fixing the issue. 10mins isn\u2019t a long shower at all, it should not use up all the hot water. There\u2019s nothing wrong with brushing whilst showering too and if you\u2019re bothered about spit that gets washed away while showering then you may want to shower elsewhere as he washes his ass in there too! If it can\u2019t be fixed right now then you\u2019ve admitted you have options to have a hot shower but because you\u2019d rather stay in bed longer you end up with a warm shower instead. Again that\u2019s not your brothers problem, that\u2019s yours.", "Why can\u2019t you shower first?", "That's a pretty short shower & it sounds like you need to up the temp on your water heater and get a new shower head.", "Then shower before he does. Problem solved. \n10 minutes is not a long shower. I do agree on the brushing your teeth in there tho", "No - I meant NAH. They are young and they are siblings so I don't intend to get overly harsh. She's N T A for wanting a hot shower. I think OP is going about it the wrong way - but with age comes wisdom. I wish OP well.", "OP, that's a you problem. \n\nYour schedule change is not your 13yo brother's responsibility. Also, does this mean that on the days when you have earlier classes that your brother is the one who has to have the cold showers?", "How is that his fault? He has to wait till you wake up and shower and only then shower is it? Do you hear yourself? Are you 17 or 7?", "So if you\u2019re classes start later, why don\u2019t you hop in the shower first? You\u2019ll feel relaxed and won\u2019t have to worry about the wot water being luke warm temperature.", "Lol sure.", "I literally don't know anyone who takes less than ten minutes except teenage boys who don't know how to wash properly yet (looking at my brother for that one) lol or autistic friends who get sensory triggered by warm water. So, to me, it's baffling you can take less than that and still be clean", "I agree 10 minutes isn't long but it does suck that she's got barely any warm water left after he's done.\nMaybe there's a reason as to why she can't shower at night so it would be nice of him to shower 5 minutes less so she can have some hot water as well you know.", "And I'm sure pretty much every guy pees in the shower, too. I know I do most of the time.\n\nEdited to add there are other things that teenage boys do in the shower and the shower will be much longer than 10 minutes at that point.", "Im not sure he\u2019s never complained about the water being cold when I shower first. I\u2019ll ask him.", "Good response. No emojis this time? Gutted.", "Sure, but he still doesn\u2019t suck. \n\nIf anyone sucks its the parents for not resolving this issue before it got to this point. \n\n10 minutes is barely any time in the shower as it is (bet it\u2019s hard for the sister to get a shower in 10 minutes as well), and there\u2019s no reason it shouldn\u2019t have been fixed by now (it seems to be a long-term issue). The thing is too, the parents should also be the ones who helped designate a schedule if they 100% can\u2019t get it fixed rn.\n\nAlso, in the comments sister says she sometimes showers earlier because of her classes and she has hot water then, but when she has later classes he showers first. That kinda solidifies it for me that brother is NTA", "OK, forget about OP and her brother, Mikey3800 is TA", "Tbh I hope it is, then it's a case of whoever gets up late gets the cold shower - it's kinda fair that way. Natural consequences \ud83d\ude05", "I really do not give two shits about your opinion to be quite honest. \nGo and try to debate someone who cares.", "If you didn\u2019t care you wouldn\u2019t have replied to me 3 times \n\nlmfao what a weird and out of the blue reply\ud83d\ude02", "And blocked."]}
