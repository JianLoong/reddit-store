This issue is a lot more complex than I think you\u2019re letting yourself recognize. [Many (not all) wheelchair users, and others with disabilities, have negative reactions to \u201cbenign ableism\u201d and \u201cassumed incompetence.\u201d](https://www.disabledmagazine.online/holding-the-door-for-wheelchair-users-why-one-persons-nice-could-be-anothers-annoyance/) He wasn\u2019t upset that you were holding the door; he was upset that you apparently assumed he couldn\u2019t handle the situation on his own. He also couldn\u2019t be sure about your motivations or reactions, which could end up being dangerous for him. Let me explain:\n\nWhen you\u2019re disabled, you\u2019re subjected to a fuckton of resentment from a lot of people over things you can\u2019t do. Even the people who do help us sometimes expect dehumanizing levels of gratitude, or will \u201chelp\u201d us into a worse position than where we started, and there\u2019s no way for us to tell which type of stranger you are. So, when it comes to the things we *can* do, or *need* to do for ourselves to make sure they\u2019re done in a way that won\u2019t injure us further, we tend to guard that ability jealously, and often just say, \u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201d In all likelihood, his initial refusal was **not about you,** even if he may have said it too sharply. (How could it have been? He didn\u2019t know you.)\n\nYour response to what you perceived as rudeness was not to let the door go right away, but to wait until he was partially through, and then *strike him with it.* So, from his perspective, when he wasn\u2019t fawningly grateful for your white knight action, you physically struck him and left him trapped in a doorway. Good job. I\u2019m sure that will make him act much more polite in the future- no, wait, wait. It\u2019s actually going to do the opposite. In fact, *maybe* he treated you the way he did because he\u2019s experienced this **exact same bullshit before** from other people.\n\nNext time, ask. \u201cNeed help?\u201d And if they say no, even rudely, let them handle it themselves.", "Honestly even if someone didn\u2019t like that assistance there\u2019s a world of difference between saying \u201cI\u2019m alright thanks\u201d and cursing someone who was just being polite. NTA", "I'm a wheelchair user and whilst I do agree with you I will say that it gets frustrating at times when you have a day with several strangers that insist on helping you when you don't need it and like anyone, sometimes a bad day spills over into how we speak to overs. It's not an excuse but in my own experience it's perhaps a reason.  When I needed to rely on a wheelchair to get around the first thing I did was take an independent lesson from an experienced chair user in independent living skills. I can open a cafe  door and go through it , I can take my coffee to my table as I'm in a power chair now. I can move unneeded chairs out of my way etc.... But every so often you get someone that you politely say thank you but it's okay, I've got it! Thanks though! And they still try and take things off you, insist on 'helping' it's not malice it's from a good place but generally speaking if we say it's okay thanks I'm good, we mean it. It gets tiring having extra attention or being invisible. You end up forgetting what it's like to just be seen as equal by strangers", "Yeah assumed a lot of people were ready for that too, hence why I had to ask.", "Cursing and yelling at someone and saying\"thanks but no thanks\" are totally two different things. \nSounds like to me the guy was a jerk and allowing someone to just act like a jerk because they're in a wheelchair is ableism in itself.\n\nClearly you didn't read the post all the way through. The OP didn't wait for the man to go through and slam it on him. He said he didn't need help and then attempted to continue on after being so blatantly and unnecessarily rude. So OP just let the door go, they never said anything about slamming the door and trapping him.\n\n>In all likelihood, his initial refusal was not about you, even if he may have said it too sharply. (How could it have been? He didn\u2019t know you.)\n\nSo just because a person is a stranger it gives them the right to curse at them?", "Agreed! \ud83d\udc95", "I mean, holding a door open is something that strangers do for able-bodied people all the time.", "Absolutely. But I was just showing that in general sometimes these things build and when someone does something inocuous they take the brunt of it. Like I said not an excuse but a reason.

It\u2019s not worth the spew that falls out of their mouth", "I was raised to hold the door for someone entering or exiting through a door I just passed through. For me, it\u2019s not about the person being in a wheelchair. You were performing a courtesy that was standard in my upbringing and were yelled at for it. I say NTA, but in this situation, I\u2019ve always just apologized to the offended party, stating that\u2019s just how I was raised, asked if they\u2019d like to come in/leave, and complied with their wishes with a \u201chave a good one.\u201d", "NTA.", "NTA - I\u2019m from the south and I don\u2019t care who it is if I can see the whites of your eyes you\u2019re getting a door held open for you", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA I always hold the door for anyone behind or in front of me. Its just polite. You just gave him what he asked for. Hopefully he learned a lesson", "NTA. Problem solved then.", "YTA the disabled ass is just bitter about his situation and you should have taken the high road and to remind the you weren\u2019t helping rather than your were raised to have manners but if they prefer you can shit it so they could do it themselves", "I use forearm crutches and a walker. Not both at once, I mean. Depends on the day which I use. I only get mad when people insist on helping. And that doesn\u2019t include holding open the door. I\u2019ve had a couple sweet moments where I hold the door open for one person with a walker and then they hold the next one open for me. I am always grateful when people hold the door for me as even though I can often get it, sometimes I can\u2019t. Especially if the door opening button thingy is broken. \n\nI do mind when people insist. So for example: \u201cDo you need help?\u201d \u201cNope! I\u2019m good!\u201d If it ends there, great! But if someone keeps badgering me, then that is rude. Or worse, if they try to touch my mobility aid/grab something from my hands, or keep insisting on helping that is rude. \n\nAnyway. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  This guy sounds like a real piece of work.", "I hold the door for people as a courtesy. Have had a few women chastise me about it. Really ticks me off. \n\nThough twice I have gotten my own back and walked in front of then and farted. I'd normally hold it for when I'm outdoors, but crop dusting them gave me some great inner satisfaction.", "This exact same thing happened to me a couple of years ago!

There's a stereotype around this for a reason. I probably would have done the same tho tbh. NTA", "NTA. \n\nSounds like an issue with himself. Some disabled individuals don\u2019t like to be perceived as weak and take kind gestures as you pitying them or looking down on them. I think you closing the door on him is gonna be one of those things he never forgets. When you\u2019re rude to people, you get bad results.", "NTA, as a wheelchair user, he\u2019s probably just tired of pity and saw it as pity whether or not you intended it. I wouldn\u2019t take it to heart at all. However, I don\u2019t know what else he expected you to do after that outburst. If you kept holding it he would have also been angry.

I\u2019m in a wheelchair and I usually just go with \u201cthank you!\u201d Sure, I can do it myself, but it\u2019s easier if I let someone else be kind. Honestly even if they\u2019re doing it out of pity, we\u2019re both going to move on and likely never see each other again, why should I bother being offended by a strangers pity? Still saved me the energy of pushing open a heavy ass door.\n\nPeople in wheelchairs can still be AHs and you shouldn\u2019t be expected to be the bigger person if you wouldn\u2019t have in the same situation with an able bodied person \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Honestly I feel the guy.

I barely can leave the house and when I do I want to retain any degree of independence I got.

I think it\u2019s more of a fluke than anything. Although when you\u2019re \u201chelping\u201d by touching someone\u2019s mobility aid in anyway that\u2019s a completely different story. Even if someone looks like they\u2019re struggling always ask before helping.", "Yeah that\u2019s what I do, although as a woman in the south I\u2019m used to people holding doors for me regardless so that\u2019s never really been an issue for me.

And no, it isnjust one block. The entire area is the same, including the malls there", "Yeah, I worked with someone wheelchair bound and only one time I touched his chair and that was when he couldn't get the right angle to pass through his office door (it was a motorized chair) other than that though I figured if he needed help with something he'd ask for it.", "Right, if he had said \u201cnah man I got the door for myself\u201d this post would have never been made and OP would have forgotten about it by now.", ">You end up forgetting what it's like to just be seen as equal by strangers\n\nI mean, r/herecomesthesun000 admits as much but is giving their perspective on how it can be seen differently on a bad day.", "I feel like this would also apply as malicious compliance.

They just feel entitled and expect it.\n\nSadly in this area i stopped opening the door. But in other areas this is the attitude I see where its just polite to hold it open. You say thanks and that's it.", "Whenever I hold a door open for someone, it's just to be nice. Others have done it for me countless times and it's always appreciated, why not return a kind gesture to someone I'll never see again? It's so simple, you just hold a door open for someone since it's already opened, disabled or not. \n\nI'd figure if someone was in a wheelchair or using crutches then that's just good manners to hold the door", "It depends on the situation, in this case it makes no sense. But some people will hold open the door even if you aren't no way near the door which I find annoying since then I have to speed walk because I'm not expecting them to hold open the door for a few seconds and if I don't hurry I feel bad but then I'm in pain (cjronic joint pain). In those circumstances it's understandable to be annoyed.", "As a woman, I don't get offended if men hold the door open for me.

The times when I've had to use a walker I've been *thrilled* when someone held the door for me and I've thanked them, not cursed them.\n\nHowever, I think his response (as over the top as it was) has more to do with how he feels about being in a wheelchair than your actions.\n\nBut still, I'm not sure what he expected would happen when he told you he didn't need your help.\n\nEdited for clarification", "NTA", "NTA   \n\ud83c\udfb5 *Be careful what you wish for or you just might get it* \ud83c\udfb5", "NTA. \n\nPlay silly games get silly prizes.", "NTA. \n\nI've had a similar thing happen many years ago when I was a senior in high school, my teacher gave us a \"mission\" to go outside to the playing field,  collect some things and hurry back, but to turn in our assignment first. \n\nI asked my group if they wanted me to turn in their assignment and they could go on, three of the guys said yes but Jose who is a wheelchair user told me \" no I don't need your help, I'm capable of doing things myself\" I told him it wasn't about me taking pity just trying to be nice.  \n\nWell we all go outside,  collect our stuff and I'm running back to class and I hear a \"hey\" being me and it's Jose and he asks me to help push him back to class because he's going to be the last one back. I told him \" oh I thought you didn't need any help with doing things\" he just started mumbling about something but I still helped him out. \n\nI just find it annoying when some people find it so offensive to a offer of help.

So, you treated him like anyone else being an asshole.\n\nIf there was a guy walking behind you, you would have held the door, right?

I know I should be grateful for their kindness, but I always felt like the guy in the story. In my head, I was muttering \"I can open the damned door myself, thank you!\" (I was in my 20s, very independent, and not accustomed to asking for help.)\n\nBut unlike the guy in the story, I understood that people were being nice to me, so I let them hold the door and thanked them for it.", "NTA.", "NTA.... being polite and then having someone being rude in return based on some imagined, perceived slight is a huge pet peeve of mine.", "NTA.\n\nFuck that guy.

That person has likely suffered either immediately, or lifelong from people treating them as \"less than\", or \"invalid\". It's not about your action, it's not that you were being rude or attempting to do this, but moreover that this person is used to being put into that place, and it hurts; it's somewhat dehumanizing to be treated as \"less than\". \n\nI'm heartbroken that normal interactions are misconstrued this way, but it's about that persons experience and life, not you.\n\na P.S. You likewise did not deserve the verbal abuse as a result of this, no matter what that persons life is like; their experience is not your responsibility. For that I'm very sorry, you didn't deserve that. Don't internalize this interaction as being about you though. Keep being you.", "I wrote this as a response to someone else but decided to put it on its own when it got long. NTA OP. Society is the AH, just keep being nice it's not you. If you're looking for alternative options, sometimes when I'm walking and the person behind me is in a wheelchair, I'll ask if they would like me to grab the door or if I can pass them the handle. If there's a blue button, I let the door shut completely so they can use the button. But I honestly get why that guy did that. I might have done it too \n\n\nI have invisible disabilities myself & use a variety of mobility aids, mostly cane and rollator right now, but my biggest goal is my very own custom electric chair for my shoulders since regular wheelchairs now aggravate my torn shoulders, yet I'm often in one. I'd like to offer another perspective\n\nTbh, I'll never stop being the asshole that refuses to go through the held open door when I'm in a chair alone and I don't care. Too many people just grab you by the wheelchair back once you're through the door and try to move you out of their way. Either that or you can get followed/prayed over/mugged etc. The people who are watching everyone walk in go: \"ohhh shiny, an easy mark! The purse is even on the back!! \"\nWhen I had to do Evangelical stuff as a kid my church often went to places like mall entrances to wait, watch, and be able to proselytize to the same person multiple times as they went through the mall (hopefully before they spend all their money). My church grandmas loved to tell us to target people that look like me because they try to promise \"healing\" so they think they can convince me to give the church my money/time easier. \n I'm not trying to find out who's resentful for holding a door for longer or who decides I'm an easy fun target for stealing or videos. Until I can be sure I'm not inviting violations of my bodily autonomy from randos that everyone else will defend as \"nice\" I'm not gonna be like 'oh thanks bro' \n\nIt feels safer to be pissed at people in general so they leave you alone vs thinking of \"funny\" things to do to you. I can't be like \"oh why thank you sir\" to each and every one to individually deal with each of their reactions or shake them following me, try to get them to stop praying over me etc. I can do my best to decern or bring my partner etc, but it's not worth my day and mental health to be wrong again. \n\nLast time, a guy stood around and argued he should be able to pray over me for a long time just standing there, blocking our cart path in the grocery store. But he sees my knee braces so he thinks I can't run away from him.", "I'm an older woman with mobility issues but even I will hold the door to my block of flats wide open if I see a neighbour, even if younger & healthy, coming up behind me with a ton of shopping. It's just consideration for another human being as all it takes is 10-20 seconds of my time and it saves them having to scramble for their keys & possibly dropping their heavy shopping. Holding doors for others who may be struggling is just a little human kindness to help things run a little smoother. We *all* benefit from that.", "Exactly.  I'm a wheelchair user and I'm absolutely delighted when anyone holds a door open, moves something out my way or does anything to make my journey easier. The least I can do is thank them, not curse them.", "Agreed, I'll hold a door open for anyone, I don't care who they are.\n\nUnless I know them, in which case I'll hold it open early just to see how far away I can make them do that awkward jog from to not make me wait too long.", "Because people with disabilities, like everyone else, are allowed to have bad days where they are just angry at the world, and sometimes that means the people trying to help them. And if I had to wager, I'd guess people with disabilities have a lot more reason than most to be angry with the world. It's not personal. But in the same way that I don't internalize the anger from the asshole flipping me off in traffic, I don't internalize other people's bad day feelings in person either. \n\nIt's not all disabled people, but since we so rarely see people with disabilities out and about in the US, especially outside of major cities, it is easy to use one person as an example for the whole lived experience. I bet you hold the door open for people with disabilities all of the time, you just might not remember it or even see their invisible disability.", "I've heard of people insisting on \"helping\" disabled people often in ways that are actually more of a hassle.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if this guy has dealt with people who have been very unhelpful in their help, but he still needed to expect exactly this response to being yelled at for helping", "Agreed. I hold the door for everybody, young, old, male female. I've seen women hold it for women and men hold it for men. That specific person was just bitter. Some people are. I've been snapped at by people I've held the door for. It's about 5 percent bitter, 5 percent not paying attention and 90 percent nice.", "I\u2019m going to add a slightly different take. I had invisible disabilities and couldn\u2019t walk very far. I frequently ended up in a wheelchair or cart. I was very young and appeared healthy. When I first had to accept that I was ill I had a hard time accepting peoples help, because until now I could it myself. I won\u2019t give the man a pass because he could have been pissed in silence but I will say to those caught in that situation, give a little grace, there are battles you can\u2019t see.", "That's funny coming from a joke of a wasteman.", "There are some people who treat us like children. Don't assume we need help carrying things, picking things up or can't complete a task. I had a family member who would never walk in front of me, always behind me because he thought I couldn't navigate walking in crowds with my cane. I have had people try to help me take off my coat because they thought it would be \"hard to do with a cane and a purse\". Some people change their voices as if they are talking to a child. I used to have people who would not invite me places because they assumed it was something I couldn't handle. When I have had to use a wheelchair folks think it's ok to lean on the chair or even push me even though I didn't need to go anywhere. Moral of the story is treat everyone as if they are able bodied until they ask for assistance with something specific. Most of us have found ways to cope and have tricks to help us with our daily lives, we don't need able bodied people to \"make it easier\" or feel sorry for us. Holding a door is acceptable because most people hold doors for others (I don't know why the dude in the post went off, he's likely been dealing with the grief that comes along with losing mobility). Saying hello and acknowledging people as people and not their disability is the best approach.", "People routinely talk to someone who might be with me instead of to me. They will tell me how amazing/inspiring/proud of me they are because I\u2019m out shopping. People will move my wheelchair if Im in their way instead of asking me to move. Basically just assume Im on my legs and don\u2019t treat me any differently. You wouldn\u2019t assume I can\u2019t speak for myself otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t tell me im an inspiration (so gross) and you wouldn\u2019t push me out of the way.", ">It gets tiring having extra attention or being invisible\n\nIsn\u2019t being invisible, a.k.a being treated like every other able bodied person out there, what most disabled people say they want?

People aren't necessarily targeting you as someone that needs your help and doing it purely becauae they were raised to hold the door open.\n\n\nThe other stuff though with insisting on helping with stuff that's far beyond a polite door holding, is not cool though and can absolutely come across as offensive even though I'm sure that's not their intention.  If someone looks like they're struggling, dropping things, I will ASK if I can help them but definitely don't make assumptions about their abilities and need for assistance.

There is no eye-to-eye on the same level so they feel like they cannot level with them, or they feel weird about interacting with them, and they end up leaving wheelchair users to others to interact with even in situations where they themselves would have interacted had the wheelchair not been there.\n\nI imagine it is comparable to the issue women have with men paying too much attention to them just because they are physically attractive or treating them like idiots because clearly they can't use their braincells because they are pleasing to the eyes. Anyone likes a compliment, but there needs to be a good reason or it will just sound creepy. Picking the right moment for a compliment is another important factor that determines whether it will be received well.\n\nI can't imagine how frustrating it must be to always get special treatment from strangers that effectively reduces your existence to the sum total of the first impression you give them and are unable to change in any meaningful way.", "If you have an invisible disability, some people will not believe you're \"really disabled\", so they might shame you for using accommodations you genuinely need.", "He didn\u2019t expect her to thank him.
