This issue is a lot more complex than I think you\u2019re letting yourself recognize. [Many (not all) wheelchair users, and others with disabilities, have negative reactions to \u201cbenign ableism\u201d and \u201cassumed incompetence.\u201d](https://www.disabledmagazine.online/holding-the-door-for-wheelchair-users-why-one-persons-nice-could-be-anothers-annoyance/) He wasn\u2019t upset that you were holding the door; he was upset that you apparently assumed he couldn\u2019t handle the situation on his own. He also couldn\u2019t be sure about your motivations or reactions, which could end up being dangerous for him. Let me explain:\n\nWhen you\u2019re disabled, you\u2019re subjected to a fuckton of resentment from a lot of people over things you can\u2019t do. Even the people who do help us sometimes expect dehumanizing levels of gratitude, or will \u201chelp\u201d us into a worse position than where we started, and there\u2019s no way for us to tell which type of stranger you are. So, when it comes to the things we *can* do, or *need* to do for ourselves to make sure they\u2019re done in a way that won\u2019t injure us further, we tend to guard that ability jealously, and often just say, \u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201d In all likelihood, his initial refusal was **not about you,** even if he may have said it too sharply. (How could it have been? He didn\u2019t know you.)\n\nYour response to what you perceived as rudeness was not to let the door go right away, but to wait until he was partially through, and then *strike him with it.* So, from his perspective, when he wasn\u2019t fawningly grateful for your white knight action, you physically struck him and left him trapped in a doorway. Good job. I\u2019m sure that will make him act much more polite in the future- no, wait, wait. It\u2019s actually going to do the opposite. In fact, *maybe* he treated you the way he did because he\u2019s experienced this **exact same bullshit before** from other people.\n\nNext time, ask. \u201cNeed help?\u201d And if they say no, even rudely, let them handle it themselves.", "Honestly even if someone didn\u2019t like that assistance there\u2019s a world of difference between saying \u201cI\u2019m alright thanks\u201d and cursing someone who was just being polite. NTA", "I'm a wheelchair user and whilst I do agree with you I will say that it gets frustrating at times when you have a day with several strangers that they to insist on helping you when you don't need it and life anyone, sometimes a bad day spills over into how we speak to overs. It's not an excuse but in my own experience it's perhaps a reason.  When I needed to rely on a wheelchair to get around the first thing I did was take an independent lesson from an experienced chair user in independent living skills. I can open a cafe  door and go through it , I can take my coffee to my table as I'm in a power hair now. I can move unneeded chairs out of my way etc.... But evert so often you get someone that you politely say thank you but it's okay, I've got it! Thanks though! And they still try and take things off you, insist on 'helping' it's not malice it's from a good place but generally speaking if we say it's okay thanks I'm good, we mean it. It gets tiring having extra attention or being invisible. You end up forgetting what it's like to just be seen as equal by strangers", "Yeah assumed a lot of people were ready for that too, hence why I had to ask.", "Cursing and yelling at someone and saying\"thanks but no thanks\" are totally two different things. \nSounds like to me the guy was a jerk and allowing someone to just act like a jerk because they're in a wheelchair is ableism in itself.\n\nClearly you didn't read the post all the way through. The OP didn't wait for the man to go through and slam it on him. He said he didn't need help and then attempted to continue on after being so blatantly and unnecessarily rude. So OP just let the door go, they never said anything about slamming the door and trapping him.\n\n>In all likelihood, his initial refusal was not about you, even if he may have said it too sharply. (How could it have been? He didn\u2019t know you.)\n\nSo just because a person is a stranger it gives them the right to curse at them?", "Agreed! \ud83d\udc95", "I mean, holding a door open is something that strangers do for able-bodied people all the time.", "Absolutely. But I was just showing that in general sometimes these things build and when someone does something inocuous they take the brunt of it. Like I said not an excuse but a reason. He could have been in a really high pain day or been patronised recently and just took it out on OP which was wrong , rude and uncalled for.", "I work at a gas station and I\u2019ve tried opening doors for those in wheelchairs or using walkers \nThey always get pissed and talk shit so i stopped \n\nEven when i see them eying a beer above their reach. It\u2019s not worth the spew that falls out of their mouth", "I was raised to hold the door for someone entering or exiting through a door I just passed through. For me, it\u2019s not about the person being in a wheelchair. You were performing a courtesy that was standard in my upbringing and were yelled at for it. I say NTA, but in this situation, I\u2019ve always just apologized to the offended party, stating that\u2019s just how I was raised, asked if they\u2019d like to come in/leave, and complied with their wishes with a \u201chave a good one.\u201d", "NTA.", "NTA - I\u2019m from the south and I don\u2019t care who it is if I can see the whites of your eyes you\u2019re getting a door held open for you", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA I always hold the door for anyone behind or in front of me. Its just polite. You just gave him what he asked for. Hopefully he learned a lesson", "NTA. Problem solved then.", "YTA the disabled ass is just bitter about his situation and you should have taken the high road and to remind the you weren\u2019t helping rather than your were raised to have manners but if they prefer you can shit it so they could do it themselves", "I use forearm crutches and a walker. Not both at once, I mean. Depends on the day which I use. I only get mad when people insist on helping. And that doesn\u2019t include holding open the door. I\u2019ve had a couple sweet moments where I hold the door open for one person with a walker and then they hold the next one open for me. I am always grateful when people hold the door for me as even though I can often get it, sometimes I can\u2019t. Especially if the door opening button thingy is broken. \n\nI do mind when people insist. So for example: \u201cDo you need help?\u201d \u201cNope! I\u2019m good!\u201d If it ends there, great! But if someone keeps badgering me, then that is rude. Or worse, if they try to touch my mobility aid/grab something from my hands, or keep insisting on helping that is rude. \n\nAnyway. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  This guy sounds like a real piece of work.", "I hold the door for people as a courtesy. Have had a few women chastise me about it. Really ticks me off. \n\nThough twice I have gotten my own back and walked in front of then and farted. I'd normally hold it for when I'm outdoors, but crop dusting them gave me some great inner satisfaction.", "This exact same thing happened to me a couple of years ago!

Some people just want to bitch.  He bitched when you held the door, he bitched more when you let it go.  Likely mental health issues to go along with using a chair.\n\nThanks for trying to be a kind & helpful person.  Sorry for the crazy.", "Man he would hate living in Canada. There's a stereotype around this for a reason. I probably would have done the same tho tbh. NTA", "NTA. \n\nSounds like an issue with himself. Some disabled individuals don\u2019t like to be perceived as weak and take kind gestures as you pitying them or looking down on them. I think you closing the door on him is gonna be one of those things he never forgets. When you\u2019re rude to people, you get bad results.", "NTA, as a wheelchair user, he\u2019s probably just tired of pity and saw it as pity whether or not you intended it. I wouldn\u2019t take it to heart at all. However, I don\u2019t know what else he expected you to do after that outburst. If you kept holding it he would have also been angry. Damned if you do damned if you don\u2019t.", "Lmao NTA. Sounds a lot like he fucked around and found out. Begging chooser lookin ass.", "NTA. I\u2019m in a wheelchair and I usually just go with \u201cthank you!\u201d Sure, I can do it myself, but it\u2019s easier if I let someone else be kind. Honestly even if they\u2019re doing it out of pity, we\u2019re both going to move on and likely never see each other again, why should I bother being offended by a strangers pity? Still saved me the energy of pushing open a heavy ass door.\n\nPeople in wheelchairs can still be AHs and you shouldn\u2019t be expected to be the bigger person if you wouldn\u2019t have in the same situation with an able bodied person \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Honestly I feel the guy. I use a chair and I\u2019d literally rather be stuck outside a store fighting with the door then be helped. I barely can leave the house and when I do I want to retain any degree of independence I got.

I think it\u2019s more of a fluke than anything. Although when you\u2019re \u201chelping\u201d by touching someone\u2019s mobility aid in anyway that\u2019s a completely different story. Even if someone looks like they\u2019re struggling always ask before helping.", "Yeah that\u2019s what I do, although as a woman in the south I\u2019m used to people holding doors for me regardless so that\u2019s never really been an issue for me. But when it comes to reaching something or putting something away for me I just say \u201cOh I\u2019ve got it.\u201d And it\u2019s never been an issue.", "Can you provide some insight into what ableist BS we may mindlessly be doing?

I have also lived in neighbourhoods ehere they quickly click the lift door shut the moment they spot anyone else moving towards it. Guess which neighbourhood I moved out of. And no, it isnjust one block. The entire area is the same, including the malls there", "Yeah, I worked with someone wheelchair bound and only one time I touched his chair and that was when he couldn't get the right angle to pass through his office door (it was a motorized chair) other than that though I figured if he needed help with something he'd ask for it.", "Right, if he had said \u201cnah man I got the door for myself\u201d this post would have never been made and OP would have forgotten about it by now.", ">You end up forgetting what it's like to just be seen as equal by strangers\n\nI mean, r/herecomesthesun000 admits as much but is giving their perspective on how it can be seen differently on a bad day."]}
