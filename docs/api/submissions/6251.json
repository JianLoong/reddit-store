He said it himself,  I dont need your (colourful language insert) help...", "NTA- I\u2019ve had someone do this to me too. Said \u201cfine fuck it\u201d and pulled the door all the way closed behind me.", "NTA. \n\nHe acted like a jerk and got what he deserved.", "NTA Petty? Definitely. An asshole? Nope. I can kinda understand why he would be upset, as having a disability can make any small act of kindness feel like other people are looking down on you, BUT that doesn't mean you should be taking it out on random strangers.", "NTA. Wheelchair user here. I appreciate it when someone offers to hold the door open for me. He said quite rudely that he was capable. Your response was perfect.", "NTA... I think you were in a lose-lose situation. He berated you for holding the door open. He berated you for closing it.  \n\nYou could have taken the high road and continued to hold it open. But I think many people would have been so surprised they would have done the same thing.", "Nta, he said he didn't need your help.", "NTA, he chose this for himself", "NTA-I use a wheelchair and if I didn\u2019t want or need your help I would have declined politely. If he wants to act like an asshole there\u2019s nothing wrong with allowing him to experience the consequences of his actions.", "Why Would you even need to ask this NTA 100% if you don\u2019t need my help you don\u2019t need to yell at me I would have slammed the door in his face", "Obviously NTA if dude reacted like that. I would\u2019ve let the door go to. Some people just like being mean and stirring up crap. \nDon\u2019t let this one bad interaction stop you from doing good in the future though. Most people would\u2019ve been grateful!", "NTA; the disabled man said he didn't want any help, so you stopped attempting to give him help. It sounds like he's just one of those people who aren't satisfied with getting help and mad when they don't get it.", "NTA. Wheelchair user myself. We get a lot of ableist bullshit but holding the door open is something people do for people who walk too. He got what he asked for. Karma is a bitch", "NTA, I really don't understand why some disabled people get so bent out of shape for something as normal as holding the door for them.  99% of the people who are holding the door aren't doing it because you're disabled, they're doing it because they were taught to hold the door for other people coming in that are near you because it's the polite thing to do.  Everyone should know this because it's so common in society but it's like disabled people don't know that's a courteous thing to do and just assume it's done out of pity or some other form on condescending attitude.", "Dude, I had the exact same thing happen to me, except it was a guy trying to maneuver his bike through the door rather than a person in a wheelchair.

I win you 4th grade reading level looking mf\u2019s. Fuck this thread.

If you imagine he wasn't in a wheelchair and you now think NTA, maybe you should rethink your thought process on this because being overly sympathetic is to some people almost as bad as being discriminatory because you're setting them aside", "Enh maybe. That\u2019s debatable, circumstantial, and arguably inconsequential though. All I can say is I\u2019d feel like a total P.O.S. if I chose to 1-Up some dude in a wheelchair over such a trivial thing. Hard to imagine being proud of something like that."]}
