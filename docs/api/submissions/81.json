We moved to a new town too far away from her previous pediatrician so I began looking for a new one. \n\nFor some context, MIL works in the medical field and is very opinionated about different medical groups (seaton vs providence vs whoever) and thinks any doctor or office under a different group is horrible and you should never go there. She has no facts, just opinions on who she likes more. As she is in the medical field I valued her opinion and tried to find a pediatrician under her preferred group, but the only one in the area that had good reviews wasn\u2019t taking new patients. \n\nWhen MIL heard this she told me to take my baby to her personal doctor, not a pediatrician but he will take babies. I would rather my baby go to a pediatrician so I decided to go with a pediatrician office under a different group and it hurt her a lot. She acted pretty offended by even considering them, let alone scheduling an appointment. She\u2019s never even set foot in that office and knows nothing about them. \n\nI feel bad for upsetting her, and as she knows more about this than I do, maybe I should have gone with someone she recommended. AITA?\n\nEdited for formatting.\n\nUpdate: Thanks for the responses. My fianc\u00e9 works a lot and asked me to handle setting up a doctor since I\u2019m not working. He is in agreement with me. I spoke with MIL about how I felt and that while I appreciate her recommendation I\u2019ll make the choice I feel is best, as her mom, and that as her mom all medical decisions will be up to me and my fianc\u00e9. She apologized for how she acted and agreed I need to make the choice I felt was best.", "created_utc": 1667232905, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yigh4v/aita_for_choosing_a_pediatrician_other_than_the/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She wanted to force a less qualified doctor on you for literally no reason other than she's a control freak. \n\nShine up your spine and stop making yourself responsible for unreasonable people's feelings. You're doing right by your kid and that's all that matters here. Her feelings are her own to manage.\n\nAnd where is your husband in this? He needs to tell his mom to butt out and stop making your life difficult.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Honestly, I would steer clear of any office she\u2019s affiliated with; I wouldn\u2019t trust her not to try and use her personal relationships to try and completely bulldoze doctor-patient confidentiality, given how overbearing she\u2019s being that you *must* listen to her and do things her way before you\u2019ve even gotten a foot in the door.", "Absolutely NTA, you know whats best for your child, you did your research and it gave you a good feeling. My advice is that you set boundaries with her, she can advise but not take over . She needs to get over her wants and focus on whats the best for your baby.", "NTA - you need to stop relying on MIL for medical advice.  Just because she is in the medical field doesn\u2019t mean that she knows everyone or everything.  You need to do your own research and follow your gut on the decisions.  Do not give up your power over your child.  She wants you to do what she wants because she wants to control you and the baby.  She wants to be In the know and the goto person.  This will undermine your confidence in doing what you believe is best for your child.\n\nAs a general rule, do not ever go to the same doctor or doctors office as your MIL.  She will use her influence to get around HIPAA rules to know what is going on with your child.\n\nYou need to stop going to her for advice.  You can do this.  Unless your child had serious medical issues, finding a pediatrician with good reviews is fine for your child.  You need to develop your own self confidence that you know what is best for your child.  Stop feeling bad for upsetting her.  This is your child, you are the momma, you make the decisions.  She is overstepping by telling you who you should see and then being upset when you don\u2019t take her advice.  Actually it wasn\u2019t advice if she is upset, it was a command and you didn\u2019t obey.\n\nLots of people have opinions\u2026 people in the medical field can have opinions based on actual information.  I got great recommendations from my gp on a specialist I needed to see because my gp had experience with that particular doc.  It wasn\u2019t hearsay and rumors.  I would be that your MIL is making stuff up to drive you to using her docs\u2026\n\nFYI - her role should be that of a spectator in your life.  She raised her kids, they are now adults.  She is no longer on the playing field, she is in the stands cheering on her favorite team.  You, your husband, and your child are on the field playing the game of life.  If you let the spectators guide you, how likely are you to do well?? You will start second guessing yourself, etc.  that\u2019s why players on the field tune out the spectators.  They wave and thumbs up the fans so as not to insult them, but they tune out their advice and go with their own game plan.", "NTA if you want to go to a pediatrician with your baby that is your prerogative. Don\u2019t let her guilt trip you.", "NTA. Her response to your decision is ridiculous. Is she this controlling about everything else?", "NTA it sounds like she\u2019s taking a commercial rivalry a little too seriously.", "NTA - keep medical and family away from each other.", "NTA and you shouldn't feel badly at all. It's your choice, and its who YOU feel most comfortable with. The thing is, parenting you learn as you go, so let's say you don't care for the dr. you chose. you are free to choose another! Your MIL's preferences or supposed knowledge should have NO bearing at all on what you think is best for your child. She has no say, and if she's upset, well, that's on her. Don't give into her; do what you feel is best.", "NTA. But you are a mom now. You HAVE to advocate for your children. Their need for your advocacy outweighs your need not to be comfortable with confrontation.", "NTA\nyour baby, not hers", "NTA - this is your kid ergo your decision.", "NTA- you can choose to take your baby to who you want.  In fact id turn it around on MIL.  Tell her, \"it seems youre upset about the decision i made to have my baby see Dr. X.  I hope that does not change how you express other opinions/advice to me in the future.  I value your opinion but i still like to make my own choices.  I hope you can respect that\"  She needs to understand boundaries.", "NTA.  I am surprised her regular physician would even accept a baby as a patient.  Baby medical needs are vastly different from adults which is why it is a specialty.  Your baby needs a pediatrician - don't let MIL beat you up on this.  Establish boundaries now.", "INFO: What do you mean she is in the medical profession? Is she a doctor?\n\nIf not then her opinion on this doesnt matter. Your child needs a specialist doctor - a paediatrician. Its your child, she had her own and raised them, she wants more she can adopt. Also she suggested a family practice -does she have access to the records, would she use her relationship to find out information? There should be a separation for someone being this controlling.\n\nTell her you operate on facts, like doctors do, when she  gives you facts you will follow it.  And in any case the doctor wasnt taking new patients so you will go for a doc in another group until the other doc starts taking on new patients.", "Nta.  Your kid, your choice.  There are good reasons to choose an experienced pediatrician.\n\nMy father was in the Air Force reserves my whole childhood.  \n\nAn AF doctor retired due to throat cancer and settled in my home town a little before my brother and I were born.  He was old, and voice was raspy, and I was a little scared of him.   The pediatrician across town had a merry go round in her office.  I always wanted to go there but my dad insisted we go to Dr. Cook unless Dr. Cook wasn't available that day.  95% of my healthcare was with Dr. Cook.\n\nI was a kid who got sick every week or two.  I was prescribed antibiotics about twice a month.  Upper respiratory infections, tonsillitis, congestion, sinus, bronchitis, sore throat, fever.  I got the same type of infection over and over.  My weight ballooned, I wasn't physically active because I was always sick, and the antibiotics did something to make my digestive system unhealthy.  (Overuse of antibiotics wasn't understood then.)\nMy tonsils were removed and grew back.\n\nWhen I was 14, the doctor's receptionist Betty (not nurse, not medical staff, just the woman answering the phone and checking people in) read an article about people with symptoms like mine. She took the magazine to work and saved it for the next time I came in and gave it to Mom (Good Housekeeping or similar, not a medical journal).\n\nThe article was about allergies.  They talked about allergy shots and allergy pills.\n\nMy mom was excited about this.  They were spending a thousand dollars a year on my healthcare before the insurance kicked in, plus missing work.  A treatment would improve her life a lot.\n\nShe was excited when she asked Dr. Cook if I could have allergies.  He said \"Of course\" like it was an obvious reality, a fact he had known.  Mom was angry he never said a word about it before now. \n\nMom put her foot down at that point and we stopped seeing Dr. Cook unless the pediatrician was out of town.  Sadly, the Merry Go Round and other toys were now too small for me...but the pediatrician got me started on antihistamines and referred me to an allergist 75 miles away who started me on allergy shots.  \n\nI am a 47f and Dr. Cook died when I was in my 20s.  I never had a chance to call out his incompetency or write a scathing review.  \n\nI am absolutely certain the pediatrician would have recognized the allergies of she had seen me more than once every year or two when I was little.  I wouldn't have missed the parties, school, trips to the mall, and fun events because I was sick.  \n\nDon't take your child to a nonspecialist.  Find a pediatrician with good reviews and stick with that person.", "NTA. Don t feel badly.    She is free to make suggestions but only an ah would insist.   So the bigger deal she makes out of things, the more comfortable you should be that you made the right choice.  She needs to respect your boundaries.  \n\nBut consider this a warning and try not to involve her too much in decisions.  And move out as quickly as you can.  Some people are easier to love at a distance.  If she is pushy and you feel guilty easily, this relationship will be stressful when you need to focus on your new baby and husband instead.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
