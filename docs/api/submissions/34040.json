It does not mean I wasn't an asshole. And what you said was definitely asshole territory. I'm not going to give useless advice about how to deal with your bullies because it is rarely something you can fix yourself and it varies immensely on the actual person doing the bullying. But making jokes about being fat is always gross behaviour, making dead mum jokes is a minefield that you cannot cross unless you've got a dead mum yourself (and even then it is an incredibly delicate arena and I would never make dead parent jokes towards any of my friends who have lost a parent. It is my coping mechanism for myself but I would never poke fun at my friends losses. I don't even make those jokes around my sister and very cautiously around my brother) and a lot of folks will take her side over yours if she makes a fuss about it which is just going to make it worse for you.", "NTA. \n\nDon't give it if you can't take it.

That ghoul shouldn't be dishing it out if she can't handle getting it in return.", "While it was a low blow, you can't expect immunity from what you're dishing out. She mocked you for something you can't control, you did it back. Maybe she will learn from this that words hurt. It is sad that her mother died, but she can't hide behind that to bully you and your friends.", "NTA. Next time they bully you do it again. Until they stop bullying you.", "NTA. Don\u2019t dish it out if you can\u2019t take it. She started it, and yes, that does mean something especially in the grown up world.\n\nHowever, if you do anything like that again unprovoked, then you would be TA.", "based honestly", "NTA. Bullies don't stop hitting you until you hit back. Hopefully the pain you threw at her will make her reconsider next time.\n\nOtherwise, well... Her dead mum is basically a silver bullet to use whenever she tries to verbally abuse you.", "NTA. It serves her right for being that rude .", "NTA !!  She\u2019s a typical bully who can give it out but can\u2019t take it !!", "Karma's a bitch and fun to watch. Op NTA. Life pro tip always find the weakness of your opponent and exploit it.", "ESH - because everyone does suck here. It was funny though, and little Miss Ableist shouldn't dish out what she can't take. As others have mentioned, bullies typically don't stop until they've had a taste of their own medicine.", "NTA or maybe a justified AH. These girls followed you-so they went out of their way-to harass you. They hit low and you hit back. Was it right? No. But what are you supposed to do?

You're allowed to serve smack backs to bullys", "They're bullying you.\n\nIf they can't deal with you returning the favor, then they should shut up and stop harassing you.\n\nNTA\n\nThis also doesn't read like something a 14 year old would write. Too sophisticated.", "NTA. Bullies deserve to be punished and you handled it exceptionally well.

I wish I\u2019d been a bit more confrontational with people. They were the same size as me and not a threat so I had nothing to lose.
