Why should you help them if they are not using the money for good use - bills/food? I don't get this culture to not work but try to sponge on family members who live abroad. \n\nMaybe talk to your wife so you are on the same page. If there are family members who really need money (because single parent, old and sick or so), you could still send them money but only if they agree not to tell the leeches.", "NTA - The family abroad has now gotten used to you sending money to them as their foreign sugar daddy and mommy.  Nip that in the bud right now. Tell them that from now on, don't ask.  You will send what you think you can afford at any given time and that's it.  You are not responsible for their finances.  Get another job if you truly need more money is what you should say to them.  Your family comes first before them anyways.", "NTA\n\nI live in Latin America and converting the $1000.... is enough to support a family of at least 3 people in a medium-sized city. It's insane that they're asking for that much money. \n\nIt's time to have a conversation with your wife about what type of help you two are going to offer and to who you will offer. I think that a more concrete help is the right approach here: help exclusively her parents from now on, pay directly their bills (light, water, insurance), you can buy food for them through a app and send to their home. In your place I would pay a bill and make a savings account for their retirement (under your wife name and that will send them x money every month).\n\nIt's difficult denying to your family when you have a more privilege situation, but I think it's necessary here.", "NTA,  there is a difference in helping and being used.  If it is a only couple of times a year that would be fine.  But $1000.00 every month is ridiculous.  I have watched programs on the economic problems in Argentina and Venezuela (the devaluation of the currency and the runaway inflation).  Plus the fact that El Salvador and 1 other country abandoned their own currency and switched to the US dollar.  Times there are hard people aren\u2019t getting paid, they have to bring their own medicine and supplies to the Dr. Her family members might not be able to get jobs.\n\nI don\u2019t know what country your wives family lives in.  That being said if you know for a fact that they are using the money for luxuries not necessities, don\u2019t send them money they are using you.  You have your own family to take care of.  Her family might think you have it good since you don\u2019t live where they live, but Europe is expensive to live in.  Plus Covid taught us we need to be more prepared for the future and have savings.  Also inflation is high and I imagine your utilities bill has gone through the roof with the Ukrainian War and Russian Sanctions.\n\nSo you could explain and rationalize saying no because you can\u2019t really afford it without putting your future at risk.  However at the end of the day no is a complete answer and you don\u2019t have to justify it to anyone.  Make sure the wife is onboard.  If you still want to give them some,  give it to the ones that really need it.", "NTA. Time to close the bank to the undeserving people.", "Nta", "Nta.  Dont bother to even check their messages. Block them if possible. You can keep relationship with those who understands and doesn't need help all the time.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA \n\nAgree on a budget, and send money only to those who need it and use it well.", "NTA.  You are not an ATM.  You need to save your money for your own needs, for your children, retirement, college, etc..... \n\nDon't light yourself on fire to keep them warm.", "NTA\n\nOnce your relatives found out you were a soft touch for money, the requests were always going to continue.\n\nPut a stop to it NOW.
