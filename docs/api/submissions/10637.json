She moved in with me over last summer under the pretenses that she will do certain chores around the house, I will do others as well as I will not charge her rent or anything like that so she can save the little money she makes while she is in college. She also doesn't have a car so I bring her to classes, and to her one job she works 2-3 times a week. Sometimes that means I have to stay up super late like 11:30 to pick her up. \n\nI don't make a lot of money but I make enough to get by comfortably and pay for a whole other person. \n\nSince about the 2nd month she moved in, she stopped doing her portion of the chores unless I say something to her. She is home much more then I am especially because 90% of her classes are virtual classes with only 1 being on campus. We have talked/ argued about this and how it isn't fair to me that I still make sure all the bills are paid, heat is on, water, etc while she is home all day but she can't do her chores without my saying something. I will let it go for days waiting and nothing gets done. \n\nThis has been going on for 6 months now and nothing changes. I love her with all my heart  I really do, but I want to kick her out for 2 weeks to show her that it's not okay that she does this to me. But the issue is, I can't do that till may when classes are out or else she would miss all her classes, work, etc as she would have no way to get there and she would move back with her parents 1 hour away. \n\nWIBTA if I kick her out before classes ended or does anyone has any advice on how I should handle this?\n\nThanks for reading!

However, be prepared for her to leave you if you do", "When faced with two choices, pick the third.     Instead of letting her stay or kicking her out for two weeks to show her how serious you are, have a serious conversation explaining why you are considering ending this living arrangement.   She may not realize her actions are relationship threatening, and will step up.  If she is not willing to take the steps needed to fix it, then she has chosen to live somewhere else.  Best of luck.", "NTA but the relationship will end. I suspect, though, the relationship will end eventually anyway.\n\nShe made a deal to live in your house in exchange for some chores, whatever they are. By not putting in the work, she's showing you what she thinks of the deal. She thinks you will just let her live there simply because you think you want her in your life. But, she is using you. Eventually, I suspect she will move on to use someone else. Probably when she's done with school.", "NTA. I understand that it's frustrating, but kicking her out is going to end your relationship. There are better ways of going about it, like setting up calendars/charts with both of your jobs on in a \"to-do list\" style and seeing how that works? I know kicking her out feels like it will teach her a lesson, but it's really just punching a one way ticket to being single.", "NTA I think it\u2019s time for a heart to heart that living together is not working out for you. Give her a set time to move out. Be prepared that this may mean the end of the relationship.", "Thank you all for your input! So many comments to reply to so i figured I'll just make a mass comment lol. I completely get where everyone is coming from about \"punishing\" her with the 2 week kick out. Your right, in a relationship I shouldn't be doing something like that. Tbh I think my mindset has unfortunately changed towards more of a parent view instead of a partner lol. I'm going to give her one last chance and give her all writen rules and have her agree to, as well as looking into the eviction process as she has been living over 30 days! Thank you all so much for your help and I hope everyone has a great day!", "YWNBTA for breaking up with her. Relationships can end without someone being an A.

You\u2019re not going to have a girlfriend after kicking her out.", "INFO: you realize kicking her out will end the relationship right?", "NTA but...  I wouldn't kick her out unless I were ready to end the relationship.  Do you have a guest bedroom that you could sleep in?  When I was a kid and didn't do my chores, my mother would pick up everything and put it in my bed.  I'd come home from school with a pile of dirty dishes, schoolwork, art supplies and laundry in my bed.  You could give it a shot, maybe? (It is a bit over-the-top but it makes a very clear point) Or - tell her you're hiring a cleaning service and expect her to pay for it, so to please supply her cc info or venmo login.", "I don't know if my approach would be the right choice, so might be it would make me an AH:\n\nConsidering it would be hard on her to get kicked out now, I'd give her until May to get her chores done without constant reminder or find a new place and add the detail that if she starts slacking even more, she needs to find her own place even sooner.  No \"If you kick me out in May I'll do nothing\" do nothing qualifies for no stay!\n\nThat's under the pretense there is no underlying issue that is the reason for her being lazy, like a depression. Then her being lazy is a sympthom of a deeper problem that needs to be treated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA:\n\nOut of curiousity, what was her living arrangement before she moved in? Did she have her own place, dorm or with her family?", "NTA I'd throw her out too", "NTA\n\nI think you should tell her she needs to be out by April 1st if she won\u2019t do her chores. You will probably break up but you are young and she isn\u2019t ready for a serious relationship if she is unable to compromise here and do housework in exchange for free rent. She is taking advantage of you and this precedent is only going to get worse later in life if you end up marrying her and having kids. Better to see if she is willing to change now than hoping it changes once you are on the line for alimony and child support.", "This is a break up issue. \n\nI don't think kicking her out for 2 weeks will solve anything and it is kinda of a weird in that the way you phrase it, you're taking on a parental role and giving her a 2 week punishment.  Maybe let her know where you stand, you are tired of having to remind her and that maybe you need an indefinite break as you are in different places in your life (she sounds still like a kid).  If she can't get her act together, dump her. Don't wait til May. She can move back in with her parents who can finish teaching her how to be an adult.", "NAH- But when you kick her out she is going to break up with you and find someone else to leech off of. You can love someone all you want but if they don't respect and love you back then you need to do what's right for you. And I am sorry but if you are paying all the bills and she cant seem to do some simple task then then this is a HUGE RED FLAG", "Info: what do you by kick her out for 2 weeks? What's happening at the end of 2 weeks? She moves back in oemr dumps you?; you know she won't right? \n\nYou need to sit down and talk to her like 2 adults.  Good luck", "Nta. I'd honestly reevaluate your relationship especially since you have talked to her about it multiple times. I would try to talk to her one more time again.  And yes if you kick her put for two weeks may be harsh and end the relationship but if she's okay for leeching off you it's not right. Relationships are suppose to be supportive of both parties not one side. It sounds like you sacrifice a lot. And  again you should reevaluate talk things over and consider if she is a long term partner or not.", "Have you told her how much this is bothering you? What are the chores she agreed to? What are yours? Clear communication and a cleaning schedule could help. It may sound silly to some but my husband and I writing down what chores we were responsible for was a huge help. It removes ground for fighting bc all household tasks are allotted for/planned. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t ready to live with her or it\u2019s just not working living together you should tell her that. It seems to me like it\u2019s about more than just tidying up? It might save your relationship in the long run if she moves back with her parents.", "NTA for being annoyed that she\u2019s clearly not interested in keeping up her end of the bargain, but this arrangement (trading chores for living rent free) frequently causes problems and causes an awkward dynamic between friends or romantic partners.", "You have very valid complaints and for that you are not an a-hole, but your conflict resolution scheme will not work.  You don't even address the very real possibility that kicking her out of your home may result in your relationship ending.\n\nYou can love someone with all of your heart, but also be highly incompatible living together.  When two people differ greatly in how they live, under what conditions they find acceptable in their living conditions, it usually does not work out long-term no matter how much they love each other.\n\nYou do not provide any detail in your post for us to understand the level of difference between you and your girlfriend.  For example, are you a neat freak and some of the \"chores\" she has failed to do are what most people would only do once a month?  Imagine one of her chores being to clean the blinds.  On the other hand, are you fairly reasonable, and one of her \"chores\" is unloading and loading the dishwasher, and she lets dishes pile up for days?\n\nAnd, by chores, are you doing your part in this as well?  For example, are the \"chores\" . . . everything house related, and she is expected to do all of yours as well?  For example, you expect her to find your dirty clothes wherever you discard them . . . your dirty dishes wherever you leave them, the dropped, toothpaste you just leave on the counter . . . etc.?\n\nIt is not unreasonable to think she might do more dishes and laundry because she is home more, and does not put in a full 8 hours with school and work, but if you expect her to pick up after you like she would a toddler that is another story, and one in which you are inviting resentment.\n\nFurthermore, though she has a part-time job and is attending school, are you doing your math correctly when you add up those responsibilities, along with the time she has to study, which is part of the college responsibility?  In other words, though she is home more, is she doing the equivalent of 50 hours of college and work, while you do 40 hours of work, yet you are treating her time commitments as less than your own?\n\nThough it is rare, there are married couples who have been together for years, living next door to each other.  If your lifestyles are so incompatible, yet you love her with all your heart, maybe living separate for an extended period of time is the answer.  But to ask her to move out with the hopes that this \"punishment\" will \"change\" her is woefully short-sighted and will not work.", "Dump her and put all of the money you were spending on her in a savings account.", "INFO: What's her reason for not doing the chores?", "YTA. I want to make this clear. You're not the asshole for wanting chores split. You're not the asshole for being frustrated about the current problems. But kicking someone out of their home \"to teach them a lesson\" is unacceptable from a partner. Full stop.", "YWNBTA but this isn't a valid solution. I don't think she will learn a lesson from this, it's not like you're her father. \n\nSimply the relationship isn't going to work.", "YWBTA, matter of fact is I don't understand how that can't change the way you feel about a person. It's complete disrespect of the way you mutually decided things are going to be handled. I understand you have spoken about this multiple times and still nothing changes. Time to have the talk... you shouldn't be parenting a grown woman and I'll guess that back home she was raised the same and didn't have any responsibilities at the house. Let her know that this can't go on any longer, it will go either 2 ways. 1 - this will make her understand how unfair that is and lead to a change or 2 - she will blame you and make YOU seem like the bad guy (in that case, run for tour life). And again I wouldn't make this about teaching her a lesson, just put out the facts like a grown up and that might push her to step up.", "ESH. To me, kicking someone out should be because they broke your trust somehow and you need to terminate your relationship with them asap. Because that's what it will do. If she comes back to you after getting kicked out, that's a whole different bunch of red flags.\n\nIt sounds like your gf is a bit immature compared to you. You need to have a real conversation with her about your expectations regarding chores and put on the table the fact that if she's not contributing to the household, you'd rather live separately. If you two are not able to discuss chores in a mature way, maybe indeed you should break up, but not without giving her a heads up that she needs to find a new place.", "ESH. She should obviously be helping around the house. Threatening to kick someone out isn't a healthy way to have this conversation with your partner, and frankly it's naive to think you'd only be kicking her out for two weeks.", "She\u2019s using you , are you her sugar daddy or her boyfriend, there is a difference.", "As a girl myself, I know if a man don't bother to do chores, its'.... Ugh. And she's doing this, precisely.\n\nHOWETHER\n\nI know what it is, being on your 20ies and having a hard time learning this shouldn't be onto your mother's shoulders.\n\nKicking her out is the YTA thing, and I hope none of you would go back to each other after this. But you're not her mom and shouldn't have to go after her.\n\nSadly, she will need a long time to go into adulthood enough to help for good and not only for few days before going back to lazyness. Do you wan't to be the mom until then, doing chores and telling her to do the chores, again and again ?\n\nHope some reddittors have a better way to adress this. Eventually, stop doing chores that help her ? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Wash only your own dishes and laundry ? (Honestly not sure about this one, but if women do this on their partners, why not you ?)\n\nYou have my support, as long as your not considering \"kicking her out for 2 weeks\" seriously. I'd understand way better \"kicking her out for good\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Chances are she\u2019d do her fair share for maybe a couple weeks and then go back to how she is now.\n\nYou need to talk to her and make it clear you won\u2019t accept her no doing her fair share any more and that if she continues to leave everything to you then maybe you don\u2019t have a future together.\n\nI know that a break up probably isn\u2019t what you want but I\u2019ve watched friends do exactly what you\u2019re thinking about and nothing ever got resolved, their partners would would be on their best behaviour for a week, they\u2019d revert back to their previous behaviour, they\u2019d get sent away again and the cycle would just continue because in the end they were totally getting away with what they were doing. Sending them away for a bit was of no consequence to them. Years later a lot of them still have the same problems.\n\nIt needs to be clear that she either does her fair share or she loses you.

How much room can he give her, but no less important what does he need. And as lazy as I am myself, he needs to feel comfortable when he gets home. \n\nHis solution to kick her out for two weeks seems inpractical, but as he from the beginning was looking for other solutions.
