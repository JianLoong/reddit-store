I'm doing a lot of assuming, whish is dangerous, but still.\n\nSome of this is worry about you because he loves you. You are his kid, and he doesn't want you to get hurt. Some of it is about not wanting to let go of control over you. But you are an adult, and he has to come to term with the fact that his control over you is done. The ratio of those two is what determines if your relationship is toxic, and if he WILL come to terms with the fact that he no longer controls your life. You know your dad better than us redditors do. \n\nYou didn't feel the need to explicitly hide your plans from your father, but you also felt like you couldn't explicitly or enthusiasticaly share your plans either, not without facing some form of retribution or backlash from your dad. \n\nHugs from the internet.", "NTA.

Or they have anxiety or some other reason they're bad at it, but their mishandling of their own emotions causes them to lash out at people. Likely your father was nervous or scared for you to be out on your own, or he felt sad about you not living there, but he can't express or doesn't understand that, so this is the result.\n\nMy grandmother is the same way. Lots of anxiety, it all comes out in anger and lashing out. She was worried about my Mom moving away for college, so she lashed out in similar ways.", "NTA, you feel guilty because he was trying to manipulate you.

The whole paragraph about your dad is just a list of manipulative, guilt-trippy nonsense. What he needs to get over is his downright nasty way of communicating with (or, more likely for my money, trying to control) you. He's a grown man.

And then, literally three days before the move (my parents and I were all moving out the same day), my mom asked me seriously: \"Do you really want to stay here?\" I said of course, I wouldn't have campaigned and done all this work if I wasn't sure.

Out of curiosity, do you think any of his reaction has anything to do with the fact you are moving away to move in with your bf? Not that it really matters much - his response is shitty and childish regardless of the reason. \n\nYou are very kind natured to be worried about whether or not you caused this reaction by not communicating your plans to him sooner due to his anxieties, but honestly, you are an adult and I agree with your mom that he needs to figure it out and get a handle on his own emotions and anxieties. Not your problem. And frankly, if it were me and he said those things/lectured me for four hours on it, I would have gotten up and said \u201cthis behavior is exactly why I have no desire to move back home\u201d and walk away. But, I\u2019m petty that way."]}
