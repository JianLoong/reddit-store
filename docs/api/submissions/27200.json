But if a strange, unleashed dog runs up on my kids at a playground (or anywhere tbh ) and I can\u2019t tell whether it\u2019s friendly or not, it might get kicked.

We raised him from the start with the expectation we'd have one day a kid, and to make consultations easier (on our dog behaviour specialist veterinary advice).\n\nSo we regularly put our hand in the bowl when he was eating as a puppy (sharp teeth so it hurts, but not much power), or fiddled with his ears or mouth. We could then gently explain to him not to bite in those situations.\n\nBut still: the day he first met a real baby, I was centimeters away from them but still felt time slow down when the baby grabbed with one hand an ear and with the other the moustache. I knew if my dog wanted to bite, I'd not be fast enough. \n\nThankfully, he only turned his head to me, making sad eyes to ask me to intervene. \n\nBut still: as a dog owner, I knew I messed up!", "Yup. It\u2019s been over 15 years, and I still years and I still have the scar where my incredibly mellow, chill, gentle sweet Newfoundland bit me through a heavy peacoat and several layers of clothes. He was the most gentle dog in the world, the epitome of a gentle giant, but he was scared, and so he bit.\nLuckily, he was MY dog. And even so, he bit me when scared.", "Absolutely. My own story involving a kid:\n\nMy family had a toy poodle. This dog was one of the sweetest dogs you\u2019d ever meet. She never bit, snapped, or even growled at anyone. She LOVED people. Everyone was her friend or a friend she hadn\u2019t met yet.\n\nAbout 4 years ago, my cousins came for an extended visit with their three kids, one of whom was 4. The 4 y.o. chased our dog around the house and constantly wanted to play with her. Our dog loved this \u2014 initially. After a while, she started giving the kid calming signals, like the tucked tail, whale eyes, and moving away before eventually coming to either me or my mom for safety, wanting to be picked up and held. The kid didn\u2019t stop. To my cousin\u2019s credit, she tried to get her daughter several times to leave our dog alone, but she didn\u2019t stop. Sometime on day 2, she snapped. For the first time in her 10 years of living, she snapped. This was only a warning snap in the air in front of the kid, but it spooked her big-time. She starts wailing. My cousin never placed the blame on our little dog because she was scared and felt backed into a corner. That dog to this day still walks away from kids. (Though she\u2019s an old girl with cataracts, so I don\u2019t know if she\u2019d clearly recognize a young kid if one came near.)\n\nIt\u2019s our job to be our dog\u2019s advocate for both the dog\u2019s safety and comfort and the kid\u2019s, as well.

How dare you not respect her! ;)", "My two year old recently got knocked over and scratched up by an off leash dog jumping up on her when we were on a walk.

She\u2019s terrified of all dogs now, god knows how long it is going to take us to get her back to being okay with them.", "We had one jump up on my stroller (with my daughter in it) and eat her snack right off her tray. All while the owner yelling, \"She's friendly.\"\n\nYou best believe I pushed that dog off my stroller and stood in front of it, screaming my ever loving head off, telling him to get his fucking dog on a leash. Then, I told him to enjoy the shits with his dog tonight because he just ate a double chocolate muffin off of my kids' tray.

We were walking down a path together and she was only a few feet ahead of me, and this dog rounded the corner and leapt on her faster than anyone could react.
