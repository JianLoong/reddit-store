Think about it from the parents\u2019 perspective; they do not know you or your dog. Even very well trained dogs can snap at a child in the right conditions, and they have no way of knowing if your dog is or isn\u2019t well trained. I have family members with very well trained and well behaved dogs and I NEVER let them interact with my son without me or his father being RIGHT there on top of them. And their owners not only agree wholeheartedly but also help me keep an eye on them at all times because they also understand that at the end of the day a dog is an ANIMAL with animal instincts who can *literally kill* a child in just a moment under the right (wrong?) circumstances. \n\nFind a dog park, OP, or at the very least leash your dog in a public park.

WTF - thought this was America - not Soviet Russia.", "There may very well be a municipal leash law, and having a dog running around off leash is illegal, unless you are in a dog park or other area where it's explicitly permitted.
