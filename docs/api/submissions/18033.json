When my partner and I moved in together, there was some tiny differences in how we did chores (nothing this egregious). And we settled it by just logically figuring out which person\u2019s method was cleaner/more efficient. This would drive me crazy \u2014 NTA", "Nta- that's pretty basic tasks that only take a few seconds to a minute tops. It would absolutely drive me insane and would be a deal breaker.", "Just here to say you should never line your air fryer, with foil or anything.", "This is divorce-worthy levels of disgustingness. NTA.", "NTA. The point at which you create extra work or additional mess when you are supposedly cleaning or tidying is a clear point when it crosses a line from different standards to just plain wrong. \n\nAlso, some of these things are very unhygienic or have the potential to damage appliances.", "NTA - but everybody has different levels of cleanliness, she just seems exceedingly untidy and for some people that\u2019s normal. Not sure how you\u2019re going to sort this out - maybe you clean but then she has to do other tasks to make the chores equal like maybe she does the grocery shopping or yardwork or something like that if you do the cleaning. Some people just don\u2019t see dirt and don\u2019t care if it is messy. If it is your love language to live in a tidy house, she should be more mindful of that if that\u2019s the route you want to go\u2026", "NTA. Quit doing all of it. Tell her you\u2019re going to do it her way for awhile. She if she changes her tune.", "You're NTA or YTA based entirely on how exactly you are broaching this. You said your wife has \"bad habits born of laziness\" which is not a good way to start things off. \n\nSo, INFO: when you say you're broaching the subject, is it \"Sweetie, none of the stuff in the dishwasher got clean because there's like a ton of peanut butter still on these spoons. Can you try to remember to rinse stuff off first? Thanks, love you.\" or is \"How many fucking times do I need to ask you to do this shit the right way? Are you stupid?\" \n\nCause yes, partners usually have personal habits that don't align with the other person's, or different standards, and it can be frustrating, but you're her spouse, not her parent, it isn't your job to \"fix her\" or \"teach her the right way\" or break these \"bad, lazy habits\".", "NTA. It\u2019s basic decency in a shared living environment to be clean, hygienic, and clean up after oneself. And even more as a married couple, she should be considerate of you", "NTA, but you have to bring this issue up in a different way for her to come around. I agree with you that these habits are objectively gross and make chores more difficult than they need to be. However, if she\u2019s picking up your opinion that she has \u201chabits born out of laziness\u201d, she probably feels judged or looked down upon. You should try to talk to her about this without making her feel like she\u2019s at fault, and offer some sort of solution that doesn\u2019t come off as \u201cmy way is the only way and you\u2019re gross for doing it your way\u201d.", "wow that's disgusting. you definitely have a legit gripe. NTA at all. \n\n>\u201cjust because you do it that way, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right\u201d.\n\nshe's wrong. there is a right and wrong here. she's wrong.", "NTA. Look, reasonable people can have different standards of tidiness/cleanliness, but your wife\u2019s standards are unreasonable and frankly gross, and she is leaving an unfair amount of labor for you to handle. You really need to sit down and have a (civil, of course) discussion around reasonable expectations of cleanliness.", "NTA but I would encourage therapy as she sounds likes she reacting poorly due to inherent insecurity/lack of self confidence..you mentioned she has been living on her own since 18 and sometimes if you make that jump without learning self care properly from parents this happens more often than not\u2026I had been seeing a therapist about parental neglect and abandonment issues and my partner pointed to these very same traits you described immediately\u2026it helped me realize why I was so defensive which was rooted in my own insecurities and self confidence as my partner was to me subconsciously challenging my confidence I had in myself to survive, live and make it on my own aka abandonment issues\u2026pretty cliche but that\u2019s what it was..anecdotal but if you want to salvage something try a therapist", "1.

Points 4 and 5 - you have children. This is literally a biohazard for them, especially if they aren't old enough to understand the concept of germs. For those two things alone this is a hill to die on because your kids health should come first. \n\nWhat happens if one of your kid ingests something that was on the floor and has to go to the hospital because they got sick? How are you going to explain that? \n\nThis isn't \"she leaves her dirty socks on the floor\" kind of a problem. This is a \"you could end up with a trip to the er and a potential cps visit\" kind of a problem.

So whatever you cook doesn't get fried and crusted on the pan, it's part of most basic recipes and while it is technically a preference, it sounds like OP is who deals with it regardless so she should be more courteous about something that takes 2 seconds and makes doing dishes way easier.", "if you think he's being too nitpicky i'm very curious about the state of your home.", "It is either spelled nit-picky or nitpicky.", "This comment is both nitpicky and nit-picky", "NTA.
