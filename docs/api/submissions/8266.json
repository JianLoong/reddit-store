There\u2019s likely no harm in waiting. If I got married to everyone I thought I would before I was 25, I\u2019d have had at least 3 marriages. \ud83d\ude05 Having a screwed family can make a lot of people (albeit not necessarily you) seek family & love from partners\u2019 families with a sort of relentless desperation. And a lot of why I was so in a rush to get married was to legitimize a relationship that I felt insecure about, in a sense, by seeking external validation. And a sort of rush to get onto \u201cthe next phase\u201d of life \u2014 like having kids and \u201cbeing\u201d married. Exciting! Eventually getting married didn\u2019t change much, but we changed a LOT in the next 10 years. Our values have completely shifted/refined & our lives utterly changed. I can\u2019t imagine if I\u2019d stayed with any of those people I immensely loved & felt fully devoted to, convinced I would marry. Or if, god forbid, we had kids that young when I thought it was a great fun idea to be a mom. With no career, little education & no money. Way harder to do any of those things with kids, and even if you do, hard on a partnership. Religion, romcoms & existential loneliness were far larger factors in a desire for marriage then than anything substantial or emotional that certificate could provide. It doesn\u2019t mean fidelity, reliability, happiness or safety. It largely just means paperwork, and maybe a tax break. This may totally not be you, ofc, but I wish people had been straight with me, so I\u2019m going internet rando baddie sharing another perspective. lol Beg pardon if it\u2019s way off base. Wish you both the best!\n\nAnd yeah, your parents are acting like babies.

Unfortunately, this isn't a cut and dry situation:\n\nAs I've gotten older, I've realized something.  The wedding ceremony is for the family and the reception is for the friends.

So, for anyone that believes that they fit the \"family\" description, it's going to feel like a HUGE slight not to be present for the \"I Do\".  \n\nMy guess is that your mom is freaking out because she thinks there won't be a wedding ceremony/reception later, and I'm going to agree with her.  Once you've signed the paperwork and changed your name, you're married.  Taking the time to plan a fancy ceremony and spend big $$ on a reception several years down the road will seem like an unnecessary expsense and a waste of time, especially since you've described yourself as \"not wedding people.\"  \n\nWeddings are one of life's joys, and each couple has the right to dictate all of the details - how, when, where, etc and it sounds like you've made your decision on all of that.
