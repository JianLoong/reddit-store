He has about 10% of normal hearing, which is enough that he understands spoken words if they're shouted at him, but not really enough for him to use it for any practical purpose. He's had this level of hearing since hearing since he got an ear infection as a baby.\n\nWe obviously took steps to make sure he could thrive ithoug his hearing. Myself my husband, and his sister are all fluent in sign and use it almost exclusively in the house, even with eachother. He goes to a school for deaf and HoH children, and really doesn't have anything that he can't do that hearing children can't\n\nHis doctors have suggested cochlear implants, they wouldn't restore all his hearing, but perhaps as much as 40-50%, enough for him to utilize it. This is hot topic in the deaf community, and for the most part a lot of parents choose not to do this. Being deaf isn't the worst thing in the world, and plenty of deaf people have achived great things in life. It's not really an obsticle to living a full life anymore.\n\nOur son recently became privy to our decision to not give him the surgery, and he's been furious. He thinks we want he to be \"Disabled\" and that we're depriving him if a full life. We explained that that's a very ableist line of thinking, and there's no need for a surgery that wouldn't improve his quality of life.\n\nHe's even gotten his sister (she's 16 by the way)in on this, and she's been spewing some very ableist rhetoric, which is where I think he got it from. She's claiming we love having a disabled child more than we love having A child, and that we're being cruel. Now our son isn't speaking to us, and refuses to use sign in the house.", "created_utc": 1684178141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13iheuv/aita_for_not_letting_our_son_get_cochlear_implants/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not letting your son get cochlear implants when he wants them makes you both self-centered AHs caring only how you will be perceived in the deaf community.  And 40-50% hearing will allow a much greater ease of life for him.  Think airports, trains, anyplace information is broadcast over a PA system.  How about movies and concerts.  The difference is that YOU have decided he should have a more difficult time navigating the world around him because YOU want him to embrace and revel in his hearing loss. He just wants to enjoy and experience life through a sense that has been denied him.  I also suspect, given the tone of your post, that your decisions you made for his healthcare led to his prolonged and severe ear infection.", "\n\nRemember feminism?

She still needs accommodations in many situations.  It isn't magic. \n\nSo while I understand your philosophy of \"it isn't going to fix everything\", it does open up the world a quite a bit.

Good luck, OP.", "Based on what I've heard from the Deaf and HoH communities, I would say that up until your son expressed his opinion, you were not the a-hole. You ensured his deafness was embraced in your family and home, and not something that just needed to be \"treated.\" However, now your son has expressed that he does, in fact, want the implants, and you need to respect that decision, even if it wasn't what you anticipated. \n\nIs there anyone at your son's school you could all speak with?

Wouldn\u2019t that be up to him ultimately?", "Im choosing to believe you are a troll or an AI prompt designed to make fun if woke parenting run amok and stir up hatred for the progressive agenda.  Because I can\u2019t imagine a parent (hearing parents no less) would deprive their child of an opportunity to comfortably hear the sound of their own voices. \nIt\u2019s a beautiful sentiment that there\u2019s nothing wrong with him. And that\u2019s true. He\u2019s perfect whole and complete. But there is by definition \u2014something wrong with his hearing!! And if they can be restored to any degree- then your son should be in the drivers seat in making this decision. He wants this. And you are stealing his agency away. \nI guarantee if you cost him this opportunity, he will blame you for the rest of his life. And you will blame yourself too.", "And when he needs glasses? What then???", "It's great that you accept and love your child the way that he is, but that doesn't mean that YOU can dictate HIS wishes about his own bodily autonomy. I think you massively misunderstood the discussion of a community that you aren't even a part of. I think the general consensus is that disabled people should not be treated like they're \"broken\" and they \"need to be fixed\" in order to be a happy and fully functioning member of society. The point is not to push \"fixes\" on people who don't want them just because society does not want to be \"inconvenienced\" by having to be inclusive. But there is a difference between treating all disabled people like their main goal should be to come as close to being an able bodied person as possible, and denying your own child medical treatment that he decided himself he wants to have!! You realise that you sound kind of crazy right? Like you're more concerned with how you might be perceived by a community that, again, you're not a part of, than with giving your child access to the experiences that he might want to have. It is not your child's job to stand up as a moral beacon to signal to society that someone who is hard of hearing should be treated the exact same and giving every chance and experience as any able bodied person. Yes, that should be the case, but it is not, and your son is not there for you to virtue signal! To him, it probably feels like you're punishing him to prove a point, and that will create serious resentment towards you. Hope that's worth it for you to be able to continue sitting on your high horse while hearing perfectly fine", "You are using him as a political pawn. Ablism is a thing, but not everyone wants to play that game. He doesn't. Your refusal is child abuse.\n\nWhy not poke his eyes out and break his legs too? Get the full disabled trifecta. Just think of how your reputation would soar in the woke community.", "You may feel he is \"ok, fine, not broke\"  but part of him will always feel that way... try living your life with some hardship...I have nerve damage to my ears and had to relearn to walk after something happened to me... he wants to have the chance of \"being a normal kid\"... it dosnt have to make sense to you, it's about him sonyes you are the ASSHOLE... and put your kid and how they feel first... especially when it's something that change his life for the better....\n\nYTA...YTA...YTA...YTA...YTA...", "This isn\u2019t about fixing, it\u2019s about improving his quality of life. It is his life after all, his opinion should carry the most weight.", "Not being able to hear is something wrong with him.", "HE wants it, so HIS opinion is the one that counts, not YOURS.  YTA", "But again, why not? He wants it, so what\u2019s the problem? Is it too expensive? Is the procedure risky? With something like this, there should be a reason beyond it not being necessary.", "You are not the one with the hearing challenge. I do not see how you can say he does not need it when you are not in his shoes. You have done a good job getting him in a good environment for school and family, but that will not be there his whole life.\n\nIt sounds like you made this decision without asking him what he wanted, I can understand him being upset. He is 11, he can definitely make this decision on his own.\n\nYTA, listen to him.", "Obviously he feels the need for it.", "In your opinion. Your opinion honestly is third in line of importance. First is doctor, second is yknow the child actually dealing with not being able to hear, third is you. If you truly care, you would do research with your son and let him make an informed decision.", "Why are you making this choice for your son? He\u2019s the one that has to live his life not you. YTA", "If someone else decided you should be blinded tomorrow because \"being blind isn't the worst thing in the world\" would you be upset about that?", "See i can kinda see it, but its not a cure. Its a tool that helps get a certain % back. As long as the parents aren't talking about it like its a miracle thing, and they explain to the kid not to judge another people as less then if they don't have it. \n\nI get the other side to now tho, thanks.", "You\u2019ve got me. I don\u2019t see the logic either.", "yes. considering 50% is larger then 10%.", "Oh he can still listen to music, just in a different way than hearing people. He can feel the virbrations of the music.", "There's nothing he can't do now that the surgery will allow him to do.", "i think you and i are on the same side here", "> He can feel the virbrations of the music\n\nSo can you, just go touch a speaker. Do you get enjoyment out of it?", "Thats not hearing, thats feeling.", "thats clearly not the same thing is it though...", "That's not the same at all. I don't know where you're getting this assumption  that the surgery won't improve his quality of life.", "Except hear.", "The arrogance is truly astounding.", "You have to be joking. Did you not think about all the shit he can\u2019t do now? You are trying to limit what he can do because of your own feelings.\n\nHow about:\n\nBe able to take classes without the need for accommodation.\n\nBe able to make friends outside of people who can sign. While he\u2019s in a deaf school that\u2019s not an issue, but what happens after he graduates?\n\nGet involved in activities and hobbies without having to worry about accommodations.\n\nListen to music.\n\nGo to a movie theater without having to worry about accommodations.\n\nHear a siren behind him when he\u2019s old enough to drive.\n\nCommunicate with a stranger to ask a question (like asking where something is in a store).\n\nBe able to work without accommodations. It\u2019s harder disabled people to find jobs. \n\nHear an alarm clock in the morning.", "You are absolutely wrong. With the surgery, he would be able to have verbal conversations with peers who don't know sign language, which is pretty much all of his peers outside of his school. And for the rest of his life.", "Hold a normal conversation.\n\nListen to music.\n\nHave improved situational awareness.\n\nBroaden his social circle immensely.\n\nLessen his dependence on his parents \u00a0\u2014\u00a0oh wait, now I know why you don't want him to have them. Munchausen by proxy.", "Music?  Birdsong?  Rain falling?  YOU sound like the deaf one here.  YTA", "You have no clue. Being hard of hearing SUCKS. Especially when you're young. Children are cruel. And it just plain makes life harder. I feel like you don't want to see it.", "Besides being able to hear more than people yelling?", "sorry I thought I responded to OP", "Deaf people hold normal conversations just as speakers of other languages do. Let\u2019s take that one off the list.", "The implants don\u2019t restore hearing the way hearing people hear. He won\u2019t be able to differentiate pitches to hear music. Birdsongs will likely not register unless that bird is right in front of him. It will *potentially* help him hear people speaking to him directly.", "Only \"normal\" with people who can sign.", "Just like all speakers of other languages."]}
