{"id": 10282, "submission_id": "115gxgp", "title": "AITA for calling my SIL a \"dictator\" for her parenting style after my son was excluded from a \"childfree\" wedding?", "selftext": "I (32f) have a son (9m). My husband has a younger sister (SIL, 35f) who has two children (8f-6f). She and her husband are, in my opinion, pretty strict with their daughters. They're both psychologists, but I don't think they know what they're doing. These are some rules they enforce on them in public:\n\n1. Raise their hands to speak and wait for permission.\n2. Don't interrupt adults when they're talking.\n3. Leave everything where it was after taking/playing with/moving it.\n\nEveryone praises their daughters for being so well behaved, but I think they're cruel. I've never seen them running, screaming or crying. They play with other children well, but always clean up afterwards, and if they don't behave, my SIL gives them an angry look and they stop immediately. I admit that my son is not the best behaved when we leave the house, but at least he acts like a kid. It's normal for them to be loud, messy, throw a tantrum once in a while and interrupt others. They even act like that when their parents aren't around and I feel sorry for them. They don't seem to be unhappy though.\n\nMy husband's brother got married a few days ago and the invitations said it was a childfree wedding, so we left our son with a babysitter. Like I said before, he doesn't behave well in public, and I knew he would throw a tantrum, so I decided not to fight it. But my nieces were at the wedding, both of them as flower girls. I asked the bride in private later and she said *\"Yes, it's a childfree wedding, but they're the exception. They're well behaved and I know they won't make a mess, unlike others\"* with a smile, referring to my son between lines. I understand her reasons, but that comparison was unnecessary.\n\nI feel like my son was unfairly excluded for behaving like a child. I talked about it with my SIL later and she didn't know it was a childfree wedding, since the bride included her daughters without any issue. However, she agreed that my son wouldn't be able to behave well at a formal event and that perhaps I should *\"teach him how to act in public\"*. That bothered me. I told her that I would rather have my son being happy than be a \"dictator\" mom like her, because she's clearly abusive towards her girls.\n\nSIL didn't say anything, just looked offended, took her daughters and left. But others sided with her, calling me jealous because her daughters are well behaved and sweet while no one can stand my son. Everyone agreed and no one defended me or my son. So far, I've received calls and texts saying that I owe SIL an apology, that I was rude, bitter and a bad mother. My husband also agrees that I should apologize and that we should teach our son some manners, because he's tired of him being excluded from big events for misbehaving (not the first wedding he didn't go), but I think I was right for telling my SIL the truth, and she's denying her daughters a real childhood. So AITA for calling her a dictator?\n\nEdit: there are high chances that my son is on the spectrum. We'll know the diagnosis next week. I've suspected it for years, but my husband agreed to take him to therapy last month.", "created_utc": 1676731715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115gxgp/aita_for_calling_my_sil_a_dictator_for_her/", "score": 1562, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Most people would rather deny a hard truth than face it. Reflect on that.\n\nEdit for judgment: YTA", "If you re read your own post, you'll see many admissions of you being wrong about the entire situation. \n\n> They don't seem to be unhappy though.\n\nYou said you want your son to be happy, which is why you're not acting \"like a dictator\", but you also say that your nieces are well behaved, disciplined AND happy. Which means one can enforce boundaries on children without making them unhappy.\n\n> Like I said before, he doesn't behave well in public, and I knew he would throw a tantrum\n\nYou seem to know that your son is unbearable. \n\n> But others sided with her, calling me jealous because her daughters are well behaved and sweet while no one can stand my son. Everyone agreed and no one defended me or my son.\n\nAnd other people told you, to your face, that your son is unbearable. \n\nTo answer the question \"AITA for criticizing my SIL's parenting style and calling her a dictator?\", the answer is yes. As a parent, you know you should not criticize another parent's parenting style unless there is neglect or abuse happening. All parents are different and their children too are different. That means embracing different parenting style. Just because you wouldn't do it like your SIL, it does not mean she's wrong. \n\nBut there are other reasons for you to be A : \n\n* Being judgemental of your SIL and her husband's parenting style continuously;\n* Doubting of their professional capacities as psychologists, with no training and no experience to do so; \n* Confronting the bride - on the day of the wedding - for her guest choices; \n* Calling a mother \"abusive\" (way worse than calling her \"dictator\", way to bury the lead) for teaching her daughter discipline;\n* Neglecting your son's education when it comes to matters of social grace to such an extent that many people intervened to let you know that you're doing a poor job and your son is a nightmare; \n* Not realizing that childhood is when a child learns to be a grown up. What do you think is going to happen? That your child is going to be messy, tantrumy, interrupty \"like a normal child with a normal childhood\" until he reaches puberty and then he'll magically know how to behave? Kids will be kids, that's why it's on the parent to show them immediately what is acceptable and what is not, impose boundaries, and so on. \n\nSo, the story is not about your \"right to tell your SIL the truth\" (1. it's *your* truth, not a universal one 2. why is it your right to tell anything to anyone with no repercussions whatsoever? that's not how adult world works) and \"telling your SIL her daughters are denied a childhood\", despite the conclusion of your OP. \n\nIt's basically a story of you not knowing how to act in public and similarly not teaching much about it to your son. \n\nYTA. Not like it will matter much to you.", "INFO: At what age do you think a person should have manners in public and not throw tantrums? The way you describe your kid and the way others see him, it sounds like you let him act like a two year old. Is it okay for him to act like a toddler when he is a preteen? If you don't address his behavior now, that's how he will continue to act in middle school and into high school. Is it okay for him to have a tantrum in the middle of the DMV because he has to wait in line to take his drivers test? People don't suddenly behave differently because of their age, they behave differently because they are taught to.", "INFO: what does your SIL do that is abusive? I missed it in your OP.\n\nRegardless, undoubtedly YTA.  I really thought this had to be a troll at first, who thinks it\u2019s bad parenting to teach your children to not interrupt and to pick up after themselves? But then I remembered that there are absolutely parents who think this is totally appropriate and do not teach their children standard manners or how to behave.", "Read this elsewhere on Reddit but feel it applies perfectly to your situation: \u201cif it smells like shit everywhere you go, it\u2019s time to check your shoes\u201d.

And that well-mannered is their behaviour . . . as children? \n\nYTA for admitting that other children are well-behaved and happy, and then changing your mind and deciding that they're NOT happy and that your SIL must be \"abusive\" because it's the only way you can justify your own kid's being so awful that literally everyone in the extended family openly admits to being unable to bear his presence. He's not \"behaving like a child\" . . . he's just feral. And you're not giving him some important childhood normalcy, you're just giving him a childhood where he's shunned by everyone he should have relationships with because he's so impossible to tolerate - BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION. I feel as sorry for your son as I do for anyone who has to be around him. You've stolen a lot of wonderful experiences from him by not teaching him boundaries and manners.", "YTA. It sounds like you never grew up either, OP.", "First off, unless you've seen evidence of ACTUAL abuse, don't throw around that word. does your husband use that word? And do you think it comes from your SIL or your BIL, too, since they are both the parents and both psychologists? There is nothing wrong with the rules, although if no one is speaking and there is nothing going on, I don't see the need for hand raising, and you don't see them all the time to know that they never \"act like kids\". Hopefully at 8 they don't throw tantrums in public, but yeah, sometimes it happens. These are the same rules they are expected to follow at school. But who knows. You don't know what goes on in their house. And because they are psychologists this makes you question their qualifications to practice their profession?\n\nThere is a lot to unpack in this post, but that part I'm just going to leave in the first paragrah.\n\nYTA certainly. You took your brother in law and his bride's day and made it about your son and your nieces and you and your sister in law's petty squabble. You could have had that discussion any time after the wedding but you chose to make it public. Her daughters were IN the wedding and frankly, they were better behaved than you were, it sounds like.\n\nYour son was not the only child excluded. I'm sure you are not the only parent that was invited, so your son was not the only child that was left at home. (Frankly, it's ridiculous for people to bring children under the age of 10, at least, to a formal wedding, IMO, anyway.) You are making yourself into a martyr when it could very well be that there was some type of negotiation about your nieces being allowed to stay for the reception, but you don't know what goes on behind closed doors.", "Sounds like someone compares herself too much to successful parents and is realizing that her parenting skills aren't top notch", "YTA. Well behaved kids are not being abused. Teach your son how to act.", "I love how op says her child is not well behaved and doesn't know how to clean up after himself. But then gets made when he is not invited to a event where it is important to be well behaved and to clean up.", "YTA. Yes they sound strict, but strict and abusive are absolutely not the same. The hand up thing is weird though.\nHowever; your son is 9, not 3. It\u2019s not unreasonable to have a 9 year old know to not interrupt anyone and to tidy up after themselves. Laissez faire parenting is not doing him any favours.", "YTA it was not your wedding and therefore you had zero right to complain about the child free rule. You said so yourself that your child is not able to behave well in public. And as someone who works with children professionally, tantrums are not normal at the age of 9, nor is it normal to just accept your kid has such bad behavior in public", "YTA - you and your kid are the problems here. You have no idea what you are doing as a parent if your 9 your old isn\u2019t fit to be in public.", "YTA. You know it. Everyone knows it. Please stop enabling your child to be so misbehaved, especially in public.", "Wow.  \n\n\nI have a son (now 28 and doing great) who had behavioral issues resulting from both medical PTSD (surgery in infancy) and neurological atypicality.  He had to leave one preschool and one school because they couldn't cope with his \"stuff.\"  (another preschool and another school could and did).  Most other kids didn't get him and I'm sure a lot of adults didn't either.  \n\n\nDid I rant and call them names?  No.  I took him to several kinds of therapy, worked hard to find the best schools, worked with him on my own from morning till night to hammer in that even though some of what he did was not intentional nor malicious, he still was responsible for the results.    \n\n\nIt hurt a lot that he was excluded, but it was my (and later his) responsibility to get him to the point where he could do the social stuff.  \n\n\nIf your kid has issues underlying his behavior, get him help now.  Being loud and messy are kind of typical kid behaviors.  Throwing tantrums (multiple occasions, sounds like) at 9 is, I'm not going to dx him, but a cry for help, I think.    \n\n\nIf your kid just has never learned how to behave in public and you think that's just \"being a kid,\" then, well, the natural consequences of that behavior are sometimes rejection and exclusion.  If that's what you prefer for him, well, that's on you and your spouse, but don't call other people with other approaches names.  \n\n\nEven if they were overly strict parents, which I'm not sure you have the lens to judge with, how they parent is none of your business.  \n\n\nYTA for sure and I hope this gets you to look at your son's behavior as more than just being a bit loud and messy.", "Yta\n\nYou're the reason why people don't want children at weddings.

While yes, children should get to run and play and be noisy within reason and during appropriate times, public spaces are not your child's property. They should not be causing a mess every place they go. And yes if adults are talking children should not interrupt.  And if they do they should say excuse me. You are raising and entitle child and you also think that your little angel should have been allowed to ruin a wedding because his cousins who know how to act in the real world were there. 9 is way to old to not be cleaning up after yourself, throwing tantrums, and acting up in public.

Not allowing them to interrupt people when their talking and making them clean up after themselves is pretty standard. Your kid is 9, what you\u2019re doing is creating an entitled monster.

I have a kid around that age and they're not perfect, sometimes they have to be reminded that we don't interrupt others when they're talking for example, but the things you're listing as normal kid behavior in public doesn't seem that developmentally appropriate at 9. I had to look back at the ages because I thought we were talking about a 4-5 year old. \n\n9 is quite old enough to get that public places are shared spaces and a certain kind of behaving is needed when you share spaces with others.\n\nEDIT- Ok your edit is confusing. Wouldn't that have been vital information for the original post?? When your SIL told you to teach your kid to behave in public, wouldn't you have responded with that?

Your son is 9 years old and still throwing tantrums, and you somehow think that your SIL is the problem? 9 years old is way too old for tantrums.  Maybe spend less time thinking about them and start thinking more about what you're failing to do with your own child. 9 years old is more than old enough to know how to clean up toys/messes or to know to wait their turn before speaking. My own daughter is two and knows how to pick up her toys and put them away or help me clean. Most of the time, I don't even have to ask her to. She just sees me cleaning and volunteers to help.

I mean OP. \n\nAnd I think the main take home here is, this is ty an isolate incident, by your own admission, your husband and you have had to miss out on things due to your sons behaviour.

Yes, children should run and play and shout, but they should not do so in classrooms, or in restaurants, or weddings. My daughter was taught \u201ccruise matters\u201d when she was five years old. It absolutely delighted her to be able to dress up in a fancy dress and go to dinner I know which fork to use and not know how to behave politely so that she could sit with the adults and have a \u201cfancy\u201c meal.

My husband has a younger sister (SIL, 35f) who has two children (8f-6f). She and her husband are, in my opinion, pretty strict with their daughters. They're both psychologists, but I don't think they know what they're doing. These are some rules they enforce on them in public:\n\n1. Raise their hands to speak and wait for permission.\n2. Don't interrupt adults when they're talking.\n3. Leave everything where it was after taking/playing with/moving it.\n\nEveryone praises their daughters for being so well behaved, but I think they're cruel. I've never seen them running, screaming or crying. They play with other children well, but always clean up afterwards, and if they don't behave, my SIL gives them an angry look and they stop immediately. I admit that my son is not the best behaved when we leave the house, but at least he acts like a kid. It's normal for them to be loud, messy, throw a tantrum once in a while and interrupt others. They even act like that when their parents aren't around and I feel sorry for them. They don't seem to be unhappy though.\n\nMy husband's brother got married a few days ago and the invitations said it was a childfree wedding, so we left our son with a babysitter. Like I said before, he doesn't behave well in public, and I knew he would throw a tantrum, so I decided not to fight it. But my nieces were at the wedding, both of them as flower girls. I asked the bride in private later and she said *\"Yes, it's a childfree wedding, but they're the exception. They're well behaved and I know they won't make a mess, unlike others\"* with a smile, referring to my son between lines. I understand her reasons, but that comparison was unnecessary.\n\nI feel like my son was unfairly excluded for behaving like a child. I talked about it with my SIL later and she didn't know it was a childfree wedding, since the bride included her daughters without any issue. However, she agreed that my son wouldn't be able to behave well at a formal event and that perhaps I should *\"teach him how to act in public\"*. That bothered me. I told her that I would rather have my son being happy than be a \"dictator\" mom like her, because she's clearly abusive towards her girls.\n\nSIL didn't say anything, just looked offended, took her daughters and left. But others sided with her, calling me jealous because her daughters are well behaved and sweet while no one can stand my son. Everyone agreed and no one defended me or my son. So far, I've received calls and texts saying that I owe SIL an apology, that I was rude, bitter and a bad mother.
