My 3yo son is also terrified of the dogs because they\u2019re bigger than him and like to get all over him. Also Amaya allows her dogs use anything as a chew toy so my brother and I have had to throw away SO MANY of our kids stuffed animals bc her dogs have chewed them to shreds (she never offers to replace them and says \u201coh it\u2019s just what kids do\u201d).\n\nOur mom and her dads wedding milestone anniversary is coming up and so my husband and I thought it would be nice to throw them a nice dinner party with the whole family, so I called Amaya to tell her the plans and politely asked her not to bring her dogs for the night and listed all of my reasons, and she just immediately blew up at me for \u201cpunishing her for not wanting human babies\u201d and I\u2019m \u201ctoo traditional\u201d to understand that being a dog mom is being an actual mother and she can\u2019t leave them behind.

I took my eyes off the crowd for a few seconds to look at something, and this maybe 3 year old toddler sprints out of the crowd. She throws herself at him, arms around his neck with her face shoved into his and yelled 'doggie!' right in his ear. I nearly died. The kids mom had same horrified face I'm sure I was making. My boy huffed and wagged his tail. After some cuddles, the toddler patted his head, said 'good doggie', and went back to her mom. It took about 10 minutes for me to stop shaking because I knew how much damage those teeth could do. My boy got all the cheese treats he wanted that day.", "Oh god, what kids will do! Her mum was probably having minor conniptions too. Can keep an eye on them, but they can be speedy little monsters when something catches their attention!\n\nHopefully she grew out of that before something chomped her."]}
