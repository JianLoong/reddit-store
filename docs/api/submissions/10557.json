Dogmoms get petsitters just like moms get babysitters. She is acting completely unreasonable.", "NTA. Amaya has been coddled by your family long enough. Dogs are not children. They will die and be replaced, and they will not be welcome as \"family members\" at nice events. \n\nAsk your deluded sister how much she pays for daycare, if she is saving up for braces and Disneyworld and college, and how well the dogs are coming along with reading and writing. Since they're \"her kids\" and all. \n\nI have no patience for such nonsense.", "NTA. Your sister\u2019s gone over the edge and might need some help. That being said, I know way too many people who seem to think dogs are just tiny people in costumes. Treating dogs like they\u2019re people screws them up. I would throw myself in front of a damn train for my dogs, and I still treat them like dogs. That\u2019s the way to show respect for what they are, how they function, and how they see the world. Being a dog is a beautiful thing, and I\u2019d never take that away from them by pretending they\u2019re something they\u2019re not.", "NTA, obviously.\nBut since acknowledging the dogs as her children is clearly important maybe you can humor her once in a while. You can occasionally plan activities in a park or some other more dog friendly environment, and baby talk to the dogs in front of her to make her happy. I don\u2019t know, this is such a weird situation. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nAmaya... Might need some deeper help.\n\nI know dog owners who will call their dogs their \"furbabies\", but they don't stop treating them like dogs. Because they're *dogs*.\n\nNo seating at kids tables or shit. At most, fun holiday cards - but I think that's always because 1) my family has always been about the cards and 2) cute dogs in Santa hats.\n\nAnd hell, even if they were human kids destroying your kids' toys, I'd still insist she pay it back.\n\nI mean, it sounds to me like Amaya has some deep seated issues she's either projecting onto her dogs and your family, or she actually is just trying to mock you every time.", "Wow your kids are literal humans! That is impressive. I guess that means they read a lot?", "Has anyone ever met a \"my pets are my BabIEs\" pet owner who is actually doing a good job of parenting them? It's not (just) that they expect their furbabies to be treated like children, it's that they constantly act like the main characters on /r/entitledparents.", "Yeah,  I have-- lots of millenial parents have well-behaved pets.  \n\nSource: Sister is \"mother\" to a well-behaved doodle while I am pet owner to a fairly poorly behaved german shepherd mix,  heh.", "Yeah, it\u2019s hard not to engage because it\u2019s so f\u2019n bonkers, but this is the best approach. \n\nSomething is not right here, and the dogs have become part of some kind of delusion. Drawing a line between supportive and enabling is tough. The best thing for YOU to do is set firm boundaries that are about you and your family, not her and her dogs, per the language above.", "I\u2019d suggest you encourage you kids to draw on her walls as \u201cthat\u2019s just what kids do\u201d \u2026 but I am a petty A H so don\u2019t take my advice", "NTA. I would honestly be furious if someone fed their dogs next to my kid. I have german shepherds and am a huge dog person but 1. Thats gross and 2. I believe dogs and kids should be separated when dogs eat because some dogs get territorial of their food. They are not humans and it\u2019s dangerous to liken them to humans. It is our responsibility as dog owners to meet their needs psychologically, not expect them to meet ours.", "I joke around with my dog like this. He's an 8 Yr old pom. I say you're a real human baby, yes you are, it's not your fault that you're so ugly that you look like a dog, it's not yoir fault you're so stupid they don't let you go to school. You poor thing. You're a real human baby! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\n\ud83d\ude05\n\nIt's just a joke. I talk random crap to him in a cute voice because it makes him happy. I guess it's the emotional energy and the focus on him that he likes and makes him feel good. Fortunately he doesn't comprehend speech \ud83d\ude05\n\nDogs are not human children. I refer to my dog as my dog child.", "Agree. We have a lot of animals and it\u2019s a lot work. Especially when dogs are little puppies they require ALMOST as much attention as a human toddler. But for like\u2026 a month or so. Also it\u2019s generally discouraged to crate human children and leave them for several hours. So while it\u2019s not a negligible amount of work at times it\u2019s nowhere near the effort, drama, and expense of having even the chillest of small children.", "It's honestly kind of creepy when you meet someone who seems to really, genuinely believe it. I have a cat. He is a super spoiled cat. I talk to him all the time with things like 'did you miss Mummy all day? I bet you missed Mummy!' but, like, I'd never expect anyone to treat him the same way they treat a human child and he's not my child, he's my pet. Lmao.", "Being sensible though, you are NTA I am child free by choice and LOVE dogs, like a lot  \u2026 dogs are not grandchildren  \n\nThey have different needs\n\nNot saying your sister does this but It makes me sad when people have to take their dogs everywhere, even places they shouldn\u2019t, I used to work in a dog friendly pub \u2026 no dog ever looked happy to be there on a busy Saturday I\u2019ll tell you that! The amount of people I\u2019ve seen refer to their pets as fur babies but then I\u2019ve stopped their baby running out the door and onto a busy main road is crazy \nEqually I did once have to ask parents to look after their human children who were playing on said busy main road (parents when eventually located were upstairs at the back of the pub with no sight on their human kids)", "Hoisted by her own petard !!", "Only if they wear bow ties", "Right, you're not letting him pounce toddlers and starting a 529 account for him", "I'll have full conversations with my sister's dogs whenever I house and dog sit. They just stare at me like I'm a fruit loop.", "We have 2 large dogs and 4 cats, all spoiled. It's work, but I have nibblings. Furbabies are not comparable to human kids. Children take so much time, love, patience, negotiation, diplomacy..... I'm getting tired just listing it.", "Bow ties are cool.", "\ud83e\udd23 I don't know what a 529 account is but I'm going to run to google to learn and set one up for my wickle baby \ud83e\udd23\n\nDogs should never be allowed near toddlers imo. My dog is small and generally great but just about a month ago, I was a bit drunk and I must have pissed him off because he bit my nose. One cannot guarantee that a dog is safe at all times.\n\nWhen people come to my home, I put him in the bedroom."]}
