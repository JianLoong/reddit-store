Since the day she met him, it has been pure chaos. He\u2019s round the house a lot and barely says 2 words to my family when he\u2019s here. But besides the point, in the past 2 years he has cheated on her, stole money from her, and tried to make fun of her appearance. My sister and I are black, her boyfriend is white. Adam cheated on her with another white girl called Rose. Rose I guess having some girl code messaged my sister all the messages between her and Adam and in the messages he is seen making fun of my sisters braids, saying how he always gets \u201cbrown\u201d makeup on the sheets and hates it. Just really immature, petty, racist things. I asked my sister all the time why she doesn\u2019t break up with him, he is holding her back. He doesnt have a job, he takes her money, doesnt \u201callow\u201d her to see her friends.  She spent more time crying over him than doing anything else. She says \u201cif he doesn\u2019t want me who will\u201d and that she will \u201cbe bored\u201d without him. I\u2019ve told her many times how dumb she is and that this guy is clearly using her but she doesn\u2019t see it. I hated seeing her upset all the time so I thought to take matters into my own hands. I told Adam to break up with her and not contact her again or I will tell everyone something that he told my sister not to tell anyone about him. He agreed and stopped texting, or returning any of my sisters calls. It\u2019s now been 2 months, and she just found out that I was the reason he stopped texting and now she won\u2019t talk to me. In this 2 months she was so much happier, glowing even. Initially she was upset of course but I saw a massive weight off her shoulders.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nI know I\u2019ve told her that she\u2019s dumb (like the way most sisters speak to each other) but I\u2019ve also told her she\u2019s beautiful and deserves someone 100x better as well.
