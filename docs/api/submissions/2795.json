I excitedly told my family and my sister-in-law (30F) asked if she could be my wedding planner. She said that she has showed some interest in it and wanted to use my wedding as a test run. I gently declined, explained that we wanted a very small and intimate wedding and while I would still love for her to be involved in some of the planning I didn\u2019t need a planner. I kept my word, I asked her to be one of my bridesmaids, her daughter (1F) to be our flower girl and have included her in everything the other bridesmaids were included in. For some background I was one of her bridesmaids when she got married to my brother, while I was excited, I wasn\u2019t included in anything that the other bridesmaids were included in. She told me what color to get my dress in, what time to be there to help set up, and who I was walking with and that was it. So knowing that feeling I made damn sure I didn\u2019t do the same to her. A month ago I made appointments for my fianc\u00e9 and I to look at venues, because my mom offered to pay for the venue as a wedding gift she was invited and so was my MOH. We made a day of it, took lots of photos and my mom asked all the right questions that I didn\u2019t even think to ask. We had a great time and my mom posted our selfies all over her Facebook excitedly. Please note, this was just the four of us, none of my bridesmaids were invited to this particular part of the planning. A week later I had gone to my brothers house to catch up with my SIL and visit my niece, she asked questions about the venues I looked at and what I was leaning towards more. As I was explaining it to her she had to change the baby and while gone my brother blew up on me about how horrible I was being to her and how upset she was that she wasn\u2019t invited to look at venues with me. He said I was an AH especially because she offered to be our wedding planner. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t mean to hurt her feelings but it was hard to get a word in and he \u201cyelled\u201d at me about this up until she came back where I quickly said my goodbyes and went home. Apparently this made him even more upset and he reached out to the rest of our siblings who some are agreeing that I was definitely an AH. Was it really that bad that I didn\u2019t invite her? Should I apologize to her?

You don't want a real planner why would you want someone to experiment by using your wedding? You haven't been rude, you haven't left her out. Your brother is more than likely mad for 2 reasons. 1. He has to hear all her complaints she doesn't take to you because she knows how unfair and whiny they'd sound. And 2. He expected you to cow to his angry demands and you didn't. You aren't wrong, keep your boundaries. This day is not about them!", "What kind of demented family do you have?  You have done nothing wrong.", "NTA. Your brother and SIL owe you an apology.

For most of my wedding planning, I found that it's better to have fewer people there so you can think about what you want without having to hear a bunch of opinions. But regardless of that, no one is entitled to go with you to do any type of wedding planning. Tell SIL and your brother that if she really cares that much, they can have a vow renewal, and she can use that as her \"test run\"", "NTA. You decide how and where you want your wedding. Your wedding is not a test run for your SIL to gain some experience in the field. Your brother and other siblings who are siding with him are A-Hs and need to get a reality check. Would they let an inexperienced person handle their wedding?", "she didn't include you in planning, which is her choice, and you accepted it. she wanted to plan yours as a \"test run\" for her business, not because she cares or wants to help. she wanted to scope places and get connections. your nta. she's in your wedding, and that is all she is entitled to, but you weren't required to even have her in that. it's your wedding and your day. don't listen to nay sayers.", "NTA, the only information that the prior context gives is that you two don't have a good relationship. Whether or not you two had a good relationship, she's made it clear the only reason she wants to do this is so that she can play around and find out information. She's already made it clear that her interest is not in making sure you and your partner have a good wedding.\n\nIt sounds like you need to shine up your spine and tell everyone else to back off. Your wedding is not about her. It's about you and your partner. The priority in the planning should not be to make her happy, and your brother is selfish for trying to make everything about her", "Yep, because half the brides I know think after their wedding, that wedding planning is their new calling. Plot twist: It isn't and usually botch the hell out of the test run when the bride dares to have her own ideas instead of letting the planner recreate their own wedding over and over. Don't feel badly about this, but do know this will forever impact your relationship.", "Continue to ignore their inappropriate behavior. Keep her as a bridesmaid and of course keep them invited.

Have a blast on your wedding day and don\u2019t allow anything or anyone to ruin your day.", "Look at it this way, your wedding is supposed to be full of people who love and care about you and want to celebrate the Day with you. Why invite people who are telling you they don't care about your feelings?", "He yelled at her because she's not catering to them with her wedding. It makes me wonder if he's used to yelling getting him his way.", "This right here.

You included her more then you were included, you didn't invite everyone else in the wedding party. She wasn't the only party member not there, and she doesn't have a right to be there, just because she offered to plan your wedding.", "NTA - you delcined her offer. And bridesmaids do not usually go look at venues with the bride UNLESS it is the MoH or a best friend (and only if asked to accompany - it's not a given).\n\nShe basically just wants to go with to get info for own reasons, not to actually be of help to you. Since your brother is so up in arms, HE should offer to go with her to look at places. But it's not your job to soothe her ego and aspirations while looking at stuff for your own wedding.\n\nI'd text him that due to his verbal abuse and both of their entitlement issues, it may be best to lower contact for a while.", "NTA, and if your fiance and his family think you did anything wrong, you have more serious things to think about than picking out a venue.", "NTA. Personally I'd rethink her involvement completely but I suspect you're a nicer person than me.", "Since ner brother blew up at her while SIL was out of the room, I'm wondering if it's more of a *him* problem than SIL's.  There's a chance that she's (more or less) fine with the situation and that he got bent out of shape due to a perceived slight. <shrug>", "I had just graduated high-school and was working part time so I couldn't afford the $300 dress\ud83d\ude05 to be honest I'm not sure if my brother even knows about any of the stuff that happened but I guarantee it wouldn't make a difference if he had", "I personally think it\u2019s a *they* problem. I wonder if SIL cried and vented to OP\u2019s brother about how \u201cfamily is supposed to help family, but she\u2019s technically not my family so could you be the bad guy for me so she is guilted into letting me plan her wedding?\u201d\n\nOP\u2019s brother waited until SIL was out of the room and started attacking OP. Conveniently SIL comes back into the room and he doesn\u2019t stop, but OP said nothing about how SIL reacted to his outburst. On top of that, the family members are attacking OP. Once again, SIL is not saying anything to stop the attacking of OP. Their tactic is to build pressure and guilt onto OP so SIL gets what she wants and is using her husband/OP\u2019s brother as a conduit.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t involve her in any kind of planning just like she paid no mind to OP when OP was a bridesmaid at her wedding. She doesn\u2019t care about OP\u2014she cares about herself and is opportunistic."]}
