{"id": 21036, "submission_id": "14nr78a", "title": "AITA for turning my grandmother into the police?", "selftext": "I, 31 female, turned my 68 year old grandmother into the police for stealing nearly $180,000 from her father. Eight years ago I moved in with my great grandfather to take care of him. I was his sole caretaker for 5 years before I met my now fiance. As things progressed with our relationship my grandfather had told me that I should move out and live my life, he didn't want to be a burden. We had agreed that his daughter, my grandmother, would take my place and move in with him. Within the first few months she had moved him into a nursing home as his health was declining and she didn't feel comfortable taking care of him. I would stop by and see him whenever I had extra free time(practically everyday). Three months into him being in the nursing home I get a call from my grandmother, she's crying hysterical tears, saying my great grandfather had passed away. She went as far has writing up and printed off a fake obituary( didn't know it was fake at this time), and I believed her. My grandfather's wishes were to be cremated and spread in a forest, no funeral services. When I left we had made her his power of attorney for everything. My grandfather had a will that's been the same since I was 20, everything would go to me(I was the only grandchild that came to visit him without wanting anything in return). Two weeks after she had told me about his passing away she hands me a box with ashes(real ashes from a BBQ grill) and said that the lawyer was paying his medical and rent bills from the nursing home and would contact me when this was said and done. Okay, awesome. A year and half goes by and I notice my grandmother buying things she couldn't afford on her social security; a brand new 2022 Honda SUV, designer dogs, and many more. When I questioned where she got it she would beat around the bush or change the conversation to something else. One day on my way from a long day of working I drove by the nursing home, as it's a long the route I take home. They have a little deck area where patients and family can hang out, use a grillor light a small fire. As I drive by I seey uncle outside with my dead great-grandfather. The next day I called his lawyer and talked about everything. We go to the nursing home to talk to them about the situation, where we both find out that she hasn't paid for anything since he's been there. In the time that he was living there he had racked up a debt of $90,000. I immediately called the police and they came out. They collected all the items I had as well as the bills from the nursing home and opened a case. Days later we found out she had emptied his bank accounts and closed them all and over the course of 3 months slowly deposited that money into her bank account, which left a paper trail of everything she bought. The state ended up getting involved and is making me sell everything my grandfather had left to his name, which at this point wasn't much.

That is discusting behaviour! I mean she sounds like she has no respect for him at all and needs therapy. I dont know if she has alwasy been lile that or if its a mental break and the greediness of wanting money thats turned her that way. If she was desperate for money then she could have been supportive and caring of you all and then asked would it be ok to have a portion of the inheritance maybe. She stole from him and said he died. She needs a police cell tbh", "NTA\n\nWhat.... tf\nThat's a fucked women right there.\n\nBut why didn't your uncle say anything?", "holy shit that\u2019s some family drama. no, NTA, she committed a crime. but then again, what the *fuck*.", "NTA obviously", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

FInancial elder abuse is sadly quite common, and in my opinion anyone who does this should face the legal consequences.  \n\nIn addition by telling you your grear-grandfather had died she robbed you of spending time with him.  It's criminal and honestly just disgusting behaviour on so many levels.", "It's not a question of if she has always been like this.  If she's willing to do it, she's been like this forever.  She just didn't have the opportunity until now.", "He probably didn't know, but I doubt it. He was always her favorite child. Even his kids were better then the rest of her grandchildren", "Unfortunately it's not. But thanks for your input", "You were so close to your great grandfather that you literally took care of him.\n\nYour grandmother told you he was dead.\n\nA YEAR AND A HALF LATER you happen to see him hanging out with your Uncle BBQing? You didn't speak to anyone else in your family about your dead great grandpa? He never tried to contact you? No one else contacted you about grandpa?!\n\nFinally, he also had a will leaving you as the SOLE HEIR! This despite clearly having a child, grandchildren, and great grandchildren as you alluded to in your story.\n\nDude you are a liar or spinning the actual truth so badly that its no different than a lie. In the lonnnnnng stretch of this actually being true YTA anyway"]}
