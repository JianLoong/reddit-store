He wrote out a will where he left instructions of what he wanted me to have after he was gone (a keychain my grandparents bought him that he had for more than 20 years, his dog tags from his time in the military, this bracelet that he got when he became my dad, a little bobblehead toy from his brother who died in the military, a lighter that had been passed down through multiple generations of his family and an old school pocket watch also handed down through the family). My mom remarried after dad died. My half sister is now 8 and my half brother is 5. My mom decided she was not going to honor my dad's wishes. I have his dog tags. But she gave my half sister the keychain and she wants to give my half brother the lighter and the pocket watch. I begged mom not to but my half sister has the keychain. She was so happy.

I told her that wasn't my choice.\n\nMom told me I had a nasty attitude about it and the last couple of years have been intense. My half sister keeps showing off the keychain and talking proudly about how I shared it with her. She lost it once.

She's still a kid so we can't blame her. But your mom? She's on another level of assholery.\n\nEven if she made you share money from your dad, it wouldn't have done much damage to you (I'm guessing), but sharing personal items from your dad when they have no connection to your dad is a messed up thing to do.\n\nWhen you eventually move out, try to have some contact with your half siblings (whether you go LC, NC with your mom) if they start to respect your boundaries, coz as I said they're not to be blamed.", "NTA>Your mom is a Royal AH.
