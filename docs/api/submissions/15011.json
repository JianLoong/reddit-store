Because it seems like your mother may have put into your sister's head this idea of you sharing your dad with her. You need to have a calm conversation, no snapping at the kid, no fighting her, and you'll probably get a more empathetic reaction out of her.

Your kind of are being an ass to your siblings by taking out your frustration on them.

I love you mom but I will not forgive you for this.\"", "If it's legalized with a notary there will be a copy at the notary, and at your local state registry where contracts and such are being stored. Do your research, but to access it you'd probably have to be of legal age, otherwise it will be impossible without legal guardian present.", "You could try to get in contact with someone he served with. A local veteran's organization might be able to help if you contact them and explain the situation. \n\nBeyond that, your best bet might be to convince your mom and sister to respect your dad's wishes. I think that, unless this is part of a larger pattern of choosing your siblings over you, your mom isn't truly grasping how important it these things are to you. (Im guessing at feelings here, but you get the idea). Make it clear to her that it's not that you don't love your siblings and see her as siblings and want to share things with them, it's that her giving away the only connections you have to your dad and his whole side of the family feels like it's erasing part of your history and half of who you are. Explain to her how deeply hurt you are that she thinks it's more important for your siblings to have that connection than you. Also, explain how hurtful it is that she wouldn't trust it to you when you were eight, but she does trust it to your sister at eight (eight year-olds lose things). The fact that she did that also makes me wonder what her motives are. Does she feel like they're a part of *her* history that she wants to share with her other kids? If that's what it is, explain that they still have her *and* their dad, and how her refusing to honor your dad's wishes makes you feel erased. Your dad left these things to you, and since he's gone, honoring that and cherishing those things feels like the only thing you can really do for him.", "It doesn\u2019t say how old you are.  If you\u2019re in high school, talk to a teacher or a friend\u2019s parent.\n\nIf you\u2019re an adult, talk to an estate lawyer. \n\nYou can also post this on the legal advice sub.  They may know who is best to contact.", "I'm 16 so a couple of more years. Honestly, if any of that stuff gets lost or broken then nothing will ever make me have anything to do with any of them again. As it is I am pretty sure I won't have anything to do with any of them when I do move out. But that would be the final blow.", "This is the way. Except don't pretend you're fine with it. Raise hell just as you would if it were lost.\n\nAlso, if in US, check into your states law on safety deposit boxes. Many states allow a minor to get a safety deposit box even when they can't get a bank account, especially since your 16, which seems to be allowed by more states.", "Ugh, I had a feeling I would need to wait. Two more years until I can legally do anything then.", "For whatever else you STILL have in your possession, you need to FIND AWAY TO HIDE IT OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE, away from FROM YOUR Mum\u2026 then work REALLY HARD AND MOVE AWAY FOR COLLEGE\n\nThen go NO CONTACT\u2026 your mum is a real piece of work", "Opie I wouldn't blame you if you went no contact with them ever again. Because what your mother did was terribly disgusting and horrible of her and I hope that she will learn her lesson when she in turn loses her daughter when you never speak to them again.", "Don't look back. They're already toast for this. Find better people.", "Bide your time, get a job and start saving to move out. Before you leave take your stuff back and don't look back.", "I totally understand your situation and your anger. But I just wanted to note not to take it out on your siblings. They're just children. Unfortunately, this situation may cause a disconnect from them, but that is the fault of your mother, not the small children she has convinced have a right to your dad's (and your) property. They aren't old enough to fully understand the situation and the feeling of losing   \na parent (to my understanding).", "I hate that you have to do this- but if you are subtle about it you could steal it back from them and hide it some where your mom won\u2019t look for it (can you trust a friend?) and then pretend they lost it? \n\nIf you do fake them loosing it, just blame your mom for letting them have it in the first place. Don\u2019t lay too much anger on the kids who aren\u2019t at fault for your mom spoiling them.", "I would start getting your finances in order (in this case, finding a job and saving up enough money to move out). If she has a college fund set up for you, I\u2019d consider waiting until you use that up first before you go nuclear and sue her in court.\n\nOr if there\u2019s somewhere you know you can keep it safe, I\u2019d steal it now and have a full blown meltdown about how your sister lost it *again*.", "Smh, my sleep-deprived brain read this as \"they're already toast. Find butter people.\" \n\nAnd I actually thought yep butter people are the right kind of people. hahaha"]}
