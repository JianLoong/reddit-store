You need to have a calm conversation, no snapping at the kid, no fighting her, and you'll probably get a more empathetic reaction out of her.

Also, explain how hurtful it is that she wouldn't trust it to you when you were eight, but she does trust it to your sister at eight (eight year-olds lose things).

There will come a day when you can afford and express your own independence. It will come with a whole new set of burdens, but at least you\u2019ll be free.\n\nThe thing that will most *stop* you from being free later in life is not the absence of these heirlooms. It\u2019s being a bitter person who can\u2019t survive without validations and possessions.\n\nI don\u2019t expect you to understand, but just do yourself the favor and **no matter what you do, don\u2019t do it unless it is motivated by peace, love, and virtue.** Don\u2019t make any decisions out of fear and anger when you have other options. \n\nDo what you have to do, but don\u2019t do it angry. Do what you have to do, but don\u2019t do it bitter. And when the retribution lands, react with integrity.\n\nNothing will make you as strong as a flexible mind and perseverance.\n\nYou will never forget your father, and he will always live in you. You were absolutely his most valuable possession. Not a lighter. He is more in you than anything else.", "Yep, get a copy of the will, get all the items, and hide them somewhere together"]}
