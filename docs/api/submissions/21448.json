We have 3 kids together (7 M), ( 4 M) and (2 F), because of this my wife has put on some weight but I don't care  because I love her regardless of her body. I met my wife when I was working as a doctor's assistant and she was a receptionist, I knew I had wanted to marry her only five months after dating. My wife has become insecure over her weight and her stretch marks, but to me her body is perfect. Whenever I try to be intimate with her, she pushes me away because she doesn't want me to see her body. I do my best to assure her I love her no matter the odds, and I always try my best to make her happy. The kids also do their best as well to cheer mommy up. Yesterday was fourth of july, my wife's family invited us to pop fire works. It was a big cookout thing. My wife's sister, who I'm going to name drop because I fucking hate her. Mackenzie, was making slick remarks about my wife majority of the time we were there. I could visiblely tell it was making her uncomfortable, but the moment she really pissed me off when my wife was still hungry and going back for seconds and she had said \"how do you manage to keep a husband eating the way you do\", my momma put down her plate and left crying. I went on a whole rampage talking about how she can't even keep a man, let a alone a man to take care of her and her shit head kids and all the crack she is sniffing is the only reason she's in her shape. And with that I grabbed a few to go plates, than made my exit with my kids right behind me. My wife had been sniffling in the car, I consulted her and reassured her how much I love her. I don't feel bad for what I said cause she needs to watch her mouth when it comes my wife, I just want to know if I'm the asshole because her family keep calling her phone saying I need to apologize, and I see my wife is even more upset over their calls.

Normally I'd never be in favor of mocking addiction or romantic problems but sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire.", "NTA\n\nYou sir redeem all the fuckery I\u2019ve read on here today. Not all hero\u2019s wear capes, she is lucky to have you and maybe time to go no contact with bitter jealous McKenzie", "NTA. You defended your wife, who has body image issues. I think you did the right thing in standing up for her, especially because this probably isn't the first time this has happened. Good for you!", "NTA - I applaud you for defending your wife, especially when you know  that she is having a tough time of late.  If the rest of family are saying you need to apologize then screw them too.  No one should have to put up with this and good on you for being her knight.  Whilst she may not say it to you, she knows how much you love her and and how much you have stood up for her.  Keep doing what you're doing, keep reassuring her, keep helping her, but maybe broach seeing a therapist to get her some self esteem help. NOTHING to do with weight just some help in how to put up boundaries and increase her self esteem.", "NTA.\n\nHell yes I support this message.", "NTA you defended your wife, like a man should do.", "Nta, you did the right thing.

People have gotten way too comfortable running their mouths without getting slapped for it.", "**NTA**\n\nI don't understand why anyone would expect you to apologize for anything you said to someone who intentionally tries to belittle someone else.   What is with this family, is everyone similarly dismissive of your wife's feelings?   If the things you said were even half true, they ought to be telling SIL to apologize, or at a minimum keep her mouth shut.", "NTA. Sounds like Mackenzie learned a lesson: play stupid games, win stupid prizes. She got exactly what she was dishing out.
