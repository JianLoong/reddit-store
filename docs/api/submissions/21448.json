We have 3 kids together (7 M), ( 4 M) and (2 F), because of this my wife has put on some weight but I don't care  because I love her regardless of her body. I met my wife when I was working as a doctor's assistant and she was a receptionist, I knew I had wanted to marry her only five months after dating. My wife has become insecure over her weight and her stretch marks, but to me her body is perfect. Whenever I try to be intimate with her, she pushes me away because she doesn't want me to see her body. I do my best to assure her I love her no matter the odds, and I always try my best to make her happy. The kids also do their best as well to cheer mommy up. Yesterday was fourth of july, my wife's family invited us to pop fire works. It was a big cookout thing. My wife's sister, who I'm going to name drop because I fucking hate her. Mackenzie, was making slick remarks about my wife majority of the time we were there. I could visiblely tell it was making her uncomfortable, but the moment she really pissed me off when my wife was still hungry and going back for seconds and she had said \"how do you manage to keep a husband eating the way you do\", my momma put down her plate and left crying. I went on a whole rampage talking about how she can't even keep a man, let a alone a man to take care of her and her shit head kids and all the crack she is sniffing is the only reason she's in her shape. And with that I grabbed a few to go plates, than made my exit with my kids right behind me. My wife had been sniffling in the car, I consulted her and reassured her how much I love her. I don't feel bad for what I said cause she needs to watch her mouth when it comes my wife, I just want to know if I'm the asshole because her family keep calling her phone saying I need to apologize, and I see my wife is even more upset over their calls.

If the rest of family are saying you need to apologize then screw them too.  No one should have to put up with this and good on you for being her knight.  Whilst she may not say it to you, she knows how much you love her and and how much you have stood up for her.  Keep doing what you're doing, keep reassuring her, keep helping her, but maybe broach seeing a therapist to get her some self esteem help.

People have gotten way too comfortable running their mouths without getting slapped for it.", "**NTA**\n\nI don't understand why anyone would expect you to apologize for anything you said to someone who intentionally tries to belittle someone else.   What is with this family, is everyone similarly dismissive of your wife's feelings?

Good for you for standing up for your wife!! Good for you for assuring your wife shes gorgeous and you love her.. even when she struggles to love herself. It might be a nice gesture to call/message your wifes parents and say something like \u201c im sorry for causing a scene and leaving, but i will not sit by and let someone insult the woman i love. I hope you understand.\u201d", "Does her family require the sister to apologize to your wife? I\u2019m guessing no which means they are really only upset because you rocked the boat and now sister is losing it. Oh well. Good for you.

Please, it sounds like your wife needs help feeling worthwhile and attractive, maybe see if she would like to see a counselor.

I would have flipped out too if someone insulted my partner like this.", "Nice work, OP. Defend your wife from vicious relatives. And any sensible man would rather have a partner with stretch marks than addiction.", "NTA.  Your SIL has probably been treating your wife like this for decades.  This is why your wife has these insecurities (there may be other reasons, too).  Might I make a gentle suggestion that your wife seek support and healing through therapy?

Freaking sister was purposely hurtful and rude, made fun of her own sister in front of her kids and whole family...wtf....bit\\*h.\n\nFamily should be telling MAKENZIE to apologize for being so cruel.

If your wife is so insecure it's affecting her ability to be intimate, she needs to go to therapy and/or go on a diet. Having an extra couple pounds is normal, but nothing of what you describe sounds healthy and promoting quality of life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nb. That is also partly your responsibility. Further, your kids having to consistently cheer her up is highly inappropriate, borderline abusive. It's okay for parents to have the occasional bad day, and it's good for children to practice empathy sometimes, but if they are a consistent source of emotional comfort for their parents, that's a huge problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nc. Obviously your SIL sucks for a wildly inappropriate comment.", "NTA. and its called coke when you sniff it", "NTA.  Why were her parents ok with SIL treating your wife like that, but not you sticking up for her?  Is SIL the golden child?", "NTA", "NTA. I feel like you would do well to find out which love language your wife responds to.\n\nIt might be taking the kids out for the day and giving her a day to lounge around.\n\nIt might be sending her out with friends and she comes home to a clean house with dinner prepared.\n\nIt might be hiring a babysitter and going out for a date night.\n\nYou gotta find something to make her certain you love her and show her it's because...she is who she is and that's why you love her!\n\nThere is the obvious concern that the kids need to be considered when planning anything, so try to discuss this with her before you just up and book anything without anyone else's input. However, you should still have a reasonably complete plan ready before you ask for her to weigh in.\n\nE: I didn't expand upon anything related to your SIL because...it's not worth your time.", "NTA. That was an awesome schooling and Mackenzie needed it. I wish the fallout wasn\u2019t upsetting your wife and hope she can get some support through counseling that helps her see herself as the queen you clearly cherish her as. She may feel there\u2019s some stigma to that, please reassure her plenty of us need a little help postpartum for numerous different reasons. Wish you both well.\n\neta: grabbing to-go plates was a superb cherry on top", "YTA.  Should have grabbed more food on the way out from those idiots.  \n\nLove the way you defended you amazing wife and showed your kids how a husband loves.", "NTA - and you\u2019re a hero. Way to go, sir! Bonus points for grabbing food before leaving after that spicy speech lol", "NTA\nyour wife couldn't control that, and what Makenzie said was just wrong, she deserved it.", "NTA.   Maybe explain to your wife that every stretch mark is an indication she brought a miracle to this Earth and that those marks humble you and amaze you by her strength, love, and commitment to yourself and your children.  That her body should not be the same after childbirth and that she is more beautiful, sexy and loved because of them.   \n\nDon't let her interrupt, and don't let her scoff or say you're just being nice.    That demeans how you feel, whether she knows it or not. \n\nGood luck.    Fabulous job standing up for her against what's her name.", "NTA, not even close.

NTA", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02, If I had grabbed any more I would have had to start fighting the uncles.", "I can see what your saying but I'll like to clear a few things up \n\na) I have talked to her about the suggestions of therapy, she at the moment does not wish to go to therapy. She's trying her best at the moment. Just because my wife has some weight I never said she wasn't healthy. But I'm not going to discourage my wife eating what she wants to eat.\n\nb) my kids aren't consistently cheering my wife up, I mentioned they tried their best. My 7 year old usually is laying down with her, my 4 year old makes her cards and my 2 year gives her kisses. They are perfectly fine the way things are, just because my wife is insecure, she is not a mental patient. We show our kids love the best ways we can, but I will not stress my wife when I know she's not feeling well. The kids weren't happy what their aunt said to their mom, but the one who was fuming over it mostly was my 7 year old of course because he knows I will never let anyone talk to his mother like that and either should he. \n\nc) \u2764\ufe0f, Thank you!!", "Well then, I'm embarrassed!, I might have to text SIL and re-do my whole speech with her smoking coke in it.", "My wife's name is Dalila. I tell her that story already, she laughs in my face; but I can tell her smile says she loves when I say it.", "Her mom and dad were hosting, but I guess I did call the co-host a crackhead. I think I stood in it well, but best believe I'ma grab some food for my troubles before I leave", "It was awakard for them mostly not me, I didn't care because if your going to invite me over and let your idiotic daughter insult my wife (their other daughter) they would have had to stay ready, I should have just started picking up tins.
