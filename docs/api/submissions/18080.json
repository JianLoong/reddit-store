In high school my cousin \"Oliver\" (35m) admitted that he was into men while I told him that I supported him, it was best to keep it a secret until after our grandparents paid for college. Initially he agreed but then met and fell in love with \"Tom\" who refused to be treated as a secret and Oliver came out to please him. They disowned him and he had to drop out of college due to lack of funds.\n\nI felt terrible for him, I truly did. Especially since my grandparents were also sexist and treated him and our cousin Daniel as princes while the granddaughters (me and my female cousins) were treated less than, and Olive was the only one who would stand up for us. Because of this my cousins decided to ban together and tell our grandparents that they either needed to accept Olive or be cut out of our lives. If the circumstances/timing was different I would 100% be on board, but I was just getting ready for college. My parents didn't have any money saved for me and wouldn't be able to help and my cousins weren't going to help either.\n\nI tried to explain my reasoning but got berated and initially agreed to go along with it. However, on the actual day I chickened out and my grandparents disowned everyone but Daniel and me. I tried to apologize but my cousins didn't want to hear it and stopped talking to me. I sad but let it go because I did feel guilty. I only stopped when my cousins sent me a picture of myself at a LGBT+ friendly event and told me that they were going to expose me to our grandparents. I denied it when my grandparents confronted me and claimed that I was just passing through. It was an outside event so they bought it.\n\nFrom then on I would find out that my cousins would make terrible posts about me and I just gave up. A couple years later Daniel died so I got the lion's share of the inheritance when my grandparents passed. One of the first things I did once I got the money was make a donation to LGBT+ friendly organization(s) and made several posts about it. Shortly after my cousins heard and reached out to me about getting their fair share, but I told them after how they treated me I wasn't going to share a dime so AITA?\n\nETA: Because someone asked\n\n1. Over the years I did talk to my grandparents about reconnecting with my cousins but, short of groveling, my grandparents weren't interested.\n2. Again, I tried to talk it out with my cousins after the fact but short of groveling at their feet and telling our grandparents to f off they weren't interested.\n3. All of our parents knew about the situation and my parents agreed that it was best for me to play the long game. My cousins' parents either stayed out of it or agreed with me.\n4. As previously stayed, I did attend pro-LGBT+ events on campus so me donating the money that I did was nothing new or an \"attempt to settle my guilt.\" That was always the plan.\n5. Now that I'm older I do resent my cousins for trying to pressure 17 year old me into doing something and then using social media to harassing me about it for years.\n6. My cousins reaching out to me for money is the first time they've ever spoken to me directly in years.\n\nETA 2: Someone said that I should mention this here but I am the youngest out of all my cousins. My two female cousins already had their college paid for, while Daniel was taking a year off to travel (on our grandparents' dime).\n\nETA 3: I just wanted to be clear about something else. Some people here believe that I pretended to be openly anti-LGBT+, I wasn't. I never attended any of the hate groups that my grandparents would supported. I kept my distance from their bigoted friend kids/grandkids, I never used any of the slurs, I just kept my head down. After I graduated college I went VLC with my grandma (grandpa had died) and that was only because my parents begged me not to. I didn't even go to her funeral.

You had nothing saved for college and could get a free ride by pretending to agree with your grandparents. I get it. I also totally get your cousins taking a stand and supporting Oliver after he was disowned even if it meant getting disowned themselves. \n\nYour cousins went out of their way to try and get you disowned which is weird to me. Like, chances are your grandparents wouldn\u2019t have ever changed their mind even if you all agreed. None of you would have any money now. Yeah you would have morally been in the clear but financially you\u2019d be fucked. The fact that now they expect you to hand over money that if they had their way you wouldn\u2019t have gotten either is kind of fucked up. But again, hard to call them assholes when they were just standing up for Oliver and then got cut off for it. \n\nAt the end of the day, you did what you had to do to ensure you could go to college. I know multiple people who didn\u2019t come out to their parents/grandparents/family until after they got college paid for/inheritance. It\u2019s a calculated move. If my grandparents had offered to pay for my college I probably would have stayed in the closet until after I graduated to ensure they continued to pay for me too. Lucky (or unlucky, fuck you student loans!) I never had that chance so I didn\u2019t have to do that. \n\nSo long as it doesn\u2019t escalate more I\u2019m gonna go N A H \n\nETA: after OP\u2019s edit and comments making it clear that her cousins have continued to harass her for *years* over this I\u2019m changing my vote to NTA.

While it's very noble of your cousins to stand up to your grandparents and it would have been noble for you to do as well, it sounds likke they did not have the same financial dependence on your grandparents that you did and all the morality police on this sub are probably flaming you for not standing up to your grandfather and \"choosing money over family\" when it comes down to it, *not cutting ties with someone you are financially dependent on does not make you an asshole.* Maybe selfish, yes, but understandably so. \n\nNTA.", "So the older cousins already had their college paid by the grandparents for so they risk nothing by speaking up am I correct, except for inheritance when they died", "ESH\n\nYour cousins shouldn't have pressured you when you felt you had so much to lose.\n\nYou're a fake ally.

You reached out and tried to explain yourself and make peace with the grandparents and cousins multiple times and were always rebuffed\n3.

It's a cultural, social, moral judgement.

You chose supporting homophobia and the alienation of your cousin in order to get your college paid for. Legal? Yes. Moral? Not exactly.\n\nIt makes a lot of sense, then, that your cousins weren't friends with you after. You claiming that this makes your future behaviour okay is circular reasoning. You are the one that hurt them, and you are using their reaction to justify further hurt. That's some incredible victim mentality.\n\nYou were okay with donating to an LGBTQ organization, but not supporting your cousins who were actively impacted by discrimination? You aren't an ally, and donating doesn't make you one. Attending a rally and then trying to make it seem like you don't support it at all when it's \"discovered\" isn't being an ally.\n\nAll of the above was a dick move. I think it's true that you weren't fully culpable for it, since you were 17 at the time and trying to get college paid for. It's not that you absolutely should have done one thing or the other. But the path that you did choose was money over family and principle. And that does make you an asshole. Lots of 17 year old kids do asshole things. Now you are faced with the choice, again, to choose money or family. Legally, you are entitled to the money. Morally, you know full well that your cousins should have gotten equal pieces of the inheritance. You can choose between doing the selfish thing - keeping it all - or doing the kind and generous thing, sharing it with your cousins who would absolutely have gotten equal shares if Oliver wasn't gay.

Being able to look at the situation rationally, to justify your choices through logic can make you go along with some pretty awful things in the end.  eventually you have to have some sort of moral compass.  and if that compass leads you to dark places, you have to own up to it.  the hatred your family has for you is something you sort of earned through your own actions.  and i'm not wrong about the fact the money isn't going to fix it.\n\nIf you feel it's \"right\" to split the inheritance, split it, but don't do it if you think you'll be able to buy your way into their hearts and make up with them.  they won't make up with you, because their problem with you doesn't have to do with money.  it might make a start in mending bridges but you'd have a long way to go.\n\nSo as i said in my first post, why are you considering this?   you already alienated your family for this money, why are you doubting your path now?  the damage is done, the horse is out of the barn.  there is no taking back what you did.  you might never fix those relationships even if you give them the money.\n\nbut there is one thing i can promise.  if you chose not to share the money, you will never repair those relationships in the future.  so know that if you want a relationship with that part of the family.  not sharing this will probably be the final nail in that coffin.", "Your donation was nothing more than virtue signaling.

It doesn't sound like the grandparents had actually actively discriminated against members of the LGBT community until their grandson came out and OP backed that decision. She literally told her cousin to just stay in the closet. Yes, she was able to benefit by being at best a sneaky little liar who only occasionally used hate speech to please the homophobes, but she's certainly not a decent person. \n\nMaybe her cousins aren't stupid, they're just good people with a moral compass who realized what OP was doing was wrong? She used that to snag the lion's share of the inheritance for herself and then brag about making a donation to the community she was happy to call hateful slurs just a few years earlier. She's certainly not willing to give up the cash she ended up with because her cousins are better people than she is.", "Bingo! Kept quiet when it suited them and now hold OP responsible.

I will admit I'm not the most worldly person but every LGBTQ person I know who spent any time partially closeted got pressure from people who knew to come out. Mostly during that period of college where every kid thinks they're an activist with all the answers.  If he didn't make it to college with this one guy involved he sure as hell wasn't making it through IMO.", "He had no problem lying until some SO told him otherwise.", "Look, Oliver had no problem lying to y\u2019all\u2019s grandparents until his bf told him otherwise. I bet if you were to ask Oliver now, he wishes he kept his mouth shut.

Do you expect them to react to a coming out that hasn't happened yet?", "Gonna be honest. Not reading all that. By your logic, her cousins are happy to associate with bigots by talking to OP and getting the grandparents\u2019 money who are bigots. She attended those events because she\u2019s not a bigot. Lol you think a true bigot would even keep in contact with gay people & go to LGBT events. They would rather die. And again it\u2019s easy to say all this morally righteous shit when you have money and are in a stable position. If you\u2019re young and have no money, you need education to get a job. Not all people have the luxury to cut off people with differing views. And this logic is just stupid, I shop at Walmart and turns out CEO is homophobic, now I\u2019m homophobic if I need to shop at Walmart & don\u2019t have money to shop somewhere else?", "And the whole family knew grandparents were bigoted long before Oliver came out, but the cousins still took their money to pay for college.", "I\u2019m pretty sure all the cousins knew that the grandparents were homophobic.

And a hypothetical male cousin, who was 17 at the time, waffled about supporting you despite saying he felt terrible.

YTA you continued to value money over civil rights and lied to bigoted grandparents to \"earn\" that inheritance. Just because you were 17 doesn't mean you didn't know right from wrong. Siding with money over doing the right thing shows them who you really were and they had every right to vent over the hurt you caused them. Acting like a victim because they spoke I'll of you on Facebook while you pretended you were just as bigoted as your grandparents is ridiculous.  \n\nHonestly if you were my cousin I'd definitely feel owed part that money since you obviously lied to your cousins and if i was your cousin I'd constantly talk shit no matter how much you donated because donating to LGBT+ organizations doesn't change that you personally hurt your cousins.

Now split that money with your cousins.", "YTA. You made a money grab, and you have to stand in that. You chose that money over your family, and their emotions and reactions are the consequences.

You could have gotten loans and applied for grants, worked through school, lived small (yes it sucks, I did it myself and I\u2019m still paying on that goddamn student loan). Instead, you chose approval through nonaction. By not defending your cousin, you showed your grandparents you approved of their hateful way of thinking and you showed Oliver money was more important to you than him. Shame on you. Had you *all* been onboard supporting Oliver, it might have shown your grandparents their way of thinking was wrong. Maybe not but with two of you also looking like fellow bigots, your grandparents were validated. \n\nNow on to the issue at hand with the inheritance: Usually in these inheritance stories, I\u2019m 100% with the inheritor keeping the money as according to the deceased\u2019s wishes but your story is very different. You profited off hate and bigotry which was the only thing that kept your cousins from getting a fair share. Do you *have* to give them some? No. Should you? Absolutely, in my opinion. So you donated to an LGBTQ foundation, great. That\u2019s a wonderful thing to do. But don\u2019t you think it\u2019s kind of weird that you felt fine with donating to strangers but giving money to your own family is off putting to you? They are the ones who directly suffered your grandparent\u2019s hate.\n\nEdited to add: YTA", "YTA.\n\nI'm not even reading the other comments. You went against something you believed in (being an ally for the LGBTQ community) for the sake of getting your college paid for.

The VERY LEAST you could have done was split that money with the other 3 cousins to show solidarity.\n\nYou sound like a selfish brat, to be honest. You got your college paid for and THEN kept the remaining inheritance? Are you serious? You claim your cousins had been harassing you on on Social Media for years yet, you INTENTIONALLY donated to a cause that you knew they would see on a public platform as if to purposely get under their skin. Not to mention, you LIED to your Grandparents about attending LGBTQ events! You are WORSE than your cousins!

I\u2019m gay and much of my family has been against it and I don\u2019t mind when other family members stay out of it because it\u2019s not their battle but I would be shattered if behind my back they were telling people they thought I was wrong and immoral. \n\nAlso, as a gay person, if you were my relative you would be dead to me.

They put you into an impossible situation at 17 - lose a life-changing amount of money, or back up your cousin.\n\nThis was not just a simple, \"Go along with your grandparents or lose your driving privileges for a week.\"  This was \"Go along with your grandparents or don't go to college\", which, again, is life changing.  Going to college or not going determines what you wind up doing with your life, what kind of job or career path you have, how well you'll be able to support yourself or a family as you get older.  Sure, people without college degrees can still work and have careers and be successful.  But quite simply, a college degree increases those chances.  Do you want to be a doctor or a lawyer?  Then you need college.\n\nAnd the price you had to pay for continuing your education was to stop publicly supporting your cousin when you were 17.  It's not Grammy and Grampy were going to deny you your weekly allowance of $50 a week.  This was \"toe the line or kiss a full complete college education goodbye.\"  Yes, there are assholes in this scenario, make no mistake, and those assholes are your grandparents.\n\nI don't think you owe your cousins anything.  While it's great that they supported Oliver, it's NOT great that they continue to harass you, sometimes publicly, and only talk to you when they need money.  They've shown their asses, you know?  Supporting your cousin does not give them a free pass to be abusive assclowns.", "NTA you had to make the best decision for yourself at the time.

Your grandparents were terrible people for being so bigoted, but your cousins also acted terribly to you. Expecting you to cave to their bullying and throw away college at the age of 17 based on principle isn\u2019t very fair.

At this point, your cousins made it clear they have no love or respect for you, so they\u2019re not entitled to your money.", "NTA. You played the long game in an attempt to help both yourself and everyone else, and had already seen what would happen if you didn\u2019t. And, also to be fair, it sounds as if you genuinely needed to stay on their good side so you could go to college. And the cousins trying to force you to go along with their plan while you were young was wrong on their part as well, as was holding it against you. And on top of that, their attempt to out you as their ally just to screw you over, that was a particularly heinous move on their part, especially since they already knew the consequences.\n\nSo all of that being taken into account, I\u2019d say you basically don\u2019t owe them a dime.
