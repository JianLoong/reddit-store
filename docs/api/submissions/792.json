But YTA. Parents think children pretend to be sick to stay home from school and waste time, tale old as time even before the internet was a thing. Your child is either staying home:\n- because they are actually sick\u2026 why does it matter if they have internet or not, they are in bed resting. Are they supposed to stare at a wall for 16 hours?\n- because they need a mental health day/couple of days. This is okay and is better than your children burning out. Why can they not use the internet that day compared to every other day?\n- because they don\u2019t want to go to school. This could be because of bullying, feeling isolated or depressed, not having supportive teachers or a multitude of different things. Your job as a parent is to make sure your child feels happy and safe, and get to the root of the issue. The internet is not the root of the issue.\n\nIf your children are acting out, getting bad grades, etc it is time to step in. This could include taking away the internet. But, arbitrarily deciding that your children cannot use the internet for reasons that only make sense to you will just make your children better at hiding that kind of stuff. \n\nBe fair don\u2019t be a dictator.", "YTA \n\nHello Mr. Control Freak. That was my parents rule (pre internet) and we were told if we were sick enough to stay home from school, then we were too sick to watch tv or listen to the radio. We weren't allowed to leave our beds either. Now how ridiculous does that sound?\n\nWhat do you do when you are home sick or take a sick day from work? Do you have the same rule for yourself?  \n\nPeople shouldn't go to work or school sick. It's spreading germs and wearing down their own bodies. There's a big space in between not being able to sit at a desk to learn, go to recess and gym class, walk the halls, sit at lunch, and not being able to drag oneself out of bed or view entertainment. \n\nI know you are afraid that they will have so much fun at home that they will fake it. Everyone has faked sick at some point in their life. You can still be a successful human being. I actually asked my kids not to fake being sick and gave them the power to take mental health days and be honest. They didn't abuse it and managed to graduate high school, college, and get good jobs.\n\nIt's not a reasonable rule.", "YTA sounds like you're punishing them for being sick. What did you used to do when you were sick at home?", "YTA\n\nWhen you're sick do you just lay in bed all day doing nothing because you need to \"rest\"? Or are you like every other normal human who is watching Netflix as they tool around on social media? Also, there's internet at school so it's not like they have zero access to it while at school.\n\nSuch strict rules are ridiculous and will only cause resentment.", "YTA- you can be sick, resting, and watching a movie or tv show (using wifi on a smart tv or your phone). \nOr if you have an apt and you\u2019re home, why is there a certain time when you can decide, okay! Internet time!\n\nLife is going to have bigger issues to deal with. How often does this really come up???? Not the hill to die on.", "YTA- this is going to have the opposite effect that you think it will... I was one of those kids whose parents were overbearing with screen time rules, and this gave me sort of a binge mentality- use screen time EVERY CHANCE I get, because it will not be available all the time.  \n\nNow as an adult, I struggle with appropriate screen time use because of these restrictions as a child.  I grew up, and now that I can use a screen as much as I want, I do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLay off your kids, let them be kids.", "YTA. If they're home sick you expect them to lay in bed doing nothing? Can they watch tv? If so...what's the difference? I scroll reels when I feel poorly. It's mindless and can help me feel not quite so awful or least take my mind off it. And when home for an appointment. Seriously? Again, why?", "YTA\n\nLord you sound so disconnected from reality. You're telling me they can't rest and browse the internet? I suppose they have to sit in their room in the dark, no TV, no video games.\n\nYou're basically punishing people for being sick.", "Most humans I know spend their sick days scrolling on their phones and watching Netflix. So unless you stay off your phone and devices when you're sick from work, YTA.", "YTA- you sound like a mid level manager grasping for control.", "YTA - it is very unreasonable.  There is no logic behind your rules.", "That's not a reasonable rule. You can rest and be on the internet. If they are home because of an appt, then they are home \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Can you set REASONABLE time limits based on their ages, yes  but goodness don't be so controlling. \n\nYTA.", "YTA if they're sick let them do things that don't make them more miserable. \n\nSeems like you're more concerned about them missing school and don't think they're necessarily \"sick\" when they miss.", "INFO: do you watch TV when you're sick?", "INFO: what do you do when you are too sick to do anything except stay in bed for 3 days straight?", "YTA, I'm a mom but this sounds like you just want your children miserable. I understand limiting screen time perhaps, but are they just supposed to lie in bed all day if they don't feel great? Not everyone can just sleep all day when they don't feel good.", "YTA.\n\nThis is giving....micromanaging and controlling.\n\nIf your kid is home sick, let them watch a show or scroll mindlessly. If they have an appointment, that I assume the parent booked, let them watch or scroll.\n\nFFS, if you are concerned with media consumption, look at what is already allowed.", "Do you stay off line when you are home sick or take off work for an appointment?", "You are being ridiculous. In the before times (80\u2019s and 90\u2019s) when I was home sick I watched tv all day. Usually on the couch with a blanket. Huzzah for The Price is Right! \n\nLater when we had a gaming system I\u2019d sometimes play games. \n\nNow, as an adult when I take a sick day I scroll my phone and stream Netflix. Maybe I\u2019ll fire up the Xbox. \n\nNot everyone can or wants to be isolated to their bed all day. Especially kids. ESPECIALLY when they are home for an appointment and not even sick!\n\nYTA", "YTA. Yes it's unreasonable.", "YTA \n\nPersonally I think it\u2019s unreasonable, they\u2019re sick, relax and let them kill time in a way that they want.", "YTA\n\nSo not asshole, but I don't agree with your rule. I get the spirit of the rule in not wanting to make staying home sick a treat, but I think it still depends on the circumstances.", "Lol... nobody on reddit wants their screen time limited. Maybe it's the wrong place to ask.\nI'm not sure what is a reasonable internet limit. What would you agree to if you were home sick?", "Yta that's not reasonable. You know what I do when I'm sick? Read, watch YouTube, watch Netflix.", "YTA\n\nsuch strikt rules are not really useful in the real world.", "This sounds like a question for a parenting subreddit", "INFO: if you\u2019re home from work sick, would you have no internet access either?", "YTA. \n\nWhat's the reason to not let them have internet time? \n\nThey are home sick or for an appointment, so you know why they are home. Why would you want to punish them for a situation that you know about or when they aren't feeling well?\n\nWhen you are home sick, or have free time, do you use the internet? Why are you treating your sick child like they did something wrong? Let the sick kids entertain themselves with some internet, it's no different then watching TV or a movie. Or do you just want them to suffer in a silent dark room?", "YTA sort of\n\nThe Internet isn't a bar of chocolate, or a medal. It's not a reward. It's just a utility.", "Yta! Why do some parent spend so much of their time TRYING to make life difficult for their kids. You can be sick AND watch tv. Part of the reason they stay home is to also keep other children from falling ill. Then y\u2019all wonder why they don\u2019t visit as often as adults or stick you in a nursing home. Stop making up weird rules just because you can. Y\u2019all STAY being your kids first bullies. I guarantee if you call in sick from work u get online or watch tv", "YTA...get over your archaic ideals. \n\nYou can rest while laying in bed with a tablet to keep you entertained to hopefully distract you from your misery.\n\nToo bad the kids can't use the internet to avoid the misery you bring them.", "YTA. Why are you doing this? Who cares! Find something else to occupy your time instead of monitoring everyone else's activities.\n\nNothing like being punished for being sick, by forbidding online access. Get a hobby, get a clue! My guess is that you are by far the most unpopular person in the household.", "YTA both for declaring a rule rather than working out a compromise with your partner, and for framing your rule as \u201creasonable\u201d, inherently making them unreasonable.", "INFO: How old are your children, and what is your idea of being home \"sick\"? Possibly contagious with sniffles, or throwing up and barely able to function?", "That's stupid.  If the \"internet\" is in a common area (where it should be), then what is even the problem.  YTA - set up parental controls if that's what this is about - otherwise, you're just being some control freak.\n\nLearn to pick and choose your battles more wisely - seriously.", "NAH Not at all, managing screen time is a good habit and steady rules are important for children.", "If I was too ill to go school I was to ill to watch programs.   It won't kill a child to miss Snapchat for a day.  How the hell are you calling op an ah.", "I grew up this way.  Except it was no nintendo or sega etc...  My parents said that if you are sick, then you are going to rest, nap etc...   They reasoned that if I was sick enough to concentrate on a video game, then I was able to also concentrate on school work, study, catch up assigments.  Now that Im older, I can agree with this view.  I didnt get to just sit around and party the whole day.  NTA", "NAH you see it as reasonable they don't. I would point out that while yes the internet can be a distraction it's also the best way to study by far", "NTA. Also a parent with kids who have specific, designed screen time (no devices that they control). We do no extra screens when they\u2019re sick. The screen time hours are the same (which are outside of school time). They can read, listen to audiobooks, play with whatever, ask us to read to them, etc. They\u2019re used to doing this on the weekend, and allowing sick time to be extra screen time would just mysteriously increase the rate of headaches and stomachaches.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My kids start working on their makeup work while they are home sick.", "INFO: What is he trying to accomplish, here? Has he ever explained?", "NTA - I would think no games console as opposed to no Internet as I know a lot of kids I grew up with would fake a day off if they thought they could stay home and play and its important that you are able to believe your kids when they tell you they're unwell but they should still have something to do, nothing wrong with a Netflix binge if you're poorly for example or an age appropriate Internet browse but probably not gaming", "So to clear some misunderstanding here, by internet I mean anything that isn't watching video entertainment one could do on a regular smart TV, Pluto, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and the like are fine. But say online gaming via console or PC is out. \n\nAnd I did grow up with a rule similar to this being no video games, with the exception being anything that was on TV was free to watch (mostly pre-internet/early days of waiting 5minutes for the dialup to work wasn't as interesting to me) \n\nThe ages of the kids range from 16-4. While the oldest ones do have cellphones, they aren't apart of this rule as we don't allow them to use house wifi just what they get from the monthly data to help them learn some self control for later in life. \n\nOh almost forgot, the sick would be flu like symptoms, pretty much anything you would normally get sent home from school for. High temps, nausea, upset stomach, migraines, stuff pretty much able to be handled at home without a visit to the ER.", "Not unreasonable.  But not worth arguing over.   Flip a coin, whoever wins decides.", "NTA, but maybe a bit controlling.  I don't know about you, but when I was sick as a kid I would be on the couch with a blanket and pillows where I spend the day sleeping and watching TV.  My kids don't watch a whole lot of TV shows, the internet has taken that place.  I don't see a reason the kids should not be allowed to use the internet while they are home sick.
