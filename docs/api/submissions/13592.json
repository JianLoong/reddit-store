She stayed with us for around 2 weeks I think, I don't fully remember how long it was.\n\nWhen she stayed with us, Emma brought her cat, Ted. She adopted him during the lockdown. He's around 7 years old now.\n\nWhen Emma left our place, she didn't bring Ted with her. She didn't even say anything about it, just one morning we woke up and she and all her belongings were gone and she left a note saying she went to go stay with her parents but Ted was still here.\n\nI called Emma many times but didn't get an answer. She didn't respond to me for around a week and told me that she can't bring Ted to her parents' house because her dad is allergic to cats, and asked if we could please look after Ted until her living situation is better. I agreed at first but after a couple of weeks Emma stopped responding to my messages or calls.\n\nI was honestly dumbfounded on what to do. My fianc\u00e9 was really mad at Emma and said that she needs to stop taking the piss and take responsibility for her own cat and I can't help but agree.\n\nWe didn't hear anything from Emma for another 5 months which brings us to now.\n\nAfter the first 2 months passed with no contact, we assumed Emma no longer wanted Ted as she never responded to my texts or calls.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have never really discussed wanting a cat, we aren't really \"cat people\", but Ted has grown on us over time and we've become quite attached. He's a lovely natured cat and seems really happy here living with us.\n\nSince then, I've gotten Ted neutered, microchipped and paid all his vet bills.\n\nYesterday, Emma rang me out of nowhere and said that she is coming on Sunday to pick up her cat. I told her \"you mean my cat?\". I told her she can't just abandon him and expect me to be happy to hand him over back to her like nothing happened.\n\nEmma argued with me and said that she didn't ababdon Ted, she was unable to keep him due to things out of her control and that's not her fault. I said it's not my fault either and I had to take responsibility for him this whole time.\n\nShe started crying and said she just wants her cat back and that I'm being cruel, and that she had other things going on. She begged me to give Ted back to her.\n\nI told her no and that Ted isn't her cat any more and that her actions have consequences and she should deal with it.\n\nEmma hung up the phone and since then I've not heard anything from her. I've gotten a few messages from our mutual friends asking what happened and saying that Emma is telling everyone that I stole her cat.\n\nIm feeling guilty now and wondering if I was being too harsh on Emma. I know she was going through a difficult time and everything.

Even if she had nowhere to keep him and couldn't afford to take care of him, she still could have contacted you. 5 months is a long time to be no contact, and without any other information, of course you assumed Ted was yours now and emotionally bonded with the cat. I don't understand how Emma could have never checked in if she cared so much about the cat. At least a text saying \"I know it's been a while, but I'm saving up and trying to get Ted back\" every week or some sort of update. \"Can you hold onto him for another month?\" \"How's Ted doing?\" \"Keep the receipts for Ted's vet bills! I'll try to reimburse you over time!\" Communication is key!", "NTA. She abandoned that cat. He\u2019s yours now.", "NTA, I had to stay at a shelter and leave my cat with my dad/brother. I talked daily and the second I could, I brought her home", "She's lucky you were willing and able to take care of the cat. I can't take care of a cat. NTA. Legal abandonment of animals is usually two weeks because animals have to be taken care of and can be very expensive. It would be too easy to trap people with pets for months at a time otherwise.", "I have friends looking after my boy between moves and I literally have a document written up about his schedule, and i promised to visit as often as possible. I couldn't imagine just leaving without him one day without some kind of foolproof care plan. Insanity!", "Yes, if it wasn't important enough to check on how Ted was doing, it's pretty much abandonment. And out of the blue, she just shows up. No offer of compensation, no asking how Ted is doing.", "Right? I would have been checking in weekly, supplying food, checking about health etc, if it's all going ok and they're still ok with the situation. Visiting if possible.\n\nOnly not more frequently because I would feel that could be overbearing annoying.\n\nThat would be valuing and loving the cat. Not dropping out of *all* responsibilities for FIVE MONTHS.", "UK here! Cats are actually considered property over here for some weird reason, so absolutely having a microchip in your name and address is proof enough that cat belongs to you. Although i feel like Australian's also say \"taking the piss\" so idk, maybe they're Aus?", "NTA. she should have been paying for his food/vet bills at the very least. Since she didn't he is now your cat.", "Stealing someone's cat is what someone I knew did, she moved out and took her roommate's cat with her. No note, nothing, just packed up cat and her stuff and left them; ghosted ex roommate. \nYou adopted a cat your ex roommate abandoned with you. She quit communication so in my opinion NTA. If I couldn't take my pet with me until I found another place to live, I would have been giving you supplies and visiting constantly. Her actions don't match her words.", "Y T A for not providing cat tax! Congrats on your new cat, now let us see him please.\n\nNTA at all, I am glad Ted has you and your fiance as his furever home.", "I wanna ask, how come in every single story related to friends, the friends are the most DUMBASS people I have ever possibly heard of in my life. The friends KNEW you were being bullied and said NOTHING but when you fight back now it's wrong and immoral.\n\nNTA and you should probably separate from those friends and find a new group who would accept you for who you are.", "Where\u2019s the Ted Tax?\n\nNTA. She didn\u2019t even bother to fix her 4 to 5yo cat?? It\u2019s been 5 months, this is a living creature and not a book or something.\n\nThe way a lot of people deal with situations like this is ask of the friend will pay all the costs for the amount of time they abandoned the animal. The person usually doesn\u2019t care enough about the pet to want to spend the money and just fucks off again.", "NTA pets aren\u2019t just possessions.  They have feelings and get attached.  Leaving a cat at someone else\u2019s house for over 5 months shows she doesn\u2019t care.  Ted is way better off with you.", "Nta", "NTA I don\u2019t care what is going on in my life - I would NEVER abandon my cats, and that\u2019s exactly what she did.  It was incredibly rude to you, especially after everything you did for her, but also awful that she didn\u2019t care enough about her cat to even pick up the phone. You could have given him to a shelter by that point for all she\u2019d have known, and indeed you would have been well within your rights to do so, because you DIDN\u2019T choose to get a cat. And now you\u2019ve given that cat a loving home, done things she should have done for him in the first place, and she has the nerve to ask for him back?! Fuck. That. Ted deserves a responsible family - thank you for giving that to him, and enjoy your kitty !", "Cat's original owner didn't even bother to neuter or have him microchipped. Emma didn't do jack for that cat. OP earned the right to keep Ted when she got him fixed and chipped. \n\n7 year old cat unfixed is irresponsible. Ted's better off with the OP. \n\nNTA.", "Yep, British English covers England, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, Scotland, Wales, etc. We Americans are the outliers. ;)", "Could you explain what taking the piss means please? I feel like I get the gist of it, but I\u2019m worried I\u2019m wrong and going to embarrass myself some day. \n\nAlso what does taking the Mickey mean? Is it the same thing? I\u2019d love to know what/who Mickey is.", "That\u2019s true but we don\u2019t say \u201ctaking the piss\u201d in Canada. That\u2019s UK/Aussie slang.", "If someone's \"taking the piss\" they're either teasing someone, or behaving terribly.  The former is generally mocking or teasing that's specifically *not* cruel or malicious, and the implication in the latter is that the behaviour is so egregious that it doesn't make sense for them to be genuine.  Basically you could swap it out with \"is this a joke?\" and it'd still make sense.\n\nedit: forgot to say \"taking the mickey\" is synonymous for \"taking the piss\".  My understanding is that it started as rhyming slang, being 'taking the mickey bliss' ie. 'taking the piss', but that could be apocryphal", "I\u2019ve never figured out what \u201ctaking the piss\u201d means.", "Thank you so so much!", "NTA. If she cared about the cat, she would have neutered and chipped him. If she cared, she wouldn\u2019t have gone AWOL for 5 months. She\u2019s a hot mess and that cat deserves a stable home. Might wanna get your cat a gps collar though in case she tries to kidnap (cat-nap) him.", "NTA\n\nCharge her $25/day for 5 months which is the low end of what pet boarding charges. That\u2019s $3,750 plus the vet fees. It\u2019s inexcusable and irresponsible that she never got him neutered or microchipped etc.\n\nI\u2019m no lawyer but if property is abandoned for over 90 days you\u2019re pretty much out of luck. Plus, the chip and vet bills are all in OP\u2019s name \n\nYou know she ghosted OP because she felt guilty for dumping the cat indefinitely and was too lazy for excuses", "NTA. You\u2019re a very nice person for not dropping that cat off in her parents backyard or a shelter. She pushed a responsibility onto you and now feels okay to pick it back up as if it was a forgotten t shirt. You graciously looked after this animal you never intended to adopt.", "NTA", "NTA.   \nShe left her cat behind without warning, and didn't pick up the phone for *months* after a few initial calls.\n\nIt's not her cat. It's in a healthy, happy, and loving family, and has probably grown just as attached to you as you have to it. Moving the cat now, for no reason, would be scary for the poor thing.", "NTA \nMake a list of all the expenses and I mean everything.  Food, vet, litter, flea drops, and boarding costs of $20/night (a deal); then and only then would you allow her to have a discussion about it.\nTell all mutual friends she abandoned the cat, ghosted all your calls and owes you $5k.", "Sounds to me like she was going through a really hard time. What happened in her relationship? I\u2019m imagining she was depressed and that\u2019s why she wasn\u2019t answering.", "NTA Ted is urs 1st she just up and left w/o tell u leaving the cat behind and refusing to get in contact for a week. Then she only stayed in contact for a few weeks out of the 5 months before ghosting y\u2019all. There was no cause for that. It\u2019s not like she was a way at college or in the service. If she really loved Ted she would have been visiting, bringing over food, toys, and litter and calling or texting y\u2019all to check in on him at least every few days to make sure he was ok and didn\u2019t need anything. She didn\u2019t now it about doing what\u2019s best for Ted. Does he even notice that she\u2019s gone? Is he mopey? If not I wouldn\u2019t give him back he\u2019s settled in to his new home and family. It would be cruel to uproot him unnecessarily. My cat mopey when I\u2019m gone for more than 3 hrs but would get the zoomies when I returned. When I had surgery and had to stay in the hospital for 7 days she didn\u2019t even last 6 hours before my brother called me and complaining she wouldn\u2019t stop crying. I had to do either zoom, FaceTime, of speaker phone with her twice a day just to calm her down.", "NTA OP  \n\n\nAlso if she tries to do some bullshit like claim you stole the cat, you can present all the vet bills and the fact she refused communication with you for months and a court will definitely side with you.", "NTA ted is yours now. Enjoy! A true cat parent would never dump him on you like that and that's why he is yours now.", "If I'd left my cat with someone, for whatever reason, I'd be paying for his food, and asking for daily text updates (photos included), along with regular visits. 5 months with no contact is ridiculous.", "Then there's jerking Ted out of a happy home and into probably chaos. So NTA!!", "Adopting an abandoned cat is the opposite of nefarious.", "> OP did all that on her own for whatever reason. \n\nBuy food and supplies for the cat in her house??", "Its the same with microchips in Australia, its chipped in OP\u2019s name, its her cat.", "It\u2019s a bit hard to explain lol it usually means joking around but you can also say someone\u2019s taking the piss if they\u2019re messing around and not taking things seriously.", "\"Not being serious\" either in the sense of a prank or in the sense of being negligent or useless.\n\nIn the context of this post it's like \"Her actions/ expectations are so unreasonable and unrealistic that it's comical\"."]}
