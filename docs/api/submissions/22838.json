If so (like you had enough to eat, had decent clothes to wear, etc) then giving her absolutely no notice especially when he has to pay bail is not a fantastic move.

That is called welfare fraud and you should report the fiance to your state inspector general's office.  \n\nNTA, and as soon as you're established, try to get custody of your younger brother and get him away from that shit show", "~~op=NTA for leaving~~  OP=YTA, yes you had every right to move out(not ah for that) But you are AH for being a freeloader and acting as if your sister owed room/board to you after you aged out at 18.\n\nbut I do wonder if you are misunderstanding a few things.\n\nThe money that your sister received from the Government(state/whatever) to provide for your care(housing, food, etc), LIKE child support, is money to take care of a child, not the child's personal money to spend/have.\n\nSince you clearly are alive, she fed you, and tho you shared a room, she did house you. So far I don't see any mismanagement of funds.\n\nAs to since you turned 18, is she still getting funding for you?  My understanding is that sort of thing generally stops at 18.  IF she is getting funding for you, then yes, you should not have to pay rent.  However, if that money ended, then as an adult, putting a FAIR sum into the household is not an unreasonable ASK.\n\nAnd tho i don't know your sister's income she's caring for multiple children of her own along with you and your brother and a useless fianc\u00e9(so a household of a minimum of six, possibly more).  So I highly doubt HER income and the money she's getting from the government for your brother(and you?) is making her rich.  She's likely just getting by.  Now that the useless fianc\u00e9 has misappropriated all the Money, she's feeling desperate.\n\nI will say--if she's NOT getting any money for you since you turned 18, then yes, for the last year you have been an AH not to pay her any rent.  She took you in rather than force you into foster care with strangers.--you seem to not have one iota of gratitude for that.\n\nETA(googled): so social security benefits end at 18(someone suggested this might be an income stream your sister was receiving) \n\nAnd most Foster care payments end with 18 but definitely by 19(exception ie: an 18 yr old who hasn't graduated high school).  So it would seem that you have been living off your sister for at likely at least 12 months and don't think you owe her anything.", "NTA - her fianc\u00e9s bail is her problem not yours.", "NTA! But I do feel bad for your little brother poor baby.", "NTA", "NTA. Report your sister and her husband to your/your brother's case worker for theft of the child support checks. (If it is safe for your brother to do so)", "Esh. Shouldnt have lied and been up front. Also she took care of you.", "N T A for leaving, but I gotta be honest here, YTA for lying.  Your sister sounds like a real piece of work, and I'm not exactly upset that she fucked around and found out, but you shouldn't have agreed in the first place.  Regardless of the fact that you had a good reason (which you did), you still threw off her planned budget.", "I feel sorry for the kids and your little brother.", "No, you're not TAH her fianc\u00e9 is a major one for gambling away the monthly checks...  She's barking at the wrong person.  Good luck to you...", "NTA, but maybe try to help your little brother.", "NTA.", "NTA, certainly could have handled it without burning bridges, but you did yourself a solid getting out of there. Just thinking, though, how safe is little brother? And are you prepared to be his new foster parent if sisters' fianc\u00e9 comes back and becomes physically as well as financially abusive?", "NTA. The goodness you left. The environment in your sister\u2019s home is toxic.", "NTA - but you shouldn't get the money that the state gives her for your food and living expenses. You should ask the state to investigate her because she is giving the checks to her idiot to gamble away\n\n\nyou should also not pay for his bial.", "NTA. Lying is justified, if it gets you out of an abusive situation. And it was an abusive situation. Just because they never hit you, that doesn't mean that they weren't financially abusive towards you.\n\nI am glad that you are out of there, OP.", "Hmmm... she's been housing him and feeding him all these years. Where do you think that money comes from?\n\nI mean he's totally right to look out for himself and move out. But she also fulfilled her duties by housing him and feeding him.", "At the very least if she's still collecting money for you, you should let them know you are no longer living with her.", "They won't investigate and don't gaf. Going through this right now with my older daughters sister. She's keeping the 2 k she gets to pay my daughters rent and utilities. They basically said if we escalate it my daughter loses the insurance that's tied to the payment and they absolutely refuse to intervene.", "Remember the money she got isn't much.  Most foster parents have to pay most kid fees out of pocket.  The money they get barely covers food and clothes.  Plus how on earth would she account for the money.  If it went to rent and electric bills that is properly spent", "This. Sounds like everyone will be better off with fianc\u00e9 in jail. \n\nNTA", "Are you blind or just don't know how to read ?", "She literally gave all the money that she was given to take care of OP to a gambling criminal asshole and then made OP pay more for the things that money was supossed to already cover. Do you even know how to read ?", "The sister is also an enabling asshole, she is the one giving fiance the money", "You- \"She is your family OP ! so its okay if she steals your and yours brothers money to give it all to a criminal gambling asshole and you can't be mad at her !\"", "How !?", "Honestly, dating a loser who spends all their money at casinos and gets into a fight at one makes the sister sick way more.", "Oh no, he lied to their enabling thieving sister and her gambling criminal piece of sh*t fiancee, what a tragedy...", "> I think you should try to stay on good terms with her though. She is in control of whether or not him get to see his bro. And, if she marries that gambling man, she could go through periods where they have no money and food it really scarce.", "> She needs the money because fianc\u00e9 has a problem.", "Actually most states take welfare fraud very seriously. The problem is that they don't have the resources to do anything about it.  Source: I work for a state agency that handles welfare fraud cases.", "At the very least report your sister! Everyone knows you\u2019re the one doing the right thing! You\u2019re not the one locked up for gambling the states money meant for the children!", "Yeah- sad the younger brother is stuck there, but at least he\u2019s out and can start his life.", "OP won the money to move out playing Bingo = is also gambling....", "Her older sister was literally giving the money that was supossed to be used to take care of OP and their brother to a gambling criminal asshole, OP was literally ENTITLED and that \"attitude\" sounds like just common sense in this situation, and you clearly lack of it", "Move to f*king where ?!", "OP has to work, go to college and take care of a six year old?\n\nIF CPS would even give OP the right to care for Little brother.  Highly unlikely as OP wouldn't be seen as financially stable.", "I\u2019m taking that with a grain of salt, who was paying for the house the food the clothes every other household necessity? If it wasn\u2019t the sister it must have been no one. OP didn\u2019t personally get the money so claims it wasn\u2019t used on them, when clearly money must have been spent. \n\nThe sister took them in when she absolutely did not have to. I know no government in the world that would pay enough to compensate for taking care of 2 children. The sister chose to do this when I can absolutely say it would be in her personal best interest to leave them to the State to take care of. \n\nThe OP has also been working and living there for more then a year as an adult and not helping the household at all. \n\nLike I said OP is absolutely entitled to leave and absolutely not responsible to pay someone else\u2019s bail. However that does not stop them from being entitled and ungrateful for what the sister did for them for 4 years.\n\nPS. Also the OP was absolutely not entitled to that money, it is for there care not for them personally. I think it\u2019s you who lacks common sense, or are you saying the government should be giving money to children and just hope they spend it in the right way."]}
