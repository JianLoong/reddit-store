If so (like you had enough to eat, had decent clothes to wear, etc) then giving her absolutely no notice especially when he has to pay bail is not a fantastic move.

So far I don't see any mismanagement of funds.\n\nAs to since you turned 18, is she still getting funding for you?  My understanding is that sort of thing generally stops at 18.  IF she is getting funding for you, then yes, you should not have to pay rent.  However, if that money ended, then as an adult, putting a FAIR sum into the household is not an unreasonable ASK.\n\nAnd tho i don't know your sister's income she's caring for multiple children of her own along with you and your brother and a useless fianc\u00e9(so a household of a minimum of six, possibly more).  So I highly doubt HER income and the money she's getting from the government for your brother(and you?) is making her rich.  She's likely just getting by.  Now that the useless fianc\u00e9 has misappropriated all the Money, she's feeling desperate.\n\nI will say--if she's NOT getting any money for you since you turned 18, then yes, for the last year you have been an AH not to pay her any rent.  She took you in rather than force you into foster care with strangers.--you seem to not have one iota of gratitude for that.\n\nETA(googled): so social security benefits end at 18(someone suggested this might be an income stream your sister was receiving) \n\nAnd most Foster care payments end with 18 but definitely by 19(exception ie: an 18 yr old who hasn't graduated high school).

It might be your turn to be the foster placement soon. \n\nAlso you don\u2019t want to leave him with your sister whose likely unhinged with stress now. Maybe make sure the kids know how to reach you if they\u2019re in danger - it\u2019s not so much about your sister, she can care for herself.\n\nWishing you all the best!\n\nI wish you could be grateful to your sister, it was great she took you two in. BUT her misuse of that money and allowing a gambling addict to access the family\u2019s only means of survival - that\u2019s on her. Bad decisions all around.", "NTA", "Nta.  Your money.  Also toxic environment so gtfo is right choice.  Use your money for yourself they don't deserve your help", "Depending on State and situation since this was family involvement care my knowledge is that it came to about a little over 1k per child in a state in the NE region of the US and that also included Child Support.. they also recieved food stamps, state insurance, and other government benefits  such as free internet for the whole house (because the children loved there and needed it for school), and other programs. \nOp is NTA \nBut the sister and her boyfriend need a good investigation into.", "N T A for not burning yourself to keep others warm. However you never were supposed to receive the government money yourself.\n\nDid you and your brother have food, clothes and a relatively stable home situation without being separated? Then your sister did a good job. ( Just look up what foster homes can be like )\n\nYou are a bit of a dick for lying to your sister though, if she was budgeting and suddenly you tell her: oh yeah that 100$ isn't coming that is stressful.\n\nSo in this situation YTA", "NTA. Her fiance will just have to keep his backside in jail then won't he.", "The boyfriend obviously didn't take the money. Can't believe people are actually buying OPs story.", "To suggest the little brother is being neglected is ludicrous. The older sister did an extremely selfless things and decided to raise her 2 younger siblings. The youngest she has basically raised his entire life, OP doesn't describe anything that would could even remotely be considered \"neglect\". To suggest the younger brother would probably be better in a complete strangers house in foster care is one the dumbest things I have ever heard. The older sister did something not many people would do and now OP is clearly fabricating the details of this story to fit their narrative.", "Ludicrous suggestion. She has managed to raise her 2 younger siblings just fine. OP literally stated \"she isnt hurting her for money so I dont understand why shes badgering me to pay rent there\". OP is just lying about the later details in the story to justify them not paying rent for the last year and secretly moving out without so much as saying by and thank you to their sister for stepping up and taking them in the last 4 years of their life.", "Litteraly nothing OP has stated points to them being abused. I can't believe you would even make such a ludicrous assumption. The older sister did a extremely selfless things and stepped up to raise her 2 younger siblings when she didn't have to. Not to mention while already having kids of her own", "Didnt just leave her in a bad situation either.  OPs younger brother lives there too, and so do OP\u2019s sisters kids.    \n\n\nOP\u2019s sister now has to scramble to figure out how to make rent and provide food for at least 3 minors.   All while either blowing money to get fiance out so he can work to help, OR leaving him locked up to save money but also missing out on any potential income from him.   \n\n\n\nEven forgetting about OP\u2019s sisters kids and the fiance, OP just fucked over their own younger brother who as far as i can tell is 100% innocent in all of this.", "But she's not asking for stuff. She's asking why she's being made to pay bills when there's already government money being sent for that, and this couple isn't being responsible with their money?", "You forgot to add\n> Thank you for paying for me for the last year while you didn\u2019t get any foster care money to support me while I was working and able to save up to move out now by refusing to pay rent to you.\n\nI wish OP good luck on their own.", "This. I would definitely contact your case worker and explain the situation. NTA. Good job for getting out.", "It's not illegal. She provided housing and .took care of them. I'm sure OP is fabricating that part of the story to fit her narrative", "She didn't steal anything. The money is meant to be used to raise the kids. Which is exactly what the older sister used it for. Otherwise OP wouldn't have a had a.place to live and food to eat for the last 5 years of her life.", "Letting your siblings stay in your home is not the same as actually raising them. I have a friend who lived with her sister during her teen years and she was definitely neglected and then some. The simple fact that she took them in doesn't mark her as a great person", "Well I mean the whole fiance getting arrested for fighting at a casino. Whilst not the most scientific or even accurate generalization. But if someone is so invested in the casino the brother assumes he spends his sisters paycheck could either indicate a serious problem or a judgemental brother. I generally want to see the best in the OP which is why I ask for clarification. It is not exactly a fair generalization to make I am aware but it is often true. But again it is why I ask for clarification rather than making an outright judgement.", "They gambled her checks away and then asked her to pay back what they were missing in bills because they gambled the state money. The sister is asking to get paid twice, once by the state, and the second by asking for a kid to pay bills when there's already money for that being sent to them - which they wasted.\n\nAm I missing something? I'm not sure how this kid is an asshole for not wanting to double-pay a gambling addict and an enabler?", "There isn't money once they turn 18. OP is being asked for money because they're now an adult and have a job.", "Thank-you. All of these people clamouring to get the State involved...what outcome are you hoping for exactly?

So there for that money must be allocated to toward the housing and or food. Anything that doesn't fit to the house or food for the child must go to clothes/necessities.then  lastly wants of the child. It cannot be redistributed to other children in the home or people. There the check from the state can't legally be given to the gambling addicted husband. If the husband wants to take his wife money she earned f lmao.

What about moral obligation or family sticks together? Clearly (some) of the checks were spent on housing, food and clothing. Asking for bail money for a serial, violent, gambler to get bail? Sis is engaged to the wrong guy! Also just because she turned 18 has to pay rent for a \u2018section of a shared room\u2019 when OP can now afford an appartement with a friend for what I assume is less or equal asked rent?", "No she didn't", "There is nothing to investigate. OP is clearly fabricating the details this of this story and is being an entitled asshole. Her sister stepped up and chose to raise her 2 younger siblings when she didn't have to.

I can't believe people can't see what OP is trying to pull here.", "You're clueless if you actually believe OPs story.

They didn't gamble away the money they used to raise OP and the younger brother.", "Respectfully, OP is being asked to pay because the adults there are irresponsible with their money. Gambling? At 19 you really need to work on savings, getting an apartment, getting a car, and figuring out bills or education. \n\nThe little brother may still be under 18 (I don't think the post specified but I might be wrong) so that couple could still be getting checks for him. \n\nIf the money gambled away wasn't government funded, I think the adults in the situation are assholes for using their money irresponsibly and then supplementing with their 19-year-olds income, and OP is the asshole for moving out in the way they did. It'd be an ESH situation.\n\nAnd OP isn't necessarily complaining about bills or adult responsibility, because they're working towards independence and got an apartment. I wouldn't want to be tied into household finances with a serial gambler either.\n\nAs a person who is currently dating somebody with financially irresponsible parents - it is ROUGH shouldering bills as a teenager.

This comment is ludicrous.", "What makes you say that?", "It all depends.  Kids in foster care usually don\u2019t have much, either.", "There should be receipts- records. She had her household and 2 siblings.. so 4 people 1/2 of the bills - water, electric, etc were paid by the state .. next grocery- I'm sure food stamps were part and say another 200 each for each from the state money - the money left over is for clothing, school items, misc., and to be kept in an account that receives interest. So yes this is a crime .. one that the IRS would be extremely interested in especially with her sister and her bf - possibly other added crimes wire fraud (did he use the ATM card designated for the children use only and sisters use for the children at the casino especially) ..

OP is CLEARLY fabricating details of this story and it's ridiculous so many people are believing this story. The sister wasn't giving the checks to her fiancee.

Might be an INFO situation instead. \n\nI don't think OP is wrong for moving out, but they might be wrong for moving out and the way they did depending on the little brothers situation, and the finances involved. If these adults have multiple kids they can't care for or financially afford without a 19 year old supplementing their income, that's on them for sure.\n\nI certainly wouldn't ask a teenager to help me bail out a situation where the providing adults are irresponsible with money.

I think it's closer to ESH if the money wasted wasn't government funded.", "She is an adult, not a child.", "No she wasn't. She provided a roof over OPs head and put food in her mouth. Hate to break it to you but that costs money. A lot of money in fact, OP is clearly fabricating details fit her narrative. I can't believe people are actually believing the details of this story.

It comes from this post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1560mol/comment/jsxwnbp/\n\nIt also checks a large number of boxes on this list I've compiled over my months of bot hunting:\n\n- I'm extra suspicious of the comments in the 3rd position on a thread. Bots seem to love it there.\n\n- comment speaks directly to the OP but is a lower level comment that OP is unlikely to see (as opposed to the original, stolen comment which is top level and will send a notification to OP, so speaking directly to them makes sense)\n\n- comment doesn't logically follow what comes before (because it was plucked at random from further down)\n\n- comment unnecessarily starts with a judgment (because it stole from a top level comment where that was necessary)\n\n- username ends with random letters or a word that is missing the last few letters\n\n- post ends with ellipses for no reason\n\n- account is around a month old and never posted until today. (Update: This is changing.  There are some accounts only 5 days old and some a year old. But having no other comments is the dead giveaway.)\n\n- account made multiple comments in different subreddits/threads within seconds of each other\n\n- post looks like it used a thesaurus and doesn't quite make sense (because it's a rewording bot using a thesaurus! ). Pronouns are often switched and fancy words that don't quite seem to belong are used\n\n- post is nothing but quoted text\n\n- post begins or ends in the middle of a sentence (often ending with a comma instead of a period)\n\n- a bot NEVER has flair (because it never posts top level comments and certainly never has the top top comment) \n\n- The best and last step is to search within the current thread and find the original that was stolen from.  Unless it's a rewording bot or one of the weird ones that copies from a whole other thread or just posts affirmations (eg \"I agree!\" Or \"10/10\" ) you'll find it and know you're right.", "Yeah I just finished looking at all the accounts you called out and I\u2019m actually scared. In your opinion what\u2019s the ability of these bots? As in can they only copy other comments? Or have they been programmed to like think on their own and just comment stuff through AI?? \n\nEither way scary stuff, I once seen something saying over 66% off online social media accounts are bots but unsure on that number"]}
