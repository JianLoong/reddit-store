Im 19 and live with my older sister, my little brother, her fiance, and their kids.

Despite her receiving money from the government for me I never saw a penny of for years as well as still for our little brother, she isnt hurting her for money so I dont understand why shes badgering me to pay rent there. I share a room with him, hes six. I have a section to myself, and she wants me to pay hundreds for that in a tiny cramped house.\n\n\nI decided to save my money from my part time job (I do college online) and play bingo and have saved up enough for an apartment with a friend. Now I can finally have space to myself and pay rent justifiably. Just days before we were going to apply and pay the security deposit to secure the apartment, my sister informs me that her fiance got into a fight with someone at the casino and it turns out hes been gambling the monthly checks she gets away and thats why she needs me to start contributing to the bills since he got locked up and she needs to save for his bail and pick up extra shifts. I didnt want to tell her that I was planning to be moving out literally the following weekend so I lied and said okay but instead took my half and applied like I had been planning to for months. I made sure to pack my one suitcase while she was at work and left while the kids were at school. Didnt have much so it was fast. By the time I had signed the lease and picked up the keys is when I called and confessed to my sister I wasnt planning on returning ever except to see my little brother and she said that Im so fake for leaving when I promised her money for bills and she cant afford rent and her fiances bail and Im a huge asshole for lying to her because she doesnt know what shes gonna do and she starts crying.

Keep your distance, keep your money locked safe in a bank, say no every time she asks for money, and do not do any favors that do not directly benefit your brother.", "She gave the checks she received for you and your little brother to her fiance to gamble in the casino. That makes her the AH.", "NTA I feel that was more her fault than yours in that felt you had to lie. I don\u2019t blame you for moving out but I wouldn\u2019t have promised to pay the bail. \n\nShe should probably leave her bf in jail and just save the money. She let him take the money meant for you and your younger brother to gamble, that\u2019s just bad parenting and being selfish. You did what you needed to do.", "NTA. Her boyfriend isn't your responsibility. You are working towards goals to have a standard of living that you want and you deserve to be allowed that chance. She can use the checks from the government now that they aren't being gambled away. Maybe save these conversations for later in life if she tries to blame things on you to your brother.\n\nWish you the best of luck.", "NTA. She made her own bed with the fiance and her financial situation. It's not on you to save her. You might need to check on your little brother, though. If he's being neglected, he needs someone to look out for him, even if it's another foster family.", "NTA - You got to do whatever is necessary to get out of a toxic situation.", "NTA It was time to get out and away from them. They're blowing money gambling that should be applied for care.  You should consider reporting them since they're likely not going to have the money to support your younger sibling.", "You can't stay there. They will bleed you dry to manage her asshole boyfriend. Women need to stop paying for men like this. Leave him in jail. NTA.", "NTA, fly free.", "NTA Not responsible for bail, bills, or bad relationships.  Although, it's a burned bridge.  So there's that.", "NTA.\nProtect yourself first. You owe her nothing, her poor choice in men is not any kind of reason to not live your life. Enjoy your freedom.", "NTA I don\u2019t believe you would\u2019ve acted the way you did unless you had to. You sound like you\u2019ve got a good head on your shoulders, keep saving money and don\u2019t fall for a loser like your sister. Best of luck to you.", "NTA, this is her problem. Report her\u2014your brother deserves better.", "NTA -- her rent is here problem.", "Info: So whilst you may not have seen the money coming in from the govt to help pay for you kids. Alot of that cash go towards food and other neccessary supplies and costs (like one thing people forget is the guardians time gets compensated in certain scenarios). Which I assume you have access to? Because if not then you are entirely correct to hide your money and get out when the getting was good. If so (like you had enough to eat, had decent clothes to wear, etc) then giving her absolutely no notice especially when he has to pay bail is not a fantastic move. Considering the fiance has a gambling addiction I would say it would lean towards the former and he was most likely gambing your govt subsidies away and were most likely abusive (Mentally because it was not mentioned they were physically abusive which I figure you would have mentioned). Like either way your sisters fiance is an asshole and by extension so is she. But if she took care of you when you had no where else to go and was actually caring then completely freezing her out is a bit of a selfish move. But again that is only if they are not abusive/stealing from you and etc which all signs point to they were.", "NTA. You are an asshole, but not for the reason you are asking for. You are an asshole because you are unappreciative of your sister stepping up and taking care of you for the last 3 years. Why should you receive the money that your sister is paid to help cover your expenses? She paid for you housing, food, etc. You are an adult. If she wants you to pay rent, pay rent or move out. It's entirely fair to ask you to pay rent.\n\nThat being said, your money is yours and you should move out. Once you are on your own and paying for everything yourself, you will likely come to appreciate what your sister did for you.\n\nAlso, stop gambling; it is stupid. You will ALWAYS lose out in the long run gambling.", "YTA\n\nRegarding the government money\u2026\u201d You never saw a penny of for years\u201d??? It went to the roof over your head, the clothes on your back, and the food you ate. \n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to help get her fiance out of jail, but your sister took you AND your little brother as her responsibility. That government money wasn\u2019t yours to spend\u2026it was hers to support and care for you, which she did.", "I'm going to give you a soft YTA, but only because a little truthfulness might have avoided what's going to be a very trying time, at least in the short term, for a bunch of people, among them kids... for whom this is all out of their control.\n\nYou are absolutely entitled and correct in packing up and moving on... this whole situation is not fair to you, and it'll weigh you down until you're clear of it. Good for you for organizing yourself and getting on with your life. It's what you've earned and deserve. All of the best of luck to you.\n\nBut... what's going to happen to your little brother? Nothing good in the short term.\n\nNext time, hopefully there isn't one... think a bit ahead as to how your actions are going to affect others that you care about. You could've done everything you ultimately did, but simply have told your sister -- forget it, you're on your own. Deal with your criminal fiancee yourself; not my problem. And with a bit of lead time, maybe she could've arranged something.", "You're both the AH, her for expecting you to pick up after her crappy decisions and you for being chicken and not telling her you're moving out. Still good you moved out though.", "YTA - Why shouldn't you have paid rent? You're an adult now and part of the family. You shoukd have contributed something. You should have worked something out with her. Also, you should have just been honest.", "I would love to say N T A but you're still leaving your brother in there... Good for you for getting out, but call somewhere, arrange him another foster home (not you if you can't obvs), please don't just leave him. She won't let you see him probably.", "ESH ,honestly imo you more then her", "YTA! \n\nYou could have told the truth, but chickened out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I didnt tell her the truth because if she knew I was moving out I thought she would try to stop me somehow. Or get her fiance too. She kept asking me to pay rent there for literally nothing and if she knew I was saving money I know she would have blown her shit. I just had to keep everything under wraps.", "Yeah, but paying hundreds for a fraction of a room while you could spend the same amount for a space of your own in a non-toxic environment, where the money that should provide you is not gambled away, is just not logical. And honesty isn't necessarily the answer if you don't know if the other person reacts violent or abusive.", "She got rent\u2026from the Government\u2026which she gave to her fianc\u00e9, who gambled it away.", "Yeah but I feel like OP might have been more forthcoming if her sister hadn\u2019t been treating her poorly and demanding money from her. OP probably knew that her sister wouldn\u2019t take her moving out well, and would just make things more difficult for her. It *was* cowardly, yes, but OP likely knew at that point that she had to prioritise her own needs and make things as easy for herself as possible. NTA.", "Some people really do have nothing. And if he's like that then it makes one wonder how the rest of the relationship is and how trapped the sister may be.", "The sister still paid for her housing, food, etc. Whether she used the checks she got from the states for that or her own income, she still paid for those things.\n\nWhen my daughter and I moved to the states from Indonesia, we both just brought 1 suitcase and our carryons. I don't think it's abnormal for her to only be bringing a suitcase.", "I don't think her sister is being an asshole though. Her sister stepped up and took responsibility for her siblings.", "Mate you were living in the house as an adult, presumably she stopped getting assistance for you at age 18. Which means you were literally mooching there for more then 12 months contributing nothing to the household. \n\nIt\u2019s fine for you to move out but Christ you have an entitled attitude.", "Then OP should have moved out earlier. Do they eat? That costs money. Do they use the heat/lights/water? That costs money. Again, OP is an adult. Find a new place, don't feel like you're entitled to take up space for free. I agree the boyfriend's bail isn't their responsibility, but she absolutely should pay some kind of rent.", "And OP is still an adult who also need to pay her own way.", "She allowed her fianc\u00e9 to blow all the money that she was getting to take care of OP  and his brother. And then wanted OP to replace that money by paying rent to share a room with a 6 year old.  She didn't step up so much as use her siblings for income.", "Yeah, sounds like sister is in a bad relationship and doesn't know what to do except keep a roof over the little kids head, little kid of course can't do anything (and OP could have said bye to the kid tbh instead of walking out on him) and OP is in a shit situation caught in the middle. It's like ESH (except the kid) and NAH (except the boyfriend) at the same time", "I agree that the sister is in a bad relationship, but I don't think that inherently makes her an asshole. I think it's laudable that she stepped up and took custody of her siblings and should be given some leeway due to that."]}
