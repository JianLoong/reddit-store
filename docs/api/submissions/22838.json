If so (like you had enough to eat, had decent clothes to wear, etc) then giving her absolutely no notice especially when he has to pay bail is not a fantastic move. Considering the fiance has a gambling addiction I would say it would lean towards the former and he was most likely gambing your govt subsidies away and were most likely abusive (Mentally because it was not mentioned they were physically abusive which I figure you would have mentioned). Like either way your sisters fiance is an asshole and by extension so is she.
