If so (like you had enough to eat, had decent clothes to wear, etc) then giving her absolutely no notice especially when he has to pay bail is not a fantastic move.

So far I don't see any mismanagement of funds.\n\nAs to since you turned 18, is she still getting funding for you?  My understanding is that sort of thing generally stops at 18.  IF she is getting funding for you, then yes, you should not have to pay rent.  However, if that money ended, then as an adult, putting a FAIR sum into the household is not an unreasonable ASK.\n\nAnd tho i don't know your sister's income she's caring for multiple children of her own along with you and your brother and a useless fianc\u00e9(so a household of a minimum of six, possibly more).  So I highly doubt HER income and the money she's getting from the government for your brother(and you?) is making her rich.  She's likely just getting by.  Now that the useless fianc\u00e9 has misappropriated all the Money, she's feeling desperate.\n\nI will say--if she's NOT getting any money for you since you turned 18, then yes, for the last year you have been an AH not to pay her any rent.  She took you in rather than force you into foster care with strangers.--you seem to not have one iota of gratitude for that.\n\nETA(googled): so social security benefits end at 18(someone suggested this might be an income stream your sister was receiving) \n\nAnd most Foster care payments end with 18 but definitely by 19(exception ie: an 18 yr old who hasn't graduated high school).

I was left with no money for myself, I was left with no money for anything other than whatever he wanted. And I had somehow convinced myself that this was okay. I had somehow convinced myself that this is what I had wanted, to be with somebody who loved me. I didn't want to seem shallow by not wanting to be with somebody who didn't have a job.

It took two years for me to realize what was going on, and to snap out of it. It then took me another 6 months to get out of that situation, and if my mother and my grandfather hadn't been there with a place for me to fall back on, I would have ended up homeless. I would have ended up completely screwed. Because I had no money to save up for a place, I had nowhere to go. Yes there are women shelters, but those can only do so much for you. And I was too afraid to tell anybody about just how bad it had gotten. I didn't want to admit that I had been in a abusive relationship in any sense. I didn't want to admit that to anyone else or to myself. It's taken me 3 years to recognize it as financial abuse.
