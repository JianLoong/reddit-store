Despite that, though, my hands are still full and I would expect to be paid for a job.  It also meant that I was getting NO time to run errands, do any self-care, and get things done while the kids are at school.  My house became disorganized and dirty, I have gotten nothing done for Christmas, had to stop going to the gym, etc.  My only free time is when they' re at school and that was part of the deal of me being a SAHM.  I am fine with that, but when I do return to work, I expect to have time to do things for myself, equal division of household labor, etc.  This didn't happen all month because bless DH, he didn't see it as a job when I did it.  He may if I pushed the issue, but we were both under enough stress and arguing constantly anyway.  \n\nNow I am free again when the kids are at school but I am feeling so so so guilty that DH is doing it now.\n\nHe has the power to change it, though.

Unfortunately the elderly are like children.  Don't see them as older.  See them as younger.  Incapable of taking care of themselves, and not knowing what is best but having reaaaaally strong ideas about things. You have to put your foot down as the only sensible adult in the room.  Of course they will fear what this means, both from health and a money perspective (some people will never believe they have enough money).\n\nCaregiver fatigue is real.

In fact, he may be at the point where he needs to have round-the-clock care in a nursing facility. I know that is difficult for him to admit to himself; he may be in denial. But the toll that his health is putting on the rest of the family is damaging. In our family's case, people got divorced over this because one spouse was spending all their free time being a caretaker. Your FIL probably does not want to be a burden on your family, but he doesn't recognize that the situation has come to this, mostly because the deterioration of his health has been slow, over the course of many years. You all need to sit down with him and make a long-term health-care plan that works for everyone involved. This is a life-or-death situation that needs to be dealt with immediately.", "NTA. OP, you feel manipulated and taken advantage of because your *ARE* manipulated and taken advantage of. Your husband needs to get his ass in gear, bite the bullet, all the other cliches, and do what has to be done for his father to be safe and taken care of. The POA doesn\u2019t (imho) mean doodley as long as the FIL has not been declared mentally incompetent and can revoke it. It seems rather common that an elderly person would rather rot in their dirty Depends than spend their money on a home health aide. They always think & hope that their kin will sacrifice their lives and \u201ctake care of them.\u201d  They will, as you have learned, lie lie lie.
