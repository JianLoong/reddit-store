Despite that, though, my hands are still full and I would expect to be paid for a job.  It also meant that I was getting NO time to run errands, do any self-care, and get things done while the kids are at school.  My house became disorganized and dirty, I have gotten nothing done for Christmas, had to stop going to the gym, etc.  My only free time is when they' re at school and that was part of the deal of me being a SAHM.  I am fine with that, but when I do return to work, I expect to have time to do things for myself, equal division of household labor, etc.  This didn't happen all month because bless DH, he didn't see it as a job when I did it.  He may if I pushed the issue, but we were both under enough stress and arguing constantly anyway.  \n\nNow I am free again when the kids are at school but I am feeling so so so guilty that DH is doing it now.\n\nHe has the power to change it, though.  He has had Power of Attorney for years and has done nothing to address this.  Ugh.  So many mixed feelings.", "NTA at all.\n\nDH is the one that needs to get off his backside and care for or arrange it for his father.\n\nTrying to emotionally manipulate you is completely wrong.", "NTA.  They are taking advantage of you, and making you feel guilty for your trouble.  Showing you pictures? Yikes!  You don't need to see those. That does you no good.\n\nThey need a caretaker.   Unfortunately the elderly are like children.  Don't see them as older.  See them as younger.  Incapable of taking care of themselves, and not knowing what is best but having reaaaaally strong ideas about things. You have to put your foot down as the only sensible adult in the room.  Of course they will fear what this means, both from health and a money perspective (some people will never believe they have enough money).\n\nCaregiver fatigue is real.  Let someone who is trained to handle it handle it.  And let someone that is trained to lift him up lift him up.", "FWIW, yesterday morning I made an appointment with a therapist to help me stop feeling so guilty all the time.  I need help feeling comfortable with boundaries.", "NTA, you\u2019ve done everything you can to help but it is now affecting your own family life. It\u2019s down to the GF in my eyes.", "NTA if he truly needed help they would have paid for it or taken you up on your first offer to do this at your home for them to send pictures of the fall was manipulation tactic", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy don't you letYOUR HUSBAND find some solution for HIS DAD? Or not, just as he choses.", "NTA. Having gone through a similar situation, I know your FIL needs professional, in-home help. In fact, he may be at the point where he needs to have round-the-clock care in a nursing facility. I know that is difficult for him to admit to himself; he may be in denial. But the toll that his health is putting on the rest of the family is damaging. In our family's case, people got divorced over this because one spouse was spending all their free time being a caretaker. Your FIL probably does not want to be a burden on your family, but he doesn't recognize that the situation has come to this, mostly because the deterioration of his health has been slow, over the course of many years. You all need to sit down with him and make a long-term health-care plan that works for everyone involved. This is a life-or-death situation that needs to be dealt with immediately.", "NTA. OP, you feel manipulated and taken advantage of because your *ARE* manipulated and taken advantage of. Your husband needs to get his ass in gear, bite the bullet, all the other cliches, and do what has to be done for his father to be safe and taken care of. The POA doesn\u2019t (imho) mean doodley as long as the FIL has not been declared mentally incompetent and can revoke it. It seems rather common that an elderly person would rather rot in their dirty Depends than spend their money on a home health aide. They always think & hope that their kin will sacrifice their lives and \u201ctake care of them.\u201d  They will, as you have learned, lie lie lie. At some point your husband may have to go to Court and get Adult Guardianship but I imagine the dad\u2019s girlfriend will fight and say she should have it. But if she got it. that would at least make her take more responsibility for making the hard decisions.", "NTA. If hubby can slow down at work and watch the kids. Then why can't he watch his dad?? Stand your ground it's on the three of them to find a fix. Take care of yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's always welcome.\n\nFIL was being extremely sulky and didn't want to talk to me.  I turned on my \"dealing with sulky tweens\" hat and didn't let it bother me!  I asked if he wanted to hang out while I wrap presents.  He refused and kept wandering around the house pouting.  I put on some music and wrapped happily while singing along.  DH finished the task, collected his father, told me that he was glad that I wasn't allowing the sulky behavior to bother me and left.  \n\nUgh.  \n\nI don't know what is going to happen next- but I appreciate this support.  I think that if I hadn't read these responses to my post things might have gone very differently when I saw that my father-in-law was upset with me. I probably would have groveled at his feet and begged him to forgive me for disappointing him. Then my husband would have been annoyed at me for kissing his father's butt. That's one of the things that we argued about during this time is that he felt like I was doting on his dad and letting him get away with too much.\n\nThey have someone who can care for him at least 3 days a week now.

When my grandfather with Parkinson's became wheelchair bound, everyone in the house was injured within a month trying to care for him. He would try to walk and fall.

Eventually we had to get care for him bc literally no one was able to due to all the injuries.

Once you\u2019ve put your foot down and refused to even step foot in your FIL\u2019s home again, I think you will be amazed at how quickly your FIL\u2019s girlfriend and your husband hire someone to take care of FIL.\n\nNTA", "Nta,  they need to see the problem and fix it , including DH , you need to stop helping.", "Give yourself some grace. You did what none of the others were willing to do. I am sorry to say but Yes, you were manipulated. I would take all those hours worked, multiply by 25.00 (at the least), and make it very clear that is what I expect to be paid. If your husband is having a hard time, then that's on him, he's known about this for years. Do not feel guilty, you did what you could when you could and now you can't."]}
