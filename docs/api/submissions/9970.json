I didn't mind this before, and sometimes it was cute, but a recent incident has made me rethink our approach to privacy.\n\nA few days ago, my girlfriend (26yo) recorded me (23yo) after I got out of the shower. She had forgotten to turn off the camera after dinner, and it captured my whole naked body. I was uncomfortable with this and asked her to delete the video. I told her that while I know she wouldn't intentionally share it or use it for revenge, I worried about the future.\n\nMy girlfriend didn't understand my concern and felt I was accusing her of something she wouldn't do. I tried to explain that I wasn't accusing her but that I just wanted to make sure our privacy was protected. In the end, she deleted the video, but now she's upset with me and won't talk to me.\n\nI don't know if I'm the asshole or if my girlfriend's reaction is justified. I understand that she may feel hurt that I don't trust her, but I don't think it's unreasonable to want to protect our privacy. I would like to hear what you think of this situation and whether I should have handled it differently. \n\nThank you.\n\nTl;dr\nMy girlfriend has a habit of recording our daily life with hidden camera which I usually don\u2019t mind. Yesterday she recorded me naked, I asked her to delete it for future consequences, she eventually did but won't talk to me now. Looking for opinions on the situation.\n\nEdit 1.\nThank you so much for so many detailed and nice replies!\n\nEdit 2.\nWe had a small conversation where I mentioned my concerns, I hope she will understand. She told me she will stop doing these hidden camera videos.\n\nEdit 3.\nBy saying hidden camera I mean her phone placed somewhere in the house when we are spending time together doing spontaneous things. She does it maybe 2 or 3 times in a year, never captured me naked before. Just us talking and laughing with each other.", "created_utc": 1676408581, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112g30b/aita_for_being_upset_on_my_girlfriend_after_she/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While I expressed my concerns about future consequences, I may have come across as accusatory and mistrusting, causing my girlfriend to feel hurt and defensive. It's possible that I should have approached the situation more gently and with greater consideration for my girlfriend's feelings.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I make sure she knows when and where cameras are setup, when they're taken down, I delete anything she has an issue with (very rare).  And when I'm taking pictures with portable devices (phone, DSLR, etc) I make sure she knows if she's in frame.  \n\nYour GF's behavior is entirely out of line, childish, and attempt to be manipulative and absolutely justifies your concern.", "NTA. This should have been a very simple thing. A mature person would say \u201cSorry, honest mistake.

Having a confrontation each time will be a big problem.   \n\nYou have 4 options that I see:\n* Stop her from making these hidden cam videos entirely\n* Fight with her every time you walk in your home without being fully clothed\n* Stop being concerned about getting recorded nude\n* Break up with her \n\nChoose 1, good luck", "So, let me get this right... you were 17 and she was 20 when you first started dating? And now she's recording you naked without your permission? And basically guilt tripping you if you ask her to delete it? Um... this whole relationship is super sus...", "NTA. This could've blown up horribly. Yes, she says she \"won't share it\" but what kind of guarantee do you have that she wouldn't do so at some point; what if you had a terrible break up? What if it got shared accidentally? What if someone surreptitiously got access to it and shared it?\n\nGlad she stop doing these hidden videos. It sounds really violating actually, I would hate being around someone who did such things. She's also opening herself up to potential lawsuits.", "Definitely NTA - If my SO had a compromising photo or video of me and I asked him to delete it, he would do it in a heartbeat.

I understand why you wouldn't be concerned with *her* age but as an adult she should have been concerned with *yours.*\n\nEither way it's really weird that she just sets up cameras around the house. I wouldn't be surprised if she has more videos of you like that that you don't know of. She sounds like a weirdo to me.\n\neta: nta I guess", "Neither of those, we are both from different countries and met each other in a class dedicated for immigrants. She was always with older guys and I was in a long relationship with an older girl before, I hate to say it but I feel I was different, I didn\u2019t enjoy parties and had plans for the future unlike other guys in my age. Maybe that was something she was looking for.\n\nI have edited post now, sorry for misundersranding but by hidden camera I meant her phone placed somewhwre in the house to record us talking and laughing with each other. She always showed me every video she recorded including this one and there are none spying cameras in our house.", "NTA but are you sure she isn't sharing these videos on social media?  I'd be highly suspicious of my partner if they did this.", "Doesn't she know people's phones get stolen all the time?  NTA", "NTA.  Obv.", "NTA- No one has a right to have media of another person's naked body if no consent is given.  This isn't about her, its about you.  You have every right to not want a video of you on her phone/devices/whatever.  The fact that she's making this into some kind of 'attack' on her is, pardon me, bullshit.  Not suggesting that this has to be the 'end all' to your relationship if you can work this out, but she is TA in this situation for pulling this 'feel sorry for me' move after you explained to her that you don't want something like that to exist on a device.", "NTA this is not okay at all. Your girlfriend needs to stop with the recording it's not cute when it's violating you. Her reaction is also manipulative.", "Everyone IS outraged tho...", "NTA", "NTA", "Make sure it's deleted from the trash, too.", "1000% NTA here. Consent is key and the gaslighting Is a red flag", "5 hours in for a reversed gender post I do believe it would have exploded.

If she'd forgotten to end the recording after dinner, sure, understandable. But why would the phone be in a position in the bathroom to catch OP naked? Bit weird if you ask me.", "I may be wrong, but I assume that it wasn't set up recording the bathroom, When I shower at my partners, the bedroom and bathroom are opposite ends of the house and after I shower I walk naked through the house to the bedroom, so in that situation a camera in the kitchen would record me naked.", "NTA, the video was of you and so the only person's opinion on it that matters is yours. My partner wouldn't ever have an issue if I asked him to delete something that private and wouldn't question it.", "NTA - it's a violation of privacy first of all, but if you don't have a problem with her recording candid moments then that's fair enough. I can see why she might feel like you don't trust her or something when you asked her to delete the recording, but I think if you put it in the context of if the video is stored pretty much anywhere, it can be hacked and distributed against both of your wills. I'm sure that's very unlikely (honestly don't know if it's even true, but it's something I always think!), but it's also so easy to lose a phone or leave it down somewhere and people can get their hands on it", "It was set up recording the bedroom, i was going to change my clothes after shower and got caught on camera, sorry for misunderstanding :)"]}
