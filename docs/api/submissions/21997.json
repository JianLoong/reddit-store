Every time he would bring home his paycheck from working all week after school, she would take it and spend it; never giving him any spending money to buy necessities.  The excuse was that he was contributing to help pay bills. This left my dad to fend for himself to buy food to take to work with him so he wouldn't go hungry because he wasn't allowed to take any food from home. He wasn't even allowed to ask for money to buy a single pair of pants. One day, my dad had had enough and didn't let his mother have his paycheck. He cashed it and bought a brand new pair of pants and shoes because the clothes he had were worn and ragged to the point of ripping. His mother knew when he got paid and asked for his paycheck. My dad told her that he had already cashed it and bought some clothes and shoes with it. She was livid and threw him out of the house.  My dad never went back home and lived with his grandmother until he was old enough to join the military. I don't understand why parents feel that they are entitled to take things that were given to their child. It seems like they are jealous  because they were left out. If family and friends are gracious enough to give your child money or anything else, don't be selfish and take it away from them; you don't know how that makes that child feel because you are wrapped up in your feelings. What my grandma did to my dad was cruel and selfish. She was the only one benefitting from it. My dad overcame his childhood and had a fruitful life; he worked hard to care of his family (he had 17 children total; I'm #11.) He remembered what he went through  with his mother and never deprived us of anything but instilled in us a good work ethic to be self sufficient. He was the most generous, fun loving, and sensitive, human being.  Years later, my dad had to take care of his mom till the day she died and although she treated him like shit and had a choice to do the same to her what she did to him, he never disrespected her but treated her kindly and used her SSI money to do things for her that he only wished she did when he was a kid.  OP is old enough to make his own decision to do what he needs to do to make it. His mom should have planned her life better so she wouldn't have to take OP's money.
