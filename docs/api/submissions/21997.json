So recently, my relatives visited to celebrate both my graduation and my birthday. To cut to the point - usually, when they come visit, they give some money to me and my siblings. However, inevitably the money goes to my mom. Every time we've been given birthday money or Eidi (money to celebrate Eid, a Muslim holiday), my mother pockets the money. This has caused some resentment, but we never really questioned it besides expressing general frustration.\n\nRecently, my family visited again to celebrate my graduation. One of my aunts gave me money - my mom saw, and so she took it. Another aunt gave me money and told me to buy a couple pants and shirts for myself, and not to tell my mom. So I didn't. I pocketed away the money for myself, and deposited half of it in my savings and half in my checking account. To be frank, the total of this money was around $500. This has been the only time I have ever taken the money my relatives have given to me for myself, rather than giving it to my mom. I figured since they gave it to me as a gift, I might as well use it for college, especially as I am low income, will be going no-contact with some of my family, and it will really help me out. The money in my savings account can now be used to cover my testosterone over the next two months. \n\nMy mom asked me if said aunt gave me money - I lied and said no. (I know it wasn't the best idea to lie, but my mother has a tendency of freaking out and I have already been kicked out due to being trans; in fact, this argument happened the day after I came home from being kicked out.)  She then called up said relative, who told her about the gift money. Long story short, she basically called me an asshole, said I should have told her about the money, that she usually uses the gift money to give our own cousins gift money, and that I would need to repay the $500 out of my next paycheck. \n\nI argued that before now, every single penny our relatives gave to my siblings and I had gone to her and that now that I am going to college, this money could really help me out. Plus, it was a gift given to me, which meant I had no obligation to give it to her. Heck, my cousin even told me not to. Despite this, she told me that I should've been more responsible and that I'm an AH for not giving the money to her. She then shifted the conversation into how she uses the money to pay the bills and how it would really help with car insurance (which I would perhaps be more empathetic about, if she didn't already take the money that my other cousin had given to me).\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689129450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xbhra/aita_18m_for_pocketing_the_money_my_relatives/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I doubt she actually used it to give cousins money. You're 18. You owe her nothing. If she tries to take you to court, she won't have a case. The money was never meant to go to her. If it was, it would have been given to her. She sounds toxic. Get out of there before you get kicked out again.", "NTA. Gifts for you are yours, not hers. Full stop.", "NTA\n\nIt was given to you so it's *your* money. Even if your family was struggling financially, she still has no right to pocket what is yours without asking. This is your first time keeping the cash for yourself and it isn't as if you'll be spending it carelessly. You're gonna be using it for college expenses. Your mom needs to suck it up.", "NTA\n\nYour mother legally has no right whatsoever to be taking money that is given to you. It is theft.", "NTA. Your mom is using you.", "NTA- it is your YOUR money not hers. From now on, never let her take it again. You are not obligated to pay her at all. Especially when she gives it to other people and pay her bills. She is delusional for saying you need to repay the $500 out your check. Repay WHO? It\u2019s your money. So how do you owe anyone? She is the one that owes you all the money she has stolen from you. If she needs money, she needs to ask.", "NTA if you\u2019re relatives wanted to give the money to your mom they would have", "NTA. This is so wrong, please keep the money.", "NTA.   \nI understand that this could be a cultural thing but I've noticed that it stops after a certain age. You're going off to college and will be supporting yourself which means there could possibly be unexpected expenses + your hormones. It doesn't seem like you'd be spending your money mindlessly so definitely NTA. I sympathize with your mother on other aspects such as the bills and insurance, but other than you also have your life to live.", "NTA. Honestly, these relatives wouldn\u2019t have given money via you to pay her bills. Or if they truly intended to- would have given her the money directly. \n\nThis money was for you, and you alone. Graduations are worth celebrating as a major milestone.", "NTA! Asian parents tend to take their children's money because that's what their parents did etc. \"I gave birth to you so you have to give me your gift money, your salary or else you are selfish and not grateful!\" BS. But the new generation cannot continue this trend and we need to stand up for ourselves... I'm indian and my mom used to take my money too, but it was only because I was still young. She also spent it on things for me too. By the time I turned 14, she trusted me to spend my money wisely. Especially now that you are 18 (aka an adult), you have the right to keep your money. Don't give in! She is trying to take advantage of you. You are doing a good thing by planning to go no contact. This environment is not safe for you (even more so bc u are trans and ur mom seems transphobic) and you deserve better!\u2665\ufe0f Use the money to save up for your future. And pls don't feel bad for your mom bc she needs to pay bills etc. She is an adult and can handle her own finances. You don't need to support her with her finances, especial if she is toxic does not support you with your struggles. \n\nINFO if you don't mind sharing, do you have ppl who support you? (Asians tend to be very discriminatory towards the lgbtqia+ community bc 'traditions'). And did you come out as trans b4 or after the gathering?\n\n\nPs, your Aunt shouldn't have told your mom she had given you money.

NTA.\n\nI usually try my best to respect cultures, even if it makes no sense, but I hear CONSTANTLY about Muslim children being expected to give their money to their parents, even once they are adults and it is NOT ok. You were given that money, not her. I lived next door to a family form the Middle East and some of the customs were just so intense, especially on the girls. Basically 9/10 kids no longer have contact with the parents because they drove them away by holding onto antiquated traditions that no longer fit into the modern age. My own family (on my dads side) had some customs that I've heard of that I am SO glad didnt stick through the generations.", "As far as I see it, your mom seems to be playing some game in which she just regifts money intended for her kids, back to family unit it came from. This basically negates the purposes of the gifts. It might be different had you known what she had been doing, but you did not. Now that you know, this all depends on your family unit\u2019s financial standing, if you guys are in good shape, keep the money, but if this is only way your unit has been able to keep up with Jones\u2019s then give it back. Anyway you go, you\u2019re NTA-that was a gift for you, and at 18, I\u2019d say it\u2019s high time you get (and give) your own gifts", "NTA Tell her the money has been spent and you will not be paying a penny to her.", "You are not the AH at all.

She can\u2019t make it to the washroom in time?

But every time I got birthday money or babysitting money, she would take it the minute I walked in the house. I have children of my own now and that's one thing I made sure never to do.

Your mom's been taking your money for ages and you finally stood up for yourself. It's about time! She can't expect you to keep handing over your hard-earned cash. You're low income, going no-contact with some family, and need all the help you can get. Besides, it was a gift for you, not her. She needs to respect your boundaries. Keep that money for yourself!", "You know what it'll be different if she was taking the money and saving it for you for like a moment like this if you were going to college and now you have money to go with you. Or you knew that at one point growing up that your family was going through a hard time and she had to use the money unfortunately or you wouldn't have food on your plate or she actually bought you clothes and toys with the money from your aunties and uncles but she didn't so you are NTA. She is the biggest a hole here not you and the never hurts to ask you for that $500 dude I wish my aunties and uncles would give me $500 for my birthday or holiday do you know how much money I would have if each of my relatives did that. And how much can your family be struggling if your aunties and uncles are doing that well and giving you that much money I mean really again if my kids aunties and uncles were giving my kids that much I would have left over for them. If I owe you I will start saying something and I understand especially in your culture that you respect your elders however it's just a shameful to take someone else's money and make them suffer you should have a nice amount saved up for you if your mother been taking your money and she shouldn't be using your money that your aunties and uncles have been giving you to buy their children gifts so that means their own parents bought them their own gifts. If she's going to try to shame you you should try to shame her back that is that parenting if she tries to bring you shame isn't she bringing shame to the family? Those are things that you have to start thinking of and honestly you are not a female if you want to technically think about it. A male is supposed to show responsibility especially at this age with the money so they shouldn't be giving it to your mother they should be giving it directly to you or your mother should be giving it directly to you and telling you say thank you Auntie and Uncle I will be using it for this and then you will show your Auntie and Uncle what you got and how successful you be coming with the Investments that they have been giving you for all these years.", "NTA. I'm sorry your being hated on for being trans, that's a hard mental health issue to figure out. Best of luck.", "Absolutely not the AH, sue ur mom dude", "Your mother is using guilt to steal from you, her child. It's a crappy way to do family. NTA", "Thank you for your kind words! I have heard many of my desi friends joke about their parents doing this too, so there definitely is a cultural aspect to it. It's also worth noting that the only person who was ever allowed to actually keep their money was my brother  (ironically enough when we questioned this, she mentioned it was because he was going off to college - looking back, it's more likely because he was a guy, whereas I am AFAB).\n\nThankfully, I have a group of friends who support me for who I am. When I was kicked out last week, a close friend housed me for a while. Him and his parents were very kind about it and said I could stay for as long as I needed (although I felt guilty, so after speaking to a lawyer, I decided to come home and wait for a formal eviction notice from my mother). I do not feel as though I have a family, but I am very thankful to have such supportive friends.\n\nEdited to add: I came out as trans a couple months ago, although only to my mother and siblings. My mother outed me to several relatives yet refuses to tell me who. I assume she didn't out me to the aunts that were at the gathering because she asked me to hide my pride flag and t prescription when they came over.", "I don't respect it because 99% of the time when someone says Oh it's a cultural thing, it's just a backwards thing, it's a refusal to grow and evolve because you enjoy being barbaric and don't want to upset the status quo when it doesn't benefit you. Cultural is just another term for barbaric and backwards.", "Unfortunately, it's not really a game. Many Asians think of money going to each others children is like an exchange. \"I have 2 kid she has 3 now I have to lose money haiyah\" \ud83d\ude33", "There is a high chance your aunt would have heard abt it bc relatives love to gossip. That may be why she told your mom about the money bc she doesn't 'support you' anymore.", "I'm sorry that your family is not supportive...I believe in the concept of found family and your friends are those people for you! People who love you will be glad to help you out so don't feel guilty abt asking for help. Just remember to get back on your feet bc it's always better and safer to be independent. And your brother probably did get to keep the money because he was a biological boy. I remember the time my mom was pissed that her brother commented that it's ok if I didn't do well academically bc I could be married off\ud83d\ude12"]}
