So recently, my relatives visited to celebrate both my graduation and my birthday. To cut to the point - usually, when they come visit, they give some money to me and my siblings. However, inevitably the money goes to my mom. Every time we've been given birthday money or Eidi (money to celebrate Eid, a Muslim holiday), my mother pockets the money. This has caused some resentment, but we never really questioned it besides expressing general frustration.\n\nRecently, my family visited again to celebrate my graduation. One of my aunts gave me money - my mom saw, and so she took it. Another aunt gave me money and told me to buy a couple pants and shirts for myself, and not to tell my mom. So I didn't. I pocketed away the money for myself, and deposited half of it in my savings and half in my checking account. To be frank, the total of this money was around $500. This has been the only time I have ever taken the money my relatives have given to me for myself, rather than giving it to my mom. I figured since they gave it to me as a gift, I might as well use it for college, especially as I am low income, will be going no-contact with some of my family, and it will really help me out. The money in my savings account can now be used to cover my testosterone over the next two months. \n\nMy mom asked me if said aunt gave me money - I lied and said no. (I know it wasn't the best idea to lie, but my mother has a tendency of freaking out and I have already been kicked out due to being trans; in fact, this argument happened the day after I came home from being kicked out.)  She then called up said relative, who told her about the gift money. Long story short, she basically called me an asshole, said I should have told her about the money, that she usually uses the gift money to give our own cousins gift money, and that I would need to repay the $500 out of my next paycheck. \n\nI argued that before now, every single penny our relatives gave to my siblings and I had gone to her and that now that I am going to college, this money could really help me out. Plus, it was a gift given to me, which meant I had no obligation to give it to her. Heck, my cousin even told me not to. Despite this, she told me that I should've been more responsible and that I'm an AH for not giving the money to her. She then shifted the conversation into how she uses the money to pay the bills and how it would really help with car insurance (which I would perhaps be more empathetic about, if she didn't already take the money that my other cousin had given to me).\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689129450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xbhra/aita_18m_for_pocketing_the_money_my_relatives/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She also spent it on things for me too. By the time I turned 14, she trusted me to spend my money wisely. Especially now that you are 18 (aka an adult), you have the right to keep your money.

You were given that money, not her. I lived next door to a family form the Middle East and some of the customs were just so intense, especially on the girls. Basically 9/10 kids no longer have contact with the parents because they drove them away by holding onto antiquated traditions that no longer fit into the modern age. My own family (on my dads side) had some customs that I've heard of that I am SO glad didnt stick through the generations.", "As far as I see it, your mom seems to be playing some game in which she just regifts money intended for her kids, back to family unit it came from. This basically negates the purposes of the gifts. It might be different had you known what she had been doing, but you did not. Now that you know, this all depends on your family unit\u2019s financial standing, if you guys are in good shape, keep the money, but if this is only way your unit has been able to keep up with Jones\u2019s then give it back.

She is the biggest a hole here not you and the never hurts to ask you for that $500 dude I wish my aunties and uncles would give me $500 for my birthday or holiday do you know how much money I would have if each of my relatives did that. And how much can your family be struggling if your aunties and uncles are doing that well and giving you that much money I mean really again if my kids aunties and uncles were giving my kids that much I would have left over for them. If I owe you I will start saying something and I understand especially in your culture that you respect your elders however it's just a shameful to take someone else's money and make them suffer you should have a nice amount saved up for you if your mother been taking your money and she shouldn't be using your money that your aunties and uncles have been giving you to buy their children gifts so that means their own parents bought them their own gifts. If she's going to try to shame you you should try to shame her back that is that parenting if she tries to bring you shame isn't she bringing shame to the family? Those are things that you have to start thinking of and honestly you are not a female if you want to technically think about it. A male is supposed to show responsibility especially at this age with the money so they shouldn't be giving it to your mother they should be giving it directly to you or your mother should be giving it directly to you and telling you say thank you Auntie and Uncle I will be using it for this and then you will show your Auntie and Uncle what you got and how successful you be coming with the Investments that they have been giving you for all these years.", "NTA.

I have heard many of my desi friends joke about their parents doing this too, so there definitely is a cultural aspect to it.

Him and his parents were very kind about it and said I could stay for as long as I needed (although I felt guilty, so after speaking to a lawyer, I decided to come home and wait for a formal eviction notice from my mother). I do not feel as though I have a family, but I am very thankful to have such supportive friends.\n\nEdited to add: I came out as trans a couple months ago, although only to my mother and siblings.

I would never dream of taking my childrens' gift money without intending to let them use it!! It is a *huge* learning tool on how to make their own choices and manage their money.

Sometimes it was uneven given the financial status of someone, which would obviously piss us off as kids, but as a grown up I kinda get where my parents were coming from and why they kept the money. We did not grow up rich, so it wasn't like there was money to throw around but traditions had to be respected too.
