My 27 year old buddy has a 31 year old wife. She hates that she\u2019s older than everyone and tells anyone who asks that she\u2019s 27. Nobody cares or makes fun of her that she\u2019s older, she\u2019s the only one who\u2019s bothered by it.\n\nI don\u2019t know how the conversation came up but me and my girlfriend were talking, and she was talking about how good this girl looks for her age and that she looks like she\u2019s our age (27-28). I said that 31 isn\u2019t old and that she looks like she\u2019s 31, which is basically the same as us anyway. \n\nWell my girlfriend ended up mentioning to this girl that I said I thought she looked 31, and she confronted me about it. She told me that everyone says she looks younger and I\u2019m an asshole for saying that she looks older. I tried to tell her that I don\u2019t mean that as an insult at all and that 31 isn\u2019t old. It got awkward and the conversation kinda ended, but she was still upset about it.\n\nI asked my girlfriend why she told her that and she said that she didn\u2019t think it was something that I needed to hide from her. I didn\u2019t think this whole thing would be a big deal or matter but apparently it is a big deal??? AITA for what I said? \n\nTLDR; said a girl I know looked her age when everyone else says she looks younger, girlfriend told her and now she\u2019s mad at me, AITA?", "created_utc": 1697405253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178pk88/aita_for_saying_someone_looks_their_age/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's overly sensitive but that's something you already seem to recognise  hence why you asked your girlfriend why she would tell her what you said.

You really SHOULD talk to her about it more, and not accept this \"she didn't think it was something that I needed to hide\" excuse.

It doesn\u2019t fucking matter.", "After thinking about what you said about the ill will ( for some reason you saying that gave me some pause). The only thing I can wonder is what was the point in saying it in the first place.  It wasn\u2019t like his gf didn\u2019t know  (At least doesn\u2019t seem like it), so it kinda does feel like it was said with ill will even though I agree he\u2019s not wrong.", "Pot stirring...", "I mean, in fairness it does a number on your confidence when you grow up all your life in a society that makes it clear that youth and beauty are synonymous and also your primary measure of value/success in life.

I\u2019m 33 and I\u2019m happy to be in my 30s, grey hairs and postpartum body and all. Meanwhile I have an older sister who just turned 37 who\u2019s been joking she turns 29 every year since she was actually 29. It makes me so sad- she\u2019s a stunning woman, no matter her age!", "Sometimes it does come from people telling us that all the time. I think my face looks my age (32), but most people I meet in person assume I'm a decade younger just because I am tiny (4'11, 110lbs). I have this conversation with clients regularly because they see I have a Phd and regularly ask how I was able to finish so young. Then I say, no I'm 32, and I get the \"oh no, I never would have guessed.\" But if people see my face only (like on a zoom meeting) I never have this issue. \n\nTo be fair, I honestly can't tell the difference between a 27/28 year old and a 31 year old. The only way I look different, even when looking back at photos, is the lenght of my hair.", "I bet it's not so much the years per se, as it is which side of 30 she's on.  I feel like there's a lot of societal *stuff* about 30 as a milestone or a magic number at which you become old.  And so she wants a few more years of \"not being old\".", "Yeah, that's what gets me.  By the time you get to your late 20s/early 30s, the only major differences between you all is really specific things the older person might remember that the younger people don't. But at only 4 years difference, even that probably doesn't happen that often.\n\nHow old you look? Come on.  You all DO basically look the same, and the differences are usually just a part of a person's genetic make-up, and out of their control.  \n\nI have a group of friends where I'm 6 or 7 years older than most of them. (They're part of a larger friend group in which there are also a bunch of others my age; it's just the 6-7 years younger friends live closest to me, so we see each other more often.) That's where I start to see more memory differences -- like, how old you were when certain songs or movies came out, movies that were childhood memories for me, that the others were too young to see in theaters, that kind of thing.  \n\nBut we all look pretty much the same, still.  I've been going grey more slowly than friends my age, and more slowly than some of my younger friends who have dark hair.  I always had really oily skin (shaking my fist that I STILL get some pimples, post-menopause!), but guess what, it's made my skin look \"younger\" longer than some of my friends.  \n\nI do feel badly for people -- and it's most often women -- who get obsessed with ageing and looking youthful.  Mainly because they're bombarded with that message, all the time, from childhood; it surrounds us and is blared at us constantly.  It's the fortunate woman who can just opt out of all that crap and not care.  I do understand why women care, and I wish it was easier to let go of it.  But I recognize it's not, even if I'm someone who pretty much always ignored it.  Just because it was \"easy\" for me to do, doesn't mean everyone else should have had the same experiences.  There are definitely social expectations that I feel pressure for, too.", "Oh stop. You can talk about shit in a private conversation, especially if you're not being mean about it.", "Apparently not with blabbermouth.", "Lol that's true", "ESH\n\n>she was talking about how good this girl looks for her age and that she looks like she\u2019s our age (27-28).

This is a ridiculous discussion.  What was the point of saying you thought someone looked older than another person thought they looked like?  You\u2019re basically smacking down a compliment someone is giving someone else for literally no reason.\n\nBut why your girlfriend chose to disclose your mean-spirited comment to this person, I have no idea.  All it did was create unnecessary drama.", "NTA, I do think you're girlfriend was trying to start shit but next time just tell a girl she looks younger. From what I've noticed a lot of men like telling women that 30 is \"too old\" and has led to women in that age range being insecure even though 30 is still very young imo.

Does your girlfriend often start drama? Seems like she enjoys chaos.", "Your girlfriend seems a little suspicious about saying something that she didn't need too. You are NTA. \n\nSome women just panic when they turn 30. I panicked the day before my 30th.

They just become mean old ladies rather than mean girls.\n\nHer lack of loyalty is really concerning though", "I think what he said was really nice, actually! It\u2019s true that people in their 20s are often indistinguishable from people in their 30s. 31 is not old at all so this woman looks the same age as them. She also looks 31. Same same.", "I agree that move was definitely calculated. I'd keep an eye out for similar issues.", "Hell, I don't look much different at 40 than I did at 30.  My grey streak is more noticeable, but my face is pretty much the same.\n\nSkin's currently in great shape.  This is lucky genetics (skin, nails, hair, teeth - everything else is a genetic clusterfuck lol), aside from sun precautions, I'm lazy and don't even feel a need to moisturize.\n\nIt's actually kind of nice to hit *this* end of the whole youthful appearance thing.  I was treated like a little girl into my early adulthood because to many people I just legitimately looked like a middle schooler.  *So* many accusations of \"obviously\" lying about my age, and the fact I had an unusual ID (military dependent, which newer retail workers could be unfamiliar with) did not help.  Someone tried to refuse me a video game purchase at 19 without even looking at my ID because \"Nice try.  You're *maybe* 15.  At most.\"\n\nIt took my father who was in line behind me with his own purchases (including the same game, lol) presenting his own military ID card matching the sponsor number on mine for me to be believed, lol.  Even then she was unapologetic, just kept going on about how *very* young I looked.", "[deleted]", "I'm 27 but I've still gotten a lot of this as well over the years, including the weird military ID and while I never had much rudeness it was still annoying to have others make such a big deal about it when they found out my real age. It's only been in the past couple of years that people stopped asking if I had the day off school when I run errands on a weekday.\n\nThings haven't changed much otherwise but it is nice to no longer feel like I HAVE to wear makeup to not be mistaken for a 14 year old like I used to.", "What? LOL, nah, but go ahead and project man."]}
