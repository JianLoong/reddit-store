Massive overreaction that would have me reevaluating the relationship.", "NTA \n\nIt's really unhealthy to hold your pee, especially to the point where you're in pain. He's acting like a child. If he wants to live with someone, he has to get over his. He might not \"like it\" but you can't help it, it's a bodily function. Please tell him you won't hold it again, it's much harder (and riskier) for women to hold it, we have smaller bladders and more pressure from other organs.", "NTA. Are you planning on this to be a long term thing? In the event you accidentally fart in his presence, what do you think is gonna happen? Date men, not boys.", "I think you might have interrupted your boyfriend masturbating.", "NTA\u2026.. it happens all the time to myself and my husband and half the time one of us gets in the shower at the other. You boyfriend needs to get a f**king grip.", "NTA. You had a natural bodily function, you didn\u2019t choose to have to piss. He needs to get over having someone piss while he showers. Me and my girlfriend both have been in your shoes hundreds of times and it\u2019s never led to a fight.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s in the shower. Why can\u2019t he just stick his head under the water so he doesn\u2019t  have to hear you pee?", "NTA what did he want you to do, pee in the kitchen sink? If he doesn\u2019t like hearing people pee then he should have finished up and gotten out of the bathroom after the first 5 minute warning that you had to go!", "I guess golden showers are out of the question with him?", "NTA lol what is his problem? Did he not want you to see him shaving his ass for his uncle or something?", "NTA. Whether you like the sound of pee, this is a small concession to someone you love. Seems to me (51m) to be a pretty serious indication of immaturity and selfishness.", "Is this question for real? Are you seriously expecting someone to go \"You're TA! How dare you enter the toilet when you desperately needed to pee, had given fair warning, and were in pain on the floor for 5 minutes??

A few things we know is you make sure no one has to use the bathroom before you shower, you take quick showers and if an emergency pops up, someone will come in to pee while you're showering.\n\nHe needs to get over his hangups and realize he's in a shared space with limited resources.", "NTA\n\ntell your boyfriend to man up.

It\u2019s not like you are having a dump next to him. When you need to pee , you need to pee immediately.", "NTA, he needs to get over himself.

I understand not being comfortable with people peeing while you are there- I myself only shower when I am 100% sure that nobody is going to bother or disturb me during it- but women tend to have it MUCH harder holding in a pee than guys.

Not a big deal.", "NTA. if yall live together he\u2019s going to have to get used to the idea that you might need to pee when he\u2019s in the bathroom. it\u2019s unhealthy to hold your bladder that long, especially to the point of pain", "NTA - this, from both sides is exactly why i hate houses that don't have the toilet as a separate room. you don't deserve to be in pain, so bf is TA", "NTA\nSomething about his reaction just screams red flag to me....", "NTA- he\u2019s the one in the wrong here.

You have a limitation with one bathroom and peeing while spouse is in there shouldn\u2019t be an issue, especially when they are in the shower.", "NTA he's mad because you disturbed his self check time. Intense scrutiny of his balls etc. Often involves vigorously shaking his tool up and down. Tell him to grow up.", "NTA. I share an apartment with two other people. It\u2019s common practice to ask \u201chey do you need the bathroom?\u201d before jumping in the shower. Over the years there have absolutely been occasions where someone urgently needed to use the restroom while someone was showering. My roommates just let each other in and continue showering because they\u2019re a couple, but all of us have had to jump out and give up the bathroom at some point or another if a housemate is having an emergency.

Probably on the phone with his other girlfriend or boyfriend", "No, hes the AH, not you", "NTA. Flushing is uncool so you gotta leave the lid down for smells. Number 2 is uncool unless it is an emergency. The toilet is more private for me than the shower. \n\nSome people use the shower for privacy reasons to think and be alone.

Get a new boyfriend.

It\u2019s very common for couples to pee in the bathroom while someone else is in the shower or brushing teeth etc. boyfriend either needs to mature or you need a new one. His reaction is unacceptable.", "Is this the dude you want taking care of you if you're in a bad accident and have to be taken care of for a few months?", "How would he even hear it, with the shower running?", "I agree with this wholeheartedly", "How does he handle public restrooms??", "This.   \nLike no need to justify it, \u201ci was in pain on the floor\u201d.

It\u2019s extremely frustrating and I totally get why he would be upset about not being able to finish.", "Forreal. Like however long he was in there before and then an additional 10 minutes after the fact of her having to use the bathroom. Either that or he was being petty and wanted a reason to be mad", "My thoughts exactly", "Yeah, this is not the behavior of a normal guy getting his shower interrupted by his sexual partner. He\u2019s an AH and an idiot or he was doing something bizarre (and still an AH)", "My cat approves.", "Dunno why but the phrasing \"big ole dumps in front of m'lady\" had me crack up laughing", "10 min?

I used to sit in the bathroom with my grandma while she took a bath just to talk shit. I still do it sometimes. My sister and I do it. I do it with my friends too \ud83d\ude02 \n\nThe only exception is #2. I\u2019m not shitting with someone else in the room.", "This. When you live together and the place only has one bathroom, you better get comfy with your SO's toilet and bathroom needs, or learn to be very fast. It's just disrespectful to try to hog the only bathroom", "Nope, I disagree. I would never share a bathroom even with the people I love the most. I can't stand peeing near someone or having someone pee near me.\n\nNow OP's boyfriend is still an asshole because in that situation, his girlfriend not peeing herself gets priority over him being uncomfortable, but not wanting someone to use the bathroom while you are showering or using the toilets is totally normal.", "I disagree.\n\nMy husband and I have been together for over a decade, and we still don\u2019t do our toilet business in front of each other.  It\u2019s something neither of us is comfortable with or wants to have happen.  \n\nIn a healthy relationship, you respect each other\u2019s boundaries.  If bf doesn\u2019t want her peeing in front of him, then she should respect that\u2026 but he should also not hog the bathroom, so she *can* go pee.\n\nBf\u2019s clearly the AH here, but not because he has a clearly communicated boundary about her peeing in front of him.", "He's a bloke for christ sake. He's had to use a urinal before in front of strangers. What's the issue with your missus peeing while you're showering? Do you not fuck?
