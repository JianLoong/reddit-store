My husband, lets call him Dan, works from 7am to 3pm during the week, and I work overnights on weekends, so I'm usually the one who drives the kids to all their activities.\n\nYesterday, Dan had to get shots on his foot for his plantar fasciitis. The appointment was at 9am, so I knew he'd be done by 11am. I asked him if he would be able to pick up the kids from camp at 3pm, but he said no because he might not be able to walk after. I told him there's no walking involved, since the kids are usually waiting outside. He said it's my job to drive the kids and that he needs the rest.\n\nI know Dan, and I know that he would probably change his mind and pick them up later. So I decided to pick them up early, about 10 minutes early. Dan called me on my way home, screaming that I knew he wasn't feeling well and tired, and that I have wasted his time by letting him drive all the way there in rush hour traffic. He does this all the time so I got tired of it. AITAH for picking them up?\n\n\nI feel like I have to add this. \nWe've had this conversation our entire marriage. We're not kids anymore, so I've decided to stop playing that game. I've told him to  mean it when he says yes, no or even a maybe and stand by it, instead of waiting the last minute and changing his mind.\n\nThose suggesting divorce need to calm down. It is an annoying habit that I wholeheartedly want him to change, but it's not a reason to get a divorce.\n\n\nAnother edit: He did the same thing last week. I asked if he could grab milk on his way home from work, and as always, he immediately said no. I stopped everything  i was doing, changed from my lounge shorts into jeans, and was waiting for him to come home so I could go to the store. \n\nHe came through the door with a gallon of milk. He went to the store when he said he wouldn't.  I wasted my time to change when I could have continued washing my daughter's hair.

Why shouldn\u2019t she pick them up early if she wants to?\n\nThe AH vote is based not on her actions, but on the reason for her actions - she deliberately picked them up early knowing he would change his mind. I\u2019d argue that if he changes his mind it\u2019s on him to communicate though, not on her. He was presumably quite happy for her to waste time on the trip too, or he would have said something.\n\nEssentially he is putting all the responsibility for communication on her - he can tell her what to do, change his mind, not tell her, and then blame her for not communicating? It\u2019s absurd. And it isn\u2019t fair that she has to manage and communicate everything when he fails to do so.

And if she goes on time, she takes the chance that she runs into him and they end up fighting, or the chance that she is there after him and has gone there unnecessarily. If anyone should be going there unnecessarily and wasting their time, it is the person who is going rogue on what has been agreed upon. \n\nSo ultimately, the only other option is to go early and so I'd say going early was to protect herself. You could argue that the situation should be avoided altogether by talking it out and for everyone to be reasonable, but he has already forced that option out the window with his prior actions and OP is just doing what she needs to do to not waste her own efforts and her own time. \n\n>She did it intentionally to piss him off.\n\nYou're projecting, you have absolutely no knowledge of her intent so you're just being ignorant there. \n\nThere's no part of OP being an AH here unless you're ridiculous enough to expect her to continually pander to her husband's ridiculous actions and expectations.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "If she didn\u2019t pick them up and he decided to actually honor his words and not pick them up, we\u2019d be calling her negligent and irresponsible.

I agree with you completely on why he is an asshole.\n\nBut OP's intent was asshole behaviour too. The reason for her actions IS because she knew he would go and she intentionally grabbed the kids early to spite him/teach him a lesson. And because it's unclear what kind of conversations they've had about his behaviour in the past, we don't know if it's been a situation where they've talked about it and he has never listened, or if she's held back her feelings but has let her resentment seethe. That matters too because if they've never talked about it before, at least seriously, how would he know her feelings?

Sometimes the only way to get someone to change their behavior is to show them how it feels when the shoe is on the other foot. \n\nIf OP never tried to communicate this before I would say e-s-h, but being that he still does this after conversations, I think NTA. \n\nJust to add, this behavior sounds like a power play on the part of OP\u2019s husband. It\u2019s all about controlling her. The best way to counter it is not to play into his hands.  Take him at his word and stick to it. When he sees that his attempts at control no longer work, he will stop (or if this is a more major case, switch to a different abusive behavior).", "How did she do it to be rude? She took him at his word, when he said no she decided she was picking the kids up.

Just bc its a habit that he changes his mind last minute doesnt mean she can just decide not to pick the kids up when they decided itd be her for the day. then if he didnt change his mind he would be mad the kids never got picked up. \n\nby your logic OP wouldve been the AH no matter what they did.", "No, they agreed that she would pick up the kids so she picked up the kids.

But if he'd at least tell you before hand you could act accordingly, You night want 8 hour notice, but 30 minutes is better than nothing.

Because it sounds super annoying.\n\nNTA", "This sounds like undiagnosed Pathological Demand Avoidance, typically found in people with Autism. Sounds like it's time to talk to a professional.", "I'm more concerned about him screaming at you.", "There are a lot of comments that seem disingenuous and like a pile-on.  \n\nPlease understand that it DOES make sense from his point of view. You need to understand why it makes sense. Even he probably doesn't know why it makes sense. Maybe there's anxiety about the future. Maybe commitment issues. Maybe he feels things are unfair. It would be super helpful to unpack. \n\nI reckon what you are doing is great. Show him how it feels when there's a lack of communication. Hopefully there's an ah-ha moment soon.", "You\u2019re  playing mom with a 36 year old child. I would cut your losses but it seems like you have accepted this behavior", "It's about power and ambiguity. If he says no and does it he's helped out despite being \"unable\" to. And if he doesn't do it, he said no so why would you think he would? He can do whatever he wants with no consequence if he says no. Except he can't, because OP is finally calling him out on his crap.\n\nHonestly? If I asked my partner to help me out, they said no, tried to do it anyway, and then got angry at *me*? If my partner tried to blame me because I should have just *known* that no means yes? I'd call them manipulative, possibly emotionally abusive, to their face.", "Does she have to spell out every little thing to him like he's in kindergarten?  He's a grown ass man and she isn't his mommy.  If he wasn't sure he could call or text and ask her.  He could also have let her know he decided to go get the kids after all.  He did neither and that makes him an asshole.", "\n\nIf I\u2019m understanding correctly, she knew he would probably change his mind and because she is frustrated with him, she purposely picked them up 10 minutes early so that if he did go out there, which he did, it would be for no reason because she already got them. \n\nIf she knew he would change his mind and wanted to save herself the trip she would\u2019ve called him before heading there and he would\u2019ve confirmed he was going there. \n\nSo, unless I\u2019m reading this incorrectly, she did that on purpose to be vindictive because of the way he\u2019s been behaving? So, even though his behavior wasn\u2019t great, neither was hers and it honestly sounds like they have a lot of issues to work out.", "That sounds EXHAUSTING...", "So does he have oppositional defiant disorder or is he just a pissbaby?\n\nNTA", "> It\u2019s LYING\n\nI noticed how OP doesn't want to use that word, but yes, that is what he's doing.", "Whoa I think you just put one of my main struggles into words.", "It's very difficult to have good communication with someone who lies all the time.", "STOPPED WASHING A CHILDS HAIR was the bigger part but good for you laughing at that, when there was zero reason to.", "My guess is he wants to be the hero and get thanked and congratulated for doing absolutely mundane shit he should be doing anyway. He doesn't want to do anything without a parade being thrown after.", "He 100000% knows exactly what the hell he's doing", "I want to agree, but at the same time, I think 99.99% of ppl are worthy of love. Like what happens to adults who really do have to be \"parented\" to a degree. I am not saying you or anyone in particular should put up with it, but at the same time, I just cannot imagine any type of \"quirk\" not have some kind of match somewhere (barring antisocial/psychopathic traits).", "She said that's not in the mix...no divorce.", "(Im a Sped Teacher). This sounds like ADHD with ODD mixed in.  Just an FYI", "I fall into the other category, the category of people pleasers who instinctively say yes to everything and then sometimes I can\u2019t live up to it and let them down. I 100% see where this guy and maybe OPs husband come from because letting people down really sucks", "Makes sense, I\u2019m not always clear on the symptoms since I have ~both~", "I feel like it could be a combo of this and some convoluted response to time management anxiety?  Like he's terrified of saying yes to something, finding out later that he can't manage to do it, and having to call his partner to change plans (and disappoint her)?  By saying no, he can over-deliver *and* not have to worry about if he does/doesn't have the time for it\n\nWhat I can't figure out is why he keeps doing it after multiple conversations?  We can't know if it's malicious, but if it isn't, his brain is doing something pretty funky", "Just like the person that always says they are not hungry but will always eat off your plate.", "That also sounds a bit unhealthy, like he's making you take on all the mental load. Presumably he also lives in the same house - so he can totally look around and make the list himself!", "What do you mean about ODD? What they described sounds a lot like me (diagnosed ADHD).", "Seriously. Deliberately ensuring that your partner never knows what her time will be spent doing, whether she's coming or going, and making it seem like reading your mind is an expectation met with consequences if not adhered to.....some pretty sinister undertones here.  The fact that she knew what was going to happen before it did is honestly awful.", "It's called gaslighting..."]}
