The appointment was at 9am, so I knew he'd be done by 11am. I asked him if he would be able to pick up the kids from camp at 3pm, but he said no because he might not be able to walk after. I told him there's no walking involved, since the kids are usually waiting outside. He said it's my job to drive the kids and that he needs the rest.\n\nI know Dan, and I know that he would probably change his mind and pick them up later. So I decided to pick them up early, about 10 minutes early. Dan called me on my way home, screaming that I knew he wasn't feeling well and tired, and that I have wasted his time by letting him drive all the way there in rush hour traffic.

Because she knew he was likely to drive all that way to pick them up, she was an asshole the moment she decided to pick the kids up early to spite him.

Tired of him saying no then changing his mind?\n\nStill spiteful and that's why OP sucks. She did it intentionally to piss him off.
