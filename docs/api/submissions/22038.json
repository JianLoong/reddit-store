My husband, lets call him Dan, works from 7am to 3pm during the week, and I work overnights on weekends, so I'm usually the one who drives the kids to all their activities.\n\nYesterday, Dan had to get shots on his foot for his plantar fasciitis. The appointment was at 9am, so I knew he'd be done by 11am. I asked him if he would be able to pick up the kids from camp at 3pm, but he said no because he might not be able to walk after. I told him there's no walking involved, since the kids are usually waiting outside. He said it's my job to drive the kids and that he needs the rest.\n\nI know Dan, and I know that he would probably change his mind and pick them up later. So I decided to pick them up early, about 10 minutes early. Dan called me on my way home, screaming that I knew he wasn't feeling well and tired, and that I have wasted his time by letting him drive all the way there in rush hour traffic. He does this all the time so I got tired of it. AITAH for picking them up?\n\n\nI feel like I have to add this. \nWe've had this conversation our entire marriage. We're not kids anymore, so I've decided to stop playing that game. I've told him to  mean it when he says yes, no or even a maybe and stand by it, instead of waiting the last minute and changing his mind.\n\nThose suggesting divorce need to calm down. It is an annoying habit that I wholeheartedly want him to change, but it's not a reason to get a divorce.\n\n\nAnother edit: He did the same thing last week. I asked if he could grab milk on his way home from work, and as always, he immediately said no. I stopped everything  i was doing, changed from my lounge shorts into jeans, and was waiting for him to come home so I could go to the store. \n\nHe came through the door with a gallon of milk. He went to the store when he said he wouldn't.  I wasted my time to change when I could have continued washing my daughter's hair.

Why shouldn\u2019t she pick them up early if she wants to?\n\nThe AH vote is based not on her actions, but on the reason for her actions - she deliberately picked them up early knowing he would change his mind. I\u2019d argue that if he changes his mind it\u2019s on him to communicate though, not on her. He was presumably quite happy for her to waste time on the trip too, or he would have said something.\n\nEssentially he is putting all the responsibility for communication on her - he can tell her what to do, change his mind, not tell her, and then blame her for not communicating? It\u2019s absurd. And it isn\u2019t fair that she has to manage and communicate everything when he fails to do so. I can see why she is fed up.\n\nI\u2019m not normally one of the people who jumps to \u2018leave him\u2019, but in this case, I really don\u2019t see why people who are this mean and spiteful to each other should be together.\n\n(By the way, I\u2019m not saying she isn\u2019t an arsehole exactly.

And if she goes on time, she takes the chance that she runs into him and they end up fighting, or the chance that she is there after him and has gone there unnecessarily. If anyone should be going there unnecessarily and wasting their time, it is the person who is going rogue on what has been agreed upon. \n\nSo ultimately, the only other option is to go early and so I'd say going early was to protect herself. You could argue that the situation should be avoided altogether by talking it out and for everyone to be reasonable, but he has already forced that option out the window with his prior actions and OP is just doing what she needs to do to not waste her own efforts and her own time. \n\n>She did it intentionally to piss him off.\n\nYou're projecting, you have absolutely no knowledge of her intent so you're just being ignorant there. \n\nThere's no part of OP being an AH here unless you're ridiculous enough to expect her to continually pander to her husband's ridiculous actions and expectations.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "If she didn\u2019t pick them up and he decided to actually honor his words and not pick them up, we\u2019d be calling her negligent and irresponsible.

I agree with you completely on why he is an asshole.\n\nBut OP's intent was asshole behaviour too. The reason for her actions IS because she knew he would go and she intentionally grabbed the kids early to spite him/teach him a lesson. And because it's unclear what kind of conversations they've had about his behaviour in the past, we don't know if it's been a situation where they've talked about it and he has never listened, or if she's held back her feelings but has let her resentment seethe. That matters too because if they've never talked about it before, at least seriously, how would he know her feelings? And if they have talked about it, that matters too.\n\nHe's responsible for communication, but because she admits she knew what he would definitely do, she's responsible for letting him know instead of enacting petty revenge.
