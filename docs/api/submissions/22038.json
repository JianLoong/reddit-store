I know she couldn't have been 100% certain but sounds like she was 95% certain.", "They said in a comment that this is a pattern he has. He says no to something then does it anyway. OP is tired of it and even told him he needs to say what he means.  So they picked up the kids bc the husband said no. They need a counselor though.", "Wtf? Someone needs to learn what healthy communication looks like", "??? \n\nHow is saying what you mean a path to divorce?", "Yeah you are solidly not the A. Does your husband have fucking Optional defiant disorder because that\u2019s just some\nReally childish shit.  \n\nThe only thing is that you should\u2019ve done it sooner. No means no from\nNow on.  \u201cNo\u201d can change, but *he has to fucking say so*", "Even then\u2026. The most we can say is E S H but like I can\u2019t help but think. Would you do this to a friend? This just is the kind of basic courtesy that shouldn\u2019t have to be explained. And that\u2019s what makes me go against the grain here. Sure having a conversation *should* be the think to do here. But in my life experiences, chronically inconsiderate people rarely change from a conversation.  \n\n\nHe\u2019s expecting her to just\u2026.not go get her kids and assume he will change his mind without  ever saying so. Just expecting her to know based on his past ( consistent but inconsiderate) behavior. Like Wut?? How is he not the asshole here.  \n\nYou can get in a lot of trouble as a parent for not picking your kids up including extra charges. \n\nAt some point he needs to experience actual consequences for his absurdly bad communication in these situations.  That\u2019s 1000% on him. No one else.", "What an AH", "You aren\u2019t the asshole here Op I\u2019m actually soooo angry for you. \n\nYou need to edit your post to include that you have talked about this before.  People are just assuming you\u2019re taking revenge as a first time attempt to get him to stop this shit.\n\nAlso it sounds like the real issue isn\u2019t even just him having to be in control but him ALSO not communicating that he\u2019s changed it.  That\u2019s so fucked.", "So when he said no, did you say \u201cok I\u2019ll pick up the kids\u201d? Why does he say no to things then do them? What\u2019s wrong with him?", "INFO: When he says he won't do something, do you *say* \"OK, I will do it, then,\" or do you stay silent and wait for him to actually do the thing anyway?", "If you know this is a pattern and did this to prove some sort of point, then you should both recognize you have poor communication skills as a couple and need to work on it. Maybe try couples therapy to work through the issues you both have and how to work on better communication. ESH", "I also don't understand why he would say he isn't going to do something", "Yes, exactly. Technically, ESH. This is a perfect example of malicious compliance.", "Unrelated, but I'm jealous you actually have a dragonfly", "I'm so sorry, dear. Research some healthy marriage rules and comms and get some therapy, even if you have to go alone. You should end up less stressed, and your kids will benefit from a less stressed parent.\n\nGood luck!", "Ok, but all you had to do in this instance was text him and tell him \"fine, I'll pick up the kids\" and then go pick up the kids. From the sounds of it, you intentionally didn't say you would, knowing he would likely end up going, and went early to get him angry and, I assume, teach him a lesson.\n\nIt's your intent that matters here as well. You let hatred and resentment dictate your actions. It's fine if you're sick and tired of him doing this time and time again. But there are healthier ways to confront this instead of what you did. Go to therapy, go get a lawyer to start a divorce, sit him down and tell him enough is enough, shoot him a text.\n\nBut I would avoid using your kids in this fight between you and your husband. This incident may not have affected them, but if these feelings escalate, it could get messy for them.", "But you did leave ten minutes early to make damn sure that, when he did go pick them up, he'd be frustrated.", "So you decided to teach him a lesson and be passive aggressive.  I get it.  But ESH", "My dad is very similar. \n\nBabe just get divorced.", "What was the reason for asking in the first place? You said that you don\u2019t work during the week and he does, so what was different about this day? A day where he also had a medical procedure? \n\nAnd how did the conversation go and end exactly?", "According to Kaiser Permanente, increased pain is common for 24-72 hours after injection and is experienced by nearly a third of patients.\n\nhttps://thrive.kaiserpermanente.org/care-near-you/northern-california/santarosa/departments/foot-ankle-surgery/foot-and-ankle-surgery/plantar-fasciitis/\n\nOther medical sites say it can take 2-3 days to feel relief.\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound like an excuse to me.", "I find nothing wrong with this reasoning. Sometimes we can be petty lol", "E S H is everyone sucks here\n\nY T A is You're the AH\n\nNTA is  You are NOT the AH\n\nNAH is No AH here.", "Yeah. I thought not saying what you mean is the path to divorce.", "For me, I think it sounds like something that, yeah, does need to be explained. Because it's affecting their relationship, and will 100% affect the kids if it continues. It already is toeing the line with how OP used the kids as a way to get back at her husband.\n\nThat's why she's an asshole and that's why it 100% needs to be talked about, even if it FEELS obvious, it likely isn't. \n\nMaybe husband has been talked to and ignores her or refuses to change. That would showcase the relationship not working. But either way, he isn't the only asshole in this situation for me. She's a dick for the way she's choosing to \"finally handle this\". She's tired of this really big flaw of his so instead of choosing to separate or choosing therapy or anything, she goes the passive aggressive route, through the kids, that was always going to end badly. She did this, knowing it would piss him off and she had to have know this wasn't going to suddenly get him to change.\n\nHe needs to communicate, but clearly, so does she. They may be at a stage now where they'll need therapy or, if they have tried that already, need to figure out if their relationship is salvageable because it sounds like it's getting close to not being that, on OP's end.", "And if she just... went with the assumption, and he *didn't* pick them up, he would have yelled at her for not listening to his \"no\". Absolutely the fuck not. She's NTA", "I can see your point, it\u2019s fair. It\u2019s interesting. In theory she did nothing wrong, I mean in theory she shouldn\u2019t have to text him to say she\u2019s picking them up - he\u2019s already told her she has to do it and that he won\u2019t. Why shouldn\u2019t she pick them up early if she wants to?\n\nThe AH vote is based not on her actions, but on the reason for her actions - she deliberately picked them up early knowing he would change his mind. I\u2019d argue that if he changes his mind it\u2019s on him to communicate though, not on her. He was presumably quite happy for her to waste time on the trip too, or he would have said something.\n\nEssentially he is putting all the responsibility for communication on her - he can tell her what to do, change his mind, not tell her, and then blame her for not communicating? It\u2019s absurd. And it isn\u2019t fair that she has to manage and communicate everything when he fails to do so. I can see why she is fed up.\n\nI\u2019m not normally one of the people who jumps to \u2018leave him\u2019, but in this case, I really don\u2019t see why people who are this mean and spiteful to each other should be together.\n\n(By the way, I\u2019m not saying she isn\u2019t an arsehole exactly. Your points are fair. I just think that he is a much bigger arsehole).", "Some lessons need to be learned the hard way. If he's dismissing child pick up as \"her job\", then he needs to say what he means and mean what he says. OP was petty, he is the AH.", ">Why else would she go 10 minutes early?\n\nIt would be completely unreasonable for her not to go at all and create the opportunity that nobody is there for the kids. And if she goes on time, she takes the chance that she runs into him and they end up fighting, or the chance that she is there after him and has gone there unnecessarily. If anyone should be going there unnecessarily and wasting their time, it is the person who is going rogue on what has been agreed upon. \n\nSo ultimately, the only other option is to go early and so I'd say going early was to protect herself. You could argue that the situation should be avoided altogether by talking it out and for everyone to be reasonable, but he has already forced that option out the window with his prior actions and OP is just doing what she needs to do to not waste her own efforts and her own time. \n\n>She did it intentionally to piss him off.\n\nYou're projecting, you have absolutely no knowledge of her intent so you're just being ignorant there. \n\nThere's no part of OP being an AH here unless you're ridiculous enough to expect her to continually pander to her husband's ridiculous actions and expectations.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "If she didn\u2019t pick them up and he decided to actually honor his words and not pick them up, we\u2019d be calling her negligent and irresponsible. She\u2019s damned if she does and damned if she doesn\u2019t.\nThere\u2019s no happy option for OP.\nEach possible scenario is doomed to end in OP being the bad guy.\nI say nta, because even if you had a feeling he\u2019d pick them up, it\u2019s not 100% and he had a valid reason for saying no. So what if today was the day that he meant what he said?\n\nIts an annoying situation\n\nBecause we have this unfair expectation that OP should not take him at his word but also have an underlying expectation that OP does what was communicated.", "I cannot count the number of times we've had this conversation, he doesn't want to stop. So I've decided to accept his no as no from now on till he stops. This behavior of his is annoying AF, but I feel like it's not a reason to get a divorce.", "I only asked because the kids like it when their father surprises them. I am always driving them around, so when they see Daddy in the pickup line, they get excited.", "Thank you!", "No, I stand by my answer go read her other replies, she\u2019s brought it up 1 million times and he just doesn\u2019t fucking care. He sounds like he\u2019s an obstinate  asshole who doesn\u2019t want to agree to do anything.", "And I'm not saying he isn't an asshole, because he is. I agree with you completely on why he is an asshole.\n\nBut OP's intent was asshole behaviour too. The reason for her actions IS because she knew he would go and she intentionally grabbed the kids early to spite him/teach him a lesson. And because it's unclear what kind of conversations they've had about his behaviour in the past, we don't know if it's been a situation where they've talked about it and he has never listened, or if she's held back her feelings but has let her resentment seethe. That matters too because if they've never talked about it before, at least seriously, how would he know her feelings? And if they have talked about it, that matters too.\n\nHe's responsible for communication, but because she admits she knew what he would definitely do, she's responsible for letting him know instead of enacting petty revenge. And especially using the kids for her revenge. What else would she do with the kids to spite her husband for?\n\nThat's why she is ALSO an asshole. No question about whether he is, but she is as well. They're both equally assholes with the information we are given.", "I'd also like to point out that I had plantar fasciitis and bone spurs in both feet. It was bad enough that I was crying at the end of a long day on my feet all the time. I had to have surgery to correct mine, and I feel like he's milking it. The shot itself hurts, but you leave on your feet and they kinda feel like marshmallows after. Him picking up the kids in a car wouldn't have been a huge ask to begin with, unless the weight of his own burdens was getting to him. \n\nThey both however need to come together and talk through their issues. This is on both of them.", "I've had shots in my foot for plantar fasciitis.  Your foot feels a lot better.", "If he made plans to drive himself to this appointment, that argument is moot. It's no harder to drive kids than it is yourself. He doesn't even have to get out of the car.", "And she used this information against him (knowing he'd go anyway) just to spite him instead of talking to him like an adult. She's letting hate and resentment and rage build and this is going to affect the kids, sooner or later. ESH.", "That's fair, I totally get that. I get just accepting his no as no and doing what needs to be done. I know that I say what I mean and I am aware that I have no right to get angry if someone does exactly what I have said. Believe me, I'm frustrated with the \"no means yes\" games and the \"changing of the mind last second, especially without warning someone\".\n\nI just think this incident was you taking it out on him, as you said yourself that you intentionally went early to be there first. Don't adjust your schedule just to spite him; show up at the normal agreed time. That's approaching it differently than how you did here. \n\nThe information you have continued to share helps a bit but I do want to warn you, at least from the perspective of the story you have given, it's far from just annoying you; you might be building up resentment. Going early to pick up the kids so you get them first is something to note. If this is not true, fair, but that is the impression I am getting so just be careful in how you approach this issue, ESPECIALLY when it comes to the kids.", "Then why did you show up 10 minutes early?", "Why do you choose the day of the shot to ask him to surprise them? Those shots are painful. Plantar fasciitis is painful. It seems that it was a bad day to pick.", "And how did the conversation go exactly? After he said that he needed to rest, what did you say and how did you leave the conversation?", "I did read her other replies. Personally, there's something we're missing because I still think she's an asshole, even in her replies. It's just a whole lot of resentment building up and missing context that leads me to believe they're more incompatible than anything, but BOTH have handled this issue very wrong.\n\nBut it's fine, we shall agree to disagree!", "And hopefully your plantar fascia doesn\u2019t rupture..", "I mean you do you, but I don\u2019t think we need to treat people who are rude and inconsiderate kid gloves. It doesn\u2019t make you an asshole to not do it.   \n\nI think there\u2019s plenty of information and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much missing. Her husband is chronically defiant and needs things to go his way and she has always rolled over, because she probably didn\u2019t want to make waves in a relationship.   \n\nIf there\u2019s anyone OP has been an asshole to, its herself for tolerating it this long."]}
