I have multiple conditions that cause me issues with balance, sleep, pain & breathing. I\u2019ve lived with these conditions my whole life, however my life is very full. I love to travel & adventure and do just as much as other people, but I rely heavily on aids.\n\nOne of my close friends has started to have hypos (low blood sugar) within the past year, she\u2019s only had three, but she feels very unwell when they happen, she gets cold and very dizzy, she starts trembling and sweating etc\u2026 It\u2019s scary for her which I understand and sympathise with.\n\nDiabetes and other conditions have been ruled out. Doctors are fairly confident that the hypos have been caused by her drinking habits, doctors have advised her to cut back and she\u2019s lied to them saying she has. Last week she had another hypo as she told the doctors she\u2019d cut back on drinking they have given a medication to help.\n\nToday she wrote a Facebook post announcing she is fighting a disability and that she needs support from her friends & family to get through it. I ignored the post finding it a little over dramatic, but there was no need to comment so I didn\u2019t. Within an hour or so she messaged me asking why I didn\u2019t comment on her post, I told her that I didn\u2019t feel the need to as we\u2019d spoken privately about her doctors appointment and the medication. \n\nMy friend asked if she could come over as she was feeling low so I said sure. She came over with his husband, we were having a nice evening playing some cards and chatting when she bought up the hypos again, I was listening and being supportive when she said \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be disabled like you now\u201d I just lost my crap. I told her that she has no idea what it\u2019s like to be disabled because she doesn\u2019t have a real disability. It turned into a huge argument until eventually she left with her husband. \n\nAfter she left I started to feel bad about what I said, I know she\u2019s struggling with this, but to compare it to my disability felt really hurtful. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA - \u201cLow blood sugar, also called hypoglycaemia or a \"hypo\", is where the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood drops too low.\u201d\n\nEdit to fix autocorrect.\n\nETA 2 - There are a lot of comments that the disability my friend has is alcoholism, to be clear she doesn\u2019t believe she has any alcohol dependency or issues, when she refers to herself as disabled she is referencing the hypoglycaemia as a disability. Also she has had extensive testing and no other symptoms than 3 hypoglycaemic episodes in 12 months. The doctors are very confident that if she reduces drinking the episodes will stop, I know this because I\u2019ve been to the majority of her appointments with her.", "created_utc": 1691368943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15k5oe9/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_she_doesnt_have_a/", "score": 2998, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Idk what the other comments are trippin tbh, they would probably consider having a birthmark a disability.", "NTA. There are different levels of disability, visible and invisible of course.\n\nWhat was out of line for her to say was that now she was disabled \"like you\".

She\u2019s the one who insisted on starting comparisons and made light of your health concerns to endow validity on her own. \n\nBut the thing is her health issues *are* valid. Relative to her baseline, this is a scary new condition. It\u2019s probably on her mind 24/7 as she goes through the process of learning all she can about it, learning about the biology, and slowly learning and beginning to accept the ways her life style will have to change to adapt to it. Sure, this is extremely minor *relative to your experience*. But she isn\u2019t you, and your normal isn\u2019t her normal. She\u2019s more than allowed to grapple with this.

Even if you are not exhibiting other signs of substance use disorder, if something you are intentionally doing to your body causes singular incidents of low blood sugar, that is not a disability. I can word it many ways, but this is clear. You are NOT gatekeeping. You are saying that someone who has a minor inconvenience does not compare to you having an ACTUAL disability. I am a person with invisible (usually) disabilities. I get judged sometimes and that is ok. I would NEVER compare myself to someone in your situation. I could compare to difficulties waiting in lines or challenges with accessibility. I could comiserate if we were both on disability or medical pensions and experienced some challenges with that. I would never compare body to body though. That is callous and inappropriate. For someone who DOES NOT have a disability, who is doing it to themselves, and seems to only be coming to you to get the attention and validation only someone who truly does have a disability could provide, they are wayyyyyy out of line. While you should never lose your temper at someone like that, that is because you don't deserve the stress of letting yourself get that heightened. You are allowed to be upset and your feelings are absolutely valid. Now that you ruined her charade, I would expect you need to grovel and post on facebook to fix this in her eyes. I would not. I would simply go no contact. She does need help, but not for hypoglycemia. I am sorry someone was so rude and tried to use you like that. I am also sorry so many people jumped the gun on judgement and are seeing you as a gatekeeper.

The friend's troubles and the OP's disability are each their own animal, and pressuring the OP into some sort of solidarity of the disabled is cringeworthy at best, and pretty offensive.

It's like this is some new disease. It's not like there isn't a mountain range of research and information at your fingertips about it. It's not like it hasn't been a hot topic that is regularly discussed on TV/radio. Her doctor can't diagnosis her as an alcoholic (if she is one and you truly know thay she hasn't quit or cut back on drinking and you're not just making some ableist assumptions about her) if she is lying to them about her drinking. Again, that should be quite effing obvious thay a diagnosis by her doctorsbis literally impossible if they dont know she is drinking because she is lying. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f FTR. Doctors and patients aren't the ones to usually or rarely \"make\" the diagnosis. It's the friends and families of the addicted that figure out their addicted. Addicts always think they can quit anytime, and their not addicted. They need people who love to get real with them about their addiction and often requires an intervention to tell them they are an alcoholic. Btw, lying about drinking, mot being able to cut back or stop, and drinking to the poker that it is negatively affect on one's health/life is the very definition of alcoholism.\n \nDo you even like your friend? You sound very judgmental about her. You completely lack empathy. Saying it's like yours was insensitive. Tbf, she probably wasn't actually trying to compare or think what is happening to her is the same as everything you have going on, but it is still probably very scary for her. She clearly doesn't think it is caused by her drinking and that there is something else going on. Whether it is alcoholism or something else, her symptom of hypoglycemia is a life-threatening symptom. She could literally DIE from hypoglycemia. (BTW, not even people who diabetes call them hypos \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) This is very new for her, very scary, she BELIEVES that it's not her drinking and something, and whether or not it is, either way, she has something wrong. It probably IS a disability. A new diagnosis/illnes/symptoms that have such an affect on your life can and will consume your mind and thoughts. She needed some empathy. Her approach was poor, but she was  likely just trying to relate (poorly) on some level. \n\nAnd you know what, she may really have something NOT related to her drinking as women are quite often dismissed by doctors for their symptoms and illnesses. Told to lose weight. Told it's their fault in some way. Told it's all in their head. Women being incorrectly diagnosed or undiagnosed for decades because doctors don't take them seriously is a known and common issue. Took me 47 years to get a proper diagnosis for myself.

That kind of gatekeeping is divisive.", "A mild ESH. For you these hypos are trivial problems, because you have so much you went through.

Her comparing her hypos to your disability is not fair.", "I'm sure there are people whose hypoglycaemia is unpredictable or extremely severe so they might have a permanent glucose monitor or a service animal that will detect low blood sugar. This may have a significant impact on their life. Do they regard themselves as disabled or do they see it as purely a medical condition they have to manage? I suppose that is up to them but you can see the impact it will have for them.\n\nYour friend seems to be at the other end of the sliding scale, her attacks are infrequent and she gets lots of warning signs, so she can at least get in a safe space when attacks happen. She does have a disability which is that she fails to see the connection between these episodes and her own behaviour. Perhaps that is what you point out to her next time she claims to be disabled.

Sympathizing is one thing, saying things are the same is the same cookie cutter bullshit used to discriminate and deny disabilities.  \n\n\n2: She is ignoring the diagnostic process.  \n\n\n3: You were very reasonable in your response, and I truly sympathize with where you are coming from. Any form of disability comes with an emotional weight that is difficult to predict, and having others dismiss your problems hurts. To you, her words felt like a dismissal of everything you have gone through, and continue to go through daily. That sucks. That said, your words as stated here dismissed any possibility that she has a real problem. Just because she is ignoring the diagnostic process doesn't mean there isn't a real underlying problem that the doctors have missed or not considered. Our medical system has a history of those instances. And there are plenty of things that start off as small symptoms and are ignored until it suddenly becomes significantly problematic. (Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's for example.)", "Who are you to tell ANYONE if they\u2019re disabled or not. Talk about gatekeeping.", "A little bit. She was too for suggesting she knows how it feels for you being disabled how you are. I feel like it's a NAH more than anything. I don't think anything malicious or truly ignorant happened on either side, just some misunderstandings and awkwardness. Still very real impacts. But I don't think truly A H material. \n\nIt's understandable that you had an outburst. I'm certain I would have too in a similar situation. But try not to judge her too much for leaning into this maybe a bit too much. It's scary and confusing. Sometimes when that's going on people over compensate a bit with making it a bigger part of them than it is. Sometimes it's like seeking validation that you are actually sick. Sometimes it's like trying to be more in control. There are loads of reasons and it isn't always the case, can vary etc. But it's definitely something that can happen when people become ill. I've been there too. I find that sort of thing really yucky and unnecessary now. \"Cringe\" is probably the word for it. But there was a time where I needed it. And being cringe then is what helped me get to the more balanced stage I'm at now. \n\nAlso bare in mind that just like she doesn't know everything about your experience you won't know everything about hers even if she is very open with you about it. There's likely extra complications and feelings that you don't know about. \n\nIf this is helping her process things that's fine. We all process things in our own ways. And although this doesn't seem like a big deal to you as somebody who's already disabled it clearly is a big deal to her. She shouldn't be comparing herself to other disabled people though. Not because she isn't actually disabled (it's not fair to judge), but because all disabled people have different experiences and yours obviously aren't going to be the same as hers. And yeah frankly her's isn't as severe (although again I really hate to compare like that. Disability top trumps is just really sucky) so it's kinda dense to act like they are the same. But I'm sure that was her being a bit silly and trying to connect rather than being truly ignorant and rude. \n\n\n\nThis feels to me like one of those oof moments where people do a silly and then people get emotional and it all gets blown out of proportion. \n\nI'd maybe send her a message or whatever saying that you're sorry you dismissed her experiences and you were just emotional because it felt to you like she was doing the same. You know she's going through a really confusing thing and you do care about that. It just felt to you like she was suggesting your experiences are the same which they aren't and that got you heated up and defensive. \n\nSomething like that. Use your own words and feelings obviously. \n\nHopefully that will lead to an \"I'm sorry too\" situation where you both accept that things were emotional and you didn't mean to hurt each other. And with any luck you can both move on from this unpleasant experience. \n\n\nSo yeah I don't think you were much of an A H. Maybe a little bit from both of you.", "Im sorry for your life struggles.\n\nIn my opinion YTA\n\nMy reasoning is\n\nThe definition of disability- a physical or mental condition that limits a person's movements,\u00a0senses, or activities.\n\nIt affects her life and even if it is alcoholism \"Alcohol use disorder is an impairment, and if it substantially limits a major life activity (e.g., learning, concentrating, interacting with others, caring for oneself) it will constitute a disability.\" \n\nSo even if self-inflicted it is affecting her life, and she is clearly struggling.\n\nYou are not the disability police so you should back off. It is not a competition who has the worst disability or more valid disability. \n\nJust support your friend clearly struggling with alcoholism and blood sugar problems who is clearly scared.\n\nAgain, my opinion", "Light YTA.

You assume she would stop if she could because you likely would but completely neglect the medical likelihood that she has a personality disorder or other condition that makes her WANT to be disabled and willing to harm herself to keep this going. Sure, the vast majority of people would simply stop drinking, but that does not mean the only alternative is substance use disorder. \n\nFor someone claiming that all this information is at your fingertips, your description of those suffering from substance use disorder is astounding, outdated, incorrect, and ableist. If you keep calling them addicts while you are pretending to advocate for them, it just shows that you are biased and here to push a narrative. Family and friends surely notice the symptoms of a disorder first and deal with the effects of it, but interventions RARELY work. There was a whole show on it, and most relapsed or did not commit to a program. Most people with substance use disorder need to hit their rock bottom, and they have to want to get sober for them, not for anyone else or because other people guided them to it. Being supportive of them often leads to enabling, and hard boundaries are required for recovery. \n\nIf a doctor says you need to cut back on alcohol because it exacerbates your condition, and they know she is lying (because... come on. Doctors aren't idiots and the majority can pick up on social cues or basic math), that is not the same as them ignoring her condition and under diagnosing. While that is a very big issue in the USA, it is undermined when you use it on every case, even when it may not apply. Nothing in this post suggests that is what is going on. \n\nI get it. I work in medical and was minimized and finally diagnosed with multiple conditions. Our pain is minimized even when we ARE educated. However, that is not what this post is about. This person, even if they have substance use disorder, is choosing to team build, be toxic, use her disabled friend to further her manipulation, and more. Substance use disorder does not give you a (N T A) card for your behavior, even if it was a factor. This person is toxic at a minimum, and no one is obligated to keep ANYONE who acts like this in their life, even if they do have a condition.
