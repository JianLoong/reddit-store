Doctors are fairly confident that the hypos have been caused by her drinking habits, doctors have advised her to cut back and she\u2019s lied to them saying she has. Last week she had another hypo as she told the doctors she\u2019d cut back on drinking they have given a medication to help.\n\nToday she wrote a Facebook post announcing she is fighting a disability and that she needs support from her friends & family to get through it. I ignored the post finding it a little over dramatic, but there was no need to comment so I didn\u2019t. Within an hour or so she messaged me asking why I didn\u2019t comment on her post, I told her that I didn\u2019t feel the need to as we\u2019d spoken privately about her doctors appointment and the medication. \n\nMy friend asked if she could come over as she was feeling low so I said sure. She came over with his husband, we were having a nice evening playing some cards and chatting when she bought up the hypos again, I was listening and being supportive when she said \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be disabled like you now\u201d I just lost my crap. I told her that she has no idea what it\u2019s like to be disabled because she doesn\u2019t have a real disability. It turned into a huge argument until eventually she left with her husband. \n\nAfter she left I started to feel bad about what I said, I know she\u2019s struggling with this, but to compare it to my disability felt really hurtful. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA - \u201cLow blood sugar, also called hypoglycaemia or a \"hypo\", is where the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood drops too low.\u201d\n\nEdit to fix autocorrect.", "created_utc": 1691368943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15k5oe9/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_she_doesnt_have_a/", "score": 212, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Idk what the other comments are trippin tbh, they would probably consider having a birthmark a disability.", "NTA. There are different levels of disability, visible and invisible of course.\n\nWhat was out of line for her to say was that now she was disabled \"like you\". That's an asshole thing to say because it's an asshole move to compare disabilities period, but also just plain unfeeling to say it to a friend who has been living with disabilities for a long time.\n\nSnapping back wasn't great, but insensitivity like that isn't always met with a calm response.\n\nIf said friend is hiding their drinking from their doctor, despite that being a cause of her condition, it might be a good idea to take a step back from that friend.\n\nAlcoholism is no joke, but ignoring it or agreeing to ignore it is a form of enabling.

She\u2019s the one who insisted on starting comparisons and made light of your health concerns to endow validity on her own. \n\nBut the thing is her health issues *are* valid. Relative to her baseline, this is a scary new condition. It\u2019s probably on her mind 24/7 as she goes through the process of learning all she can about it, learning about the biology, and slowly learning and beginning to accept the ways her life style will have to change to adapt to it.

Even if you are not exhibiting other signs of substance use disorder, if something you are intentionally doing to your body causes singular incidents of low blood sugar, that is not a disability. I can word it many ways, but this is clear. You are NOT gatekeeping. You are saying that someone who has a minor inconvenience does not compare to you having an ACTUAL disability. I am a person with invisible (usually) disabilities. I get judged sometimes and that is ok. I would NEVER compare myself to someone in your situation. I could compare to difficulties waiting in lines or challenges with accessibility. I could comiserate if we were both on disability or medical pensions and experienced some challenges with that. I would never compare body to body though. That is callous and inappropriate. For someone who DOES NOT have a disability, who is doing it to themselves, and seems to only be coming to you to get the attention and validation only someone who truly does have a disability could provide, they are wayyyyyy out of line. While you should never lose your temper at someone like that, that is because you don't deserve the stress of letting yourself get that heightened. You are allowed to be upset and your feelings are absolutely valid. Now that you ruined her charade, I would expect you need to grovel and post on facebook to fix this in her eyes. I would not. I would simply go no contact. She does need help, but not for hypoglycemia. I am sorry someone was so rude and tried to use you like that. I am also sorry so many people jumped the gun on judgement and are seeing you as a gatekeeper. Honestly, nothing in your post suggests to me that you do not recognize fibromyalgia or PTSD or other invisible disabilities as disabilities.

Because I don\u2019t have two working eyes to make even a blurry picture for my brain to figure out what\u2019s going on. \n\nBut, with my glasses, I can fully function, albeit with severely limited peripheral vision and no ability to see contrast or enjoy 3D movies, and I sometimes run into door frames or step off sidewalks because my depth perception is impaired. So, I have a disability, but I am not disabled. There are things I cannot do.  For the most part, they don\u2019t affect me today. But if my \u201cgood\u201d eye were ever compromised, my entire life would change. \n\nBut I would NEVER tell a wheelchair user that I understand what they\u2019re feeling. Because I can take the stairs. And use a regular bathroom. And I have access to anywhere humans have public access. Me not being able to enjoy 3D movies is not the same as someone not being able to walk. \n\nI\u2019m not sure where I land here, but I\u2019m leaning ESH because unless OP is her friend\u2019s doctor, they can\u2019t know their understanding of their friend\u2019s medical history is actually right.", "I guess in my mind for something to be a disability it has to be limiting in some way. \n\nBut I get she\u2019s struggling with this and I feel bad for snapping at her and for what I said, I just found the comparison very hurtful.", "Are you adding onto what I\u2019m sayin? I\u2019m confused", "Wait sorry if I\u2019m slow but if it blocks insulin wouldn\u2019t that cause high blood sugar rather than low blood sugar? Since insulin breaks down sugar in the body? (I think \ud83d\ude2d)", "The initial post said driving.", "Words have multiple meanings, I\u2019d assume she knows what she was referring to in her own post", "Oof, sorry to hear that. I have a family member that's had Meinere's since being a teenager.", "That sucks :/ I hope they find a cure/treatment soon....", "Yes it is, but the woman doesn't see this. She is lying about it. She says her disability is low blood sugar. Which in her case isn't a disability. \nSo if she would post on Facebook that she has a mental disability aka she is an alcoholic, this would be a disability.", "Doesn't matter. She still ckewly has something very wrong. Something thay could KILL her. Something that is very scary for her. Most addicts don't recognize they are addicts. Doesn't make them any less addicts. Doesn't make alcoholics not alcoholics because they don't recognize it. They are still disabled. And the hypoglycemia is a symptom fo that", "Nobody cares wtf they think. A person being unable to walk is not the same as a person who refuses not to drink.", "Doctors are confident a lot... and wrong a lot. If drinking is causing hypoglycemia, it's a symptom of something larger happening.", "Drink8ng doesnt cause hypos\n...it causes pancreatic problems.", "Tell her to get another doctor for another opinion.\n\nI went 2 years undiagnosed with multiple doctors telling me i was making myself sick. They were wrong. Multiple hospitals, pcp, specialists - ALL wrong for 2 years.\n\nAnd if you think she has a drinking problem be a pal and bring it up or take a step back. Don't enable her behavior", "You are disabled.\n\nThe fact that you can function with adaptive technology does not make you less disabled.\n\nYour right to wear eyeglasses while at work or school or out shopping is protected by the ADA.\n\nOf course you don't know what a wheelchair user is feeling. Just as you don't know how an end stage renal disease  patient is feeling. Or how am amputee is feeling. Your experience is unique.", "Not sure why you would, disabilities do not have to be limiting.", "Yeah, I am fuzzy on the details myself but there is a connection.  That\u2019s why I went with the general \u201cimpacts\u201d because school was way too long ago for me to remember that level of detail.", "I\u2019m sorry to hear that they got it so young. I was about 30 when I first had an attack", "She can say she has a disability. She doesn't have to specify mental. Also, addiction isn't just a mental disorder. Low blood sugar is a symptom of her disability though that has yet to be diagnosed from the sounds of it.", "No, I get it. It\u2019s the difference between \u201chaving a disability\u201d and being \u201clegally disabled\u201d. I\u2019m not legally disabled. And I\u2019m okay with that because I can work with no accommodations other than needing time off for treatment, which all falls well under my organization\u2019s sick time policy. \n\nI have a disability. I\u2019m not legally disabled, and I\u2019m not disabled to a point where I need accommodations. Other than \u201cdon\u2019t sneak up on my left side\u201d, I don\u2019t require anything other than my glasses to have a \u201cnormal\u201d life. \n\nIf there were degrees of disabilities, mine would be in the low-end of the spectrum.

Am an old fart now. Never heard if called a disability.", "I thought it was the literal definition of a disability. Idk anymore! I\u2019m so confused on what\u2019s a disability and what isn\u2019t now.", "Since the doctor said she needs to reduce drinking, it seems that they know quite well the reason. Her insurance probably doesn't pay for mental health services.   \nOr most likely it wasn't identified as a disability and at that point she doesn't have one.   \nNowadays every hip person claims they have a disability and are neurodivergent.\n   \nMost people of course don't have anything at all as it's just a hip word.", "If you need your eyeglasses to function, you are \"legally disabled\". And denying you the right to use your eyeglasses would be a violation of your civil rights.\n\n The right to wear eyeglasses is an accommodation for your disability.", "A lot of people with disabilities work.\n\nA disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life. If someone can't speak, they are disabled.

I have been tested for it. I am Combined type ADHD, severe, per testing. It IS a disability. And when you learn you actually have something wrong with your brain and you're not just a fuck up. You start realizing how it literally affects every single part of your life. Every. Single. Thing. Every thought. Every feeling. Every action or in action. It's insane. It's life altering. You learn to stop hating and blaming yourself for things you had no control. Many women (and men) have yet to get an official diagnosis yet but know without a doubt that they are ND. Women are so frequently diagnosed incorrectly as anxiety, depression, BPD, PTSD, or bipolar when they are ND. And if you have other mental illnesses with ADHD. I had one doctor tell me that ADHD cannot be diagnosed in women with ADHD. She was wrong. It took me 47 years to get diagnosed. I also have cyclothymia and ptsd. It's not gop.to have ADHD. It's a fucking nightmare. It's not fun. It's not cute. It hurts. It causes so much pain in one's life. Who tf are you to decide what they have and what they don't????", "*sigh* I didn't say a person with a disability cannot work. Please see my second reply where I said a disability impacts a person's ability to complete activities of daily living. People with disabilities can most certainly work. I have two invisible disabilities and worked until I retired at 68 last year.", "I have a Master's degree in Rehabilitation Counseling. By definition a disability MUST limit a person's activities of daily living. It has nothing to do with whether or not the person qualifies for disability benefits. My apply was a response to you stating that a disability does not have to be limiting.", "Then why post the SSA's definition?"]}
