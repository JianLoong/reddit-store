I have multiple conditions that cause me issues with balance, sleep, pain & breathing. I\u2019ve lived with these conditions my whole life, however my life is very full. I love to travel & adventure and do just as much as other people, but I rely heavily on aids.\n\nOne of my close friends has started to have hypos (low blood sugar) within the past year, she\u2019s only had three, but she feels very unwell when they happen, she gets cold and very dizzy, she starts trembling and sweating etc\u2026 It\u2019s scary for her which I understand and sympathise with.\n\nDiabetes and other conditions have been ruled out. Doctors are fairly confident that the hypos have been caused by her drinking habits, doctors have advised her to cut back and she\u2019s lied to them saying she has. Last week she had another hypo as she told the doctors she\u2019d cut back on drinking they have given a medication to help.\n\nToday she wrote a Facebook post announcing she is fighting a disability and that she needs support from her friends & family to get through it. I ignored the post finding it a little over dramatic, but there was no need to comment so I didn\u2019t. Within an hour or so she messaged me asking why I didn\u2019t comment on her post, I told her that I didn\u2019t feel the need to as we\u2019d spoken privately about her doctors appointment and the medication. \n\nMy friend asked if she could come over as she was feeling low so I said sure. She came over with his husband, we were having a nice evening playing some cards and chatting when she bought up the hypos again, I was listening and being supportive when she said \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be disabled like you now\u201d I just lost my crap. I told her that she has no idea what it\u2019s like to be disabled because she doesn\u2019t have a real disability. It turned into a huge argument until eventually she left with her husband. \n\nAfter she left I started to feel bad about what I said, I know she\u2019s struggling with this, but to compare it to my disability felt really hurtful. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA - \u201cLow blood sugar, also called hypoglycaemia or a \"hypo\", is where the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood drops too low.\u201d\n\nEdit to fix autocorrect.\n\nETA 2 - There are a lot of comments that the disability my friend has is alcoholism, to be clear she doesn\u2019t believe she has any alcohol dependency or issues, when she refers to herself as disabled she is referencing the hypoglycaemia as a disability. Also she has had extensive testing and no other symptoms than 3 hypoglycaemic episodes in 12 months. The doctors are very confident that if she reduces drinking the episodes will stop, I know this because I\u2019ve been to the majority of her appointments with her.", "created_utc": 1691368943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15k5oe9/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_she_doesnt_have_a/", "score": 2033, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Idk what the other comments are trippin tbh, they would probably consider having a birthmark a disability.", "NTA. There are different levels of disability, visible and invisible of course.\n\nWhat was out of line for her to say was that now she was disabled \"like you\".

She\u2019s the one who insisted on starting comparisons and made light of your health concerns to endow validity on her own. \n\nBut the thing is her health issues *are* valid. Relative to her baseline, this is a scary new condition. It\u2019s probably on her mind 24/7 as she goes through the process of learning all she can about it, learning about the biology, and slowly learning and beginning to accept the ways her life style will have to change to adapt to it. Sure, this is extremely minor *relative to your experience*. But she isn\u2019t you, and your normal isn\u2019t her normal. She\u2019s more than allowed to grapple with this.

Even if you are not exhibiting other signs of substance use disorder, if something you are intentionally doing to your body causes singular incidents of low blood sugar, that is not a disability. I can word it many ways, but this is clear. You are NOT gatekeeping. You are saying that someone who has a minor inconvenience does not compare to you having an ACTUAL disability. I am a person with invisible (usually) disabilities. I get judged sometimes and that is ok. I would NEVER compare myself to someone in your situation. I could compare to difficulties waiting in lines or challenges with accessibility. I could comiserate if we were both on disability or medical pensions and experienced some challenges with that. I would never compare body to body though. That is callous and inappropriate. For someone who DOES NOT have a disability, who is doing it to themselves, and seems to only be coming to you to get the attention and validation only someone who truly does have a disability could provide, they are wayyyyyy out of line. While you should never lose your temper at someone like that, that is because you don't deserve the stress of letting yourself get that heightened. You are allowed to be upset and your feelings are absolutely valid. Now that you ruined her charade, I would expect you need to grovel and post on facebook to fix this in her eyes. I would not. I would simply go no contact. She does need help, but not for hypoglycemia. I am sorry someone was so rude and tried to use you like that. I am also sorry so many people jumped the gun on judgement and are seeing you as a gatekeeper.

The friend's troubles and the OP's disability are each their own animal, and pressuring the OP into some sort of solidarity of the disabled is cringeworthy at best, and pretty offensive.

It's like this is some new disease. It's not like there isn't a mountain range of research and information at your fingertips about it. It's not like it hasn't been a hot topic that is regularly discussed on TV/radio. Her doctor can't diagnosis her as an alcoholic (if she is one and you truly know thay she hasn't quit or cut back on drinking and you're not just making some ableist assumptions about her) if she is lying to them about her drinking. Again, that should be quite effing obvious thay a diagnosis by her doctorsbis literally impossible if they dont know she is drinking because she is lying. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f FTR. Doctors and patients aren't the ones to usually or rarely \"make\" the diagnosis. It's the friends and families of the addicted that figure out their addicted. Addicts always think they can quit anytime, and their not addicted. They need people who love to get real with them about their addiction and often requires an intervention to tell them they are an alcoholic. Btw, lying about drinking, mot being able to cut back or stop, and drinking to the poker that it is negatively affect on one's health/life is the very definition of alcoholism.\n \nDo you even like your friend? You sound very judgmental about her. You completely lack empathy. Saying it's like yours was insensitive. Tbf, she probably wasn't actually trying to compare or think what is happening to her is the same as everything you have going on, but it is still probably very scary for her. She clearly doesn't think it is caused by her drinking and that there is something else going on. Whether it is alcoholism or something else, her symptom of hypoglycemia is a life-threatening symptom. She could literally DIE from hypoglycemia. (BTW, not even people who diabetes call them hypos \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) This is very new for her, very scary, she BELIEVES that it's not her drinking and something, and whether or not it is, either way, she has something wrong. It probably IS a disability. A new diagnosis/illnes/symptoms that have such an affect on your life can and will consume your mind and thoughts. She needed some empathy. Her approach was poor, but she was  likely just trying to relate (poorly) on some level. \n\nAnd you know what, she may really have something NOT related to her drinking as women are quite often dismissed by doctors for their symptoms and illnesses. Told to lose weight. Told it's their fault in some way. Told it's all in their head. Women being incorrectly diagnosed or undiagnosed for decades because doctors don't take them seriously is a known and common issue. Took me 47 years to get a proper diagnosis for myself.

I even get convinced that I'm lying to myself that something is wrong. My boyfriend tells me that no, if I think something is wrong, then I need to go get it checked out. He pipes in during doctors' appointments, telling them that yes, something is wrong and explains it better than I ever could. That's who needs to go.

If she just cut back then her issues would most likely go away. \n\nLet\u2019s be clear that she\u2019s had 3 episodes in 12 months, that\u2019s very infrequent.

My point is that you don't sound like you are being very supportive. I don't know who you are in real life, so all I have to go by is what's in your post. In your post, you frankly sound very judgemental.\n\n Your comments have only reinforced that to the point where I am now firmly in the YTA camp.", "Yeah disability has different definitions depending on context, even within the same jurisdiction. Disability as a social label is different to the definition for social services, which is different to the definition for employment legislation, which is different to the definitions under accessibility regulations, which is different to the requirements for a parking badge etc etc.\n\nPlenty of people who technically count as disabled under one of these sets of criteria may not count under others, and may or may not use the label as a personal identifier. For instance someone with a condition which is fully managed with medication may not need any accessibility requirements and wouldn't qualify for a parking badge. But they would (under some jurisdictions at least) still be classified as disabled if their workplace tried to discriminate against them for their condition.
