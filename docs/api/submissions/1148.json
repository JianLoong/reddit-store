{"id": 1148, "submission_id": "ylwkj1", "title": "AITA for telling other students they should come to class if they're failing?", "selftext": "Okay so we have a group chat for students in our paralegal semester. A few students always ask for help constantly and don't know what's going on because they never show up to class. Alot of us have been having a hard time finishing our mock trial because more than half the class never shows up. This is frustrating to everyone who does show up because we can never complete our lessons properly without them. I get people have things going on in life that make it hard for them to come and miss a day or two. As with me I have alot going on like a family/children, I have lymphoma and still manage to come to class. Well one of the students who is always missing classes and asking whats going on asked the group chat if anything was due for a particular class. I responded alot of people don't show up to that class and the prof taught some very important lessons the last few classes. As I was still trying to type what we needed to do. She responded quickly saying is anything due?and you don't have to give me sass. I wasn't done even typing what we needed to do before I started to get pissed about what she wrote to me. So, I deleted what we needed to do and typed maybe if you showed up to class you would know what was going on, now thats sass. After this all her friends and others who also miss class around 5 or 6 of them started to jump down my throat. I was called immature, I live to create drama and told to stop talking ect. I also find it funny that they all were telling me to grow up and I live to create drama considering they have taken pictures of a student in our class uploading it to the group chat and were bullying him and talking crap about him behind his back a few weeks prior. To which I showed him what they were doing because I found it disgusting. Also, the girl I was \"sassing\" was one of the main people that was bullying this student behind his back. The girl who also called me immature was answering her phone during an exam two weeks prior and when the prof told her she can't do that she said yes she has children and will do it if she needs to and was extremely rude to this nice prof. For reference the profs have said if your kids are sick ect, To give them your phone and if someone calls they will allow you to take the call privately in the hall as to not keep your phone on the desk and not disturb other students. I just feel as I honestly did nothing wrong and was made to feel bad guy for a comment that I wasn't even finished typing AITA? Also sorry for the grammar and spelling mistakes I wanted to write this before a doctor's appointment.", "created_utc": 1667561588, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylwkj1/aita_for_telling_other_students_they_should_come/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can't make them care.", "NTA. Take screenshots and send them to the professor. Let them fail the class", "NTA - If they want to waste their money on a class they're going to fail, let them. If they ask for help, stay out of it. You know, so you don't \"create drama\"; they told you to \"stop talking\" after all.", "NTA.  You don't need to carry these people on your back.  Can you talk to the prof and ask for advice on this?  You are doing what you're supposed to be doing.  Those who chronically skip are a drag to everyone.  I'm kinda surprised they don't get kicked out for more than -X- number of classses missed.  I'm sure your prof sees this every semester.  Let us know what they say.  I wouldn't bother wasting your time communicating with these people via mobile, they're clearly not invested or care.", "NTA. Sounds like this is a college/university class. They paid their money to be their and its their choice not to show up. Shocker that they're failing. If they're not going to show up they deserve to fail. The last thing I'd want is legal advice from someone who doesn't understand thier actions have consequences.", "NTA\nGoing to a university/college being a student or a teacher is a commitment. You shouldn't even help them in any assignments due, let them fail. If their personal stuffs are more important than education, they shouldn't have joined a university/college in the first place. If you join any college or educational institution, your first priority should be your education. \n\nSometimes, day or two can be okay but not everyday.", "NTA. Your only mistake was responding at all. \n\nIf you are doing work that requires people to be involved, and they are never in class, talk to your professor and ask to be re-assigned. \n\nIf it's too late to do that then lesson learned and do your best. Your professor isn't an idiot and will know how hard you tried.\n\nThese people are not friends, family, or colleagues so they serve no real purpose in your life.\n\nI'm so sorry things are so difficult right now. \ud83e\udd17", "I have already took screenshots of the bullying. The only reason I haven't sent them to the dean is because I've been swamped with midterms this past week and this coming week. But, after my tests are over for Monday and Tuesday I'm sharing them with the school. Were all supposed to be professional and I don't feel bullying is something future paralegals should be partaking in. Its just sick.", "Love this way of thinking thank you \ud83d\ude0a", "I did mention to him on Tuesday and said that no one ever shows up to this class. He recently took it over because our original professor has some serious medical issues going on with her daughter. He did mention he was going to talk with the other professors and see what they can do for us students that do show up. They also never take attendance of this particular class.", "I wish I could show the screen shots of this on here. I 100% agree with you and that's why I said something.", "Yes, I agree I see now that my down fall was ever even responding to these people. I'm not going to be communicating with this chat for here on out. The professor is a great guy and he is looking into trying to help us students who are committed. As he had to take over this class recently due to our original professor needed time off for her ill daughter.", "That's too bad.  Sounds like people take advantage.  Something needs to change but it's not your problem.  Best of luck to you going forward!!!!!", "You don't need to show me the screenshots, honey. Ik those people are AH.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude0a"]}
