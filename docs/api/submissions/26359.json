It\u2019s him and I and his 2 friends living there. We\u2019ve grown decently close in the past year and have started telling each other a lot of details about our lives. My boyfriends roommate who we will call B recently got a girlfriend a few months ago. After meeting her no one was a fan. She\u2019s blatantly very rude and disrespectful and has made jokes relating to my mom having cancer. I do not like her to say the least. B and her have a long distance relationship so that gives them a lot of time to go out on their own. One night B comes home with another girl and she spends the night in his room. The next day I wake up to his gf spamming my phone asking if he\u2019s okay because he hasn\u2019t answered her. I respond with he\u2019s okay and he got back late last night. She then asks if he was with a girl. At first I decided fuck her and wasn\u2019t going to respond, but as much as I hate her I hate cheating more. It\u2019s happened to me and there\u2019s nothing more repulsive so I ended up telling her the truth. No matter what me and his gf have going on it\u2019s girl code and I felt I had to. That was a month and a half ago. Today I found out she screenshoted our conversation and sent it out and my boyfriend came home today screaming at me that I broke the circle of trust and that I medaled in their relationship. I told him that I wouldn\u2019t outright tell B\u2019s gf what happened but I wasn\u2019t about to cover or lie for B. The 3 of them went out for drinks tonight and when they got back my boyfriend told me I need to apologize to B. He also said that neither of these roommates can trust me anymore and that I ruined their \u201csafe place\u201d and that it\u2019s something I will need to earn back.

That means that all three of them that are living in the house are very willing to cover and overlook cheating. I would not be able to trust someone that got mad at me for telling the truth about someone cheating. Did you tell them that B's GF was already suspicious that he brought a girl home?", "agreed. cheating is so normalised nowadays but to me it\u2019s a big question of morals, and I\u2019ll die on this hill. friends are shit friends if they\u2019re complicit in your fucked up behaviour and don\u2019t call you out. which makes HIM the AH friend and AH bf.", "It's not about camaraderie.

If I ever find out a friend like that is getting cheated on, I'd be so concerned but I would not force this truth upon them.\n\nEither way, OP did not act on the girl code. She meddled with their relationship as a big fuck you to B for cheating and possibly to B's gf. Clearly, OP didn't even like B's gf. Her interference in their relationship did not come from a place or support or compassion for another girl.", "How is that her problem ? Why put a strain on her bf and his friend ? But yeah cool", "If the situation was that OOP saw this and instantly called B's GF I would agree with you. But the situation is that she was asked directly by the GF, that was already suspecting cheating, to clarify. In that instance it shows that she WANTS to know. Of course OOP could just ignore it at that point too but if I was in her shoes I would also tell the GF even from a neutral standpoint of not liking or disliking either of these people.", "her bf supports cheating. I say it's not that bad to lose him", "It's not her responsibility to lie for him. She didn't divulge information the boyfriend gave her, she told the girl what she saw with her own eyes.
