It means exactly what a ring means when you are putting it on your wife\u2019s finger during the church/catholic wedding. \nSo this man is supposed to give that mangalsutra to the bride which also means that indirectly the ex boyfriend is the one making the lifetime promise, in this life and forever promise not OP, which also means that since Hindu weddings are spiritual, in spirit she is marrying her ex boyfriend not her current fiance. He\u2019s just there for appearances.\n\nDude leave this girl. Tell her parents that since she wants to use the same mangalsutra her ex boyfriend gave her then it\u2019s almost like she\u2019s getting married to her ex boyfriend. And you don\u2019t want to be a shadow of that person.\n\nEdit to add- OP you\u2019re NTA. But if you marry this person only for the sake of your parents and what the society says you\u2019ll be doing the biggest disservice to yourself. Your life will not be a happily ever after. When people show you who they are believe them. Either you can get through this with her before the marriage, or you can get through this alone. You\u2019ll be the asshole to yourself if you live in her ex boyfriend\u2019s shadow all your life.\n\nEdit2- completely forgot to address the last paragraph, she is also manipulative, and knows what she is doing is not right. Hence she doubled down and painted you as the bad guy. \nDo you think you can live with this all your life?", "NTA,\n\nHer attitude raises questions of what happened during the first relationship. Why is she so attached to something an ex gave her after they split up if he had dubious morality? What was his \"dubious morality\" in the first place. Her attitude about this whole thing is weird, if what he did was really that bad, why would she want to keep that necklace from such a bad time.. I would get it if the necklace was a family heirloom or a piece her parents got her, but this is from an ex.", "You said this necklace is the equivalent of the Christian wedding ring. I can't remember the name (forgive me, I'm not Hindu and I was told this a long time ago), but if this is the necklace I'm thinking of, isn't a woman expected to wear it for the rest of her married life, just like a wedding ring? \n\nIf so, is she sending the message that she considers herself married to her ex and no matter what wedding ceremony she attends, she doesn't consider it legitimate because she is married to her ex and not you? If I remember what my friends said from way back when, the necklace has a symbolic meaning of protecting the woman from all men other than the man who gave her the necklace... including you. It's her way of protesting against the decisions that have been made by her family -- first separating her from ex, then pairing her with you -- by symbolically marrying the man she wants while marrying the man she's allowed to have.\n\nIf I am understanding even half the significance of her act correctly, you need to sit down with your family and explain to them her refusal and your unwillingness to proceed, given the situation. Ask your married female relatives what this means... they'll understand what she's doing even deeper than you do.\n\nIt may be that you need to reconsider this marriage, but I admit that I don't fully know what the repurcussions are of backing out of an arranged marriage for either the bride or groom, which is why I suggest you approach your family; I assume there would be protocols for addressing an important problem like this that could impact the future of it, and they would be the ones to lead that discussion with your bride's family.\n\nGiven the cultural significance, I think you're right to be concerned.", "Do not get married.\n\nShe is not committed to a relationship with you.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nAs you have explained, even tho it is an arranged marriege, both of you are consenting to it. As well, this means, both of you have to respect each other. And the fact that she is willing to use the necklace of her previous engamenent its not respectful of your relationship. Try to explain that both of you deserve respect and love.", "Actually SHE showed YOU her true colors.  She's not mentally or emotionally mature enough to enter into a marriage. Wearing another man's jewelry as a \"wedding\" piece is beyond disrespectful and it's kind of obvious she's still in love with her previous boyfriend.\n\nBreak off the engagement and find a woman who wants to marry YOU.", "NTA. She\u2019s manipulating you and gaslighting you into thinking you\u2019re wrong and being controlling. You are not. You are 100% right. The necklace is meant to symbolize your marriage. The two of you. Not her ex. Every time you\u2019ll look at her you will think of her ex and how she is wearing his necklace and not yours. \n\nShe isn\u2019t over her ex. Don\u2019t marry her.", "No. As a Hindu myself, it\u2019s a hard NO. Who in their right mind goes into a new marriage with items from their exes unless she is still stuck on him.\n\nPs. Show her this post and the responses.", "Do not marry this person. Call it off now while you still can. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. This wedding needs to be called off too, I think, this time because of dubious morality on the bride's side.", "Nta\n\nCan you talk with her parents about what the deal with the ex was? Or asking your mum to talk with hers?\n\nSounds like she isn't over her ex", "I am from OP's Culture and a married woman that wears this kind of necklace. I would never ever think of wearing this symbol bought by anyone else apart from my husband cause it has a very prominent place in a married woman's life. It's possible that she likes the design but that can always be replicated in a different way but using the same exact necklace is a huge no no. \nAnother thing to note is the groom is the one who pays for it for his bride (the groom puts it on her during the ceremony) so wearing the old one is clearly crossing a line.", "NTA, sounds like your fianc\u00e9e has some dubious morality.", "NTA- I have to beg you not to marry this woman. I say this because she refuses to give up on an old boyfriend.  I would not wear any jewelry my boyfriend gave me in the past, especially on my wedding day. I know it is hard, but please really think about this marriage.  Sounds like she still loves her ex a lot.", "NTA. The necklace has spiritual-astrological implications and will tie your marriage and household with that individual in unbeknownst ways and will play in the back of everyone\u2019s minds. Back away. \n\nOne other thing. I think we should make a AITDesiAH just because of topics like this, there being a sufficient number of us in the English cyber space, and not needing to go through lengthy paragraphs of labor explaining basic cultural items lol", "NTA what if you had one made that was similar but different enough? \n\nI know the rings I bought my wife for our wedding / engagement look similar to what her first husband bought. It is what she likes and nothing else suited her.", "Call this marriage off her behaviour is unacceptable she's attached to that jewellery and she's practically disrespecting you and calling you her ex's shadow OP is NTA(Im hindu and in Hinduism the necklace he's talking about has a lot of significance and meaning its like connecting the couple together for the rest of their lives and their rebirth in spiritual form and not just emotional)", "NTA. Seems like her prior marriage was canceled with everything except her consent, and that your marriage with her is not what she truly wants. I wouldn\u2019t like my wife to be to reuse her prior wedding ring for our marriage, so it seems like a legit reaction to me. \n\nBut in a broader context, we\u2019re in 2023, not in the 1800\u2019s anymore. I respect your religion and cultural background, but these arranged marriages can seem absurd at our times, and you should seek for whoever makes you happy, not whoever your family tells you to marry.", "NTA. It sounds like she isn\u2019t over the ex. I would call off the wedding. The fact she called you a bunch of names instead of understanding that any reasonable person would not want his bride to wear or even still have a necklace from a former fianc\u00e9 is a huge red flag. \ud83d\udea9 run", "NTA - she sounds like a real gem. Please don\u2019t marry someone who has no respect for you", "Question :- The necklace you're talking about, does it have black coloured beads in it? \nWhen Hindu people get married, the groom gives a necklace to the bride which is called Mangalsutra. It has black beards and a pandent (mostly made of gold).It is one of the essential pieces of jewellery which women have to wear because it shows that she is married. \nNTA from my side", "Not the ass hole let this girl go", "NTA - she wants to use the same ceremonial jewelry from her ex boyfriend? Time to walk away, dude. Sorry", "NTA\n\nShe's disrespecting you and your family on a fundamental level and she is very well aware of this herself. Is her family aware of her intent? Is your family aware?\n\nI would think that she is not willing to get married if she's suggesting using the necklace of her ex. I'm not Indian, but if you say the necklace has the same meaning as a ring in Christian weddings, then it is unacceptable.", "There is no way in hell I would agree to have married my wife if she wanted to use a ring her ex gave her. I put a lot of time and love into the ring I designed for her and neither of us would have it any other way. NTA for sure.", "NTA.\n\nThis is probably her way of calling off the engagement  without calling it off, and letting you take the heat.", "*<She basically just called me a lot of names, and I am wondering whether I did anything wrong.>*\n\nYes you are doing something wrong, you are marrying the wrong girl.\n\nSHE is the one showing her true colours.\n\n*<it had been called off at the end due to questions of dubious morality on the groom's side.>*\n\nINFO : are you sure the questions weren't about HER dubious morality 'cause her morality sure is dubious now.\n\nNTA", "Where is the misogyny in not wanting that the woman you love and are marrying uses the necklace her ex fianc\u00e9 gave her in your wedding ceremony?

Wait, I know now where is the misogyny in this issue...", "I agree. This is a bad choice for you.", "I would day it's her choice but I woukd also say it's a terrible choice. \n\nAre you sure she is for you?", "NTA - I'm familiar with the Hindu rituals and the importance of the \"wedding necklace\". It's a red flag that she wants to wear the one gifted by her ex bf, having said that you haven't bought one for your upcoming wedding, gifting the necklace is a significant part of the ceremony, so maybe she's doing this to motivate you into buying one!", "Nta. This is a major problem and I would postpone or cancel the wedding. It seems she is not over her ex.", "Tell her if she wears it, you will say no at the altar.", "Absolutely NTA.  If your wife insists on using something from her ex on her wedding day, she's definitely not over them.\n\nI even replaced a pan that I \"accidentally\" threw out that my wife's ex had given her that she insisted on keeping using.", "Still time bro,  if she can't understand why you don't want the neck given to her by her ex and says you're controlling time to speak to her family members .

Your NTA for not wanting her to wear her ex BF\u2019s jewelry - especially since its equal to a wedding ring!", "NTA - Even if the mangalsutra wasn't an important symbolic part of this ritual, I would still think it inappropriate for her to wear it to her wedding to someone else.  As it was explained very well by u/Glitter_dealer (thank you so much) I think this is a massive red flag. She accused you of showing your true colours, but seriously she's shown you hers...doing something like this seems very disrespectful to you.\n\nI'd postpone the wedding at the very least.", "NTA.

Your life will be hell.", "NTA and surprised she can't see the issue.", "NTA- even if he had passed reusing the engagement ring (or necklace) wouldn\u2019t be ok. You\u2019re not a proxy for the dude she really wants to be marrying.\n\nIf I had to guess- her family likely pressured her into calling off the previous engagement ring. They\u2019re also probably pushing her pretty hard to get married to someone they feel is acceptable (that\u2019s you).

That she (and maybe you too) are pushed into this arranged marriage that she clearly doesn't want. Perhaps her insisting on wearing this necklace, which I imagine can only be seen as insulting to you as the future husband, is her only way to try to prevent this marriage between you and her.\n\nSorry man, I am not in your culture, so I can't give you advice that will apply to your specific situation that is understanding of your situation.\n\nIt sounds like she doesn't want this. Do you want to marry someone who doesn't want to marry you?\n\nI do think she's making an ahole move by wearing this necklace as I can see how it's insulting, but she may have no other options to try to prevent this marriage (if that is what her aim is). Maybe you are both the victim here?\n\nTalk to your parents about this or perhaps uncles/aunts, someone more mature who understands your culture's rules but who also cares about your happiness, and see what can be done to ensure everyone's happiness/that no one is forced.\n\nWhat do you mean by 'dated each other'? How long have you been dating each other? Did you get any time with her one to one or was there always a chaperone/you only went to public places and didn't have private time without others around? I think the fact she insists on wearing this necklace from her ex tells me that she's not over him (even if she still had some feelings for him, which is normal, she'd just keep the necklace at home in a box and move on, accepting a necklace for this specific occasion, if she wanted to marry you).", "I\u2019ve known what I want my engagement ring to look like since I was a teenager, before any serious boyfriends happened. Because I know what I like in jewellry. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your fiance knew what necklace she wanted way before her ex. \n\nIf she gave her ex specific instructions on what it should look like, she probably wants a necklace that looks the same, regardless of where it came from. And it might seem like a waste of money to buy another necklace that is pretty much the same as one she already has.\n\nSo I\u2019d say NTA but get her side of things before deciding if she\u2019s still attached to her ex or just attached to the necklace design.\n\nTo clarify since this is getting downvoted, judgement is NTA. She should get a new necklace. But if she\u2019s attached to the design, that\u2019s a fixable problem.
