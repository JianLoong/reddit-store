It means exactly what a ring means when you are putting it on your wife\u2019s finger during the church/catholic wedding. \nSo this man is supposed to give that mangalsutra to the bride which also means that indirectly the ex boyfriend is the one making the lifetime promise, in this life and forever promise not OP, which also means that since Hindu weddings are spiritual, in spirit she is marrying her ex boyfriend not her current fiance. He\u2019s just there for appearances.\n\nDude leave this girl. Tell her parents that since she wants to use the same mangalsutra her ex boyfriend gave her then it\u2019s almost like she\u2019s getting married to her ex boyfriend. And you don\u2019t want to be a shadow of that person.\n\nEdit to add- OP you\u2019re NTA. But if you marry this person only for the sake of your parents and what the society says you\u2019ll be doing the biggest disservice to yourself. Your life will not be a happily ever after. When people show you who they are believe them. Either you can get through this with her before the marriage, or you can get through this alone. You\u2019ll be the asshole to yourself if you live in her ex boyfriend\u2019s shadow all your life.\n\nEdit2- completely forgot to address the last paragraph, she is also manipulative, and knows what she is doing is not right. Hence she doubled down and painted you as the bad guy. \nDo you think you can live with this all your life?", "NTA,\n\nHer attitude raises questions of what happened during the first relationship. Why is she so attached to something an ex gave her after they split up if he had dubious morality? What was his \"dubious morality\" in the first place. Her attitude about this whole thing is weird, if what he did was really that bad, why would she want to keep that necklace from such a bad time.. I would get it if the necklace was a family heirloom or a piece her parents got her, but this is from an ex.", "You said this necklace is the equivalent of the Christian wedding ring. I can't remember the name (forgive me, I'm not Hindu and I was told this a long time ago), but if this is the necklace I'm thinking of, isn't a woman expected to wear it for the rest of her married life, just like a wedding ring? \n\nIf so, is she sending the message that she considers herself married to her ex and no matter what wedding ceremony she attends, she doesn't consider it legitimate because she is married to her ex and not you? If I remember what my friends said from way back when, the necklace has a symbolic meaning of protecting the woman from all men other than the man who gave her the necklace... including you. It's her way of protesting against the decisions that have been made by her family -- first separating her from ex, then pairing her with you -- by symbolically marrying the man she wants while marrying the man she's allowed to have.\n\nIf I am understanding even half the significance of her act correctly, you need to sit down with your family and explain to them her refusal and your unwillingness to proceed, given the situation. Ask your married female relatives what this means... they'll understand what she's doing even deeper than you do.\n\nIt may be that you need to reconsider this marriage, but I admit that I don't fully know what the repurcussions are of backing out of an arranged marriage for either the bride or groom, which is why I suggest you approach your family; I assume there would be protocols for addressing an important problem like this that could impact the future of it, and they would be the ones to lead that discussion with your bride's family.\n\nGiven the cultural significance, I think you're right to be concerned.", "Do not get married.\n\nShe is not committed to a relationship with you.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nAs you have explained, even tho it is an arranged marriege, both of you are consenting to it. As well, this means, both of you have to respect each other. And the fact that she is willing to use the necklace of her previous engamenent its not respectful of your relationship. Try to explain that both of you deserve respect and love.", "Actually SHE showed YOU her true colors.  She's not mentally or emotionally mature enough to enter into a marriage. Wearing another man's jewelry as a \"wedding\" piece is beyond disrespectful and it's kind of obvious she's still in love with her previous boyfriend.\n\nBreak off the engagement and find a woman who wants to marry YOU.", "NTA. She\u2019s manipulating you and gaslighting you into thinking you\u2019re wrong and being controlling. You are not. You are 100% right. The necklace is meant to symbolize your marriage. The two of you. Not her ex. Every time you\u2019ll look at her you will think of her ex and how she is wearing his necklace and not yours. \n\nShe isn\u2019t over her ex. Don\u2019t marry her.", "No. As a Hindu myself, it\u2019s a hard NO. Who in their right mind goes into a new marriage with items from their exes unless she is still stuck on him.\n\nPs. Show her this post and the responses.", "Do not marry this person. Call it off now while you still can. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. This wedding needs to be called off too, I think, this time because of dubious morality on the bride's side.", "Nta\n\nCan you talk with her parents about what the deal with the ex was? Or asking your mum to talk with hers?\n\nSounds like she isn't over her ex", "I am from OP's Culture and a married woman that wears this kind of necklace. I would never ever think of wearing this symbol bought by anyone else apart from my husband cause it has a very prominent place in a married woman's life. It's possible that she likes the design but that can always be replicated in a different way but using the same exact necklace is a huge no no. \nAnother thing to note is the groom is the one who pays for it for his bride (the groom puts it on her during the ceremony) so wearing the old one is clearly crossing a line.", "NTA, sounds like your fianc\u00e9e has some dubious morality.", "NTA- I have to beg you not to marry this woman. I say this because she refuses to give up on an old boyfriend.  I would not wear any jewelry my boyfriend gave me in the past, especially on my wedding day. I know it is hard, but please really think about this marriage.  Sounds like she still loves her ex a lot.", "NTA. The necklace has spiritual-astrological implications and will tie your marriage and household with that individual in unbeknownst ways and will play in the back of everyone\u2019s minds. Back away. \n\nOne other thing. I think we should make a AITDesiAH just because of topics like this, there being a sufficient number of us in the English cyber space, and not needing to go through lengthy paragraphs of labor explaining basic cultural items lol", "NTA what if you had one made that was similar but different enough? \n\nI know the rings I bought my wife for our wedding / engagement look similar to what her first husband bought. It is what she likes and nothing else suited her.", "Call this marriage off her behaviour is unacceptable she's attached to that jewellery and she's practically disrespecting you and calling you her ex's shadow OP is NTA(Im hindu and in Hinduism the necklace he's talking about has a lot of significance and meaning its like connecting the couple together for the rest of their lives and their rebirth in spiritual form and not just emotional)", "NTA. Seems like her prior marriage was canceled with everything except her consent, and that your marriage with her is not what she truly wants. I wouldn\u2019t like my wife to be to reuse her prior wedding ring for our marriage, so it seems like a legit reaction to me. \n\nBut in a broader context, we\u2019re in 2023, not in the 1800\u2019s anymore. I respect your religion and cultural background, but these arranged marriages can seem absurd at our times, and you should seek for whoever makes you happy, not whoever your family tells you to marry.", "NTA. It sounds like she isn\u2019t over the ex. I would call off the wedding. The fact she called you a bunch of names instead of understanding that any reasonable person would not want his bride to wear or even still have a necklace from a former fianc\u00e9 is a huge red flag. \ud83d\udea9 run", "NTA - she sounds like a real gem. Please don\u2019t marry someone who has no respect for you", "Question :- The necklace you're talking about, does it have black coloured beads in it? \nWhen Hindu people get married, the groom gives a necklace to the bride which is called Mangalsutra. It has black beards and a pandent (mostly made of gold).It is one of the essential pieces of jewellery which women have to wear because it shows that she is married. \nNTA from my side", "Not the ass hole let this girl go", "NTA - she wants to use the same ceremonial jewelry from her ex boyfriend? Time to walk away, dude. Sorry", "NTA\n\nShe's disrespecting you and your family on a fundamental level and she is very well aware of this herself. Is her family aware of her intent? Is your family aware?\n\nI would think that she is not willing to get married if she's suggesting using the necklace of her ex. I'm not Indian, but if you say the necklace has the same meaning as a ring in Christian weddings, then it is unacceptable.", "There is no way in hell I would agree to have married my wife if she wanted to use a ring her ex gave her. I put a lot of time and love into the ring I designed for her and neither of us would have it any other way. NTA for sure.", "NTA.\n\nThis is probably her way of calling off the engagement  without calling it off, and letting you take the heat.", "*<She basically just called me a lot of names, and I am wondering whether I did anything wrong.>*\n\nYes you are doing something wrong, you are marrying the wrong girl.\n\nSHE is the one showing her true colours.\n\n*<it had been called off at the end due to questions of dubious morality on the groom's side.>*\n\nINFO : are you sure the questions weren't about HER dubious morality 'cause her morality sure is dubious now.\n\nNTA", "Where is the misogyny in not wanting that the woman you love and are marrying uses the necklace her ex fianc\u00e9 gave her in your wedding ceremony?

Wait, I know now where is the misogyny in this issue...", "I agree. This is a bad choice for you.", "I would day it's her choice but I woukd also say it's a terrible choice. \n\nAre you sure she is for you?", "NTA - I'm familiar with the Hindu rituals and the importance of the \"wedding necklace\". It's a red flag that she wants to wear the one gifted by her ex bf, having said that you haven't bought one for your upcoming wedding, gifting the necklace is a significant part of the ceremony, so maybe she's doing this to motivate you into buying one!", "Nta. This is a major problem and I would postpone or cancel the wedding. It seems she is not over her ex.", "Tell her if she wears it, you will say no at the altar.", "Absolutely NTA.  If your wife insists on using something from her ex on her wedding day, she's definitely not over them.\n\nI even replaced a pan that I \"accidentally\" threw out that my wife's ex had given her that she insisted on keeping using.", "Still time bro,  if she can't understand why you don't want the neck given to her by her ex and says you're controlling time to speak to her family members .

Your NTA for not wanting her to wear her ex BF\u2019s jewelry - especially since its equal to a wedding ring!", "NTA - Even if the mangalsutra wasn't an important symbolic part of this ritual, I would still think it inappropriate for her to wear it to her wedding to someone else.  As it was explained very well by u/Glitter_dealer (thank you so much) I think this is a massive red flag. She accused you of showing your true colours, but seriously she's shown you hers...doing something like this seems very disrespectful to you.\n\nI'd postpone the wedding at the very least.", "NTA.

You\u2019re not a proxy for the dude she really wants to be marrying.\n\nIf I had to guess- her family likely pressured her into calling off the previous engagement ring.

That she (and maybe you too) are pushed into this arranged marriage that she clearly doesn't want. Perhaps her insisting on wearing this necklace, which I imagine can only be seen as insulting to you as the future husband, is her only way to try to prevent this marriage between you and her.\n\nSorry man, I am not in your culture, so I can't give you advice that will apply to your specific situation that is understanding of your situation.\n\nIt sounds like she doesn't want this. Do you want to marry someone who doesn't want to marry you?\n\nI do think she's making an ahole move by wearing this necklace as I can see how it's insulting, but she may have no other options to try to prevent this marriage (if that is what her aim is). Maybe you are both the victim here?\n\nTalk to your parents about this or perhaps uncles/aunts, someone more mature who understands your culture's rules but who also cares about your happiness, and see what can be done to ensure everyone's happiness/that no one is forced.\n\nWhat do you mean by 'dated each other'? How long have you been dating each other? Did you get any time with her one to one or was there always a chaperone/you only went to public places and didn't have private time without others around? I think the fact she insists on wearing this necklace from her ex tells me that she's not over him (even if she still had some feelings for him, which is normal, she'd just keep the necklace at home in a box and move on, accepting a necklace for this specific occasion, if she wanted to marry you).", "I\u2019ve known what I want my engagement ring to look like since I was a teenager, before any serious boyfriends happened.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your fiance knew what necklace she wanted way before her ex. \n\nIf she gave her ex specific instructions on what it should look like, she probably wants a necklace that looks the same, regardless of where it came from.

In this instance there is nothing to suggest actual manipulation or gaslighting.", "Yeah, it's just we did not want to rush buying it earlier, we thought a few weeks before the wedding would be okay.", "Exactly and how can her ex give her mangal sutra? OP is saying necklace is equivalent to a wedding ring. In that case he is talking about mangal sutra. \n\nAnd if he is talking about any other ornament which the bride wears, it's still weird that they haven't returned it to her ex. We are talking about gold jewellery which belongs to some else.", "Damn the bride. But yea, I do know girls like that.", "So you think someone who was engaged to be married before choosing to get married with a ring given to them by an ex is also valid?", "Definitely, and it\u2019s his choice not to marry someone who wants to use what was given to her by a prior fianc\u00e9 to be the symbol of commitment and unity in marriage as the symbol of commitment and unity for his relationship with her now. Easy dealbreaker there. \n\nOP is NTA. She is not over the last relationship and is accusing the OP of absurd things to cover it up. Parents forced the breakup. What a great way for her to marry the last guy in spirit while going through the motions with the OP.", "So you would accept a Engagement ring from your partner of his ex ? Just accept that you were wrong. It's not that hard.", "Of course it is, because she still loves her ex.", "Arranged marriages are not all the same, and the assumption that no one involved has any strong feelings is an incorrect one. Saying 'who cares because it's arranged' is ignorant and short sighted. People matter even when they aren't being sold the Disney idea of romance.", "I don't think there is enough information to make that conclusion.  Yes, its arranged, but there are various levels of that, from knowing someone very well to not knowing them at all.", "Mate she's literally planning on wearing a mangalsutra that was given to her by an ex fiance for the rituals with OP. So according to you, her outright disrespect isn't a shitty way of starting a marriage?", "Tell me you\u2019re a doormat and spineless without telling me\u2026.", "[deleted]", "It was there when the post was made. It was aways there.", "Plenty of women don't wear mangalsutras either. But if you're doing the ceremony the context cannot be omitted", "Since you didn\u2019t exchange rings, was your spouse also onboard and with the same thought that its just a piece of jewellery?", "You are the outlier, not the norm", "Exactly. She\u2019s forcing him into a corner", "This is the impression I got. Even if it\u2019s not about the ex she seems to be looking for a reason to end this engagement.", "Genuinely asking, can you not buy her the same or very close to similar necklace if it's the style she likes so much?\n\nBut honestly, it seems like her real attachment to the necklace is that her ex gave it to her.  I think that's why she won't return it and why she refuses to get another one.", "Well maybe it is not that he is more important and more that OP is not important.", "That's what they told us. It's what I know.", "There are plenty of people who continue to simp for their SO's that have cheated on them.", "\u201cTo gaslight someone means to manipulate another person into doubting their own perceptions, experiences or understanding of events\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s literally what is happening here. He knows there is a deeper meaning behind the necklace and she\u2019s trying to get him to doubt that reality.", "Stop gaslighting me", "Except she is literally gaslighting OP in this case by calling him mysoginistic and \u201ccontrolling\u201d when OP expressed a very natural reaction to not wanting to use his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s ex\u2019s wedding necklace for OP\u2019s wedding ceremony. She\u2019s invalidating OP\u2019s very valid feelings through denial and dismissiveness.\n\nYou know, pretty much the very definition of gaslighting.", "Dude, you don't have to be such an asshole about it. If it bothers you that much, politely explain what gaslighting actually is and why this isn't an example of it.\n\nFor the record though, OP's fianc\u00e9e is 100% manipulating him. She's trying to make him believe it's \"just a necklace\" of no significance so that  he puts it on her at the wedding and she'll get to pretend she's married to her ex.", "I don't understand why this wouldn't be valid.\n\nIf you were in a relationship, had talked about marriage and rings and asked for a specific one but then your fiance cheated on you, it doesn't change that the ring is the ring you wanted.\n\nAre you saying that even if the ring someone wants is EXACTLY the same as the one they have already their new partner should literally buy them a duplicate ring instead of just saving the money and letting them wear the one they have??", "Respect", "Actually my wife has a wedding ring and a engagement band, she perfers to wear them 24/7 even showering. I have ADHD and am very fidgeting so I happen to play w/loose jewelry and so yes my wife and I had that talk and she's perfectly okay with my boundaries and opinions of the jewelry aspect. My wife also still has jewerly she has gotten from exa for things like school graduations/achievements from before weve been together. She loves jewerly and collects it, i hate it and refuse to wear anything but my piercings. I'm just saying not every girl is going to connect the jewelry to an ex, sometimes it's simply the jewelry is pretty and they feel pretty wearing it.", "Actually in this day and age may people go without their wedding rings, many people also simply get bands tattooed on their finger. Acting like you need a ring to have a healthy marriage is weird to me, after all jewerly doesn't magically make your marriage work the people in it do that's what important.", "As a godless American, good for her. Arranged marriages are fucked up", "Either way, it\u2019s not a relationship that should continue and definitely not into a marriage.", "I know its culturally not something you can do, but forget the parents right now.  Have you actually sat down with her and asked her what really happened?\n\nClearly the parents broke her last relationship off, and its not what she wanted.  \"Oh he cheated on her\" is an easy answer that people won't look too hard at.  But she's clearly still in love with the guy, which doesn't make sense if he was actually cheating on her.\n\nMy wife caught the guy she was engaged to marry before me cheating on her 2 weeks before the wedding.  Long story short, he's lucky he made it out alive.  Betrayed love turns into hate REAL FAST.\n\nThat she doesn't resent him, and wants to use his necklace tells me that there is more going on here than you're being told.", "OP don\u2019t take them at their word without proof at this point. I know someone who was seriously mistreated by in laws, it was so bad that even her village relatives couldn\u2019t criticise her divorce! Now the other party has moved, and they say she \u201cran away\u201d because of her \u201caffair\u201d, obviously that\u2019s a lie to make their child look like the \u201creal\u201d victim. \n\nYou should investigate and see if the other man was actually what they say.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Yeah no, thats not what gaslighting is.\n\nGaslighting is stuff like taking your keys off the table, you hunt everywhere for them, and then they put them back in plain sight and go \"They're right here in front of you, silly\".\n\nBeing defensive and not wanting to talk about a real reason, and lashing out when pushed, is not gaslighting.", "cant respect someone you don't love", "I get your point. But the context of mangalsutra is completely different. \nWould you be okay if your wife asked you to put on a wedding ring on her on the day of your wedding that her last fianc\u00e9 gave to her if it essentially means the ex fianc\u00e9 is the one marrying her then? \nIt\u2019s completely okay to keep a piece of jewellery without any emotions attached to it. But mangalsutra is a sacred piece of necklace that ties the husband and wife together as a married couple. It\u2019s something a groom buys for their to be wife. And they are having an all traditional wedding. It\u2019s culturally important if you\u2019re going to have a traditional hindu wedding.", "Based on your comment of \"That's what they told us\", it sounds like she didn't even really know why it ended, she was just told it was over and that was that.\n\nWas he actually cheating on her?  Was that just a story made up by her parents because they didn't approve of the guy, or didn't think he was good enough, or maybe just some petty slight?  I don't know.\n\nBut it definitely sounds like SHE isn't convinced thats what happened.  And it doesn't sound like she ever got any closure on it.", "As someone non religious being completely honest, no I wouldn't care at all. I genuinely think all religions are culty the way people blindly follow them so harshly and the way they try to impose that on their children most the time. The only way I see it is the ones saying I do are the ones getting married. Last fiance giving it to her or not that doesn't mean he's the one marring her because he's not the one in the marriage every day. That's just my own opinion honestly. But them again I also wouldn't say in a religion where my parents got to pick my partner, sometimes being alone is better than being controlled.", "Living in India, I can assure you more \"I can change him\" \" it's okay to put up cheating\" girls exist here, especially if they have already gotten physical. Parents, on the other hand, are more sensible and do not wish to hand over their child to such man.\n\nJust in case, I'm early 20s female and I've seen my friends act like this towards their bf and thus I formed this opinion. \n\nAlso very less chance, she'll not know why the marriage was called off. Phones, friends, social media can very easy access to gossips after all."]}
