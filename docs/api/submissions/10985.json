These days I'm mostly housebound, but back when I wasn't I often desperately needed somewhere to sit just for 5-10 minutes if I'd been out for a while. There's nothing wrong with holding a seat for someone who is literally in line getting your coffee; but in a busy Starbucks on a weekend afternoon there is literally NO excuse for \"saving seats\" for people who haven't arrived when there are people right there who need to sit. As in a restaurant, if their entire party was not yet there and ready to be seated, they should have been waiting until their friends got there to grab a table.", "NTA, but this escalated more than it needed to.  Always tell a manager.", "NTA.  However, you didn't use the best judgement.  It's the store's job to address seating, not another customer's.", "NTA. They're the AHs for hogging seats.", "NTA. They shouldn\u2019t have been holding the seats.", "NTA They were for holding seats like that.", "NTA. But you need to tell a manager, not try to deal with this situation by yourself.", "NTA - but I agree with u/SirMittensOfTheHill to get a manager involved. You're not being a Karen. You're being empathetic towards others.", "the 65 year man actually screamed at you? like at the top of his lungs, full force, actually *screamed* at you?", "Info : Are you an employee, or just someone in the store waiting for a seat?", "ESH.  They shouldn\u2019t hold seats. Any you need to mind your business. It wasn\u2019t effecting you at all, but why do you feel it\u2019s your role to call them out.

I always wear a big jacket to cover it since I don't want to gross ppl out and have kids see it..even now I have to sit down often and it'll suck a ton to see seats taken for so long I'd probably just steal one because I just can't stand anymore and the pouch weight would pull the Stent and it would hurt,also crowded places make me nervous as someone can easily bump into me and unknowingly hurt me without realizing it", "Fair, I don\u2019t disagree I am probably an asshole/morale police to some extent.\n\nBut I gave them 30minutes to be good people, then I turned into the morale police to give them a taste of their own medicine."]}
