These days I'm mostly housebound, but back when I wasn't I often desperately needed somewhere to sit just for 5-10 minutes if I'd been out for a while. There's nothing wrong with holding a seat for someone who is literally in line getting your coffee; but in a busy Starbucks on a weekend afternoon there is literally NO excuse for \"saving seats\" for people who haven't arrived when there are people right there who need to sit. As in a restaurant, if their entire party was not yet there and ready to be seated, they should have been waiting until their friends got there to grab a table.", "NTA, but this escalated more than it needed to.

I've worked in a coffee shop like that. Don't do the staff's job. If you have an issue with someone taking up seating, you talk to the staff or the manager and let them deal with it.
