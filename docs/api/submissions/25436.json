I can\u2019t believe your friend is so afraid of being alone that she willingly putting the mental and physical health of her kids & their friends at risk. \n\nHe locked her & the kids out of their home and is attracted to little girls. Her husband is one sick son of a b**ch!  Can you report your concerns to CPS?  Your friend needs counseling and her kids need to be removed from that horrible home!", "NTA - What in the ever loving fuck is she thinking not getting rid of this guy and keeping him away from her children and her children's friends ASAP?\n\nHow could you ever support this utter madness as a spouse? \n\nYou are well rid. Unfortunately as he has not actually committed a crime and there's no evidence of him even saying this apart from via the wife, you can't involve police but I'd be making as many of your circle of friends and associates aware as soon as possible exactly why you've chosen to end the friendship and distance yourself.", "NTA, but please do something about this man :( I know probably there aren't many options until he actually commits the crime, but there are options to control the situation:\n1. I wouldn't stop being friends with her, for sole purpose of monitoring him. \n2. Make sure she writes to you all the things about him. So instead of calling you, tell her to text or email you, so you have written proof of what he is like.\n3. Start a little \"manipulation\" on your friend. F.e. take her to volunteer in some hospital/ foundation that treats SA children. Take her to a movie about child trafficking. Make \"fake friends\" with some other woman who's child was SA, so she can share her story. Start with things not too obvious, but go on with it. She needs to understand how dangerous he is. \n4. If he commits any SA, go to police. For now you can contact some lawyer and explore options about it. Maybe there are some laws he can fall under.", "You can only try so hard to get her to run away from that creep. Whether she does or not, you need to get away too. NTA", "Your friend needs a listener. But for your mental health this is a lot of intensely disturbing material. She needs to meet with a counselor and you could consider meeting virtually by chat only. This gets things documented should scary get creepy. You are doing her a favor by archiving to a file this trauma as personal safety could be an issue.", "NTA! \n\nTo me, it seems your friend needs help but she not ready to see it. She\u2019s in an abusive relationship, she\u2019s a victim, unfortunately the victims are always the last to realize that. \n\nYou know your friend, so ask yourself, is this who she really is or has she been \u2018molded\u2019 into this person. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s not responsible for her own choices but abuse is a serious, difficult and complicated situation to escape from. Solutions which are obvious from the outside seem unfathomable to the person inside.\n\nVictim can be beaten inches from death but still feel responsible for the bruised knuckles of their abusers. Psychological abuse is just as dangerous and complicated.", "NTA. But I think, she is right, you should talk about it further, maybe you can get some common sense into her. You are friends for a long time, you really should try to help her seeing things clear. Hope it works. If not, you can still end the friendship.", "NAH if you can't be friends with this person, I understand.

I worry for when his sons have girlfriend's and bring them over to meet the parents.", "NTA and damn her husband basically says I might sexually assault a minor and she is cool with that. I feel bad for her kids but fuck her she doesn't deserve to be your friend.", "NTA but report his ass to the police asap", "NTA, but advise your friend if she has any written evidence he said this - did he text it to her etc. - she needs to save that evidence.  Is there someone with more influence over her or will multiple friends telling her she needs to get out of this marriage help it sink in?  She needs to speak with a divorce lawyer without him knowing because if/when she divorces she needs to be 1000% sure he has NO unsupervised visits with any children, including his son. The fact that he has not acted on this yet may make it harder to make a credible report to the appropriate agency, but if he is in a position with supervisory authority over children, such as a sports coach, teacher, youth pastor, scout leader, then this needs to be reported to those groups so he can be removed from those positions.  I would also be concerned about children in the neighborhood.  Also, the fact that he actually admitted this might mean he is open to getting psychological help, which might be of some use at least in controlling his actions if not in changing him, and has the added benefit of creating a record that will prevent him from having unsupervised custody of his own children.  However, the fact that the wife thinks this is somehow okay is heartbreaking.", "It\u2019s frightening that he states he didn\u2019t trust himself. So what, is all it takes him being alone with a little girl at the park when his child runs off to play? This is very scary that he openly admits it. Please please please let someone know. It\u2019s better to be proactive than reactive and have regret.", "The problem is that he only admitted \"feelings.\" If nothing has technically happened (that they can prove, anyway) he won't be arrested.", "This!", "Her friend needs a divorce.", "I have tried for the last year to be her sounding board and offer her advice about him and her children...I did tell her if she needs me to reach out and I'll be there but that for me and my family I can't be an active part of her life as long as he is in it.", "She refuses to get a divorce... she sees this as an issue with his faith...she doesn't want anyone to know and he doesn't want to get help. Though I have informed some people since this involves children I won't let my silence let them suffer.", "I let the parents of the girl who was invited to the sleepover aware that she shouldn't be going to their home and why.", "That's true. I'll change my reply.", "That may be what she needs, you know the situation best", "This is awful. Can you speak to the pastor at her church, if the pastor is the sort who would help and not sweep this under the rug?  She needs to understand the danger she is putting her own son (yes even if she does not have a daughter) and other children in.  Many times p\\*\\*\\*philes were abused as children themselves, including by men, so I would not rule out the father having been victimized when himself a child, and accordingly his son potentially being at some risk; some number of p\\*\\*\\*philes do not victimize their own children, only other children, but you cannot know. There is some liklihood the husband has visited child p\\*rn sites and if he has downloaded any onto his own computer he can be arrested for that.  He may also be trying to communicate with minors via the internet.  Sorry, but an arrest record for this guy may be the best way to protect others.  There must be a better place to get advice for this than this sub-reddit though.  I'm sorry you are carrying this weight.", "You should consider filing an anonymous tip that he might have CSAM. If he is openly telling his wife he is attracted to children the likelihood that he has CSAM is extremely high. \n\nhttps://www.stopitnow.org/ohc-content/when-and-how-to-file", "I am in contact with others outside of this post on how to best keep children around him safe, especially since the wife isn't willing to help. This is mostly to see if I really should try to keep our friendship despite her seemingly being okay with his behavior."]}
