They were dating for 4 years, and heather was hinting at him proposing. However they broke up when my son got drunk and ranted about how much he wanted to break up with her, what he hated about her, and how she wasnt his type.\n\nHeather went through his phone, and saw messages on how he was planning to break up with her before he went on a trip with friends. He wanted to break up with her for a while, but ever did. It was his friends who convinced him. Heather broke up with him first, and she was a mess.\n\nMy husband I love heather, and after they broke up, we were disappointed in our son but we still love in. We still talk to heather, she is family to us. She comes to dinner a few times a month, and we invite her to holidays and our birthdays. My son gets upset at this, but we kept inviting her.\n\nMy son has started dating a new girl for a few months, and he wants us to meet her for the first time before he leaves to her country and meet her family. He made it clear heather was not to come.\n\nWhile i would accept that condition, I think it would be best for his new girlfriend to know how my son acted. I told my husband, and he blew up on me. Saying it wasn\u2019t appropriate, no one wants to meet an ex, and if we focus on his past he\u2019s never going to get a relationship, or give him room to change.\n\nHowever his gf is going to meet heather sometime soon anyways, we invite her to every gathering. Heather also wants to meet my sons gf.\n\nMy husband told our son, and he cancelled the meeting.\n\nSo aita? His gf has the right to know.", "created_utc": 1691768245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15oc74t/aita_for_wanting_my_sons_exgf_around_when_my_son/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Omg, with parents like you who need enemies. \n\nShe needs to know things by your son's mouth not by his lunatic mother trying to meddle and force his ex onto her. Why you are damaging your sons life like that???\n\nYou are a cruel person. Your son did nothing wrong. He only didn't know how to break up, also Heather INVADED HIS PRIVECY by going through his phone and you are on her side. Wtf, op?!\n\nAnd what that poor new girlfriend did so wrong for you to be willing to be upfront rude with her and making her uncomfortable? \n\nHope your son get away as possible from all of you.\n\nYou need serious therapy.

Why would she even want to be in those situations?  She needs to move on.", "WTF is wrong with you? Why are you disappointed with your son breaking up with a girl he wasn't hapy with?

YTA.", "YTA- would you have wanted to meet your husbands parents for the first time when y\u2019all were younger and have them drop the bomb that his ex would be meeting and hanging with you guys also? Come tf on. He\u2019s your son, stay out of his romantic life and stop stirring the pot when you know doing that to him would upset him. Worry about your own child\u2019s feelings. Logically you have to have some understanding about how fucked it would be for you to do that to him. He just wanted you guys to meet his new girlfriend. His last relationship he could\u2019ve gone about things differently, but let him own up and heal and move on so he\u2019s happy with this new person. At what point are you going to start caring about your son\u2019s feelings in this- you already force him to feel uncomfortable as it is. Don\u2019t blame him when he ultimately separates himself from you.", "I have a hard time believing this is real because you are such the ah it's not funny. Sure what your son did wasn't nice but that has nothing to do with you. And you are now choosing this girl over your son. You're allowed to have a relationship with Heather, but don't be surprised when your son goes low or no contact with you for not understanding some pretty clear and just boundaries. YTA.", "Holy crap you are WAY out of line!!  His new girlfriend may or may not see that side of your son and really it is none of her business how he acted in the past.  It'd definitely none of YOURS!  It's nice that you see Heather as a daughter and friend and invite her over, however I wonder why she accepts.  \n\nKeep this up and you won't get to meet the grandkids, either.", "YTA.  If my parents pulled something like keeping my ex around after a break up, (Especially one where marriage wasn't involved) would be grounds for IMMEDIATE no contact.  I can't imagine feeling like your parents care more for your ex than you.", "YTA...Please let your son live his life and stop meddling.", "YTA. People break up and move on. Heather needs to be downgraded to lunch with you every once in a while. If she starts dating, are you going to replace your son with her boyfriend? He\u2019s your son.

No matter how much to love Heather, perhaps your son just didn't want to marry her. Why shouldn't his friends have encouraged your son to break up with her, when it's what he wanted? Why should your son have wasted more of Heather's time if they wanted different things? That would be pretty cruel to Heather, no matter how much you care for her. You will harm your relationship with your son if you carry on this way. It's completely inappropriate to have Heather at the dinner with your son and his new gf. I doubt Heather wants to be put on display at this dinner, and why make this new gf so uncomfortable when you could wind up caring her just as much, especially if she makes your son happy. Either way, your son's romantic relationships are *his* choice and just because you love his ex doesn't mean he does, or that you get to know every detail of why they broke up. Did you ever even ask him what he saw in his future that indicated that Heather wasn't the right person for him? Without judgement? It sounds like you primarily heard Heather's version of things.

Or to ANY gathering.\n\nYour son is right\u2014you're screwing with his life in a big way by maintaining your relationship with his ex in gatherings where he's supposed to feel comfortable and safe with family. \n\nIf you want to hang out with her outside of family gatherings, that's your business, but you're choosing Heather's presence at these gatherings over your son's peace of mind. \n\nMEET HER ON YOUR OWN, NOT WITH HIM. \n\nHow hard is that to do? It SHOULD be a lot easier than tormenting your son out of your own selfishness.", "YTA. It's up to your son how much he tells her about his previous romances, it's absolutely nothing to do with you, no matter how much you like Heather. You're deliberately stirring up drama which is mean and controlling, and very spiteful. Your son has moved on, you can't stop him doing that, stop interfering in his love life, its positively creepy.", "YTA and it sounds like your son did nothing other than talk to his friends about his relationship. It\u2019s incredibly weird that you are inviting her to family events when he has made it clear he doesn\u2019t line it, don\u2019t be surprised if he stops talking to you.", "YTA and your relationship with his ex is really inappropriate. You\u2019re going to push your son away from interaction with you.\n\nAlso wanting her there during meeting his new girl is honestly disturbing as hell. Get it together.", "YTA.  And honestly this behavior would make me go no contact with my parents.  Gross.", "YTA let the past be in the past.  Yes your son acted immaturely but let it go.  It\u2019s completely awkward to be this involved with **his ex**.  You are making this awkward for everyone involved.  Do you plan to do this for years coming?  \n\nFor everyone\u2019s sake (including Heather) let her go.  She\u2019s not in his life anymore.", "Are you going to adopt Heather?\n\nListen, I know you want her to be your son's partner, but this whole thing of inviting her to every gathering is extreme.  It's your right to do so, and it's fine if you still want to be friends with her, but come on, be honest about it.\n\nYou want to force them back together.  Your son is an adult he gets to choose who he is with.\n\nYou wanting his new gf to know what happened with Heather is not your call to make.  He is your child, but he is a grown adult.\n\nYou can't play the \"I'm his mother and I'm going to punish him like a child\" card any longer.\n\nAbsolutely YTA", "YTA and a huge one at that! You don't get any say in who your son dates or who he has a relationship with. The fact that you and your husband keep inviting your son's ex around is weird and frankly if you want any relationship with your son in the future you need to distance yourself from his ex. They weren't married and didn't have kids together. While you and your husband liked her your son no longer does, so are you going to pick your son or his ex? What happens when Heather moves on with a new guy? Do you think he is going to want to visit the parents of her ex BF? She will stop visiting at some point and if you continue down this road so will your son.", "You are being a massive AH. It's great that you got along with Heather but you can't continue to put her above your son just because they didn't work out. It is crazy how much you have involved yourself in your son's love life and even crazier that you think you should introduce the ex to the new girlfriend so she can warn her. It sounds like you don't like your son at all and your attachment to Heather is unhealthy. YTA\nAre you trying to drive every other girl away hoping he settles for going back the Heather?", "YTA \nWay to show your son who you care more about.\n\n\nYou would prefer your son to be miserable just so his ex could be happy.\n\nScummy\n\nI'd be surprised if your son wants anything to do with you in the future and I'd be surprised if you see any of your future grandchildren.\n\nYour treating your son like shit and you don't care. It's all about Heather p, that's all you seem to care about you.", "YTA so you want your son to stop talk to you? because that will be the end goal if keep doing this", "YTA. It should be their decision and their Decision ONLY who meets who and when. What happened, Happened. How that is brought up and discussed is for them to decide, not you and CERTAINLY dont bring an ex into the picture with the sole intention of potentionally ruining their relationship", "YTA. Let your son live his life. It's super weird that you can't let go of your son's ex. Watch yourself, you may end up pushing him away and him going no contact.", "YTA. Listen--it's okay to be angry at your son for treating Heather badly.  It's okay to stay friends with her.  It's NOT okay to deliberately sabotage your son's current relationship.   Either he'll sabotage it himself, or he'll have learned from his previous mistakes; but either way you need to butt out.", "YTA.. Why do you care more about Heather then your own son? He wasn't happy, she didn't make him happy but you keep rubbing her in his face.. If you keep this up your son is going to  go NC or LC with you.. Is your relationship  with Heather more important than your relationship with your son?", "YTA. Your son's ex has no business being present when he introduces his new gf to you. That's.... I'm sorry to say this but, that's deranged.", "YTA.  I get that you like Heather, but your friendship with her is between you and her, it's totally inappropriate for you to try to force your son to maintain a relationship with her if he doesn't want to, I am not surprised that he cancelled a meeting where you were going to force his current partner to meet his ex.\n\nAnd honestly, you need to mind your own business about the circumstances of his breakup. You don't know the full picture, it sounds as though he wasn't happy in the relationship and planned to end it. Him getting drunk and telling her that way rather than any other is not ideal but it doesn't sound as though there is anything a new partner needs to be warned about. He got drunk and said some mean stuff 6 years ago. How long are you planning on holding onto that grudge? And if Heather went through his phone that's not exactly appropriate behaviour on her part, either. It sounds as though neither of them behaved perfectly, but  there's no reason why they can't both move on with new partners.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso - why are you inviting Heather to every family event when you know it makes your son uncomfortable? It's one thing to maintain a friendship with someone you like as a person, separate from the fact she was your son's girlfriend, but why alienate your son over it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds as though Heather hasn't moved on from the relationship and the kindest thing you could do for her may well be to accept that, stop inviting her to events when your son will be there, stop telling her his business (and no, she has no right at all to meet his new girlfriends and it's frankly bizarre that she wants to, assuming that he and she haven't remained friends since they broke up) and accept, and encourage her to accept, that he and she are never going to get back together and she should be getting on with her own life, finding new friends and if she wants, a new partner.", "YTA stay out of your sons personal business. What are you thinking inviting heather over your son and her are done so that means his family and heather are done. If you keep pushing this you are going to loose a son.", "YTA gets some goddamn friends your own age. Heather is not your daughter or your family and never will be. Move on weirdo.", "Unbelievable what a shitty parent you are. People breakup all the time and yea you might like her but it was ur sons relationship not yours. How would you feel if ur husband parents did that to you in the pass. You are only going t  pop make ur son hate you and never see you. \n\nYou are also hurting Heather. If I was ur son and you did that I would PDA the help out of my new gf so Heather would never come around again.", "YTA and in the future you'll be wondering why he doesn't come see you anymore.", "Yta. You have to let her go. Even if you disagree with how he handled it, you can't keep up this relationship with his ex. When I was in college my girlfriend and she didn't take it well. One morning, when I was home for the summer, I woke up to she and my mom gabbing over coffee. I ended up going back to my college town, as I felt that was too uncomfortable. You're going to end up pushing your son away.", "YTA. Why are you not moving on from Heather? He clearly is trying to and you're making it hard for him to with him obviously sharing his displeasures. I think it's a bit bizarre that Heather comes to holidays, birthdays and such... Maybe if they're BIG events with neighbours, friends and such gathering but otherwise it is a bit bizarre. If I was your son's new girlfriend I would not appreciate this and if I was your son I would honestly feel pretty frustrated towards you and keep my distance until you can move on from Heather.", "YTA. You\u2019re unbelievably the assholes. I\u2019m not buying this.", "YTA\n\nI get you like her... I'm still friends with the parents of an ex from 13 years ago, but no, when he met his new girlfriend I was not there. I didn't WANT to be there, either. And you insisting she should be is you publicly shaming your kid, and maybe he deserves that but YOU should not be party to it. \n\nIt's spiteful, and your son will hate you for it.", "Yta \n\nIt isn't appropriate to insist your son's ex be there to meet his gf. The fact that she's practically *insisting* she meets her is also a huge red flag. She's obviously not over him, and you're obviously not over the fact they broke up. \n\nYour actions will not only ensure that they will never get back together, but it will certainly be a factor when he (rightfully) goes no contact with you. \n\nAsk yourself if it's worth trading a relationship with your son for his ex. Better yet, ask yourself that when she eventually moves on and stops talking to you.\n\nEdit to add- the gf has the right to know what, that he was thinking about breaking up with his ex before they broke up? That he doesn't want his ex hanging around when he brings over his current gf? What horrible thing did he do that she \"has a right to know\"?", "Damn, you are entitled af. Your crappy son left her. You raised him like that. It's okay when you are friends with a nice girl, but you not getting your son go back to her, how much you are trying to sabotage his new relationship because that's what you are doing with that.", "You\u2019re not only TA, there\u2019s something wrong with you. You have an unhealthy obsession with this Heather girl. Your son broke up with her and it\u2019s a bit inappropriate to continue a relationship with her, especially since your son has moved on. The idea that you know for a FACT the new gf will meet her eventually at your doing is disturbing. If you want to continue talking to her every once in a while that\u2019s fine, but inviting her to family gatherings is highly inappropriate and honestly worrisome that you don\u2019t see why it is.", "YTA - and NO his new GF does NOT have that right and you are certainly not the person to say anything.  No one can make you stop loving Heather, but you are now choosing her over your son.  IF you want to be shut out of your sons life, and not know any potential grandchildren then keep it up.  Butt out of his life and for gods sake, do NOT invite Heather to anything that his new GF is at!", "YTA\n\nHEATHER and you are both crappy people", "YTA. It's weird that you are this involved. Why would Heather even agree to be paraded like the ghost of Christmas past for the new girlfriend?", "No not appropriate. That\u2019s your son. Let him be happy. Just because he messed up with his last girlfriend doesn\u2019t mean that his mistakes need to be brought into every one of his relationships. If he had done something heinous to the last girl, like physical assault, I might say it\u2019s warranted that YOU let them know personally, but to just randomly have his ex around, that\u2019s not normal and it will screw up any of his relationships you do this with. That\u2019s just a really weird thing to do. If your son and husband both think it is a bad choice and they are uncomfortable with it, that should be enough. Not to mention his poor girlfriend. She is probably eager to meet you and make a good impression and you\u2019re fixated on his ex girlfriend?? That would make me feel like fucking shit if I was dating your son.", "YTA this is a great way to make your son never talk to you again. Even if you like her, this is weird and as a new girlfriend, it would be a red flag", "Well you might as well keep Heather because I doubt your son will keep a relationship with you in the future, if the GF family is nice I doubt you'll ever see him again.", "YTA move on on lose your son", "You know exactly what you are trying to do.\n\nAnd you know it will have zero positive outcone- unless you are pathological. \n\nINFO: Why are you writing here?", "YTA.

Then what? New gf will leave him and He\u2019d get back together with Heather? It\u2019s not going to happen, and heather is not going to stick around once she realises this, and you\u2019ll lose both.", "YTA. It is fine to want to hold someone accountable but this is just an inappropriate idea", "YTA, she's an ex-girlfriend, not an ex-wife or mother to your frandkids. It's inappropriate to keep her intertwined with your family. Your son stated pat where he was happy and talked with his friends about leaving, but it sounds as if there was never any cheating.  People are allowed to vent and seek advice from friends.  Ultimately, he grew apart from her and ended a relationship.", "YTA. You're also a shitty mother. Be prepared to eventually get divorced when you push your bullshit too far and your husband ends up choosing his son over a girl he used to date. You're also going to lose your son. \n\nYou like Heather so much you marry her. Stop forcing your son to be around his ex. Stop being a manipulative cow over HIS relationships.

When your son stops coming around and you never get to see your possible future grandchildren, you can call Heather to come over and console you.

If this some plan to force your son back together with Heather, it's not going to work.

They were dating for 4 years, and heather was hinting at him proposing. However they broke up when my son got drunk and ranted about how much he wanted to break up with her, what he hated about her, and how she wasnt his type.\n\nHeather went through his phone, and saw messages on how he was planning to break up with her before he went on a trip with friends. He wanted to break up with her for a while, but ever did. It was his friends who convinced him. Heather broke up with him first, and she was a mess.\n\nMy husband I love heather, and after they broke up, we were disappointed in our son but we still love in. We still talk to heather, she is family to us. She comes to dinner a few times a month, and we invite her to holidays and our birthdays. My son gets upset at this, but we kept inviting her.\n\nMy son has started dating a new girl for a few months, and he wants us to meet her for the first time before he leaves to her country and meet her family. He made it clear heather was not to come.\n\nWhile i would accept that condition, I think it would be best for his new girlfriend to know how my son acted. I told my husband, and he blew up on me. Saying it wasn\u2019t appropriate, no one wants to meet an ex, and if we focus on his past he\u2019s never going to get a relationship, or give him room to change.\n\nHowever his gf is going to meet heather sometime soon anyways, we invite her to every gathering. Heather also wants to meet my sons gf.\n\nMy husband told our son, and he cancelled the meeting.\n\nSo aita? His gf has the right to know.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That he was in a long term relationship in which he was unhappy and he managed the breakup poorly?! It happens. He wasn\u2019t a monster. And *what is wrong with Heather* if she thinks such a weird attack is acceptable behavior? Why isn\u2019t she over this? \n\nLearn boundaries.", "HUGE YTA. Does your son never get to have a relationship again as punishment? I get wanting to stay close with Heather and I think that\u2019s okay, but you need to take a step back from her. Dinner several times a month is a lot. I don\u2019t have dinner with my own mom that often. You can stay close to her while taking some space from her and also being open to your son\u2019s future partners.", "YTA. What on earth goes through your head thinking it\u2019s okay.

If you want to try to keep Heather (until she gets a new BF and moves on from you) you\u2019re going to lose your son, who may never trust you again", "YTA- it\u2019s not your job to manage your sons relationships. It\u2019s not your place to manage his relationships. You aren\u2019t giving your son an opportunity to move on and have a different successful relationship. Legit, you are sabotaging your own child. If you like heather so much YOU marry her. Your son does not need to have a relationship with Heather and it\u2019s his right to not attend anything she is present at. You might consider how you are damaging your relationship with your son.", "This is weird.", "YTA Big time. So if his new gf has the right to know how terrible he was to your darling Heather, then why is Heather still hanging around? Why does she want to be reminded how bad he was to her? She can\u2019t want to get back together with such a horrible bf. Yet you insist you are going to invite her to every gathering regardless of whether your son wants to see her. There is something wrong with Heather for putting herself in this situation.\n\nSo congratulations on gaining a daughter but losing your son. You don\u2019t want him to have another gf, so what is he supposed to do? Come to family gatherings by himself while you drool over his ex? Again, he was \u201cterrible\u201d to her when they were together so much that you have to warn his new gf of his behavior. So even if he suddenly realizes Heather was the love of his life and the one who got away, she has no self respect if she would consider taking him back. He\u2019s not going to, of course, but your motives are very suspicious.

Heather too may one day decide she's spent enough time with her ex's family and she is ready to move on.

The fact that he blurted out while drunk only goes to show that he has been struggling with the decision for too long. Have you even talked to your son after break up to make sure he was ok? Or were you only worried with Heather's feelings? Do you think it's possible he didn't break up with her before because he knew you'd be disappointed?", "You can be disappointed. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to act like he\u2019s an abuser who needs to be exposed.\n\nHe isn\u2019t. It was a rough breakup. It was long term and he was young so probably his first or limited experience with ending something like this. \n\nAnd if Heather knows your plan and feels okay with it\u2026.something is very wrong with her normal-meter too. \n\nOur kids will disappoint us. But there\u2019s \u201cmy son was an abusive/unfaithful monster and women must be warned\u201d VS \u201cmy son surprised me with poor decisions and some unkindness when managing a difficult breakup\u201d. \n\nI urge you to speak with a therapist. Holding onto these feelings is abnormal and isn\u2019t serving you well.", "Have you considered that he struggled to break up with Heather because you are so emeshed with her?\n\nLady, you have a choice: your son, or Heather.\n\nA healthy person would be able to continue to have a relationship with Heather separate of your son. You're clearly not healthy.", "So you decided to maintain a friendship with his ex gf? For what? Are you saving her for him or something? What a slap in the face.", "Did you ever think it took him so long because you are creepily obsessed with his ex?", "She is not now, nor ever going to be your family.  Your son is.  If your son breaks off all contact will perfect ex gf be the one caring for you in your old age?", "Okay, so what is your son then? Trash? Something to throw away since you got yourself a \"daughter\" to play with? What you're doing is damaging your relationship with your REAL family over who? An exgf? You're sick in the head if you try pulling this \"they should meet\" stunt. Grow the fuck up. YTA.", "You\u2019re the worst I hope you know that", "Omg, a couple of days ago it was almost the same post. The only difference was that the son got married already.\n\nOP, she is the EX of your son, if you continue act like she is still the part of the family, you will lose your son. He wanted to break up, finally broke up, but nooooo, his wonderful mother is still bringing her to his life and even wants her to meet a new gf. Sounds like a nightmare to me. You have a choice to make.\n\nAnd no, exgf doesn't have to see the new gf. Also there is a chance that they will never meet each other if you don't bring them in the same room on purpose.\n\nAnd most importantly it's is not your business AT ALL to tell the new gf anything about your son's previous relationship.\n\nYTA for acting so much out of line and being so inappropriate.", "So what are you even asking ?", "She was considered family because she was your sons gf, she no longe has that connection. How do you even introduce her? \u201cOh this is my sons ex gf that he broke up with, we still keep her around because I don\u2019t respect my son\u201d", "No she's not. She's a random girl your son, WHO IS ACTUALLY YOUR FAMILY, used to date. She's not your family but you're choosing her over your family... And you're gonna end up dying alone in a hospice somewhere with no one coming to visit. Just wait till this ex gets a new relationship and gets married. She won't even think about you. See how much family she is then.", "I hope Heather is worth it because your son will go NC with you one day. \n\nJust because you love Heather doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok to invite her to family functions, and certainly those you know your son will attend. \n\nI\u2019m getting the feeling that when your son was dating Heather, he realized he was actually dating his mother. You and Heather sound a lot alike. No self respecting person would repeatedly go to an ex\u2019s family functions, including meeting the new GF. What is wrong with you and Heather?\n\nAnyway, enjoy not being invited to your son\u2019s wedding, no matter who he marries. Enjoy never knowing your future grandchildren. Enjoy your son moving away with no notice and no forwarding address. \n\nI hope Heather is worth it. \n\nYTA", "So you are willing to throw your relationship with your son away?  What you are doing will have him going no contact. You will never get to meet and grand babies because you can\u2019t let heather go.", "She is not your family.\nShe is your son\u2019s EX girlfriend and you need to accept that.", "Well, then wave goodbye to your son.", "For real though, what happens when she moves on and gets into a serious relationship. Is she still going to hang out with her ex's family, is she going to bring him along? Are her children going to be your grandchildren? Can you rely on her to care for you in your old age, or will you then cry boo hoo to the son you pushed away because your suddenly need him? I appreciate that you care for her, and especially if she doesn't have much biological family of her own. But you know there's no guarantee she will need you forever, and then you'll be left with nothing.", "You seem like the parent that\u2019s going to wonder why your son went no contact with you. Acting so innocent as to you have no idea how your relationship got so sour", "You are going to have to choose between wanting your son at these gatherings, or the random ex-GF at them. You wont get both. And remember this when he marries and starts a family of his own and *you are cut out from all of that* because you refuse to listen and learn.\n\nWhich one is more important to you, the ex or your actual son?", "I agree but I wonder if one of the reasons why her son stayed too long was his mom and her relationship with his now ex", "True  yeah Op, I apologize, he is not crappy, but the things you are doing are not.", "I agree. Part of it is that she wants to punish her son forever for how he treated his girlfriend two years ago :/\n\nPart of it is that she likely felt like Heather was the daughter she never had (I suspect) and she can't seem to let go of this fantasy. And right now, it's sort-a working (but also not), what with Heather being present for every family event and coming around so much. But it's not going to work long term. When Heather finds a life partner, she's going to have new in-laws and build a relationship with them. If Heather ever has kids, these people and Heather's parents (if alive and present) will be the grandparents. Not OP. It's unlikely her partner will want to be around his wife's ex's parents all the goddamn time. OP needs to realize this fantasy won't last forever.\n\nShe's pushing her son away but she's unlikely to gain a daughter.", "Husband and i have been together over 15 years and we've never checked each other's phones.", "I suppose it depends on the relationship, its how it works for me and my husband, and my friends their spouses", "I was gonna say the same. A open phone policy only works when consent is given by both sides for BOTH parties to do this. Not one side only. Both would need open access and that doesn't happen always hence why it's a problem", "Same here, 10 years and never once. I trust my wife.", "Okay? Other couples are in relationships where it works that they have an open relationship, go to swingers and wife/husband swap - would this be something for you? Just because it works for others doesn't mean it works for everyone else. My god, you sure about your age?", "Then you have serious trust issues and should be worrying about the state of your own relationship instead of meddling in your son\u2019s.", "This tells us all a lot right here. You have serious trust issues and you're projecting that onto your son's relationships. Stop.", "I've never gone through my husband's phone in 34 years of marriage.  Occasionally he'll ask me to check a message, but I only do it when he specifically ASKS me to.", "But not necessarily your son and his ex-GF.\n\nHe also has every right to confide in his friends that things were not working.\n\nAs a sidenote - there is no way she didn't know something was wrong. With as miserable as your son seemed to be with her, there would have 100% been signs. She chose to ignore them, along with the relationship issues. In healthy relationships, we KNOW when our partner is off. They aren't that good an actor that we can't tell."]}
