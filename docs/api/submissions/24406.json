They were dating for 4 years, and heather was hinting at him proposing. However they broke up when my son got drunk and ranted about how much he wanted to break up with her, what he hated about her, and how she wasnt his type.\n\nHeather went through his phone, and saw messages on how he was planning to break up with her before he went on a trip with friends. He wanted to break up with her for a while, but ever did. It was his friends who convinced him. Heather broke up with him first, and she was a mess.\n\nMy husband I love heather, and after they broke up, we were disappointed in our son but we still love in. We still talk to heather, she is family to us. She comes to dinner a few times a month, and we invite her to holidays and our birthdays. My son gets upset at this, but we kept inviting her.\n\nMy son has started dating a new girl for a few months, and he wants us to meet her for the first time before he leaves to her country and meet her family. He made it clear heather was not to come.\n\nWhile i would accept that condition, I think it would be best for his new girlfriend to know how my son acted. I told my husband, and he blew up on me. Saying it wasn\u2019t appropriate, no one wants to meet an ex, and if we focus on his past he\u2019s never going to get a relationship, or give him room to change.\n\nHowever his gf is going to meet heather sometime soon anyways, we invite her to every gathering. Heather also wants to meet my sons gf.\n\nMy husband told our son, and he cancelled the meeting.\n\nSo aita? His gf has the right to know.\n\n\nOkay, to explain how their break up happened;\n\nIt was a new years party, and my son got drunk and ranted to Heather about their relationship. Some of the extended family was there and listened in. Heather didn\u2019t say anything right then because he was drunk. I only heard some stuff near the end, my family told some things that was said. What I heard was just how she wasn\u2019t his type, in looks, and in personality.\n\nThey went home after that, and my son fell asleep. So heather looked through his phone. Breaking up with him after he woke up.", "created_utc": 1691768245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15oc74t/aita_for_wanting_my_sons_exgf_around_when_my_son/", "score": 1698, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why you are damaging your sons life like that???\n\nYou are a cruel person. Your son did nothing wrong. He only didn't know how to break up, also Heather INVADED HIS PRIVECY by going through his phone and you are on her side. Wtf, op?!\n\nAnd what that poor new girlfriend did so wrong for you to be willing to be upfront rude with her and making her uncomfortable? \n\nHope your son get away as possible from all of you.\n\nYou need serious therapy.

Why would she even want to be in those situations?  She needs to move on.", "WTF is wrong with you? Why are you disappointed with your son breaking up with a girl he wasn't hapy with?

YTA.", "YTA- would you have wanted to meet your husbands parents for the first time when y\u2019all were younger and have them drop the bomb that his ex would be meeting and hanging with you guys also? Come tf on. He\u2019s your son, stay out of his romantic life and stop stirring the pot when you know doing that to him would upset him. Worry about your own child\u2019s feelings. Logically you have to have some understanding about how fucked it would be for you to do that to him. He just wanted you guys to meet his new girlfriend. His last relationship he could\u2019ve gone about things differently, but let him own up and heal and move on so he\u2019s happy with this new person. At what point are you going to start caring about your son\u2019s feelings in this- you already force him to feel uncomfortable as it is. Don\u2019t blame him when he ultimately separates himself from you.", "I have a hard time believing this is real because you are such the ah it's not funny. Sure what your son did wasn't nice but that has nothing to do with you. And you are now choosing this girl over your son. You're allowed to have a relationship with Heather, but don't be surprised when your son goes low or no contact with you for not understanding some pretty clear and just boundaries. YTA.", "Holy crap you are WAY out of line!!  His new girlfriend may or may not see that side of your son and really it is none of her business how he acted in the past.  It'd definitely none of YOURS!  It's nice that you see Heather as a daughter and friend and invite her over, however I wonder why she accepts.  \n\nKeep this up and you won't get to meet the grandkids, either.", "YTA.  If my parents pulled something like keeping my ex around after a break up, (Especially one where marriage wasn't involved) would be grounds for IMMEDIATE no contact.  I can't imagine feeling like your parents care more for your ex than you.", "YTA...Please let your son live his life and stop meddling.", "YTA. People break up and move on. Heather needs to be downgraded to lunch with you every once in a while. If she starts dating, are you going to replace your son with her boyfriend? He\u2019s your son. You should support his new relationship, not sabotage it. He and Heather weren\u2019t compatible.

No matter how much you love Heather, perhaps your son just didn't want to marry her. Why shouldn't his friends have encouraged your son to break up with her, when it's what he wanted? Why should your son have wasted more of Heather's time if they wanted different things? That would be pretty cruel to Heather, no matter how much you care for her. You will harm your relationship with your son if you carry on this way. It's completely inappropriate to have Heather at the dinner with your son and his new gf. I doubt Heather wants to be put on display at this dinner, and why make this new gf so uncomfortable when you could wind up caring her just as much, especially if she makes your son happy. Either way, your son's romantic relationships are *his* choice and just because you love his ex doesn't mean he does, or that you get to know every detail of why they broke up. Did you ever even ask him what he saw in his future that indicated that Heather wasn't the right person for him? Without judgement? It sounds like you primarily heard Heather's version of things. Do better by your son, and Heather, AND whoever your son loves.", "She's going to meet Heather anyway because you invite her to every gathering?\n\nYTA for inviting her to every gathering in the first place. Or to ANY gathering.\n\nYour son is right\u2014you're screwing with his life in a big way by maintaining your relationship with his ex in gatherings where he's supposed to feel comfortable and safe with family.\n\nIf you want to hang out with her outside of family gatherings, that's your business, but you're choosing Heather's presence at these gatherings over your son's peace of mind.\n\nMEET HER ON YOUR OWN, NOT WITH HIM.\n\nHow hard is that to do? It SHOULD be a lot easier than tormenting your son out of your own selfishness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: To be clear, your son was TA in how his relationship with Heather ended.\n\nBut that doesn't justify what you're doing.\n\nIt seems like you are really mad about what he did to Heather and trying to rub his nose in it at the expense of him ever growing and becoming a better man with someone else.\n\nIt's great that your husband is sane enough to think it's a terrible idea to for you to spring an ex on the new gf with no warning at all. Given that, it's surprising that he went along with having her at gatherings in the first place, but a little sanity is better than none.", "YTA. It's up to your son how much he tells her about his previous romances, it's absolutely nothing to do with you, no matter how much you like Heather. You're deliberately stirring up drama which is mean and controlling, and very spiteful. Your son has moved on, you can't stop him doing that, stop interfering in his love life, its positively creepy.", "YTA and it sounds like your son did nothing other than talk to his friends about his relationship. It\u2019s incredibly weird that you are inviting her to family events when he has made it clear he doesn\u2019t line it, don\u2019t be surprised if he stops talking to you.", "YTA and your relationship with his ex is really inappropriate. You\u2019re going to push your son away from interaction with you.\n\nAlso wanting her there during meeting his new girl is honestly disturbing as hell. Get it together.", "YTA.  And honestly this behavior would make me go no contact with my parents.  Gross.", "YTA let the past be in the past.  Yes your son acted immaturely but let it go.  It\u2019s completely awkward to be this involved with **his ex**.  You are making this awkward for everyone involved.  Do you plan to do this for years coming?  \n\nFor everyone\u2019s sake (including Heather) let her go.  She\u2019s not in his life anymore.", "Are you going to adopt Heather?\n\nListen, I know you want her to be your son's partner, but this whole thing of inviting her to every gathering is extreme.  It's your right to do so, and it's fine if you still want to be friends with her, but come on, be honest about it.\n\nYou want to force them back together.  Your son is an adult he gets to choose who he is with.\n\nYou wanting his new gf to know what happened with Heather is not your call to make.  He is your child, but he is a grown adult.\n\nYou can't play the \"I'm his mother and I'm going to punish him like a child\" card any longer.\n\nAbsolutely YTA", "YTA and a huge one at that! You don't get any say in who your son dates or who he has a relationship with. The fact that you and your husband keep inviting your son's ex around is weird and frankly if you want any relationship with your son in the future you need to distance yourself from his ex. They weren't married and didn't have kids together. While you and your husband liked her your son no longer does, so are you going to pick your son or his ex? What happens when Heather moves on with a new guy? Do you think he is going to want to visit the parents of her ex BF? She will stop visiting at some point and if you continue down this road so will your son.", "You are being a massive AH. It's great that you got along with Heather but you can't continue to put her above your son just because they didn't work out. It is crazy how much you have involved yourself in your son's love life and even crazier that you think you should introduce the ex to the new girlfriend so she can warn her. It sounds like you don't like your son at all and your attachment to Heather is unhealthy. YTA\nAre you trying to drive every other girl away hoping he settles for going back the Heather?", "YTA \nWay to show your son who you care more about.\n\n\nYou would prefer your son to be miserable just so his ex could be happy.\n\nScummy\n\nI'd be surprised if your son wants anything to do with you in the future and I'd be surprised if you see any of your future grandchildren.\n\nYour treating your son like shit and you don't care. It's all about Heather p, that's all you seem to care about you.", "YTA so you want your son to stop talk to you? because that will be the end goal if keep doing this", "YTA. It should be their decision and their Decision ONLY who meets who and when. What happened, Happened. How that is brought up and discussed is for them to decide, not you and CERTAINLY dont bring an ex into the picture with the sole intention of potentionally ruining their relationship", "YTA. Let your son live his life. It's super weird that you can't let go of your son's ex. Watch yourself, you may end up pushing him away and him going no contact.", "YTA. Listen--it's okay to be angry at your son for treating Heather badly.  It's okay to stay friends with her.  It's NOT okay to deliberately sabotage your son's current relationship.   Either he'll sabotage it himself, or he'll have learned from his previous mistakes; but either way you need to butt out.", "YTA.. Why do you care more about Heather then your own son? He wasn't happy, she didn't make him happy but you keep rubbing her in his face.. If you keep this up your son is going to  go NC or LC with you.. Is your relationship  with Heather more important than your relationship with your son?", "YTA. Your son's ex has no business being present when he introduces his new gf to you. That's.... I'm sorry to say this but, that's deranged.", "YTA.  I get that you like Heather, but your friendship with her is between you and her, it's totally inappropriate for you to try to force your son to maintain a relationship with her if he doesn't want to, I am not surprised that he cancelled a meeting where you were going to force his current partner to meet his ex.\n\nAnd honestly, you need to mind your own business about the circumstances of his breakup. You don't know the full picture, it sounds as though he wasn't happy in the relationship and planned to end it. Him getting drunk and telling her that way rather than any other is not ideal but it doesn't sound as though there is anything a new partner needs to be warned about. He got drunk and said some mean stuff 6 years ago. How long are you planning on holding onto that grudge? And if Heather went through his phone that's not exactly appropriate behaviour on her part, either. It sounds as though neither of them behaved perfectly, but  there's no reason why they can't both move on with new partners.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso - why are you inviting Heather to every family event when you know it makes your son uncomfortable? It's one thing to maintain a friendship with someone you like as a person, separate from the fact she was your son's girlfriend, but why alienate your son over it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds as though Heather hasn't moved on from the relationship and the kindest thing you could do for her may well be to accept that, stop inviting her to events when your son will be there, stop telling her his business (and no, she has no right at all to meet his new girlfriends and it's frankly bizarre that she wants to, assuming that he and she haven't remained friends since they broke up) and accept, and encourage her to accept, that he and she are never going to get back together and she should be getting on with her own life, finding new friends and if she wants, a new partner.", "YTA stay out of your sons personal business. What are you thinking inviting heather over your son and her are done so that means his family and heather are done. If you keep pushing this you are going to loose a son.", "YTA gets some goddamn friends your own age. Heather is not your daughter or your family and never will be. Move on weirdo.", "Unbelievable what a shitty parent you are. People breakup all the time and yea you might like her but it was ur sons relationship not yours. How would you feel if ur husband parents did that to you in the pass. You are only going t  pop make ur son hate you and never see you. \n\nYou are also hurting Heather. If I was ur son and you did that I would PDA the help out of my new gf so Heather would never come around again.", "YTA and in the future you'll be wondering why he doesn't come see you anymore.", "Yta. You have to let her go. Even if you disagree with how he handled it, you can't keep up this relationship with his ex. When I was in college my girlfriend and she didn't take it well. One morning, when I was home for the summer, I woke up to she and my mom gabbing over coffee. I ended up going back to my college town, as I felt that was too uncomfortable. You're going to end up pushing your son away.", "YTA. Why are you not moving on from Heather? He clearly is trying to and you're making it hard for him to with him obviously sharing his displeasures. I think it's a bit bizarre that Heather comes to holidays, birthdays and such... Maybe if they're BIG events with neighbours, friends and such gathering but otherwise it is a bit bizarre. If I was your son's new girlfriend I would not appreciate this and if I was your son I would honestly feel pretty frustrated towards you and keep my distance until you can move on from Heather.", "YTA. You\u2019re unbelievably the assholes. I\u2019m not buying this.", "YTA\n\nI get you like her... I'm still friends with the parents of an ex from 13 years ago, but no, when he met his new girlfriend I was not there. I didn't WANT to be there, either. And you insisting she should be is you publicly shaming your kid, and maybe he deserves that but YOU should not be party to it. \n\nIt's spiteful, and your son will hate you for it.", "Yta \n\nIt isn't appropriate to insist your son's ex be there to meet his gf. The fact that she's practically *insisting* she meets her is also a huge red flag. She's obviously not over him, and you're obviously not over the fact they broke up. \n\nYour actions will not only ensure that they will never get back together, but it will certainly be a factor when he (rightfully) goes no contact with you. \n\nAsk yourself if it's worth trading a relationship with your son for his ex. Better yet, ask yourself that when she eventually moves on and stops talking to you.\n\nEdit to add- the gf has the right to know what, that he was thinking about breaking up with his ex before they broke up? That he doesn't want his ex hanging around when he brings over his current gf? What horrible thing did he do that she \"has a right to know\"?", "Damn, you are entitled af. Your crappy son left her. You raised him like that. It's okay when you are friends with a nice girl, but you not getting your son go back to her, how much you are trying to sabotage his new relationship because that's what you are doing with that.", "You\u2019re not only TA, there\u2019s something wrong with you. You have an unhealthy obsession with this Heather girl. Your son broke up with her and it\u2019s a bit inappropriate to continue a relationship with her, especially since your son has moved on. The idea that you know for a FACT the new gf will meet her eventually at your doing is disturbing. If you want to continue talking to her every once in a while that\u2019s fine, but inviting her to family gatherings is highly inappropriate and honestly worrisome that you don\u2019t see why it is.", "YTA - and NO his new GF does NOT have that right and you are certainly not the person to say anything.  No one can make you stop loving Heather, but you are now choosing her over your son.  IF you want to be shut out of your sons life, and not know any potential grandchildren then keep it up.  Butt out of his life and for gods sake, do NOT invite Heather to anything that his new GF is at!", "YTA\n\nHEATHER and you are both crappy people", "YTA. It's weird that you are this involved. Why would Heather even agree to be paraded like the ghost of Christmas past for the new girlfriend?", "No not appropriate. That\u2019s your son. Let him be happy. Just because he messed up with his last girlfriend doesn\u2019t mean that his mistakes need to be brought into every one of his relationships. If he had done something heinous to the last girl, like physical assault, I might say it\u2019s warranted that YOU let them know personally, but to just randomly have his ex around, that\u2019s not normal and it will screw up any of his relationships you do this with. That\u2019s just a really weird thing to do. If your son and husband both think it is a bad choice and they are uncomfortable with it, that should be enough. Not to mention his poor girlfriend. She is probably eager to meet you and make a good impression and you\u2019re fixated on his ex girlfriend?? That would make me feel like fucking shit if I was dating your son.", "YTA this is a great way to make your son never talk to you again. Even if you like her, this is weird and as a new girlfriend, it would be a red flag", "Well you might as well keep Heather because I doubt your son will keep a relationship with you in the future, if the GF family is nice I doubt you'll ever see him again.", "YTA move on on lose your son", "You know exactly what you are trying to do.\n\nAnd you know it will have zero positive outcone- unless you are pathological. \n\nINFO: Why are you writing here?", "YTA.

Then what? New gf will leave him and He\u2019d get back together with Heather?

It is fine to want to hold someone accountable but this is just an inappropriate idea", "YTA, she's an ex-girlfriend, not an ex-wife or mother to your frandkids. It's inappropriate to keep her intertwined with your family. Your son stated pat where he was happy and talked with his friends about leaving, but it sounds as if there was never any cheating.  People are allowed to vent and seek advice from friends.  Ultimately, he grew apart from her and ended a relationship.", "YTA. You're also a shitty mother. Be prepared to eventually get divorced when you push your bullshit too far and your husband ends up choosing his son over a girl he used to date. You're also going to lose your son. \n\nYou like Heather so much you marry her. Stop forcing your son to be around his ex. Stop being a manipulative cow over HIS relationships.

When your son stops coming around and you never get to see your possible future grandchildren, you can call Heather to come over and console you.

They were dating for 4 years, and heather was hinting at him proposing. However they broke up when my son got drunk and ranted about how much he wanted to break up with her, what he hated about her, and how she wasnt his type.\n\nHeather went through his phone, and saw messages on how he was planning to break up with her before he went on a trip with friends. He wanted to break up with her for a while, but ever did. It was his friends who convinced him. Heather broke up with him first, and she was a mess.\n\nMy husband I love heather, and after they broke up, we were disappointed in our son but we still love in. We still talk to heather, she is family to us. She comes to dinner a few times a month, and we invite her to holidays and our birthdays. My son gets upset at this, but we kept inviting her.\n\nMy son has started dating a new girl for a few months, and he wants us to meet her for the first time before he leaves to her country and meet her family. He made it clear heather was not to come.\n\nWhile i would accept that condition, I think it would be best for his new girlfriend to know how my son acted. I told my husband, and he blew up on me. Saying it wasn\u2019t appropriate, no one wants to meet an ex, and if we focus on his past he\u2019s never going to get a relationship, or give him room to change.\n\nHowever his gf is going to meet heather sometime soon anyways, we invite her to every gathering. Heather also wants to meet my sons gf.\n\nMy husband told our son, and he cancelled the meeting.\n\nSo aita? His gf has the right to know.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That he was in a long term relationship in which he was unhappy and he managed the breakup poorly?! It happens. He wasn\u2019t a monster. And *what is wrong with Heather* if she thinks such a weird attack is acceptable behavior? Why isn\u2019t she over this? \n\nLearn boundaries.", "HUGE YTA. Does your son never get to have a relationship again as punishment? I get wanting to stay close with Heather and I think that\u2019s okay, but you need to take a step back from her. Dinner several times a month is a lot. I don\u2019t have dinner with my own mom that often. You can stay close to her while taking some space from her and also being open to your son\u2019s future partners.", "YTA. What on earth goes through your head thinking it\u2019s okay.

If you want to try to keep Heather (until she gets a new BF and moves on from you) you\u2019re going to lose your son, who may never trust you again", "YTA- it\u2019s not your job to manage your sons relationships. It\u2019s not your place to manage his relationships. You aren\u2019t giving your son an opportunity to move on and have a different successful relationship. Legit, you are sabotaging your own child. If you like heather so much YOU marry her. Your son does not need to have a relationship with Heather and it\u2019s his right to not attend anything she is present at. You might consider how you are damaging your relationship with your son.", "This is weird.", "YTA Big time. So if his new gf has the right to know how terrible he was to your darling Heather, then why is Heather still hanging around? Why does she want to be reminded how bad he was to her? She can\u2019t want to get back together with such a horrible bf. Yet you insist you are going to invite her to every gathering regardless of whether your son wants to see her. There is something wrong with Heather for putting herself in this situation.\n\nSo congratulations on gaining a daughter but losing your son. You don\u2019t want him to have another gf, so what is he supposed to do? Come to family gatherings by himself while you drool over his ex? Again, he was \u201cterrible\u201d to her when they were together so much that you have to warn his new gf of his behavior. So even if he suddenly realizes Heather was the love of his life and the one who got away, she has no self respect if she would consider taking him back. He\u2019s not going to, of course, but your motives are very suspicious.

You can keep a friendship with Heather if you want to... but it shouldn't be to the detriment of your son and any future partners.  Heather too may one day decide she's spent enough time with her ex's family and she is ready to move on.  You've got to be realistic that much as you like her, she's not part of your family and the current status quo is unlikely to remain status quo forever.  \n\nYou need to back off.

When mum got off the phone she started going on about how wonderful Lisa was and how she missed her. Then a lot of other family members joined in (in front of Tess). My brother left with a really distraught Tess, then my family ridiculed them for being upset.

I'm glad your husband blew up on you!  You sound like a meddling busybody!  Stay in your own lane, and if you want to see Heather, you do that on your own time.  How uncomfortable for your poor son!  Got to be honest - I would probably want nothing to do with you just for keeping her around, but if you try messing with his new relationship, you're guaranteed to have no son at all.\n\nEdited to say that I didn't grasp the first time that he drunkenly unloaded on Heather to her face.

It's not clear who he ranted to about her while drunk (parents? friends?

Keeping Heather in their family life is incredibly inappropriate and bad boundary setting and created an even more awkward situation for all involved.", "I don't think it was to her face, I think it was in the text messages", "That's not what happened. Seems he got drunk and ranted to his friends via text, not to Heather. How does this have 500 up votes when the post is pretty clear in that", "4 years ago! Or two or however many. We all make mistakes\n\nMom needs to move on.", "Agreed", "Yup emotional incest is how some parents rely on their kids for emotional support in a way similar to that of an adult relationship. OP is more like a \"daughter I never had\" situation. She probably always wanted to have a daughter and Heather filled that role for her.", "If OP is in denial that she's the asshole after this Reddit reaction, there is no hope for the situation.", "Damn I'm sad I missed them. I would have loved to hear her double down on why she is allowed to fuck with her sons love life like this.", "I hope exgf isn't hanging around hoping to get bf back.  That ship has sailed and she really ought to be finding new friends her own age and when she is ready a new SO.", "Right? It's been long enough for him to move on and be dating someone else long enough to meet her parents in another country!!! What's so wrong with Heather that she can't move on and leave her ex's family alone???", "This reminds me so much of my mom and my brother's ex-wife. She was 100% trying to get my brother back and Mom was definitely enabling it. She finally moved on and stopped showing up to all our family events when she got into a serious relationship with another guy. But, boy howdy, that was an uncomfortable couple years of birthdays and holidays.", "I'd love to be there when his mom engineers the ex to be there with the whole family present during some event. Mom is likely to get yelled at in front of the whole family and would deserve it.", "Ding Ding Ding...I don't care about what led to the break up. The fact is that they broke up and mom is continuing a relationship she has no business keeping.", "And the fact that the exgf continues to accept these invites to dinners and holidays speaks louder than words. Exgf, move on with your life already. These are all a bunch of weirdos.", "Yes, OP worded that strangely. My take is the son \u201cgot drunk and ranted about how much he wanted to break up with her\u201d in a text to his friends. The ex then went through his phone and saw what he drunkenly texted.", ">The rest sounds like he stayed around way too long but was likely trying to make things work.\n\nReading OP's post tells me that his mother made it almost impossible for him to break up with Heather.  Like a hostage situation.  He was probably so relieved when she finally broke up with him.  Clearly, Heather has no boundaries.  OP is going to be so surprised when Son goes NC and she never sees her grandkids.  But that's ok, she'll still have Heather.", "Yeah because he was too worried about what his parents would say if he broke up with her.", "I completely agree. His mother is out of line.   I was simply responding to \"he's done nothing wrong \".", "And they both show up wearing white!!", "Yeah, because husband will be cleared out by then", "Then get even more pissed when she hardly has any interactions with her grandkids.", "Or the subject of a r/JustNoMIL post", "You can go to OPs profile and still read some of her comments. OP is a ridiculous AH!!!", "Can you link the post?", "The difference is IIRC in the other post the ex had been an active part of the family since her teens because she had a shi\\*\\*y family herself.", "I believe that 100%, he stayed with her only because of pressure from mommie dearest.   As for the ex, what woman wants to be with a man who would only be with her because the family pressured him to be.  A man who clearly does not love her.", "The fact the Ex wants to meet the new GF as well points to her being a piece of work as well.\n\nSon didn't break up with her cleanly. He's not innocent, but it's hardly worth ruining everything for him going forward. None of us are without sin when it comes to our behavior during a breakup.", "If the ex was manipulative as his mother it probably explains why his mother adores the ex over her son. Like seriously go play the Sims instead of forcing your children to live the way you want.", "This woman is so delusional that she told her husband about her most recent plot! \n\nI am team dad all the way and I hope you\u2019ll join me in praying for him lol", "Didn't even think of that, but yeah. That's why I don't recommend meddling.", "yeahhh but THIS is the amount of crazy OP is willing to share. Who knows what the mom and ex did to keep them together. They were very clearly working together against the son. Sounds like he had been trying to get away and mom or ex would guilt him into staying until he got drunk and freaked out.\n\nI'm usually the person in the comments saying we can only judge what we are given so don't make assumptions. However, this is so clearly a very small portion of the amount of meddling that the mother does, that there is no way to ignore it.", "I mean, I generally like to do it sober so I can remember it and maybe soften it a bit, but from the sounds of things he was probably being pressured into staying with her and he finally broke.\n\nMother Dearest here would never actually admit to this, but based on what we've read it'd be in the playbook she borrowed from Emily Gilmore. This whole invite your child's ex to dinner to break them up with their current partner is a copy paste Emily Gilmore maneuver.", "This crazy mother is not a reliable source for what actually happened. YTA", "Yeah, exactly. If she\u2019s been upgraded to \u201cfamily friend\u201d status it\u2019s still inappropriate to be bringing her around her own ex and his new girlfriend. Like wildly inappropriate. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think she\u2019s actually a \u201cfamily friend\u201d I think OP took a liking to her and had it in her head that she would be her son\u2019s wife someday. Now that her son broke up with her, she is upset that her son didn\u2019t stay with the girl *she* approved of. So she\u2019s *trying* to make him feel awkward and bring her around in hopes that they will get back together, and playing stupid about it like they\u2019re \u201cso close\u201d when really she just wants to pick her son\u2019s wife. Rather than caring about how he feels, obviously. \n\nBut that\u2019s just a guess.", "And what woman wants to be present when her ex introduces his new gf to his family?", "I agree, keep in mind that his mother was adding pressure to not break up.  He went off the rails a bit there true, but it was just a bad breakup.  Doesn't everybody have some kind of bad breakup in their past?", "Mother loves Heather and we already know Mother is manipulative AH.  I AHs like this tend to team up with people similar to them. So the chances are hight son was right about Heather.", "it doesn't really even say he hated her. he was rantung about things he hated about her which I think is common when a relationship has run its course.", "We know that Heather is the person who gave mom the story. Sounds like Heather and Mom love drama", "I had an aunt who dated a guy for nearly a decade. We all loved him and hoped they'd get married. Seemingly out of the blue, they separated.\n\nIt seemed odd when they broke up because they seemed amazing together and he doted on all of us nieces and nephews, my grandparents loved him etc, but several years later I learned that old boy was not the guy we all thought he was. Behind closed doors, he was a dick and my aunt essentially finally escaped.", "I\u2019ve noticed that people like to get really hung up small details of these posts and respond in a way that\u2019s \u201cthis isn\u2019t an answer to your question but Y T A for saying\u2026.\u201d", "Oh, I took it as him blowing up at Heather while drunk and that's the thing that made her go through his phone and find that he's been having those feelings for a while... Now I'm confused by the whole post.", "Heather spending so much time around his family and wanting to meet his new girlfriend rather than respecting those boundaries also feels odd to me", "I suspect the mom thing made the break up worse.  If she hadn't been so obsessed with Heather he might have been able to break up in a more respectful way.", "Yep, and then for the ex to be ok with being there to meet the new gf is, odd", "I think that's what mom wants.", "She should not be a part of \u201cthe family\u201d. Whether he did it nicely or not the son and she broke up. Mom wasn\u2019t there for the break up. Mom loves drama. Mom makes trouble mom needs therapy.", "It's cause to break up with parents, too", ">That\u2019d make me break up with the BF just on GP, good lord.\n\nI think that's OP's goal", "Heather and the mother are trying to sabotage his new relationship. They still want him to marry Heather.", "I get the vibe that Heather was toxic, OPs son finally got sick of it, broke it off, and Heather now can't actually find another man willing to be her punching bag...\n\nIf Heather was anywhere near the catch OP wants us to think she'd have dates lined up to replace her ex...but she's free enough to go to family events with her exs family?", "The ex could want to be there in order to ruin the son's relationship with the new gf", "So she can try and force him to take the ex back. This is not going to be pretty.", "100%", "Mommy liked Heather best"]}
