But looking at her,just made furious and angry. I couldn\u2019t risk her saying something that could hurt Kevin. I told her to leave, cuz she\u2019s in violation of her court order.

I was sure this would be Y.T.A.\n\nBut turning up drunk, screaming and shouting - I think you were just being a good father.\n\nNine year olds should not be exposed to that.", "NTA - if you want to see my kid you better ring the bell, ask nicely and bring a gift.\n\nAlso show up sober! It's a kidsparty not a kegger.\nYou got full custody for a reason. \nShe needs to up her game or not see her children.", "Of course, NTA. Think of how traumatizing it would have been for him to see her in the state she was in. You demonstrated protective parenting in that moment. Though I would encourage you (if you haven't already) to get your son linked to therapy. He's going to need help processing his life with a parent that struggles with addiction. If you don't, he's going to start drawing his own conclusions that will most likely include partially blaming you.", "NTA and honestly a glimpse of her in that state likely would have hurt more.  Keep being an excellent father they are lucky to have you.", "NTA. Dude, you\u2019re in a tough spot. Yes, your son desperately wants to see his mother on his birthday. But he wants to see his *mother*. Not just the woman who gave birth to him. Whether he came voice this currently or not, what he wanted to see was his mother caring enough about him to show up. Sober. Behaving normal. Dressed normally.\n\nPart of being a parent is protecting your kids. Unfortunately, he needs protecting from her. At some point maybe you can explain to him that she needs to be meeting certain standards to see her kids and that she is not meeting them. Maybe he\u2019s getting old enough that it\u2019s time to start involving him in therapy, possibly group therapy for kids.", "NTA. If she was drunk and unruly she might have traumatized him. You were protecting him. You don't want to expose your son to that.", "NTA. You are protecting your child, and his biological mother would have been in no shape to meet him. The safety and wellbeing of your children comes first. Your older kids get it. That should be confirmation enough. You're a good dad!", "NTA, the court and your eldest children both agree she\u2019s not a good person and I think you need to start listening to those voices.", "NTA.  Had she been sober, reasonable, and pleasant, maybe YWBTA.  But that wasn't the case.  You protected your son, the end.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing.  Your son didn't need to see his Mom like that.  I hope that she can get clean and eventually be the mother your kids deserve.  In the meantime, you need to help them the best you can to understand their Mom's limitations in age appropriate ways.", "NTA. It's hard to say whether it was right or wrong. Even therapists can't know for sure exactly how things will affect a child. What's worst - not being visited, or being visited by someone who's affected by drugs and alcohol, and could possibly act traumatising?\n\nI'm no therapist so I have no idea. Regardless though you didn't do it to be spiteful. You're trying your best. Maybe consider therapy for yourself and/or your kids, and ask them how they think is best to handle this in a manner that will traumatise the 9 yo the least.", "NTA \nOP you feel horrible because you love your kids and you want the best for them. Unfortunately it\u2019s sometimes the complete opposite of what their hearts long for. His pain and grief (it\u2019s not reserved for deaths) is yours too.\n\nWe all have a picture of \u201ea perfect future (event)\u201c in our mind, Kevin pictures the reunion with his mom probably as a wonderful experience, the happy ending basically. But your ex doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s able to offer that (yet). You are protecting him from being even more disappointed and hurt. Knowing a parent doesn\u2019t choose him over their addiction is deeply  disturbing, no matter how good your logical self might understand it later. You are aware of that and are doing probably your best to balance that out as much as possible. \n\nPersonally, I\u2018d write an ongoing \u201eletter\u201c to your son for his 18th birthday or a similar occasion. You can write down everything nice his mom ever did or said for/to him, including that she remembered his 9th birthday and wanted to show him that she loved him. Explain why you couldn\u2019t allow them seeing each other but still wanted him to know that part of her still loved him, that nothing was his fault. Maybe she will be sober by then and he will get his dream reunion. But until then, you\u2018re NTA if you keep him safe, physically and emotionally. Sometimes that means choosing the lesser evil.\n\n(PS I don\u2018t know if you know Clint Edwards, he has an Instagram account and wrote some books about his dad\u2019s addictions and how he tried hard to be a better dad than his dad was able to be. Maybe it\u2019s interesting for you to read about his thoughts.)", "NTA \n\nShe sounds unhinged and if your older kids are having that type of reaction to her presence, you perhaps just prevented a traumatic memory at a precious age for your son. I hope she gets better for her children.", "NTA.  You are protecting your son.  If she really wanted it to happen she could have reached out and made an arrangement with you and showed up sober.  Keep doing what you are doing and protect your kids.", "NTA. You have a lion-heart OP. You definitely did the right thing. If she had been sober, that would have been a different story.", "Imagine a child asking 100times for a delicious ice cream sandwich, finally getting one only to discover that the thing had melted, it was a sloppy mess and virtually inedible. That the person who gave it to him was careless and let it go to shit. \n\nThat\u2019s what you protected him from. He has an image of mom in his mind and it would have been shattered\u2026.. utterly\u2026\u2026and on his birthday nonetheless. Your instincts that said he\u2019s too young for that are spot-on. \n\nNTA. You did right.", "NTA she needs to get control of her life. If she wanted to see him she should have made proper arrangements and not been out drinking prior.  He'll understand when he gets older.", "NTA. It hurt I know but you still did what was right.", "NTA. Ex addict here and you are super NTA. You have to protect your child even if you are the bad guy in their eyes for a minute. She was drunk, inappropriate and with an unknown person. I would be tearing you a new one if you had entertained that scenario. I respect the hell out of you because this scenario is hard work and heartbreaking for all.", "NTA. Your job is to protect your children. They may not understand but that\u2019s why we have the tough job of raising them.", "NTA. Sorry your kids are going through this but glad they have you.", "NTA, but this may be an unwinnable battle for you.  You are doing the right thing, but young children (and plenty of supposed adults) often love toxic people.  Sarah's absence from Kevin's life makes it easy for him to overlook her obvious flaws as a parent.  I think that you should allow some contact if your ex can sober up, but never leave her alone with Kevin.  Just be prepared for Kevin to develop a fantasy about the perfect life that he would have with his perfect mother.  Sometimes you just need to do your best for your children without any reward or acknowledgement.\n\nBoth of your other 2 children agree that Sarah should be kept away from the family.  They have the best understanding of the situation.  Trust their opinion.", "NTA. However he clearly wanted to meet his mom, so it would've been ideal if you had called her before the birthday and asked her to come sober, and explained that you wouldn't let her in otherwise.", "Edit NTA you protected him from her. She wasn't in a state that he should see her in. Seeing his mom like that could have been even worse than his disappointment. If she makes the right steps and cleans herself up. Let him see her if the court agrees the steps have been taken. The court is an impartial body that can look at her state with out emotions getting involved. There is a reason you have full custody.

He will understand later on when he's a little older, but right now he'd be torn or mad, at both of ya.  \n\ntime and discussion will help.", "NTA. Good for you with the way you handled it.", "NTA. this is tough. I feel so bad for your kids.", "NTA, she made the choice for you when she came to see him messed up. She could have very easily called before taking whatever she took to wish him a happy birthday but she chose alcohol/drugs over her kids.", "NTA, he wouldn't have wanted to see his mom like that. My life coach said to a kid, the parents are their angels and it pains them when the parents are in pain. Your older kids are correct in protecting their younger brother. It sucks, it hurts but OP's son probably should enjoy being a kid a little bit longer before he learns the truth about his mom.", "I swear I already read this from the wife's perspective. It did not go well for her in that version events either.", "NTA in the slightest. You're protecting your child, and you didn't lie \u2014 she's not well. Make sure you document what happened, including a sentence or two in writing from your gatekeeper. (A timestamped email would do.)\n\nWhether or not you engage with your ex about this later on depends on whether you think she's receptive to change. Given that you have full custody, clearly the court didn't think she is ready, and your older kids, who clearly understand what's going on, agree. A glimpse of Kevin's mother in that condition probably would have been worse than not seeing her at all.\n\nThe best birthday gift you can give Kevin is support and the chance to talk to someone about his feelings. He's ready for counseling, and it's important for you to let him know it's always ok to talk about it when he misses his mom.", "NTA.\n\nI don't fault you in any way for your choice. But even though she might have made a scene and might have been in awful in a hundred ways, there's also something for a kid in knowing their parent tried to see them them, even if they're crazy.\n\nIt's hard to know in those moments what is the more traumatic option for a kid. You made the call that made sense in the moment. Definitely NTA.", "NTA, seeing his mom in that state could have been worse than her not being there. Both situations suck, but I don\u2019t think you did the wrong thing.", "NTA - unless there's more to the story here that you're not telling us, mom is a  trainwreck right now and things would not have gone well.", "NTA. Seems like the meeting would not have gone well.", "NTA. Just think about the kind of door you're opening if you allow them to be in contact while she is still clearly not sober. Because you know it doesnt end on a birthday greeting.", "NTA. The Mom he wanted to see was not the Mom who showed up. It is heartbreaking, but if her addiction is still in control, she can't be the Mom he wants.", "You did good dad.\n\nIm sorry that it hurts man. We never want to see the smalls hurt in the heart like that, gotta protect the kids tho. Sounds like she was being beligerant, couldnt even sober up to see her kid, fckin gross.", "Man, that\u2019s a tough one on everyone. You, the kid and even her. As sick as she is with her addictions, she does still love him in her own twisted way. \n\nI had a similar situation with my oldest. His mom signed him away, and my wife adopted him. But she would show up about once a year with a car full of presents and guilt. \n\nAnd he absolutely pined for her. But anytime I let her see him, it just made things worse. His behavior would go off the rails for a few months and just as thing were settling back down, she\u2019d show up and blow things up again.\n\nYou are definitely NTA here.\n\nAt some point, the kid has to see the truth for himself. 9 years old is probably too young for that, but it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s probably a good idea to get some professional help with that.", "NTA I think it is best to follow the court order. It makes it meaningless and looks bad to the judge if you allow it to be broken.", "Telling your son his mom isn\u2019t well is an extremely kind way to handle the situation. Perhaps you can sit him down and say that his mom needs to get better before she can see him but that you are hoping she gets better too.", "NTA.  You need to protect your kid.  Nothing good would have come from that.", "Get your custody order to mandate supervised visits with the mother if it isn't already set up that way.   My suggestion would be to have her meet a court-appointed advocate somewhere and, if she is sober and acting right, calls you to bring the child(ren) and stays until the visit is concluded.  A third party observing won't have the same drama potential and avoid any possible conflict in front of the kid(s).  You absolutely did the right thing by turning her away.  NTA.", "NTA she was in no state to see him. its better he didnt see her than see her like that", "NTA\n\nHe wanted to see his mum, not a drunk addict who was off her proverbial face. That helps no one. Better to be told she was unwell than couldn't turn up sober on his birthday.", "NTA.  I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s awful.", "NTA and you\u2019re a good dad", "I'm just gonna leave my piece here\n\nJust because your son wants to see his mom it doesn't mean he should, there's a reason parental rights are sometimes taken. Does this situation equal that response? I don't know since I don't know just from this interaction if she's an alcoholic or nor, or how responsible she tends to be.\n\nI'm saying it so you know that when you don't let your inebriated ex crash your kids party, you are not making the wrong choice, being a parent is about protecting, guiding and nurturing; with love, respect and firmness when needed, the life you created.\n\nYou just took a decision based on what's best for your son, your son doesn't need someone that will come and go from his life, he needs someone to have his back and protect him from just that.\n\nPlease, keep it up even if it hurts you to see him sad. Cause if you hadn't, he'd be all sorts of worse thanks to his mother.", "This is such a great comment. OP is absolutely NTA. \n\nHe did the right thing protecting his son.", "I think you have a typo. Did you mean NTA?", "I think you mean NTA", "Yes I edited it. I messed up.", "Shit yes I did!!!! Editing now."]}
