Your dad should be allowed as much of a say as her. Sure most men prefer to let the woman get on with it, but that doesn't make it any less about him.\n\nIf she is so stubborn, talk to your dad.

That would probably be even more special because you will be there for him :)", "NTA\n\nHonestly your soon to be stepmother sounds batshit crazy.

But I honestly think where there's kids involved, it's thoughtful to include them as a sign of being happy to now be officially family.\n\nYour dad could include you on his side as a groomswoman,  but it doesn't feel the same to me. It doesn't feel like she wants to acknowledge that your dad has kids that aren't hers. \n\nIt sounds like you generally have a good relationship with her, so hopefully she will apologise once she's calmed down and thought about it.

She is being a crazy person,  if she can\u2019t have her soon to be step daughter as a bridesmaid, and she sounds jealous of you and your dads relationship how will this play out after the wedding.   Maybe she is just pretending to be a great person to you to hook your dad and will change how she treats you after the wedding.  \nSeriously how is having you as a bridesmaid making anything about you?

So, your Dad is an asshole. \n\nThat said, Your ASM is a piece of work. The words she used, and certainly getting in *your* face about it, don't remotely put her in a good light here, and certainly the latter makes her an asshole. \n\nYou, on the other hand, are barely involved.

Your stepmom had a freak out (reasonably) when she found out, and while she put it badly, she has a point that the wedding is not about you, OP.  \n\nIf your dad wants you in the wedding, he can make you a groomsman or an usher or something.  For him to offer you a bridesmaid spot without his fianc\u00e9\u2019s permission was the real mistake here.", "NTA\n\nSounds like this mess is a situation caused by your Dad's assumptions, and dated ideas that women have to be on the women's side of the aisle. He could have just as easily given you a groomsperson position. \n\nBut he's got his mates for that, right? \n\nHe clearly didn't run you being a bridesmaid past her before he talked to you about it, and while she sounds *just delightful*, the bridesmaids are her choice and she probably picked people out already.", "YTA its her day she should be by herself without you or your dad obvoiusly you would take away from her glory lol. but seriously your dad should not get married to this women NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
