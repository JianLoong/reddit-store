What if you just start leaving him alone with the kids? Just as soon as he gets home you say alright your turn and just leave?", "NTA but I\u2019d change the plans. Tell him you\u2019re sorry and call and cancel the daycare. Get up before everyone else and leave him with the kids for the day. Turn your phone off and take a drive to a nice location and spend the day alone. Then when he goes off at you about it, tell him \u201cdon\u2019t you love your kids? You should want to spend your days off with them!\u201d", "NTA\n\nYou should get some counseling (together) if you want to try to stay together", "NTA of course and he is a huge one for not listening and assuming he knew better. What a dick.", "Next time he goes to the bathroom for an hour, open the door & send all 3 kids on there with him.  He shouldn\u2019t mind since he loves his children.", "Dear OP, before filing for divorceor even hinting about it, hide his passport. Tell your lawyer about what he said about leaving country and discuss how to make him stay and pay.", "ETA. Sorry. I can barely read this because it gives me ptsd about my own marriage issues when my kids were little. I've been through all that.. where everything seems hopeless and you just don't care about your husband anymore (and he clearly doesn't care about you). I didn't care if my marriage failed (maybe even wanted it to) because I just didn't see any way for it to work. You may not care either, but if you think it is hard being married to an unsupportive, emotionally distant husband, imagine sharing custody with an unsupportive, emotionally distant ex-husband (and eventually some random \"stepmom\" trying to compete with you). It will be a whole new kind of hell! \n\nFor your own sake (and for your kids sakes) you have to start seeing eye to eye with your husband and start supporting each other. I know this might not be what you want to hear (it's so much easier to listen to those who are validating your feelings and telling you what a loser your husband is, what a waste of time and how you're not getting anything from this marriage), but that is not in your best interest. You didn't marry him to have a couple of kids and get divorced, you wanted it to work, and so you have to work on it to make it work!\n\nWhat saved my marriage was one simple change. It's the last thing you feel like doing, and you may have to force yourself to do it (even if it's insincere at first) but I promise you it will change everything. What you have to do is change your attitude. Easier said than done, but your attitude really is a choice. Change it to one of gratitude and your whole world will be better.\n\nI heard you say your husband is a good dad (if only for 3 hours of the day), so start with that. Write a list of all the reasons you appreciate your husband (and resist the urge to write a list of all his negative traits). Think about all the reasons you married him, everything he does for your family and kids, think of how your kids faces light up when they see him, etc. \n\nOn the reverse side, when you talk to your friends about their marriage problems or read horror stories online about truly bad husbands (abusive, deadbeat, unfaithful, killers, etc.) remind yourself that you are lucky that you don't have things THAT bad (of course if he actually is an abusive, unfaithful, deadbeat, killer .... LEAVE, but I'm writing this with the assumption that you just have normal marriage problems). I'm not saying don't have limits, I'm just saying start focusing on the good stuff for a change and see how your perspective shifts. Show your appreciation when you do see something good he does. Thank him for bathing the kids. Post the reasons you appreciate him online (for the world to see) on your anniversary. He will notice. \n\nWhat you are doing is being the kind of spouse that you need. When you show him that kind of hope for your relationship, he will give it back and show you that he supports you and cares for you too. He is feeling as isolated as you are feeling, and one of you needs to be the first to reach out and break the cycle of emotional isolation. Don't play the blame game, who distanced themself first ... it doesn't matter. All you can do is control how you look at things and how you act, but by doing that, you will undoubtedly have a positive effect on his behavior too and possibly save your marriage. It worked for me. \n\nSorry for the long post. I hope this helps someone who reads it.", "NTA - Seems like you married a baffoon who just expects you to pop out kids and do all the housework like a 50's wife. Fuck that.

But my parents and siblings all work full time and are busy on weekends plus  weekends are the only time he really sees the kids so we don\u2019t leave them with my parents.

You said in another comment that the only time he's ever been alone with them is when you were in the HOSPITAL and even then you left without medical treatment because he couldn't handle it.\n\nWake up, he's not a good dad.

They are watching *very* closely, and will pick up on the power dynamics in your household - they have to, in order to figure out where they fit into it.

They\u2019ll notice who bounces back quickly from an argument, and who\u2019s left feeling confused and defeated for days afterwards.

You don\u2019t have to decide you\u2019re leaving but no matter what you ever want to do that will give you concrete information about your rights and constraints so you can think about it knowing what\u2019s likely.
