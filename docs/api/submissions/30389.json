This may sound bad but I asked him to cancel it and his work leave and do nothing because what I had originally asked him to do was take the day off to look after our 11 month old for a half the day while our 2.5year old is at day care and I can get some time off to just sit and watch TV and have a nap and just get some rest.\nI haven\u2019t had a break from the kids in over a year and just wanted to relax then we could do something when we pick up 2.5year old. Instead my husband books a lunch wants 2.5 year old to stay home for day care to come with us. When I told him I didn\u2019t want that he started saying, they are your kids don\u2019t you love them, don\u2019t you want to spend your birthday with them. I love my kids but it will mean I have to make them all breakfast, manage the kids while my husband goes to the toilet for an hour in the morning, then he will decide he needs to do some task before lunch that will give me no time to get ready because i\u2019m alone with the kids, I have to pack all their bags and manage them while we are at lunch and it will just be like another day.\nMy husband always half asses things then blames it on me or something else, we got married in Covid and had a small wedding that my mum and I planned everything he hardly helped, we didn\u2019t go on a honeymoon and 3 years later still haven\u2019t, my last couple of birthdays he doesn\u2019t get a cake or sing Happy birthday or take any photos of me and the kids. Last year I was 35 weeks pregnant and he organised his friends who I don\u2019t get along with to come over at midnight and all they do is speak their language that I can\u2019t speak and I say by myself to the side while they all talked. \nI asked him if he told the daycare our child will be off tomorrow he said no you do it. I told him I didn\u2019t organise this lunch so don\u2019t worry just send him and cancel it. After telling him to cancel the plans he went off on me telling me to leave him alone, he can\u2019t do this anymore and doesn\u2019t want me to talk to him anymore. My response was not nice and I told him to F off and we got in a big fight.\nSo AITA for asking my husband to cancel the lunch he booked for my birthday which I didn\u2019t even want to do in the first place.", "created_utc": 1699224440, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17oo0hs/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_cancel_all_the/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's literally \\*your\\* birthday. I find it kinda messed up that you asked him to watch your youngest so you could take a breather, and he flat out did not listen to you. I know you said your response was not nice, but I'm a strong believer in you get what you give, and if he got angry at you because \\*he\\* didn't listen to you, I think you deserve to get angry and yell at him. I would be more worried that he seems like he doesn't want to be alone with the kids? Maybe he thinks he's above taking care of them, maybe he doesn't know how, either one is concerning.", "Oh, no way. NTA completely. Every Mother's Day when my three kids were little consisted of my husband taking ALL THREE OF THEM somewhere for 4 or 5 hours to give me a break. And there were plenty of non-special-occasion weekends that he did that as well. \n\nYou deserve a partner who cares about you and listens to your needs.", "NTA. But you don\u2019t have to stand idly by. Let him take the day off. Keep the kid home from daycare. But wake up early and just leave him with the kids. Book a spa appointment. Let him know you can meet him for lunch and he can get the kids ready and you\u2019ll be waiting. And if he objects, ask him, don\u2019t you love your kids?  Don\u2019t you want to spend your day off with them?", "NTA\n\nOh, honey... You deserve a break like any other person. Your husband, hand to God, sucks a bag of dicks. Send the little one to day care. Skip the lunch if that's what you want. It's not too much to ask to spend a few hours out of one day the way you want to. Nap until you can't nap anymore.", "Oh no no no no no honey. You are NTA at all and your husband is a huge AH. I can *feel* your exhaustion through what you wrote. You need a break, you expressed that to your husband and all he did was berate you and try to tell you you don't love your children? Oh no no no. Genuine question: What exactly does this man bring to your life and your relationship? What does he bring to your kids' lives? Because it honestly doesn't sound like he brings a whole lot more to you and your kids' lives than more work.", "NTA. \n\n\nYou told him the birthday gift you wanted. He decided to do something different. You declined. Nothing wrong with that. \n\nIt seems like he needs to be more involved overall as a parent TBH.", "NTA your husband sounds like a terrible partner.", "NTA \n\nYou picked a Dud. Return him.", "NTA.  If you want to stay with this person (I am not going to call him a husband or a father because he isn't behaving like one), counseling is in order.", "NTA.\n\nFirst, Happy Birthday! Second, you're not in the wrong for needing to step away. Don't feel bad. But does sound like the marriage has run its course. The red flags were flying way before.", "NTA \n\nNeeding a break doesn't mean you don't love your kids. It sounds like your husband only experiences the fun parts of having kids because you do all the work. \n\nI'm sorry that you don't get to celebrate your birthday the way you wanted. I hope you still have a happy birthday.", "NTA. It's so simple - just do what you asked. It wasn't elaborate or expensive or difficult.", "NTA\n\n>My husband always half asses things then blames it on me or something else, we got married...\n\nBut you already know that. And now you need to decide if this is all you deserve.", "Here\u2019s what I think. You could do two things for your birthday. Ask him to attend marriage counseling with you two days a week or ask him for a divorce. I have 4 kids and I know just what you\u2019re going through. My spouse isn\u2019t good about plans either. But not getting you a cake? Not wishing you happy birthday? Accusing you of not loving your kids because you\u2019re burnt out? From your description he does no parenting. I\u2019m a SAHM and many husbands think they have a free pass to never be a parent because the go to work but that\u2019s not the case and never should be. Counseling or divorce. Happy birthday I\u2019m sorry NTA", "Absolutely not! If they are trying to celebrate your day and you don't want to then that's how they should celebrate it.

But I have to admit I would have pretended to go along with his plans, left the 11mth old at home with him while dopping the 2.5yr old at day care, then kept going to that spa appointment you made for yourself or to the brunch you organised with your friends to take that break you really need, or if you need sleep, ask a friend if you can sleep in their spare room for a few hours.  Then when you pick up the 2.5yr old from day care, you go home feeling a little more human again.\n\nAlthough, you do realise as another person said, you will get more time to yourself as a single parent.", "NTA at all.  He sounds like he doesn't understand your needs.  You have outlined them in a very eloquent post here, but did you say all this stuff to him or do you just expect him to know it?  If you haven't outlined it to him the way you have here then you need to work on communicating your needs to him so he can accommodate.  If you have done that, then you have bigger problems because then it would appear that he is ignoring them.  Either way, I think you might be prime for couple's counseling.", "You have a shitty husband. Please do not have any more children with him", "NTA. He's manipulating you into feeling bad that you don't want to spend time with your kids. Some people don't believe women are people after becoming mothers.", "NTA at ALL!! You deserve better than this treatment (and I'm not talking only about your bdays...).

Get a manicure, take an exercise class, meet a friend for coffee once a week. Tell him it\u2019s up to him to mind the children and house while you are gone.

It will not get better on its own.\n\nI tried for 20 years. I will still be beaten down by him if he had not died.", "I know people jump on the divorce/break up train.. but what the actual f*ck do you get out of this relationship?

Lunch and a full day of taking care of the kids is not a present. You should try to gift him the same come his birthday and see how delighted he is.", "NTA. \n\nYou asked for a much needed break, and your husband isn't willing to give it to you because it means him having to do something to make it happen. \n\nIf there's a next time, do yourself a favor. Let him take the day off, and you spend it at a hotel or spa and get your break.", "Nope, definitely NTA. He\u2019s completely ignoring you and your wishes for your birthday and disregarding your feelings. He\u2019s not truly listening to you when you say your need an *actual break* from the kids.

Hope it gets better than this!", "NTA-He's just too lazy to take care of the kids by himself. That's why he didn't listen to you.

Why are so many men like this?!", "When the 7th Harry Potter book came out close to my birthday, I asked my partner that all I want is a whole day to myself so I can read the book.

Thank him for the birthday present of time to yourself. \n\nNTA", "Nta. Everyone needs a break from their kids at some point. Having a day to yourself is a great bday present and your husband is a complete tool for not going along with it", "This! Is he ever alone with both kids while you go get your hair done, manicure? Movies, drinks with friends?", "Wake up, get the toddler prepper for daycare, drop off the toddler, go to your parents, take a shower, go out to lunch with Mom or on your own. Get a pedi or something that makes your heart happy.

Changes nappies, feeds them, showers them but that is only 3 hours of the day the rest is up to me and on weekends he does minimal as well as we are always on the go. He doesn\u2019t care about me, doesn\u2019t care if I need to get ready and take a shower, that we need to leave at a certain time he needs to do things his way. This is another example of how it needs to be his way and it has been the same every other year. Two years of our marriage I was pregnant on my birthday and one I organised a trip away with my parents and him, I booked everything and my parents paid for lunch and dinner", "This!", "This is ridiculous.  The marriage has run it's course.  Get real.  This is a fight/argument/communication issue and is NOT a reason to get divorced.  If it constantly happens and one or the other is unwilling to change, another story.  This doesn't sound like that... yet.", "i wish but he always says to me if we get divorced he will leave back to his home country with his mum and quit his job and the courts can find him for child support.

In Australia a Departure Prohibition Order prevents someone with a child support debt from leaving the country.  You should make some calls and get advice on what your options are.", "Oh dear, please seek professional marriage counseling and make sure you go out by yourself one night a week from here on out no matter what he says. Go to the movies alone, or to drinks with friends or to a nice cafe with your laptop to just veg. Do not let him gaslight you or berate you or bully you into not doing it. You need it. Period. I\u2019m a stay at home mom of 4 kids under 7yo. Every week I have at least one night of book club, or movie or drinks.
