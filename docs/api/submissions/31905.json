Continuous barking means she\u2019s on the trampoline and can\u2019t get off", "I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted for shit for saying this, but I always find it somewhat ironic the sort of moral outrage at things like shock collars when we live in a meat eating society. \n\nIt\u2019s like, you can shoot an animal for fun, then there\u2019s horrifically brutal conditions which exist for livestock so people can eat an abundance of meat but god forbid you put a shock collar on a cute little dog so someone can sleep. \n\nJust complete moral hypocrisy imo, and I\u2019m not even vegan.", "We have a shock collar but we only use sound or vibration. Never shock\u2026 because that is inhumane", "My daughter took her dog to training for a year. She worked hard with him. He was wild and just didn't want to do what he was supposed to. The trainer finally told her to get a shock collar. She only had to shock him once, after that the warning click worked. But the battery ran out, she took the collar off for a couple of hours, opened the front door and he bolted, knocking her off her feet. She lived on a busy highway and he was literally cut in half by an 18 wheeler.

Citronella ones, yes.", "I feel the same.", "Honestly, the dog doesn\u2019t get enough exercise.  Between my girl working and going to school (she also works 12hr shifts) and I don\u2019t live there, so I don\u2019t see her everyday, I don\u2019t get to do all the extra stuff all the time. I did tell her whole family that the dog needs extra exercise and attention. My girl does do what she can, as the dog was pushed on her like every other responsibility in that household. Her sister, nor anyone else does much of anything. Ofc not an excuse, but her sister should have left the dog alone if she wasn\u2019t going to take care of it in the first place\n\nAlso want to add, that when we move into our own place, there would be a lot of opportunity for her to exert herself. Especially because I\u2019m the \u201cfun dad\u201d. I\u2019m just hoping stuff doesn\u2019t get out of control when she is 3 or 4", "That\u2019s what I want!!!  Right here!!!!", "Of course you are not giving her an ultimatum! If something, you are giving her the chance of moving on before you get even more involved in eachothers lives. \n\nYou want to be happy and well-rested, and you deserve to be. \n\nShe wants to hitch her wagon to someone who is more accepting of barking dogs. \n\nIn my mind, you don't sound compatible, given that you see this situation in such different lights. \n\nAn option is that you could try and work it out together, like you so nicely suggested with the training. The fact that your GF refused says a lot about her, and absolutely nothing about you. You tried to solve the situation, and she couldn't even be bothered to try.\n\nI don't know how long you've been together, but like I said before, you are well within your rights to prioritize your own mental health and happiness over someone else's, and it does NOT make you an asshole. Especially not if the other party isn't pulling their weight in trying to make the relationship work. \n\nAnd not to be 'that guy', but if you can't work out an issue like this between you, what will happen down the road when you inevitably come across a bigger problem?\n\nFor clarity, 100000% NTA.", "Haha I have 2 so I don\u2019t blame you! They grow up though but give you other types of problems. Still love them to bits. Maybe that\u2019s what dog owners feel too!", "It was cool at first. The puppy at the time, was 7 weeks old. Mainly just a biter at first. This barking stuff is relatively new in the last 10 months and has gotten progressively worse. But I agree, communication was off.

Which is another one of my pet peeves.\n\nETA: I suggested more training after I found out the breed (Korean Jindo), but the sister didn\u2019t want to pay for them or train her either, my GF was extremely busy with work and so was I. But in my free time I would train her. The problem is, the sister wouldn\u2019t keep up with the training or anything remotely close to it some time back\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.

I still got another year or 2 before we save up and move in together officially. I don\u2019t want her to be anxious because that\u2019s not healthy or a way to live.

Unfortunately we are having absolutely no luck.   \n\nWe did have a dog (Newfoundland, Rotti, and Australian shepherd) who was a barker.  We got a trainer for her but no matter what she barked a lot.  We tried everything and nothing worked.", "Congrats on the exam. Now this type of situation is a bit complicated and not for a stranger to give suggestions. But if i were in your shoes i would probably tell her about the situation and break it down for her. For example the conversation could be something like this:\n\nYou know how dog barks at night and keeps me from sleeping. This is a problem for me as i get close to non sleep. We need to fix this, if this goes on i won't be able to keep this up as i am getting exhausted. \n\nNah, i can't train her.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily have to be you, we can look for an educated professional and get his/her help.\n\nOk (Great, problem is solved)\nNope (We continue)\n\nI am sorry but if that's the case i can't be sharing the home with you and can't be spending time with you as much i would like to.\n\nIf she still insist on not training her dog, then it's time for maybe not staying with her or maybe breaking up or etc.\n\nThat sure was a weird entry by me, sorry for it was a bit awkward. Tried my best and sorry for my bad england lol.", "How, please. I have a husky mix and we can't even open our blinds out shell bark at leaves.

If they used to shock collar once or twice they'd never have to use it a 3rd time.", "I just googled cuz I wasn't too sure, but most seen to indicate dogs are ok to eat cooked corn. One said can't eat too much cuz might cause blockage.  But I think a lot of common dog food brands use corn as fillers in their dog food.  I don't feed my dogs those brands though.  Unfortunately they are buying up all the good smaller brands."]}
