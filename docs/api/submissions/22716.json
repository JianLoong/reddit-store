Imo, you can get firmer and just tell them to take you out of rotation or when your turn come around, you can bring in hummus and veggies (which may motivate them to take you out of rotation anyway) or an air popper and couple bags of kernels.", "Maybe OP should maliciously comply by bringing in something they like - they said they\u2019re trying to lose weight, perhaps some beans and brown rice? Banana ice cream? Homemade oat protein shakes? \n\nNot that they should have to. Just to drive the point home that their officemates are being selfish.", "Even if I was okay with buying them something, personally I would not want to buy sweets because that's not what I want to bring to the world.", "I wouldn't even be annoyed if someone ate the treats but didn't bring any.", "My understanding that in the UK all they have to provide is water", "Lol that would be nice but I think offices are only required to provide access to clean water.", "OP is British so in this instance sweets are what Americans call candy.", "From first hand experience the sugar free sweets from Holland and Barrett have a very strong laxative effect. I won't make that mistake again.", "For some people, that's not necessarily a bad thing. I'm not at work to socialize or make friends. I'm here to make money so I can socialize with my friends outside of work. I would give ANYTHING to just be left alone at work, lol.", "Totally valid position! I would keep in mind that bringing donuts doesn't get you a promotion, it makes the social resistance to managing/moving past peers less problematic. So could being a charismatic person, etc.\n\nUnless you work in a black box totally detached for peers and supervisors, social engineering will always be a part of promotion in some capacity. Working hard and being the best at what you do doesn't gain most companies anything if they promote you. They gain the most by keeping you where you are and extracting as much value as they can out of you. The reward of hard work is typically more hard work. The reward of politics is promotion. It shouldn't be that way, but it typically is in most places.\n\nDonuts are not the path to the c suite, but they can be part of a strategy to get there.", "Even more AH in that case. Not your food, maybe someone else would like to take it home for their family.\n\nHonestly either contribute sometimes, or don't partake at all", "Meh. That\u2019s a part of life though. If they don\u2019t like you, you don\u2019t get the gig. It\u2019s silly but true.", "and that's when you start SOBBING in the office while telling an elaborate story about how your grandma died on your birthday because she choked on your birthday cake.", "Urgh. I once worked somewhere that they had a tea club and everyone paid a monthly sum for tea/coffee/toast.\n\nThey kept pressuring me to join despite not liking coffee and being allergic to bread. \n\nApparently me refusing pushed others into dropping out too.", "The way. I take my birthday off every year. To avoid exactly this.", "[removed]", "Bringing food to work is voluntarily done, never an obligation.", "I like your thinking!!", "Bot", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154lscr/comment/jspi9fh/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "How do you make sugar-free toffee? Isn't sugar a main ingredient?", "You're borderline diabetic controlled by diet. That's all you should have to say.", "One place I worked was getting free coffee from a student\u2019s mom every few months because she got it free from her work. When that student graduated we all realized we\u2019d have to start paying for coffee again and our office manager did the math that it would be about 50\u00a5 per cup to buy the same stuff we had been drinking so we put a jar on the counter and started putting in money per cup. It was an okay system but a hassle to remember to bring change to the kitchen.", "Ok calm down Satan", "This is the best approach. OP should say he watched his grandmother choke on a cupcake and now sweets give them panic attacks. Then sob. Hard.", "NTA. My old office was like this too and the entitlement was disgusting.", "...~~pushed others into dropping out~~...\n\n...gave others the courage to decline to participate...  \n\n\nFTFY", "Me too.", "Bot comment stolen from LuckyBanana15 right under this, downvote and report", "Nasty would be changing the packaging so they don't know it's sugar free.\n\nDiabolical would be including some THC infused ones.", "It is recognised by most as a great perk. But still complaints and some people do have own machines /filter methods. Not everyone likes blend. However central London with a lot of tourist cafes and few food shops nearby.
