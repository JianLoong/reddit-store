God I hate offices like this. Where there is some sort of \u201cenforced family/friend\u201d thing.", "NTA - In the UK, most companies are too tight to provide tea and coffee for free so everyone in the office usually throws a pound a week into the tea/coffee collection and we buy our own. We'd never expect anyone to a pound in if they didn't drink tea/coffee. I don't see your situation as being any different. Stay strong and save your money for peaches or apples :)\n\nAlso, I've not lived in the UK for 7 years so it might have gone up now. Don't come at me because I didn't adjust for inflation haha.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t agree to participate so you shouldn\u2019t have to bring any sweets. If they still keep bugging you about it, then you could try bringing fruit snacks since they are healthy so you can have some and it can also be sweet (depending on the fruit you choose).", "NTA but just take candy when they bring it, put it in a drawer, and when it's your turn, put that out. All problems solved.", "NTA they should be expecting you to partake if you don't eat the sweets.  Just ask to be taken out of the rota because you don't eat sweets.", "NTA. Bringing food to work is voluntarily done, never an obligation.", "NTA. My old office was like this too and the entitlement was disgusting. The bitching reached peak levels when the diabetic lady brought in home made sugar free toffee so she could also partake for once.", "NTA\n\nThey know you don't join in with this \"tradition\" so they should plan accordingly.", "NTA\n\nI don't drink coffee and I refuse to subsidize my co-workers' coffee addiction.", "NTA, you really do not have to use your personal money to do something you didn't agree to be a part of and do not partake in. Just be kind but firm, \"thank you for inviting me to join your tradition, that makes me feel really good! Unfortunately it's my personal choice to respectfully decline\" or something. If they don't respect that, and kinda sounds like they might not, that's on them. You even get to do a white lie about having a hereditary tendency to diabetes or high blood cholesterol or something, if you need to. But if they won't stop badgering you about it you might have to choose to not work there anymore or just... do it anyway... Sometimes fitting in and being a team player is hard!", "Bring in big bag of sugar free toffees then watch whilst they\u2019re running with the shits /s", "NTA. Clearly no one ever explained the word no to them. You said you weren't going to participate. Once you said that, they should have kept the rotation going.", "NTA, you are correct in not being required to do anything that\u2019s not part of your job. \n\nUnderstand that your coworkers will dislike you for not being part of the team and they are not wrong for this.", "NTA but like, if you don\u2019t want to be ostracized bring in something you like instead (if it was my office demanding such things, I would bring in savoury croissants)", "NTA", "NTA. You don't eat the sweets, why would you buy them?\n\nThe only way you MIGHT be asshole adjacent would be if they actually asked/said ahead of time that it was your turn to buy the sweets and you said \"Yeah, sure!\" and then didn't get them. But I'm guessing you didn't do that, because that's just wierd and kinda mean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they just... assumed you were going to bring in sweets and didn't actually ask, that's 100% on them.", "Info- did you tell them before your day that you didn\u2019t want in?   \nIf you did, they\u2019re being unfair.

You\u2019re right that you should not be required to subsidize this little socializing ritual at the office ever. \n\nJust be aware they are also not required to like you. Not being liked by your coworkers can have various consequences depending on your job. If you have a job where being the office pariah is irrelevant then stay strong OP. If not, you may want to rethink.", "ESH why don\u2019t you bring in fruit or something you do like?

If you are the guy who brings in donuts every Friday, people feel like they are entitled to the donuts you bring and will only become upset with you for not bringing them. There is no social engineering positive.\n\nIf you are the guy who brings in donuts for a specific person's birthday, or to acknowledge when a specific team hits a milestone, or as a thank you when someone does you a huge favor, the social engineering benefits are high. People will think more positively about you, and you may be able to call on favors or have less resistance when seeing promotion paths down the line from peers.\n\nCold and cynical though this view may be, its work, not family. If you are investing time and money on treating coworkers, it should be for a work benefit.", "YTA\n\nYeah it sucks, and logically I agree with you. But it sounds like they are kind of a close knit group and they are trying to include you too. So to them, you are just shunning them. People are weird. Just buy some cupcakes, and take some of their stuff. Even if you don't eat it. lol. Social conventions are stupid but they go a long way in keeping things civil.", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t feel forced to do something you aren\u2019t required to do, but at the same time, I hate the way you said that you shouldn\u2019t have to do it because you get no personal benefit from it.", "YTA because it\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about a shared sense of community. This is the stuff that actually gets you promoted, being popular around the office. \n\nYou can bring in whatever you want. It could be a sweet you can actually eat or something you have a coupon for. But don\u2019t be that asshole.", "ESH it really wouldn\u2019t hurt to bring something in to keep the peace and play nice . If you refrain from eating their sweets I can\u2019t see that bringing in something from a nearby bakery is such a big deal .Sometimes it\u2019s a fact of life that we live and work with people with different ideas . \nThey are AH for being so pushy . \nReally people pick your battles - this isn\u2019t a hill to die on .", "Leaning towards a soft YTA. I think the best course of action for you would be to exit that cycle entirely, where you don't bring nor take any candy, until you are once again comfortable with the idea, at which point you'd being candies for the others.\n\nThat's what I would do at least.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
