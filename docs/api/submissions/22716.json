That's only $62.50 per person, per year.", "If someone wants to bring in snacks or treats for others, they can do so. But it should never be forced or even expected for anyone to do it. Even the person that brings in a snack every Monday isn't required to do so.\n\nThe problem is it usually starts as one person doing a nice gesture a couple of times, and then someone else joins in, and it suddenly grows into a rotating thing which is now required by all and just is more stressful than it needs to be.", "I hate this.

It\u2019s like those stupid \u201cget to know you\u201d games that they\u2019ll play at orientation, or maybe on the first day of class in school or something. Nobody likes those, everyone hates them. But we all feel compelled to do it because it\u2019s what\u2019s socially acceptable\n\nEDIT: it would also be different if OP was partaking but then refused to bring in sweets of their own, I feel like if you\u2019re taking the sweets then you\u2019re entering the agreement to bring some of your own. But they\u2019re not doing that either", "He is not a asshole at all.", "Same, never worked public sector and every place I've worked (about 10 different companies) provided tea and coffee.

The sweets were provided by the company! That's how you get everyone to participate.", "beat me to it.", "Once you get used to that sugar fix at work, it\u2019s really hard to quit.

I got a mini fridge for my lunch (there wasn't a communal fridge) and a keurig because the station coffee was garbage. I happily supplied coffee and creamer to anyone who asked, and everything went great until tons of people from all over campus started using it instead of the office supplies. I had to put up a tip jar and lock the kcups in a drawer after catching 3 sales dudes from another entire department using my office as a lounge with clients.", "Or just say it\u2019s against your religion.
