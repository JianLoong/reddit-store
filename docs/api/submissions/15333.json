Also our honeymoon there was fantastic, which is just more reasons to bring my best friend there as well in order to bring joy to her after a couple of very hard years for her psyche.

You want to share a place you loved with say your parents? Siblings? Maybe kids one day? All no?

Also our honeymoon there was fantastic, which is just more reasons to bring my best friend there as well in order to bring joy to her after a couple of very hard years for her psyche\n\nThat's a wonderful thing you are doing for your best friend. I honestly don't know anyone can object to this beautiful idea. \n\nHave you asked what specifically your husband's problem is beyond \"we had our honeymoon there\"? His reaction is irrational to say the least.", "NTA. Your husband is being weird and controlling. I\u2019ve taken my SO to my favorite foreign places and I\u2019ve gone with friends to those same places. It doesn\u2019t take any of the magic away from your honeymoon if you visit a place again or before or whenever. If I enjoy a place, I will do so as often as I want with whomever I want. Tell your husband to stop thinking he has a monopoly on Mykonos.", "NTA at all. Mykonos is a wonderful destination and, seeing you had a great time there, and already are familiar with the place, it makes all the sence to bring your friend there to have some fun and forget her troubles, even for a bit.\n\nI do not understand why your husband has had such a strong reaction to this idea tho. Did he provide any other explanation aside \"It was our special place\"? Is he friends with your friend? Woyld he have had the same reaction if you would have gone there with a family member, as an example? The \"with anyone else\" part threw me off. Is yoyr hobeymoon spot off limits just because?", "NAH \n\nYou're not wrong in saying that you can go there with everyone, but I guess your husband feels really close to the place. He has linked the place to you and he must think that your friend is taking his place. He probably wanted to go back there as well with you, and you not even thinking of going with him must have hurt him. So I can partially understand him too, that's why I'm saying nah...", "Wait til man\u2019s hears about Paris", "NTA.  Your husband\u2019s reaction is bizarre.  Going back to Mykonos with your friend in no way cheapens or invalidates your honeymoon.  Does your husband usually feel so easily threatened?", "NTA, it\u2019s a nice place and you can enjoy it in different ways with different people. \n\nI go on holiday with my bf in a place I was on my honeymoon with way ex wife with. Love Greece, fantastic place. \n\nWhat I would recommend is go somewhere new in Greece with your husband. Try out Lakka in Paxos and Ithaca!", "I think NAH\n\nYour husband looks at Mykonos as a special place that was a shared experience for the two of you. I get it that now (to your husband), Mykonos is just \"any other place\" rather than the one the two of you shared as a married couple. Now he thinks that for you, it wasn't special - so maybe (in his mind) you don't think HE is special and worth setting apart.\n\nThere are so many islands in Greece to explore - Santorini? Corfu? Why not explore a new one and have a special shared experience with your friend?\n\nI don't think either of you are AH, but I too have a husband who puts weight on the more sentimental (in my mind) things about our wedding, and honestly? if it's important to him, I try to respect it since it doesn't take much out of my life, and he would do the same for me if I said something was important to me that he hadn't considered.", "NAH.\n\nPersonally, I agree with what you are saying.  But I'm not that sentimental of a person.\n\nI know some people that feel very strongly about this.  Where they went for their honeymoon is a place that is \"theirs\" together.  Of course other people are going to go there.  But not with YOU.  It's a place they only go together.\n\nSo I don't think your husband is necessarily being irrational;  there are people that feel that way about their honeymoon destination;  or other spots \"meaningful\" in their relationship.", "NTA, this is weird and controlling behavior from your husband. It's not like you're bringing another man there. The only explanation I can think of that's not 100% irrational is if your husband has reasons to think you're into your friend. Assuming that's not the case, his reaction is very odd.", "I think this is more about feeling left out. I\u2019m assuming your husband also had a fantastic experience on your honeymoon & probably doesn\u2019t love that you will get to go again without him.\n\nNAH", "NTA \n\nyou had an amazing experience there and you know that she will, too. he\u2019s being weird and needs to get over it. it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going there to be romantic with her, so there shouldn\u2019t be an issue. if anything he should be happy because you can remember and mentally re live  how much fun you guys had there.", "NAH. This is where the line between consultation and asking for permission gets blurred on this sub. Obviously you don\u2019t need permission from your husband to go on a trip and you can go. But I think it\u2019s weird that there wasn\u2019t a \u201chey honey, taking Friend on a trip to get her spirits up, any ideas where we should go?\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m thinking of taking friend to Mykonos\u201d before it\u2019s all booked and decided. \n\nIt seems irrational the way your husband reacted. But people have irrational desires. Isn\u2019t marriage making that compromise by going literally anywhere else in the world if it bothers him that much?", "NAH\n\nBut you need to communicate stuff like that with your husband beforehand as obviously the place has a special meaning to both of you.\n\nYou could have just said \"Hey honey, Stella just got out of a bad relationship and I want to do something nice for her. Would you mind if I take her to Mykonos for a few days?\"", "NTA because you're right you all don't own the place and it doesn't make your honeymoon any less special. However I wonder if this is indicitave of other ways your husband thinks your friend may be too involved in you all's life. He may think that she's around too much or you put too much of your energy into her.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your husband is feeling a bit jealous. Perhaps he wishes you guys could go back together? Or do something special just the two of you? \n\nAnd it\u2019s normal to feel a twinge of oh that was our special place. Or that\u2019s our special thing. The blocking off an entire city/country? No. Becoming furious over it? Also no.", "WTF? I don\u2019t get his reaction at all. It\u2019s making him uncomfortable that you\u2019re taking your friend to the same location in the world where you had your honeymoon. Are you booking a honeymoon suite to share with your friend? (I doubt it but his reaction is just so odd that I\u2019m trying to grasp some way for it to make sense.) People visit this location that aren\u2019t on their honeymoon. FFS, some people even live there. I am curious if he had been hoping to do another trip there with you as a second honeymoon at some point and that\u2019s fueling his response. I can kind of see how he would feel like you taking your best friend there if he intended to do a second honeymoon there now makes it feel more like just a vacation spot and less special location spot.", "I think if it was just a \u2018girls trip\u2019 then he would have somewhat of a position to gripe - but your friend is going through a tough time escaping that abus I\u2019ve relationship. You think your partner would have the emotional nuance of a fully developed adult to not make such a turbulent time about himself", "YTA. His reaction might seem strange to you, but if it hurts his feelings that you go back to your honeymoon destination without him, then why not pick *any* other destination with your friend? Go some place you both have never been and try something new. Besides, if you go to a new destination, then your friend won't have to hear about your honeymoon the whole time, which might be a bit uncomfortable since her marriage is ending (maybe it wouldn't bother her at all, but I'm just trying to say that switching the destination could be a win-win).\n\nTo me, picking a new destination seems like a no-brainer and an easy way to fix the situation. We don't always need to understand our spouse's feelings to respond to them appropriately.", "NTA - Unless you are staying in the same honeymoon suite then wtf is his problem? Mykonos is a pretty well travelled place too, bro needs to chill. You\u2019re trying to bring your friend happiness and he\u2019s trying to make you feel bad, not something to ignore if he does this regularly. You sound like a great friend, and that should be a quality he admires about you.", "Lol NTA Mykonos is amazing place for everyone, honeymoon, friend trip, everything. Your husband is overreacting for no reason. Glad you liked the island!", "NTA\n\nI don't understand at all unless this was some ultra-dream-place and you had lots of once-in-a-lifetime things here and now you're sharing that part of your marriage with your friend.  Or, unless your husband is jealous of the relationship (does he have reason to?)\n\nOdd.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'd even say it's a compliment to your marriage that you want to revisit the honey moon destination.\n\nThat said, what does you friend think? She's supposed to forget about her ex-husband during this trip. Is walking in the footsteps of you and your husband really a good idea? Will you be able to refrain from bringing up memories from your honey moon? Will she enjoy listening to memories from your honey moon?\n\nPersonally, I would have picked another Greek island. There's more than plenty.", "Info. Is this normal behavior from your husband or is it really weird? \n\nI don't think you're TA at all, but if this is super abnormal for him, then talk it out. \n\nIs he worried that this trip with your friend will overshadow your memories of your honeymoon? Is he feeling insecure and guilty that he hasn't done enough romantic things over the years? Is he afraid that when at the honeymoon location you'll forget you're with your friend and nor your husband and kiss her?  Did he get in an alteration with a mafia boss there and got told if they ever saw him or you in their town again, they'd take you out and he just wants to keep you safe?", "I cackled at this \ud83d\udc80", "Immature, insecure and controlling people will object to the idea.", "That is entirely the husband\u2019s imaginary problem.

Also, why isn\u2019t he also seeing why she wants to do that for her friend either???", "I think that's the case as well. He probably would have wanted to go back too.", "He would have no position to gripe if it was just a girls\u2019 trip. Visiting a place again does not negate a special occasion between two people.", "Or OP can enjoy a trip with her friend to a place she loves, and her husband can stop being a controlling weirdo who thinks that no one can ever enjoy a trip to the same place twice. OP going again doesn\u2019t negate their honeymoon or its sentimental value. He has made up a completely unnecessary and irrational problem.", "She knows this place, she likes it, and she knows exactly what to expect, so why wouldn't she go there again? Her husband is behaving in a weird and controlling way in this situation, and there is absolutely no reason for her to accommodate that kind of behavior.", "I mean your spouse shouldn't have control on where you decide to go. Him being so angry about it is unreasonable. Controling behaviour is not ok and should not be enabled. It's just a city, OP is not going there to have a honeymoon with her friend.", "Okay would you say the same thing if the **husband would bring his drinking buddy** to their **special honeymoon place** and party there? \n\nWould you say that **the wife is controlling and overreacting for being upset** that he would invite *some dude* to the place where they **celebrated their marriage**?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis feelings got hurt because she doesn't value their special place the same way he does. There is generally nothing wrong with that, that is a boundary for him and she is about to cross it. If she cares about her partner she would have a conversation with him and maybe find another place to stay.", "I\u2019m guessing OP would feel the same if the situation was reversed & hubby was bring his buddy there for a vacation.", "Because occasionally men will communicate with anger instead of just saying that their feelings are hurt. \n\nIt\u2019s really not that challenging. If I had a great time visiting somewhere I would definitely be jealous & bummed if everyone went without me.", "I 100% agree, was just trying my best to see it from his point of view - but it\u2019s all dumb to me tbh - places are places", "I don't think he's controlling her and telling her she can't go on the trip. Instead, he's telling her his feelings. He sees it as a memory for the two of them, and that will change if she makes it a friend trip. \n\nWe won't always understand our spouse's feelings, right? But that doesn't make them invalid. Of course it would be different if he tries to manipulate her emotionally throughout the marriage, but OP hasn't mentioned that at all. So, if it was me, if my husband was asking me to take my friend to literally any other place in the world, I would respect that. I might not feel the same way about the honeymoon destination as he does, but that wouldn't make his feelings *wrong*. Why not just take her somewhere new and awesome? Italy, Morocco, Belize, Vietnam, wherever!", "Of course I would say the same thing. If husband wants to take a bro trip, why would it matter? As long as nothing untoward is happening, why on earth would the other person care that they are revisiting a specific place?\n\nAs to your second part, yeah, OP can absolutely pick another place to visit, and perhaps they will, but I would say this isn\u2019t a normal or healthy boundary because there is absolutely nothing wrong with revisiting the place you went on your honeymoon. At that point it\u2019s just being controlling. The boundary should be that the husband doesn\u2019t get to dictate when and where OP can visit a specific locale. YMMV.", "The problem with your logic, and OPs husband by extension, is that a lot of special places can become exclusive to them if we go down that route. \n\nIf it would be the other way around as per your example, I would tell the wife to get over your self. \nOP is trying to give her best friend, who\u2019s had a few bad abusive years, a trip to a beautiful place and maybe give her some happiness in her life. She\u2019s not going to replicate their honeymoon. She\u2019s looking at a place that brings her joy and thinking her friend would benefit from it. \n\nThis is not a gender thing, it\u2019s a \u201cwe\u2019re not getting why he thinks that way\u201d. And if this is a boundary that he is setting, I worry about possible others he might set.", "I can understand that he might feel left out, and that\u2019s fine to explain to your spouse. The thing is, if he uses anger, he\u2019s not getting anywhere and it will look like he\u2019s controlling her.\n\nAnd being a man doesn\u2019t excuse using anger when you can\u2019t express your feelings. A healthy relationship means communicating effectively and not becoming angry when you can\u2019t express yourself.", ">However, my husband got irrationally furious when he found out, saying that this was our honeymoon place and now I want to take my best friend there as well\n\nGetting furious about it is not ok. He didn't calmy tell her his feelings he got angry at her.", "You get that you\u2019re saying OP should let herself be controlled by her husband\u2019s emotional impulses, right?", "If you would hold HER accountable just like HIM that is great. Some people do treat such situations differently depending on gender of the people involved.\n\nLike you said (YMMV) everyones boundaries are different, if it is something important to your partner why not respect it? As an example some people are fine not wearing their wedding rings all the time, for others its a must. But if your partner feels hurt and upset because you don't wear the wedding ring why not not have a conversation about it. Find a middle ground and work on the problem like partners.\n\nFor me, I wouldn't care about such things but tbf I am not even married. But I can understand that if someone wants cherish their marriage by keeping their special place to themselves I wouldn't think that is controlling. It is up to OP to decide if hurting her partner is worth it.", "Okay wait, it is **not** about like idk \"**a restaurant**\" that they can only visit together, haha. That would be weird if someone would be upset that someone goes to their \"special restaurant\" ...okay but I know that such a scenario 100% happened **AND** that would be very controlling behaviour. \n\nBut its from their WEDDING, their honeymoon place where they spend their first days and nights as wife and husband. **For some people this is really important**. I know people that visit their honeymoon destination every year. And it might not be important for you but a few others see it as their \"heaven on earth\".\n\nYes she is doing something **really amazing** for her friend, but why could it not be anywhere else? There is a ton of beautiful places in Greece, some other comments even listed some beautiful places that they know. Even in whole Europe we have so many amazing places here, why does it need to be the one place that would hurt your partner?\n\nAnd the gender thing is just to make sure, **we all have biases** and the User said that they would treat it the same way, in any scenario which is all I wanted to know.", "Being upset because his wife is taking her bff to his favorite place is not controlling. He never said she couldn\u2019t go.", "Because it appears to be  equally important to OP to take her best friend to experience this place she loves. The husband\u2019s issue is irrational. OP visiting the same place in no way negates their honeymoon. It\u2019s entirely possible to visit a place with different people and come away with fantastic experiences without one diminishing the other.\n\nThe husband\u2019s boundary, as you put it, has actual real world consequences. OP is now visiting a completely different place (which maybe they will love or maybe they won\u2019t) instead of sharing the trip they wanted with their best friend. In my opinion that trumps whatever weird possessive illusion the husband has. If his honeymoon and marriage are so easily impacted because god forbid someone touch ground in the same location twice, there are bigger issues he needs to deal with.", "Like I\u2019ve said in another comment, it seems I may not be as emotional as what I previously thought. \n\nTo me, I cherish the time I had and not where I went. My honeymoon cannot be duplicated, even if I have been back with the same person since then. That trip will always be special for what it was, my honeymoon. I\u2019ve travelled many times (not yet to Greece, on my bucket list) in different ways (a lot of road trips and camping) and all my trips are individually important. I wouldn\u2019t tell my husband not to go somewhere because we had a special trip at one point together. \n\nMy philosophy is different, doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m right and he\u2019s wrong. Just that, he lashed out to her in anger when she is trying to bring joy to someone else. But to be fair, Mykonos is one of the most beautiful places to go visit. It\u2019s not like they went to a small b&b in a moor in the middle of nowhere!", "A wedding and a honeymoon, while important, are events. Their marriage is the ongoing thing. Let\u2019s say they got married at the Plaza in NY. If a few years down the line, OP threw another event there, does that completely negate their wedding because it\u2019s in the same space? Of course not.", "And him becoming irrationally furious and insisting that she could have made her feel better anywhere  makes her feel great about her choice? \n\nSetting boundaries are fine, telling someone that they aren\u2019t comfortable is what\u2019s needed. But when using anger to express yourself might automatically create a fight and then push someone to change their mind even when they don\u2019t want to. \n\nControlling with words maybe no, but his actions don\u2019t help the situation overall to make her change her mind.", "It doesn't negate it but changes its meaning. It wouldn't be special anymore...\n\nHow can you know that Mykonos would be just as beautiful and lovely like the last time? You can't, holiday destinations can change fast depending on date and time.\n\nIdk it is such a weird hill to die on. Why would you want to hurt your partners feelings and upset them if you can avoid it so easily?", "It doesn't negate their wedding? nobody is saying that? \n\nBut if it is an important place to your partner with meaning and love why would you want to destroy that for them. If you can change the destination why is it such a big deal? If you can plan the event anywhere else why wouldn't you?\n\nIf my partner said that the place where we met and had our first kiss, is super important to them and they want to keep it special, why would want to destroy that by bringing other people there?", "Married people annoy each other & often think they share a brain so communication can get messy. Husband is upset. OP thinks he\u2019s irrational. Apparently no one wants to see it from the other person\u2019s perspective.\n\nI have been married for 31 yrs if my husband decided to bring his buddies to our stay at our favorite place I would have something to say about it. I wanna go!!!", "Married people also need to learn to communicate efficiently to be happy. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve had to learn with my husband in our 23 years together. \n\nCommunication is problematic here, I totally agree.  But I also see OPs perspective too. I\u2019ve gone to places that were special to us with other people after we\u2019ve gone because I wanted to experience it a different way. He never blinked or said anything.  To him I wasn\u2019t recreating our special trip, I was sharing with others the joy I had a that place. \n\nMaybe my view is skewed because we have travelled a lot (not necessarily huge trips through). I\u2019ve done duplicate trips to same destinations in different ways and they all have a special places in my heart. I may not be as emotional as I thought I was!"]}
