So this was somewhat a miracle baby and we were both fully prepared to have this baby, until she unfortunately miscarried\u2026it was really horrible to say the least. She fell into a depression and I was sad too.  \n\n2 weeks later, I had a trip planned for my brothers bachelor\u2019s party. This was planned way before we even found out she was pregnant.  She told me how she didn\u2019t want me to go and that she still needs me but I wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted me to do if I stayed, I told her I will be back in 3 days and she seemed fine with that answer because she gave me the go ahead. The day I was leaving she asked me \u201c are you seriously actually going to go\u201d and I told her I had too since the ticket and hotel is non refundable. So I did end up going. \n\nThe whole trip I barley herd from her and I tried calling her and she just ignored me, I came home from the trip, to our apartment and all of her stuff was gone and she took my dog and dropped it off over my parents house. I went to my moms house and picked up my dog and she told me my girlfriend dropped the dog off, because she couldn\u2019t watch it and she needed space from me\u2026 I told my mom what happened and she told me I was idiot and an asshole for what I did. I don\u2019t believe what I did was wrong by going on this trip she told me I could go, I tried calling her to sort this out because I love her and i just been ignored so far\u2026 so AITA?\n\nEdit: yes sorry for the typo I\u2019m a male, typo I\u2019m at work and she told me point blank that I could go.\n\nSecond edit: I get it my spelling sucks I wrote this at work, second I\u2019m not blaming my gf for me going to Vegas. I\u2019m just simply saying she gave me an okay that I thought at that time she truly didn\u2019t care. Lastly, saying remarks regarding that her having a miscarriage was the best thing that could happen is extremely hurtful.

Especially when it was from a pregnancy they thought they would never be able to have. \n\nGood for her for calling you out, and setting up boundaries for when you get back. You just betrayed her trust in a way that you really can't recover from.", "YTA - Especially for not having a more detailed conversation about this.

That's not enough to make your ego big, what was she thinking?\n\nYou're right -- this IS all her fault.\n\nWhy don't you officially break up with her and let her heal from her miscarriage by herself.

I\u2019m pretty sure, depending on what actual words she used and tone of voice, that she really didn\u2019t tell you to go and mean it. Leaving your girlfriend for a 3 day trip after she suffered a very traumatic incident was an asshole move for sure.", "While you may have asked to still go, she wanted you to make the choice of choosing her. You didn't choose the person who was struggling after the miscarriage. You chose to go to the bachelor party. You made choices that lead her to make choices of her own.", "YTA. But you already know that don't you.", "YTA. Dude, you F-ed up big time. Your girlfriend finds out about a surprise pregnancy with your baby and then has a miscarriage and you go right off on a trip to a bachelor party (think strippers and all that) saying you have to because your hotel etc are non-refundable....after she asked you NOT to go because she needed you at this time. Sure she then told you to go, but you knew she really wanted you there.  One man to another, I gotta tell you that is really not cool.   I wouldn't blame her if she decides not to take you back.", "YTA - she clearly wanted you to stay as emotional support for the trauma she just went through, and you blew her off to go to a bachelor party. Your mom is right. YTA.", "YTA she lost a baby she never thought she\u2019d have and you left her bc the trip was paid for! She told you to go but parents that actually love their unborn and lost child often go through depression and don\u2019t say what they are feeling. Something you clearly don\u2019t know  about bc you are over it like child didn\u2019t mean anything to you. Yes you were sad but over it  just in time for your trip. How convenient.

You're a stone's throw away from 30 fucking years old and you really need us to spell out in the comments why YTA?", "She just lost a baby. Asked you not to go.

You left her during a time that she was struggling, AFTER she straight up told you she still needs you\u2026. Like, read between the lines here a little bit! Read the room!", "Sir YTA, she tried to tell you how she felt and you quite literally neglected her feelings\u2026 she most likely experienced some trauma as kid, hence why this probably opened up an old wound. Also leave her alone your not entitled to speak to her after you left her to have fun.", "I\u2019m going with soft YTA because she told you to go even though she didn\u2019t want you to go.  I hate it when people do this kind of thing like it\u2019s some kind of test.  She should have stated her real opinion and you should have asked her your questions instead of just wondering and hoping.  I get that you felt this was an important thing for your brother but it wasn\u2019t like it was the wedding and you could have skipped it.  It would have been best to talk to your brother or mom or get an outside opinion and perspective BEFORE the trip.  Because you prioritized a fun trip over your grieving girlfriend it makes you TA even though she said you could go.  Has she not given permission it would have been a solid YTA\nEdit to add that I am a woman and changed the word women to people so people will focus on the fact that I actually said he\u2019s TA either way and not be mad that I said women instead of SO\u2019s.", "INFO: your post indicates you\u2019re both female so I\u2019m curious what your relationship dynamic is. Is there a male third, open relationship, etc.? Or was it just a typo?", "NTA \n\nShe has the right to grieve and be sad as she went through something traumatic. Everybody grieves at their own pace and just because you were feeling up to go doesn\u2019t mean she was in a better place. That doesn\u2019t give her the right to just ignore you and give you the silent treatment. That\u2019s childish and doesn\u2019t solve anything. If she were to have said, \u201cI\u2019m hurt by what you did. I need some time to figure things out so I\u2019m moving my things. Please don\u2019t call/text me for *insert time here*. I\u2019ll reach out after that and if I need more time I\u2019ll say so.\u201d That would be way more mature and helpful. Grief can be a strange thing that everybody does different but if she said you could go and then wanted you to stay but then refuses to talk to you when you get back that\u2019s a whole bunch of mixed signals that would be confusing to anybody. It probably would be a good idea to talk to a couples counselor together.", "I think NTA only because she told you it was fine to go. Miscarriages are very hard emotionally but she gave you the OK. If she can't communicate her needs you can't help her properly. But it sounds like your gf was told it would be difficult to create a baby without help, not impossible. You both really should learn the difference between sterile and \"might have fertility issues in the future\" because I'm guessing you weren't being safe at all because you thought \"whoohoo she can't get knocked up so no condoms for me\"", "YTA - even the best relationships sometimes end due to loss, and you destabilized yours needlessly. She didn\u2019t trap you either. From your own admission, your girlfriend was very clear that she didn\u2019t want you to go (remember you said \u201cit was really horrible to say the least\u201d ?!) and you pushed it. What else did you need to hear from her? Of course she inevitably said that it was your choice. And of course when you made the choice that deeply hurt her, she made her own choice to establish a boundary while she processes all of this. I am so sorry for the multiple things she is now grieving about.", "ESH, because it appears you both never actually had a grown up conversation about each other's wants and needs.", "Yeah I\u2019ve heard I can\u2019t get pregnant before too. Now I have a daughter. \n\nI would have gone tho, that\u2019s your brother. Pretty sure your bro will always be there for you. No guarantee w romantic relationships. \n\nNta", "You are both women and she got pregnant? Uhhhh\u2026", "Edit: I\u2019m a fool who missed out on the part that she had a miscarriage. YTA op. \n\nNTA. She hasn\u2019t has the child yet nor is she heavily pregnant. I don\u2019t see why she can\u2019t take care of herself for three days, she\u2019s a grown woman. Personally, I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. Sounds like an overreaction on her part.", "NAH, though you could/should have done a little more to accommodate her mental health needs.  In a perfect world, you'd have arranged for someone you both trust (maybe one of your parents or a neighbour that's also had a miscarriage in the past?) to stay with her while you're gone, not just to help her with responsibilities and routines, but even just to talk about stuff she's struggling with that she feels unable to bring up with you.  You had over a week to make calls and plans, but being short sighted and a little thoughtless does not equate to being malicious.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is just how personal carrying a child is.  Sure, everyone in the family is excited, but the mother(/surrogate) is the one sustaining them, living with every movement they make.  You start to talk to the foetus, asking yourself all kinds of questions.  What will they look like?  Will they be introverted or extraverted?  What will their favourite food be?  How old will they be when they have their real first kiss?  You get EXTREMELY attached, EXTREMELY quickly and...  that's all ripped away, with no notice, for no reason.  I think it's extremely telling that she asked your parents to take care of the dog, she likely doesn't trust herself to keep ANYTHING alive right now and needs someone(s) to help her through that.", "NTA.  Miscarriages are shitty. I went through my fair share of it.  I'm also assuming this happened early on in the pregnancy.  Your already planned trip was for your brothers bachelor party. It has also been two weeks after the miscarriage. You would only be gone three days. Your gf has the right to grieve as long as she needs but I think in this circumstances, she needs to be understanding and let you go.", "YTA for not using protection.  You da man for calling her on her \u201cyou can go\u201d that really means \u201cyou can\u2019t go\u201d bullshit.  When a man does that to a woman, he\u2019s called controlling and manipulative by the Redditverse. And I agree with that, and it goes both ways.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's funny, recently I saw a post on here (and I even joined in commenting my experience) where a woman who went through a miscarriage was deemed the asshole because she used the circumstance to unfairly demand a lot of everyone around her (or something like that, I don't remember the full details). \n\nI'm a woman who has had multiple miscarriages. I understand it is absolutely devastating and causes a lot of awful feelings, but it sounds like you both were failing to communicate. \n\nYou interpreted her likely exasperated/sarcastic comment as a \"yes, go\", and she also chose to communicate in that way instead of a more serious sit down (although, I'll admit it's unclear how level headed of a conversation you guys had).\n\nImagine the conversation went like this: she says she needs support, and feels uncomfortable with you being away for so long. You could have expressed support. You could have said, \"this is so devastating to me too, and I can't even imagine what you're going through. I know it's a really difficult decision to make, but my brother is so important to me too, and I want to be there for him during this once in a lifetime event. Is there any way we can compromise? Maybe I could come home one day early, I can promise to check in on you at multiple set times, I can help you plan a fun weekend for yourself with your friends or family, I'll pay for a spa day for you, I'll facetime you before bed each night.\" Etc. \n\nFrankly it sounds like you waited for the first \"out\", the first hint of \"I guess she gave up\" and then kinda ignored the subject until it was time to go. Maybe she didn't bring it up again because she is scared to confront you. \n\nI do think that you're likely way way more TA than her. It's entirely possible that she did try to have a reasonable conversation with you and you shut her out entirely. But based on the information in your post, it sounds like she also failed to communicate her specific needs, so she is slightly TA too. \n\nBefore anyone comes for me, let me again remind you that I'm a woman who's gone through this experience. I've also spent much of my life terrified to advocate for myself and my needs, which in some ways is like being TA, but to oneself. I wasted many years of my life tiptoing around others and never speaking up when I was hurting. I hope for her that she's able to continue to advocate for her needs, and I'm proud of her for packing up and leaving when she didn't feel like she was getting what she needed.

It can last months from the day you find out the foetus/baby is no longer alive until everything is gone from the uterus, so 2 weeks most likely means she hasn\u2019t even healed from the physical part of the miscarriage. (Not to mention the psychological aspect.)", "What if it was two days? Two hours? The fact is it\u2019s been two weeks. That is not unreasonable when a person is grieving. If, or when, it gets to an unreasonable two- x and she needs to seek professional help, then that is another conversation. \n\nSo far, OP describes a perfectly reasonable request from his GF and then cries that he would have stayed if only GF had expressed her needs *three times* or given him an ultimatum, *then* he would have stayed.\n\nWell done OP\u2019s GF, I say.", "He does have the right to a life outside of her, but you\u2019re forgetting she JUST had a miscarriage. Maybe you should go through being told you\u2019re basically infertile, get pregnant and want the baby so much, and then miscarry it while having very little support from your partner. \n\nI feel like you have no concept of how horrible someone\u2019s emotions and hormones can go after a miscarriage, at least for the first month or more. OP acted selfishly.", ">Turns out to her \u201cstruggle with fertility\u201d was the same thing as \u201cyou are sterile\u201d so she was having lots of unprotected sex.\n\nTale as old as time.", "OT, but this was my reaction when my ex (35 at the time, and we where then still friends after the break up) said he and his then GF had a pregnancy scare, and I was like:\n\nBut you had protection? He looked at me sheepishly and said No\n\nThe first and only time I ever slapped him, wish I had done it everytime he was acting like an ass during our relationship, but anyway.\n\n\"But she's on the pill at least?\" Apparently not, she is using the one most useless method where you count days to tell when you're least/most fertile. \ud83d\ude43\n\n\"Oh but we're not looking to have a kid right now, but there's one more solution, abortion!\"\n\nLet me tell you, I am pro-choice and don't get easily mad, but what that idiot said made me terribly angry and I was in complete disbelief..

That\u2019s what makes them my *partner.*", "But how long?", "She used them. He argued.

I have had one and I can tell that I felt the change in my body about the day the egg mounted in the uterine wall. Nearly directly did I feel a devestating nausea which made my other pregnacies difficult. I've bled, womited, fainted, couldn't stand some smells to the extent that no red meat could be served at all during the pregnancies. I will be nice, nicer than someone deserve who has an opinion on pregnancies, misscarriages or internal hormonal wars without a uterus, I will name this a lack of knowledge rather than ignorance. I hope you mean well..\nBUT. This is a matter of her body, her grief, her needs and there is not something that reads too needy. The only thing that exists is a lack of understanding and willingness to meet someones wishes and needs. If you dont want that when your partner is vulnerable, its up to each and every one of us, but dont expect them to patiently wait when you do yours. If its no us, its every one for themselves. And I'm rather sure this is what the gf is wondering about now.", "He can do all the fun things he wants to, now that he's single.

That communication falling on ears that didn't want to hear that isn't her problem and no amount of communication is effective enough when the other person refuses to listen.\n\nIt's astounding that I see him take 'I don't care, just go' at sheer no-context face value but absolutely refuse to take her first request of him not going at that same face value.", "She did tell him, he ignored it, she shouldn't have to beg the man that she has been with for over a year, living with to stay with her after the recent loss of their miracle baby, and to look after his bastard dog aswell when he was away the fucking gall that this man has is unbelievable. He made his bed, and he can lay in it.\n\nCan you imagine what this man would be like if they ever went through IVF? He would leave her broken in a heartbeat. IVF can take years and be incredibly draining on a woman physical and emotional aswell as being mentally exhausting and downright depressing for both parties, this man would never be able to deal with any of that because of how immature he is.\n\nWhat would have happened if she did give him the ultimatum? What if she said if you leave, we are done? Would this man then throw that in her face every chance he gets? Absolutely, he would. If you ever have to give your partner an ultimatum, the relationship is virtually over, ultimatums come after asking, begging and pleading for something to change and the other person not wanting to budge on their decision. \n\nHe made his decision even after she asked him not to leave because she needed him, he choose to ignore her feelings, say oh well I was with you for the 2 weeks, even though you're in a deep depression at this moment in time I'm fucking off on a 3 day bender, oh and look after the dog for me as you grieve our lost miracle child. \n\nOP, you're almost 30.

No way can an almost 30 year old be this dense.", "Lol ok", "Yes, I have.  And grief is different for everyone.   Different losses have impacted me in different ways.

Your regret is too little and too late.", "Now she\u2019s valuing her mental health by getting rid of someone who showed no concern for her and what she needed during such a traumatic time. You said she went through horrible things before. Perhaps she\u2019s also learned to put up a tough front. And perhaps she also needed someone to say that she has been through too much for a person ever, let alone to someone so young and that they want to stay and support her. You obviously are too selfish to be that person for her. \n\nAlso the fact that the money is non refundable doesn\u2019t help your case. That\u2019s called a sunken cost. Look it up.

You should've come to the conclusion to not go on your own.", "You regret it because you actually suffered consequences for leaving, not because you hurt her.", "Lol you literally answered your own question, grief is different for everyone. She clearly was still hurting. Somebody else might have been fine after 2 weeks, OPs girlfriend wasn't.", "You just said 'grief is different for everyone'. So why can't you seem to accept that OP's gf still hadn't recovered and still needed him to be there for her?", "It wasn\u2019t 5 years though. It was 2 weeks.

How many times can she ask him not to go before it's just a waste of her time and energy?\n\nBut then that changes the reason he stays, doesn't it? He wouldn't be staying because his partner needs him and she asked him to, he'd be staying so he's not single. \n\nShe shouldn't have to escalate a request for care to an ultimatum and it's wild that I'm seeing people suggest that she should have. Would she have to set that ultimatum every time she's requesting care with this set as the precedent? And maybe, the negotiations about her request for care had cemented that she was leaving no matter what so that ultimatum would have been a lie.\n\nI don't know her side. But I understand letting a person show how much they care when it's left up to them and then making a decision on whether or not that relationship is still worth pursuing.", "She shouldn't say that, because ultimatums are gross and manipulative.

You seem to know where the line is, where is it?", "Now timelines are obtuse.", "Until she doesn't need him not to go. Duh.", "There is not a magic number right for everyone. That\u2019s not how grief and loss work. He needed to actually listen to his supposed loved one rather than badger and wear her down till she said what he wanted to hear.
