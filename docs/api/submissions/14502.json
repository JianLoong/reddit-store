So this was somewhat a miracle baby and we were both fully prepared to have this baby, until she unfortunately miscarried\u2026it was really horrible to say the least. She fell into a depression and I was sad too.  \n\n2 weeks later, I had a trip planned for my brothers bachelor\u2019s party. This was planned way before we even found out she was pregnant.  She told me how she didn\u2019t want me to go and that she still needs me but I wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted me to do if I stayed, I told her I will be back in 3 days and she seemed fine with that answer because she gave me the go ahead. The day I was leaving she asked me \u201c are you seriously actually going to go\u201d and I told her I had too since the ticket and hotel is non refundable. So I did end up going. \n\nThe whole trip I barley herd from her and I tried calling her and she just ignored me, I came home from the trip, to our apartment and all of her stuff was gone and she took my dog and dropped it off over my parents house. I went to my moms house and picked up my dog and she told me my girlfriend dropped the dog off, because she couldn\u2019t watch it and she needed space from me\u2026 I told my mom what happened and she told me I was idiot and an asshole for what I did. I don\u2019t believe what I did was wrong by going on this trip she told me I could go, I tried calling her to sort this out because I love her and i just been ignored so far\u2026 so AITA?\n\nEdit: yes sorry for the typo I\u2019m a male, typo I\u2019m at work and she told me point blank that I could go.\n\nSecond edit: I get it my spelling sucks I wrote this at work, second I\u2019m not blaming my gf for me going to Vegas. I\u2019m just simply saying she gave me an okay that I thought at that time she truly didn\u2019t care. Lastly, saying remarks regarding that her having a miscarriage was the best thing that could happen is extremely hurtful.

Especially when it was from a pregnancy they thought they would never be able to have. \n\nGood for her for calling you out, and setting up boundaries for when you get back. You just betrayed her trust in a way that you really can't recover from.", "YTA - Especially for not having a more detailed conversation about this.

That's not enough to make your ego big, what was she thinking?\n\nYou're right -- this IS all her fault.\n\nWhy don't you officially break up with her and let her heal from her miscarriage by herself.

I\u2019m pretty sure, depending on what actual words she used and tone of voice, that she really didn\u2019t tell you to go and mean it. Leaving your girlfriend for a 3 day trip after she suffered a very traumatic incident was an asshole move for sure.", "While you may have asked to still go, she wanted you to make the choice of choosing her. You didn't choose the person who was struggling after the miscarriage. You chose to go to the bachelor party. You made choices that lead her to make choices of her own.", "YTA. But you already know that don't you.", "YTA. Dude, you F-ed up big time. Your girlfriend finds out about a surprise pregnancy with your baby and then has a miscarriage and you go right off on a trip to a bachelor party (think strippers and all that) saying you have to because your hotel etc are non-refundable....after she asked you NOT to go because she needed you at this time. Sure she then told you to go, but you knew she really wanted you there.  One man to another, I gotta tell you that is really not cool.   I wouldn't blame her if she decides not to take you back.", "YTA - she clearly wanted you to stay as emotional support for the trauma she just went through, and you blew her off to go to a bachelor party. Your mom is right. YTA.", "YTA she lost a baby she never thought she\u2019d have and you left her bc the trip was paid for! She told you to go but parents that actually love their unborn and lost child often go through depression and don\u2019t say what they are feeling. Something you clearly don\u2019t know  about bc you are over it like child didn\u2019t mean anything to you. Yes you were sad but over it  just in time for your trip. How convenient.

You left her during a time that she was struggling, AFTER she straight up told you she still needs you\u2026. Like, read between the lines here a little bit! Read the room!", "Sir YTA, she tried to tell you how she felt and you quite literally neglected her feelings\u2026 she most likely experienced some trauma as kid, hence why this probably opened up an old wound. Also leave her alone your not entitled to speak to her after you left her to have fun.", "I\u2019m going with soft YTA because she told you to go even though she didn\u2019t want you to go.  I hate it when people do this kind of thing like it\u2019s some kind of test.  She should have stated her real opinion and you should have asked her your questions instead of just wondering and hoping.  I get that you felt this was an important thing for your brother but it wasn\u2019t like it was the wedding and you could have skipped it.  It would have been best to talk to your brother or mom or get an outside opinion and perspective BEFORE the trip.  Because you prioritized a fun trip over your grieving girlfriend it makes you TA even though she said you could go.  Has she not given permission it would have been a solid YTA\nEdit to add that I am a woman and changed the word women to people so that feminists don\u2019t get their hackles up because they don\u2019t like what I said even though they agree with my judgment.", "INFO: your post indicates you\u2019re both female so I\u2019m curious what your relationship dynamic is. Is there a male third, open relationship, etc.? Or was it just a typo?", "NTA \n\nShe has the right to grieve and be sad as she went through something traumatic. Everybody grieves at their own pace and just because you were feeling up to go doesn\u2019t mean she was in a better place. That doesn\u2019t give her the right to just ignore you and give you the silent treatment. That\u2019s childish and doesn\u2019t solve anything. If she were to have said, \u201cI\u2019m hurt by what you did. I need some time to figure things out so I\u2019m moving my things. Please don\u2019t call/text me for *insert time here*. I\u2019ll reach out after that and if I need more time I\u2019ll say so.\u201d That would be way more mature and helpful. Grief can be a strange thing that everybody does different but if she said you could go and then wanted you to stay but then refuses to talk to you when you get back that\u2019s a whole bunch of mixed signals that would be confusing to anybody. It probably would be a good idea to talk to a couples counselor together.", "I think NTA only because she told you it was fine to go. Miscarriages are very hard emotionally but she gave you the OK. If she can't communicate her needs you can't help her properly. But it sounds like your gf was told it would be difficult to create a baby without help, not impossible. You both really should learn the difference between sterile and \"might have fertility issues in the future\" because I'm guessing you weren't being safe at all because you thought \"whoohoo she can't get knocked up so no condoms for me\"", "YTA - even the best relationships sometimes end due to loss, and you destabilized yours needlessly. She didn\u2019t trap you either. From your own admission, your girlfriend was very clear that she didn\u2019t want you to go (remember you said \u201cit was really horrible to say the least\u201d ?!) and you pushed it. What else did you need to hear from her? Of course she inevitably said that it was your choice. And of course when you made the choice that deeply hurt her, she made her own choice to establish a boundary while she processes all of this. I am so sorry for the multiple things she is now grieving about.", "ESH, because it appears you both never actually had a grown up conversation about each other's wants and needs.", "Yeah I\u2019ve heard I can\u2019t get pregnant before too. Now I have a daughter. \n\nI would have gone tho, that\u2019s your brother. Pretty sure your bro will always be there for you. No guarantee w romantic relationships. \n\nNta", "You are both women and she got pregnant? Uhhhh\u2026", "Edit: I\u2019m a fool who missed out on the part that she had a miscarriage. YTA op. \n\nNTA. She hasn\u2019t has the child yet nor is she heavily pregnant. I don\u2019t see why she can\u2019t take care of herself for three days, she\u2019s a grown woman. Personally, I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. Sounds like an overreaction on her part.", "NAH, though you could/should have done a little more to accommodate her mental health needs.  In a perfect world, you'd have arranged for someone you both trust (maybe one of your parents or a neighbour that's also had a miscarriage in the past?) to stay with her while you're gone, not just to help her with responsibilities and routines, but even just to talk about stuff she's struggling with that she feels unable to bring up with you.  You had over a week to make calls and plans, but being short sighted and a little thoughtless does not equate to being malicious.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is just how personal carrying a child is.  Sure, everyone in the family is excited, but the mother(/surrogate) is the one sustaining them, living with every movement they make.  You start to talk to the foetus, asking yourself all kinds of questions.  What will they look like?  Will they be introverted or extraverted?  What will their favourite food be?  How old will they be when they have their real first kiss?  You get EXTREMELY attached, EXTREMELY quickly and...  that's all ripped away, with no notice, for no reason.  I think it's extremely telling that she asked your parents to take care of the dog, she likely doesn't trust herself to keep ANYTHING alive right now and needs someone(s) to help her through that.", "NTA.  Miscarriages are shitty. I went through my fair share of it.  I'm also assuming this happened early on in the pregnancy.  Your already planned trip was for your brothers bachelor party. It has also been two weeks after the miscarriage. You would only be gone three days. Your gf has the right to grieve as long as she needs but I think in this circumstances, she needs to be understanding and let you go.", "YTA for not using protection.  You da man for calling her on her \u201cyou can go\u201d that really means \u201cyou can\u2019t go\u201d bullshit.  When a man does that to a woman, he\u2019s called controlling and manipulative by the Redditverse. And I agree with that, and it goes both ways.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's funny, recently I saw a post on here (and I even joined in commenting my experience) where a woman who went through a miscarriage was deemed the asshole because she used the circumstance to unfairly demand a lot of everyone around her (or something like that, I don't remember the full details). \n\nI'm a woman who has had multiple miscarriages. I understand it is absolutely devastating and causes a lot of awful feelings, but it sounds like you both were failing to communicate. \n\nYou interpreted her likely exasperated/sarcastic comment as a \"yes, go\", and she also chose to communicate in that way instead of a more serious sit down (although, I'll admit it's unclear how level headed of a conversation you guys had).\n\nImagine the conversation went like this: she says she needs support, and feels uncomfortable with you being away for so long. You could have expressed support. You could have said, \"this is so devastating to me too, and I can't even imagine what you're going through. I know it's a really difficult decision to make, but my brother is so important to me too, and I want to be there for him during this once in a lifetime event. Is there any way we can compromise? Maybe I could come home one day early, I can promise to check in on you at multiple set times, I can help you plan a fun weekend for yourself with your friends or family, I'll pay for a spa day for you, I'll facetime you before bed each night.\" Etc. \n\nFrankly it sounds like you waited for the first \"out\", the first hint of \"I guess she gave up\" and then kinda ignored the subject until it was time to go. Maybe she didn't bring it up again because she is scared to confront you. \n\nI do think that you're likely way way more TA than her. It's entirely possible that she did try to have a reasonable conversation with you and you shut her out entirely. But based on the information in your post, it sounds like she also failed to communicate her specific needs, so she is slightly TA too. \n\nBefore anyone comes for me, let me again remind you that I'm a woman who's gone through this experience. I've also spent much of my life terrified to advocate for myself and my needs, which in some ways is like being TA, but to oneself. I wasted many years of my life tiptoing around others and never speaking up when I was hurting. I hope for her that she's able to continue to advocate for her needs, and I'm proud of her for packing up and leaving when she didn't feel like she was getting what she needed.

She needs to go to therapy or grief counseling, something you can't provide. 2 weeks isn't enough time for her to \"get over it,\" but you never said you were expecting her to be over it, those are words others are putting in your mouth. This trip was planned in advance, it was paid for, and you're allowed to take time for yourself too. People grieve differently! If you needed to take time away and do something fun to get your mind off the situation, she shouldn't be holding you emotionally hostage for going. She can make her own decisions, and if leaving is what she needs to do to think things over, so be it. I understand she's upset, but ignoring your calls when you tried to check up on her and taking off was immature on her end.", "NTA- it\u2019s a devastating loss but this is his BROTHER and it\u2019s only a few days\u2026 couldn\u2019t she have stayed with a relative or friend for support?

YTA.", "YTA", "I'm going for a soft YTA, and I say this with love because you are grieving too, albeit differently. \n\nI had a silent late miscarriage in early December. I also thought I could never conceive, and this was my first pregnancy, too. The emptiness that you get from the missing baby in your womb is indescribable. I felt and still feel so disconnected from everything. There is also little hope that I will conceive again, and if I do, will my other baby be viable? The fear of losing another is enough prevention to try. Now, your partner has less of a chance than me. She probably thinks this baby was her ONLY chance.\n\nI'm 4 months in, and I still cry about my pregnancy loss and have random triggers. Nearly every couple I see has the pram we were going to have. Nearly every couple on the street has a newborn. I cried for hours after the person on the corner showed off her baby to me because it wasn't mine, and I wanted mine.\n\nThe only saving grace is my partner. He was there. Even if I didn't need anything, he was there. He didn't need to do anything but be there to hold my hand. However, my partner and I grieved differently, and that was another battle I had to fight. Trying to understand someone else is just as sad as you, even though they don't look at it and are acting normal, it is incredibly difficult. Maybe* your girlfriend is the same? \n\nI can't imagine how your girlfriend must feel because in a time where she, too, feels empty and disconnected. She also feels unsupported and abandoned. You f**ked up, and I'm not sure you'll be able to salvage this relationship.", "YTA", "not saying its ok, but when a woman says fine... she never means fine. sorry YTA.", "28 with a 22 year old girlfriend. Gee, wonder how that happened. YTA", "YTA and the (hopefully permanent) ex.\n\nWhat logic is that? The trip was planned even before the pregnancy. Yeah, newsflash, things can happen, emergencies don't care if you have a trip planned or not. You could (and should) have been a supportive partner but you chose Vegas instead.", "ESH. She was manipulative and used weaponised silence to make you feel guilty after being petulant about you going after saying just go. You\u2019re also not the best because you should have considered her feelings more instead of wondering what you could do when you stayed, you should have asked her what she wanted you to do.

I was a bit sad, but you know, VEGAS BABY!\" YTA.", "\"I don't care, just go\" is not her blessing to go. It was her way of saying she didn't care anymore because you'd made it crystal clear to her that she didn't matter to you. \n\nShe asked you not to go and when you kept pushing the issue, she gave up because who wants to fight with someone who doesn't give a shit if they're hurting you. \n\nYTA. I'm glad she had enough self-respect and courage to leave you.", "INFO: Did you have a good time?", "OMFG She literally said multiple times she didn't want you to go, and you kept saying you were going anyway, what else was she going to say at that point?!\n\nYTA dude.  \nYou don't know what she needed you to do? She TOLD YOU; she needed you not to abandon her in her time of need.\n\nYou basically told her that the sunk cost fallacy was more important to you than her feelings.\n\nYou have some serious apologising to do, and don't do it expecting forgiveness or reconciliation - you may well have lost her for good but you can at least learn some empathy and humility from the experience.", "I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t give birth and have the burden of a selfish partner. I hope she heals, moves on, and finds someone that deserves her.", "\"I'm not a mind reader\" bro even reading this in text form without hearing her voice, everyone can tell how she meant it.

Like is she indefinitely disabled by this?  it's awful and a struggle but is she going to sit in a dark room forever and play sad music?  \n\nShe needs counseling, not bf to stay home and be sads.  Also, getting out and away to this weekend getaway is probably the best thing for OP's mental health following this trauma.  Two parties endured this loss so NTA", "YTA she needed you their for comfort she's aware she probably won't be able to conceive easily again and miscarried the whole I dont know what I would have done for her if I stayed anyway bs is rubbish she just wanted you", "let's not forget he also left his dog for her to take care wile he had fun", "I disagree maybe OP is neurodivergent or something but \"I don't care just go\" sounds like he could go to me if she didn't want him to go she would have said \"no don't go\" it sounds like she was playing mind games to guilt trip him I hope they can sort it out but NTA if she didn't communicate clearly to him", "Weeks after.

This is a giant neon post advertising toxic masculinity.", "Presumably OP has already had two full weeks of being second a shoulder to cry on and primary caretaker for a loss that he too experienced, although lesser.  He probably needs a break too or is that not valid because he's a man?", "So many miracle babies....well it's a miracle so we are keeping it...by we I mean me.", "I actually agree, as long as she had family to stay with.

She needed him specifically because he\u2019s the only other person who lost the same thing she did. Turns out he just didn\u2019t care about it as much.", "Yeah, I'm a little confused by the consensus here. This was a long planned event. She had had a miscarriage a few weeks before. How long is he supposed to put his life on hold for? Why is she the only one who gets to grief in her own way? Maybe this trip is exactly what he needed. \n\nIf she cant be alone for 3 days after a miscarriage, she needs to stay with a friend and maybe look into some therapy.", "We don\u2019t even know if she was physically well enough following the miscarriage. And he left his dog with her. Who knows if she was even physically able to care for the dog.", "STOP with the \u201cbut she told me I could go\u201d BS. You\u2019re almost 30, dude. She told you clearly what she needed. You told her clearly you wouldn\u2019t give it to her. After that, what\u2019s the point? You say if she had given you an ultimatum you would have stayed but it\u2019s not her job to threaten you into being a decent human being. You just wanted that so you could tell your friends \u201cShe\u2019s so irrational, she threatened to end our relationship over a bachelor party!\u201d", "You've admitted she said \"I don't care, just go\" after you said you were going in response to her not wanting you to go\n\nYou're a genuine idiot if you truly think she was \"giving you the go ahead\"", "Well, I really hope Vegas was worth your relationship because there is no going back. You just showed her how utterly selfish you are, how you won't be there for her during hard times. And that doesn't make for a good relationship. Despite your big age, you have a lot of growing up to do before moving on.", "Nah, she really didn\u2019t and everyone here seems to get that but you. She even had to take care of your dog. She was 2 weeks past a miscarriage. Was she even well enough to care for the dog? This miscarriage will haunt her forever.\n\nBut did you have fun? Get a lap dance?", "It was about your mental health.", "She did tell him not to go, twice.", "> She told me how she didn\u2019t want me to go and that she still needs me\n\nSo she said it outright at least once.\n\nIt reads like she said \"Don't go\" a bunch and he went \"Ehhhh but I really wanna go and it's non-refundable\" until she just gave up and accepted she was leaving him.\n\nAnd props to her for following through.", "OP knew she didn't want him to go. She said that. But I'm sure he wouldn't let it go and continued to bring it up, so she finally just told him she didn't care. OP is almost 30, he manipulated this situation to get his way and is playing victim in it all.", "Do us all a favor and learn to understand how people act when someone disregards their feelings. She said to go because there was no worth in putting any effort into keeping the relationship going.", "You really are intentionally dense, ain't ya?", "2 weeks is not a long period of time after a traumatic event like that.", "You\u2019re under every reply defending him lol this is definitely an alt account of OP", "Uhmm... excuse me. Have you got any clue how long a miscarriage can be? For me personally it was 8 weeks from hearing my baby's heart was no longer beating till actually no longer heading a dead foetus inside me. It was a medical hellscape that mostly consisted of waiting, lots of blood loss and eventually ended in a curatage. Even if it's a short process there is still a lot of blood loss, terrible cramping and the utter betrayal of your own body to deal with. \nNo one is fine two weeks after a miscarriage. You're still exhausted mentally and physically and being left by yourself for 3 days while your partner goes and parties will just make you feel even more worthless. Not only did your body betray you, but your partner apparently also does not care enough about you to keep you close during their hard time. \n\nSo yeah. OP is the asshole.\n\nYTA", "Have you ever had one?", "In the event of a miscarriage or any life event that affects your mental health, you expect to be able to at least rely on your partner for some comfort. Not that they're going to disappear and party whilst you're grieving. \nDepending on your partner is not making them responsible for your mental health in this scenario either. If my partner needed me then I'd do whatever I could to lighten the burden or just be there for comfort and I know he'd do the same for me.", "When I miscarried I wasn't even really able to process my feelings much for 2 weeks. I just bled and bled and bled. The pain in my abs was horrible. I just cried from the pain. I went to the hospital because I couldn't stop. And up to the due date of the baby was a roller coaster. My partner was there and I don't know what I would do if he wasn't", "She didn\u2019t make a trauma hostage. She asked the father of her dead baby to support her and when he refused, she packed her back and left to her own support system. Op definitely YTA", "Can't believe I have to say this to a fucking 28 year old, but unless you want kids, USE PROTECTION. \"We weren't trying\" YES YOU WERE. If you have unprotected sex, YOU. ARE. TRYING. FFS.", "I believe my comment started by validating that.", "It was a miracle", "Yeah I'm not really sure.  At the end of the day she needs counseling but I guess using this dude as a punching bag will do in a pinch since she's not going to own her mental health and get the aid she requires.  It's pretty troubling that an entire forum thinks her behavior and hostage taking are within the realm of reasonable.", "It is if you're playing primary caretaker for a loss that you also have experienced.", "Just an insomniac who feels passionately about the caretaker role/fatigue.", "You're perpetuating toxic masculinity with this take.  OP also lost a child and has had to be primary caretaker for weeks.", "Hey now, at some point in the past a doctor said she'll probably sorta maybe possibly not be able to have kids.\n\nSounds pretty clear cut to me", "No no, you see, when you and your partner decide you want a kid, a magic switch flips in your balls which increases sperm production by 350%, greatly increasing your chances of pregnancy! So as long as you have not decided you're trying and the magic switch is off babies are super unlikely. No protection necessary.", "You did but then you completely invalidated it here:\n>\"Idk what I would do for her if I stayed\" you could be there. Listen. Talk. Be there the bounce off. Empathise. Make her tea and just be present. So in essence, loads. What could you do for her on the trip? Text. Wow. Call. Super.\n\n\nBeing a male caretaker is the loneliest job in the world.  So what you're probably seeing is the male thought process of justifying self care by going on this trip.  OP clearly knows he can do those things but needs to not for three days.", "How is she using him as a punching bag? Sounds like she just broke up with him, which she is allowed to do. He\u2019s not allowed to \u201chold her hostage\u201d in a relationship either.", "I believe you when you say you don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s your fault, and that\u2019s exactly why you\u2019re single now. Yikes", "Looks like OP agreed with you which is why I\u2019m betting the ex gf needed space.", "Yeah totally, definitely meant that she is completely, 100% sterile!", "That doesn't invalidate it at all. One still needs to look after oneself. You can't poor from an empty cup.\n\nOP didn't know what he could do if he stayed, so I pointed out the obvious. \"Here are things you could do if you stayed\" also noted another obvious point, that he can't do them from away. So the overall obvious point, is that he could do a load more for her by staying.", "Correct, that is her right and decision to make. The whole passive aggressive thing is where it gets hostage-y.", "Which is her decision to make but as far as being TA It doesn't make OP that", "Yes, but by being there OP is still pouring from his cup.  To recharge you can't stay in the draining situation.    He clearly knows he can do those things.  It's within reason to say that we're seeing a self justification thought process with the whole \"I don't know what I can do\" schtick.", "Valuing your mental health? YTA", "> was valuing my mental health and I do regret it now.\n\nHere we go, you are now going the \"Excuse me for taking care of my mental health but\"\n\nYou were being selfish. You even said right here, that it wasn't her needs that were important, you would have only canceled if you knew it was make it or break it.\n\nYou should have stayed because she needed you, not to avoid any uncomfortable consequences FOR YOU.\n\nYouyouyou.\n\nShe might have said she didn't care because after you insisting many times that you were going despite the fact that she needed you there during a very hard time, because at that point she decided that she couldn't afford to care anymore.", "Oh it definitely does. She didn\u2019t want him to go. She went through a horribly traumatic miscarriage which most likely was bloody and terrible. She was informed she\u2019d never be able to have kids without medical intervention. He knew she had previous trauma earlier in her life which has contributed to this inability to carry to term. That\u2019s a lot for a few months let alone two weeks. Any man I know who had that much blood come out of his system definitely would need support and caretaking. Why do you think it\u2019s ok for him to skip out on being her emotional support and then being \u201csurprised\u201d she suddenly needs space? Plus his comments are horrible.", "He clearly said he didn't know. Also his reason for going was because of the conversation he had, \"I'm not a mind reader\" and \"it's already paid for\". It was never \"I need time to be away from it all\". If that was the case, then the first part of my first comment holds true."]}
