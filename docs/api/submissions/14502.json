So this was somewhat a miracle baby and we were both fully prepared to have this baby, until she unfortunately miscarried\u2026it was really horrible to say the least. She fell into a depression and I was sad too.  \n\n2 weeks later, I had a trip planned for my brothers bachelor\u2019s party. This was planned way before we even found out she was pregnant.  She told me how she didn\u2019t want me to go and that she still needs me but I wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted me to do if I stayed, I told her I will be back in 3 days and she seemed fine with that answer because she gave me the go ahead. The day I was leaving she asked me \u201c are you seriously actually going to go\u201d and I told her I had too since the ticket and hotel is non refundable. So I did end up going. \n\nThe whole trip I barley herd from her and I tried calling her and she just ignored me, I came home from the trip, to our apartment and all of her stuff was gone and she took my dog and dropped it off over my parents house. I went to my moms house and picked up my dog and she told me my girlfriend dropped the dog off, because she couldn\u2019t watch it and she needed space from me\u2026 I told my mom what happened and she told me I was idiot and an asshole for what I did. I don\u2019t believe what I did was wrong by going on this trip she told me I could go, I tried calling her to sort this out because I love her and i just been ignored so far\u2026 so AITA?\n\nEdit: yes sorry for the typo I\u2019m a male, typo I\u2019m at work and she told me point blank that I could go.\n\nSecond edit: I get it my spelling sucks I wrote this at work, second I\u2019m not blaming my gf for me going to Vegas. I\u2019m just simply saying she gave me an okay that I thought at that time she truly didn\u2019t care. Lastly, saying remarks regarding that her having a miscarriage was the best thing that could happen is extremely hurtful. You can say I\u2019m an asshole without saying that.\n\nUPDATE: I appreciate the feedback ( even though very harsh) and I know I\u2019m definitely in the wrong.

You didn't choose the person who was struggling after the miscarriage. You chose to go to the bachelor party. You made choices that lead her to make choices of her own.", "YTA.

Your girlfriend finds out about a surprise pregnancy with your baby and then has a miscarriage and you go right off on a trip to a bachelor party (think strippers and all that) saying you have to because your hotel etc are non-refundable....after she asked you NOT to go because she needed you at this time. Sure she then told you to go, but you knew she really wanted you there.  One man to another, I gotta tell you that is really not cool.   I wouldn't blame her if she decides not to take you back.", "YTA - she clearly wanted you to stay as emotional support for the trauma she just went through, and you blew her off to go to a bachelor party. Your mom is right. YTA.", "YTA she lost a baby she never thought she\u2019d have and you left her bc the trip was paid for! She told you to go but parents that actually love their unborn and lost child often go through depression and don\u2019t say what they are feeling. Something you clearly don\u2019t know  about bc you are over it like child didn\u2019t mean anything to you. Yes you were sad but over it  just in time for your trip. How convenient.

Also leave her alone your not entitled to speak to her after you left her to have fun.", "I\u2019m going with soft YTA because she told you to go even though she didn\u2019t want you to go.  I hate it when people do this kind of thing like it\u2019s some kind of test.  She should have stated her real opinion and you should have asked her your questions instead of just wondering and hoping.  I get that you felt this was an important thing for your brother but it wasn\u2019t like it was the wedding and you could have skipped it.  It would have been best to talk to your brother or mom or get an outside opinion and perspective BEFORE the trip.  Because you prioritized a fun trip over your grieving girlfriend it makes you TA even though she said you could go.  Has she not given permission it would have been a solid YTA\nEdit to add that I am a woman and changed the word women to people so people will focus on the fact that I actually said he\u2019s TA either way and not be mad that I said women instead of SO\u2019s.", "INFO: your post indicates you\u2019re both female so I\u2019m curious what your relationship dynamic is. Is there a male third, open relationship, etc.? Or was it just a typo?", "NTA \n\nShe has the right to grieve and be sad as she went through something traumatic. Everybody grieves at their own pace and just because you were feeling up to go doesn\u2019t mean she was in a better place. That doesn\u2019t give her the right to just ignore you and give you the silent treatment. That\u2019s childish and doesn\u2019t solve anything. If she were to have said, \u201cI\u2019m hurt by what you did. I need some time to figure things out so I\u2019m moving my things. Please don\u2019t call/text me for *insert time here*. I\u2019ll reach out after that and if I need more time I\u2019ll say so.\u201d That would be way more mature and helpful. Grief can be a strange thing that everybody does different but if she said you could go and then wanted you to stay but then refuses to talk to you when you get back that\u2019s a whole bunch of mixed signals that would be confusing to anybody. It probably would be a good idea to talk to a couples counselor together.", "I think NTA only because she told you it was fine to go. Miscarriages are very hard emotionally but she gave you the OK. If she can't communicate her needs you can't help her properly. But it sounds like your gf was told it would be difficult to create a baby without help, not impossible. You both really should learn the difference between sterile and \"might have fertility issues in the future\" because I'm guessing you weren't being safe at all because you thought \"whoohoo she can't get knocked up so no condoms for me\"", "YTA - even the best relationships sometimes end due to loss, and you destabilized yours needlessly. She didn\u2019t trap you either. From your own admission, your girlfriend was very clear that she didn\u2019t want you to go (remember you said \u201cit was really horrible to say the least\u201d ?!) and you pushed it. What else did you need to hear from her? Of course she inevitably said that it was your choice. And of course when you made the choice that deeply hurt her, she made her own choice to establish a boundary while she processes all of this. I am so sorry for the multiple things she is now grieving about.", "ESH, because it appears you both never actually had a grown up conversation about each other's wants and needs.", "Yeah I\u2019ve heard I can\u2019t get pregnant before too. Now I have a daughter. \n\nI would have gone tho, that\u2019s your brother. Pretty sure your bro will always be there for you. No guarantee w romantic relationships. \n\nNta", "You are both women and she got pregnant? Uhhhh\u2026", "Edit: I\u2019m a fool who missed out on the part that she had a miscarriage. YTA op. \n\nNTA. She hasn\u2019t has the child yet nor is she heavily pregnant. I don\u2019t see why she can\u2019t take care of herself for three days, she\u2019s a grown woman. Personally, I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. Sounds like an overreaction on her part.", "NAH, though you could/should have done a little more to accommodate her mental health needs.  In a perfect world, you'd have arranged for someone you both trust (maybe one of your parents or a neighbour that's also had a miscarriage in the past?) to stay with her while you're gone, not just to help her with responsibilities and routines, but even just to talk about stuff she's struggling with that she feels unable to bring up with you.  You had over a week to make calls and plans, but being short sighted and a little thoughtless does not equate to being malicious.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is just how personal carrying a child is.  Sure, everyone in the family is excited, but the mother(/surrogate) is the one sustaining them, living with every movement they make.  You start to talk to the foetus, asking yourself all kinds of questions.  What will they look like?  Will they be introverted or extraverted?  What will their favourite food be?  How old will they be when they have their real first kiss?  You get EXTREMELY attached, EXTREMELY quickly and...  that's all ripped away, with no notice, for no reason.  I think it's extremely telling that she asked your parents to take care of the dog, she likely doesn't trust herself to keep ANYTHING alive right now and needs someone(s) to help her through that.", "NTA.  Miscarriages are shitty. I went through my fair share of it.  I'm also assuming this happened early on in the pregnancy.  Your already planned trip was for your brothers bachelor party. It has also been two weeks after the miscarriage. You would only be gone three days. Your gf has the right to grieve as long as she needs but I think in this circumstances, she needs to be understanding and let you go.", "YTA for not using protection.  You da man for calling her on her \u201cyou can go\u201d that really means \u201cyou can\u2019t go\u201d bullshit.

It's funny, recently I saw a post on here (and I even joined in commenting my experience) where a woman who went through a miscarriage was deemed the asshole because she used the circumstance to unfairly demand a lot of everyone around her (or something like that, I don't remember the full details). \n\nI'm a woman who has had multiple miscarriages. I understand it is absolutely devastating and causes a lot of awful feelings, but it sounds like you both were failing to communicate. \n\nYou interpreted her likely exasperated/sarcastic comment as a \"yes, go\", and she also chose to communicate in that way instead of a more serious sit down (although, I'll admit it's unclear how level headed of a conversation you guys had).\n\nImagine the conversation went like this: she says she needs support, and feels uncomfortable with you being away for so long. You could have expressed support. You could have said, \"this is so devastating to me too, and I can't even imagine what you're going through. I know it's a really difficult decision to make, but my brother is so important to me too, and I want to be there for him during this once in a lifetime event. Is there any way we can compromise? Maybe I could come home one day early, I can promise to check in on you at multiple set times, I can help you plan a fun weekend for yourself with your friends or family, I'll pay for a spa day for you, I'll facetime you before bed each night.\" Etc. \n\nFrankly it sounds like you waited for the first \"out\", the first hint of \"I guess she gave up\" and then kinda ignored the subject until it was time to go. Maybe she didn't bring it up again because she is scared to confront you. \n\nI do think that you're likely way way more TA than her. It's entirely possible that she did try to have a reasonable conversation with you and you shut her out entirely. But based on the information in your post, it sounds like she also failed to communicate her specific needs, so she is slightly TA too. \n\nBefore anyone comes for me, let me again remind you that I'm a woman who's gone through this experience. I've also spent much of my life terrified to advocate for myself and my needs, which in some ways is like being TA, but to oneself. I wasted many years of my life tiptoing around others and never speaking up when I was hurting. I hope for her that she's able to continue to advocate for her needs, and I'm proud of her for packing up and leaving when she didn't feel like she was getting what she needed.

I\u2019m speaking from experience, having both been a young woman dating a man nearly 7 years old and then a woman dating a man nearly 7 years younger.

I think the closest you come to being an AH is from poor communication. I don\u2019t think she is an AH, but I also think she should have just communicated exactly how she felt and what she would do if you did go and why.

I've said this before and I'll say it again, to some people having a miscarriage is like being told you won the lottery, you start to be excited for the future with this once in a lifetime opportunity, and then someone tells you that you didn't actually win anything. There's no reason, no consolation prize, nothing. You just have to somehow go back to the reality that you never won the lottery and it's depressing as hell. Time is the only thing that heals those wounds. On that note- you said it had been two weeks. That is not enough time to heal the wounds, but it also isn't so soon that you can't be apart from each other. Her unwillingness to budge on you doing something you planned so far in advance, which was probably also a once in a lifetime opportunity being your brothers bachelor party, was very selfish of her. Why should you not be allowed to have some sort of mental wellness event that can help you forget about the miscarriage for a bit?

Many women bleed and are in pain for weeks. The hormone letdown is no joke. Some women even lactate after losing a pregnancy.

Many women are in agonizing physical pain, going through what is effectively labor all while feeling like they may have done something wrong to cause this and feeling betrayed by their own body.

Your body and hormones react to being pregnant and then not being pregnant. It takes time to get back to normal physically, whether it was 8 weeks into the pregnancy or 15. Where am I getting this information? Science. Lived experiences from women who have had miscarriages. A simple Google search could give you that info.\n\nAlso, if she wasn\u2019t anticipating that pregnancy could be a thing she should worry about, it\u2019s likely she was further along. You\u2019re more likely to explain away early pregnancy symptoms than to test if you think there\u2019s a low likelihood of pregnancy. To be fair, this is conjecture but a lot of women I know who had surprise pregnancies found out later because they were not testing at the first sign of pregnancy. Not all women have regular menstrual cycles so skipping a period isn\u2019t always cause for buying a test. Most of the women in my family had bleeding that resembled a period for months into their pregnancy so they wouldn\u2019t have even thought they skipped a period. Aside from that, it\u2019s easy to shrug off being extra tired and feeling nauseated or having sore boobs if you\u2019re not expecting to be pregnant.\n\nSo, regardless of how far along and what info OP gave, she was suffering physical side effects. Most women I know who had miscarriages, even early, described it as feeling like their body went into labor and were not physically recovered right away. OP also mentioned it was \u201creally horrible to say the least.\u201d Furthermore, if she was further into the pregnancy as I suspect she may have been, those physical effects are magnified and more severe.", "Yes I do agree, if his brother felt hurt that he didn\u2019t show up his emotions would\u2019ve been valid.

I say this because you need to have realistic expectations of how your GF is going to carry this trauma.\n\nThat being said though, you both need to take steps to heal and move forward with your lives. It's not reasonable to expect you to sit around and sulk with her for years until she starts to get past it. Not to mention, this is your loss too.

No it's not fully healed yet by any means, but you're past the initial shock. It's going to take much longer to heal and you can be expected to put your life on hold until that time. If she doesn't want to be alone, she should make some arrangements with her friends or go to her parents (which it sounds like she did anyway).\n\nI'm going to get crucified, but I don't think this was reasonable for GF to want you to skip the bachelor party to support her emotionally.

OP not going on the trip would not make a huge difference for the GF's mental health. On the other hand, it would make OP upset that he can't spend that time with his brother.\n\nAnd it really bothers me that so many people are okay with the GF being controlling. **Why does she get to decide that OP's feelings don't matter and OP isn't allowed to have this special experience with his brother? Why isn't OP allowed to decide?** Why is OP a horrible person for making his own choice and spending time with his family for a special, rare event that was already planned before this miscarriage happened?\n\nIt annoys me that the comments seem to not care about OP's feelings at all, like he isn't allowed to have feelings or an opinion. The only thing that matters is the GF's feelings, and if the GF doesn't want OP to go on the trip, that's that and it's her decision only. OP is not allowed to make a choice of his own. He's not allowed to be sad about missing out on a trip that means a lot to him.\n\n(Another thing is... did the GF offer to pay back the price for the non-refundable ticket?

That means, I assume, you are bleeding out bits of blood and tissue for up to TWO WEEKS. So that, plus some amount of pain. \n\n\\- At three weeks you take a pregnancy test, which might show you are still pregnant, in which case you move onto a medical or surgical abortion. \n\n\\- You might receive tables to be inserted vaginally to encourage the cervix to open and the fetal tissue to pass. \"The tablets usually begin to work within a few hours. You'll experience symptoms similar to a heavy period, such as cramping and heavy vaginal bleeding. You may also experience vaginal bleeding for up to *3 weeks.\"* (from the NHS)\n\n\\- Your bleeding may become so heavy you need to go back to the hospital \n\n\\- If you still don't pass the fetal tissue entirely after that, you need to go into surgery (an abortion procedure called a D&C). \n\nSo if OP means the miscarriage started two weeks ago, she may literally still be miscarrying and face possible complication, when he's ready to jet set to a party weekend. If he means the processed completed two weeks ago, well that could be two weeks after an extremely emotionally and labor intensive process.

So yes, I know a lot of grieving in different ways BUT its still a fact that its her body that goes through the hormonal and physical change, diminishing that does not make anything better. Its okay that sometimes one part has the bigger need and its a part of life to realize that and act on it. He writes that her condition was because of terrible things happening in the past, that means she has a vulnerability there, she has already heard that she will most certainly not get pregnant and have a child the old fashioned way, she gets pregnant, she has to realize that first and work that out when her body also changes. Thats a great lot to cope with. Then she misscarriages and he let her down big time and then we should excuse him because he is also in mourning? \nI don't buy that. Sometimes you have to be the bigger person, be the strong one and yes, this is unfair maybe but that is his job and when she feels better he can take his turn to work things out. What if they already had children? And someone died? Should he go away then too? So he can mourn that in Vegas with strippers, booze and guys night out? You cant get 50/50 all the time and then the one with the bigger need gets the time and effort. Thats how you grow a relationship, not skipping away to a bachelor party and think 2 weeks is enough time to mourn the big thing you thought you would never have.

She asked for him to be there for her. Not even necessarily to the exclusion of other support networks in her life. He decided that her expressing this need wasn\u2019t enough for him to stay. I think that she was 100% in the right to decide that this was a dealbreaker for her.\n\nI also want to point out that this has two extra layers. A miscarriage is AWFUL no matter what. But OPs ex thought she\u2019d never get pregnant naturally before this. Now she\u2019s probably going through all the usual feelings of blame and self-doubt on top of the fact that she likely feels as though she may have missed her only \u201cmiracle\u201d opportunity to conceive and carry a biological child. On top of THAT her suspected fertility issues stem from a traumatic past experience. That means the past trauma is probably bubbling to the surface in the midst of alll this.\n\nYes, she needs other support. She shouldn\u2019t rely 100% on her partner. Yes, she should have therapy to process all the aforementioned issues. It wouldn\u2019t be fair of her to put this all on her partner and expect him to be her therapist. But two weeks out, I think it\u2019s entirely reasonable for her to ask him to be physically present with her while she\u2019s grieving.\n\nI would have felt differently if he was going out for dinner/drinks with friends in town.

I\u2019m sorry but she should have put her own feelings aside for this one time and let you enjoy yourself. Everyone handles grief differently and you shouldn\u2019t be punished because you recovered faster emotionally. Also what if this relationship doesn\u2019t work out later on and you missed out on your brother\u2019s joyous time? Kind of foolish in my option. She weaponized her feelings. Sorry to say.", "Thank god for that. Imagine having a mother this emotionally fragile. Yuck, no thanks.", "Life-long memories? Of what? Getting drunk, gambling, leering (or worse) at strippers? Please.", "If OP didn't care for her, they wouldn't have been in a relationship in the first place and he sure as hell wouldnt have been with her for the two weeks after a miscarriage but he was.\n\nAlso why would she outrank him on his list of priorities? Why does her health outweigh his?\n\nHe obviously didn't outrank her on her list of priorities either so all is fair.\n\nAlso this situation does not translate to caring for a child in any way shape or form, this is two adults grieving in their own ways. \n\nUnless you're insinuating that the GF is acting like a child and OP just messed up parenting rule #1.", "I didn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t care for her at all. I said he didn\u2019t care for her enough to be a life partner and coparent with her. Different.\n\nAlso, the person in a relationship with a traumatic past going through a physical and emotional trauma SHOULD have their needs met by their partner. It\u2019s not that his emotional grief doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s that he should be worried about her based on both her past and the physical and emotional toll this took on her. Especially considering she is worried that this may have been her first and last pregnancy. The fact that anything else is on his mind but being with her in her grief and pain is mind boggling to me. IMO, that\u2019s a person who has a lot of maturing to do and/or didn\u2019t find the right person to be his partner yet. Idk which. But either way, relationships shouldn\u2019t be about keeping score or what is objectively \u201cfair\u201d all the time. Sometimes your partner needs extra from you, sometimes you need extra from them. If you care more about \u201cfairness\u201d than meeting the needs of the person you love, maybe you need to take a hard look at your priorities in life. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "And it translates to caring for a child in the sense that you need a true partnership to effectively coparent. At different times each partner may need to support the other one more for a period of time. It\u2019s not always going to be a 50-50 split. Parenting is HARD and stressful and there will be times that they need to work together as a team to do what\u2019s best for each other and their child. \n\nFinding someone to be the parent to your child should be about finding someone you can rely on in hard times, not just someone around who can enjoy the good times. An adult who thinks it\u2019s appropriate to prioritize a Vegas bachelor party while his SO is home reeling from very recently losing a wanted pregnancy and asking for him to stay to support her is not an adult ready for the partnership and empathy required to be a reliable coparent.", ">the person in a relationship with a traumatic past going through a physical and emotional trauma SHOULD have their needs met by their partner.\n\nDo you expect OP to hold her hand through every single part of her grieving process?\n\nI'd like to think not, considering that wouldn't be healthy for either of them, both physically and emotionally.\n\nPerhaps OP's needs weren't being met by GF and he looked at the trip as a source for those needs to be met?\n\nI obviously wouldn't blame her for not being able to meet his needs giving their situation but I'm also not going to blame him for not being able to meet her needs because it's their situation too.\n\nIt's also not about being fair or keeping score but understanding that not every situation in a relationship has  a compromise and that it usually ends up with both parties doing what's best for themselves and no one is to blame for the actions both before and after.\n\nYour whole sometimes one takes extra, another time the other takes some extra sounds very fragile because eventually someone will take too much and it arguably has a \"fair\" baseline.", "Do I expect OP to hold her hand through every single part of her grieving process? Yes, I do. If he wants to be in a relationship with her and cares about her well-being. \n\nMiscarriages are bad enough. Adding onto this the fact that she previously thought she couldn\u2019t get pregnant and was thrilled at the prospect of this miracle pregnancy, knowing it may have been her only shot at becoming a mother naturally. Then considering the fact that her suspected fertility issues are a result of a traumatic past that is now bubbling to the surface? Yeah, I\u2019d say if he loves her he should be present with her in her grief. \n\nIf there\u2019s a conversation to be had about his needs or him getting away for some time to himself while she is still processing and grieving, I\u2019d say TWO WEEKS is certainly not enough time to leave her alone for multiple days in my opinion. It\u2019s not like he went out for dinner and drinks with his friends - he hopped on a plane for a weekend of fun where he wouldn\u2019t be easily reachable and expected her to just sit around in her own grief after she expressed that she needed him in that moment. His ex girlfriend seems to agree and has hopefully decided that he is not the partner she needs in this life."]}
