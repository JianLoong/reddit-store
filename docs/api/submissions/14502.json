Especially when it was from a pregnancy they thought they would never be able to have. \n\nGood for her for calling you out, and setting up boundaries for when you get back.

That's not enough to make your ego big, what was she thinking?\n\nYou're right -- this IS all her fault.\n\nWhy don't you officially break up with her and let her heal from her miscarriage by herself.

I\u2019m pretty sure, depending on what actual words she used and tone of voice, that she really didn\u2019t tell you to go and mean it. Leaving your girlfriend for a 3 day trip after she suffered a very traumatic incident was an asshole move for sure.", "While you may have asked to still go, she wanted you to make the choice of choosing her. You didn't choose the person who was struggling after the miscarriage. You chose to go to the bachelor party. You made choices that lead her to make choices of her own.", "YTA. But you already know that don't you.", "YTA. Dude, you F-ed up big time. Your girlfriend finds out about a surprise pregnancy with your baby and then has a miscarriage and you go right off on a trip to a bachelor party (think strippers and all that) saying you have to because your hotel etc are non-refundable....after she asked you NOT to go because she needed you at this time. Sure she then told you to go, but you knew she really wanted you there.  One man to another, I gotta tell you that is really not cool.   I wouldn't blame her if she decides not to take you back.", "YTA - she clearly wanted you to stay as emotional support for the trauma she just went through, and you blew her off to go to a bachelor party. Your mom is right. YTA.", "YTA she lost a baby she never thought she\u2019d have and you left her bc the trip was paid for! She told you to go but parents that actually love their unborn and lost child often go through depression and don\u2019t say what they are feeling. Something you clearly don\u2019t know  about bc you are over it like child didn\u2019t mean anything to you. Yes you were sad but over it  just in time for your trip. How convenient. I feel so sorry for her that she had to discover this way how horrible of a partner you would have been.", "Dude. You're a stone's throw away from 30 fucking years old and you really need us to spell out in the comments why YTA?", "She just lost a baby. Asked you not to go.

You left her during a time that she was struggling, AFTER she straight up told you she still needs you\u2026. Like, read between the lines here a little bit! Read the room!", "Sir YTA, she tried to tell you how she felt and you quite literally neglected her feelings\u2026 she most likely experienced some trauma as kid, hence why this probably opened up an old wound. Also leave her alone your not entitled to speak to her after you left her to have fun.", "I\u2019m going with soft YTA because she told you to go even though she didn\u2019t want you to go.  I hate it when people do this kind of thing like it\u2019s some kind of test.  She should have stated her real opinion and you should have asked her your questions instead of just wondering and hoping.  I get that you felt this was an important thing for your brother but it wasn\u2019t like it was the wedding and you could have skipped it.  It would have been best to talk to your brother or mom or get an outside opinion and perspective BEFORE the trip.  Because you prioritized a fun trip over your grieving girlfriend it makes you TA even though she said you could go.  Has she not given permission it would have been a solid YTA\nEdit to add that I am a woman and changed the word women to people so that feminists don\u2019t get their hackles up because they don\u2019t like what I said even though they agree with my judgment.", "INFO: your post indicates you\u2019re both female so I\u2019m curious what your relationship dynamic is. Is there a male third, open relationship, etc.? Or was it just a typo?", "NTA \n\nShe has the right to grieve and be sad as she went through something traumatic. Everybody grieves at their own pace and just because you were feeling up to go doesn\u2019t mean she was in a better place. That doesn\u2019t give her the right to just ignore you and give you the silent treatment. That\u2019s childish and doesn\u2019t solve anything. If she were to have said, \u201cI\u2019m hurt by what you did. I need some time to figure things out so I\u2019m moving my things. Please don\u2019t call/text me for *insert time here*. I\u2019ll reach out after that and if I need more time I\u2019ll say so.\u201d That would be way more mature and helpful. Grief can be a strange thing that everybody does different but if she said you could go and then wanted you to stay but then refuses to talk to you when you get back that\u2019s a whole bunch of mixed signals that would be confusing to anybody. It probably would be a good idea to talk to a couples counselor together.", "I think NTA only because she told you it was fine to go. Miscarriages are very hard emotionally but she gave you the OK. If she can't communicate her needs you can't help her properly. But it sounds like your gf was told it would be difficult to create a baby without help, not impossible. You both really should learn the difference between sterile and \"might have fertility issues in the future\" because I'm guessing you weren't being safe at all because you thought \"whoohoo she can't get knocked up so no condoms for me\"", "YTA - even the best relationships sometimes end due to loss, and you destabilized yours needlessly. She didn\u2019t trap you either. From your own admission, your girlfriend was very clear that she didn\u2019t want you to go (remember you said \u201cit was really horrible to say the least\u201d ?!) and you pushed it. What else did you need to hear from her? Of course she inevitably said that it was your choice. And of course when you made the choice that deeply hurt her, she made her own choice to establish a boundary while she processes all of this. I am so sorry for the multiple things she is now grieving about.", "ESH, because it appears you both never actually had a grown up conversation about each other's wants and needs.", "Yeah I\u2019ve heard I can\u2019t get pregnant before too. Now I have a daughter. \n\nI would have gone tho, that\u2019s your brother. Pretty sure your bro will always be there for you. No guarantee w romantic relationships. \n\nNta", "You are both women and she got pregnant? Uhhhh\u2026", "Edit: I\u2019m a fool who missed out on the part that she had a miscarriage. YTA op. \n\nNTA. She hasn\u2019t has the child yet nor is she heavily pregnant. I don\u2019t see why she can\u2019t take care of herself for three days, she\u2019s a grown woman. Personally, I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. Sounds like an overreaction on her part.", "NAH, though you could/should have done a little more to accommodate her mental health needs.  In a perfect world, you'd have arranged for someone you both trust (maybe one of your parents or a neighbour that's also had a miscarriage in the past?) to stay with her while you're gone, not just to help her with responsibilities and routines, but even just to talk about stuff she's struggling with that she feels unable to bring up with you.  You had over a week to make calls and plans, but being short sighted and a little thoughtless does not equate to being malicious.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is just how personal carrying a child is.  Sure, everyone in the family is excited, but the mother(/surrogate) is the one sustaining them, living with every movement they make.  You start to talk to the foetus, asking yourself all kinds of questions.  What will they look like?  Will they be introverted or extraverted?  What will their favourite food be?  How old will they be when they have their real first kiss?  You get EXTREMELY attached, EXTREMELY quickly and...  that's all ripped away, with no notice, for no reason.  I think it's extremely telling that she asked your parents to take care of the dog, she likely doesn't trust herself to keep ANYTHING alive right now and needs someone(s) to help her through that.", "NTA.  Miscarriages are shitty. I went through my fair share of it.  I'm also assuming this happened early on in the pregnancy.  Your already planned trip was for your brothers bachelor party. It has also been two weeks after the miscarriage. You would only be gone three days. Your gf has the right to grieve as long as she needs but I think in this circumstances, she needs to be understanding and let you go.", "YTA for not using protection.  You da man for calling her on her \u201cyou can go\u201d that really means \u201cyou can\u2019t go\u201d bullshit.  When a man does that to a woman, he\u2019s called controlling and manipulative by the Redditverse. And I agree with that, and it goes both ways.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If I told my husband I needed him and then he basically said, \u201cwell, I don\u2019t know what I could do for you, so I should just be able to go off and do what I want,\u201d I wouldnt sit there and argue either. She didn\u2019t just get all quiet and meekly agree that he should go or that she agreed with his reasons. She told him she didn\u2019t care and to just go, probably because he made it clear that his mind was made up and even telling him that she needed him didn\u2019t matter. You can\u2019t say you didn\u2019t understand what someone needed when they straight up told you and you chose to push the issue anyway so you could get what you want.", "You  qualified your comment to say that he was a soft YTA because she said he could go. I am pointing out that your qualification was correct, because he indeed did not have a green light. He said it in the comments on the top comment.

Way too old for you to fake naivete about this.", "Your girlfriend, who believed she'd never be able to conceive, miscarried, and you think after two weeks, she should be over it. After you acknowledge that she was in \"a deep depression.\"\n\nYTA, absolutely. You refused to change your plans after she told you more than once that she needed you, and when she throws up her hands and says, \"Just go then,\" you pretend that this didn't mean she was giving up because you were refusing to consider her needs.\n\nShe was right to leave you.", "You knew 3 days qould make a difference because she told you it would. Why didn't you take her at her word when she made it clear she needed you, but decided to take her at her word when she finally gave up. You don't get to play dumb here. She made it clear, you blew her feelings off, she knew she couldn't stop you, so she gave up.\n\n Actions have consequences. Action: You went when younwere well aware she needed you. Consequence: She realizes you aren't a reliable, caring partner.\n\nNo many times you say you took her at her word, we all know that is BS b/c you didn't bother to take her at her word the entire time she asked you to stay.", "Well if her miscarriage was an whole two weeks ago, then, yeah, of course she would be completely fine. I mean, I can\u2019t imagine that taking more than a day or two to get over something like that. \n\nSince you \u201caren\u2019t a mind reader,\u201d I\u2019m going to spell this out for you: I\u2019m being sarcastic. Honestly I cannot fully wrap my head around your lack of empathy. It is very hard for me to understand how someone could think like you.", "oh my god bro stop playing dumb. you knew exactly what she meant when she said i don\u2019t care just go. god, you act like my dad. YTA.", "Which is exactly why I said he was TA. But even when you give up - you shouldn\u2019t say fine go then/ you stand your ground and tell them they are being obtuse/unreasonable. Women get a bad rap because when they stand their ground they are \u201cputting their foot down\u201d and I actually got the nickname \u201cThe Foot\u201d from my husband\u2019s friends because I spoke my mind.

YOU just told her what she meant to you. \n\nYES, OP=YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou are completely daft, obviously fairly uneducated (multiple spelling mistakes), and abandoned your girlfriend right after an extremely traumatic medical event.

I hope she comes to her senses and ditches you because she deserves a real man who will step up when the time comes to support her when a tragic event occurs, not someone like you.", "INFO: what childhood trauma resulted into her being infertile?", "Unpopular ESH response. It's funny, recently I saw a post on here (and I even joined in commenting my experience) where a woman who went through a miscarriage was deemed the asshole because she used the circumstance to unfairly demand a lot of everyone around her (or something like that, I don't remember the full details). \n\nI'm a woman who has had multiple miscarriages. I understand it is absolutely devastating and causes a lot of awful feelings, but it sounds like you both were failing to communicate. \n\nYou interpreted her likely exasperated/sarcastic comment as a \"yes, go\", and she also chose to communicate in that way instead of a more serious sit down (although, I'll admit it's unclear how level headed of a conversation you guys had).\n\nImagine the conversation went like this: she says she needs support, and feels uncomfortable with you being away for so long. You could have expressed support. You could have said, \"this is so devastating to me too, and I can't even imagine what you're going through. I know it's a really difficult decision to make, but my brother is so important to me too, and I want to be there for him during this once in a lifetime event. Is there any way we can compromise? Maybe I could come home one day early, I can promise to check in on you at multiple set times, I can help you plan a fun weekend for yourself with your friends or family, I'll pay for a spa day for you, I'll facetime you before bed each night.\" Etc. \n\nFrankly it sounds like you waited for the first \"out\", the first hint of \"I guess she gave up\" and then kinda ignored the subject until it was time to go. Maybe she didn't bring it up again because she is scared to confront you. \n\nI do think that you're likely way way more TA than her. It's entirely possible that she did try to have a reasonable conversation with you and you shut her out entirely. But based on the information in your post, it sounds like she also failed to communicate her specific needs, so she is slightly TA too. \n\nBefore anyone comes for me, let me again remind you that I'm a woman who's gone through this experience. I've also spent much of my life terrified to advocate for myself and my needs, which in some ways is like being TA, but to oneself. I wasted many years of my life tiptoing around others and never speaking up when I was hurting. I hope for her that she's able to continue to advocate for her needs, and I'm proud of her for packing up and leaving when she didn't feel like she was getting what she needed. From the post it just seems like they both did too much \"assuming my partner can read my mind and will intuit my needs.\"", "Are you TA for going? No you do need to look after yourself and your own happiness and mental health too. You can't pour from an empty cup.\n\nAre you TA for going based on your conversation with her? A bit, yeah. No you're not a mind reader, but you don't need to be when she already expressed she needed you there.\n\n\"I already paid for the ticket and hotel\" so if you go, do you get your money back? Money is gone either way. That's a financial loss regardless. Of you choose to stay and be there for her, you've already spent the money. If you go on the trip, you've already spent the money. \n\n\"Idk what I would do for her if I stayed\" you could be there. Listen. Talk. Be there the bounce off. Empathise. Make her tea and just be present. So in essence, loads. What could you do for her on the trip? Text. Wow. Call. Super.", "NAH, you likely benefitted from the time with your brother. It\u2019s awful what the two of you experienced, but self-care is important in addressing it. Sorry man.", "YTA dude. You can\u2019t say that you didn\u2019t know what she meant here.
