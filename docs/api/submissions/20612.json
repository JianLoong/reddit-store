Not in any way, OP. This young man will have a rude awakening if he continues to get aggressive when people tell him no.", "NTA - you were looking out for your horse. You're absolutely right, it's your horse and the answer is no. Period.\n\nHilarious that they called you entitled because projection lol. You do not have to 'share' fucking anything with them. You offered a different horse if he really wanted to ride but the thing is, it had to be YOUR horse. They're trying to walk on you and you didn't allow it. Keep that shit up. You do not have to do or allow anything that makes you uncomfortable or violates your boundaries for anyone. Blood or not. Your time, energy, life, things, animals, etc. Are yours and yours alone. Access to anything of yours is a privilege not a right. Shut those motherfuckers down and know you did right and keep it up. Doesn't matter whose voice it is telling you otherwise, you did good by you and your animal.", "NTA, and if I were you, I would either move your horse to a different farm or install a camera in your horses stall. As entitled as your cousin is , I would not put it past him or your aunt, or parents to let him ride another time without your permission- or to harm your horse in someway. I hate to think that way, but your horse can\u2019t tell you if he\u2019s been harmed. Good luck OP.", "NTA - Any 15 year old who demands he rides your horse instead of politely asking deserves to be told no. Then your cousin goes whining to his mommy deserves a second no. Don\u2019t listen to your family & apologize.  You love your horse and have their best interests in mind.", "NTA.\n\nThe fact that your cousin was determined to ride YOUR horse when there were others there tells you what malice is involved here. He wants what you have, and he will destroy it if he can.\n\nI hope there is someplace safe you can place your horse in--another farm?--because cousin isn't finished with this yet.\n\nI also think that when his flying monkeys gang up on you you should make it so verbally unpleasant for them that they decide not to die on that hill and might even tell him to give up. Short of that, they have nothing to lose by fighting with you.\n\nAnd you should go permanently NC with that cousin and his mother.\n\nA horse is not a toy.", "NTA for protecting your horse. \n\nThe cousin could have ridden the other horse but he just did not like that you told him No.", "NTA\n\nYou are responsible for that horse\u2019s wellbeing & care.", "NTA", "NTA.

Nephew just wanted to get his way, and you are protecting your horse. \n\nYour \"attitude\" had nothing to do with ruining the family reunion. Your nephew wasn't respecting your wishes, and tried to push you into relenting. You know your horse--he doesn't.\n\nIf this is the reason your family is giving for dissolving the reunion, it wasn't much of a reunion to begin with.", "Completely NTA. If he pushes your horse harder than your horse is used to (a not uncommon trait with spoiled young men with cars, horses, motorbikes etc) and your horse breaks down or suffers an injury we all know neither he nor his asshole parents will pay the vet bills. Or replace the horse if it needed to be euthanized. You\u2019re 30 years old. Your word is law when it comes to your property. I honestly do not know what in the fuck is wrong with people. NTA.  \n\nPS I would not let him ride the other horse either with that attitude.", "NTA.  Your job is to protect your pet.  Tell the kid -- and all the other family members -- to piss off!\n\nDon't be bullied.  You are responsible for his care.  Think about how you will feel if this entitled sh\\*t looks at you, runs your horse and he is injured or gets sick?  Do you think the kid or your aunt will show any remorse whatsoever?  Will they pay the vet bills?", "No way. NO WAY. God knows what cretin would have done to the horse, just because he felt like it. He could have injured or even killed him. The horse trusts you to keep him safe, and he would not have been safe with cretin. Of course, a little horse stomp might have done cretin a world of good! I don't think horse is safe now, with a thwarted cretin, as said. Can you tell his parents that if anything happens to horse, the police will be called on cretin?", "NTA. First off it\u2019s your horse nobody else\u2019s. So nobody else gets a say. Secondly you\u2019re making sure your horse doesn\u2019t get hurt and you know what\u2019s best for your horse. Thirdly he\u2019s a new rider who will probably try to work your horse more than they should be. Plus as the horse gets older who knows if he\u2019s really ok with \u201cnew\u201d people riding him. Last but not least you gave him another option and he refused it. As far as I\u2019m concerned him and everyone else can kick rocks. He\u2019s gonna get a rude wake up call when he does something stupid (break the law) and actually has to take accountability for what he\u2019s done.", "nta, it\u2019s your horse who you are around all the time. you know your horse, they don\u2019t. sounds like the child is an entitled brat and needs to be told *no*.", "NTA - someone has to say no to him sometime. Your horse is a living being - not a toy. Yes, you are a grown woman who can make her own decisions and shouldn't be badgered by family.", "Completely NTA. You have every right to not have your horse messed up by other riders. You offered him a chance to ride, so anyone who insists that you should give him your personal horse can start lining up to let him drive their cars as soon as he gets a licence.", "NTA Your family is wrong for their expectations of you letting your cousin ride your horse. They should be apologizing to you.", "NTA. He is an AH.", "Every one of these stories sounds the same at this point", "NTA", "NTA - it\u2019s your horse. \n\nBUT - you need to get a vet out if at 15 your horse is exhibiting signs of being old. 15 year old horses in good health are still more than capable of competing, and quite a few at Grand Prix level which is incredibly demanding. Horses usually start slowing down around 18 but there have been some examples of even 18 year olds competing at the highest levels. A healthy 15 year old horse should be more than capable to withstand almost anything a beginner rider can throw at them as far as athleticism is concerned. It is a whole other story that you don\u2019t want other people riding your horse - I don\u2019t let anyone ride my horse. But fitness at 15 should not be an issue in a healthy horse.", "NTA and good for you for championing your beloved horse's well being! ESPECIALLY when there was a younger horse there for him to ride! I hope your family realizes their mistake and apologizes to you soon.", "You behaved entirely correctly. Your cousin is a whiny baby and your aunt is responsible for it. \n\nNot trusting a new rider who is also an entitled 15 y/o boy to ride your elderly horse is totally reasonable. The rest of your family might not even realize they're enabling them by being so conflict avoidant. \n\nNTA", "NTA... you are a responsible pet owner. You have a family of enablers. Glad you stood your ground.\n\nAnd that is how you say NO!\n\nIt's a superpower knowing how to say no.", "All of the above and wanted to add: cousin and aunt ruined the family reunion, not you", "I didn\u2019t considered that\u2026 Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have anywhere else to put him and I don\u2019t think my parents will authorise the cameras. I\u2019ll have to be clear with them that my cousin is absolutely not allowed near my sweetie\u2026", "I\u2019m waiting for the police to catch him riding the motorcycle he isn\u2019t supposed to. But with the way his parents behave, they will pay the tax and that will be it\u2026", "I agree. It\u2019s pretty common that horses own their people as much as the people own them. There\u2019s a level of trust that is pretty important for a rider to work well with a horse.", "I could just be a bit on the cautious side, just worried about your sweet horse! Good luck! hope it all works out. :)"]}
