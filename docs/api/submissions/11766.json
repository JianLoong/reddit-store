Nick was divorced and had three kids under the age of 5. Nick's ex had a lot of demons and died soon after my mom and Nick met. So Nick's three kids lived with us 100% of the time and mom stepped into the role of mom with them. My dad died and my big sister died before I was ever born. There's been a lot of complicated feelings and thoughts surrounding that but I am mostly okay with that. When mom and Nick got married they really tried to hype me up into this big sister role. My mom turned around and tried to tell me that I should be like my sister was, how excited she was to be a big sissy and how I should model myself after her loving affection for mom's bump, aka me, back then. I told her that was really unfair to throw at me. We argued. She told me my sister would have embraced them and wanted to be the best role model to them. My sister was 3 when she died, for those who will ask.\n\nI wasn't resistant to the idea of us being a family. But my actions were always called out for not being enough. But the timeline was too fast for more. Mom met Nick 7 months before she married him. We lived together for a whole month prior to the wedding. Within weeks of the marriage my mom and Nick were picking at how unloving and unhelpful I was to his kids. Mom would tell me to hold his youngest or why don't I ever offer to take them to the park behind our house. About four months after they got married Nick's oldest, who had just turned 5, fell and cut their knee. He was crying and my mom was cleaning him up and soothing him. He didn't want to go back out and play with his sister and I was drawing outside. Mom told me to give him a cuddle and kisses and get him back out playing. I said no. She said I should have rushed to pick him up and comfort him and I wasn't being a very good sister. Not too long after that incident Nick was angry that I wouldn't let his 4 year old sleep in my bed after a bad dream.\n\nThose expectations hung over me always. We ended up in therapy as a family when I was 15 and it ended when I was 16. Nothing improved or changed. Now I'm 18 and I moved out of the house and I have created some much needed distance between me and mom and her family. The kids miss me. Mom and Nick reached out via social media and said I need to make more of an effort to be involved in my siblings lives. I ignored them. Then mom and Nick showed up at my grandparents house and told me I signed up to be a sister and should have taken it far more seriously. That I had let down three kids who adore me and look up to me and who most of all need me. I told them I didn't sign up for anything and it's unfair to expect me to act like I signed a contract to be an affectionate, doting sibling who will jump to make them happy. They called me cruel and said the kids are innocent and I make it sound like they're a chore.\n\nAITA for what I said?", "created_utc": 1678267560, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lrscy/aita_for_arguing_that_i_didnt_sign_up_for/", "score": 279, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let your mom know how disappointed your dad would be if he saw how bad she treated you. I hope your grandparents always have your back. Good luck!", "ESH. Your mom and stepdad sound like they went about unitying the family the wrong way. These feelings and emotions are not something you can force upon people, especially kids.

I love my step siblings, as much as my real siblings. They are great people deserving of love. Have they ever done anything themselves to hurt you? if not, are you throwing the baby out with the bathwater because you are mad at your parents? They might be great supports as you move forward through the different stages of your life and you might be squandering that because you are mad at the expectation put on you?\n\nI still don't blame you for resenting the situation.

I hope your grandparents are able to provide that pillar of support that your mother and Nick neglected to give you.\n\nThat's not the point of therapy, and it's a shame the therapist didnt spend more time working directly with them to refine their expectations more. It was possibly a little premature to address the family dynamic before ensuring that everyone's expectations of the goals of therapy were consistent and benevolent. Parents who think its ok to use therapy as a tool to get their kids to comply are really missing the point and wasting the time of the therapist and their own resources.\n\nThat being said, maybe some individual therapy going forward might benefit you? It sounds like your needs have been neglected for a long time.
