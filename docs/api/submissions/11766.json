Nick was divorced and had three kids under the age of 5. Nick's ex had a lot of demons and died soon after my mom and Nick met. So Nick's three kids lived with us 100% of the time and mom stepped into the role of mom with them. My dad died and my big sister died before I was ever born. There's been a lot of complicated feelings and thoughts surrounding that but I am mostly okay with that. When mom and Nick got married they really tried to hype me up into this big sister role. My mom turned around and tried to tell me that I should be like my sister was, how excited she was to be a big sissy and how I should model myself after her loving affection for mom's bump, aka me, back then. I told her that was really unfair to throw at me. We argued. She told me my sister would have embraced them and wanted to be the best role model to them. My sister was 3 when she died, for those who will ask.\n\nI wasn't resistant to the idea of us being a family. But my actions were always called out for not being enough. But the timeline was too fast for more. Mom met Nick 7 months before she married him. We lived together for a whole month prior to the wedding. Within weeks of the marriage my mom and Nick were picking at how unloving and unhelpful I was to his kids. Mom would tell me to hold his youngest or why don't I ever offer to take them to the park behind our house. About four months after they got married Nick's oldest, who had just turned 5, fell and cut their knee. He was crying and my mom was cleaning him up and soothing him. He didn't want to go back out and play with his sister and I was drawing outside. Mom told me to give him a cuddle and kisses and get him back out playing. I said no. She said I should have rushed to pick him up and comfort him and I wasn't being a very good sister. Not too long after that incident Nick was angry that I wouldn't let his 4 year old sleep in my bed after a bad dream.\n\nThose expectations hung over me always. We ended up in therapy as a family when I was 15 and it ended when I was 16. Nothing improved or changed. Now I'm 18 and I moved out of the house and I have created some much needed distance between me and mom and her family. The kids miss me. Mom and Nick reached out via social media and said I need to make more of an effort to be involved in my siblings lives. I ignored them. Then mom and Nick showed up at my grandparents house and told me I signed up to be a sister and should have taken it far more seriously. That I had let down three kids who adore me and look up to me and who most of all need me. I told them I didn't sign up for anything and it's unfair to expect me to act like I signed a contract to be an affectionate, doting sibling who will jump to make them happy. They called me cruel and said the kids are innocent and I make it sound like they're a chore.\n\nAITA for what I said?", "created_utc": 1678267560, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lrscy/aita_for_arguing_that_i_didnt_sign_up_for/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom and Nick tried to rush you into a sibling-like relationship with kids you\u2019d just met. That\u2019s the WORST way to go about building a bond between step-siblings. Your mom is a major AH for using your deceased sister to try to guilt-trip you, and it seems as though guilt-tripping has been her only strategy for years on end and still is. That\u2019s a major AH flag. Stay as clear of them as you can.", "NTA\n\nSounds to me like they wanted someone readily available to pick up the slack for their lazy-ass parenting: making YOU comfort the kids and play with the kids and let them into your bed when they're scared. All that was THEIR job, not yours.", "NTA! Go no contact and I hope your in the path of healing. Your mom sounds awful because while she was probably a great stepmom to the kids she sound like she neglected you. Now she wants you to take care emotionally of those kids. Absolutely not! Let them know if they continue to harass you then you will call the police and file a report. Tell them you want nothing to do with that family. Let your mom know how disappointed your dad would be if he saw how bad she treated you. I hope your grandparents always have your back. Good luck!", "ESH. Your mom and stepdad sound like they went about unitying the family the wrong way. These feelings and emotions are not something you can force upon people, especially kids. From the post at least, it seemed like they were constantly nagging about it, which definitely would not have helped the situation.  \n\n\nAnd you suck OP, for not actually loving your siblings. It's all just excuses for not interacting with them. You're not pointing to any faults your siblings may've done, just that you were forced into being their sibling. That's no excuse to not be more warm to them.  \n\n\nNo judgment for your siblings. As they mostly seem like 3rd parties here.", "NTA\n\nIt's super unfair that you mum expected you to be like your late older sister. That's a guilt trippy way of getting you to conform rather than fostering a genuine relationship between her biological family and her found family. I don't blame her for wanting you to have a relationship but it's entirely the wrong way to go about it.\n\nI don't blame you either for not wanting to feel obligated to accept a role that was thrust upon you. You're right, you didn't choose to be a sister, and you made the mature decision to move out of a place you felt uncomfortable instead of hanging around and having constant low level conflict and bad vibes.\n\nThat said, are your siblings really so terrible? I love my step siblings, as much as my real siblings. They are great people deserving of love. Have they ever done anything themselves to hurt you? if not, are you throwing the baby out with the bathwater because you are mad at your parents? They might be great supports as you move forward through the different stages of your life and you might be squandering that because you are mad at the expectation put on you?\n\nI still don't blame you for resenting the situation. But direct your anger where it is deserved and not at your siblings.\n\nNTA", "No, it was only ever about what Nick's kids needed emotionally. Other than that it was just always picking on what I wasn't doing. Oh, you didn't offer to feed them lunch, oh you didn't offer them hugs, or you don't sit and cuddle them and watch movies, oh you didn't join in their movie night and you should have. That was all I ever seemed to get from them. From Nick I didn't care as much. But it hurt a lot hearing that from mom. Our relationship was gone in almost no time at all.", "They're not terrible. To be honest I don't really know them all that well. The expectations on me were too much and what I had been building in those very early days I just stopped because the expectations were never ending. I don't see a future where I love them or take on the role of their older sister though. No attachment formed and I don't know that I will have a relationship with my mom or her husband after this. I need the space to decide.", "I\u2019m so sorry about that. Some people meet a new partner and they just immediately prioritize that persons needs and wants over anyone else\u2019s. It sounds like your mom did this, and that\u2019s so unfair to you. And she will be telling people years from now she doesn\u2019t understand why you hardly ever see or talk to her?  Good luck in the future, you deserve happiness and I\u2019m sure you will find it.", "Take the space and the time. Do you think it's worth penning a letter to give to your mum when the time is right to explain how you feel? It sounds like she's had the blinkers on trying to get this new family to work, that she lost sight of the person who should be most important to her, which is her own daughter. I know you said you were in therapy but do you feel like you've ever had the chance to express exactly how you feel without them cutting you off or shifting priorities?\n\nIt would be a shame if she never gets a chance to understand and process what has happened outside of a heated discussion. But it sounds like either way time and space is what you need. Maybe one day there will be some resolution, but for now going LC/NC sounds like the least inflammatory course of action for all parties involved.", "She did. Or at the very least she put her new family's needs before mine. All she cared about was the happiness of her stepkids and never stopped to think the pressure on me was too much.", "No, I don't think it's worth doing that again. I was asked to do it in therapy and it did nothing. If anything it only made mom's expectations for me grow. She only grew more disappointed in what I wasn't doing for her stepkids.\n\nIn therapy itself I was often shut down and they just piled expectations on and shut the therapist(s) down. I was glad when therapy ended after a year for that very reason.", "Agreed. And she likely did that to please Nick.", "Yeah ok then it sounds like theyre jerks then. What's the point of going to therapy if you are just going to talk over the therapist and undermine the \"neutral meeting space\". You deserve your autonomy and it sounds like your utility to them is more important than your development as a person.\n\nFuck em\n\nYou don't get to pick your family which means you aren't obligated to stick around\n\nif theyre going to mistreat you, find someone who won't", "I live with my grandparents right now and it has been a breath of fresh air. I feel like I finally have a home again, a real one, not a bunch of expectations and disappointments aimed at me.\n\nThe point of therapy largely was they wanted their picture perfect family. I was not giving them what they were trying to put together. I wasn't being selfless and devoted enough to the kids.", "You can find comments in this sub that you should never go to therapy with your abuser, because they can either manipulate the therapist to take their side or use what you said in therapy against you. It seems that this happened to you. Your mother and her husband were and are still emotionally abusive towards you. I am very sorry that you had to experience this. You are NTA at all. Please tell your grandparents how you feel, that staying with them is a breath of fresh air, and you found your real home with them. Stay away from your mother's family and have a great life.", "Im glad you've been able to find somewhere your needs are being met. I hope your grandparents are able to provide that pillar of support that your mother and Nick neglected to give you.\n\nThat's not the point of therapy, and it's a shame the therapist didnt spend more time working directly with them to refine their expectations more. It was possibly a little premature to address the family dynamic before ensuring that everyone's expectations of the goals of therapy were consistent and benevolent. Parents who think its ok to use therapy as a tool to get their kids to comply are really missing the point and wasting the time of the therapist and their own resources.\n\nThat being said, maybe some individual therapy going forward might benefit you? It sounds like your needs have been neglected for a long time. I wouldn't be surprised if you have been left with a confusing relationship with your own needs considering they have been minimized your whole life. Only you would know of course, but It'd be unusual if you escaped with anything less than a few scars.\n\nMaybe you should send them the bill since they wasted the last one/s"]}
