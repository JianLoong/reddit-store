You shouldn\u2019t have to change your house but you also shouldn\u2019t invite people to thanksgiving if you don\u2019t plan to feed them a meal. Offering only sides is rude and some of those sides are typically not vegan (for example: mashed potatoes usually have milk, butter or cream). If you don\u2019t want to host them, don\u2019t invite them.", "Info\nAre there actually going to be vegan sides?  Or is it mashed potatoes made with butter and milk (not vegan), stuffing is usually made with a chicken or turkey broth (not vegan), and lots of other traditional Thanksgiving sides (green bean casserole, Mac and cheese, gravy, sweet potato casserole, etc) are not vegan.  Most rolls or breads are not vegan either\n\n\nNow I am not vegan, but I have had to get comfortable knowing what ingredients are in things so to a healthy issue.  And I am hoping you are not confusing vegetarian and vegan because most traditional Thanksgiving dinners have very little for a vegan", "ESH. Most importantly, you suck because you keep saying \"my home\" but if you're married, it's also your wife's home. Your wife is asking for some temporary decorative changes in the home you both share to keep the peace with her family. I agree that this should not be necessary, but she obviously knows her family and doesn't want the drama and emotional labor of running interference between them and the rest of you during her holiday. You've completely disregarded her wishes. You keep complaining about how ridiculous these folks are because they do things differently than you, but you seem equally antagonistic toward them, and I wonder how much of their \"militant\" behavior may actually be them defending themselves from you belittling them. There's nothing inherently wrong with a tofurkey. It's just not your preference. You can have both. For the record, most foods at a traditional thanksgiving dinner are not vegan friendly, including sides like stuffing and mashed potatoes. There may really end up being nothing they can eat there, and that's not being a good host. For what it's worth, this mixing of families for a holiday that's all about food seems like a recipe for disaster, and that's on you and your wife for inviting them all. You say you \"don't mind people with different lifestyles as long as they don't bother\" you, but you've invited people whose dietary choices clearly bother you for a meal.

That\u2019s ridiculous, if they\u2019re *that* bothered by your lifestyle they don\u2019t need to come. Asking to remove the crucifix in particular is honestly offensive, I hope that\u2019s just your wife being overly anxious and not something her family has actually suggested would make them feel more comfortable. \n\nBUT. Asking people you invited to bring their own food to thanksgiving is tacky. Make sure they\u2019ve got a main, too - not just sides. It\u2019s just being a good host. And make sure your sides are either actually all vegan or set aside a batch of vegan sides for them - and let them know that you\u2019ve made the effort. Just mentioning this because people often forget that potatoes stop being vegan if you roast them in duck fat (yum!) or add cream to your mash. \n\nDoesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have your turducken though - if they can\u2019t be in the same room as meat that\u2019s a \u2018them\u2019-problem. \n\nI understand why you don\u2019t want to put in the effort when they don\u2019t treat you well, but this is your opportunity to make sure you do do everything right - *without* compromising on who you are. \n\nBest case scenario they appreciate you more after, worst case scenario they will still be raging, but they\u2019ll look like insufferable idiots to anyone they complain to.

I'm from Montana, I met my wife while I was stationed in Camp Pendleton (Southern California) and my wife decided to move back to Montana with me, I own a bison ranch. I've always been an avid hunter and fisherman, my house is a very old style almost like hunting cabin, I have taxidermized heads of several deer, antelope, and a bull moose, it was actually the 12th biggest moose shot in Montana. \n\nMy wife grew up in a very liberal artsy hippy home in San Francisco, her family are militant vegans and atheists and are just so unbearable to be around.  I don't mind people with different lifestyles as long as they don't bother me. They're the type of people who basically always talks about being vegan and atheists. Her brother actually took bibles and Qurans and put them in the fiction section at a library and posted pics of it on facebook. They mock me for being a Christian, conservative and \"redneck\". They say I'm not cultured and I'm ignorant and all this other crap. We don't really get along, I usually just try to keep the peace but they always like to pick fights with me and when I don't bite they continue to push it. They say I \"brainwashed\" her daughter because she votes the same way as I do, loves fishing hunting and goes to church with me and prefers Montana over California. \n\nSo here's the conflict. My wife wants me to basically remove all the taxidermies, the crucifixes, the rifle I hang up on the wall, basically anything else thats related to hunting, fishing, religion or whatever they hate to appease her family.  I told her no, that they're in my home and they don't have a right to change it. She said she understands this is frustrating but she would like to maintain a good relationship with her family and that this could avoid some conflicts. The final straw was when she asked me to make a \"tofurkey\" or whatever this dumbass tofu turkey is called. I always make Turduckens, this time i plan on doing a four bird roast, my sister, her family and my parents are coming over as well and none of them watn this vegan crap. I told my wife her family can bring their own vegan food, there'll be vegan sides, vegetables, mashed potatoes, stuffing, other stuff but thats not enough. \n\nWe keep having arguments about this. I think I'm on the right because it is my house and more of my family than her family will be there. My family loves my wife but her family treats me like shit so its frustrating.
