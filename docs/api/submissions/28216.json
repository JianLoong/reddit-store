If you want a partner with slightly more conservative values, it's completely fine; there are plenty of fish in the sea.

I suggest trying the latter, and see if life simply goes on.

Every couple has differences in how the communicate and express themselves, and they aren't always guaranteed to be comfortable with each others' behaviour.
