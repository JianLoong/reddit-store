This isn't about you at all. If she gets creeps sliding into her DMs (don't worry, I'm sure she already does!), she can take care of that herself. She's a content creator, you don't think she knows how to deal with this stuff? \n\nStop infantilizing your gf (what's with all the weird \"English is not her first language,\" it's not rocket science to figure out this elementary English language pun?) and maybe rethink if you're as supportive of her hobby as you think you are.", "It does sound controlling. She's not actually offering pornographic content, so I don't see your issue. Don't worry, the worst creeps from the deepest sewers message any woman in the internet. It's not her responsibility to stay offline for your comfort. YTA.", "It's pretty basic word play. She's a woman doing cosplay on the internet so I guarantee you she's already dealing with creeps. YTA", "YTA. It's a joke and it's funny. Anyone clicking on the link will see it's X and if they understand the humor they will chuckle. It's really not a big deal, why are you so disturbed by it? Are you a jealous and controlling type of person?", "YTA. If *she* wants to say something rude on *her* site, and assuming she is a 22 year old with all her faculties, who are you to police her language? I'm assuming you don't live in a conservative muslim country?\n\nIt is a clever play on words. And it doesn't lead to porn of her. It is mildly titillating in the same way old Carry On movies were 50 years ago. Somehow you are further behind the times than even that.\n\nYou do sound very much like a crazy control freak. English is my first and only language, I went to a grammar school in England in fact, so believe me when I say that the words you use here make you sound worryingly controlling. Currently those strangers sound pretty good by comparison.", "YTA. \n\nThere is nothing at all \u201cexplicitly pornographic\u201d about \u201cWanna C my X\u201d.

That's honestly the worst you can say about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sure she knows what \"X\" means in this context and is having a bit of (very slightly) dirty fun.

I totally understand your concern, but you should have explained yourself instead of ordering her to change something she was proud of.\n\nAlso, you sound condescending when saying English is not their first, second or third language, as if that was the only excuse they had for thinking you're a jerk (English is not my first language either, so take my comment however you want)", "YTA and I promise you that she's already had creepy people in her DMs. She already knows how to deal with them. Stop being insecure.", "YTA.\n\nEven if it is explicit, that is a proven method of advertising. It helps her generate revenue. You are handicapping her earning potential.", "YTA. It's a *slightly* dirty joke. She probably already gets plenty of pervs and I doubt a link on her linktree will significantly affect the volume. If I'm wrong and it does, she'll probably change it of her own accord.", "YTA it's a play on words you know she's not doing anything pornographic so who cares how it sounds.", "Yta dude that was a clever pun", "No backup from me.

I understand how you feel, and you just want to protect her, but she won't feel like that's what you're doing. Especially if her friends are jumping in on it as well. It might feel like she could be in danger from creeps, but trust me. There's hundreds of thousands of girls doing this. The creeps just jump from one to another.

What she is doing is what is needed to be done to market yourself on the internet.  You need something that stands out to get the interest going.  Without it, it's just an idle page.  You already know that she isn't doing anything adult related so why all the insecurity.  The \"X\" thing is actually a really good idea. \n\nLastly, the worst of the internet has already found her.
