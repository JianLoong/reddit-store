I met my current wife (40F) about 6 months after the divorce finalized and we\u2019ve been married for 6 years. My wife has 3 kids from her previous marriage (17M, 13M and 10F) and we have 6 month old infants (boy/girl) together. \n\nMy oldest currently lives with us, she took a gap year after she graduated, went to college this year before dropping out, we are currently helping her figure out what she wants to do next but for now she\u2019s been helping our nanny with the infants. \n\nMy middle stepson is currently dating a girl from his school, my stepson and his friends will often stay at our house to play with our sporting equipment, and my stepson\u2019s girlfriend is also an athlete, so she\u2019ll play as well. The boys and her also play video games together and do other normal teen stuff. \n\nMy stepson\u2019s girlfriend also has ADHD, my stepson and his friends are high energy teens, but his girlfriend is the most energetic person I\u2019ve met, she\u2019s a sweet kid and is fidgety, talks a lot and can be forgetful. My wife and I don\u2019t mind this, my brother\u2019s son (14M) also has ADHD and he\u2019s such a good boy and my stepson\u2019s gf reminds me of him. \n\nHis girlfriend will sometimes use fidget toys to regulate, will go on about a topic for a while, ect. My oldest has picked up on this and has been making rude remarks to her and my stepson. \n\nShe\u2019s called her a blabbermouth, has asked mean questions like if she has dementia and has got into fights like when she was being \u201ctoo aggressive\u201d while playing basketball with the boys. My stepson and the boys have always defended her and my wife and I have tried talking to her, telling her to keep her remarks to herself. \n\nA few days ago, two of the boys came up to me and said that my daughter was ruining the vibes and they didn\u2019t want to hang out if the remarks didn\u2019t stop. I went to talk to my daughter once again and she dismissed it as the boys being sensitive and a difference between \u201colder and younger Gen Z\u201d. At that point, I told her that she needed to leave and to go to her mom\u2019s house. She said I was being ridiculous but I made her go. \n\nMy ex called me and said that I was being unfair to her and that this could cause trouble with her step kids (10F, 8F and 7F) and that I should just take her back and I\u2019m only sympathetic bc of my brother\u2019s son. My wife also expressed concern, saying while she loves her son/our stepson she doesn\u2019t want to cause a rift and thought I was being a bit harsh. \n\nMy stepson though is happy and has asked us not to invite her back, and has even started talking about how I\u2019m such a great stepdad, we\u2019ve always bonded but he\u2019s being nicer than usual (he\u2019s a nice kid normally though). \n\nMy parents are also upset at me.
