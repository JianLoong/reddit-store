My wife has 3 kids from her previous marriage (17M, 13M and 10F) and we have 6 month old infants (boy/girl) together. \n\nMy oldest currently lives with us, she took a gap year after she graduated, went to college this year before dropping out, we are currently helping her figure out what she wants to do next but for now she\u2019s been helping our nanny with the infants. \n\nMy middle stepson is currently dating a girl from his school, my stepson and his friends will often stay at our house to play with our sporting equipment, and my stepson\u2019s girlfriend is also an athlete, so she\u2019ll play as well. The boys and her also play video games together and do other normal teen stuff. \n\nMy stepson\u2019s girlfriend also has ADHD, my stepson and his friends are high energy teens, but his girlfriend is the most energetic person I\u2019ve met, she\u2019s a sweet kid and is fidgety, talks a lot and can be forgetful.

I went to talk to my daughter once again and she dismissed it as the boys being sensitive and a difference between \u201colder and younger Gen Z\u201d. At that point, I told her that she needed to leave and to go to her mom\u2019s house. She said I was being ridiculous but I made her go. \n\nMy ex called me and said that I was being unfair to her and that this could cause trouble with her step kids (10F, 8F and 7F) and that I should just take her back and I\u2019m only sympathetic bc of my brother\u2019s son. My wife also expressed concern, saying while she loves her son/our stepson she doesn\u2019t want to cause a rift and thought I was being a bit harsh. \n\nMy stepson though is happy and has asked us not to invite her back, and has even started talking about how I\u2019m such a great stepdad, we\u2019ve always bonded but he\u2019s being nicer than usual (he\u2019s a nice kid normally though). \n\nMy parents are also upset at me.

Please don\u2019t try to take that from me by refusing to accept my disability.", ">| a fellow squirrel\n\nI laughed so hard at that, thank you!", "You can use whatever you like when it comes to yourself. But know it absolutely comes across as condescending af to the majority of *disabled* people you may meet. Personally I think \"differently abled\" is almost as bad as a slur, and often used as one - so again, YMMV, but don't be surprised that your very off-putting language puts people off.", "Can I ask out of genuine curiosity why you consider it almost as bad as a slur? I think it's dumb and I agree it's rather condescending, but I really would like to know if you've had a bad experience with that term or if a lot of people have, because I've never heard of it being used in the way that slurs for disabled people are typically used.", "I am not the person in question, but I have done disability research (and am disabled myself) so I can give you a common perspective.  For many people, the notion of disability is social.  So for instance let\u2019s suppose you have a mobility impairment and use a wheelchair. If there are only stairs to access a building, that is disabling, because you are not able to access the building.  If there is a ramp, you are able to access the building and the builder\u2019s choice doesn\u2019t prevent you from accessing the building.  \n\nThe term \u201cdisability\u201d thus has a social component for many because (the idea goes) in a perfect world we would have accommodations for all impairments so no one would be prevented from accessing any part of society - they would not be disabled.  \n\nThe objection to \u201cdifferently abled\u201d is that it basically skips over this.  So if I\u2019m in a wheelchair and there are only stairs\u2026I\u2019m not differently abled.  If I had wings or something, then I would be differently abled because I could still access the building, just in a different way.  But in the wheelchair I can\u2019t access it at all.  Thus I am disabled by this design choice. \n\nThere are plenty of criticisms of this - for instance my husband has adhd and sees it as disabling because of how it affects him, regardless of any accommodation society could offer.  But I think there is also some truth to the idea that impairments don\u2019t have to be disabling in a lot of cases if we as a society are willing to plan for them and treat those people as valuable members of society whose participation is desired, rather than as an inconvenience we try to ignore as much as possible.  \n\nSorry for the novel here, but you seemed genuinely curious and I like to answer when people ask questions about things like this in good faith.", "I would not let her back.
