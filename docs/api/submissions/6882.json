Nobody needs to watch that 4 year old other than the parents. And if the parents can't then put them in daycare. Simple. If you can't afford daycare then why did you even have the kid in the first place when you're in a bad financial spot? And it seems like they do have the money but would rather have family bail them out instead of acting responsibly."]}
