A few years back, my wife's parents decided that they wanted to change cities - be closer to us and the kids, make a life change, etc.\n\nSo they sold their house and moved in with us whilst they found a new place. The plan was for this to take 3 months or so. Almost immediately it became clear that the in-laws had differing opinions on what they wanted out of a house; FIL wants a bigger place - big acerage, MIL wants a small place - more manageable. They're both in their late 60s.\n\nIt also became clear that they didn't do any market research and that the place they sold won't give them enough funds to buy a place in our city. So they need to manage their future plans somewhat.\n\nAfter about 7 mths, they land on a place that requires a moderate amount of work. They spend a few months looking for a builder, find one - but haven't really thought about the work they want to do and let the contractor take the lead. Eventually he gets bored with the job and they're back looking for builders again.\n\nMeanwhile, my wife and are having some conflict about this. From her perspective, she'd do anything for her parents and wants to help them out. From my perspective, my first duty is to my family (wife and kids) and am willing to help out the in-laws - to a point.\n\nMy main concern is that the in-laws don't have much of a plan; their vibe is \"don't worry, it'll all work out\". Which is fine, but I'm spending my weekends helping them clean up their renovation - instead of spending time with my kids. Further more they don't contribute to household expenses; they buy their own food - but we pay for all the utilities.\n\nMy wife and I have disagreements about how to handle the living arrangements. I would like to have a sit down (all the adults) and discuss the situation - note to them that they've been here for 2 years and that I'd like to understand how they can contribute to household expenses whilst they progress their plans to move out.\n\nMy wife doesn't want to discuss it at all and often cites that \"they'll be moving out soon, so just leave it for now\". I've heard this for the past 18mths and we're now at the 2 year mark.\n\nIt's gotten to the point that I just don't want them here and have become distant about the whole thing. I don't talk to my wife about it (as it just seems to aggravate our marriage) and I barely talk to the in-laws anymore, as I feel they're responsible for much of this.\n\nSo overall - AITA for wanting my in-laws to move out or start contributing to householde expenses (or both)?", "created_utc": 1689765733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153s8lb/aita_not_wanting_my_inlaws_living_with_us/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have leaned over backwards with these people. enough is enough.

Good luck.", "NTA - your wife is too emotionally invested in this because they are her parents. She is unable to be rational and businesslike here. And it seems that she and her parents all have a \u201cgo with the flow\u201d attitude- which can be a blessing and a curse. You need to sit her down and help her understand the effect it\u2019s having on you. You are clearly becoming pretty resentful and for good reason. You\u2019re right to want to focus on your own kids while they are young.  All three of them are taking advantage of your kindness and you need to establish some boundaries before you reach your breaking point.", "NTA. Strongly suggest marriage therapy. This situation is not the problem, it\u2019s a symptom. You and your wife need outside guidance on how to problem-solve and communicate honestly. Good luck, it sounds super exhausting.", "NTA, communication is important in all living situations.", "At the two-year mark, you have fulfilled your obligation to your wife and her parents. Give them a firm, fair date to move out and discuss an action plan to get there. NTA, but you need to advocate for yourself.", "NTA (but with a slight ESH). You've been way more patient than I would have been.\n\nThis whole thing has been badly handled from the start. The inlaws actually sold their old place and moved in with you guys without even having had a conversation between themselves about what kind of place they want to buy! And without doing even the most basic research on what they can afford in your area. \n\nThen you and your wife let them move in without having a discussion and agreement between yourselves about how long the inlaws would live with you or having them help cover expenses if they're there beyond a certain time frame.\n\nAnd then all four of you had them move in without having any discussion between the two couples about how long they could stay or what their plans were or what expenses they should cover.\n\nThen the inlaws don't seem to feel any sense of urgency at all regarding getting out of your place and into their own.\n\nAnd now, to top it off, when you're finally losing patience with this neverending process, your wife refuses to have any discussion about it with you or with them.\n\nTo sum up, the inlaws never talked to each other about this. You & your wife never talked to each other about this. You & your wife never had a discussion with your inlaws about this. And the non-talking is going to continue forever and ever.

If they aren't babies you could bring them with to help with the renovations.

I just think it's what the ILs need, a bit of project management and positive reinforcement.\n\nNeedless to say we'd never put them out on their asses - but the constant \"next month we're moving out\" is getting to both of us.

The problem is, you're making it easier for them to stay.  They absolutely sb contributing more. Maybe once they start contributing financially, this will light a fire on them to get out.

They may be dragging their feet to runout the clock until they can say they're no longer able to live independently and stay forever.

Look at the timeline. \n\n2 years ago was when the market surged. The in-laws didn't plan at all. They just saw housing prices going up and jumped on board, without realizing that the market would continue to increase the costs, which means they are either stupid or this was the plan all along.\n\nThe market is cooling a bit, but isn't hitting the major dropoff of previous booms (because of the corporate ownership of 20% of the new properties that went on the market - those fuckers can hold onto inventory forever because of lax and terrible regulations, but I digress), but also everyone knew that was going to be the case and have been predicting it.\n\nSo now OP has paid for 24 months of his in-law's magical thinking, 21 months longer than he agreed to.

Yes they are tenants by now.", "Maybe but she is not one claiming that her first duty is to the husband", "Dude... it's way past time to tell her there's only two choices: they leave or you leave.  She already lied you into two years.  From a starting point of 3 months to 2 years and counting.\n\nIf you don't want to live with them the rest of your life, clarify her choices for her.\n\nYou're saying stuff like \"progress their plans to move out\" -- do people who already overstayed 21 months sound like that's going to work?"]}
