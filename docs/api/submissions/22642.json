A few years back, my wife's parents decided that they wanted to change cities - be closer to us and the kids, make a life change, etc.\n\nSo they sold their house and moved in with us whilst they found a new place. The plan was for this to take 3 months or so. Almost immediately it became clear that the in-laws had differing opinions on what they wanted out of a house; FIL wants a bigger place - big acerage, MIL wants a small place - more manageable. They're both in their late 60s.\n\nIt also became clear that they didn't do any market research and that the place they sold won't give them enough funds to buy a place in our city. So they need to manage their future plans somewhat.\n\nAfter about 7 mths, they land on a place that requires a moderate amount of work. They spend a few months looking for a builder, find one - but haven't really thought about the work they want to do and let the contractor take the lead. Eventually he gets bored with the job and they're back looking for builders again.\n\nMeanwhile, my wife and are having some conflict about this. From her perspective, she'd do anything for her parents and wants to help them out. From my perspective, my first duty is to my family (wife and kids) and am willing to help out the in-laws - to a point.\n\nMy main concern is that the in-laws don't have much of a plan; their vibe is \"don't worry, it'll all work out\". Which is fine, but I'm spending my weekends helping them clean up their renovation - instead of spending time with my kids. Further more they don't contribute to household expenses; they buy their own food - but we pay for all the utilities.\n\nMy wife and I have disagreements about how to handle the living arrangements. I would like to have a sit down (all the adults) and discuss the situation - note to them that they've been here for 2 years and that I'd like to understand how they can contribute to household expenses whilst they progress their plans to move out.\n\nMy wife doesn't want to discuss it at all and often cites that \"they'll be moving out soon, so just leave it for now\". I've heard this for the past 18mths and we're now at the 2 year mark.\n\nIt's gotten to the point that I just don't want them here and have become distant about the whole thing. I don't talk to my wife about it (as it just seems to aggravate our marriage) and I barely talk to the in-laws anymore, as I feel they're responsible for much of this.\n\nSo overall - AITA for wanting my in-laws to move out or start contributing to householde expenses (or both)?\n\nUPDATE: Thanks to everyone who has responded, it's been great to get some perspective, both for and against (at least ones thst are outside my own head and household).\n\nBy way of explaining to all - we did discuss them moving in before it happened, but the plan quickly fell apart when it came to light that they had no clue. We didn't want to be heartless about it and kick them out; but equally - we didn't handle it the best either. I've left most of those comms to my wife and I recognise (in hindsight) that I should have taken a more active part.

One is aloof and thinks the world revolves around him, the other is more outward focussed and mindful of others.\n\nBoth are about a full day's drive away or a 5hr plane flight.", "They were giving $50 p/w for the first month or two, but my wife felt weird about this and we agreed to not accept it anymore - citing that they'd be saving that money for their house.\n\nAbout 12mths ago I was going back through the bills and looking at the increase in expenses, the cost of wear & year on our appliances from having 6ppl in the house, etc. and wanted to raise it again. But, there was this constant juggle of \"what's the point bringing it up? They'll be moving out soon anyway?\" so we just delayed it for a quarter, then the next set of bills come in and the next one and the next one.\n\nFinancially we don't need their contribution, we're quite fortunate in that - but I'm looking to it as a soft motivator to signal that \"the free ride is over - if you want to stay here  it now comes with strings (that will get tighter as time goes on)\".\n\nI have to remind myself not to get too negative about all of this. Sometimes I feel like they're teenagers, lounging around, not paying rent, etc. Other times I think \"were helping them out, every $ they save is more towards their long-term goal\".\n\nI think it's just the open-ended nature of it all that is getting to me.", "We did have a strategy before  they moved in, but it quickly fell apart when it became clear that the ILs were struggling to find a place.\n\nWe didn't want to put undue pressure on them, but there were a bunch of factors at play (like their parents passing away) and we thought we'll give them some space and let it slide for another 3mths.\n\nMy wife and I do have an existing strategy as well, but it's basically us moving away for work - I fortunately have a job where relocation is a possibility. We'd then need to either sell the house or rent it out and this would be the trigger for them to leave.\n\nBuuuut, I don't think we need to use that extreme as it's quite disruptive to kids schooling and other aspects.\n\nI should have noted in the original post that my wife and I were the first ones to move away from the city that we all grew up in. We'd become sick of being the family mediators (me on my side of the family and her on the other), so we moved about 20hrs drive away, started new jobs, new lives, etc. Since then other family members have done the same; siblings moved interstate, some overseas - but the ILs moved closer to us.\n\nFull disclosure: we encouraged the move as we all do get along (when we're not living on top of each other).\n\nWe now have kids and a house, so a big shake-up like that carries extra burden - but is still an option to play.", "I think both would end up at the same outcome.\n\nMy tone is more \"It's been a while now, let's talk about the future - so thst we can all move on.\"", "You make good points.\n\nMy approach to these kinds of things is to have it out in the open and to take about it objectively and transparently.\n\nMy wife feels that this is to confronting and would damage the relationship, which is already strained. She has asked me to not have this conversation with them, citing that. So I don't feel I'm hiding behind her, I'm honouring her wishes.\n\n The ILs can sense that their presence is unwelcome and are (now) trying to accelerate their renovations; but they've not reached out (to me at least) to broach the subject. It may be thst my wife is also asking them to not raise the topic....\n\nFwiw, I can see the strain it's creating. I'm living it.\n\nI can see the issues that are being exacerbated by not dealing with it. My kids are of a young age (6 & 4) and have no concerns with having their grandparents at our place - but I suspect that the adult tension is subtle and subconsciously creating anxiety for them.", "Yeah that's my approach.\n\nI suspect there are some underlying issues, like they can't progress parts of the rennovation until they save more money or something.\n\nEither way I just want it to be an open, honest discussion with realistic expectations from both sides.", "No you're right to draw a hard line at exposing your kids to asbestos", "Yeah seems crazy to put it in writing and say out loud, but when I brought it up there was varying levels of giving a fuck.\n\nI honestly feel like going crazy with it all. Sometimes it's hard to get out of my head and keep measured with it.\n\nI almost flipped out about the way that the bins were put back the other day; I mean....wtf  who cares if a wheelie bin lid opens onto the fence (the way the put it back) or away from the fence (the way I put it back).\n\nBut for some reason this made a primal rage fill up inside of me and I thought \"that's fkn great! So when the bin is full of stuff, how am I supposed to get to the handle (fence side) so that I can move it to the curb\".\n\nLittle things are causing me to have blood pressure spikes. But......also a good opportunity to practice mindfulness.", "Nta, kick.them.out, or you'll never get rid of them", "I\u2019d have my parents staying weeks at a time!", "Yeah that's my approach.\n\nI suspect there are some underlying issues, like they can't progress parts of the rennovation until they save more money or something.\n\nEither way I just want it to be an open, honest discussion with realistic expectations from both sides.", "Yikes. It would be different if they were fragile and elderly and if your wife were an only child. \n\n***Are your inlaws staying in the master bedroom, by chance? Does wife have issues with being right or with always getting her way? It may be less about them and more about her showing you. \n\nYou\u2019re right: The inlaws are being the AHs. What God puts together, let no man put asunder, but these people are driving a huge wedge in your marriage, with your wife\u2019s help. Seems maybe your motherinlaw runs your wife\u2019s dad, so your wife is running you. \n\nHer parents have chosen a house\u2026yours. :( \n\nWonder what wife would say if your parent(s) asked to move in\u2026\n\nParents could use their time and money to build a guesthouse in back that would add value to your home and at least get them out from under your roof. Maybe y\u2019all could pay half of it. \n\nHow do you not do crazy things in your house to annoy those people?!?!?!", "Then have it. You want the conversation, then have the conversation. Your wife may not like it, but she\u2019ll sure as Sunday respect it! You just want to quit walking around on tiptoes.", "Mil will come with him because what is she gonna do by herself in the countryside 5 days and nights a week. Not to mention all the strange noises at night. She won't know anyone locally. Don't offer to let Fil stay even if he's paying rent. Send him studio apartment rentals to look at. He decided to buy a house 1h from work so he has to do the commute.\n\nHonestly, i think you and wife would benefit from a few sessions of couples therapy. A mediator to help you discuss the position you are in now and how to best get out of it. Might help your wife realise that the current situation is not healthy or sustainable. If you can get her to go then do it before talking to her parents.\n\nIf you can get them to move out, suggest a caravan on site to live in till work is complete. Or fix up 1 room and live in that. Better and easier for them to manage the work on site and reach the end point.", "I should note that they're living in a granny flat in the backyard. They have their own 4 walls, roof, toilet, and shower.  There are no cooking facilities, so they've used part of the shed (big double bay thing) and have set up a cooking station on a workbench.\n\nSo...it's not like they're waking the kids up when they go to the toilet during the night or cluttering up the kitchen when making school lunches, etc. But there is still some impact - like wanting to use the washing machine/clothes line whilst we are, asking us to move our cars so that they can used the driveway, etc.\n\nMy wife has said that if the roles were reversed (my parents instead of hers) that I'd not see anything wrong with it (WRONG!) or thst if the parents needed to live with us for medical reasons that that this is no different (which again I dispute).\n\nShe does have issues with not being in control of things; usually we share the 'lead' on things and I've let her run this matter to date. I've been vocal about changing this for the past 8/9mths as I feel she's too emotionally invested to approach it clearly.\n\nShe, in response, feels that I'll be too bull-headed and steam roll them with a \"my way or the highway\" approach. So there's a trust issue there. To be fair to her, I usually approach matters in a very direct and assertive manner. I leave little room for interpretation, ambiguity or confusion - I don't see anything wrong with being upfront about feelings and expectations. Similarly I'm not so pig-headed to disregard their counter-points. I'm approaching this like a family negotiation; both parties need things - so let's find a way to achieve a win-win scenario.\n\nRegarding the last point; I mostly just grind my teeth. Part of me wants to do evil things - like switch off the water going to the granny flat, deactivate the WiFi in there, etc. But I also have to remember that:\n* they're an older generation that are self-involved and somewhat ignorant of those around them,\n* are way out-of-their depth with this rennovation and need help (even if they're too proud to ask for it),\n* I'm not the type to kick a person when they're down,\n* I want to set a good example to my kids; when people need help - you help them, to help themselves (last part very important).\n* they're not being hostile to us or subversive in any way; if we asked them to outline a plan for exit or asked them to contribute financially - I believe they would.\n** the issue here is that my wife and I are stuck in a cycle of not broaching this conversation.\n* at the end of the day they're family, I want to have a good relationship with them and this is just a rough patch.\n* in consideration of world event, no-one has died. This is just a minor miscommunication that has dragged out unadressed.", "She has asked me to not, so would see it as a direct conflict to her wishes.\n\nAt present I'm trying to create a conversation around the edges where the ILs ask me outright, then I can say that they asked about it and I answered.\n\nNot my preference.", "Yeah, that's where I'm coming from too. It boggles the mind as their whole idea of moving to the country was to pursue plans running a B&B, hobby farm or other stuff. At least that was the initial plan - they may have had new thoughts, but I'm not keen on them staying with us for ANY days of the week.\n\nThis is another reason to have the family meeting, not just the immediate \"when are you moving out\" discussion, but also manage some expectation about the future.\n\nCouples therapy - 100%. This situation is the largest area of conflict, but we do have this kind of thing in other areas. General approaches to parenting, views on future priorities, etc. At some point I think this is normal; such is the nature of a team (different perspectives to a joint approach), but sometimes there are significant variances- like our approach to this \n\nThe irony is that they have a camper trailer (a canvas one), so have this option available. They have 1 bedroom livable at their house, but it's the other stuff (working toilet, reliable water source, etc) that is key to them moving out. The (new) self-imposed deadline is by end of September, as this is when the bare essentials will be finished. They will likely be living on a construction site for another 6mths.", "Phew! This really is a better case scenario than originally thought. Hope you get your answers soon. Prayers!", "eh I mean we're approaching an age of collectively not giving a fuck what people we care about are exposed to. It's largely a response to the covid response being \"shut up, mask off, die for the economy\"\n\nlike I know people who are actively bullied by family for caring whether their kids are exposed to something known to cause liver failure and brain damage in young kids, it makes sense that in this environment the response to asbestos exposure would be \"fuck it we all die\"", "After reading you other comments, it seems your wide may have convinced her parents to move to your town so they can help babysit, and now wife feels guilty for how tough it has been for them to find a house. So, she\u2019s trying to make it easier on them so they can have something really nice since this whole thing was for them to help raise your kids. \n\nIt is odd how your wife can go against your wishes, but you won\u2019t go against her wishes. She\u2019s probably told her parents that you\u2019re totally fine with them staying as long as they need to. The contractor gave them estimated time for different projects\u2026and your wife and inlaws know the time\u2026but they don\u2019t want to tell you and you\u2019re supposed to keep your mouth shut and keep working like a dog.  She\u2019s telling everyone not to say anything, but meanwhile, she knows. \n\nNot trying to be mean toward your spouse; she probably thinks she\u2019s helping to keep you from getting upset\u2014that\u2019s the only funny part about this whole thing. \n\nThat fourth fireplace before they move in would do me in. Would\u2019ve been cheaper for y\u2019all to hire babysitters and let the parents stay in their own teepee. \n\nBeat of luck to you.", "Yes! I\u2019d be ready for everybody to get out of the pool at this point.", "Yeah, I respect other opinions to not give a fuck - but equally expect them to respect our opinions about not wanting to get our (then 3yo) exposed to COVID (they were too young to be immunised).\n\nThey did, but it was the usual dance of understanding each other's starting point and then exerting our dominance around \"it's our house, and we're talking about the health of our kids. If you can't accept that, you can leave.\"\n\nThey got the message, but sometimes I wonder what goes through people heads...."]}
