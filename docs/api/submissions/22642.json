A few years back, my wife's parents decided that they wanted to change cities - be closer to us and the kids, make a life change, etc.\n\nSo they sold their house and moved in with us whilst they found a new place. The plan was for this to take 3 months or so. Almost immediately it became clear that the in-laws had differing opinions on what they wanted out of a house; FIL wants a bigger place - big acerage, MIL wants a small place - more manageable. They're both in their late 60s.\n\nIt also became clear that they didn't do any market research and that the place they sold won't give them enough funds to buy a place in our city. So they need to manage their future plans somewhat.\n\nAfter about 7 mths, they land on a place that requires a moderate amount of work. They spend a few months looking for a builder, find one - but haven't really thought about the work they want to do and let the contractor take the lead. Eventually he gets bored with the job and they're back looking for builders again.\n\nMeanwhile, my wife and are having some conflict about this. From her perspective, she'd do anything for her parents and wants to help them out. From my perspective, my first duty is to my family (wife and kids) and am willing to help out the in-laws - to a point.\n\nMy main concern is that the in-laws don't have much of a plan; their vibe is \"don't worry, it'll all work out\". Which is fine, but I'm spending my weekends helping them clean up their renovation - instead of spending time with my kids. Further more they don't contribute to household expenses; they buy their own food - but we pay for all the utilities.\n\nMy wife and I have disagreements about how to handle the living arrangements. I would like to have a sit down (all the adults) and discuss the situation - note to them that they've been here for 2 years and that I'd like to understand how they can contribute to household expenses whilst they progress their plans to move out.\n\nMy wife doesn't want to discuss it at all and often cites that \"they'll be moving out soon, so just leave it for now\". I've heard this for the past 18mths and we're now at the 2 year mark.\n\nIt's gotten to the point that I just don't want them here and have become distant about the whole thing. I don't talk to my wife about it (as it just seems to aggravate our marriage) and I barely talk to the in-laws anymore, as I feel they're responsible for much of this.\n\nSo overall - AITA for wanting my in-laws to move out or start contributing to householde expenses (or both)?\n\nUPDATE: Thanks to everyone who has responded, it's been great to get some perspective, both for and against (at least ones thst are outside my own head and household).\n\nBy way of explaining to all - we did discuss them moving in before it happened, but the plan quickly fell apart when it came to light that they had no clue. We didn't want to be heartless about it and kick them out; but equally - we didn't handle it the best either. I've left most of those comms to my wife and I recognise (in hindsight) that I should have taken a more active part.
