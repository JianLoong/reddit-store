They have three school-age children - including one who is on the autism spectrum and attends a special needs school. All three children are enrolled in private schools - but also happen to live in areas with at least decent public options. (Although I\u2019m unclear about options for my autistic niece.)\n\nMy brother and sister-in-law own a small number of hotels and were doing quite well financially until COVID hit, with no real recovery in sight as small business owners. They\u2019re currently looking to sell the business. It is also worth noting that they are property-rich with multiple houses and cash-poor. In mid-2020, they reached out and asked if I could pay the private school fees for their kids. I have been very happy to do this - over the past three years, this has amounted to gifting them $100,000 to-date.\n\nMy brother claims it\u2019s a loan, but in my head it\u2019s truly a gift. If he never pays me back, I would be perfectly OK with it. I feel like if you lend money to family, you have to be prepared and OK with the idea of not getting paid back, so I already mentally prepared when I agreed to this. It\u2019s generally never been a big deal about this - mostly because I\u2019ve been genuinely happy to do it. This is not the problem.\n\nThe problem is that they keep asking for money - my brother recently called me up asking for me to pay for the next school year for them, as well. I can afford it but it is reaching a pretty material amount to me - I'm not made of money either. I also worry about the moral hazard that this creates - where they assume I will subsidize their lifestyle indefinitely. I think they are relying on me to defer making some harder choices in their lives and personal finances \u2013 for example, selling one of their extra houses or maybe considering public school choices, if they truly cannot afford private school. (I also admit being a little annoyed that they went on a 3-week family holiday in Florida last year while still asking me to fund school.) On the other hand, this really speaks to the life outcomes of my niece and nephews - I love them dearly and want the best for them.\n\nWhile I might choose to continue the arrangement (and i realize that would be just my choice), what are my moral obligations here?  WIBTA if I gave them a clear timeline - e.g., one more school year to be funded by me - so that they have enough time to plan ahead and make some thoughtful decisions about their personal finances and priorities? t also feels like just yanking the rug out from under them would be the wrong decision. Or would I be screwing up my niece and nephews' lives by playing the moral high ground with my brother and sister-in-law?  \n\n\nHelp!\n\nDoting Uncle", "created_utc": 1684350635, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13kb1uv/wibta_if_i_stopped_paying_for_my_niece_and/", "score": 211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I say this not to complain, but to clarify that private school is a choice not a right.

And it can't go on forever.", "Why would they sell it? They've got you carrying them on your back. They turned down the offer and ordered themselves another round of drinks on their 3 week vacation.", ": )", "Also, my brother works as an in-house lawyer at a tech company - so they've got other sources of income, too.", "They are SO taking you for granted and using you.", "Well, they could try to sell the business properties, but that's a tougher proposition than residential real estate right now.", "I'm not trying to be rude but nothing you answered changed my mind. They're using you to pay for the kids education while they screw around. Sorry.", "Yes, totally agree. I think they're trying to get a good deal for the business - but the residential real estate is certainly up for grabs", "No, it's not rude at all. I appreciate the insight and perspective! : )\n\nThank you!", "NTA - you have already given them huge assistance and time to sort out their cashflow issues.  If they can afford a 3 week holiday then they can definitely fund their own kid\u2019s schooling.  Cut the bank off and let them do the responsible thing they should have been doing.", "I swear this has been posted before", "NTA they're scamming you, OP.  Real estate prices are sky high, they could have unloaded one of their \"extra\" houses at any point, paid you back, and set money up for the kids future.  \n\nIf they scrapped together enough cash for THREE WEEKS in Florida, they can do without your generosity.  If you are concerned about the kids, pay the school directly, don't give your brother and SIL another penny.", "30-40 days doesn't seem that bad to me. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f The only time I've sold a house, it was in a horrendous buyer's market, it took five months to sell, and we were lucky to break even.", "You're welcome! \n\nYou know your brother and can better predict how he would react, but this is what I would do not knowing your brother.\n\nI would first not pay for any of their schooling. Then let him get upset, then offer to pay for the autistic child's schooling. This will make it seem like your ultimate offer is better than if you went straight to paying only for the autistic child's school.", "Rich people are different.  It sounds like 100k to them is not 100k to most people.", "It depends on what you\u2019re comparing it to. My husband and I are trying to move to a new city. We saw a house we liked, it hit the listings at 8am. By 11am 17 showings had been scheduled. By 9pm that night it was under contract and sold for $93,000 over list. My best friend in that city listed her house, had 9 showings the first day and an offer for $8,000 over list by dinner time. Two other houses I was interested in hit the market under contract, both for over list. \n\nSo when we\u2019re looking at our current city where prices have dropped 3% over the last year, and places are sitting for a month or more\u2026it doesn\u2019t feel that good as a potential seller.", "NTA - You are not \"screwing up their lives\" by no longer enabling their parents to make adult decisions. In fact I would argue that the longer you sustain supporting them, the more you are adding to their issue.\n\nAs adults 9and especially as parents) we sometimes need to make tough choices. And with all due respect if one of their \"tough choices\" is simply selling one of their multitude of properties to support their own kids... \\*stares at you\\* That's called parenting. Thats being an adult. That's taking RESPONSIBILITY.\n\nVersus, you know... using your sibling as an ATM because you know you can use the niece and nephew to guilt them into compliance. Which is 10000% what they are doing.\n\nThey have you well trained if you are here asking strangers if you are a bad person for telling them to start taking charge of their own lives and their kids education. If we came and posted here asking the same, what would you tell us? I'm pretty sure it would be along the lines of...:  \"Hey man, you are being used and abused by the people you love. It's time to tell them to buck up and take responsibility for their lives. They have the money they just refuse to take action to use it. That is N O T the same as not being able to afford it. Stop letting them use you, it's setting a terribly disrespectful precedence and they don't love you the way you love those kids.\"", "No they can go to public school \u2026", "NTA You were very generous in helping them insulate their children from drastic change when the pandemic affected their finances. They have had time to make and implement new plans to fund the childrens' private school. If they need to sell a property, they should do that. I don't think it would be out of line for you to put a timeline on your help. It is unfair for them to expect you to fund the tuition indefinitely.", "NTA\n\nIf you're okay with not getting paid back for the first $100,000 that is great. I would make the next payment contingent though. \n\n1. I will cover payments but expect to be paid back by X date. If that means you have to sell your property, then you need to do that.", "What this means is that they are simply not wanting to change their lifestyle at all. If they\u2019ve got assets then they\u2019ve got options, but they\u2019re ignoring those options in favour of milking you. It\u2019s great to have investment properties, but not if you can\u2019t pay for your own kids.\n\nI\u2019m sorry OP but if they\u2019re taking three week family vacations instead of contributing towards the school fees then they *are* taking advantage of you.\n\nSure, they are trying to sell the business properties but that is for purely practical purposes.\n\nYou need to speak to them and tell them this can\u2019t go on. Give them the next semester so they have time to make some decisions, but after that it needs to be on them. They have taken advantage of your generosity and avoided reality long enough. \n\nYou need to act now otherwise before you know it you\u2019ll be paying for college.", "Businesses are not hard to sell right now. Not at all. There is a ton of capital out there looking for investment opportunities.\n\nBusinesses are hard to sell for too much money.

The fall is the perfect time to start at a new school. \n\nSimply say this situation isn\u2019t sustainable for you and it\u2019s not an option anymore.

Otherwise, welcome to public school kids! \n\nNTA.", "NTA They are not your kids and it's not your responsibility to keep paying anything for them.\n\nYour brother has assets that he needs to liquidate, but wants to hold onto them to see if they appreciate in value. They are using you as a short term loan facility that never has to be paid back.\n\nStop it.", "NTA, tell your brother that you are done paying. They will keep stringing you on. Next will be college and grad school.  Are you ready to pay for that?", "Ywnbta You are a terrific uncle, especially for helping with the special needs school, which can run as much as private universiy tuition.  Covid is done and tour brother needs to get his finances in order and make tough decisions.", "Ofc you're NAH. It does sound like you're a considerate person though who might have a soft heart, so I understand why you reached out for opinions.", "Yeah this person's brother is a knob. \n\nI really hope this person cuts the cord and tells them like hey I'll pay for one more year and that's it don't ever ask you for a huge amount of money again. It's been 3 years now and you've paid back not a cent.  \n\nIt's very clear to me that if this person doesn't cut the brother off they're going to have to fund their lifestyle and definitely and the brother will never forgive when the inevitable cutoff happens if broached too quickly. \n\nYwnbta. Nta. Your brother and his family are definitely thinking advantage of you.", "This. OP, tell them, \"I can no longer pay their schooling fees or give you money in any way after X date.\" Give them a warning, and stick to it.
