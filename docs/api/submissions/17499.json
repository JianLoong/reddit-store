{"id": 17499, "submission_id": "13kb1uv", "title": "WIBTA if I stopped paying for my niece and nephews' private school fees?", "selftext": "I am in the incredibly fortunate position to be in a substantially better financial position than my brother and sister-in-law. They have three school-age children - including one who is on the autism spectrum and attends a special needs school. All three children are enrolled in private schools - but also happen to live in areas with at least decent public options. (Although I\u2019m unclear about options for my autistic niece.)\n\nMy brother and sister-in-law own a small number of hotels and were doing quite well financially until COVID hit, with no real recovery in sight as small business owners. They\u2019re currently looking to sell the business. It is also worth noting that they are property-rich with multiple houses and cash-poor. In mid-2020, they reached out and asked if I could pay the private school fees for their kids. I have been very happy to do this - over the past three years, this has amounted to gifting them $100,000 to-date.\n\nMy brother claims it\u2019s a loan, but in my head it\u2019s truly a gift. If he never pays me back, I would be perfectly OK with it. I feel like if you lend money to family, you have to be prepared and OK with the idea of not getting paid back, so I already mentally prepared when I agreed to this. It\u2019s generally never been a big deal about this - mostly because I\u2019ve been genuinely happy to do it. This is not the problem.\n\nThe problem is that they keep asking for money - my brother recently called me up asking for me to pay for the next school year for them, as well. I can afford it but it is reaching a pretty material amount to me - I'm not made of money either. I also worry about the moral hazard that this creates - where they assume I will subsidize their lifestyle indefinitely. I think they are relying on me to defer making some harder choices in their lives and personal finances \u2013 for example, selling one of their extra houses or maybe considering public school choices, if they truly cannot afford private school. (I also admit being a little annoyed that they went on a 3-week family holiday in Florida last year while still asking me to fund school.) On the other hand, this really speaks to the life outcomes of my niece and nephews - I love them dearly and want the best for them.\n\nWhile I might choose to continue the arrangement (and i realize that would be just my choice), what are my moral obligations here?  WIBTA if I gave them a clear timeline - e.g., one more school year to be funded by me - so that they have enough time to plan ahead and make some thoughtful decisions about their personal finances and priorities? t also feels like just yanking the rug out from under them would be the wrong decision. Or would I be screwing up my niece and nephews' lives by playing the moral high ground with my brother and sister-in-law?  \n\n\nHelp!\n\nDoting Uncle", "created_utc": 1684350635, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13kb1uv/wibta_if_i_stopped_paying_for_my_niece_and/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you answered your own question, somewhat, in that you demonstrate the understanding that money + family is nuanced. It's perfectly reasonable to place deadlines to encourage end goals.

It is your money, and you can spend it however you would like. I think, you can still support them but helping with other things or maybe they should consider something more affordable.

If you were to continue funding this, it would only make sense for there to be some terms and expectations. \n\nWe send our children to a private school. This is a choice we make, and an opportunity we have that other people do not. We struggle to make ends meet while getting support from my parents. We could choose to send our kids to the local school district, yet believe our sacrifice is worth it. But, damn, it is painful. I say this not to complain, but to clarify that private school is a choice not a right. If I could sell an asset to cover the cost of tuition, I would do so in a heartbeat (I have sold some collectibles to cover tuition). \n\nIf I were you I would feel frustrated.

However, it has been a while now and I think it's time to think about other alternatives. Do keep me in the loop about your plans.

If they have multiple homes to sell and could afford a three week vacation in Florida, it sounds like they are taking advantage of this situation and you would be setting a precedent if you don\u2019t talk to them.

It would be a really nice thing to do to give them a year or have them pay for half this year and all next year but you're in no way obligated to do that. What an incredible thing to do your your nices and nephew.", "NTA - You have been overly generous, and hey are now taking you for granted.

Plus, for children without special needs, a good public school is every bit as good as a private school. And it sounds like they are wealthy enough to live in a district with good schools.\n\nThe autistic child is a bit of a different case. Even good districts often offer very little appropriate instruction for special needs children, and they make the parents spend a lot of money on lawyers to get them to pay for an appropriate private school. You are under no obligation to pay for the autistic child's private school, especially as it seems your sibling can afford to send the autistic child to private school if they put the other kids in public school.

Especially knowing they have properties and businesses they could  liquidate.\n\nBut is private school at elementary age that much better to justify the cost?
