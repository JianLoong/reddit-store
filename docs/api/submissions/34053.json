We don't share a bank account which is fine because I am self supporting to an extent HOWEVER, my husband never buys anything for the kids that's all me. This morning after being up every 2 hrs with our 1 year old ( typical night 4 me) I asked him to finally help so I can get some rest, this was at 6:30 and he had been asleep all night. So he gets up goes into the nursery and brings the screaming child into our bedroom where the 2yr old was sleeping waking him up. He does shit like this all the time, plays dumb like he doesn't know what to do and makes me have to do it. I've tried not helping him bit the only ones who suffer are my poor babies. He thinks feeding them cheese puffs is dinner and he only changes their diapers if it's leaking everywhere. When I finally said wtf are you good for he called me a Btch over and over again and threw clothes at me. How can someone with 4 kids still not know how to take care of them???!!!?? I'm exhausted, I never get any sleep I have to do all the work while he sits on his ass playing chess on his phone.

I will say that my judgement is ESH - you for not speaking up sooner, and for waiting until things boiled over and you reacted with rage (which will not fix the situation). And him for being a lazy parent. Tell him things have to change, and you both need couples counselling.", "NTA. He is useless. He is employing the technique called \"Weaponized Incompetence\". I would kick him to the curb, if I were you. He is neither helping nor supporting you and your children in any way. You would be better off divorced and making him pay some hefty child support.", "NTA. You need to pull him off of his phone and work out some details.  Talk to each other like grown ups.

He's weaponized incompetence and wants to be taken care of and not have responsibilities. He barely contributes anything. Why keep him?

Divorce him and you'll have less work and more financial support.", "Eh...pretty sure that if you divorced him you'd have one less child at hand, and probably much more money to take care of your children.  \nDo you really think having a useless husband and father around is benefitial to your kids?  \nThis is the relationship you show your children. The relationship they will model their own relationships after because this is all they know.  \nGirl, have some selfrespect for yourself.", "YTA for putting up with this", "NTA.

Honestly, stop buying anything for the kids that is not necessary, especially the older ones and tell them to ask your husband for any spending money.\n\nWhen he comes home from work, take off without the kids.  Tell the older kids that you're leaving for a bit (and also the husband, who likely won't hear it) and tell them they are on their own.", "NTA for that, but you are for putting up with this.", "Divorce him and get child support. You\u2019ll still do all the work but at least he\u2019ll be contributing financially!", "NTA- he\u2019s selfish and using weaponized incompetence to keep from having to do anything.", "A classic case of I get mine now give me yours. What a guy!", "Nta", "Why did you have 2 children with him if he was already useless on the first one?", "Nta.  He has a pretty sweet deal going, you do not.  Honestly you\u2019d probably have more money with child support and alimony.", "I want to so badly but I can't afford rent I don't make enough.. I've tried finding even shelters but it's insane in California rn.", "Oh I speak up, I communicate constantly, he shuts it down. I'd say my part is being blind and not paying attention to the red flags..", "I try he gets super angry and volatile. I've had 2 kids total and will not have anymore he's snipped now thank God.

My 15 yr is living with family because of behavioral issues and me not having any help from my husband with him, it was really bad. I get the kids food and clothing, and pay daycare. It's all necessary. And he uses that as a threat, he won't give me money to pay and I just can't pay or we won't have childcare. It's awful. He's a narcissistic ass", "That's the thing when I met him he wasn't, he was overly helpful, which I know see was a red flag... love bombing buying everything.. mfr tricked me. \nHe would slowly improve and then randomly stop helping. There's no consistency. And I had my 2 kids back to back.", "Instead of wondering how to do it because you couldn't afford to live on your own, just talk to a lawyer about your options. They will be able to tell you if your husband will have to pay  for anything or not.  \nBut most importantly if you can not afford California, then go look for an area that is more affordable for you. maybe closer to relatives that could help you out.", "Well, you know what to do then. If he won\u2019t go to counselling, then leave him.", "If he\u2019s a true narcissist, I\u2019m sorry to say there is very little hope of change.", "I'm sorry you're saddled with this.  Maybe the attorney might be a better first phone call (quietly get copies of any financial docs you can).  Good luck!", "If as you say he makes a shit ton more than you, he will have to pay child support.

If not: why having unprotected sex with him?", "Ya I have a feeling that's true. The only thing I can say is he doesn't cheat, I mean if he was he has to be a freaking ninja because I always find out.", "His mom is about an hr away but she doesn't really watch them either. I walked in to my 1 yr old eating a rock and she was aware and thought it was ok... lord help me.", "I'm an idiot! He starts to get better but then stops. I'm not having anymore but I'm stupid for ever thinking he would improve.", "He did in the beginning, but all the help and everything stopped once I was married and already had the kids. There's no consistency that's the issue. One min he's helpful then boom, he literally does nothing.", "What does it matter? What\u2019s done is done you don\u2019t need to be prying and asking why someone had kids, the kids were born and they exist and your questions are unhelpful and annoying.", "It matters because choices were made ;) kids don\u2019t just fall from the sky and the kids are the ones suffering here and not having a choice. \nTherefore I question why someone would have another kid with someone that, based on her words, already was not helpful with the first one. \n\nWhy continue to have kids with that person and then complain?", "I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re being attacked for asking some basic questions about why OP chose to have so many kids with this person and is now complaining about how this relationship is going. \n\nPeople do show you who they are if you let them. Some people think they can change the spouse. That usually backfires. \n\nBefore you come with your pitchforks, know that I am a mom of a 2.5 year old. The strain it has put on the relationship is not trivial. I can\u2019t imagine how much having 2 more kids would put on any relationship.\n\nOP - there is no way you didn\u2019t see this coming. I feel bad for you but also it\u2019s not surprising given the prior context.", "Are you 12? Do you not understand how men do this all the time? She answered your question - he played the bait-and-switch. It\u2019s not like he invented it. It happens all the time everywhere. \n\nWhat\u2019s with you jumping on her without saying a word about a worthless man?", "Did not jump on anyone. Just asked questions. He is a deadbeat 100% and indeed I am convinced that such a person will show his true colors in a myriad of small ways that people happily ignore to then be surprised they act exactly like that.\n\nDo not have children with people you barely know.", "Because she probably wanted more kids than he did, and is now complaining about his lack of parenting. Kids don\u2019t fall out of the sky, as this commenter said. It\u2019s the most \u201cnon 12 year old\u201d comment in this thread so far.", "You know none of that. Regardless it doesn\u2019t even vaguely matter. The kids are here, and you don\u2019t get to just opt out. He doesn\u2019t even help pay for daycare, and you\u2019re defending him? Pathetic. He\u2019s a deadbeat", "I didn\u2019t defend him one bit. Don\u2019t let Reddit rob you of your ability to make a nuanced argument."]}
