My brother (26M) is married and has 2 kids. My mom has always wanted grandkids and is very protective of my brother and his kids when it comes to arguments. And his youngest (5F) is very energetic and tbh quite stupid. But regardless me and her are pretty close and I love her no matter what. One day my brother and his wife got a babysitter for his youngest while his oldest was at her friends for the weekend so they could go on a date. The babysitter ended up canceling the day of and he and his wife decided to have date night at home while the youngest would stay in the front yard in view. My brother and his wife got things heated up and went to the bedroom and forgot about their youngest outside. I didn\u2019t get exact details but she ended up getting hit by the neighbors car while they were backing out. She was going alright but it caused permanent damage to her right ear. It\u2019s been 6 weeks and she\u2019s still in the hospital and my brother has been really isolated from everyone. I\u2019ve been helping taking care of his oldest so he could get on his feet. But one day my brother came out of his room and saw his wife sitting on the couch looking at photos of their youngest daughter. He ended up starting an argument and blaming her saying she should\u2019ve been a better mom and watching her. I stepped in and pushed him away from her face. I said that he was being irresponsible just like he was being irresponsible when watching their youngest kid. My mother has been contacting me since then about how I was being a bitch for no reason and that I could never know what my brother was going through. She has even came to my apartment and told me that I needed to apologize and that my brother will never forgive me. I don\u2019t honestly care about my brother forgiving me and it was his responsibility to look after his kid just as much as his wife\u2019s.
