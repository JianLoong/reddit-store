There was bright and colorful stuff hanged everywhere. She put little deer models on every shelf, little pine trees and gnomes on every window. Wrapped up the curtains with bows, put christmas mats infront of every door, gingerbread signs on the walls and doors, santa clause themed cups, plates and even pillows, containers stuffed with cookies and candycanes. it's just...it felt so nausuating to put it civily. I called her and had her get off work and come home immediately.\n\n\nWhen called out, her response was \"what? It was supposed to be a surprise, I thought you'd like it\" I said no because for one I'm an athiest I don't celebrate this holiday...or any other holiday for that matter but christmas in particular makes me anxious and gives me depression. And also....I did not give her my consent to turn the 0place upside down like that. She had a breakdown, began crying saying she put so much money and effort into decorating the place and said that lots of non religion people celebrate christmas as \"one of the country's largest holidays\". She said that even if I don't approve of it, she does and since she lives here and helps pay mortgage then she gets a say. I said \"WRONG\" because it's my place my house and she only moved in a couple of months ago. We had a huge (probably the biggest so far) argument and she went to stay with her friends and has yet to return nor respond to my calls. One of her friend did reach out and called me an \"asshole\" for how I reacted and for yelling at Mandy and making her feel bad for doing a \"nice gesture\" to make my home \"warm and lit\" this season. Ngl I laughed at the words she used but nontheless she might have a point in that I acted horribly tiwards Mandy.", "created_utc": 1668978222, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0f7xs/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_girlfriend_for/", "score": 1913, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you move someone in without telling them that certain things are triggers, then that's your issue. \n\nEven if she hadn't decorated the entire house, she could have worn a Christmas sweater or something and set you off too, so why did you never bring this up to her, especially right before a major holiday? \n\nAlso, please go to therapy if you're going to \"blow up\" over your triggers. You're an adult and need to learn how to manage them, not explode.", "YTA because of how you worded this. Did she know you don\u2019t celebrate Christmas? If so and out of mutual respect maybe she should have discussed decorating the house beforehand. However you invited her to live with you and she\u2019s paying rent so this is her space too. Your reaction was horrendous and could have been communicated like an adult where it sound like you threw a tantrum. If you want this relationship to continue you have some serious self reflection to do", "OP, you've made an error several times here. Mandy is your ex. It's clear to me and probably to her that she doesn't have a home- she's an unwelcome guest who is being handed a bill for her stay. Nobody with any self respect would stay with you.", "YTA. And also you're single now even if you don't realize it.\n\nBut if she lives there and pays rent she should be able to decorate for holidays unless that was rule you agreed to before cohabitation.", "YTA \n\n\n\nShe tried to do a nice thing and you had a total power tripping shit fit over it. Made her leave work so you could tell her off and scold her for decorating the house she lives in.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like her moving in after knowing you for such a short amount of time was a huge mistake, who could\u2019ve guessed?", "YTA and pulled the atheist card. Atheist here and happily celebrate Christmas. She lives there pays half the rent well she did till you were an AH.", "YTA\n\nShe moved in. It\u2019s her house too.\n\nBut how can something so big not be known to each of you BEFORE moving in? \n\nYou made her leave work to berate her for this? Something that could have waited until she got home for a calm discussion. \n\nBut at least you\u2019ve made it clear where she stands. She\u2019s not a partner. The house is yours. I hope she leaves", "You called and told her to get off work early to... to scold her? You told a working person to leave work, simply so you could yell at her, and in effect made her lose pay for the rest of that workday?\n\nBecause you scolding your girlfriend surely couldn't wait until later!\n\nAnd this power tripping shit is pissing me off. You essentially told her she has no say in her, by what I'm assuming your invitation to live in, home. So she's a guest then, temporarily living there and actively searching for a new home? Well, She is now at least.\n\nYou have absolutely no business living with another person if this is the treatment you give. \n\nShe could have asked first, sure. But your response is as bright red flags as Rudolph's nose is in the winter night.\n\nYTA.\n\nEdit: spelling", "YTA\n\n\"I had her come home\"\n\n\"I told her wrong, it's my place\"\n\n\"I yelled\"\n\nYou hate Christmas, that's fine, but nothing gives you the right to go off like that towards another person over decoration on top of that. You demanded her to come home from work to yell at her.\nMajor red flags here from your side!", "My first thought is YTA for how you talked to her about it. Did you tell he thar you absolutely despise Christmas and it triggers you? Also only dating a few months then moving in so fast you both don't know each well enough to get this upset about something. Learn how to communicate.", "YTA. I hope she becomes your ex soon.", "ytA....... If you're an atheist, you should let her know upfront when moving in, so that stuff like this wouldn't happen.  Also you're dating someone who celebrates holidays. Calm down scrooge.", "YTA, it\u2019d be one thing if you explicitly told her you don\u2019t celebrate or if you practiced a faith that doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas, but she had no reason to believe this would make you upset. Plenty of atheists celebrate Christmas.\n\nPlus, she\u2019s right she pays rent and does get a say in decor no matter how long she\u2019s been living there.", "YTA\n\nYou made her come home early from work to yell at her about some Christmas decorations? Seriously? \n\nI hope she leaves you and finds someone who appreciates her!", "YTA. She lives there too, she put a lot of effort into this, wanted to make it a surprise and you behave like a massive sphincter about it.  \nFor next year (assuming she keeps you) maybe have a chat about the extent of the decoration, but it\u2019s a shared household, not just you and yourself, and just because you don\u2019t celebrate Xmas doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t allowed either.", "YtA. She's paying rent, so it stopped being just your house. But this is good for her, now she knows what kind of ahole you are and she can break up with you and move out. Your house?... while she's putting money in for rent. Definitely the ahole.", "WRONG YTA. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t an emergency, she didn\u2019t need to leave work. Also when it\u2019s a shared space, regardless of who\u2019s name is on the paperwork, both parties should get a say. Do you even want her to feel at home? \n\nI feel like you can compromise and ask her to tone it down some or contain it to certain rooms - assuming you aren\u2019t Scrooge.", "Yta for putting \u201cmy house\u201d in the title, while in reality she also used to live there too, and she was trying to make it feel like it was also her home. I use past tense, because I assume you too will break up, since you clearly don\u2019t accept her as an equal member of the household. \nIt\u2019s not that she renovated the house irrevocably, she added stuff that can easily be removed. \nEven if you hate the holidays because of trauma, you could have communicated it better. \nBut it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you live together and you don\u2019t consider this your (yours and hers) home even if it is your sole property. \nBtw, I call BS on the atheist thing, I have Muslim friends who put up a tree and give presents to their kids, so you could absolutely be happy for her, because putting the stuff up made her happy. Yta, did I say it already?", "YTA. You made your girlfriend leave work early and then berated her.. because she put up Christmas decorations? Wtf is wrong with you. Even if you disagreed with her doing that, she clearly was doing it as a nice thing. If it freaks you out so much, you have a conversation with her when she gets home like an adult\u2026 and then you two agree on decor for the house.", "YTA about a thousand times, it\u2019s not her fault that you\u2019re heartless and lacks in holiday spirit, btw I\u2019m an atheist myself and Christmas as we celebrate is not very christian\u2026", "YTA I hope she remains free of you. If she pays rent, it's her home too and she has a right to decorate if she wants.", "YTA.\n\nShe was trying to be kind, had no idea about your \u201cSanta  PTSD\u201d and you blew up on her to the extreme.\n\nI\u2019m a third generation atheist and still decorate for most holidays, just for the fun of it.\n\nShe\u2019s right again, it is also her place if she\u2019s moved in.\n\nGet some therapy, and some more joy and less anger in your life.", "YTA - if you invited her to move in and she pays rent than it is in fact her home too.  Now if you had had a civil discussion after she returned from work about maybe scaling back I would say N-A-H, but you called her home from work (she either lost income, or at the very least looked bad in her employers eyes for leaving in the middle of a shift) so that you could yell at her.  This puts you squarely in asshole territory.", "YTA.\n\nYour ex - and she\u2019s definitely an ex now - had a misunderstanding about decorating and holidays in general. It happens, especially when you\u2019re still learning to live with each other.\n\nBut instead of talking to her as a partner and compromising you treated her like she doesn\u2019t matter. You treated her like she has no power in the relationship. She doesn\u2019t get a say, at all, ever? \n\nBe honest - do you even like your ex? Because I don\u2019t understand how someone could see something clearly done out of love, even if it\u2019s misguided, and be so upset. \n\nOr is the real issue that you were angry and hurt that your partner didn\u2019t know you well enough? If so, why not address *that* instead of being stubborn?", "YTA - Athiesm isn't Jehovah's Witness where anyone expects that you don't celebrate holidays which are mostly built up over social aspects and not actual religious ones, and most Christmas traditions aren't even tied to religious aspects at this point - specifically decorations like Santa.\n\nIf you're triggered over twinkle lights and candy canes, you should have brought it up before you moved her in. Especially since she's paying rent and actually does get an opinion in her atmosphere.", "It's OK - you already gave your gf the best gift of all - finding out what a dick you are before she gets too deeply involved. YES YTA!", "YTA, she lives there. That means it's her place too now. As an atheist I love Xmas, it's really easy to take religion out of it, too.", "YTA. When she moved in it was no longer just your house\u2026 I hope she runs.", "You had her come home early so you could yell at her about decorations in yalls house?\n\nYTA. \n\nHow hard is it to be like \"I don't like Christmas or celebrate it, can we tone down the decorations some?\"", "YTA it sounds like you aren\u2019t ready to live with anyone. You clearly still consider it just your place. Seems like you both rushed too fast into living together", "YTA - another atheist here. You invited her to live with you. That makes it her home too, and for her the warm fuzzy holidays have a place in her life. Instead of being happy enough she didn\u2019t ask YOU to help with the decor, you made it clear to her that your house was NOT her home too\u2026.and that NO, you were not ready to share a life.\n\nAt most, you could have asked her to dial it back a touch. Instead, you went nuclear. Insisting she interrupted her workday (money? Not a priority? No?), so you could have a full blown fit.\n\nYou are not ready to share.", "Biggest fight not just so far but ever because YTA and she will dump you", "YTA and mean.  I think she can deal with you having a different opinion about Christmas but you are mean when you fight.  You made certain to let her know that she\u2019s living in YOUR house and you rule the roost.  I will be surprised if she comes back beyond returning to get her things.  You were very clear how she\u2019s inferior to you in this relationship and that when pushed, you are mean.  To me, I will never stay with someone if they fight mean.  This points to character, or lack of.  I hope she knows to take care of herself.  Things will only get worse for her if she stays.", "YTA - if she pays rent, it's her place too.\n\nAlso, did she know you hated Christmas?", "YTA. Ugh sounds like she moved in before you all really got to know each other.  Christmas is clearly important to her and you belittled something she strongly believes.  You have your beliefs as well and seems like you all need to discuss if you are going to move forward.  Also if she is paying rent it\u2019s not fair to play the it\u2019s MY house card.  It needs to be up for discussion like two adults.", "YTA completely. For some decorating for the holidays is something they look forward to all year. Sounds like she's one of those people & there's nothing wrong with it. Since it brings her so much happiness she wanted to share that joy with you. It was a big deal to her.\n\nThe way you made her leave work and tell her that it's your home only is so disrespectful. Don't be shocked if she never speaks to you again. She deserves a partner who sees her as an equal.", "The atheism thing shouldn't matter -- I'm a very non religious Jew but my wife decorates for Christmas (she is a non religious Christian) and I don't care. \n\nWith that being said, you still have a right to care and hate Christmas and whatever and that's fine. \n\nBut it's obvious that given the work that was put in and the timing of it (while you were away) she was clearly doing it as a surprise for you and you should have recognized that. \n\nYTA for the way you reacted. Making her leave work as if there was some kind of family emergency is a dick move. \n\nYou should have told her you respect the effort she put in but you don't believe in celebrating Christmas and that you want her to tone down the decorations. At that point, you could have left some up, and then either returned or donated the rest of them. \n\nBut in all honesty, this relationship probably isn't going to work out. If she is obsessed with Christmas to the point where she wants to turn the house into a Christmas fantasy land, and you want to pretend Christmas doesn't exist, that's kind of a big deal. I know Christmas is only one day a year but Christmas is the most important time of the year for a very large group of people and clearly it's a very important holiday to your girlfriend. So if something super important to her, makes you so angry that you force her to leave work early to scold her, I think it's time to move on from this relationship. It just isn't going to work IMO.", "You made her leave work early so that you could yell at her. THAT makes YTA all by itself.   \n\nAs to the rest of it, you should probably have had the holidays discussion before you ever moved in together. If you never expressed how much you were opposed to the celebration of Christmas, how was she to know? A lot of people do have secular Christmases. Second, it also sounds like you have been less than clear about your living situation. If she lives there and pays rent to live there, she should have some expectation of a voice on how the house is managed. If she's that WRONG, as you put it, then she needs to get the hell out of there fast, because the two of you are not on the same page.  You are behaving like an Asshole and she does deserve better.", "YTA -\n\nYou couldn't even see past your \"nausea\" that she probably did this to surprise you and thought that this was something nice & \"happy\" to greet you upon your return home. \n\nYou immediately called her to come home from work for this?! The house wasn't on fire, there was no real emergency - you were throwing a tantrum and called her to come home *from her job* so you could yell at her for something she spent a lot of time and money on as a loving gesture for you.  WTF dude?  You REALLY don't see that you may be being the AH here?  \n\nHad you previously communicated your distain for the holiday to her?  Then you also dismiss her wanting some holiday cheer telling her that it's YOUR house, not hers. Even though you invited her to move in and live with you - so is she just a tenant there at your goodwill and not entitled to have a say in temporary decor or anything else around the house?  \n\nI could you go on, but really...if you can't see and admit by now that YES yta and owe her a BIG apology then nothing I or anyone else on this thread says will enlighten you. \n\nIf you can't get over this be prepared to have the house back to yourself soon.", "YTA. WTF, dude. It\u2019s her home too now.", "YTA. She lives there too. How was she supposed to know you hated Christmas? She was trying to do a nice thing for you and make the house look nice. \n\nHave a nice time finding another girlfriend", "Yes another man believing he has the final say in everything in the relationship. She would be wise to leave you, you sound miserable and lacking as a partner", "Yta for making her leave work over this.", "YTA. I\u2019m also an Atheist so I believe it\u2019s Jesus birthday just about as much as I believe Santa is real. I still enjoy the holiday and my house is one of the most decorated in the neighborhood. \n\nThere is no good excuse for treating your GF like this. Calling her home from work and yelling is a total dick move. You yelled about holiday decor? It makes you depressed and anxious? Get some help and some perspective. Your reaction is neither healthy, mature, nor justified. Lighten up.", "You called and forced her to leave work and come home? Then says just because she pays rent she doesn\u2019t have a say because she moved in a few months ago? There a bigger issues than you just being an asshole in this situation", "YTA. Enjoy being single for the holidays. \nYou said she moved in with you AND pays rent so doesn\u2019t that make it her house as well regardless of how long she has resided there? \nDid she damage anything in the home? Have you expressed prior to today your dislike for Christmas? \nInstead of yelling at her while she was at work, to earn money to pay rent to you, couldn\u2019t you have waited until she came home and said, \u201cHey hun the decorations are lovely but a little overwhelming could we maybe compromise and only decorate xyz room or something g?\u201d", "YTA for sure. There was absolutely no need to over react and you calling it your house when she lives there and pays rent is just petty and rude. She did something sweet that she thought would make you happy and you couldn't even say thank you then calmly tell her you don't celebrate Christmas so would prefer to take the bulk of the decorations down. Also who the heck doesn't celebrate Christmas?! She deserves better than you, hopefully she will see that.", "YTA. I\u2019m an atheist as well, but many of us still celebrate the secular \u201cChristmas\u201d. Unless she was aware of your strong feelings or you celebrated another religious holiday during this time that she was aware of, you majorly overreacted. Plus she pays rent, so she has some say here. Grow up.", "YTA - this isn\u2019t a normal reaction and as such you shouldn\u2019t expect people to automatically read your mind and know this about you. Communicate better next time.", "Hard YTA.\n\nThe apology better be a good one. Because wow you come off terrible, and this is YOUR side of the story", "YTA. It\u2019s not your apartment anymore. She lives there too. I hope she dumps your ass and gets with someone that appreciates her effort.", "Well congratulations on becoming single again. You are absolutely the asshole. If she\u2019s paying rent she has a say in decor. If Christmas decorations really trigger you that much you need a therapist", "YTA. Did you ever have a conversation about holidays with her? You asked her to leave work early so you could yell at her like a little kid? It seems like you have some shit to work out if Christmas makes you depressed. Talk it out with a therapist and don't take it on your girlfriend who thought she could bring in some warmth to your could ass heart.", "You\u2019re a complete dumbass", "I guess that's what happens when you move in with a girl you've only been seeing for a few months. You made her rush home from work for this? YTA.", "YTA.  I loathe xmas, however I'd never stop anyone putting up decorations.\n\nWhen you next go to work come home and find no decorations or any of her stuff I hope you realise how pathetic  your stance was.", "YTFA.", "YTA. You sound insufferable.", "YTA\n\nI seriously hope she dumps your miserable ass. You're rude and fcking insensitive.", "\"This girl\" is a great way to refer to your live-in girlfriend.\n\nYou moved in together without discussion of religious preferences, holidays? You two haven't spent a Christmas (or any other traditionally Christian holiday for that matter) together and you've moved in?\n\nYTA. Not only are you a jerk to your girlfriend, but your communication skills are far too immature to have an adult relationship.", "YTA, you pulled her from work so you could yell and berate her. If you don\u2019t like Christmas, you should\u2019ve told her that before you moved in together. Based off this post, it sounds like you two are incompatible. You should apologize to her and try and repair your relationship if it isn\u2019t already permanently damaged and it sounds like it might be.", "YTA\nShe pays rent and she has every right to decorate without your permission. She probably did it because it's your first major holiday living together and she wanted to make a nice memory with you too and you shat on her. You shat on her more telling her she has no decision making power either when it comes to living with you. I would fucking bounce and let you be miserable. \nGrow the hell up.", "1. Why did you feel it\u2019s appropriate for you to call and demand your girlfriend to leave work early? Unwanted Christmas decorations are not an emergency. Get a grip.\n\n2. You invited your S/O to live with you, which makes it her house as well. \n\n3. My wife and I are not religious, but she loves to decorate for the holidays. She doesn\u2019t put up anything with religious connotation, just snowflakes and lights and deer. So really, the atheist aspect isn\u2019t an excuse on your part, either. \n\nGonna go with YTA here, OP. Use this as a learning experience and learn how to communicate with your girlfriend.", "I also hate Xmas. But you can find a compromise and that starts with a civil and calm discussion. Your ego blows.", "YTA you\u2019re insufferable \u201cI laughed at the words she used but nonetheless\u201d I hope Mandy leaves you for somebody better.", "YTA \nYou seriously made her leave work for your tantrum?

Being an atheist doesn\u2019t automatically mean you don\u2019t celebrate any holidays I\u2019m atheist too I just don\u2019t celebrate the religious aspect of the holidays but this is absolutely something that should\u2019ve been discussed before you started living together. Honestly between you making her leave work just so you could throw your tantrum at her and calling it just your house even though she lives there and pays rent it all just shows that you don\u2019t have any respect or consideration for her hopefully she sees that herself and leaves you to your house by yourself.", "YTA you could have asked her to tune it down a little and maybe do I little trimming down together not a big deal", "YTA \nShe is paying rent - why wouldn\u2019t she have a say? \n\nHope girlfriend moved out and on from you.

I insist, YTA.", "YTA. If you don't want your house decorated for Christmas that's certainly a discussion you can have with your girlfriend, but she definitely gets a say. She lives there now, regardless of whether she pays rent she gets a say because you're romantically involved. You forcing her to come home from work early, yelling at her, telling her \"WRONG\" etc. that's just being an AH. Don't move in with people if you need your precious house to stay exactly as is.", "YTA. This atheist right here loves decorating for Christmas. Don\u2019t act like she should have automatically known you didn\u2019t want to decorate. \n\nYou\u2019ve putting off creepy patriarchal vibes. Your house, even though she pays rent. You get to make all the decorating decisions, even though she cares more. Demanding she come home from her little woman job so you can lecture her like a child for displeasing you. Ick!", "YTA Grinch. I\u2019m sure your ex will find someone kind next tho.", "YTA.  At the worst you could have just undecorated it.", "YTA. You could have handled this a lot better. Hopefully she\u2019ll take the decorations and leave your grinch a$$", "YTA. I\u2019m an atheist and don\u2019t care about Xmas in the slightest, but you best believe I wouldn\u2019t shit on my partner if this display made them happy. As long as I don\u2019t have to participate, cool beans. Though, one would imagine that with the holidays coming, there would have been a discussion, and if might have been a good idea to casually scoff at Xmas decorations at the store before Halloween if you weren\u2019t ready for a \u201cserious\u201d conversation about it.", "Holy shit dude, YTA. If Mandy has any sense, you'll be living through the holidays alone this year. You have disregarded all of her feelings about the holiday as well as any rights she has in Y'ALLS home. Not just yours. She lives there, it's her home too. She tried to do something fun and sweet and you reacted like a self centered prick.", "I\u2019ll start by saying I don\u2019t think you owe anyone gratitude for something they did without you asking, but you should have at least tried to be respectful of the sincerity behind her gesture. Unless you already explicitly told her your feelings on Christmas, she had no way of knowing it was a trigger and your extreme reaction would only make sense in a situation where she was deliberately trampling on your boundaries. What definitely pushes you into asshole territory is calling her to leave work, and then treating her as if the home she pays to live in is not her home. It isn\u2019t like she totally renovated your place while you were away\u2014they\u2019re just decorations which are easily boxed up. If she is your girlfriend, she\u2019s more than a roommate, she\u2019s also your partner. That alone would send up redflags to me, and I would dump you asap if I were her. YTA.", "YTA. \n\nShe is not a child you get to reprimand. \n\nI sincerely hope she dumps you and finds a partner who doesn't gleefully recall calling her home from work to tell her how WRONG she is.", "YTA so much. Had you shared your disdain for Christmas with her or did you assume that she\u2019d just know? The whole atheist thing is absolutely useless because it\u2019s become as much of a secular holiday as a non secular holiday in western countries. Also, if she\u2019s LIVING there and PAYING RENT, she\u2019s damned right that she has a say in the decorating. You\u2019re a Scrooge and what I glean from this post, likely an insufferable person to be around in general. I hope she runs for the hills and leaves you to stew in YOUR house all alone. YTA and Merry Christmas!", "YTA. Christmas doesn\u2019t have anything to do with religion for a lot of people. My husband and I are both atheist and I still decorate our house to make it feel Cheerful and to celebrate the holidays. You\u2019re a grinch.

So you fucked up on accepting something deeply personal and emotionally intimate with your partner, *and* you threw this *actually really nice gesture* in her face.\n\nThe appropriate way to talk about this would have been to have a conversation, like an adult.  That's where you would say that you can see it's really important to her, that you appreciate her putting in *so much time and work to make your shared home nicer,* and that it was a really kind thing, and that you have complicated feelings about it because of your relationship with the holidays.  That's how you'd start that conversation.  But instead?\n\nShe didn't have a breakdown, dude.  *You* had a breakdown, and your ex had a very reasonable reaction to you being fucking awful.\n\nAlso, you're super fucking wrong about her not being allowed to decorate.  She's living there?  Legally, she's a tenant.  You can keep bullying her into tearing down her decorations (assuming she ever speaks to you again, which, doubt it) but she is ethically, morally, and most importantly *legally* completely in the clear.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, how was she supposed to know that you wouldn't like Christmas decorations? Unless you explicitly told her, her idea to decorate the house was very logical, since the vast majority of people does actually like that (at least to some extent).\n\nSecondly, after you saw what she'd done and didn't like it, your reaction could have been so much better. Just wait until she gets home, then have a mature conversation about it. Thank her for doing it (it was done with the right intentions, after all, she wanted to surprise you and thought you'd like it), then indicate how you don't really celebrate Christmas and why that is, maybe ask her to remove a bit of it if you think it was over the top. But whatever you do, talk it out together, acknowledge the effort she put in (once again: TO SURPRISE YOU), and move from there.\n\nFinally, your remark about her not having a say cements the judgement for me. She's living there as your girlfriend and pays rent for it, so of course she gets a vote in what happens in a living room. After all, since she's paying rent for it, it's sort of her house too.\n\nOP, please apologize to her, have a mature conversation about it, indicate your feelings while acknowledging her effort, and then try to find out how to proceed.

I find it maybe a little weird that you live together and it\u2019s never come up that you don\u2019t celebrate or decorate for Christmas or that it gives you such strong negative feelings? Should she have maybe said something before spending a ton of money on stuff to decorate? Maybe, but she was trying to do something nice and there were much calmer and rational ways to have addressed this issue without blowing up on her and telling her she\u2019s wrong for telling you she has a say in that kind of thing because she lives there too because, well, she does.

I hate Christmas so much (trauma reasons). Decor bothers me a lot and that's why I discuss it with whoever I live with so we can compromise and even then I just suck it up and go to my room which is a safe haven.

Forcing her to come home from work just to yell at her for decorating your (and I mean BOTH of yours) place?? She didn\u2019t put nativities everywhere, she put stereotypical NOT RELIGIOUS Christmas stuff everywhere. She in no way disrespected you and thought you\u2019d love it.

She spent a small fortune to make you happy, yep make YOU happy. Your response, screaming that it isn't her place also. Well, that is probably true now. You just couldn't let her be happy and share that joy? I call BS on the I don't celebrate Christmas trash talk. So you don't enjoy gifts or making others happy, no family and pie? Ok, Scrooge. You had better control your anger and make a massive effort to apologize. I wish you all the best, you will need it.", "YTA I'm atheist I still celebrate Christmas cause fun fact it's not even about \"god\" it's the winter solstice it was just taken over by the Catholics cause heaven forbid every holiday not be about god your being a complete dick to your (hopefully ex) gf for no reason I think you need some therapy op if you call people out of work and scream at them for trying to do something nice.", "Are you the Grinch? \n\nI mean, I wanted to call you that, but honestly I don't think you have a heart.

It was a nice gesture. Misplaced, but nice. Your reaction was over the top, and it's due to the fact that you made her leave her job so you can tell her how much you hate it and make her feel small. She pays rent, so she should be able to make choices to decorate. It might extra, but given your Scrooge outlook I'm guessing that it's not that bad. You could have waited until she got home from work and at least been nice about it. You two could have come to a compromise; maybe that she could decorate but with more general winter themes as opposed to direct Christmas.

You\u2019re absolutely YTA.\n\n1. I\u2019m an atheist and I fucking love Christmas. \n\n2. She put time, money and effort into it.\n\nAnd 3. The biggest problem of all. It\u2019s not YOUR place.

She pays to live there, you said that. YTA.", "YTA\n\nCouple of things \n\nTypical Christmas decorations are nothing to do with the religious story of Christmas the trees are actually related to old druidic traditions. There were no deer in Bethlehem There were no Gnomes, elves, candy canes ginger bread or Christmas trees or Santa in Bethlehem. \n\nSo Atheism is a rubbish excuse. If you have genuine issues around Christmas you should have explained them. \n\nShe also pays rent so she lives there. It isn't just your house anymore. If she is not allowed to have any input then she is a guest and shouldn't have to pay rent. \n\nI suspect that your GF wanting to have a say or doing things in the home she lives in with you will no longer be a problem. \n\nFor the future reference...You are either clear before hand and talk about how you navigate the issue together or if you fail to do that you suck it up and you go with it for the occasion and make sure you come to a sensible compromise next time.

Why would she want to continue to live there if she\u2019s essentially a guest who can\u2019t even decorate for a holiday that clearly matters to her.

Wtf my dude. \nThis has nothing to do with being atheist and everything with being controlling. It\u2019s her home now too but you still act like it\u2019s all yours.

I get that she moved into your place.

You couldn\u2019t have waited for her to get home and calmly spoken to her, saying that, while you appreciate the effort, you need to be comfortable in your space as well and maybe this isn\u2019t comfortable for you??\n\nInstead, you treated her like someone you don\u2019t don\u2019t value as a partner, stating this is your space only not hers. Of course she left and isn\u2019t answering your calls. You acted like a giant asshole. \n\nI know plenty of people who are not religious, or a religion that doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas, and they still like to decorate their home for the \u201choliday season\u201d. What she did is not unreasonable at all. But your reaction to her is unreasonable.\n\nYou owe her a giant apology. You also need to think about whether this is a person who you deserve. Because right now I feel like she could find someone a lot better who will appreciate her. Someone who won\u2019t throw a hissy fit because she decorated for Christmas? This is the craziest hill to die on I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nJust to reiterate, YTA", "Fellow atheist here.  Your behavior was absolutely abominable.  What was the purpose of having her move in with you if you aren't going to allow it to be your home too?  Not that it matters in this case because you are almost certainly single now.  But maybe get some therapy and do better with the next person you date.  YTA", "Man, what a crazy way to respond.  YTA. Christmas isn\u2019t just a religious holiday.  It\u2019s the most popular holiday in North America because it\u2019s about coming together with family and friends, about spreading joy, and goodwill towards all men.

You don't sound like a very nice person and you don't sound invested in the relationship.

She\u2019s not a mind-reader and tried to do something nice for you. Thirdly, while not everyone feels Christmas is a secular holiday, a lot of people do celebrate the season without having a religious connection to it. If that\u2019s not how you feel about it you\u2019re entitled to that opinion, however it deserved a calm discussion with your partner and taking her beliefs, thoughts and opinions into account as well.\nAlso, you say you\u2019ve been seeing her \u201cfor a few months\u201d but that she\u2019s been living with you \u201cfor a couple of months.\u201d Honest question, Did you take the time to find out about your partner and her family traditions and feelings about holidays before moving in with her?

I hope you enjoy being single.", "YTA if she pays rent then she has the right to decorate to make it feel more like home for her.

There was no emergency, except in your own mind, that required her to leave her job early.

OP YTA. If I were her I would run now.", "Plus he called her and ordered her to leave work to come listen to his whiny grinch rant. What an asshole.", "Also the whole it is my house. That doesn\u2019t work in a partnership. She moved in. She lays rent. Yall are a couple. She gets a say. Now if you own the home and we are talking permanent changes maybe not but cosmetic or decorative definitely", "Let\u2019s HOPE she is an ex.", "I am agnostic and my GF is Atheist and we still exchange gifts on XMAS. Even out up a tree lol.", "The atheist in my family is also the biggest Christmas traditionalist. It\u2019s not a matter of faith.\n\nOP\u2019s anxiety and depression around Christmas is a different matter, but there\u2019s no reason his GF could have intuited that from his atheism. And it doesn\u2019t matter how long she\u2019s been living there; *she lives there*. I think she\u2019s also TA for going ahead with a massive decor overhaul without checking with him, but he\u2019s worse for trying to pull \u201cmy house my rules\u201d when it\u2019s also her home. And TA even more for treating it as a come-home-right-this-minute emergency!", "That would be rational. Which OP clearly is not.", "Yeah, my husband and I are agnostic/ atheist and he celebrates *hardcore* for Christmas.", "Not just yelled at her. He demanded she \"leave work early* so he could give her a dressing down.", "Be nice he's a depressed atheist this time of year because he is making family holidays all about their religious origins. You should see OP in March and April because he is afraid every Sunday maybe Easter.", "This is what makes YTA", "It's not even just his house - they live together and she pays her half of the expenses. It's THEIR home. Ridiculous reaction on his part, even if she was over the top about it.", "It's his house though, she's just supposed to help pay rent, cook for him, clean for him and be his sex slave. Duh!", "That was the part that really got me. Having someone leave work and come home immediately for anything other than a serious emergency is a big barrier to cross in my mind. Having someone do it because of decorations?  Something that could easily be dealt with later. OP is a huge AH and clearly does not view his partner as an equal and isn't even affording her a basic level of curtesy and respect as an independent adult.", "Also, most Christmas decorations are pagan in origin. I don\u2019t see any mentions of nativity sets or crosses, just things people have done for thousands of years to make the winter more bearable.", "Seriously if his aversion to Christmas was so strong a conversation should have been had with the holidays coming up fast. I am also atheist and I love me some Christmas lights and decorations.", "I\u2019m an atheist and christmas is my favorite holiday. I celebrate \u201cSanta christmas\u201d not \u201creligious christmas\u201d. The same way some kids can get easter baskets and hunt for eggs but the parents don\u2019t tie any religious stuff in there. \n\nI love lights and sparkles and giving/making gifts and hanging out with my parents and drinking and snacking. I love feeling cozy because it\u2019s colder outside and warm inside and I\u2019ve got the house smelling like spiced apples and lights twinkling\u2026 ain\u2019t none of that have anything to do with religion for me, I just like to have a nice time haha.\n\nEdit: YTA", "This exactly!\n\n >I feel like y'all should've had conversations around holidays and celebrations before cohabiting\n\nWhy are you living with with someone who you have never even communicated your views about holidays with?!?!?", "This. Having her leave work so you could yell at her about decor is TA move for me.", "Yes!!! It\u2019s one thing to voice your opinion about not celebrating Christmas or not wanting decorations. But you decided to make your gf feel unwelcome and unappreciated in your SHARED apartment, when she was just trying to do something nice for you both", "OP is straight acting like Ebenezer Scrooge", "Hell, there's nothing worse that putting time, love and effort (and even money in this case!) into a gesture of goodwill and affection only to have someone throw it back in your face.", "AND HE MADE HER LEAVE WORK??? \n\nGood thing she\u2019ll be saving $$$ by being single on Christmas so she doesn\u2019t need the hours as badly.", "I\u2019ve dated and met plenty of atheists and approximately zero of them would freak out over Christmas decorations to the point where they demand someone **leave work early** to berate them about it.", "A lot of atheists celebrate Christmas. Even growing up Catholic, Christmas was about family and not religion. It feels as secular as the Fourth of July to me.", "This. I thought edgy, hardline atheism went out of style in like 2010.", "Hallmark movie guy has entered the chat.", "Tbh, I never really think of it as a Christian holiday. I just like the change and atmosphere of the day with all the lights and stuff.", "OP wanted an on demand fuck buddy and help with the rent. Not a partner. Not even a roommate.", "Worse. The grinch had Max at least.", "Scrooge maybe? Before he had his epiphany. I\u2019m not a fan of Xmas either but what a f**king humbug!!", "Same. If anything I embrace that stuff even more because there's nothing religious about reindeer and gingerbread. The popular culture around Christmas is already so distant from actual Christianity that it hardly crosses my mind", "Absolutely", "Same here! Also, Hanukkah decor is pretty abysmal lol why would I deny myself sparkly lights? My great-grandpa, an orthodox raised Jewish immigrant, even did a Christmas tree once and hid it in the back of the house so his friends wouldn\u2019t judge lol. He just wanted to see what the fuss was about! I mean, the trees are so dang festive!", "All my Jewish friends would come over to my house on Christmas Eve for a big party and we always went over for Chanukah when I was a kid", "Agnostic here, and I love all of the blue and silver wrapping paper around Chanukah time! I grab as much of it that\u2019s non-specific (nothing religious on it) as I can for gifts for my family and friends (most of whom are Christian). It\u2019s such a pretty wintry color combo.", "COOKIES!!", "Also Jewish, but my Bf has a Christmas tree and you can bet the Christmas tree and my menorah are already up right now.", "I'm an atheist and my family have had a lot of death around xmas (her father and 2 great grandparents dies around the holidays 4 years ago) even we decorate for it. It helps us actually.", "Same! I\u2019m in my 40s and second generation atheist and absolutely love decking all my halls with Christmas decorations. You don\u2019t have to be religious to appreciate a holiday centered around a celebration of life and joy in a season of cold death.", "OP also mentions his girlfriend also pays rent, but she doesn't get a say in any of this? Like, what kinda fucking backward logic is that? \n\nShe helps with the rent? She gets a say in it and the OP is a huge asshole for reacting like this. I seriously hope that girl findsa better man...", "She needs to stay out. This guy has serious anger issues.", "Yeah it sounds like OP wanted convenient access to his gf but was not actually ready to cohabitate with a partner.", "It is controlling abuser behavior and brought back some not very fun memories for me.", "Yeah, that part made me raise my eyebrows past my hairline. \n\nOkay, so you don\u2019t want Christmas everywhere. That\u2019s fair. But is it worth affecting someone\u2019s day and job over it? Naw. \n\nSounds like OP needs to go to therapy. I hated Christmas a lot because it reminded me of very stressful family times, and never decorated or participated. Now that I\u2019m on the downhill slope of my healing hill, I actually put up a tree and enjoy my time with loved ones.", "Right? OP sounds like a nightmare honestly.", "What stood out to me is his first sentence: \u201cthis girl Mandy.\u201d Who refers to their partner who they\u2019re living with like that?", "\u201cMaking\u201d his new gf do anything made me think this was fake.", "Yeah this really stood out to me as well. Like WOW.", "Disrespectful yes. But also controlling and WAY overblown for the situation. If he\u2019s going to force her to come home from work and rip her a new one over decor, what the hell is he going to do her if she actually makes a mistake. This behavior will only escalate.", "I\u2019m an atheist and I love Christmas. I just focus on the Santa part and the nostalgia.", "YTA\n\nWay to make your (ex) gf feel so unwelcome.", "Was she just supposed to be his live in bang maid?", "boxing day (day after christmas) is a muslim's Christmas", "I am Jewish, and I have my own bin of Christmas decorations! My Husband and stepkids aren\u2019t Jewish. Celebrating the secular traditions of Christmas with them is so much fun.", "Yup. I'm agnostic. There's nothing wrong with making your house festive for the different seasons. It's a nice change of pace.", "And the Grinch realized he was wrong.", "Exactly! I\u2019m not putting up cr\u00e8ches or Jesus decorations. I put up snowflakes and lights and a tree. With my non religious ornaments.", "Same here. Way to go OP for taking a kind thoughtful gesture for your FIRST Xmas living together and forever leaving the stain on any future Xmas. Even if you didn\u2019t like it, there\u2019s a way to kindly request that it isn\u2019t repeated due to your beliefs - YTA you Xmas grinch.", "My grandparents are Jewish and put up a 7ft tall tree covered in ornaments every year because my grandma wanted an excuse to have pretty ornaments...", "Also \"dating this Girl \"Mandy\" for a few months\"? - that is how he talks about the partner he is serious enough about to let her move in? Wow.", "EXACTLY! I couldn\u2019t believe that either. Op wants a roommate who keeps everything in a bedroom and just uses outside amenities occasionally and not a partner!", "Same. Like the time I bought a pink towel and was told I couldn't hang it in the bathroom because it didn't match the poop brown colour scheme.  Wtf.", "Same. Spent decades trying to make miserable men's lives bright and happy. \\*barf\\*", "And you would think if he's serious enough for her to move in he would have told her his feelings on holidays?", "Same, and I know many other atheists that also love Christmas. We just leave out the nativity scenes and such when we decorate and don\u2019t bring any religious sentiments into the holiday season.", "Same here. I'm an atheist and love snowman-themed decorations in particular. My ex-husband was a Buddhist and celebrated/decorated as well, and the highlight of the season for me is helping the animal shelter with their \"pet pics with Santa\" fundraiser. Seeing OP pull that atheist card made me cringe.", "Yeah, that was an instant red flag", "moving in after a few months alone is an uh oh for me", "I thought the same thing", "The only thing I'd say is the anxiety thing around Christmas and Christmas decorations is real. But he could have approached this more sensitively - kindly explaining how he felt AFTER she came home from work. Saying it's not her place is an AH move too - for sure.", "Sounds like he just wanted the rent money and in-house booty."]}
