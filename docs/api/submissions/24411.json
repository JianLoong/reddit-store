You all need to sit down and decide what to do as in you and your wife need to talk first about giving your son some bills and responsibilities. (W/o yelling or high tense emotions and blaming) Also sounds like you all need to live in a roommate situation not as a parents/son situation which is much different meaning no shared spaces, clear cut boundaries. You stay in your space I stay in mine. No food sharing. Your son is an AH for getting so defensive because there was no way for you to know that the food was out of bounds because it was in your kitchen. \n\nNot everything should lead to DIVORCE. Unless there are other marital problems. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m not saying immediate NTA is because you lost your cool at the end. But we can say it was because they did gang up on you and gaslighted you. And you did probably say some hurtful things, and by the tone of this post you sound remorseful. (Towards your wife, not necessarily your son) \n\nBut definitely set boundaries, delegate some responsibilities (monetary 1/3 of a water bill maybe  which could range from $30-$70) that should be enough to teach responsibility", "Everyone here really could have communicated better:\n\nSon could have sent you and wife a text that he left his pizza on the counter and please don\u2019t take any.\n\nYou could have quickly texted or called your wife and son to ask whether you could have some of the pizza on the counter. \n\nUsually, in a household that shares food, it is best practice to ask before eating any of something you didn\u2019t buy or specifically requested that someone else buy.", "I mean, for the question you asked, no you are N T A. But that thing you slipped in at the end, where because you're the primary earner, you get to unilaterally decide household finances, yeah, not how marriage works. You and your wife are partners. I'm assuming you've had conversations in the past about finances. I'm assuming there is some reason your wife only works part time (she probably was the primary care giver for your son, I'm guessing?). Or maybe you've always just been a dictator in your own home, just making decisions by fiat because \"I'm the one who makes the money, so I get to make the rules.\"\n\nSo yeah, from this story, it sounds like your son has some growing up to do. It also sounds like you should be able to eat pizza your son buys, and it's fine if you and your wife decide together to kick him out. \n\nBut it also sounds like you think of yourself as a tiny dictator running your little home, and since you make the money, everyone (including your wife) has to bow to your wishes. So, ESH, but honestly, your behavior seems more concerning to me.", "ESH. Your son should be moving out on his own and learn how to manage his money. He should also be happy to share with you when you share with him freely. \n\nYour reaction was pretty explosive though Not that your wrong. But maybe stepping away to cool off then telling him all the reasons you think he should move out calmly. The way you did it just makes it seem like you just blew up over pizza.", "ESH.   \n\n\nNo one is acting like an adult in this mess.", "The stuff with the kid you are obviously NTA.
