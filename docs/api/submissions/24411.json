He usually eats with us every day and eats food that I pay for. \n\nI told him that it was on my counter in my house and that made it food for me. He has his own kitchen downstairs and that if he doesn't want me to eat his food he should keep it down there. He didn't agree and kept yelling. I told him that it was time for him to move out. Four years of living in my house rent free as an employed adult was enough and that it was time to go. \n\nHe shut up, took his pizza, and went downstairs. When his mom got home she was pissed off at me. He works hard for his money and when he buys himself a treat I shouldn't help myself to some of it. I've pretty much had it with her too.

He wants to be king of the castle and not contribute a thing, so boundaries definitely need to be set. If your wife wants to help him get a house, cool. Set a goal for a date and how much to save in that time. If he's nowhere close then that's all the evidence you need that he's not really trying and is just freeloading. Your wife might be a tough one to convince but having her pitch in should definitely show her that she's putting unreasonable expectations on you that she herself can't even, or wont, fulfill", "NTA - sometimes the person completely being taken advantage of has had enough - looks like you got to that point.", "I'd say NTA and this is something that's been brewing inside you for a long time. \n\nYou know that this might lead to a divorce, but considering the amount of resentment that radiates from your post, that might not be a bad thing at this point.\n\nEveryone in your family takes you for granted, and that's a very shitty feeling.", "Damn, this boy is you. His has at least 30k when he sells his sh't. Enough for rent for a while.", "NTA.  Your logic is sound; if it\u2019s on a community space, it\u2019s open for grabs.  That\u2019s the rule at my house.  If you want to keep it for yourself, say something/add a note/etc.  Your wife can buy him a new pizza if it\u2019s \u201cjust a pizza\u201d.", "NTA. Sounds like a major change is in order. No rent and buying toys is ridiculous. Charge him rent and put it into a down payment fund to gift back when he\u2019s ready to buy a house.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve been very generous. Two slices of pizza from a box in your kitchen\u2026any reasonable person would think it was to be shared.", "NTA. But seriously you need to talk to your wife about letting your son grow up.", "NTA-my 26 year old son lives at home, doesn't pay rent and if he brought home something that he paid for, he would absolutely offer it up to me because I PAY FOR EVERYTHING ELSE!", "In the big NTA. Your wife is coddling a grown man which is not doing him any favors. His quality of life would be better if he had his own home and could move on in his life but she is doing everything to keep him in her basement like a little kid. I know they can\u2019t see it because they are focused on pizza and money, but this isn\u2019t a dignified life for him and you wanting him to move out is not punishment, but a different kind of help and love.", "NTA, but if your son wants to stay he needs to prove he is saving because he has a lot of expensive toys. 4 years rent free is very generous. Your son & wife are jerks.", "NTA. I can see your wife being considerate of him, but he needs to grow up. At least, he should not act so entitled? And he seems like he can manage on his own, time for him to go.", "NTA First of all, how were you supposed to know he bought it? And if he's eating your food, he has no right to get mad. It sounds like it IS time for him to move out. If he hasn't saved for a house, then he can get an apartment while he saves. It's time for the free ride to end. He's a grown man and needs to act like one.", "NTA but separate your finances already. They ought to be putting in AT LEAST half towards mortgage/rent/utilities/food.", "Goodness me, imagine having this as a life. \n\nTike to put your foot down.", "NTA at 26 it's time to cut the umbilical cord and send your son on his merry selfish ways.", "\"He works hard for his money\"\n\nAnd you don't?  He is the one who wanted to nickel and dime about what he pays for.  He started the money conversation and you finished it.  NTA, OP.  He's 26 and it sounds like your wife is enabling him to regress into childhood.", "This is not a clear cut YTA/NTA but it sounds like there is a lot of boundaries that are not set. You all need to sit down and decide what to do as in you and your wife need to talk first about giving your son some bills and responsibilities. (W/o yelling or high tense emotions and blaming) Also sounds like you all need to live in a roommate situation not as a parents/son situation which is much different meaning no shared spaces, clear cut boundaries. You stay in your space I stay in mine. No food sharing. Your son is an AH for getting so defensive because there was no way for you to know that the food was out of bounds because it was in your kitchen. \n\nNot everything should lead to DIVORCE. Unless there are other marital problems. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m not saying immediate NTA is because you lost your cool at the end. But we can say it was because they did gang up on you and gaslighted you. And you did probably say some hurtful things, and by the tone of this post you sound remorseful. (Towards your wife, not necessarily your son) \n\nBut definitely set boundaries, delegate some responsibilities (monetary 1/3 of a water bill maybe  which could range from $30-$70) that should be enough to teach responsibility", "Everyone here really could have communicated better:\n\nSon could have sent you and wife a text that he left his pizza on the counter and please don\u2019t take any.\n\nYou could have quickly texted or called your wife and son to ask whether you could have some of the pizza on the counter. \n\nUsually, in a household that shares food, it is best practice to ask before eating any of something you didn\u2019t buy or specifically requested that someone else buy.", "I mean, for the question you asked, no you are N T A. But that thing you slipped in at the end, where because you're the primary earner, you get to unilaterally decide household finances, yeah, not how marriage works. You and your wife are partners. I'm assuming you've had conversations in the past about finances. I'm assuming there is some reason your wife only works part time (she probably was the primary care giver for your son, I'm guessing?). Or maybe you've always just been a dictator in your own home, just making decisions by fiat because \"I'm the one who makes the money, so I get to make the rules.\"\n\nSo yeah, from this story, it sounds like your son has some growing up to do. It also sounds like you should be able to eat pizza your son buys, and it's fine if you and your wife decide together to kick him out. \n\nBut it also sounds like you think of yourself as a tiny dictator running your little home, and since you make the money, everyone (including your wife) has to bow to your wishes. So, ESH, but honestly, your behavior seems more concerning to me.", "ESH. Your son should be moving out on his own and learn how to manage his money. He should also be happy to share with you when you share with him freely. \n\nYour reaction was pretty explosive though Not that your wrong. But maybe stepping away to cool off then telling him all the reasons you think he should move out calmly. The way you did it just makes it seem like you just blew up over pizza.", "ESH.   \n\n\nNo one is acting like an adult in this mess.", "The stuff with the kid you are obviously NTA. This last part of this is technically financial abuse. You don\u2019t get to just cut off support of your wife because she doesn\u2019t agree with you on something, be a fucking adult.", "ESH. \n\nI can see where you figured the pizza was fair game if that\u2019s \u201cyour\u201d kitchen and he also has one. \n\nThe escalation on both your parts was petty AF.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
