You all need to sit down and decide what to do as in you and your wife need to talk first about giving your son some bills and responsibilities. (W/o yelling or high tense emotions and blaming) Also sounds like you all need to live in a roommate situation not as a parents/son situation which is much different meaning no shared spaces, clear cut boundaries. You stay in your space I stay in mine. No food sharing. Your son is an AH for getting so defensive because there was no way for you to know that the food was out of bounds because it was in your kitchen. \n\nNot everything should lead to DIVORCE.

I'm assuming you've had conversations in the past about finances. I'm assuming there is some reason your wife only works part time (she probably was the primary care giver for your son, I'm guessing?). Or maybe you've always just been a dictator in your own home, just making decisions by fiat because \"I'm the one who makes the money, so I get to make the rules.\"\n\nSo yeah, from this story, it sounds like your son has some growing up to do. It also sounds like you should be able to eat pizza your son buys, and it's fine if you and your wife decide together to kick him out. \n\nBut it also sounds like you think of yourself as a tiny dictator running your little home, and since you make the money, everyone (including your wife) has to bow to your wishes. So, ESH, but honestly, your behavior seems more concerning to me.", "ESH. Your son should be moving out on his own and learn how to manage his money. He should also be happy to share with you when you share with him freely. \n\nYour reaction was pretty explosive though Not that your wrong.
