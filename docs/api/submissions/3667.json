How about \u201cWhat prompted dropping out? What is your plan? What are you thinking of doing instead? What career options have you considered? How will you support yourself?\u201d Just for starters. I get that not everyone is academic, and that many tradespeople make an excellent living, but a kid just deciding to drop out of high school has probably not thought things through. It\u2019s your job as a parent to at least try to make sure they become a fully functioning adult, not just stand on the sidelines.", "Am I the only one who wonders what may be going on with this 17 year old kid that he doesn't want to be in school? Is he having academic issues, or issues with other students or teachers? Has there been any push maybe for counseling for this kid? 17 is still a minor and parenting doesn't stop at 18. I feel like there's a lot more to this story than is being told here. This whole family sounds like it could benefit from counseling.", "Info: why didn\u2019t you tell him that your son dropped out? Why did he have to find out for himself?", "There\u2019s a lot of missing info here. \nWhy didn\u2019t you tell your husband? Did you ask your son what he wanted to do going forward? There seems to be a lack of communication in your family, like instead of talking about an issue everyone is just choosing to kick people out.", "YTA. Your son just up and quits school with no other plan than just sit around and you do...nothing? Don't tell his dad/your husband, don't say anything to your son, just nothing. Sounds like you're good with your son doing fuck all with his life, his dad isn't. You're failing absolutely everyone right now.", "Info- is Evan your sons father?", "YTA.  Why did you not tell him about your son dropping out of school?  His response is reasonable.  Why should your son just live off you and have no expectations?", "YTA-\n1. when he told you that he is dropping out, you didn't say anything, didn't ask the reasons or how can you support him.\n2. You hid it from your husband.\n3. When husband took a stand and tried to parent his child, you started arguing and kicked him out which gave your son confidence to keep doing whatever he likes without any consequences.", "The thing that jumped out at me was right at the end:\n\n>a majority of my family is on Team Evan\n\nThe fact that you've already divided the family in your mind between \"Team Evan\" and \"Team OP\" tells me you're entirely too focussed on the wrong aspects of this situation. Is anyone here on \"Team Jimmy\"?\n\nNot knowing what one wants to do after high school is normal. But refusing to finish high school because he, in your words, \"doesn't feel like attending anymore\" is *exactly* the kind of thing that is your responsibility as parents to address \u2014 because there could be any number of reasons he doesn't want to attend school anymore, and while some are valid they're also mostly all reasons for concern as a parent. There's absolutely more at the root of his desire to drop out in his senior year, even if he doesn't have the tools to realise or express it.\n\nNow maybe moving straight to kicking the kid out of the house (which by the way is not what actually happened, but I'll digress on that tangent) might have been an overreaction. Insisting that if he refuse to attend school he pay rent, requiring him to get a full time job, might have been a more productive solution that would have better made the point about the importance of finishing secondary school \u2014 \"I'm dropping out of high school just because\" is not an appealing attitude to most interviewers. Or maybe he needs to see a counsellor or a therapist to help him understand where and why this apathy is coming from, and how to overcome it.\n\nBut while it's true a discussion needed to be had, you lost the right to insist on that discussion when you lied to your husband and told him Jimmy had been suspended. Even if this were a minor blip you could set aside for a week and talk about later (it's not \u2014 this is a Level One parenting conversation you need to *make* time for), that's not what you did. You didn't just not tell your husband, you told him something else; not a lie of omission, but an active attempt to mislead him about his child.\n\nSo I'm gonna go with **YTA**. Evan isn't innocent either, but not only is kicking him out of the house just as much an overreaction as his kicking Jimmy out but at least he never lied to you about doing it.", "YTA. The longer you allow your sons behaviour and encourage him to live off you, the longer he will. Youre teaching him that he doesnt have to move a finger in his life because youll be there to carry him. Your husband was right, your son should learn to stand on his own feet, especially after he decided school isnt for him. He'll need a plan. How will he make a living? \"My parents got me\" is no answer to that question. \n\nI think you should talk things through with your husband and make sure youre on the same page. If you both differ in treatment of your son, he will quickly learn to play you both against each other to get what he wants.", "You are a double AH!! You not only didn't tell your husband he dropped out (based on your later comments- because you were for some baseless reason waiting *for the right time* ) but you some how magically found time to lie to him and say your son was just suspended. \n\nYou were covering for your son when you lied about his choice to leave school. You claim you didnt know what to say to Jimmy about the situation, but based on your comments and how you treated your husband (that you lied to) you probably just didn't feel like saying anything about it, because you liked the idea of your kid just hanging around at home all the time. \n\nLying to your husband and babying your deadbeat son, yup - YTA", "YTA for not talking with your husband about Jimmy dropping out.  His child as well as yours.  Then you BOTH could have figured out what should be done next.  As for the kicking out, Jimmy needs a plan other than sponging from his parents.  Your husband reacted in emotion and anger that he might now regret.  Maybe.  But you leaving him in the dark like that was not nice.", "why didn\u2019t you tell **your husband** that your kid dropped out of school? and why didn\u2019t you encourage him to get a job instead of staying home day?\n\nsee, that\u2019s why I can\u2019t say E S H for everyone, bc while Evan sucks for kicking his son out, **you** purposely withheld information from him about his own son so he was just reacting. \n\nYTA and your son too. if he\u2019s old enough to drop out, he\u2019s old enough to handle the consequences of that decision and also old enough to support himself.", "Definitely an AH. How do you not handle this when it happens? Can't you see your kid is going through something? You didn't even try to help him. Even now your more worried about your mom's reaction or your husband's rather than what you're son is going through. You also let your husband make a decision over your minor son without discussing with you, so ya you're the one that's in the wrong.", "INFO: is Evan Jimmy's father?", "YTA. You did not know what to do with your situation although you could have told your husband\n\nYour husband gave your son the choice school or kicked out . he chose kicked out. Its time for him to stand on his own feet. Time for him to learn his actions have consequences. If he does not want to go to school he wil have to provide from himself now and stop living of you and your husband.\n\nI am on team Evan all the way, perhaps your son cleans himself up / goes back to school  now ( he will soon find out you need money to live, you need to work for money and the better the schooling the more change on a decent amount of money for your work, plenty of stories here about kids staying and leeching of parents for years doing nothing", "YTA, your child needs serius tought love.", "YTA - it\u2019s your job to be patient, caring and persistent enough to get to the bottom of what\u2019s going on with your son and work together with him to find a solution to whatever is wrong.", "YTA\n\nHave fun being divorced with your kid.", "ESH\n\nHow exactly does kicking everyone out resolve this problem? Perhaps some communication might help... \n\nDid you actually lie about why Jimmy wasn\u2019t going to school? There\u2019s a big difference between suspended & dropped out (& never going back)\n\nedit", "ESH. You & your husband should try talking to each other every now and then. You suck for not telling your husband immediately about your kid quitting school a/o being suspended. Your husband sucks for making a unilateral decision to kick Jimmy out & not telling you first. You also suck for kicking your husband out of a house he is no doubt a co-owner of. That\u2019s no way to solve your problems. Whatever is going on with Jimmy, he should finish high school & get a job. If my kid told me he was quitting high school & didn\u2019t even want a GED, I would have plenty to say.", "YTA\n\nYou straight up lied to your husband. Told him Jimmy was suspended instead of dropped out. It doesn\u2019t matter his job or always being on call, that\u2019s information that both of you should have. Also Evan didn\u2019t kick Jimmy out. He gave him 2 options and Jimmy decided to leave instead of going back to school. \n\nThis is not absolving Evan at all but you did not give him all of the information. Did you try and find out what\u2019s going with Jimmy? Is there something happening at school? Is he being bullied? Is he being lead astray by friends/girlfriend? Is he just planning on living off of you 2 forever? Does he have some mental health issues going on? There\u2019s a laundry list of possibilities here. You didn\u2019t know what to say besides lying to Evan. Then you kick Evan out for the ultimatum he gave even though Jimmy made the decision to leave. \n\nYes, Jimmy is 17 and will make poor decisions. I made plenty at that age too. However, you and Evan should be a team and be discussing this with Jimmy and trying to help navigate him. You can\u2019t force him, but you need to parent him. It\u2019s difficult for Evan to be on your side when you\u2019re lying about what\u2019s going on. Couples, family, and individual therapy for all would be a good start. Find out what\u2019s going on with Jimmy or at least make the effort. Stop lying to Evan as well.", "Gracious, what\u2019s wrong with these comments?! Of course YTA and so is your husband. When your child comes to you and tells you they\u2019re dropping out, you don\u2019t get to just not say anything! This isn\u2019t a normal reaction from a teenager. Is he ok? Has something happened? What reasons are leading him to make this choice? It\u2019s your job as a parent to ask these questions and get to the bottom of the issue. You then lie to your husband for no apparent reason. And the fact that he kicked out a minor is the worst of all of this. I would call CPS on you if I knew where you lived!", "ESH. You're not providing your son with any sort of life lessons or help, your husband is being an ass with his hard love stance without taking a moment to find out what's going on with his son, and your son for not communicating with either of you. Y'all need help.", "ESH, Evan shouldn\u2019t have kicked out a 17 year old (which is illegal, and also this kid clearly needs help and support, not to be kicked out). Your son needs to figure out what he wants to do, but again, kicking him out is only going to make that harder. And you for being unable to support your kid when he\u2019s clearly going through something and lying to your husband about your son.\n\nAlso I\u2019m going to say I\u2019m genuinely concerned about the lack of empathy for this kid in the comment section. What Evan did was illegal and morally wrong, this 17 year old clearly needs help and guidance, I\u2019m not sure why so many people are so hostile towards him and thinking he \u201cdeserves\u201d to be kicked out.", "Kids these days dont get the tough love treatment and it shows. Yta. Coddling this lil punk wont do anyone any good.", "Everyone is an AH\n\nYou for lying\n\nYour husband for kicking out your son, who, being a minor, is both of your legal responsibilities.   You could be in trouble legally for kicking out your son", "YTA. You really can't kick your spouse out of your house. Evan also didn't kick his son out; he gave him an ultimatum and Jimmy chose to leave. Anyone who thinks they can just chill at their parents house after dropping out should face a harsh reality sooner than later, especially if it's possible to fix the mistake.", "YTA", "Info: What do you do does your husband pay for everything in your house or do you contribute. Is your name on the house or just his. It's understandable for your husband to not want to support someone financially who has no plan for life and will likely never work more than a minimum wage job. You can't even be a manager at a fast food place without a GED. Also what right did you have to hide the fact your son dropped out from your spouse and even like to his face about it and then kick him out of his own house for reacting. Maybe if you had sat down and talked with him and your son like adults the situation would have been different but instead you and your son chose to lie and be deceitful. The minute your son told you he was dropping out you should have told him to get a job and you should have told your husband.", "Yta", "NTA, they didn't even question to see if your son is going through anything and at the age of 17. There are other alternatives that don't require the traditional education system or there is a problem within the home that has pushed jimmy to a limit that you weren't aware of. However, keeping this a secret from your husband was a mistake, as a family, you should have discussed this and asked for a meeting with your son's school/leadership team.", "NTA. Bordering on slight E S H.\n\nThis should have been a joint decision.  Is Evan even Jimmy's father? I get he's your husband but whether or not he's Jimmy's dad is very unclear.  \n\nLet me be clear that I think Evan's position would be pretty fair if Jimmy were 18.  The fact that Jimmy is only 17 makes me raise an eyebrow though, because where I come from, that makes him still a minor.  I do think you and Evan should push him to get a GED, or take away privileges Jimmy has, such as if you pay for his phone plan, or removing his electronics until he agrees to get the GED.  It will hold him back in life by not having it, and that should be made clear to Jimmy. I also think Evan is right that Jimmy should be trying to finish school, but a GED at the very least should be the set expectation for your son.  \n\nYou need to sit Jimmy down and have a reality based discussion with him about these matters. I don't believe either Evan or Jimmy should be kicked out, I think there should be some healthy family discussion though, and clear boundaries drawn for Jimmy about what is expected of him by his parent(s).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he doesn't seem to care about that . . . again, could he be suffering depression that is keeping him from SEEING a future for himself? Was he being bullied or struggling socially and doesn't want to physically BE at school? These are things you need to sit down and talk to him about. You also need to help him set some boundaries and goals so he understands that he is not actually the centre of his own universe, and that he has responsibilities, even to himself. \n\nWithout throwing him out, you can say to him, \"You are ALWAYS welcome in our home, but you need to be doing SOMETHING.

Many jobs or training programs that would have taken a high school dropout without a GED a couple of decades ago now require at least a GED.

Your husband shouldn't have necessarily kicked him out, but I would like to know how the conversation went between the two of them. \n\nYour son needs therapy. He's likely depressed or may be on drugs. Kicking him out without at least TRYING to help him won't resolve anything. Neither will coddling him, which is what you've been doing.

What is wrong with you?", "As a father to both a 17 y/o son (soon to be 18) and 15 y/o son (soon to be 16) I am saying YTA. \n\nMy reasoning is simple - you opted to co-sign your son's bad decisions by not telling your husband of what was transpiring. For all the bleeding hearts who say that the husband is wrong in this scenario - I definitely don't agree. Your job as a parent is to teach your kids, love them, support them, guide them. The husband has loved & supported Jimmy (evidenced by his being interested in Jimmy's future endeavors) and once the truth came out - the husband is still invested, and is now guiding Jimmy by teaching Jimmy the very hard lesson about his decisions and the consequences that come with those decisions. \n\nJimmy made no plan for what to do after he dropped out of school. He made no effort to discuss things with the husband and instead felt entitled enough to continue to live at home and not contribute - through working or attending school. To make matters worse OP co-signed on this plan and together Jimmy and her both schemed to hide Jimmy's dropping out from the husband, even after inquiries were made by the husband and arguments began taking place. \n\nJimmy had a bunch of choices to make, all of which were either going to be right or wrong. Let's see how Jimmy did:\n\nJimmy could choose to:\n\n1. Go to school -or- Stop attending/drop out. Jimmy chose: Drop out (**Wrong**)\n2. Get a GED -or- Don't. Jimmy chose: Don't (**Wrong**)\n3. Get a future plan together -or- Make no plan. Jimmy chose: Make no plan (**Wrong**)\n4. Tell OP's husband/his dad about dropping out -or- Don't. Jimmy chose: Don't (**Wrong**)\n5. Go back to school -or- Get kicked out. Jimmy chose: Kicked Out (**Wrong**)\n\nSounds to me like OP just wanted to be the good guy and not actually parent. Either because Jimmy is her \"little buddy\" or because she doesn't have the fortitude to actually dig into her son and correct his errored ways. She didn't speak up when Jimmy approached her with this idea of dropping out. She didn't speak up when the husband was questioning Jimmy. She didn't speak up when arguments started happening between Jimmy and the husband, She just stayed quiet. Feigned ignorance. But yet she wants to argue with the husband over HIS decision to actually parent?!? GTHFOH!\n\nSo, if I was that husband, faced with this same scenario - I would be making the same exact decision for this 17 year old. It doesn't sound like Jimmy is going to be living under a bridge and digging through dumpsters to find scraps of Little Ceasar's pizza - especially if his gf is picking up his stuff from OP's house. \n\nNo, more than likely Jimmy will be couch surfing with his buddies, smoking weed, and wasting their food and resources - - or he will resort to peddling some sort of sob story about how \"nobody loves me\" to his gf's parents in the hopes that he can garner their sympathy and crash with them - - with no job, no finality to his education, no prospects....just a mass of cells taking up space, eating their food, wasting their electricity and resources and more than likely - doing his best to get the gf knocked up in his \"down time\" - - because hey if she's prego - - then there's welfare money!\n\nGreat job at parenting OP.

Why has your son decided to quit school? And what is his plan if he\u2019s not pursuing a GED? There are certainly many careers that don\u2019t require years of higher education, but most trade schools require a GED so his future options will be severely limited by that choice.
