I\u2019ve had a tough few years and wanted a fresh start. I don\u2019t plan on returning home for at least a year.\n\nI only told my parents, friends and my moms family about the move. I\u2019m not on good terms with my dads side due to an incident earlier this year where a family member was disrespectful and threatening to me and my mom. Since then they\u2019ve sided with the perpetrator and treated us as if we\u2019re the problem. I knew if I told them it would be met by negativity, especially from my grandma who thinks women can\u2019t do anything alone. I told my parents I didn\u2019t want them to know until after I left and they agreed.\n\nMy birthday was on Thursday. My grandma text for the first time in a few months to say she has a card for me and will drop it off. I told her thanks but that won\u2019t be necessary as I\u2019m not home. She asked when will she see me and I told her I\u2019m in Australia. She was furious. She called my dad saying how could he let me do this and not tell her, she didn\u2019t get to say bye to her only granddaughter and I\u2019m foolish for moving so far away by myself. \nShe left me a voicemail saying I broke her heart and how will the rest of my family feel when they find out. She tried to guilt trip me saying I may not see her again if she falls ill while I\u2019m away. I think this is unfair as shes not that old and has no health issues. Am I supposed to put my life on hold in case she gets sick? \n\nI didn\u2019t mean to upset her but she has 4 other grandkids who see her often. I get she wanted to say bye, but my assumptions about her negativity were correct. Im also mad at her and feel she doesn\u2019t respect me or my mom. She told my aunt, who accused me of \u2018punishing them\u2019 for another family members actions. She\u2019s mad I won\u2019t be home for Christmas as her kids won\u2019t see their favorite cousin (which is hilarious as they haven\u2019t seen me in months) and she doesn\u2019t know what to tell them. My dad regrets not telling them and says I should apologize. He said this could tear the family apart, but in my eyes that already happened through their previous actions. My mom is on my side and says I don\u2019t owe them anything.\n\nAITA for not saying goodbye or visiting my family before I left?", "created_utc": 1667153926, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhlrfh/aita_for_moving_to_australia_without_telling_my/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nothing you've said in your post seems to point to them asking why you left without telling them, or even if you're ok.

As someone who hates his dad's side of the family with a cold, hard, undying passion - I cut my grandparents out of my life completely and straight up told my grandmother that when she dies, I'll dance on her grave.

If your family is that fragile, the problem stems from something way bigger than your move.\nAre you sure the aunt talking about your cousins missing you wasn't just a silly way to express how much you are loved?\nIDK grama sounds a bit controlling and like a perpetual victim.", "NTA.

Go ahead and explore the world and find a life with happiness and peace that YOU deserve", "NTA - They didn't cared where or how you were until they learned you could live your life without them. \n\nQuite laughable at best and understandably upsetting the way they try to guilt trip you, and in such ridiculous way of what if something terrible happened. You aren't kept hostage in a foreign country and could come back at any time, also even living next door you could choose not to see them.
