Love that you stood up for yourself.", "OK, so perhaps you were a tad out of line, but I love you anyway.\n\nConstantly pushing a young woman to get married does nothing but make her very unhappy if she longs to be married, or even more anxious about the very idea of marriage if it's something that already doesn't appeal to her, or downright furious if she's already sure that marriage isn't for her.\n\nThere is no possible good outcome.  \n\nWhat you said to your grandmother was extremely harsh, but the ingratitude of someone with the temerity to complain about the appearance of the food you're providing for her combined with the suggestion that even if you want to get married, forget it, because you don't serve pretty enough food, was enough to push anyone over the edge.\n\nDon't even think about marriage.  You don't have to make any decisions about it.  You don't have to live your life as if it's supposed to lead there.  And you don't have to listen to one more word about how you need to get married.  I suspect your grandmother got that message loud and clear.\n\nNTA", "Wild. My grandma told me men are liabilities and she\u2019s glad times changed so I can just take care of myself. My other grandma had her hubby wrapped around her finger since 13 so she had a good life but never pushed it on me. \n\nAdopt a new grandma. There\u2019s plenty hanging out at homes with kids who barely visit. You can get a new granny and do volunteer work.", "NTA. Maybe grandma is a little jealous of your freedom. She did not have near the choices women have today. (But, we\u2019re not babies and we haven\u2019t come a long way)", "NTA -  you're 24, far too young to get married in this day and age.  You need to live a little before settling down, getting married and having kids.  I'm in my mid 40's and still don't want to get married and have kids and no-one in my family is going on about, in fact, they often lament that its not fair that I'm single and can do what I want and I should be miserable like the rest of them.", "Sometimes people need to hear the harsh truth\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "as an asian,speaking to your elders like that is considered out of line...so is criticizing you for not getting married.\n\nNTA because i personally do not believe it's anyone's business to tell you when you should or shouldn't get married.", "YTA for having no self control around an old person. You said the most hurtful thing you could imagine to a woman who couldn't possibly have imaged having the choices you do. Wtf?", "I mean. Based on this post, the comments, how you express yourself as a whole. You sound swell. I think you need an attitude check to start. NTA but really gotta know grandma only wants best for you, not trying to put you down. Take it for what you will.", "NTA. My sister ended up telling our religious grandparents that she was a lesbian to shut them up.  Sometimes you have to say what needs to be said to give yourself some peace.", "You are not an AH.  I respect you for standing up for yourself.  kt", "NTA, but people don't like earing painful truths. I don't know if going this far was necessary...she's old, stuck in a old way of thinking were the values of women were measure through marriage, she were probably already deeply hurt by her life. But I do understand why you did it.", "As much as my mom pisses me off, I so appreciate the fact that she never hounded me to get married and have children. She shut down anyone who tried to guilt trip me. She always said she would honor our decision regarding this. \nNTA.", "I'm proud of you \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd", "Plus my grand'mere loved and respected her husband. But, she didn't pine for him when he was gone and she never wanted to remarry. Her husband was a lot older than she was and the first independence of her long life did not kick in until he passed away.", "So very well said and very eloquent.", "This sparks joy", "This is the way.", "\u201cIf you\u2019re not grateful for the food, then you don\u2019t get to eat it\u201d while taking the plate back", "Funny you say that, because my mom thought I was secretly gay for the longest as well until I cleared up that I wasn\u2019t", "My straight up answer when I\u2019m asked when I\u2019m getting married and having kids is \u201cI\u2019m unapologeticly single because I value my freedom and independence\u201d It usually leads to people saying I\u2019ll die miserable and alone but I\u2019m happier than most of my married friends and get to travel the world because I\u2019m not paying for a spouse and kids.", "My genuine answer to this is \"no, I'm not gay, but I am asexual and aromantic.\"", "You and OP need to make a fake-partner holiday pact!  Like a Hallmark movie hahahaha", "I don\u2019t celebrate my dad\u2019s death but I don\u2019t get sad about it.", "May your husband rest easy", "Are we all just gonna skip over the whole \u201cserve your husband food\u201d?! NTA", "This was the latest in a long line of passive aggressive comments about OP's relationship status, after OP told her the subject was not to be brought up. Grandma learned that if you pick at someone's flaws unasked for too often your own will be exposed.", "I mean, OP is 24 and if grandma was married and having kids before her age, then she could easily be in her 60s. The divorce laws in the 1980s in many places weren\u2019t perfect but we shouldn\u2019t assume grandma was having kids in the fifties automatically. Sadly the more likely issue was religion and being told to forgive the SOB who cheated because God. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think OP started by shutting grandma out. Grandma keeps ignoring OP\u2019s boundaries of not to talk about something and pushing her viewpoint. Sadly, OP has had terrible examples of relationships and it is easy to see why she wouldn\u2019t care to rush into one. OP may or may not decide differently in time but her grandmother continuously pushing meant she will be less likely to want to try. When grandma doesn\u2019t listen and continually prods, OP is not gonna listen either. \n\nIt seems like grandma doesn\u2019t wanna talk so much as criticize. Why should Op listen to such things? It isn\u2019t required she be in a relationship and even if she did, she doesn\u2019t have to do things grandma\u2019s way. Maybe if grandma listened to OP\u2019s boundaries before she felt like she needed to snap to be heard, then this little issue wouldn\u2019t have occurred. I mean she complained the food wasn\u2019t pretty enough. OP isn\u2019t a chef in a high end restaurant.", "The difference is that OP didn't insist her way was the only way. Even old people can recognize change. In general, people want a better life for their children and grandchildren than the one they had. In this case, Grandma wants everyone to suffer as she suffered. That makes her the AH.", "I think that agree with you. Grandma was wrong, but OP could have put a positive spin on her stance that even grandma can get behind. Instead of being rude to grandma say, \"Hey grandma, I'm already living my best life. I'm not tied down with responsibilities to a family. I'm also having a blast being single. I'm going to enjoy this as long as it lasts. Didn't you enjoy your downtime away from the responsibilities of being a wife and mother? Everyone deserves a break right? You can now enjoy the freedom that I have now. It's can't be that bad right?\" Again, being positive will get grandma to chill more so than just being mean to her.", "I was leaning strongly towards NTA, but you make some great points. Well stated.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t say that to grandma\u201c\n\nWHY??? What makes them so special, cause they are old? There are assholes in this world that grow to get old!!!!", "The whole \"respect your elders\" mindset is such crap. The grandma was talking about her personal life and insulting her on top of that. That's not being a fem incel, that was matching someone's energy. Maybe grandma shouldn't be a female misogynist if she didn't want her feelings hurt.", "Don\u2019t dish it out if you can\u2019t take it", "Lol they don't deserve respect if they can't respect others.", "Was kinda shocked to see so many NTAs, old people can get annoying but no need to go full attack mode.", "Hey, real quick. What do you think is \u201cback then\u201d here?", "How do you know that. The Grandma could be in her early 60\u2019s. And my exMIZl has been on deaths door for 8 years and gets meaner every year.", "You don\u2019t know my dynamic with my grandmother, you only know of this instance. You don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll miss her when she\u2019s gone. Know your place as a stranger", "Why would anyone regret not taking onboard that sexist drivel?", "She\u2019s in her mid 70s", "Why not take it a step further and not prepare food for her? \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t prepare food for grandma when she won\u2019t treat me with respect. I would rather go scrub the toilets instead\u201d", "Shit my family and friends still think I am lol. I refused to be pressured into dating to prove otherwise. \n\nAs for dating. I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s not a problem with women or men. Just people. People just suck and I don\u2019t want to put up with them.", "I let my mom believe that for years since it cut out most of those hints and questions about marriage and children.\n\nWhen I got pregnant and she was shocked, I told her that I never bothered to correct her misassumptions since it would just lead to more harassment.", "Why do you think they are skipping over it?!", "\"Your cooking is wack\" doesnt constitute bringing up a bunch of traumatic memories if we're doing this \"eye for eye\" logic", "Real \"this is why you had a miscarriage\" energy", "Seriously. OP is only 24. Grandma may only be in her 60s or 70s.", "Everything you say is correct.  But the same can be said about every comment made here. But I stand by my comment. Too many people on this site are more concerned with being right. Sometimes you just have to suck it up to keep family harmony. And then there are those that post here for vindication on their actions. You are one of those. If not why argue with a stranger that doesn\u2019t agree with your position?", "As someone in his fifties, with no kids, I wish I had had kids.", "That.. is not a reason grandmas sexist shit something anyone who has any self respect would regret not taking onboard", "What I\u2019m gods name does that have to do with an old lady who doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s 2023 and women in sane places of the world don\u2019t need a man.  \n\nAre you not married? Is that why you\u2019re bitter?  Because we can choose now and some men just don\u2019t get chosen.", "Grandma knows that time flies by so fast. And even though it doesn\u2019t sound like things worked out for her, she knows that the longer you leave things, the less chance they have of working out.", "The old woman realises that the year doesn\u2019t matter.  Things don\u2019t change that much.  Sadly, you will only realise that she was right after it is too late to do anything about it.", "I've been trying to ask them  the same thing but then I took a peak at their post history and found these gems\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That\u2019s because we don\u2019t care about anyone in the middle east and we\u2019re tired of pretending that we do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Coy? I made it very clear. I don\u2019t care about muslims or jews.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Annoying as fuck. I don\u2019t bother washing my hands because I can\u2019t be arsed putting up with the hassle.\n\nI'm pretty sure they are just an unpleasant person", "Sorry did you even read what grandma actually said?\n\n>Is this how you will serve your husband food when you get married?\n\nGrandma didn't say shit about time going fast or not leaving things. She said OP should be thinking about serving her future husband food. Sexist bullshit.", "I read it.  The grandma is a realist.  She knows that regardless of what people want from a marriage we fall in to certain tropes like the wife cooking and the husband making sure the car is working correctly.  Only people who haven\u2019t gone through the process would be so naive to think that they knew more about life.", "I see why you don't have the partner and kids you wanted"]}
