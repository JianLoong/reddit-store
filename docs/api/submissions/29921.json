Love that you stood up for yourself.", "OK, so perhaps you were a tad out of line, but I love you anyway.\n\nConstantly pushing a young woman to get married does nothing but make her very unhappy if she longs to be married, or even more anxious about the very idea of marriage if it's something that already doesn't appeal to her, or downright furious if she's already sure that marriage isn't for her.\n\nThere is no possible good outcome.  \n\nWhat you said to your grandmother was extremely harsh, but the ingratitude of someone with the temerity to complain about the appearance of the food you're providing for her combined with the suggestion that even if you want to get married, forget it, because you don't serve pretty enough food, was enough to push anyone over the edge.\n\nDon't even think about marriage.  You don't have to make any decisions about it.  You don't have to live your life as if it's supposed to lead there.  And you don't have to listen to one more word about how you need to get married.  I suspect your grandmother got that message loud and clear.\n\nNTA", "Wild. My grandma told me men are liabilities and she\u2019s glad times changed so I can just take care of myself.

The divorce laws in the 1980s in many places weren\u2019t perfect but we shouldn\u2019t assume grandma was having kids in the fifties automatically. Sadly the more likely issue was religion and being told to forgive the SOB who cheated because God. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think OP started by shutting grandma out. Grandma keeps ignoring OP\u2019s boundaries of not to talk about something and pushing her viewpoint. Sadly, OP has had terrible examples of relationships and it is easy to see why she wouldn\u2019t care to rush into one. OP may or may not decide differently in time but her grandmother continuously pushing meant she will be less likely to want to try. When grandma doesn\u2019t listen and continually prods, OP is not gonna listen either. \n\nIt seems like grandma doesn\u2019t wanna talk so much as criticize. Why should Op listen to such things? It isn\u2019t required she be in a relationship and even if she did, she doesn\u2019t have to do things grandma\u2019s way. Maybe if grandma listened to OP\u2019s boundaries before she felt like she needed to snap to be heard, then this little issue wouldn\u2019t have occurred. I mean she complained the food wasn\u2019t pretty enough. OP isn\u2019t a chef in a high end restaurant.", "The difference is that OP didn't insist her way was the only way. Even old people can recognize change. In general, people want a better life for their children and grandchildren than the one they had. In this case, Grandma wants everyone to suffer as she suffered. That makes her the AH.", "I think that agree with you. Grandma was wrong, but OP could have put a positive spin on her stance that even grandma can get behind.

I'm going to enjoy this as long as it lasts. Didn't you enjoy your downtime away from the responsibilities of being a wife and mother? Everyone deserves a break right?

But find a more mature way of handling disagreements with life choices, even if your grandma hasn't.", "ESH..yes she should have kept her comments about marriage to herself, but you need to remember that likely when she married women couldn\u2019t have their own checking accounts, hold jobs, drive, or have birth control. She had to do what was best back then not by today\u2019s standards. I feel like you overreacted and escalated it.", "Reddit gets a lot of posts like yours, where the OP is spoken to in a demeaning manner, and either replies in kind, or escalates.  Most reader replies are along the lines of \"good for you, they deserved it.\"  Some might say that honoring family elders is a moral imperative, but my view is that elders give up the privilege of talking to you like a child well before you reach 24.\n\nRarely do I read a \"turn the other cheek\" reply (that's Jesus, I think) or \"a soft answer turns away wrath\" (Proverbs, maybe).  Biblical or not, I consider this a utilitarian view in moral clothing, in which momentary satisfaction is weighed against future reverberations, just as you report.  The \"utility\" is in maintaining a good working relationship with family, friends and neighbors - which was a LOT more vital in Biblical times than in today's impersonal economy and digital society. \n\nI can't help with that soft option, cuz I have no idea what you have to lose beyond Grandma's angry silence, or your parents' reproach, nor do I know how important, emotionally or materially, it is for you to maintain their goodwill.\n\nSo I will say only that Family Feud is usually a long game, and to do well at it, you need to be a master strategist with ice water in your veins, looking at least one or two moves ahead, and keeping your priorities straight.  Had you done so, you MIGHT have won Mom and Dad to your side.\n\nI'd also like you to imagine your parents' response to your final words to Grandma.
