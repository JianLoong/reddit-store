He truly is the love of my life and I can\u2019t wait to marry him. \n\nEver since I was a teenager, I knew I wanted a small bridal party, aka just my two sisters as my matron of honor and bridesmaid. But I also knew I wanted my close friends to be apart of my day too. That\u2019s why I\u2019m having a \u201cblue crew\u201d. Basically, my close friends are going to be my \u201csomething blue\u201d so that way they can be a memorable/important part of the day. They\u2019re also going to be invited to all of the pre-wedding festivities (engagement party, bridal shower, bachelorette party, rehearsal dinner, etc). I\u2019ve already asked my three best girlfriends with a small gift box that included the shade of blue I would like for them to wear, a beer koozie that\u2019s says \u201cblue crew\u201d, a blue silk robe to get ready in, and a handwritten note just telling them how much I love them and how much their friendship means to me.\n\nOver the weekend, I asked the final two people, my best male friends (let\u2019s call them B and G), to also be in the blue crew. Their boxes included basically the same things except no robe and I gifted them both ties and suspenders to wear on the day of my wedding. They both happily accepted and that\u2019s when B\u2019s wife (let\u2019s call her \u2018J\u2019) asked where her gift box was.\n\nFor context, I\u2019ve been friends with B for nearly 5 years and he started dating J a year into our friendship. J and I were really close for the first two years of their relationship but have since had a falling out. Basically, she made it clear to me that she wasn\u2019t interested in being \u201cas close\u201d and that I should stop \u201cforcing similarities\u201d between us. All of that took me by surprise but I have since accepted it and moved on. I\u2019m still polite in group settings but we don\u2019t hang out 1x1 like we had done in the past. I was also apart of their wedding as a groomsman.\n\nI told her that I didn\u2019t have one for her and she then said \u201cokay, well what shade of blue should I get my dress in?\u201d\n\nI was taken aback by her question and told her that she doesn\u2019t have to wear blue to the wedding because she wasn\u2019t included in the blue crew. She just let out an awkward \u2018oh\u2019 before going quiet. I realized that my delivery was probably a little harsher than necessary and told her that she\u2019s still invited to the pre-wedding parties and the wedding itself but she just doesn\u2019t have to wear blue. She shrugged it off in the moment but things were obviously still tense and they left shortly after. \n\nI\u2019ve since received texts from both J and B that I\u2019m being an asshole for only asking B and not including J since they\u2019re married and I was in their wedding. Both G and my fianc\u00e9 say that I didn\u2019t do anything wrong and I have the right to include or not include anyone I want since it\u2019s my wedding. But as much as I want to believe them, I can\u2019t help but wonder if I should just include her to avoid any future drama.\n\nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1697964000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dos2i/aita_for_not_including_my_friends_wife_in_my/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they push I would revolve the invitation to be in the party since it's a problem.", "NTA  \n\n\nI mean, she's the one that closed off your earlier friendship...and now she's acting all surprised and hurt?", "NTA - why would you include her? Did they include each partner in their wedding parties? Why should you be worrying about making unreasonable people \u2018more comfortable\u2019 in detriment to your comfort on your wedding day? \n\nThey are entitled and if they can\u2019t respect your wedding wishes, why do they think you should respect theirs for YOUR wedding?!\n\nI\u2019d spend more time wondering where they got the audacity and less time on your misplaced guilt.", "NTA\u2026turn it back around on J.   \u201cB and J, I\u2019m confused.  Three years ago, J came to me and said that she was not interested in being close to me  and I should stop forcing similarities on her.  Why is it then all of a sudden so important for me to consider J as part of my blue crew?  I\u2019m sorry, but that ship has sailed per J\u2019s wishes.\u201d", "NTA. You can\u2019t essentially tell someone to fuck off and that you don\u2019t want them to \u201cforce similarities\u201d to hang out anymore and then still expect to be part of what\u2019s essentially their bridal party, for lack of a better word. \n\nLike if she doesn\u2019t like being forced to hang out with you then fine, now she\u2019s not forced to on your wedding day.

I\u2019d understand why/how you were singling these people out if we were talking about your wedding party but you specifically say it\u2019s not that.  So it feels a little mean girls to create a way to show who are the people you like the best at events that presumably a wide range of friends will be attending.", "NTA. J already let you know that you're not friends and shouldn't assume that she's part of your blue crew because you were in her wedding on her husband's side.", "NTA that was tacky of her to ask where her gift box was.

I would respond to the message and tell J that\n\n B told you point blank \u201cshe wasn\u2019t interested in being close or doing things with you\u201d. She has not done anything with you in any way for years and has made sure she is at best just an acquaintance. She solely made theses decisions and can\u2019t now expect to be included and have all the perks when she made sure I know she doesn\u2019t see me as a friend. So it is fair that only J was invited as no bride or groom would ever want anyone but close friends in their bridal party. Honestly you have no idea why someone who clearly doesn\u2019t like you thinks they should be or is upset at not being asked. You are just honouring the boundaries B told you to respect and she told you to stop trying to do things with her and include her long ago. This whole thing has confused you as she\u2019s proven in all the time since then in her actions that it was what she wanted. You are not trying to upset anyone and are honestly just bewildered that suddenly B thinks she should be important in your life for this one day.", "Out of curiosity, why? It is not (and, as far as I'm aware, never has been) a thing where being a bridesmaids/something similar automatically includes a full couple. She's invited to the wedding, and her lack of closeness to the bride is by her own design.\n\nShe was weird to ask about it in the first place. Pushing with each no is what got her the accidentally harsh answer in the first place.\n\nI think OPs only real issue is calling them something outside of \"bridesmaids/brides people\" which MIGHT have lead this woman to believe it was something more casual than it is."]}
