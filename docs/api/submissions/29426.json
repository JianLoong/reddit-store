He truly is the love of my life and I can\u2019t wait to marry him. \n\nEver since I was a teenager, I knew I wanted a small bridal party, aka just my two sisters as my matron of honor and bridesmaid. But I also knew I wanted my close friends to be apart of my day too. That\u2019s why I\u2019m having a \u201cblue crew\u201d. Basically, my close friends are going to be my \u201csomething blue\u201d so that way they can be a memorable/important part of the day. They\u2019re also going to be invited to all of the pre-wedding festivities (engagement party, bridal shower, bachelorette party, rehearsal dinner, etc). I\u2019ve already asked my three best girlfriends with a small gift box that included the shade of blue I would like for them to wear, a beer koozie that\u2019s says \u201cblue crew\u201d, a blue silk robe to get ready in, and a handwritten note just telling them how much I love them and how much their friendship means to me.\n\nOver the weekend, I asked the final two people, my best male friends (let\u2019s call them B and G), to also be in the blue crew. Their boxes included basically the same things except no robe and I gifted them both ties and suspenders to wear on the day of my wedding. They both happily accepted and that\u2019s when B\u2019s wife (let\u2019s call her \u2018J\u2019) asked where her gift box was.\n\nFor context, I\u2019ve been friends with B for nearly 5 years and he started dating J a year into our friendship. J and I were really close for the first two years of their relationship but have since had a falling out. Basically, she made it clear to me that she wasn\u2019t interested in being \u201cas close\u201d and that I should stop \u201cforcing similarities\u201d between us. All of that took me by surprise but I have since accepted it and moved on. I\u2019m still polite in group settings but we don\u2019t hang out 1x1 like we had done in the past. I was also apart of their wedding as a groomsman.\n\nI told her that I didn\u2019t have one for her and she then said \u201cokay, well what shade of blue should I get my dress in?\u201d\n\nI was taken aback by her question and told her that she doesn\u2019t have to wear blue to the wedding because she wasn\u2019t included in the blue crew. She just let out an awkward \u2018oh\u2019 before going quiet. I realized that my delivery was probably a little harsher than necessary and told her that she\u2019s still invited to the pre-wedding parties and the wedding itself but she just doesn\u2019t have to wear blue. She shrugged it off in the moment but things were obviously still tense and they left shortly after. \n\nI\u2019ve since received texts from both J and B that I\u2019m being an asshole for only asking B and not including J since they\u2019re married and I was in their wedding. Both G and my fianc\u00e9 say that I didn\u2019t do anything wrong and I have the right to include or not include anyone I want since it\u2019s my wedding. But as much as I want to believe them, I can\u2019t help but wonder if I should just include her to avoid any future drama.\n\nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1697964000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dos2i/aita_for_not_including_my_friends_wife_in_my/", "score": 207, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
