Ooooh, she might get upset. Yea, so what.  \n\nNTA \n\nedit to add that some places are surprisingly nit-picky about the disposal of ashes, so you might want to do it discretely.

I roll my eyes. I am sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Tell no one what you are doing. NO ONE.", "NTA \n\nYou need to put her on an information diet. \n\nThe fact that she blames you that she got pregnant tells me that she is not a good person and is also stupid. I hope you will get to a point in your mental health journey that what this \"mother\" has to say does not affect you at all.", "NTA. I'm sorry about your dad. You do what gives you peace right now and don't worry about what anyone else thinks. My MIL remarried late in life, her second husband left her ashes with us and never asked what we did with them.

We decided to never tell him if he asked because he doesn't deserve to know.", "NTA\n\nSorry you lost your dad - great he stepped up for you when he met your mom. Too bad shes useless.. (sorry?)", "NTA, at all. And I wonder why you would even be in contact with her.", "YWNBTA and the only way she\u2019ll find out is if you tell other people. My advice, pragmatic and probably illegal as it is, is to keep silence. Don\u2019t tell your best friend, don\u2019t tell your aunt or your cousin or the housekeeper.  Distribute his ashes in your private memorial and keep silence. If she pitches a fit for the return of the ashes you stole, have some cremated chicken bones on hand to give her.", "NTA.

I mean, it doesn't make sense that she would forget like that.\n\nFor example : I want to get my mother's ashes back (*she wanted them to be put in her garden*) but my father prefers her to be in the cemetery so I'm waiting. I don't want to fight for it because it would hurt him so i'm waiting (*if I'm lucky to live long enough to get them back*).", "YTA.  You are making this all about you.  As the widow, she has the right to be there, even if it sucks for you.", "You've broke into a widow's home to steal half of her late husband of 30 years' ashes? That's messed up.\n\nYour mom fucked up on the trip. It's likely she wasn't emotionally ready to confront his death that way but she should have told you, so the two of you could find a solution. Not spring it on you on the trip. He was your father and this was also an incredibly emotional moment for you, it must have put you through the ringer. I'm sorry she did this to you. \n\nIt's her late husband of 30 years. I would invite her so she can say goodbye, even though she's difficult. ESH\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that your dad loved both of you for 30 years. Would he have wanted you to treat each other that way? Would he have wanted his wife to be excluded from his ash spreading and be surprised with the info that his ashes were gone forever after the fact?", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't think OP would tell her anyhow. But she will eventually find out. They always do. Too bad they don't use their snooping powers for good!", "Yep.", "Yes, yes, yes!\n\nHowever, in this case, it\u2019s 12 months since the death, mom knows her intention and knows she has the ashes. \n\nMy suggestion is to tell mom you want to scatter a portion of the ashes and set a time and date to go wherever you\u2019re going. See her reaction. If she\u2019s willing, you bring some of his ashes. She may try to ask you not to spread them for some reason. Concede. You can go the next week to do it alone. \n\nShe may not be ready to release him yet. She may have not picked up the ashes because she wasn\u2019t ready to deal with him being dead, and now she may not want him scattered all over the place. \n\nAnother option might be to give up scattering them at all, for now. Instead, take mother to a body of water and just talk about father and his life. Respect her, you have the rest of your life to do what you think is right with these ashes. Let her keep her husband with her if that\u2019s what she needs. There\u2019s literally no reason you should force her to grieve on your time table and no reason she should ask you to either. \n\nI\u2019m truly sorry about your father.", "NTA but I wouldn't tell her anymore. He was your dad and you deserve to honor him. If my mom left my dad's and for 6 months,  she'd never see them again.

And if she gets all huffy, remind her that you already invited her to a ceremony and she \"forgot\" to bring the guest of honour. NTA It is a lovely thing you are doing. My condolences on your loss.", "YWNBTA. I can't imagine a single reason why you should even consider the possibility.\n\nYour mom's reaction (if/when she eventually finds out) means absolutely NOTHING. She had all the chances in the world to do something with his ashes. The only thing she was ever stirred to do was\n\n1. Steal a free vacation from you under false pretenses\n2. Take away from you what she never cared enough to get for herself. (i.e., not letting you have his ashes mattered to her; actually having his ashes did not.)\n\nI considered the possibility that she just wasn't ready to deal with things before. She could have said that. What she said is that she wanted the vacation for her own relaxation, not to honor her late husband's wishes.\n\nIf there's anything she ever cares to do to honor her late husband, she has ashes she can do that with.\n\nAnd, while the husband/wife relationship is central; I notice that your mom doesn't care anything about your grieving of the loss of the only dad-figure you ever knew. Nor does she care anything about honoring his wishes or doing anything with you in his memory. You gave her that chance; it should have been her coming to you and offering those things. I don't think you owe your mom anything in this regard.", "Why would you invite her, or even tell her at all?

Mom could have so easily been overwhelmed with grief and not ready to deal with his ashes yet when the planned trip was taken. I think OP should invite her mom to the scattering at the lake. Mom can either come or not come but I\u2019m sure OP\u2019s dad would be heartbroken if he knew how much drama his ashes was causing the women he loved most.", "She did invite her and mom didn't bring the ashes... this is the second attempt", ">I assume she wants to keep his ashes with her.\n\nIf she really wanted her husband's ashes with her, she wouldn't have left his ashes at the funeral home for 5 months.", "She's been playing bingo 4 plus nights a week with her friends. Found out from one of them she's had bf for the past 6 months. My schedule is crazy so when I went to invite her to other things she already had plans like concerts or hobby things. She has been extremely active socially since his death. Idk maybe she grieves differently than me.", "When put like that, yta\n\nShe is grieving her husband, she's not handling it well, but it's *her* husband, *her* husband's remains.

Picking up the ashes means he's really dead and gone", "People do grieve in many very strange ways.", "People grieve very differently. It\u2019s not that unusual for someone to keep themselves really busy to avoid having to deal with the mental hurdle of having to deal with the loss of someone important to them.

I have asked numerous times and tried to organize us doing to finish her wishes and nothing ever comes of it. She has been gone 20 YEARS. Don\u2019t let this linger, follow your dad\u2019s wishes.", "NTA. I'm surprised you didn't take all the ashes and leave her an urn full of sand. \nHave the ceremony that is meaningful to you in private.  If she finds out and is angry, why would you care?", "Have you conveniently forgotten she \"forgot\" to collect his ashes for 6 months???? After she told op she already did?", "No, she picked up the ashes from the funeral home where the mother had left them for six months."]}
