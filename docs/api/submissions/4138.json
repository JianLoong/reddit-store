I'm 53F and my daughter is 16F.\n\nMy daughter has had a very rough month. Her dad (she lives with him, he and I separated a long time ago) was discovered to have colon cancer and needed to get surgery, so she stayed with her girlfriend's family for the week. Unfortunately her girlfriend's house caught on fire and everything spiraled into her girlfriend breaking up with her because her family thinks she did it. (She didn't, I know every parent says this but she's always been a super relaxed and introverted kid who hesitates to even kill bugs)\n\nBecause of all this the only place she had left to stay was with me (the rest of our family hold a grudge against her because shes my daughter, so they refused to take her in)\n\nI'm not in the best situation right now. I live with two friends that I recently made amends with, I don't have my own room or anything but any place to live is good. I've struggled with addiction my daughter's whole life, and I made a lot of horrible mistakes to her, so we have a bit of a strained relationship, but I'm really trying to be better.\n\nWhen she came over I only asked two things of everyone else:\n\n1. Keep the place relatively quiet, my daughter has chronic nightmares and barely gets enough sleep, so she passes out during the day a lot\n\n2. Don't stick around the living room while she's asleep, and by that I mean don't just sit down and watch TV or something. If she's awake it's okay (she told me herself)\n\nI'll keep context for that second one brief, but my daughter has gone through way more than she should have in the past and is known to react extremely when people touch her unexpectedly or strangers are too close to her. I didn't need her to wake up and have some strange man sitting next to her.\n\nI'll skip the unimportant stuff, but I heard yelling in the living room about a day in and ran to check. One of the men visiting was yelling at my daughter who looked scared out of her mind. I dragged him outside and a whole argument broke our.\n\nWhat happened was he 'apparently' didn't have a place to sit, so he sat next to my daughter who was sleeping on the couch. I'm not sure I can mention this next part, but I'll just say that she woke up, saw him there, and didn't take it well.\n\nI had EXPLICITLY told him not to do that beforehand, so I was pissed, but he said that if she was going to be such a little bitch she shouldn't even be staying over. I demanded he left, and my friends backed me up, but a few other people told me I was overreacting.\n\nI don't regret kicking him out but I do wonder if it was extreme.", "created_utc": 1670367385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zekvne/aita_for_kicking_out_a_guest_after_he_scared_my/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dude sounds creepy AF. \n\nIt sounds like maybe you haven\u2019t been able to be there for her as much as you would have liked to in her life.

I\u2019m sorry about what your daughter is going through, especially with her dad.\n\nYou are a *kickass* mom to take your daughter in with open arms even with your living situation, and you did everything you could to make it a comfortable environment for her.

Especially because she is a kid still and this is a grown man.", "Was the living room at the time meant for everyone?", "It sounds like the OP's daughter has a house, it's just that her dad is in hospital. Why she isn't still living there is beyond me--it's not ideal, but 16 is old enough to look after yourself, and it's far more preferable to whatever living situation the OP is in. Maybe there are laws against it where the OP is, but it would be perfectly legal in the UK for a 16 year old to live by themself permanently, let alone as a temporary measure.", "I'm definitely considering renting some hotel rooms for us until her dad gets out from hospital.

OP needs to ask her ex if they can shack up in his house so daughter is comfortable. Daughter also needs counseling.", "The living room is my room until further notice.

She's just a guest not a roommate", "This is what I was just wondering\u2026can you get permission to stay at his home with her, until he is out? It may be a win-win.", "I agree. Shaming her when she's dealt with addiction and is genuinely trying is just counter productive. Positively reinforcing the fact she's trying is a better way to go imo.", "It seems like the roommates are in agreement here that the living room is her room", "Ok I never gave a verdict all I said it's weird for a guest to be staying in someone else home and say this area is for my daughter no one comes in here.

She needs her own room someplace. Is there another relative that can take her in?", "YTA, so you are a guest crashing on their couch, you invite your daughter to do the same and then start laying down rules and kicking people out!?! \n\nI'm amazed you're still there although my guess is you're hanging on by a thread.\n\nIf you want to house your daughter you should be in a hotel or something.

I hope you can find a safe place to stay with her Op!", "NTA, without giving away personal info, are you getting assistance from Social Services (not sure if you are in the US or not)?  If not, go asap - like tomorrow.  Tell them your daughter is in your care due to an emergency  & you are in need of  temporary emergency housing. They should be able to put you up in a hotel until a more long-term situation can be arranged. Your daughter sounds like she has been through a lot of trauma, sadly.  But, you can help support her by stepping up now & getting her to a safe & structured environment until her dad is better. You got this!", "Yeah i agree with the others in here. The dude had sinister motives. I am not even sure at this point i am convinced she just happened to wake up i believe she woke up from being touched.

Super fucking shady. The daughter and OP acted appropriately.", "A sleeping 16 yr old thats by herself too. I could almost understand if everyones hanging out in the living room, but she was by herself. Go sit somewhere else you creep", "This is how I feel, too. An non-paying guest monopolizing the living room by having her daughter sleep on the couch is a weird situation, and I can see visitors not respecting that situation because it is an odd demand. OP needs to find a better living situation because this is not gonna last.", "From the comments: the living room is her bedroom", "Women's shelters can be like CVAN and stuff like that. Place that only take women and children would be perfectly safe for them. Agree basic homeless shelters wouldn't work and would be terrifying for the daughter. But a woman's protection shelter would be OK for both of them.", ">I'm fairly certain it is illegal for a 16-year old to be unsupervised alone for that length of time \n\nThat depends on the laws where the OP lives. As I mentioned, it's not illegal in the UK--in fact, it's legal for a 16 year old to decide to move out of their parents' house and live independently. It's rare, because who has the money to do that, and also landlords aren't exactly queuing up to rent to 16 year olds."]}
