I'm 53F and my daughter is 16F.\n\nMy daughter has had a very rough month. Her dad (she lives with him, he and I separated a long time ago) was discovered to have colon cancer and needed to get surgery, so she stayed with her girlfriend's family for the week. Unfortunately her girlfriend's house caught on fire and everything spiraled into her girlfriend breaking up with her because her family thinks she did it. (She didn't, I know every parent says this but she's always been a super relaxed and introverted kid who hesitates to even kill bugs)\n\nBecause of all this the only place she had left to stay was with me (the rest of our family hold a grudge against her because shes my daughter, so they refused to take her in)\n\nI'm not in the best situation right now. I live with two friends that I recently made amends with, I don't have my own room or anything but any place to live is good. I've struggled with addiction my daughter's whole life, and I made a lot of horrible mistakes to her, so we have a bit of a strained relationship, but I'm really trying to be better.\n\nWhen she came over I only asked two things of everyone else:\n\n1. Keep the place relatively quiet, my daughter has chronic nightmares and barely gets enough sleep, so she passes out during the day a lot\n\n2. Don't stick around the living room while she's asleep, and by that I mean don't just sit down and watch TV or something. If she's awake it's okay (she told me herself)\n\nI'll keep context for that second one brief, but my daughter has gone through way more than she should have in the past and is known to react extremely when people touch her unexpectedly or strangers are too close to her. I didn't need her to wake up and have some strange man sitting next to her.\n\nI'll skip the unimportant stuff, but I heard yelling in the living room about a day in and ran to check. One of the men visiting was yelling at my daughter who looked scared out of her mind. I dragged him outside and a whole argument broke our.\n\nWhat happened was he 'apparently' didn't have a place to sit, so he sat next to my daughter who was sleeping on the couch. I'm not sure I can mention this next part, but I'll just say that she woke up, saw him there, and didn't take it well.\n\nI had EXPLICITLY told him not to do that beforehand, so I was pissed, but he said that if she was going to be such a little bitch she shouldn't even be staying over. I demanded he left, and my friends backed me up, but a few other people told me I was overreacting.\n\nI don't regret kicking him out but I do wonder if it was extreme.", "created_utc": 1670367385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zekvne/aita_for_kicking_out_a_guest_after_he_scared_my/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are protecting your daughter and he completely disrespected you request because he felt entitled and likely thought you were full of shit about it.

Anyone who thinks you over reacted, clearly doesn\u2019t have a child with issues.", "NTA. Dude sounds creepy AF. \n\nIt sounds like maybe you haven\u2019t been able to be there for her as much as you would have liked to in her life. This is a great step towards working on repairing your relationship. Her feeling safe and her actual safety are most important.

Well done for that. This was you being a good parent, and helping your daughter reinforce her boundaries. She deserves to feel safe, and she didn't. The guy who did that after being asked not to was in the wrong. Stick to your guns, and be proud of yourself for having good instincts here.", "No it was not extreme. \n\nNTA. \n\nThat was a super creepy thing for him to do.", "NTA\n\nYou stood up for your daughter which is definitely what you should have done. The fact that he got so defensive is a huge red flag to me- most people would be understanding of your daughter\u2019s situation & apologize. The fact that he was so defensive makes me wonder if he had ulterior motives. You did what a good mom does which is to protect your daughter, especially during a time when she\u2019s vulnerable.", "NTA - what the fuck was this guy expecting when he broke the rule that'd been set in place to make a teenage girl feel safe? You and your roommates were clear about this rule too, and there were 100% other places to sit.

You enforced a rule and protected/stood up for your daughter all at once, good on ya.", "NTA for this but holy shit your daughter can't continue to live in this situation. Needs sorting asap", "NTA- you and your roommates make the rules since it\u2019s your house.

I\u2019m sorry about what your daughter is going through, especially with her dad.\n\nYou are a *kickass* mom to take your daughter in with open arms even with your living situation, and you did everything you could to make it a comfortable environment for her. Your roommates apparently didn\u2019t get the memo, and you weren\u2019t being too extreme.

Is the living room intended only for you and her or for everyone? Are you paying rent for the living room? If it\u2019s not your designated area, YTA", "NTA. It really wasn't. Especially because she is a kid still and this is a grown man.", "Was the living room at the time meant for everyone?", "It sounds like the OP's daughter has a house, it's just that her dad is in hospital. Why she isn't still living there is beyond me--it's not ideal, but 16 is old enough to look after yourself, and it's far more preferable to whatever living situation the OP is in. Maybe there are laws against it where the OP is, but it would be perfectly legal in the UK for a 16 year old to live by themself permanently, let alone as a temporary measure.", "I'm definitely considering renting some hotel rooms for us until her dad gets out from hospital. My friends even offered to lend me the money if I don't have enough.", "She's not an AH  but you're giving her wayyyy to much credit for stepping up after every other option wasn't available", "Read one of the ops replies. Living room is her current bedroom", "Exactly! It\u2019s all weird, why couldn\u2019t OP stay with her daughter at dads house? Her GF was the first option, why doesn\u2019t the family like her? \nDon\u2019t get me wrong guy seemed like a creep!", "I mean\u2026I also have questions. She says her bedroom is not available because her friend is still grieving the person who died in there. Maybe they were sick, but this household sounds chaotic. OP needs to ask her ex if they can shack up in his house so daughter is comfortable. Daughter also needs counseling.", "The living room is my room until further notice.

She's just a guest not a roommate", "This is what I was just wondering\u2026can you get permission to stay at his home with her, until he is out? It may be a win-win.", "I agree. Shaming her when she's dealt with addiction and is genuinely trying is just counter productive. Positively reinforcing the fact she's trying is a better way to go imo.", "It seems like the roommates are in agreement here that the living room is her room", "Ok I never gave a verdict all I said it's weird for a guest to be staying in someone else home and say this area is for my daughter no one comes in here.  Not saying they didn't agree saying it's weird and ill add slightly entitled", "Yh, I see how you feel it\u2019s weird."]}
