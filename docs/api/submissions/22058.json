I'm happy to keep a relationship with him, but something like paying for his college is just not the role I have in his life anymore. Troy got really upset, told me to go fuck myself and left.

He'd thank me. Maybe keep some surface level contact until his senior year is paid, and then I'd probably never have any meaningful contact with him again.  It is hard for me to realistically see myself with a substantial role in his life.  We got along well enough when I was married to Kate, but we weren't particularly close.

I just really don't see myself slotting in to any place in his life with that much of a role.  \n\nYeah, maybe a lunch here or there or a Christmas card.

However I also think it\u2019s pretty naive to say that a young man who grew up from 9-17 with you as his \u201cmother\u2019s husband\u201d would not consider you to be a father figure in addition to his own bio-dad. And a 17-19 year old is not an AH for not knowing how to understand or approach this relationship post-divorce. \n\nKate\u2019s TA for leading her son to believe you promised/owed him college money.", "Wow. So she knew ahead of time that this was already settled and wouldn\u2019t be paying for college and then sent him to you anyway. I wonder if she\u2019d prepared him ahead of time that this was addressed during the divorce or just banked on you not being able to turn him down to his face. NTA.", "NTA. Your former stepson is very entitled to ask for such a large favour when he hasn\u2019t even spoke to you in over 2 years.", "NTA. The boy is still young, and I bet his mom filled his ear with all kinds of bullshit about what you said and what he was \"owed\". \n\nThe fact that he hasn't contacted you or tried to maintain a relationship since the divorce says everything. Depending on the birthday, he was either very close to 18, or already there when the divorce happened. So, he would have been a legal adult for most of the separation period and fully capable of deciding for himself if he wanted to keep the relationship. \n\nHim only making contact now to ask for money, with no interest in a relationship outside of that is incredibly inappropriate. I have close blood relatives who I love dearly and talk to infrequently. Our position in each others' lives is beyond question. I would give them an organ if they needed it. But I know that it would be inappropriate of me to call them out of the blue and ask for a gift of thousands of dollars. And those are unbreakable blood ties, not former step-family. \n\nIf you feel inclined to give advice at all, and feel it might be received, you could do your former stepson the favor of inviting him to have a man-to-man chat again and advise him to call his school's financial counselors to go over his options. If his actual parents' financial situations have changed, he may be able to make changes to any applications for financial aid, and the school may have need-based programs that he might now qualify for. \n\nHe may also need to take a year off to get it figured out, or transfer to a lower-cost school, or take out loans (if and only if he's got a solid plan for paying the money back and isn't majoring in something like fine arts).", "Agree. And it sounds like he made the promise to Troy\u2019s mother, not to Troy. It also sounds like Troy didn\u2019t even know about the promise till his mom sent him to extract money from OP. If he\u2019d been promising the kid for years, I might feel differently, but this one\u2019s easy. NTA", "Did you mean NTA by chance?", "Wait she already tried this in the divorce, was told it was without any merit to obligate you to pay her sons college and she had the audacity gas him up and try again? \n\nThese are desperate people. She's wrong for that are should have been laying loan, scholarship and low cost study options, or saving before college if that was the situation they knew he was in. \n\nThey know they are wrong and they see you as a wallet, if don't comply it's abuse, which again is another tactic. I feel for the kid he's being lead astray badly by his mother's entitlement.", "Yes, yes I did :)", "Good, vote changed!", "NTA\n\nKate is a coward. She lied to Troy about op paying for his college knowing full well that the matter was decided against her during the divorce. Time for her to be more of a parent and less of a coward.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour reasoning about how the situation has changed is impeccable, so of course you won't pay for his college.\n\nBut when he called you, for the first time in two years, did you really think he was doing it out of affection? When estranged relatives contact us, it nis always because they want money and nothing else.\n\nSo as soon as you said you won'\\[t give him money, he flew into a rage and told you to fuck yourself, because you were, to him, nothing but an ATM. \n\nWhy didn't you know that when he called?\n\nAnd as for his mother, all she cares about is money, just like her son. So of course she expresses her rage at you by accusing you of being what she is, a money-grubber. She almost certainly is the one who dreamed up this lunch in the first place. No wonder you got divorced from that.\n\nI can't understand you Reddit posters and your fantasy world of a stepson who wants a relationship, as opposed to the truth: a stepson who says I hate you gimme money.", "NTA", "NTA, they were using you and they seem entitled.", "NTA. Go live your life away from those people. They're just trying to get you down.", "NTA.\n\nIf there was still a relationship post divorce between OP and Troy then this wouldn't be the first time in two years he had heard from him.", "Plenty of cases on this sub where children even younger than 9 never see their parent's spouse as a parental figure. It's simply their parent's spouse.\n\nSeems to happen more often when spouse (or parent and spouse) tries to push that the spouse is a parent when the child doesn't want that.", "Why does Kate even still have your phone number? She should only have your lawyer's phone number.\n\nAnd, unless you've got some ongoing financial arrangement with her, there's no reason she should be contacting the lawyer either.", "Oh no, telling a WOMAN to stfu, the horror."]}
