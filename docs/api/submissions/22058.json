We divorced two years ago largely because we just couldn't get along anymore. If it matters, the decision to divorce was mutual. Kate has a son Troy (M19).  Troy would split his time between our place and his father's.  \r  \n\r  \nI got along reasonably well with Troy. He is a good kid, but was always a bit of a moody kid and he had a bit of a volatile relationship with his parents--although I guess that is pretty typical of any teenager to a degree. However, I didn't get caught up in those conflicts because it was clear he didn't see me as a father figure.  Nor did I try to be anything more to him than his mother's husband. I treated him kindly and with respect, would help him out with anything he reasonably asked me and also pitched in with errands like giving him rides, helping him with homework, fixing his bike, etc. But for the most part, I left the parenting to his two actual parents.\r  \n\r  \nThen yesterday Troy gave me a call. The first time I had heard from him since the divorce. He is back from college for the summer and asked if we could have lunch. I was more than happy to catch up with him. However, as the meal was drawing to a close, he asked me if I could help him pay for next year's college. Kate had told him that before we got divorced, I had promised her that I'd help pay for Troy's college. Which I did. But, we divorced before that happened. Kate had lost her job a few months before and Troy didn't know how he would pay for next year. \r  \n\r  \nI told Troy that I'm really sorry things went that way, but things are different now. His mother and I are not married anymore and we are all going our separate paths. I am no longer married to his mother and don't have the role in his life that I used to. I'm happy to keep a relationship with him, but something like paying for his college is just not the role I have in his life anymore. Troy got really upset, told me to go fuck myself and left.  A few hours later, Kate calls me and is absolutely enraged. She tells me that all I care about is money and don't care about Troy. \r  \n\r  \nI told her \"Actually genius, if you were paying attention, you would see you have it backwards. I haven't heard from Troy in two years and within an hour he is asking me for a huge sum money. I told Troy I'm happy to have a relationship with him. However, he threw that back in my face and told me to go fuck myself when I told him I can't give him the money.\" She continues screaming down the phone until I tell Kate to shut the fuck up and never contact me again.

You can't be held to that promise, given your current circumstance. You owe neither of them anymore of yourself, your time, or your money. And block both their numbers. You don't need either one of them in your life anymore.", "NTA.

Actually, this story makes me kind of sad because Troy could probably use a loving adult in his life like you.", "Nta\n\nYou already know why you're not. He's not your stepson and only contacted you for money.", "Oof, that's rough. NTA and I'm sorry Troy only saw you as a piggy bank", "NTA - while going back on your word is a *bit* crappy, it isn't like we are talking about you paying for dinner. Expecting you to chip in tens of thousands of dollars years later when he didn't treat you like a parent is pretty unreasonable.", "NAH, it sounds like Troy probably can\u2019t afford to continue going to college even with financial support from his parents, so when found that out from Kate he got desperate and I empathize with that as he\u2019s probably run out of options that don\u2019t put him in extreme debt. However I understand when you made the promise it was under the pretext that you were still his stepfather. Cursing you out was definitely not right, but it\u2019s understandable that he would be upset about it. \n\nIf there is an AH its Kate for taking your promise out of context and getting his hopes up", "ESH.\n\nYou are not the AH for not paying for your former stepson tuition. That is too big of a request and absolutely ridiculous, as you were never a father figure. You are the AH for how rudely and aggressively you talked to your ex afterwards.

He'd thank me. Maybe keep some surface level contact until his senior year is paid, and then I'd probably never have any meaningful contact with him again.  It is hard for me to realistically see myself with a substantial role in his life.  We got along well enough when I was married to Kate, but we weren't particularly close. Kate is pursuing new relationships--as is her right.  I just really don't see myself slotting in to any place in his life with that much of a role.  \n\nYeah, maybe a lunch here or there or a Christmas card. But I don't foresee standing with him at his wedding, having a relationship with his children, him being there with me as my own years get on, etc.  If I did, I'd consider contributing some money.

He showed his true colours so quickly!", "Wow\u2026 NTA..", "She was more aggressive with him, all he did was point out the facts and her hypocrisy", "So why is OP the asshole here?", "They see him as an ATM and you think he's the bad guy, that's wild", "So she just tried to guilt you through Troy into extracting the cash from you. This is all on her. She knew he cannot get the money. She had no business involving him in this.", "Your response to Kate was perfect. I've seen countless posts like these but never an answer as good as yours. NTA, she had to scream at you because she knew you were right", "I wonder, then, why you mentioned the argument at all? Sorry, but you were too rude and abusive for that not to factor in the judgment. Hope you find healing.", "So she\u2019s allowed to scream at him but he has to keep utmost respect and dignity in their conversations?", "She's wrong too, but look at what he said. Calling her genius, telling a woman to stfu, bringing lawyers into the discussion, etc. Thank God they didn't have kids.", "Why not bring lawyers into the discussion? She\u2019s trying to make him pay money and he doesn\u2019t want to. He\u2019s trying to resist a claim that he\u2019s obligated to. And he probably got enraged in the moment by her screaming and entitlement. It wasn\u2019t a good thing to say, but he\u2019s human, it\u2019s hard to be talking in the most dignified way when the other side doesn\u2019t"]}
