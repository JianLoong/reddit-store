I recently left my job a couple months ago, but before I left I considered myself to be really close with some of my co-workers. Problem is after I left I learned the hard way that we\u2019re not as close as I thought. They stopped inviting me out to things, and some of them were invited to my bridal shower and didn\u2019t even acknowledge the invite or RSVP\u2019ing. Some of them RSVP\u2019d yes, and then just no-showed with no call or text or explanation. The final straw was that some of them were invited to my bachelorette party, and they had originally said they would be there, but then again no-showed and with no call or text. This actually bothers me more than the bridal shower because this caused my MOH who planned the entire event to have to cover their share and she was out more money (I offered to help with expenses but they were insistent I have no part in planning or organizing the event and when I tried to just hand them money they refused to take it). Problem is, I did send them save the dates and I recognize it\u2019s poor wedding etiquette to revoke an invite after doing so, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on me to reach out to them and salvage the situation. Invites are going out in the mail in about a month or two and I\u2019m just really conflicted.

Is that a thing now?", "NTA. They probably wouldn't come anyway. Don't worry about maintaining your relationship with them anymore.", "NTA just don't send the invites.

Up until now, your former coworkers only have a date, they do not have the time, the venue, the dress code, etc. \n\nYou would not be out of line for not sending them a formal invitation. If they question it (which I highly doubt), you can tell them what you\u2019ve told us: you stopped spending time with me and you no-showed at events you already promised to attend, without so much as an explanation.", "NTA. Do not send them invites. It is one thing to cancel or not respond to an RSVP. It is entirely another to RSVP and no show. This costs hosts a lot of money. Screw them.", "NTA. \n\nGuess they ain't getting an invite. I wouldn't send them any. Invite your real friends. \n\nClearly they don't care.", "NTA - you\u2019re just adjusting to their pattern of behavior.\n\nThis is why I dislike big weddings! It becomes a show\u2026a sh!t show where 95% of the people really don\u2019t care if the marriage lasts or not! Weddings should be where a couple surround themselves with loving and supportive people. People who will be there during the good, the bad, and the ugly!", "NTA, fuck that. Don\u2019t send the invite and don\u2019t worry about it either, they obviously don\u2019t care.", "NTA. \n\nThey probably wouldn\u2019t show up to your wedding in any event. After RSVPing and saddling you with the costs of their plates.", "NTA, you have 3/choices:\n\n1) don\u2019t send invites, honestly they probably won\u2019t even notice or register.  They have blown you off at every juncture - why would this be any different?  \n\n2) invite them, maybe they\u2019ll rsvp.  If they say yes, good chance they will be no shows and further financially screw you over.  \n\n3) try to contact them to see if they still want an invitation.  A lot of effort, they will probably try to blow you off.  If you do reach them they will probably say yes to get rid of you and again be no shows.\n\nChose option 1, stop wasting you time and energy on people who don\u2019t care.  Save it for your real friends.", "NTA. They've gone no contact, and including not turning up to your bachelorette without explanation.  \n\nIf you are not bothered about having them there, but feel guilty about not inviting them after a save the date, you could consider a brief message them to say numbers/plans have altered slightly so you can't invite them.  \n\nIf you had indicated you would like to have them there, but were concerned about a repeat of the RSVP yes then not show up situation you had at your bachelorette, you could've (if the type of celebration allows) invite them to the evening celebrations (after dinner).  But I get the impression this doesn't apply.", "NTA. No need to send invitations or explain yourself and waste your time. These people obv do not care in any case.", "NTA.", "NTA they aren't going to come anyway", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re a lot more invested here than they are.

Don't invite them.", "If they actually accepted invitations to events and then completely flaked without an explanation or warning, I think it\u2019s safe to assume they aren\u2019t going to come to the wedding even if they got an invite. Don\u2019t feel bad. Since you don\u2019t really talk to them anymore, they are hardly going to complain you didn\u2019t invite them. NTA", "NTA. Some may disagree but I definitely think you should revoke them. Tell them they were uninvited because they didn\u2019t show up to other things they RSVPed for and because of that, they\u2019re no longer people you think belong at your wedding. You\u2019re never going to see these people again by the sound of it, so you have nothing to lose.", "NTA\n\nSave the date is not an invite. Don't worry about it.", "YTA if you don't invite people you sent a save the date to without a very good reason (e.g., a friend stole from you, said extremely rude things to you, etc.).\n\nIf these former co-workers continue to not be very close anymore, it is likely that most of them will either RSVP \"no\" or not RSVP at all.\n\nTo be sure, it's your wedding and it is within your right to not invite people you said you would invite. But a save-the-date implies that an invitation is forthcoming--that's why you ask people to save the date. YWBTA if you do not send an invitation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
