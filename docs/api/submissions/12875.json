Now, this is where I think I am the AH. I told her we should look at strollers on the cheaper side. They look the same and as far as I can tell, they do the exact same.

Make sure you're communicating openly about what sort of stroller you're looking for.\n\nA few things to consider:\n\n* Weight\n* Size\n* Baby comfort (sufficient visors, plush materials, etc.)\n* Sturdiness (good wheels, long-lasting materials, etc.)\n* Cupholders (for baby bottles and whatnot)\n* Basket installments (such as for holding a diaper bag underneath)\n* Flexibility (can it work for babies *and* toddlers? is it adjustable?)\n* Price\n\nQuality *does* matter when it comes to a baby's stroller.

You can get a stroller on consignment for sure, but normally the stroller goes with the car seat.", "[deleted]", "INFO: what kind of car seat will accommodate a child from birth to age 8?  It\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve had a kid in a car seat but I\u2019m a bit skeptical of this, especially since the typical car seat has a  six-year expiration date.", "NTA for asking for her reasoning. That said, if you are going to jog or run with baby / toddler or at going to regularly use the stroller going out over the next 5 years, definitely go with a nice one. It saves money in the long run.", "Not sure on the judgement, because honestly it depends on what you actually *said* to each other.\n\nFirst I want to address the \"something we will only use for 6 years\" comment... That's $83 per year, under $7 per month... and a stroller *is* a necessity. Do I think $500 is necessary? Depends. \n\nIf you live in an area without many sidewalks, you're going to want a stroller with extra sturdy supports, axles, and *big* wheels.\n\nIf you live in a metro area, or you'll be going into lots of shops with the stroller, you'll probably want a jogger.\n\nIf you have 2 cars, you'll likely want to keep a car seat in each (and if you've only one car, and the car seat is *in* the car, you'll need a second one so your wife won't be trapped at home!) ... so you will probably want a convertible stroller, which comes *with* a carseat. That means the extra $400 you'd spend on a new car seat is part of that stroller cost.\n\nYou'll want a fairly large basket space underneath the stroller, because babies... and even more so, toddlers, accumulate things.\n\nIf your wife goes out a lot or is fairly active, she's likely to take baby out often, and it can be useful for the stroller to have a decent tray, both for the child, and for the parent!\n\nIn *any* case, you're going to want good sun protection. Most strollers come with a little canopy, but if you live somewhere extremely sunny, or conversely, with lots of inclement weather, you'll probably want one which can completely shield your little one.\n\n\nSome strollers can also convert to be front or back facing, like [this](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTAGluyG5H3l6HerxCxkoEZjPExU2H7SnM9zdxYWq-feL9XXj5N4J7s9luQi9ykQNlCQZLl2-5KlAsNkq2rT250nVorLyHopR1MmQwLhXtxdzg58054jJiEtw), which can be helpful if your wife is either very short or very tall... your arms get *hella* sore.\n\nMost strollers have at least a 3 point harness, but some only have a lap belt, which is not safe for younger babies. \n\nSome strollers have a back which barely reclines, or which doesn't sit up all the way. \n\nSome strollers are literally hell to fold. And a really cheap (quality, not price) stroller might fold when you don't want it to. \n\nThere's a lot that goes into the decision. $500 isn't unreasonable. $300 isn't cheaping out. It *entirely* depends on what you need from a stroller.\n\nIf your wife was looking at more expensive strollers because they have the features she needs... that's appropriate.\n\nIf you were setting a price ceiling because you genuinely can't afford it... that's appropriate.\n\nIf you talked about it like adults, if:\n\n>They look the same and as far as I can tell, they do the exact same.\n\nand\n\n> I asked her to tell me what the $800 stroller can do, that the $300 can't do.\n\nwere said in a reasonable tone, out of genuine desire for more information, and \n\n>She told me the expensive ones were nicer and they were \"better\".\n\nwas a genuine effort to show you that baby's needs matter, then... no assholes here.\n\nIf however, she was just brushing you off because she wanted a fancy stroller for pinterest, whether or not you can afford it... she's an AH\n\nIf your tone was full of doubt or derision, or just over-confidence that *none* of the pricier strollers could be \"better\" as she said, then you're an AH.\n\nUnless you're going to default to a cheap (price, and quality) $20 umbrella stroller, then you need to talk about all the pros and cons, her *needs* as the person who will be using the stroller, and what's actually feasible with the *household* budget. \n\nFor now, I'm going to assume you both had the best of intentions, and go with NAH.", "I'd want to hear your wife's actual reasons for liking the more expensive stroller. But you should listen. A stroller is absolutely a necessity\u2014how do you think you and she are going to get around places with your baby in tow? \n\nI don't know enough about the price ranges on these, but I do know that there might be a huge difference in maneuverability, ease of use, etc. If she's going to be using it on her own more than you are, then she should have something that works well and is easy to use.", "A stroller lasts for 3-4 years so it actually is a good ROI if you can afford it. You can ask her to present some evidence and go check them out to compare. NTA for asking for further evidence but be ready to be convinced.", "NTA. I had a $100 stroller and used it less than the $25 umbrella strollers I bought to keep in the trunk. \n\nThe only expensive strollers that might be worth it are ones that fold up small and are extra light for taking on mass transit.", "Oh dear, you are in for a massive shock on the cost of raising children.\n\nI am going to ESH. Sounds like you both need to get on the same page about finances and what you can afford - perhaps a better second hand pram is the middle ground.\n\nAs someone who has used shit prams, the better ones are absolutely worth the reliability and money. You see parents struggling to collapse a pram to put in the car, or being unable to go on certain surfaces in a park all the time. As for cost. Maybe I am used to exorbitant prices, but $800 for something that will be used 365 days a year for the next 8 years (assuming multiple children) sounds like great value - FYI the cheap pram isnt lasting 8 years.", "ESH \n\nA baby stroller will become a necessity once the baby is born and she/y\u2019all begin taking the baby out. I would say not to look at the price, but the quality of the strollers, really research them, the reviews, and post the question in groups with parents (Facebook) about what other parents recommend. There are so many different strollers out there now that have features that make going out with a baby more convenient. \n\nAlso you can keep items like that and hand them down to someone else in the family after you\u2019re done using them or pass them down to your kids way in the future because just like you\u2019re experiencing baby stuff is expensive for the quality/convenient items.", "I had three strollers. \n\nTwo were second-hand and one I brought at the shops. I spent $150 on the third one. It was a good brand and a few years old at the time. It was a great pram, easy to get parts (had to replace front wheel, buy a rain cover and tray). It was the best $150 I'd spent on my child. If I ever have another child, I'd buy the same pram either second hand or outright.", "Nta, but you both need to do more research.  You do want to make sure the stroller is sturdy and will roll easily. You don't want your baby being thrown around because it doesn't roll well.  You do want a stroller because the alternative is to carry the baby everywhere,  and the stroller will also carry all the other items you need - bottles,  diapers,  extra clothes,  the list goes on. \n\nHow important is it to you to be able to carry all the things you need to care for the baby when you go out?", "Depending on the stroller you will get YEARS out of it. My wife and I have a newborn and our expensive car seat/stroller combo gave us his car seat and stroller with a bassinet that will fit my son till he\u2019s probably 5 or 6", "NTA. Graco all day!", ">I asked her to tell me what the $800 stroller can do, that the $300 can't do. \n\nI don't see anything wrong with you asking this. I also think that much money for a stroller is too much. Sure the more expensive one maybe has better materials, more accessories and side-functions, and better aftersales support but I don't think it should be worth that much for you to have something that will last you for years and work great for you and your baby's needs.\n\nI'm going with NTA for now.\n\nMaybe this is something much deeper than just the stroller, as to why your wife is upset. Not sure if it's the hormones too. I hope she talks to you soon enough so that you can both get this fixed.\n\nedit:\n\nI'd also like to add that strollers would usually be a necessity by around until 3 years.", "I had a crappy stroller (the umbrella one) in the beginning because my ex was cheap too. It hurt my back and my forearms to push my baby around it, it rattled, it sucked. I upgraded to a baby yoyo zen2 ($400 ish) for traveling but I splurged on a Bugaboo ($800) on sale and that baby was a fucking cadillac. It was super nice and my kid would refer to it as the \"big poussette\" and refuse the babyzen. It was really nice to have great sun protection, a canopy he would pull down, recline flat to nap in comfortably and reverse so the baby could face you, etc. It also has great resale value. \n\nFor a newborn I would definitely get the Doona now. They sleep in the car seat so you really want to wake up the sleeping baby everytime you get in and out of the car when you can just transfer the carseat into a stroller?\nYou discount how often you want to be out and about and taking your baby for daily walks is really important so they get fresh air.\n\n It's like I was also shamed into buying a cheap one and he had to pay for it later when the cheap one broke apart and killed my back/shoulders/arms etc. Carrying a baby will also kill your back after you just gave birth. It's an investment that you don't want to cheap out on, but plenty of people also get a stroller for less than $300. I know you can get a jogger that will grow with your kid, but I feel bad for kids in $20 umbrella strollers, it does not look comfortable at all as they feel every bump and pebble. I also fail to see how it's any less important than a carseat as they will probably spend more time in the stroller considering how active you and your wife are. I think it's an important purchase, but everyone has varying degrees of money they are willing to spend. I wish I had gotten a quality one in the beginning though.\n\nAs you can see I had a bit of an obsession with strollers with my newborn. There are different strollers to get at different stages too. Like the babyzen I would get when they're past 2, as it's more for toddlers in cities or if you get on a plane it's light. The Bugaboo was so obnoxiously huge, but I loved it so much and so did my kid. They both had baby bassinets, but different ones are better for different stages. I wish I had gotten the Doona when he was a newborn.", "NTA. It sounds like you were trying to analyze the costs and benefits logically and she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. She just wanted to buy the one she wanted without thinking much about it.

Congrats to you both on your baby btw!", "NTA. Your point is valid.\n\nThe fact that she\u2019s been giving you the silent treatment for *a week* over this (or anything, really) is concerning.

We also were all about the higher quality car seat for safety reasons, but got our high chair, swing and play center second hand from a friend. They were save an did the job.

What are her reasons for wanting this particular stroller?

You said a car seat is a necessity but not a stroller and I disagree, how will the child navigate the world outside of the car? How will mom go grocery shopping, grab coffee, or go to the park without the baby if not with a stroller? \n\n3. Can you find the expensive stroller on a resell site like Facebook marketplace?", "NAH, but you need to talk about this.\n\nKids will outgrow things fast, including strollers. I can't remember exactly but I don't think I used mine for either kid past the age of four. Car seats are different, at least in my mind. You'll use them longer, kids do need to be in them for several years, and they need to keep your kid safe in a moving vehicle. \n\nI doubt your wife will be able to answer why she wants an $800 stroller. But perhaps the two of you could investigate strollers. I don't know how often you'll use it or under what circumstances. If you live in a city, you might want something different than if you live in the suburbs.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nAlso you're not gonna use the same stroller for 6-8 years, that's ridiculous.", "NTA.

Sometimes you're just paying for a logo, but sometimes the more expensive ones are actually better. \n\nGet yourselves onto YouTube and watch some stroller review videos. Figure out what features you're looking for in a stroller (there are even videos that go over this!) Do you want a stroller you can easily add a second seat to? Do you want one that folds down small for travel? Do you want one that that has a nicer sun shade? Do you want one with easily replaceable parts?

So much better for places like the zoo and fruit picking outages.", "You\u2019re NTA for not wanting to spend $800 on a stroller per se, but only if you have seriously considered your wife\u2019s reasons for wanting that particular stroller. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest with you that for something that you use every day like that the difference between a cheaply made poorly designed stroller and one that you don\u2019t have to fuck around with can be well worth the money - picture yourself being sleep deprived and how it feels when it seems like nothing just fucking works the way it\u2019s supposed to or is being easy for you and then you have to get more formula cause you\u2019re out so you haul your ass to the grocery store and it\u2019s raining and your shitty fucking shit stroller won\u2019t fucking stay unfolded or whatever dumb design flaw. \n\nIn that moment the $300 becomes worth it for both the stroller but also the lack of resentment your wife is gonna feel a bit of every time that cheap shitty stroller does something cheap or shitty im just saying", "NAH. The stroller car seat combo and fancy strollers will last you for about a year. I\u2019d recommend instead getting a good foldable, durable umbrella stroller. They are around $100 and will last until around four years old. We traveled all over Europe with ours.", "We got a cheap(ish) stroller/pram but spent big money on a bike trailer/jogger and that worked for us. The stroller sits in the back of the car just for zipping around the shops but the adventure wagon does all the big walks and stuff", "$500 is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter. For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible!\n\nJk, NAH. Watch some reviews online before you guys decide", "NTA. I considered a range of different strollers from Graco to Nuna. As a first time mom, I didnt know any better so I gravitated more towards a Nuna because of its chic look and hefty price tag. When asked, I couldnt justify why I wanted a  Nuna over other brands because..well..there was no good justification other than a woman wanting other women to know shes sporting a luxury stroller. Its like wanting a Chanel handbag when a no-name brand could offer better quality. I ended up coming to my senses and getting a less expensive but highly reviewed stroller and im glad I did because I only used it sparingly for one year. Once my kid learned how to walk, he refused to sit in a stroller. Maybe borrow or rent a few different strollers and compare them to the one your wife wants and see if her choice is truly and overwhelmingly \u201cbetter\u201d than the rest. Its unlikely.", "The only way I could get my hair done when my son was a toddler was to wait until he was asleep in the stroller and drive him into the salon. I used that thing for 4 years. It cost me $250 \u2014 27 years ago. Strollers are expensive OP and a good one is better than a cheap one. Ask people you know who have already been there.", "I paid $15k for my car. Where are my free tune-ups for life? \ud83d\ude01", "Dang, I forgot to include anything about the weight or the fabric in my reply, lol\n\nGood job, you were way more concise than I was, have an updoot :P", "Can\u2019t say enough about the sturdy wheels. Maneuverability too, if you live in a city and have weird sidewalks like we do, cobblestone, broken sidewalks, etc. a nightmare with flimsy wheels.", "NAH I agree. Wife is just trying to make the best choice but going about it in a not perfect way. She needs to do more research not just pick the most expensive option.", "I will add that a full recline is a necessity.", "The ease of opening and closing it to take it in and out of the car.", "As a second time parent I honestly skipped the stroller that came with our bucket car seat and have just been using the super cheap umbrella stroller this time around and lo is only 4 months old.", ">Kid wont be in it past 4 years \n\nMy kid didn't want to be in one when he was past 1 year old so we didn't even get much value from the stroller.", "I put a combo set on my baby registry and it was $400 for seat and stroller and base", "Haha beat me to it", "Yes, I chuckled at 6 to 8 years.", "Thanks, which is what I plan on doing like we did with the car seat once she can open up to be again about the stroller...", "There are a lot of car seats now that go birth to booster and last for 10 years. Tho most newborns do not fit  well in those forever type seats.", "I honestly have no idea. We were looking at seats together and she settled on one and I agreed. She is part of a lot of Facebook groups for new moms and such and I guess many are saying they keep their kids in rear facing car seats til the age of 7? It's all new to me but if that's what most doctors and parents are recommending I guess...", "A stroller is really not a necessity depending on where you live. I live in an urban area in a townhouse with steps an 8/10 times I wore the baby. The stroller was only for if I needed to carry baby+groceries or something. \n\nAnd I bought a fancy bigger stroller new\u2026 and I had some smaller more portable ones handed down or bought used. Guess which we used most? The big one ended up being used for the walking commute to daycare in snow, and then we sold it for about half the price we paid by the time kiddo was like\u2026 4?", "That's what I am trying to figure out. I can understand wanting a stroller for going outside and for easier access and storage in the trunk, but TBH she is the biggest home body I know and we hardly ever went out. (Netflix and Chill all the way) so I think as a new mom she is setting these expectations for herself that she is gonna go all over the place like parks and play grounds. Which is great, but we live in a place that has a lot of local paved trails and parks just a few blocks down from our home.", "I\u2019m not sure a stroller is even a true necessity. Baby wear + backpack diaper bag is good for a long time for many.", "I will look into that!", "Yes, it's an emotional thing for her. Many new parents want only the best for their first.\n\nThen later on you're buying 10 for $10 items at the consignment store....", "Doubtful.  The child sits and you push.", "I'd cut them both some slack. They're going to be new parents, and they're naturally going to be a bit on-edge about it. The silent treatment is unproductive and unhelpful, but she's pregnant and trying to think about what's best for the baby.\n\nThey should have a discussion about it, but I don't think this incident alone warrants a \"larger discussion about \\[their\\] relationship.\"", "I honestly have been blaming the hormones and the nerves of pregnancy so I am not very worried TBH.", "I have tried the second hand market point, but she is convinced that there might be something missing or broken with second hand items. Again, new baby nerves but we will see.", "Clearly you've never pushed an $800 stroller. You couldn't pay me to push a hundred dollar piece of plastic crap from walmart and it has nothing to do with Instagram.", ">And kids don\u2019t use strollers until age 6. \n\nYou mean after, right?", "We don't have a registry yet. If she wants to add it to the registry then I won't stop her, but I won't be surprised if no one wants to buy it as it is very expensive and I would never expect anyone, friends or family, to purchase something like that. And, maybe I over reacted on the week part? Idk her responses have been short and curt and when I try to bring up the subject she cuts me off.", "Yep, second they we good at walking. If there was a stroller they\u2019d rather push it lok", "Also look at the resale value of bigger ticket items like on FB marketplace or if you have a kid-to-kid thrift store or consignment shops in your area. I\u2019ve sold a lot of my kid\u2019s outgrown stuff to recoup the expense.", "You can also get \u201ctravel systems\u201d. Mine included a stroller that the included baby carrier would snap into it for when baby was young. The baby carrier also had a base and could be used as a rear facing car seat. The stroller would then function as a proper stroller until your child outgrows it.", "But the kid will be already for a booster far earlier than 10 years.  If they are truly committed to having only one child, they shouldn\u2019t be worried about getting more than about four years after a convertible car seat. \n\nAnd yeah, if he really surprised if there was a car seat that maximized safety for both a newborn and a 4 yo.", "Personally, when my wife had our first child my only concern for the stroller was the car seat that came with it. It is a HUGE convenience to be able to use the same seat for the car as the stroller (with a base of course). To satisfy both yours and your wife\u2019s concern get an extremely safe baby car seat that comes with a good stroller combo. The baby car seat won\u2019t last forever but for as long as it does transferring baby to and from the car will be possible without waking.", "Um no.\nRear facing \u201cas long as possible\u201d still caps out for most kids around age 3 due to comfort in the car and weight limits for rear facing that are about 40 pounds.\n\nBut there are some Graco convertible ones that do supposedly last this long. We haven\u2019t used them though- Britax family over here.", "No, you keep a child in a rear facing seat until they are 12 to 18 months until they out grow the seat.  Then the seat turns forward until they are about 5-6 but it all depends on how large the child is and how fast they grow.\n\nI have never used a stroller for more than a year, with the exception of umbrella strollers (about $25 new) that are just seats with wheels, but the best thing ever created.\n\nMy advise is to start going to yard sales and pick up all the gently used expensive items that someone else decided to pay $800 for that you can have for cheap.  Babies don\u2019t need new ASIDE FROM CAR SEATS AND CRIBS.  Never buy one of those second hand.", "I think you should really look at the features on the different models and keep an open mind. And keep in mind what will make things easier for your wife.", "They have stroller videos on YouTube! I want to say I watched Magic Beans. It\u2019s a baby store. I will say i was like your wife. The stroller and car seat were. Wry important to me. We had cheap strollers and sometimes the wheels/setting it up/closing can be annoying. I also thought I\u2019d take my baby out for walks around our neighborhood. But she was born in February lol. She\u2019s probably just very excited about being able to do these activities with the baby soon.", "But eventually the baby will grow out of the baby wear and carrying the baby while going shopping can sometimes suck\u2026. That\u2019s why I pointed out the convenience of a stroller and possibly a more expensive stroller will have more features.", "I didn\u2019t word that well. \n\nI don\u2019t think they need to split up or anything. I meant more that they have to work on communication and \u201cfighting fair.\u201d A week of silent treatment just sounds really extreme to me.", "That\u2019s good to hear. I hope you all can have a nice chat soon. Congratulations!", "Most towns have consignment stores for kids stuff.  They don't sell broken or recalled products.  Might be worth checking out", "Oh yes! Sorry. Distracted by my own kids.\nAfter is what I mean.", "A lot of times people will go in together on larger gifts like that. Still gets you what\u2019s on the registry without costing any one person a large sum. \n\nDefinitely worth putting on, worst that happens is you don\u2019t get it :)", "But car seats should not be purchased second hand unless you can prove it hasn\u2019t been in an accident.", "[deleted]", "Well shoot, if I had known that I wouldn't have jumped the gun so quickly on the car seat!", "Britax One4Life allows for rear facing up to 50lb just FYI - it\u2019s why we chose it", "For several years the recommendation has been to keep them rear facing for as long as they meet the car seat limitations. 12 months is WAY too soon to turn them around. They are far safer in a crash if rear facing.", "In my (first-world but not US) country, it's mandatory to keep kids rear-facing until they're 2 years old, then in a booster until they're 148cm tall (uhhhh four and a half feet? I think? Age about 10ish, anyway). \n\nThe idea of keeping a kid rear facing until they're 7 made my eyes bug out. My kids are 5 and 8 and neither of them could possibly rear-face - where would their legs go??? \n\nBut the key thing is: **never cheap out on things that go between your baby and the ground**. Car seats, cots, strollers, and eventually shoes.", "I think that depends on the environment you live in. In a rural/suburban area, baby wearing for the 1st 6ish months and then sitting baby in the cart works just fine. \n\nA cheap stroller would have done us fine 95% of the time.", "In that case, I agree. Communication is important, especially with a baby on the way.", "Most of those all in one car seats are poor fits for newborns and overly bulky for boosters. \n\nIt is much more cost-effective to buy a convertible and then a booster.", "So\u2026 you\u2019ve done no research at all, but are criticizing your wife\u2019s decisions based on her own research and her talks with other moms who actually use these things.  YTA.  Majorly.  You need to step it up before you become a dad.\n\nThat stroller is similar pricing to a bike, btw - not unreasonable.  I bet your wife will probably use it a lot - since she is the one who\u2019s going to be at home taking your kid on walks and outings.", "Also depends on if you even own a car, walking around pushing a stroller is alot easier than carrying a baby and all the supplies. Seems like it's not a problem for OP but it can definitely be a necessity for some people", "Exactly.  Newborns need more protection that those seats provide, and by the time your kid is old enough for a booster so you will be thrilled to get rid of the bulky, annoying convertible seat and switch to an easy, lightweight booster.", "That's not accurate. It's not they that they need more protection.... the protection in an all in one is the same as a convertible. The problem is they just don't fit small babies well. \n\nIt like clothing abeled once size fits all....it usually fits no one correctly.", "I think we are saying the same thing different ways."]}
