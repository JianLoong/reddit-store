Last week we went out to look at baby thing we might and will need in the near future. Other than necessities like swaddles, a crib, diapers, etc we also looked at other things like different toys, outfits, and gadgets like monitors. Well, when we got to the stroller section most of the strollers my Wife was interested were well over $500, the one she wanted had to be at least $800 before taxes. Now we are pretty good financially, not great but good, I am the sole bread winner of the family and my Wife wants to be a SAHM to which I support. I think it's a bit unessicary to spend that much money on something we will only use for 6 years, maybe 8 years max. Especially if we are only having one. \n\nI tried explaining this to her, but that seemed to make her pissy for lack of better words. She told me I had no issue spending $400 on a carseat, which is true but the car seat is a necessity and honestly I am willing to spend big money on something that will ensure the softy of our child for 8 years. Now, this is where I think I am the AH. I told her we should look at strollers on the cheaper side. They look the same and as far as I can tell, they do the exact same. She told me the expensive ones were nicer and they were \"better\". I asked her to tell me what the $800 stroller can do, that the $300 can't do. She didn't say anything and so we left. it's been about a week and she still hasn't spoken to me even though I have tried to make amends. So, AITAH?\n\nEDIT:\n\nThanks so much for your advice and experience in the world of babies and strollers! It definitely helps me figure out what is best and what to avoid/expect.  If the kid is not going to be using it for as much as eight years, then I am definitely leaning towards something not so grand, but again we will see. \n\nI know most of you are asking about the relation ship my Wife and I have, and wether or not if she is going to be using it for walks, jogging, junking, etc. and I figured I might add a little more info so I don\u2019t have to scroll through so many comments:\n\n- My Wife and I are more on the hermit side. We prefer to stay in and rather just watch Netflix and hang out. When we do go out, it\u2019s usually to just meet with friends and family or a vacation. ( we both did agree on no big trips until the baby is older and can be more easily distracted, we both don\u2019t like the idea traveling with a child under the age of 1) \n\n-She has never been much of a jogger or athletic for that matter, not since college. Our neighborhood has access to a lot of bike trails, paved walkways, and local parks all within a short walk from each other. I know she likes to bike and I don\u2019t see anything wrong with buying a nice sturdy and hardy bike attachment or pull-basket thing? I have no idea what they are called. At first I thought she was setting high expectations for herself that she is gonna get out of her shell and do things but I\u2019m not so sure anymore\u2026\n\n-I have tried multiple times to talk to her about the stroller and looking at other options and sitting down together to research but she refuses or will change the subject about it. I don\u2019t think it is nessicary to spend big money on an object just because it \u201clooks nice\u201d I want to see and understand what makes it so nice. Part of me thinks it has to do with the neighborhood. We live in a nice area and I know all the SAHMs here have the nicest strollers and gadgets and what not so perhaps she is feeling a little embarrassed that she dosent have these materialistic things for the baby, but again I won\u2019t know until she talks to me and opens up\u2026\n\n- Finally the. Biggest question is the relationship with my wife. I have been very open and transparent with her and we have good communication with each other, up until now. I have been chalking it up to the hormones and the nerves of becoming a mom let alone a SAHM. We both have good careers but she insists she wants to be the one here all day. I will admit I am beginning to get annoyed, especially since this all has to do with a stroller, a stroller that she won\u2019t tell me what it is or explain to me. I\u2019d rather have her come to me with her points than for me to do my own research and decide no and close case or do it together so she can explain it to me.", "created_utc": 1679445671, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11y0xxa/aita_for_not_wanting_to_spend_500_on_a_baby/", "score": 253, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve had a kid in a car seat but I\u2019m a bit skeptical of this, especially since the typical car seat has a  six-year expiration date.", "NTA for asking for her reasoning. That said, if you are going to jog or run with baby / toddler or at going to regularly use the stroller going out over the next 5 years, definitely go with a nice one. It saves money in the long run.", "Not sure on the judgement, because honestly it depends on what you actually *said* to each other.\n\nFirst I want to address the \"something we will only use for 6 years\" comment... That's $83 per year, under $7 per month... and a stroller *is* a necessity. Do I think $500 is necessary? Depends. \n\nIf you live in an area without many sidewalks, you're going to want a stroller with extra sturdy supports, axles, and *big* wheels.\n\nIf you live in a metro area, or you'll be going into lots of shops with the stroller, you'll probably want a jogger.\n\nIf you have 2 cars, you'll likely want to keep a car seat in each (and if you've only one car, and the car seat is *in* the car, you'll need a second one so your wife won't be trapped at home!) ... so you will probably want a convertible stroller, which comes *with* a carseat. That means the extra $400 you'd spend on a new car seat is part of that stroller cost.\n\nYou'll want a fairly large basket space underneath the stroller, because babies... and even more so, toddlers, accumulate things.\n\nIf your wife goes out a lot or is fairly active, she's likely to take baby out often, and it can be useful for the stroller to have a decent tray, both for the child, and for the parent!\n\nIn *any* case, you're going to want good sun protection. Most strollers come with a little canopy, but if you live somewhere extremely sunny, or conversely, with lots of inclement weather, you'll probably want one which can completely shield your little one.\n\n\nSome strollers can also convert to be front or back facing, like [this](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTAGluyG5H3l6HerxCxkoEZjPExU2H7SnM9zdxYWq-feL9XXj5N4J7s9luQi9ykQNlCQZLl2-5KlAsNkq2rT250nVorLyHopR1MmQwLhXtxdzg58054jJiEtw), which can be helpful if your wife is either very short or very tall... your arms get *hella* sore.\n\nMost strollers have at least a 3 point harness, but some only have a lap belt, which is not safe for younger babies. \n\nSome strollers have a back which barely reclines, or which doesn't sit up all the way. \n\nSome strollers are literally hell to fold. And a really cheap (quality, not price) stroller might fold when you don't want it to. \n\nThere's a lot that goes into the decision. $500 isn't unreasonable. $300 isn't cheaping out. It *entirely* depends on what you need from a stroller.\n\nIf your wife was looking at more expensive strollers because they have the features she needs... that's appropriate.\n\nIf you were setting a price ceiling because you genuinely can't afford it... that's appropriate.\n\nIf you talked about it like adults, if:\n\n>They look the same and as far as I can tell, they do the exact same.\n\nand\n\n> I asked her to tell me what the $800 stroller can do, that the $300 can't do.\n\nwere said in a reasonable tone, out of genuine desire for more information, and \n\n>She told me the expensive ones were nicer and they were \"better\".\n\nwas a genuine effort to show you that baby's needs matter, then... no assholes here.\n\nIf however, she was just brushing you off because she wanted a fancy stroller for pinterest, whether or not you can afford it... she's an AH\n\nIf your tone was full of doubt or derision, or just over-confidence that *none* of the pricier strollers could be \"better\" as she said, then you're an AH.\n\nUnless you're going to default to a cheap (price, and quality) $20 umbrella stroller, then you need to talk about all the pros and cons, her *needs* as the person who will be using the stroller, and what's actually feasible with the *household* budget. \n\nFor now, I'm going to assume you both had the best of intentions, and go with NAH.", "I'd want to hear your wife's actual reasons for liking the more expensive stroller. But you should listen. A stroller is absolutely a necessity\u2014how do you think you and she are going to get around places with your baby in tow? \n\nI don't know enough about the price ranges on these, but I do know that there might be a huge difference in maneuverability, ease of use, etc. If she's going to be using it on her own more than you are, then she should have something that works well and is easy to use.", "A stroller lasts for 3-4 years so it actually is a good ROI if you can afford it. You can ask her to present some evidence and go check them out to compare. NTA for asking for further evidence but be ready to be convinced.", "NTA. I had a $100 stroller and used it less than the $25 umbrella strollers I bought to keep in the trunk. \n\nThe only expensive strollers that might be worth it are ones that fold up small and are extra light for taking on mass transit.", "Oh dear, you are in for a massive shock on the cost of raising children.\n\nI am going to ESH. Sounds like you both need to get on the same page about finances and what you can afford - perhaps a better second hand pram is the middle ground.\n\nAs someone who has used shit prams, the better ones are absolutely worth the reliability and money. You see parents struggling to collapse a pram to put in the car, or being unable to go on certain surfaces in a park all the time. As for cost. Maybe I am used to exorbitant prices, but $800 for something that will be used 365 days a year for the next 8 years (assuming multiple children) sounds like great value - FYI the cheap pram isnt lasting 8 years.", "ESH \n\nA baby stroller will become a necessity once the baby is born and she/y\u2019all begin taking the baby out. I would say not to look at the price, but the quality of the strollers, really research them, the reviews, and post the question in groups with parents (Facebook) about what other parents recommend. There are so many different strollers out there now that have features that make going out with a baby more convenient. \n\nAlso you can keep items like that and hand them down to someone else in the family after you\u2019re done using them or pass them down to your kids way in the future because just like you\u2019re experiencing baby stuff is expensive for the quality/convenient items.", "I had three strollers. \n\nTwo were second-hand and one I brought at the shops. I spent $150 on the third one. It was a good brand and a few years old at the time. It was a great pram, easy to get parts (had to replace front wheel, buy a rain cover and tray). It was the best $150 I'd spent on my child. If I ever have another child, I'd buy the same pram either second hand or outright.", "Nta, but you both need to do more research.  You do want to make sure the stroller is sturdy and will roll easily. You don't want your baby being thrown around because it doesn't roll well.  You do want a stroller because the alternative is to carry the baby everywhere,  and the stroller will also carry all the other items you need - bottles,  diapers,  extra clothes,  the list goes on. \n\nHow important is it to you to be able to carry all the things you need to care for the baby when you go out?", "Depending on the stroller you will get YEARS out of it. My wife and I have a newborn and our expensive car seat/stroller combo gave us his car seat and stroller with a bassinet that will fit my son till he\u2019s probably 5 or 6", "NTA. Graco all day!", ">I asked her to tell me what the $800 stroller can do, that the $300 can't do. \n\nI don't see anything wrong with you asking this. I also think that much money for a stroller is too much. Sure the more expensive one maybe has better materials, more accessories and side-functions, and better aftersales support but I don't think it should be worth that much for you to have something that will last you for years and work great for you and your baby's needs.\n\nI'm going with NTA for now.\n\nMaybe this is something much deeper than just the stroller, as to why your wife is upset. Not sure if it's the hormones too. I hope she talks to you soon enough so that you can both get this fixed.\n\nedit:\n\nI'd also like to add that strollers would usually be a necessity by around until 3 years.", "I had a crappy stroller (the umbrella one) in the beginning because my ex was cheap too. It hurt my back and my forearms to push my baby around it, it rattled, it sucked. I upgraded to a baby yoyo zen2 ($400 ish) for traveling but I splurged on a Bugaboo ($800) on sale and that baby was a fucking cadillac. It was super nice and my kid would refer to it as the \"big poussette\" and refuse the babyzen. It was really nice to have great sun protection, a canopy he would pull down, recline flat to nap in comfortably and reverse so the baby could face you, etc. It also has great resale value. \n\nFor a newborn I would definitely get the Doona now. They sleep in the car seat so you really want to wake up the sleeping baby everytime you get in and out of the car when you can just transfer the carseat into a stroller?\nYou discount how often you want to be out and about and taking your baby for daily walks is really important so they get fresh air.\n\n It's like I was also shamed into buying a cheap one and he had to pay for it later when the cheap one broke apart and killed my back/shoulders/arms etc. Carrying a baby will also kill your back after you just gave birth. It's an investment that you don't want to cheap out on, but plenty of people also get a stroller for less than $300. I know you can get a jogger that will grow with your kid, but I feel bad for kids in $20 umbrella strollers, it does not look comfortable at all as they feel every bump and pebble. I also fail to see how it's any less important than a carseat as they will probably spend more time in the stroller considering how active you and your wife are. I think it's an important purchase, but everyone has varying degrees of money they are willing to spend. I wish I had gotten a quality one in the beginning though.\n\nAs you can see I had a bit of an obsession with strollers with my newborn. There are different strollers to get at different stages too. Like the babyzen I would get when they're past 2, as it's more for toddlers in cities or if you get on a plane it's light. The Bugaboo was so obnoxiously huge, but I loved it so much and so did my kid. They both had baby bassinets, but different ones are better for different stages. I wish I had gotten the Doona when he was a newborn.", "NTA. It sounds like you were trying to analyze the costs and benefits logically and she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. She just wanted to buy the one she wanted without thinking much about it.

Congrats to you both on your baby btw!", "NTA. Your point is valid.\n\nThe fact that she\u2019s been giving you the silent treatment for *a week* over this (or anything, really) is concerning.

Also since you have a carseat, pick the cheapest stroller that has a carseat adapter", "NTA Babies are expensive and there has to be some give on want versus need. We also were all about the higher quality car seat for safety reasons, but got our high chair, swing and play center second hand from a friend. They were save an did the job. The stroller was new, but was mid-range. The only concession you might make is if she is a runner and needs that type of stroller for running with baby, but otherwise a decent mid-range will be safe and do the trick.", "NAH. What you think you need before the kid comes is entirely different from what the kid ends up using over and over.\n\nDo some research and come up with stroller features you think you like, and then once you both agree on a model, either put it on your registry or wait for sales to buy it.

I will speculate that your wife has a friend or friends with the $800 one.", "NAH but some thoughts and questions based on some of your statements. I\u2019m not pro or against $800 stroller without seeing what it is and reasoning and comparable options. \n\n1. Your wife will be a SAHM and therefore likely be the primary user. What are her reasons for wanting this particular stroller? Is it easier for her to handle on her own, lighter, aged up with the child etc. You said she wasn\u2019t able to give reasoning before but it\u2019s possible she got flustered. \n\n2. You said a car seat is a necessity but not a stroller and I disagree, how will the child navigate the world outside of the car? How will mom go grocery shopping, grab coffee, or go to the park without the baby if not with a stroller? \n\n3. Can you find the expensive stroller on a resell site like Facebook marketplace?", "NAH, but you need to talk about this.\n\nKids will outgrow things fast, including strollers. I can't remember exactly but I don't think I used mine for either kid past the age of four. Car seats are different, at least in my mind. You'll use them longer, kids do need to be in them for several years, and they need to keep your kid safe in a moving vehicle. \n\nI doubt your wife will be able to answer why she wants an $800 stroller. But perhaps the two of you could investigate strollers. I don't know how often you'll use it or under what circumstances. If you live in a city, you might want something different than if you live in the suburbs.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nAlso you're not gonna use the same stroller for 6-8 years, that's ridiculous.", "NTA.

You are only getting 3-4 years out that. Like $20-25 / month for years just for *that* stroller.\n\nIf she\u2019s going to be a SAHM (and I have been one) you both should be on the same page re: what\u2019s being spent.

It would have been \\~\u00a3800 new, we got it for <\u00a3200. It lasted us for 2 children but neither of them were in it for more than 2 years each. \n\nThis was a big pram that was safe and comfortable for them. \n\nHowever, when our second child was 2 we got a cheap (but still good quality) lightweight pushchair as she was walking most of the time and didn't need the security or comfort of the big one.", "NAH\n\nThe very best advice I got was: don\u2019t buy everything now. Get the basics. Car seat, safe sleeping space. Small supply of diapers and clothing. Have a plan for feeding (and a back up plan). You will figure out what works best as you learn how to parent and what specific needs your child has.", "NAH. It\u2019s hard to know what you\u2019ll need beforehand. I got a single use out of my stroller because my baby wanted to be close all of the time. Luckily I had gotten a cheaper one and distributed the money I would have spent to buy some other things like wraps and carriers. There are some things that it\u2019s worth it to spend a little more (like the car seat, as you mentioned). I also really like the concept of the newton mattresses. It always made me feel better in those early days because mine rolled pretty early. Congratulations to you and your wife!", "NTA.

A good stroller is absolutely worth the investment.", "So your contribution to the necessities of the baby has been zero (she picked the car seat and you don't even know why, she's gathering info on parenting groups and you don't participate) and on top of that you blame her and dismiss her work on top of that.

And if you're one of the few people who will get their monies worth out of an expensive stroller because you use it often and it suits your lifestyle then absolutely, it makes sense. But the better majority of people don't use a stroller on a daily basis. And if they do, they often end up using an umbrella stroller more often than their larger, more cumbersome stroller.\n\nAnd yes, having one that is convertible from infant thru 65 lbs is the best way to go! Honestly, neither of my nieces used their strollers much. And the strollers we did use for them most often ended up being the umbrella stroller. My dad ended up taking my niece on nightly walks after dinner as his form of exercise, and it was a cute bonding experience where they got to spend one on one time together. My other niece, her sister, rarely ever used any kind of stroller. She's always been too much of a \"busy body\" and never stayed in one for very long.\n\nMaybe they could opt for a less expensive but still nice, comfortable stroller and see how the kid does with it. If it seems that they'll use it quite often then they could sell the original one and invest in a better one. That way they aren't out almost a grand, only to find out that their kid despises being in a stroller.", "If your kid is still in a stroller in four years, let alone six, there's something wrong.

My lad was in a pram for a year tops (that didnt convert), then went into a forward facing buggy and was out of that by three maybe four tops. No six year old will need to be in a buggy unless there are mobility issues so you are really only planning on spending something for 3 years tops. The price isnt the important thing, its the practicality and how it will fit into your life. No point spending a fortune on a buggy if you cant take it off road and thats where you go for most of your walks.

Get something cheap that will do until you work out what you actually need.", "YTA. First off- the stroller won\u2019t be used anywhere near 6-8 years unless you have multiple children. However that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t invest in a high quality stroller\u2014 particularly if you plan on using it a lot. I used the uppababy Cruz for both my kids and I\u2019m so glad we spent the money on something durable, light and easy to use. Yes it\u2019s more or less all the same for the baby. The only person you spite with a cheap stroller is yourself \u2014 cause you will be the one wrestling with it. \n\nAs for a car seat, you might have bought one of those infinitely adjustable birth to 12 seats but the odds that it won\u2019t be destroyed do to spills, accidents and crumbs after the first couple of years is very low.

When my child outgrew it I wanted to get a small, foldable umbrella style stroller. It was around $200. Going from the Doona to that I was immediately aggravated. There is a reason expensive stroller are expensive. The less expensive stroller doesn\u2019t push or turn well, the angle of seat is wrong so my child is never in a good position. It couldn\u2019t handle anything other then really flat flooring surfaces. \n\nWe don\u2019t use a stroller a lot for normal life things. I want my child to walk, and if I go shopping I put my toddler in the shopping cart seat. But you do need them if you want to go anywhere that requires walking for a length of time. Like sightseeing, the zoo, theme parks. Your toddler won\u2019t be able to walk the entire time and they get heavy fast when carrying. We got a $500 wagon stroller and it\u2019s worth every penny. \n\nYou seem very dismissive of your wife, minimizing why she could want or need the more expensive stroller but seemingly have done no research on your own. I doubt the silent treatment is purely about the stroller. You should apologize. If you can afford it, buy the more expensive stroller.

If you shop a consignment store or review surf, you can find cheaper alternatives that are just as good.\n\nMy husband and I got a $250 stroller from Amazon, and it has been great for over 2 years. The only repair we had to do was to change the tires because we used it so much the rubber tires actually went bald.  I am pregnant with my second kid and will use the same stroller for him.  We also just upgraded to a stroller wagon for my 2.5 year old because he was outgrowing the stroller. He loves it, and we  went with one that was also about $250, not some of the insanely priced variations. It works great.  Just because something is expensive, it doesn't automatically make it better. I would say avoid super, super cheap because those probably do suck, but you don't have to go super high end either.\n\nA lot of people on here have said that they don't use strollers much, but it really depends on the family. I took my first child on 5+ mile walks as a smaller baby regularly, and then every single day once he was older we took smaller walks (maybe 1 mile and then a trip to a park) when he lost some attention span for it.  Strollers are also great for zoos, museums, and other places where the kid won't be able to walk the entire time without a major issue.", "NTA. But are you  sure the $500 wasn't a travel system?

It\u2019s a lifeline; with a new baby, walks are incredibly important to mental health. \n\nShe wants the $800 one, you want the $300, get the $500 one and really think about how something like a stroller will impact her quality of life. \n\nYou\u2019ll use the stroller hopefully for a single child for like 3 years max.

I have plenty of money and still bought all the big ticket items used because why not save money. The car seat is important for safety though, so we did make a new one a group gift option for our baby shower.", "NTA but you guys need to do more research. As lots of people have been saying, car seats expire. Even if you get a convertible one that goes from rear to front-facing, you will only get 6 years out of it. Your child will then need a booster seat until maybe 8, although it depends on how big your kid is. Mine is on the very small side so she\u2019ll probably be in a booster seat until she\u2019s 18 (kidding, sort of, lol - she\u2019s just so tiny!). \n\nLook for a used stroller of the model your wife likes, or I would suggest using an inexpensive car seat stroller frame until your child is old enough for a larger standard stroller (about 1 year old). You can likely find one to fit your car seat used for cheap or free. There\u2019s a nice jogging stroller I got on Amazon for $120 in 2019 (looks like it\u2019s $143 now) and that thing rules. It has everything we need and folds up easily. I don\u2019t know what the rules are here for posting product links so DM me if you want the link I guess. Anyway it\u2019s a great stroller and has held up well. \n\nKids are expensive AF and you have no idea whether your child will need more expensive levels of care than you anticipate.

Try to save money where you can. If your child doesn\u2019t end up requiring any expensive care, set that money aside that you would have spent on expensive strollers and clothes and toys and chuck it in a 529 for their education. Can be used for private grade school, high school, or college (I think trade school also). \n\nIt\u2019s important that you and your wife have quality items for your child that keep your child safe and make your lives easier but if you can get what you need without paying sky high retail prices, I would try to do that.\n\nIf you are on Facebook there is the option of Marketplace, and there are also Buy Nothing groups that I certainly have made use of to both give and receive items without any exchange of money. Theres also an online consignment market called Good Buy Gear for parents to sell/buy used baby/toddler items. So you might check that out.", "NTA Get a used stroller. There is absolutely no need to spend that much money on a stroller. I got a cheap used one for my kids and hardly used it because I found wearing my baby more convenient and easier. I ended up selling it for what I bought it for.", "NTA. I have had plenty of usage out of my cheaper end strollers. I had one for regular days, and one lightweight for travel and such. Neither were close to 800 TOGETHER, and my babies were carted around just fine. You do not need a super expensive stroller. Also, unless you plan on having more children, strollers will be used MAYBE 3-4 years on average.", "NAH\n\nWhen it comes to strollers, you want versatility. It should be compatible with the car seat during infancy and you should be able to use it well into the toddler years, and beyond depending, on the kid. Some love strollers and will happily sit for hours, and some kids decide to start walking at 10 months. If you plan on having kids close together, some strollers come with add-ons, like a scooter or standing platform for the big kid.\n\nSome strollers fold up with just one yank of a strap and some are harder than a Rubik\u2019s cube. Be sure to test them by opening and closing them in the store, practicing with both hands and just one hand. The same goes for steering.

I don't think either one of you is really prepared and you both could REALLY benefit from parenting classes. You won't need/use most things people get when having kids. I'm a mom of two and as many other commenters have said, you won't really be using the stroller for more than 4 years; 6 is if you're feeling nice or your kid needs a little extra time getting to where they should be developmentally - my son took a little longer than his sister to hit milestones like crawling, walking, talking, etc. It happens. Honestly a $20-40 stroller would be fine; maybe a bit more of a hassle because you have to actually carry some things but they're still just as safe and efficient as the \"better\" strollers. Same with the car seat - unless you have a transitioning one that changes into the appropriate seat as your child grows, you would actually be replacing the car seat to a booster seat between 2-4 years; depending on where you're at as each state has its own laws regarding car seats. \n\nAlso, I get that your wife is pregnant, but it was pretty childish and immature of her to basically stomp her feet and out like a child when she couldn't get the $800 stroller. Like I'm sorry but pregnancy doesn't give you a free pass to be entitled and bratty. Kids are expensive and if she wants to be a SAHM - I am one and have been the entirety of my kids lives; my kids are a 10f & 9m. It's not as fun as one might think; nor is it as cheap as most people assume either - she needs to understand that you most likely won't be able to afford \"all the nice things other moms have.\"  It's going to be VERY different and more financially strapped than what either of you are used to. And honestly, after seeing your edits I think your wife REALLY needs to talk to a therapist ASAP. You both may be \"hermits\" but you're about to have a child and they will eventually be going out into the world.

NTA\n\np.s I understand your wife's excitement but better you sock that \u00a3 away, esp if she wants to be a SAHM.", "My daughter was in her baby seat until she was 18months (she was small - normally outgrown by 12 months). She was then in an extended rear facing seat until she was 5.5years old and she is now in a booster seat until she is at least 12. So they are in car seats a long time. And they are all as expensive as each other.", "I don't have kids but this falls into the category of \"things between you and the ground\" which are usually the places to get the best you can - mattresses, shoes, etc. *And* in the \"if this things breaks I'm fucked\" category. If you're about to rush out the door to something and the stroller falls apart, that's gonna suck. \n\nSo, yeah, I definitely agree with you. \n\nI think OP isn't thinking about ergonomics or reliability, just \"it's a thing to put baby in instead of arms.\" Hell, my parents hated once I was too big for the stroller because it was a handy way to cart things around at parks/malls/whatever. I distinctly remember getting a ride on my dad's shoulders while the stroller held items that could not cling onto another person. \n\nWhen my friend lived in Manhattan during her husband's medical residency, she struggled finding a proper stroller that was easy enough to bring on public transport (and carry up walkups) but also sturdy enough and well designed enough for long Central Park walks.", "What did OP do/say that gets him anywhere remotely near the level of an AH? Just because he doesn't have the same perspective as on prams as you? \n\nIgnoring the fact that there are still very good ones at lower price points, OP's wife didn't even find all those extra features important (even if they would help down the road) based on her not being able to even say what the difference between the $800 one and the $300 one: \n\n>They look the same and as far as I can tell, they do the exact same. She told me the expensive ones were nicer and they were \"better\". I asked her to tell me what the $800 stroller can do, that the $300 can't do. She didn't say anything and so we left.\n\nSo there's an extremely good chance she was simply wanting one that *looked* nicer and equated spending more with better without knowing really any details about the more expensive one. And you think OP is an AH for not supporting that? That seems absurd. They're both unaware and need to do research, but at least he has some rationale behind his thinking.", "To me it just looks nice and fancy, but I don\u2019t see the difference in the others. Like I mentioned in someone else\u2019s post, she and I have never really gone out much before and after we dated and married. So part of me thinks she is setting these expectations for herself that she is gonna do more and go out which is fine and all I don\u2019t care. But as far as I can tell (because she won\u2019t bring up points or talk to me on why her choice is best) it looks aesthetically pleasing.", "My older child didn't want a thing to do with the stroller as soon as she could walk (she was under a year old) and once my younger child came along, it was more convenient to wear him so I had hands free for wrangling the toddler. When I sold it, it was in close to mint condition. Hardly worth even having it. If you live in a place where you'll be doing a lot of walking, it makes sense to get a stroller that's nice and easy to push around, but $800 is insane.", "At that age, if they still need to be strolled around it would most likely be due to disability, and they'd need a specialised stroller for their age, weight, and physical needs.", "\u2026\u2026.who uses a stroller 365 days a year?!! Lol parents who do daily walks and outings. What the heck lol I use mine multiple times a day every. Single. Day.", "Have you acknowledged to her that you maybe should\u2019ve taken a bit more interest in this stuff?", "I was referencing how OP was only planning on having one child and I don't have children but I know that you don't put a child in the same stroller for 6-8 years. Didn't specify it in my reply tho so thanks for adding!", "I am aware that you can use a stroller for more than one child thus prolonging the time it is in use. What I meant was that, since op only plans on having one child, they will not get six-8 years of use out of it. Since I don't reference this is my reply I can see how it may be misleading tho, so thank you for clarifying :)", "Just want to add this: We\u2019re financially secure but our kids were mainly second hand kids just because we don\u2019t see the point in spending a ton of money on stuff that only gets uswd for a very short time. Kids grow so fast during the first years that nothing really gets used.\n\nEspecially the baby stuff is often in pristine condition and good brands are so durable that there are no issues with second hand options. Not sure what good brands in the US are but strollers etc. from Buggaboo, Emmaljunga etc. are good for many kids.\n\nNot sure if this argument might work: It only saves a ton of money it\u2019s also much better for the environment and considering that your kids will live in this world much longer than you and her this might be something to think about.\n\nWe got our stroller second hand from friends after two kids, used it for our two and gave it to friends who are using it for their second kid now. I think they replaced a wheel once. Brand was Bugaboo. So things are bulletproof.", "Unless maybe they are thinking of 2-3 kids back to back\u2026.though he is also expecting the car seat to last that long\u2026unless they have now came up with one from birth - 8 years now I remember I went through 3 of them since we needed different kinds he went in to the booster seat.", "Don\u2019t you swap out at various times for different car seats? Infant car seats don\u2019t have much in common with booster seats that older kids sit in.", "Yeah, my cousin had one of those for a while. It definitely wasn\u2019t the same one he had as a baby. She would have been shoving it along like Fred Flintstone\u2019s car.", "Yeah this made me laugh really hard. It\u2019s a very rare day ours doesn\u2019t get used.", "Yeah I have one of those that you remove/add parts and can use from birth to 7/8 booster. I didn\u2019t buy ours since birth though. \nBut he says he\u2019s only having one kid. I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s been all his life but I\u2019ve never seen a 7 year old in a stroller, unless the child has special needs of course.", "Infant mode: often has an insert, and you position it facing the back of the car & reclined.\n\nWhen they're older, you turn it around and strap it upright. And a lot of them are convertible so you can take the back piece off and use the seat as a booster.\n\nThat said, we chose not to buy the 0-8 car seat because if you're in a car accident you have to throw it out and poof, there goes the extra years you paid. We hired one, and it got destroyed by broken glass due to a freak hail storm.\n\nIIRC my husband also did a lot of research and convertible seats aren't as safe.", "There are so many gently used baby things on Facebook market place and things like that"]}
