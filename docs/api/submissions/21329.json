The reason being that a couple years ago she got in an accident that led to her needing medical supervision. She has a service dog but I feel better being close to her so I can help look after her. And it\u2019s not like I mooch off of her, I pay rent and help out with groceries and other expenses. \n\nOne of my coworkers I\u2019m not to close to but go to the same church as found out about my living situation. He decided to confront me at work the next day. In front of a couple other coworkers he said \u201chey op you still live with your mom?\u201d I simply replied yes. After that he  went on saying he could never do that and needs his own freedom. He then talked about how when he was my age he got his own place and how it truly made him feel like an adult as well as saying I\u2019ll never grow up living with her. Now I didn\u2019t need to worry about the opinions of the other coworkers there because they happened to be close friends of mine and knew why I lived with her. But I still felt like I needed to say something so I replied \u201cwell your mother didn\u2019t get into a horrible accident resulting in her needing constant medical attention.\u201d He went Oh\u2026 well that\u2019s different then and walked off. \n\nI thought that was the end of it but later I got an email from him saying there was no need to embarrass him in front of everyone and I could have explained my situation to him later or not have said anything at all. He said he was just explaining his experience and giving advice and had no intention of humiliating me whereas I replied with the sole intention of humiliating him. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t believe his comments weren\u2019t meant to hurt me he was correct in saying that I only responded to get back at him.

He needs to grow up, lol", "NTA. He has zero social awareness if he thinks he was \u201conly giving advice and explaining his situation\u201d and that his comments wouldn\u2019t be embarrassing. You never asked for advice. He was out of line and you responded with facts to defend yourself not to get back at him.", "NTA. \n\nHe was trying to humiliate you and you gave the answer he deserved. He's embarrassed that he looks like an asshole now, but well... that's what happens when you're asshole! If he didn't want to be seen in a bad light, he should have been kinder.", "NTA. What a beautiful church attending soul that coworker of your has! He just wanted to help by humilating you in front of everyone and when he got the short end of the stick suddenly you should have been private about that info. He's just mad he got back his good will in his face.", "NTA, He's the dumb fuck that could have waited until you two were also alone. The audacity of some people.", "NTA. First of all you never asked for advice in the first place. Second, if that is really what he wanted he could've also made it so in private.\n\nAlso, what kind of advice is \"living alone will make you feel like an adult\"?", "NTA. The dude \u201cexplained his experience\u201d in a judgmental manner. Your response was fine.", "NTA. He wanted to make you feel bad and didn't like being pulled up on his shit behavior. He wants grace from you in private but wanted to put you down in public. He fully intended to humiliate you. Don't feel bad for a moment.", "NTA. Responding truthfully to someone\u2019s opinions with your own facts is entirely appropriate. It\u2019s not gaslighting and doesn\u2019t make you a narcissist. But keep the email and some notes about the situation since it happened at work. That way if it escalates you can involve HR.", "You're definitely NTA but he is.\nHe could've confronted you privately too.\nBut he chooses not to do that.\nYou were very nice to him i would've made sure to point out publicly that his comments were unnecessary and rude. \nYou didn't even embarrass him", "NTA, getting embarrassed like that is a risk you run when you judge and belittle others for their life choices when you know nothing about why they're making those choices.", "NTA.\n\nWell, he publicly shamed you.\n\nSo he gets a public reply...", "NTA. If he had earnest intentions, he would have approached you at church or some other non-work setting. He was attempting to weaponize a sliver of personal information in an effort to diminish you. You didn\u2019t mention his age, but he sounds immature as well as malicious. Keep the email.", "NTA    he shouldn't have brought it up in front of everyone if he wanted to have a private conversation", "NTA.   You stated why you live with your mom.  Simple fact.\n\nHe dug his own hole", "NTA.\n\nRespond to his email, copying the rest of the office in and say something like \"Sorry really didn't mean to embarrass you.  I hope we can be friends\" and watch the consequences", "NTA - He\u2019s just embarrassed and trying to put it on you.", "NTA\n\nWhy did he bring it up in front of other people if his intention was not to embarrass you? You\u2019re not the asshole for correcting him. If he really didn\u2019t want to embarrass you, he either would have talked to you one on one or said nothing at all.", "NTA\n\nHe is what is meant by the word asshole.  Your living situation is absolutely none of his business.  It is not his place to comment on anything outside job related issues.  You did not ask him for advice  and his condescending $1.99 speech had nothing but belittling intentions.  Good for you for giving him a taste of his own medicine.  Even if his intentions were good (which they weren't,) he did not extend you the courtesy of a 'private' conversation.  This assclown has a lot of nerve.", "Absolutely NTA. Do you believe his intention wasn\u2019t to shame/hurt you? Because he was trying to peacock, and make himself all big and proud and manly in front of your coworkers, and\u2026that didn\u2019t end well for him. It rarely ends well for AH\u2019s, which is what he was in that situation. You did just fine telling him of your situation when he was trying to belittle yours, which from the sounds of it is exactly what he was doing here. \n\nPeople who try to make make themselves look better (saying how when he was your age, he had moved out and gotten his own place) and belittle others who make different decisions (saying you\u2019ll never grow up living with your mother) aren\u2019t bigger or better, but are instead trying to mask their own smallness.", "NTA. I would recco having a sit down with HR and you and this guy so you can describe in detail what he said and how uncomfortable it made you felt.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
