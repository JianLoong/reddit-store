She\u2019s upset because she won\u2019t get pictures at the hospital to post on social media, which I\u2019ve already said I don\u2019t want any pictures online of my kids at all. \nShe has other grandkids so this is not her first, however it is my parents first grandchild. MIL uses her other grandkids as a photo op to make her estranged family jealous of her life on Instagram, but that\u2019s as far as her involvement actually goes. I moved from France to Canada for my job and chose to stay there, I love it here but I do wish it were my family here with me as my parents and grandparents are really involved people, call to ask about how I\u2019m doing every day etc. They\u2019re devastated that they won\u2019t be in the hospital and the last thing I want is my MIL posting pictures everywhere or showing hospital pics to my Mother and upsetting her, because she has been known to do that (she ruined our announcement while we were on the plane on the way to tell my family by texting my mum first).   \nI will likely have to have a c-section as both babies are big and these are my firsts, so my OB isn\u2019t keen on me delivering naturally, she thinks it\u2019s safer to schedule a csection and I will do whatever they think is best. Therefore I think it\u2019s even better that people don\u2019t come immediately as I\u2019m going to be a mess, there\u2019s two babies and it\u2019s just going to be a lot. \nMy partner (33M) is in full support of me and thinks it\u2019ll be good to have private bonding time and for everyone to come at once. Plus my parents will be staying in the basement apartment of our house like they always do when they visit, so would give my partner and myself a break to sleep for an hour or two etc during their trip which will be a godsend after a few days in hospital. \n\nMIL says I\u2019m preventing her from being a grandmother as I also refused a baby shower (in my culture it\u2019s bad luck to receive baby gifts until the babies are born, so a shower is seen as bad luck) and it\u2019s not fair that she won\u2019t get to meet them first, but I told her that she would be getting more than my parents, like more birthday parties, more time with kids etc purely because my parents are on a different continent. She cried last night at dinner in front of the whole family but we held firm. My parents already know about the c-section and are going to fly asap depending on the winter flights, but either way they\u2019ll be there within 3-4 days or birth and sooner if we get a c-section date as they can pre-plan their flights so it\u2019s not like MIL is going to be kept in the dark for months??? It\u2019s literally a couple of days! Everyone will get a picture of babies from the hospital and are welcome to come and meet them all at once. \nAITA?\n\n[Edit1: I\u2019m just adding that we have spoken to MIL about no pics, she said she wanted memories. We told her that if no pictures were taken we would be more open to her coming to the hospital, her response was that that would be nice and then she could call my Mum and give her an update. Our parents have a strained relationship already due to MIL ruining our pregnancy announcement, so would 100% see her calling with updates as her rubbing it in that they can\u2019t be there. I understand that I have made things hard by moving to another country, I\u2019m just trying to give both sides of the family fair access without one upsetting the other.\nMy partner is in full agreement and actually suggested making everyone wait a full week before anyone met babies, so he doesn\u2019t mind making them wait]", "created_utc": 1681043736, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gi8dm/aita_for_stopping_my_mil_meeting_my_newborn_until/", "score": 504, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How you're setting this up is going to led to conflict between your MIL and your parents, where they feel like they have to compete for \"favorite grandparent\" and who has more facetime. That's just not fair to the baby. You really should be focusing on each of them getting their own special introduction with the baby, no matter who gets there first.\n\n\nSounds like your more worried about her taking and posting pictures and in general issues with you and her relationship. So talk to her about that, don't link it to your parents visit. If you don't want her at the hospital that's fine, plan a special introduction for her at your house. Also, have you even talked to your parents about if they mind being sent pictures and updates by your MIL. There's always a chance they would like it, since they won't be able to be there for the moments. Despite a difficult relationship with me, my MIL is very close to my children and its very special she was able to met them at the hospital.

Seriously?  Life IS NOT FAIR. Life does NOT give ANY GUARANTEES.  \n\nPeople can see the baby on YOUR schedule, that is YOUR CALL as a parent.

The ONLY people allowed at the hospital or the baby for the first 6 weeks were the maternal grandparents.  Nobody pitched a fit. We dropped meals at their front door, texted to check in, received photos and face time calls because mom knew we respected her and wouldn\u2019t post online.

NTA protect your sanity and your bubs \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude01", "counterpoint: some families are *really* sensitive about that sort of thing and it can cause a LOT of drama. My parents got upset over who was told of our pregnancies first, they get upset about holiday equality, they throw fits about who we visit and when\u2026it\u2019s a THING. This honestly sounds reasonable in a situation like that \u2014 where the families are gonna get out the measuring tape for every. little. thing. It\u2019s *exhausting*, but sometimes this is the way to resolve things with the LEAST drama. \n\nOP, as a veteran of these jealous families-type conflicts, I\u2019d try something like this: \u201cWe know how excited you are to meet our twins, and we are *so* excited that both sets of grandparents will be able to have this special moment together. I know that it will be tough to wait, but since I\u2019ll be having a c-section with two babies, the doctors agree we should have a little time to ourselves with them so I can recover and DH and I can bond with our new ones. I know that you\u2019ll understand, especially since you live so near and you\u2019ll be experiencing so much of their lives first hand.\u201d\n\nA lot of the issue with these feelings is familial insecurity, which I am in no way implying you are responsible for or that you guys need to somehow fix that for them. But if you flatter and thank and make the insecure person feel less insecure in that simple way, it can help alleviate the behaviors in many cases, without you ever sacrificing boundaries. \n\nOH, also\u2026my advice? For the specific hospital visit, don\u2019t push the photos thing at this moment. That feels like it\u2019s going to be a whole separate ongoing struggle, and adding it in when the initial visit is the focus would just further put MIL on the defensive, and it\u2019s not worth litigating that at the same time. Just make sure she doesn\u2019t take photos on that initial visit, but for the love of all things holy, *DO NOT* let your parents take photos while she is in the room, TELL THEM that they cannot *talk* about taking photos of the babies with MIL there. If you did, that would make you the asshole in that instance, imo.\n\n(Also, maybe consider allowing photos as long as the baby\u2019s face isn\u2019t showing? Because not allowing any online photos of the kids is a pretty tall order, and if privacy is the concern, that should help? I\u2019m not telling you that you can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t make the photo restrictions \u2014 that\u2019s between you and your husband \u2014 I just think maybe it\u2019s more feasible to ask of this MIL. She\u2019ll sneak photos at some point, and if you\u2019ve given her an option where she can both follow your rules and post about her new grandchildren\u2026it\u2019s more likely to stick.)\n\nOP, this is gonna be a thing for the rest of your child\u2019s life, so absolutely start setting boundaries like this now. You guys making your (entirely reasonable, under the circumstances) wishes clear now may initially put you in her bad books, but as long as your husband is the one leading the discussion(s) with his mother, as long as you empathize with her perspective but hold firm to your bright lines, it will hopefully be manageable. \n\ngood luck!", "What did they expect when they set up a life thousands of miles away from their parents?", "Couldn\u2019t agree more", "You're missing the part where the world DOES NOT REVOLVE AROUND THE MIL!

Otherwise, small boundaries would send us all into anarchy! MIL needs to grow up. It's not about her. She needs to respect the parents wishes, period. She's not entitled to time with her new grandchild at her own convenience. She needs to respect the parents wishes and be grateful and look forward to the time she will get to spend with her new grandchild. MIL doesn't need more people enabling and supporting her sense of entitlement. She threw a tantrum and cried in front of everybody about it ffs... she needs more boundaries, not less.", "MIL has a history of ignoring boundaries.  Also, OP knows exactly what MIL will do because MIL told her:\n\n> I\u2019m just adding that we have spoken to MIL about no pics, she said she wanted memories. We told her that if no pictures were taken we would be more open to her coming to the hospital, her response was that that would be nice and then she could call my Mum and give her an update. Our parents have a strained relationship already due to MIL ruining our pregnancy announcement, so would 100% see her calling with updates as her rubbing it in that they can\u2019t be there.\n\nEven if MIL agrees to no pics she's likely to take them in secret and plaster them all over social media in opposition to OP's and partners's wishes.
