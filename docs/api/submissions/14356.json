She\u2019s upset because she won\u2019t get pictures at the hospital to post on social media, which I\u2019ve already said I don\u2019t want any pictures online of my kids at all. \nShe has other grandkids so this is not her first, however it is my parents first grandchild. MIL uses her other grandkids as a photo op to make her estranged family jealous of her life on Instagram, but that\u2019s as far as her involvement actually goes. I moved from France to Canada for my job and chose to stay there, I love it here but I do wish it were my family here with me as my parents and grandparents are really involved people, call to ask about how I\u2019m doing every day etc. They\u2019re devastated that they won\u2019t be in the hospital and the last thing I want is my MIL posting pictures everywhere or showing hospital pics to my Mother and upsetting her, because she has been known to do that (she ruined our announcement while we were on the plane on the way to tell my family by texting my mum first).   \nI will likely have to have a c-section as both babies are big and these are my firsts, so my OB isn\u2019t keen on me delivering naturally, she thinks it\u2019s safer to schedule a csection and I will do whatever they think is best. Therefore I think it\u2019s even better that people don\u2019t come immediately as I\u2019m going to be a mess, there\u2019s two babies and it\u2019s just going to be a lot. \nMy partner (33M) is in full support of me and thinks it\u2019ll be good to have private bonding time and for everyone to come at once. Plus my parents will be staying in the basement apartment of our house like they always do when they visit, so would give my partner and myself a break to sleep for an hour or two etc during their trip which will be a godsend after a few days in hospital. \n\nMIL says I\u2019m preventing her from being a grandmother as I also refused a baby shower (in my culture it\u2019s bad luck to receive baby gifts until the babies are born, so a shower is seen as bad luck) and it\u2019s not fair that she won\u2019t get to meet them first, but I told her that she would be getting more than my parents, like more birthday parties, more time with kids etc purely because my parents are on a different continent. She cried last night at dinner in front of the whole family but we held firm. My parents already know about the c-section and are going to fly asap depending on the winter flights, but either way they\u2019ll be there within 3-4 days or birth and sooner if we get a c-section date as they can pre-plan their flights so it\u2019s not like MIL is going to be kept in the dark for months??? It\u2019s literally a couple of days! Everyone will get a picture of babies from the hospital and are welcome to come and meet them all at once. \nAITA?\n\n[Edit1: I\u2019m just adding that we have spoken to MIL about no pics, she said she wanted memories. We told her that if no pictures were taken we would be more open to her coming to the hospital, her response was that that would be nice and then she could call my Mum and give her an update. Our parents have a strained relationship already due to MIL ruining our pregnancy announcement, so would 100% see her calling with updates as her rubbing it in that they can\u2019t be there. I understand that I have made things hard by moving to another country, I\u2019m just trying to give both sides of the family fair access without one upsetting the other.\nMy partner is in full agreement and actually suggested making everyone wait a full week before anyone met babies, so he doesn\u2019t mind making them wait]", "created_utc": 1681043736, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gi8dm/aita_for_stopping_my_mil_meeting_my_newborn_until/", "score": 2821, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, this is the babies grandmother and you shouldn't be setting her up as a comparison to your parents, they should be independent relationships. How you're setting this up is going to led to conflict between your MIL and your parents, where they feel like they have to compete for \"favorite grandparent\" and who has more facetime. That's just not fair to the baby. You really should be focusing on each of them getting their own special introduction with the baby, no matter who gets there first.\n\n\nSounds like your more worried about her taking and posting pictures and in general issues with you and her relationship. So talk to her about that, don't link it to your parents visit. If you don't want her at the hospital that's fine, plan a special introduction for her at your house. Also, have you even talked to your parents about if they mind being sent pictures and updates by your MIL. There's always a chance they would like it, since they won't be able to be there for the moments. Despite a difficult relationship with me, my MIL is very close to my children and its very special she was able to met them at the hospital.

I got here first!\" just to rub it in OP's parents' faces.", "Right and if it is a c section likely since it\u2019s large twins\u2026they will know the date a few days in advance so her parents may be there anyway.

Universal no visitors till mum and bubs are home, settled and ready for a visit. Let hospital staff know! NTA protect your sanity and your bubs \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude01", "counterpoint: some families are *really* sensitive about that sort of thing and it can cause a LOT of drama. My parents got upset over who was told of our pregnancies first, they get upset about holiday equality, they throw fits about who we visit and when\u2026it\u2019s a THING. This honestly sounds reasonable in a situation like that \u2014 where the families are gonna get out the measuring tape for every. little. thing. It\u2019s *exhausting*, but sometimes this is the way to resolve things with the LEAST drama. \n\nOP, as a veteran of these jealous families-type conflicts, I\u2019d try something like this: \u201cWe know how excited you are to meet our twins, and we are *so* excited that both sets of grandparents will be able to have this special moment together. I know that it will be tough to wait, but since I\u2019ll be having a c-section with two babies, the doctors agree we should have a little time to ourselves with them so I can recover and DH and I can bond with our new ones. I know that you\u2019ll understand, especially since you live so near and you\u2019ll be experiencing so much of their lives first hand.\u201d\n\nA lot of the issue with these feelings is familial insecurity, which I am in no way implying you are responsible for or that you guys need to somehow fix that for them. But if you flatter and thank and make the insecure person feel less insecure in that simple way, it can help alleviate the behaviors in many cases, without you ever sacrificing boundaries. \n\nOH, also\u2026my advice? For the specific hospital visit, don\u2019t push the photos thing at this moment. That feels like it\u2019s going to be a whole separate ongoing struggle, and adding it in when the initial visit is the focus would just further put MIL on the defensive, and it\u2019s not worth litigating that at the same time. Just make sure she doesn\u2019t take photos on that initial visit, but for the love of all things holy, *DO NOT* let your parents take photos while she is in the room, TELL THEM that they cannot *talk* about taking photos of the babies with MIL there. If you did, that would make you the asshole in that instance, imo.\n\n(Also, maybe consider allowing photos as long as the baby\u2019s face isn\u2019t showing? Because not allowing any online photos of the kids is a pretty tall order, and if privacy is the concern, that should help? I\u2019m not telling you that you can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t make the photo restrictions \u2014 that\u2019s between you and your husband \u2014 I just think maybe it\u2019s more feasible to ask of this MIL. She\u2019ll sneak photos at some point, and if you\u2019ve given her an option where she can both follow your rules and post about her new grandchildren\u2026it\u2019s more likely to stick.)\n\nOP, this is gonna be a thing for the rest of your child\u2019s life, so absolutely start setting boundaries like this now. You guys making your (entirely reasonable, under the circumstances) wishes clear now may initially put you in her bad books, but as long as your husband is the one leading the discussion(s) with his mother, as long as you empathize with her perspective but hold firm to your bright lines, it will hopefully be manageable. \n\ngood luck!", "What did they expect when they set up a life thousands of miles away from their parents?", "Couldn\u2019t agree more", "You're missing the part where the world DOES NOT REVOLVE AROUND THE MIL!

She needs to respect the parents wishes and be grateful and look forward to the time she will get to spend with her new grandchild.

And kudos to your hubby for backing you up!", "NTA\n\nYou are the one carrying twins, and your partner agrees with your boundary.\n\nI'd recommend making more boundaries before the kids are born and making sure she knows she has to obey your rules.\n\n1. If MIL posts photos of your babies on social media without your consent, she is banned from seeing the babies for a month and will not be allowed to carry a mobile or camera for future visits.\nThis duration of this consequence can increase each time she breaks this boundary.\n\n2. You and your partner are responsible for keeping the grandparents informed of, eg, going into labour, the kids being born, your health status. If MIL overrides this and contacts your parents with an update without your consent, this will result in her being the last person to know updates for 1 month again, increasing with each breach of your boundaries.\n\n3. You and your partner are the parents of the twins you have the right to create or reduce rules and boundaries as you see fit, any breach of your rules will result in MIL being put on both an information diet plus reduced access.\n\n4.

You will not entertain uninvited guests and such guests will not cross the threshold of your home if they arrive unannounced and will be put at the end of the guest list until they learn to wait for an invite.\n\n5. The hospital needs to be informed who is allowed to see you and the babies in the hospital and who can be given updates via the phone. If the MIL tries to obtain information from the hospital without your consent, you will select one of the above consequences as a result of her boundary stomping.", "On the pictures thing NTA, but in my opinion it\u2019s pretty unreasonable to make one set wait while the other doesn\u2019t.

I appreciate your candor with all the adults involved. They're adults, after all.  Regardless of your reasons, they're YOUR reasons and if managing adult pettiness for your peace of mind is what you have to do, then do it.

If it was purely about meeting at the same time I'd have said you were an asshole, but MIL doesn't respect wishes and can't be trusted, that's entirely different. You want your parents to see their grandchild for the first time with their own eyes and I'm sure they would prefer that too. \n\nIf MIL is really upset then let her know that your decision is based on her inability to respect your past wishes and her own behaviour. There may be opportunities in the future for her to regain that trust so hopefully she learns or this will just become how you handle things. Actions have consequences. No doubt she'll beg for a second chance but that will only embolden her. I had a MIL who was like that.

Having a C section is a huge trauma to your body, equal to giving birth vaginally. I mean, think of it this way- you\u2019re going into a knife fight unarmed! I\u2019ve had abdominal surgeries and my best friend ended up having her baby this last January via C section when the delivery wasn\u2019t progressing as it should.

I'd suggest keeping her at a safe distance. Also Instagram is really unsafe for children pictures.", "Initially when I started reading I thought YTA for stipulating that the in-laws can only see their grandchild when the other set of gparents arrive but I see your MIL is a bit demanding/ doesn't listen to reason.

For my first, the nurse had to kick ppl out for me cause my blood pressure started skyrocketing and for my second (a C-section) I had someone come in, I thought it was a nurse, it was a friend whose boy was born a day after.  I had a catheter emptying as we talked. (Nice yellow fluid draining down a clear tube and no control over stopping it).

Just keep it private until your parents are there. No photo ops!", "NTA but access to babies is not a scarce resource so I'm a bit confused. It sounds like your objection to your MIL is really about how she will treat you and your kids like a prop in her narcissistic dramas, which makes total sense and your husband is going to need to assert boundaries early and often. \"Seeing the baby first\" is not a real thing that parents care about, it will be immediately forgotten by everyone. Turning your life into her drama is a real thing and will lead to a lot of bitterness.", "NTA because the truth is that as the parents, you don't need a reason to say people need to wait to meet your child, or that they aren't allowed to post pictures of them.", "your partner is a godsend.\n\nI agree with your partner. wait a full week. let queen B wait.

Do yourself a favor- stick to your guns. No MIL at the hospital and she can come visit when your parents get there.", "NTA. It sounds like you and your husband have clear knowledge of who your MIL is and how she weaponizes her grandchildren or uses them to brag about herself. She\u2019s only going to get worse unless you continue to set boundaries and enforce them. The only people who get mad about boundaries are the ones trampling all over them, so the problems is hers not yours. \n\nA story in solidarity - Your MIL sounds like my grand-MIL. When my husband was growing up, his grandmother was notorious for blatantly favoring some grandchildren over the others and fomenting arguments and tension between her children (my MIL and her sisters).  Early on when my husband and I were married, she sent me a FB friend request and I accepted with the knowledge I would have to keep an eye on her deviousness. Several months later I was proven right when my MIL mentioned that on their weekly phone call her mom had told her about the pictures I showed her from a trip I took with a friend. I had not shown them to my GMIL, I had posted them on Facebook. I told my husband that no one was going to purposely make my MIL feel badly and get away with it and they for damn sure weren\u2019t going to use me to do it. I told him I was restricting her on my FB feed so that she could only see my older posts and nothing going forward. He thought I wasn\u2019t going far enough, but restricting her seemed to do the trick.", "NTA\n\nThe \"before my parents\" is incredibly selfish. However as your MIL has shown she has no self control I have to agree with you.", "NTA assuming your partner is the one making this decision as much as you are. Otherwise you are the asshole for deciding your half of the child's grandparents are worth more than your partners - regardless of how you frame them as annoying and pushy.\n\nYour folks new you were pregnant, they new your anticipated delivery, if this is so important they could have been ready to travel the moment you have birth or even right before. But you waited, and now everyone else has to as well.", "NTA, and good on you for structuring it all in ways that feel fair and reasonable to you and your partner. And let me be clear: what you and your partner feel is fair is the only determinant here. Your MIL can suck lemons if she doesn't wish to comply. \n\nI love the idea of making all wait a week. It gives you some time to begin recovering from the c-section, and time for both of you to bond with your little ones before you have to be \"on\" and presenting to your families. That's a lot of work, and since at least one of your parents (MIL) is a wee-bit high maintenance, you should focus on conserving your energy for the important things. That's bonding, recovering, and supporting each other.", "NTA. Time to adjust to life with the new babies is not an unusual request for new parents to make, nor should it be one that gets pushback from family because you are going to be going through a medical event and should be able to rest comfortably to heal (I say this as someone who experienced the descent of the grandparents in law the day I gave birth, spent a couple of hours playing hostess instead of resting and ended up with a postpartum haemorrhage and blue lighted to hospital). \nGiven your MIL's predilection for FOMO-ing people I would tell your parents to block her number to be honest, and as for taking pics of babies - nope, she can have pics sent to her by you and hubby, that way you can control what \"content\" she has (get one of those pinboards to put in every shot saying \"NOT FOR USE ON SOCIAL MEDIA\" lol).", "NTA\n\nI'd set a blanket notice that you want the time to bond as a family and that everyone will receive an invitation to a meet and greet when you are ready to have visitors.\n\nYou aren't going to want the MIL in your face when you are recovering from a C-Section and caring for newborn twins. I'd highly recommend you pre-emptively issue that notice now.\n\nPersonally this relationship sounds like it would benefit from the MIL not having your parents phone number or social media either. Why does she need to be in direct contact with them? If she didn't have that connection she couldn't get to your family first and share your life with them before you could.", "Nta", "NTA. \n\nFrom a different perspective than other comments I've seen, (which I feel are correct in saying your baby, your decision) as someone who's had a c-section, there's not a chance in hell I'd have been willing to have anyone but my partner and my own mother see me afterwards. \n\nIt's uncomfortable, it's painful and the catheter didn't help glamorise things either. All I really wanted was to hold my baby and lie down quietly.", "What I get is:  \n\\- Your MIL does not respect your boundaries  \n\\- She has a tendency of causing drama and stepping on boundaries  \n\\- She acts as a victim when she's told you want her to keep your boundaries  \n\\- She thinks there's a competition and she must win\n\nShe seems like she must to be in control of all your lives and enjoys causing drama, and loves playing the victim. Therefore I recommend stopping her as soon as possible, before things escalate.\n\nSo here's what I'd do:   \nTell the MIL she is not allowed to take or post any pictured of the babies.  If needed (and honestly given how your MIL is, I think it's needed) point out how many predators are online who are looking for child photos for disgusting reasons. She does not want that to happen to her precious grandkids, no? Because you do not, and you have other reasons not to want photos online. But she only needs to know that you do not give her consent to upload any photo of your child.\n\nWhen she visits, ask her to give you her phone and/or camera when she arrives and give it back when she leaves, so she can't take pics secretly. You can give her printed photos and tell her explicitly that they're for her to view at her home, not for the internet to see. She can keep receiving printed photos as long as no photos end up online, so she can have plenty of memories. She uploads a photo? Remind her to your boundary and make sure she receives no more photos for a while. She uploads a photo again? Another boundary reminder, no photos and no visitation for a while. (You mention she's not very involved in her other grandkids' life so this should not be an issue for either parties.)\n\nIf your country/state has laws about needing parental consent to upload photos that show minors, make sure your MIL knows she's breaking a law by uploading photos of your child without your consent.  Keep saying that she does not have consent to upload any photos. If she still does it, first I recommend commenting under it and reminding her that you did not give consent to her to upload the photo and she has x hours to remove it before authorities (it can be just the site admins) are involved. Take a screenshot of the posted photo and your comment for future reference. Some social media sites, like Instagram, have a page (Google \"Report a violation of your privacy on Instagram\") where you can report your or your minor child's privacy being violated by a photo or video. If MIL won't remove the photo use the social media provided option.\n\nAlso, tell her she does not need to \"update\" your parents. You and your partner are grown adults who are capable of talking and can talk to them yourselves, you do not need her to do that. In fact, make it clear you do not want her to interact with your parents about your (or your childrens') life unless it's an emergency. Visiting you and them in the hospital or for a weekend is not an emergency and you expect her not to bother your parents about that. Maybe bring up some emergency examples for her to understand.\n\nAnother thing. Make sure she knows that neither of these things are about your parents. (So she can't blame them.) It's about her constantly stepping over your boundaries. Tell her that if she keeps jumping on your boundaries she'll lose her grandparent privileges.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are NTA. And I wish you a happy life with your kids :) Your partner sounds awesome, too. Good luck with your MIL.", "NTA. But to be clear, it sounds like the real issue here isn\u2019t that you want your parents to see the babies last. The real issue is MIL\u2019s insistence on blowing through all your boundaries. \n\nI think you need to be very explicit with MIL that the issue is with the non-consensual photos and the unwanted phone calls. If MIL cannot commit to respecting those boundaries, she can wait forever.", "NTA.  If your delivery date is scheduled for like, June 1, tell everyone you\u2019re scheduled for June 10. \n\nTell your parents the correct date so they can arrive on time. \n\nWhen the babies are born and JNMIL cries about the wrong date, just say they came early and you didn\u2019t have time to notify anyone amidst the chaos. \n\nHave hubby confiscate all phones when people come to visit, ESPECIALLY your JNMIL.  She has shown that she\u2019s in some crazy competition that nobody else is aware of, and at the same time, she\u2019s vindictive and petty. \n\nYour JNMIL (because, let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s what she is) is going to be a giant pain for the rest of your kids\u2019 lives.  You and hubby need to go on an \u201cinformation diet\u201d with her. Set expectations early and tell her that she won\u2019t see the kids if she continues to stomp on your boundaries. \n\nCongratulations, OP!", "NTA as a parents to be you and partner you get the final say.\n\nIt\u2019s not Mil who is being operated on caesarean is a relatively major operation.\n\nI would be inclined to email MIL and others in her family and say this is causing anxiety and that OB and midwife have stated I need to reduce my anxiety.  So their will be no more discussion this what is happening.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth I think you both need to tough it out or MIL will treat you like like on going doormat.\n\nI might add both of you could throw the ultimatum you either change your ways or we upsticks and move back to Europe.", "NTA - she hasn\u2019t respected your wishes whatsoever and it is only fair to make people wait also it\u2019s good to take time for yourself", "NTA", "ESH \n\nYour MIL sucks for using her grandkids and all. \nYou suck for not letting her see her grandchild only because your parents can\u2019t at the same time. That\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nAlso, when it comes to infants, it is a bad idea to have everyone come over at the same time. That\u2019s too much people, activity, noise etc for an infant. Best is to keep every visit in small groups.  (It\u2019s crazy to me how people never think about how an infant feels. Or a new mom.) Might be nicer for your wife, too, although that\u2019s for her to decide.", "NTA\n\nYour babies, you make the rules. You don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation. It sounds like MIL is going to continue playing victim and guilt tripping so if you need her to stop, your husband needs to tell her that this decision is final. It\u2019s not a negotiation and if she brings it up one more time, she will not get to meet your babies when everyone else does. Don\u2019t reward bad behavior. I\u2019d also make sure to set strong boundaries with her because she sounds like someone who is going to overstep.", "NTA for not wanting pictures and to setting your own rules. This is your right and it is good that your husband supports you.\n\nYour reasoning that you don\u0165 want your MIL to see the baby before your parents is a little bit weird though. She may be playing stupid games but you do not have to play along with her. It is not and should not be a competition or one-upmanship.", "NTA", "NTA, you\u2019re being plenty fair and it sounds like mil is forcing you to have to be fair since she likes to brag about her being there for more memories than your parents are", "NTA at all. \n\nI had my second right in the middle of the Covid crisis and honestly, the best thing was no visitors whatsoever in the hospital. For me it's my mother who's the problem (jealous we announced the second pregnancy to my MIL first - after we announced the first pregnancy to my parents first \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) and I was so happy to have those first three days just for my husband and I - although I did miss my older kid terribly. \n\nStay strong and all the best with your pregnancy!", "NTA but I would've given other valid reasons for keeping visitors at bay. Your OB might suggest that you wait a certain amount of time before exposing the twins to germs that might hitch a ride on those traveling relatives. That would be a way to make it fair while not singling out anyone and without punishing your MIL to make things even. Using your new babies to slight your in-law for someone else's sake is a strange way to start off parenthood. That part (making things even) comes across as petty, but I can understand the temptation to put her in her place if she's pushy and inconsiderate. I'm not saying that I would do that, but I can understand the reason-- I wouldn't let her bring out the worst in you. There are so many good reasons to keep visitors at bay while you're recovering and the babies are especially vulnerable-- why choose and express one that's bound to cause bitterness, division, and more stress?", "NTA. Your MIL doesn't sound very kind.", "NTA. I was prepared to judge you harshly until you framed MIL\u2019s behaviour.

They help you, you take care of the babies. If they are overwhelming you,  upsetting you they get out!  I let family meet mine at the hospital then everyone left us alone until we were ready to come out which was about 2 weeks later.

It takes a level of experiencing this type of situation to understand it. Honestly, stop justifying the why to your MIL.

To trust that she cares about treating yall right, instead of manipulating to get her way. Until you have this trust, the only answer she gets is that it\u2019s yalls decision. When you MIL pressures you, always circle back to its your decision. Nothing more, just it\u2019s your decision. This is you and your husband\u2019s decision, she doesn\u2019t have to like it.

It's a pretty wild thing for your doctor to say. Same doctor probably refuses to do vaginal births ever once you've had a c-section, too. Obstetrical care can really be a mess, you'll have to fight against interventions if you don't want them, like inductions, labour augmentation, episiotomies, unnecessary c-section, etc. \n\nAs for your main question, NTA.

My MIL was a blabbermouth and had to tell everyone's business before they were able to speak to people themselves.  It got to the point where she was told last or with others.

There will never be a \u201cfair\u201d division of quality time between the grandparents.\n\nMy parents emigrated from the Philippines to the US before I turned two. I didn\u2019t meet my maternal grandparents until I was 7. They actually came to the US to emigrate as well so they lived with us for about 6 years before they were able to have their own place. It wasn\u2019t until later when I finally met my paternal grandparents. I was I think 9 or 10 by then but they didn\u2019t want stay in the US. They came and visited or we went to visit them during my teen years. \n\nThe time I got to spend with both sides was different but never where I favored one over the other. The amount of love and attention was immeasurable and couldn\u2019t be quantified nor compared. I loved them all the same because they made our times together special, made me feel special.\n\nThat\u2019s the important part. The children will know how important they are based on how the grandparents treat them. If MIL only uses the children as props for some performative gesturing in a social media fantasy life, the children will pick up on that. MIL will miss out on building a real relationship with them in the long run if this is truly her intention.\n\nI understand OP\u2019s wanting her parents to have something special when the twins are born but really it won\u2019t be until the kids are older that it will matter.

I wish I had done this with my first, even though I didn't have MIL issues (at least at the time). I had a scheduled c-section with my first child that turned into an emergency c-section after the epidural caused my son's heart rate to suddenly drop before my doctor had arrived. Due to the issues at birth, my son was taken to the NICU for monitoring before I had a chance to see or hold him. Since I had the epidural, they said I would have to wait 12 hours to go see him to allow the epidural to completely wear off before I got up. But since our families were waiting at the hospital, they all went to see my son. When everyone came to my room with pictures of my son on their phones, I was heartbroken. \n\nP.S. Bravo to both of you for setting boundaries early!", "NTA. Your MIL cried at dinner in front of the whole family because she is not getting what she wants, when she wants, and what she really wants is to show your mother that she's more important.

And I think as a woman having your first child (children in your case) you want your mum there\u2026naturally you will be closer to your mum/parents when it comes to having a baby. I was exactly the same with my parents, I wanted them at the hospital first. It\u2019s all about mama I\u2019m afraid\u2026and lucky mama for having a husband who understands that too!!!\nNTA", "NTA stick to your guns. I had a c section and we were under COVID protocols so only my husband could be there. Honestly, not having a revolving door at the hospital was wonderful.

That\u2019s reason enough to limit visitors, let alone a relative who just wants to be there for the photo op, and the social media blitz. You are right not to want your kids\u2019 pictures posted on line. I also get that you want your own parents to share in the meeting of your babies, especially since they live so far away, and that your MIL seems to be the type to want to \u201cone-up\u201d them and already ruined your baby announcement. Her behavior damaged your trust. It sounds like you were just trying to be honest and up front with MIL, but sometimes that can backfire, given it\u2019s a sensitive issue. It would have been better to just say you need a few days to recover (which would also have been true). Anyway, you have every right to ask what you are asking and your husband is supporting your wishes. I think the idea of having a get together with all the grandparents together is a great idea, and probably less stressful for you and your husband because you can have one event. Taking care of 2 newborns will be challenging at first, and hopefully you can patch things up with MIL so that she can be a support to your family as you settle in to your routine.", "NTA\n\nYour MIL has a history of stomping boundaries and using her grandchildren to being a self-focused twit. \n\nAnd it would be fair to share that, \"MIL, to be frank, your past behavior has shown that we can't trust you to respect our boundaries or not be insensitive to other family members. For that reason, you will have to wait. If that's upsetting for you,  I would suggest you reflect on how your actions have led to this point. Our children's lives aren't about your wants.\" \n\nI would also end any encounter where she attempts to shame you in front of the family via water works. \"I see that you're intent on playing the part of the victim right now. I'm not interested in playing this game with you, so I will leave.\" Then take a break from her for at least 2 weeks. \n\nBut also stop going back and forth with her.

I also had a c-section and had people up in my business the day I got out of the hospital and I was miserable. I felt better as soon as they left me alone. Trust me when I say you are most likely not going to want to see anyone that isn't your babies, the person who helped make the babies, and medical professionals for at least a little while. You can frame it that way to your mother in law if you think it'll help, especially if there's a few days before your parents get to your house.\n\nAs for pictures on social media, I am also very strict on that. I've made it clear that if someone really feels the need to post my daughter, they have to ask, and if it say no, it means no. If they don't listen, no more pictures.

I think it\u2019s best that you and your husband have time alone for the first day or few to bond with them, recovering from a major surgery and to process your own feelings on just having your children. You don\u2019t need his mom or anyone else there right away. You and him get to dictate the plans and the rules. MIL is mostly just made because she clearly want to be first. She\u2019s in a ridiculous competition with your parents which is extremely childish!! Personally, she\u2019d be the last to know after purposely ruining your pregnancy announcement the way she did, just to rub it in your moms face that she knew first, if I were you.

She can't be trusted.", "NTA\n\nYou are the one delivering, you get to say who comes into the hospital room. Same with visiting at home.

Your kids are YOUR kids, not hers, not your parents, YOURS. Being grandparents doesn't entitle them to do whatever they want with your kids, you set the rules and boundaries and have everyone abide by them. Cutting her or others off from contact may be an option if she doesn't respect you or your partners wishes.\n\nTwins will be hard, so you and your partner need unconditional support and love. You need people there to do everything not relayed to the kids for a few months (cook, clean, chores,  etc) so you can rest and recover from the C-section. She sounds like she will be there for her own gain, not yours, so having a real heart to heart about your expectations of her and other guests postpartum will help.\n\nWith our first kid born during peak covid, we were very strick on what people could do leading up to visiting. My wife's mom (also a narcissist) didn't respect that, called all sorts of names and made it all about her, and my wife ended up cutting her out her and our lives completely, no contact for over a year. \n\nYour kids will be your joy, focus on them, minimize time spent on those who don't support you.", "NTA.

The fact she acts like a child at her age is embarrassing", "What I\u2019m saying is that she\u2019s setting a boundary thst her child isn\u2019t a prop for MIL\u2019s attempts at getting attention and that she\u2019s prioritizing her parents feelings over MIL wanting photos to use as a tool online.\n\nIf MIL was truly over the moon excited about this baby, she\u2019d be totally okay with waiting 1 week to show pictures off if it meant holding/seeing the baby. \n\nShe\u2019s already overstepped OP about a baby shower and tried to make that about her. \n\nIt\u2019s not only okay for OP to draw a line, it\u2019s appropriate because other clearly MIL is going to continue on in a similar vein (at least until another grand baby is born and she gets distracted)", "An angel doesn't rub it in someone's face that they know that OP is pregnant before OP can tell her parents.  An angel doesn't use their grandchildren as photo ops to make other people jealous or for internet points.", "You seen some of the mils here they crossed  boundaries and acted luke it was a do over. Ot a gc aka a controlling nature", "I also lived close to both sets of grandparents until one set moved away, and I honestly wish I wasn\u2019t dragged to the second set as often as I was because we were very much not welcome there and my sister and I were very aware of that fact.", "I\u2019m not saying that she doesn\u2019t rub it in or whatever. I\u2019m saying they could potentially deprive their child of a relationship. Which isn\u2019t fair to the child involved to miss out on having a close set of grandparents. None of this stuff actually mistreats the child. You can be a shitty person and still love your family and treat them well. That child is also going to see grandmom loving their cousins and not them because their parents didn\u2019t allow her around to keep things fair. This should be less about how MIL is as a person and more about how she actually treats her grandchildren. Keep in mind it\u2019s not just MIL who would be punished here. There\u2019s a complete family dynamic the kid would miss out on, because it wouldn\u2019t just affect the kid\u2019s relationship with MIL.", "It seems the issue is just with the word punishment. Like you think punishment has a negative connotation so op would be wrong for punishing MIL...even if a punishment is really just a negative consequence and this negative consequence is an appropriate result of MIL violating reasonable boundaries.", "this is OP side of the story.\n\nthe real reason most likely is OP is jealous of MIL.", "My dad\u2019s grandma was a hoarder and they lived in the absolute backwoods of WV.\n\nMy options were to play in a creek or watch Winnie The Pooh way way past age appropriate because that was literally all there was to do. \n\nI\u2019d show up with like 5 books for a weekend and leave with them all read and my little ass was dyslexic and ADHD undiagnosed so that\u2019s saying a lot lol.\n\nJust because someone is related does not meat your kid has to bond with them.", "Ngl, if mil doesn\u2019t respect a simple boundary like \u2018no photos\u2019 then I wouldn\u2019t trust them around the kids. Someone who only cares about appearances is not someone I\u2019d want my children having a relationship with. Who knows what she\u2019d say to the kids behind the parents\u2019 backs? She doesn\u2019t actually care about the relationship with the grandchildren - otherwise why not just forgo the pictures and visit at the hospital and support the parents?", "You\u2019re the one who used the word first though lol. Neither I, nor OP, did. \n\nAnd frankly, even if we\u2019re going done the \u201cpunishment\u201d line \u2014 some of her behavior deserves rebuke. \n\nWhy would OP be wrong to \u201cpunish\u201d MIL for, say, sharing private information about her body? Or harassing her parents? Or posting photos of her children without permission?\n\nEdit: Oh, I see where you were getting \u201cpunishment\u201d from. I wasn\u2019t describing it as a punishment, I was replying to the person above me who did so.", "ESH.  Mil\u2019s demands are brave considering she doesn\u2019t have the rights she thinks she does \n\nBut , gently, I don\u2019t think I would make one family wait until the other could get there .  It\u2019s not fair to your parents but it isn\u2019t fair to his family either \n\nIf it were a rule for any other reason, I think I may get behind it (example : we just don\u2019t want people to meet baby until 2 weeks, etc.)", "It\u2019s not fair that your MIL isn\u2019t going to meet her grandchild because you want your parents to meet the twins first. If your parents really want to be there you\u2019re having a schedule c-section so they can arrange flights if not both at least one of them. It truly isn\u2019t fair to prevent your mil from seeing the twins because you want your parents to meet them first. With my two youngest my parents didn\u2019t see them until they were 3-5 months ( they live 1 hr from me) but I didn\u2019t stop my mil for. Seeing them \n\nTo me YTA because you\u2019re your using pictures and social media as the excuse for wanting to prevent your mil from seeing your twins because you want your parents to meet them first which is okay!! So when you know when the twins are coming help your parents get a flight a few days before and have them stay a month or two  besides you\u2019re going to need some help with the babies are here and you\u2019re going to want your mom to help you \n\nBest of luck and I hope your delivery goes smoothly", "You people are fucking awful. Good luck to the dad/husband. Life is gonna be rough between your wife and mother. Neither are going to let you have a stress fee life.", "ESH. Your mother in law sounds terrible but it also feels like you resent her for being there when you made the decision to live far from your family. Your reasoning to limit that relationship because of other limited relationshipswas so ridiculous it made things much worse. You have to do what's best for your child- nuclear families and lack of relationships with extended family are being linked to the rise in mental health crises, especially among youth. Also be careful about limiting your own support network- my friend had a fight with her family before delivery and was ready to do it all without them, until she had her kid and had to be hospitalized for a week, and they took care of her kid while her husband was with her.", "ESH.\n\nFirst, if you tell MIL that you are not keen on having her at the hospital for any reason whatsoever, the only correct response on her part is, \"Of course -- whatever is most comfortable for you. You let me know when you're ready. If you need anything in the meantime don't hesitate to call.\" That's what a decent human being does. Childbirth and recovery is a very personal, emotional time. No one is entitled to be there. They earn the right to be there by respecting and suporting you.\n\nSecond, your reasoning on the grandparents is bogus. You've appointed yourself allocator of \"fairness.\" That's above your pay grade. Suppose your parents weren't able to for 3 months and MIL was otherwise a decent human being, you're going to make her wait until your parents get there \"to be fair\"? You chose to live in a different country than your parents.\n\nThird, if your parents are reasonably emotionally healthy and MIL called them saying \"I've seen the babies, here's a picture,\" the rational response would be, \"Oh, they're beautiful, can't wait to be there in person, thank so much for the picture!\" If their response is \"Damn you, you saw them first\" then they sound as toxic as MIL.", "Esh her for being pushy and spoiling announcements and u for basically telling her your family is more important than her. Both grandparents should be equal", "This all sounds ridiculous from the start to me. Is there some magic ritual that will fail if one set of grandparents see the baby before the others?\n\nI swear people make up rules like this just to have an excuse for drama.", "I personally hate this mentality. Depriving someone of something to make it even. If your parents wanted to see the kid enough they\u2019d fly there immediately. Making the in laws miss out cause your parents can\u2019t get their earlier is kinda AH move. But also Sorta not the AH cause I guess you can do what you want, it\u2019s your kid", "ESH. Sorry, but this is just a lot of controlling people in one family! I am exhausted from reading this. The only one that is not a control freak is the husband, as they are his kids too and he just goes with the flow to avoid the fight.", " Yes, yta. That\u2019s some petty shit.", "YTA -- not for setting limits amd boundaries for your new little family, but for imputing all negative intentions and actions to your MIL when you CLEARLY have issues of your own when it comes to her. If you had just said that you wanted to hold off receiving visitors for a few days and would let everyone come at once, it would be fine; instead, you chose to be intensely critical of your MIL, which shows a lot about you and how little respect you show her.", "YTA. Why are you playing these games? It sounds exhausting. You are not a referee. Obviously your parents know they live farther away then your MIL, can they not handle this? Set your boundaries and stop trying to keep score.", "INFO: what does your husband think? It\u2019s his baby too", "Yes! Can we please normalize women dictating when and who sees baby, especially right after they've undergone a major medical procedure? (Whether vaginally or cesarean it's no small thing) Parents need time to bond and process things and mom especially has lots of healing to do. Parents can decide for themselves to what extent having people around will be helpful or harmful in their specific situation. Yes, it's wonderful that family wants to share in the new baby. But your immediate family unit does need to take priority for your own sanity and well being. Let's normalize women saying no to the baby swarmers.", "I agree. If her parents were close, would she had set the same boundary...having her parents wait on mil to arrive too.", "Agreed.\n\nLike... both sets of grandparents sound like a pain in the butt. Worry about real things not baby announcements and pics on Instagram.", "As I said twice in the post, husband agrees.", "Yep.  MIL sounds like a narcissist imo.  Makes things about herself, tries to manipulate others to get what she wants.  It's best to put strong boundaries with folks like her and stick to them.\n\nOh, and OP is NTA.", "I thought that at first, but her in-laws live near her and her parents live thousands of miles away. It makes sense for her parents and her husband\u2019s parents to have some means of reaching each other in case of emergency.", "Yes!  Don\u2019t get people saying that part is wrong.  Nothing wrong with giving the grandparents equal access when you\u2019re talking about less than a week to start with.  Not unreasonable at all!  Especially with the local grandmother so competitive already\u2026she will ruin it for the other set.  \n\nAnd I would  NOT let her at the hospital at all\u2026she\u2019s already made it clear she will use that opportunity to lord it over the other grandparents and that\u2019s totally unfair. She can\u2019t be trusted.  She\u2019s more interested in her social media posts than anything else. \n\nI\u2019d just tell them that OP and SO have decided the entire birth/hospital and \u201cx\u201d days after are only for parents and babies to bond and start their lives together, period.  Others enter that family group at a later time and grandparents all together.  MIL sounds like a piece of work\u2026especially since this isn\u2019t her first grandkid but it is for the other grandparents.  OP is NTA.", "I love your answer! So true!", "And that is why you should ask for additional info if you don't know the answer to something.  You don't just assume you know what someone is thinking that you have never met.", "Why is she jealous of a person whose only goal is to take pictures to show off on social media or brag to people that she knows something or gets to do something first?  OP is setting boundaries with a woman who doesn't believe in them and OPs husband is fully supporting her.  These are their children so they get to decide who meets these kids and when.  OPs husband has even suggested that both sets wait one week after the birth to see the babies.  That would give OPs parents time to get to OP, and OP and her husband time to bond with again THEIR children."]}
