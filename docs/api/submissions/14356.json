{"id": 14356, "submission_id": "12gi8dm", "title": "AITA for stopping my MIL meeting my newborn until my own parents can fly over and meet them too?", "selftext": "Throwaway account:\n\nI (32F) told my MIL (63F) that I wasn\u2019t letting anyone see my twins when they were born until my parents (53F and 57M) could fly from France to Canada and then everyone could come and meet them all at the same time to make it fair. She\u2019s upset because she won\u2019t get pictures at the hospital to post on social media, which I\u2019ve already said I don\u2019t want any pictures online of my kids at all. \nShe has other grandkids so this is not her first, however it is my parents first grandchild. MIL uses her other grandkids as a photo op to make her estranged family jealous of her life on Instagram, but that\u2019s as far as her involvement actually goes. I moved from France to Canada for my job and chose to stay there, I love it here but I do wish it were my family here with me as my parents and grandparents are really involved people, call to ask about how I\u2019m doing every day etc. They\u2019re devastated that they won\u2019t be in the hospital and the last thing I want is my MIL posting pictures everywhere or showing hospital pics to my Mother and upsetting her, because she has been known to do that (she ruined our announcement while we were on the plane on the way to tell my family by texting my mum first).   \nI will likely have to have a c-section as both babies are big and these are my firsts, so my OB isn\u2019t keen on me delivering naturally, she thinks it\u2019s safer to schedule a csection and I will do whatever they think is best. Therefore I think it\u2019s even better that people don\u2019t come immediately as I\u2019m going to be a mess, there\u2019s two babies and it\u2019s just going to be a lot. \nMy partner (33M) is in full support of me and thinks it\u2019ll be good to have private bonding time and for everyone to come at once. Plus my parents will be staying in the basement apartment of our house like they always do when they visit, so would give my partner and myself a break to sleep for an hour or two etc during their trip which will be a godsend after a few days in hospital. \n\nMIL says I\u2019m preventing her from being a grandmother as I also refused a baby shower (in my culture it\u2019s bad luck to receive baby gifts until the babies are born, so a shower is seen as bad luck) and it\u2019s not fair that she won\u2019t get to meet them first, but I told her that she would be getting more than my parents, like more birthday parties, more time with kids etc purely because my parents are on a different continent. She cried last night at dinner in front of the whole family but we held firm. My parents already know about the c-section and are going to fly asap depending on the winter flights, but either way they\u2019ll be there within 3-4 days or birth and sooner if we get a c-section date as they can pre-plan their flights so it\u2019s not like MIL is going to be kept in the dark for months??? It\u2019s literally a couple of days! Everyone will get a picture of babies from the hospital and are welcome to come and meet them all at once. \nAITA?\n\n[Edit1: I\u2019m just adding that we have spoken to MIL about no pics, she said she wanted memories. We told her that if no pictures were taken we would be more open to her coming to the hospital, her response was that that would be nice and then she could call my Mum and give her an update. Our parents have a strained relationship already due to MIL ruining our pregnancy announcement, so would 100% see her calling with updates as her rubbing it in that they can\u2019t be there. I understand that I have made things hard by moving to another country, I\u2019m just trying to give both sides of the family fair access without one upsetting the other.\nMy partner is in full agreement and actually suggested making everyone wait a full week before anyone met babies, so he doesn\u2019t mind making them wait]", "created_utc": 1681043736, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gi8dm/aita_for_stopping_my_mil_meeting_my_newborn_until/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How you're setting this up is going to led to conflict between your MIL and your parents, where they feel like they have to compete for \"favorite grandparent\" and who has more facetime. That's just not fair to the baby. You really should be focusing on each of them getting their own special introduction with the baby, no matter who gets there first.\n\n\nSounds like your more worried about her taking and posting pictures and in general issues with you and her relationship. So talk to her about that, don't link it to your parents visit. If you don't want her at the hospital that's fine, plan a special introduction for her at your house. Also, have you even talked to your parents about if they mind being sent pictures and updates by your MIL. There's always a chance they would like it, since they won't be able to be there for the moments. Despite a difficult relationship with me, my MIL is very close to my children and its very special she was able to met them at the hospital. I wouldn't start her relationship with your child on such a negative note, give her a chance to be a good grandmother and if she doesn't that's on her.", "ESH.

Seriously?  Life IS NOT FAIR. Life does NOT give ANY GUARANTEES.  \n\nPeople can see the baby on YOUR schedule, that is YOUR CALL as a parent.

The ONLY people allowed at the hospital or the baby for the first 6 weeks were the maternal grandparents.  Nobody pitched a fit. We dropped meals at their front door, texted to check in, received photos and face time calls because mom knew we respected her and wouldn\u2019t post online.

It seems like this may not be the first time you will have to stand for a difference of opinion when it comes to your kids and MIL.\n\nManipulation is not ok and that's exactly what she is doing.\n\nCongratulations on the twins by the way! hope all goes great and everyone is happy/healthy!", "I get where you are coming from and am not close with my MIL\u2026not passing judgement, just a thought: four grandparents meeting and vying for new babies attention is a LOT, even if there are two of them! If you allow your MIL a \u201cquick\u201d visit in the hospital (NO PHOTOS) the nurses can usher to em out in 20 min, regardless in what order your parents meet babies, all of them all at once may make your head spin! Congrats and good luck!! \u2764\ufe0f", "Last two sentences of my first paragraph.", "Life is not fair and it's ignorant of you to think that doing this will make things fair.", "I agree with other commenters that say you are within your right to not allow visitors, but the reasoning you give makes no sense and seems petty. \"Fair\" does not exist in life and it's naive/ignorant of you to think that doing this is going to make things \"fair\". Furthermore, trying to make things \"fair\" is the basis for transactional relationships, most of which are unhealthy.", "Do you even like your baby daddy? It's his kid too", "Like this is so petty\n\nIf you have a problem with her respecting boundaries, then address the problem. \n\nStop comparing between your parents availability and making it a competition. It will only exhaust you and create conflict in your life. \n\nHer meeting the baby first in itself is not the issue you are making it. Address the issues.", "What you are doing is extremely petty\n\nIt should also be your husbands choice, not just yours. You should not get unilateral say what so ever.\n\nAll you are doing is making needless drama.", "It's an old low value person, see no reason to waste effort on it.", "No, she's flexing on both her husband and the paternal grandmother. If her mother were local, she would have already seen the babies already.", "We tried, but she stated she wanted memories. We explained she could come to the hospital if no pictures, but then she said \u2018that would be nice and then I could call your mum and update her\u2019. Which set me off again, because to me that\u2019s just her wanting to rub it in to my mum that she\u2019s already seen them.", "Thank you - I\u2019m sh*tting myself a little bit haha! Hoping for a natural delivery for a quicker recovery time \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb", "Thank you for the suggestion!", "My partner is in full agreement with me and even thought we should wait a week before anyone came at all.", "As in the edit, my husband is 100% in agreement :)", "\ud83d\ude02 as  a 2x parent with toddlers, I assure you nothing is more high value than a local grandparent who can babysit. Let's all pray you never become old and low value\ud83d\ude44", "Maybe read the post first. The babies aren\u2019t even born yet.", "If her mother was local, both the mother and mother-in-law would see baby at same time. OP wants the baby's grandmothers to be there at the same time.", "So what? You're being petty. So when MIL shows up to see the babies with your parents, are you going to argue over who holds them first? Not wanting her to take pictures right away is fair and understandable. I would want my space in the hospital after birth too. The rest of your position/attitude isn't really reasonable. Remember it's your MIL who will be there to help you any time you need it. Perhaps you should be kind instead of contributing to an inevitably toxic situation.", "It'll all be ok, you got this!\n\nHaha becoming a parent in general is about the strongest reality check you could ever get. But it's the best and most beautiful things that happens in our lifetime. It's an amazing feeling becoming a parent and your whole point of view in life changes the second they are here. It's an undescribable feeling. It seems overwhelming now but once they are here, instinct jumps in and you'll never look back.", "Put that in the post then. I thought you had some sort of vendetta  NTA then"]}
