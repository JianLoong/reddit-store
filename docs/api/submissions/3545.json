You just met someone, you were LAUGHING at their appearance. Nothing about what you did was well meaning or kind.", "Wow. YTA.  Just reading it, it sounded condescending.  And that's not a complement.  Telling a grown ass woman that she looks like a child is never a good thing.  IMO you messed up.  There were so many better ways to complement her.", "YTA.... I (28F) get told all the time how young I look and it gets a little annoying. I was actually talking to someone the other day about my husband and children and she interrupted me and was like \"How do you have children!? You look 12!!\". As someone who deals with this a lot, it doesn't seem like a compliment", "Laughing at an adult woman and telling her she looks like a teenager is not a compliment.\n\nYTA", "YTA......mainly because you said it to her in such a condescending tone, laughing all the way.  I am one of those people who always appeared much younger than my actual age, and I'm now at the age where I take such comments as \"you look so YOUNG!\" with much appreciation.  However, Stella is not of that age, yet.  She wants to be taken seriously, as the young woman she is.  I recall feeling the same way....I didn't want to be told I looked 15 when I was 25.  Keep your compliments to \"oh, you all look so lovely!\" and you won't be looked upon as AH material.", ">\"I hope I don't look like a teenager in that one\" and I said \"I'm sorry, but you do\n\nShe was telling you that she didn't appreciate the comment. You doubled down. YTA.\n\nCan you imagine your attitude multiplied in the workplace? How many of her colleagues and bosses don't take her seriously because she looks young (and female)? You just added to the pile of condescension that she experiences all the time.", "YTA. You meant it as a compliment, but it didn\u2019t land that way. For you, as a woman in her 40s, looking youthful is a great thing. For a woman in her 20s trying to be taking seriously in the world, your words implied that she looks immature, like a little girl. \n\nYou probably can\u2019t fix this, but you can learn from it. Best rule of thumb is to refrain from commenting on other people\u2019s physical appearance, especially things they have no control over. Unless you\u2019re telling them \u201cOMG YOUR DRESS HAS CAUGHT ON FIRE!!!\u201d often we\u2019re best not to say anything about the way someone else looks.", "YTA.  Commenting on aspects of people's appearance that they can't control/immediately fix is an AH move.  Telling a grown ass woman she looks like a teenager, and doubling down and insisting it's a good thing when she tells you it bothers her makes it that much worse.  Not everyone is so desperately afraid of aging that they want people to tell them they essentially look like a child.\n\nAlso if it was such a \"compliment\" why were you laughing at her?", "YTA\n\nFor blatantly laughing at someone just taking a picture. \n\nFor commenting on someone's looks in a way thats not a compliment. \n\nFor then doubling down in the second conversation. \n\nAnd more than anything for not apologizing and being very kind so the person you insulted feels better and the bride doesn't have to have her event and future events ruined by your crap.", "YTA. Your heart's in the right place though so I'll help break it down for you.\n\nIn your 30s/40s and above, it is often a compliment to be told you look younger. This is when the physical ramifications of getting older really start to manifest.\n\nHOWEVER. Nobody in their 20s cares about looking younger. Why? They're ALREADY young. They may even be in their physical prime at this point. In fact, looking like a teenager is a step backwards in the developmental phase. So you telling her that she looks like a teenager can easily be misconstrued as a comment that she looks immature or juvenile in overall demeanor and behavior.\n\nEDIT - I'd also like to add what looking like a \"teenager\" means for many people: acne, undeveloped boobs, terrible haircut, not allowed/don't know how to wear makeup, can't afford nice clothes, and of course my ultimate favorite attribute: incredibly low self esteem.", "Yeah, I get that you didn't mean it as an insult, but YTA. First off, please try not to laugh at other people's appearances. This is rude. At the very least, contain your laughter until the person you're laughing at can't see you.\n\nSecond, \"you look like a teenager\" is a very weird thing to say 'as a compliment.' Is that supposed to make her feel attractive? Ick. Teenagers do not look attractive to reasonable adults. They look like teenagers. \n\nThird, doubling down when she told you your comments made her sad was also not a good move. A better response would have been \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you sad.\" Our culture may idolize youth, but telling another woman she should appreciate being mistaken for a teenager rather than her actual age... is equivalent to telling her that being her actual age is less valuable or less beautiful than being a teenager. This is not a compliment. \n\nYour intentions may not have been bad, but I would still advise giving Stella an apology for what you said.", "YTA.\n\nThere are better ways to compliment others youthful appearance other than laughing and telling them they look like a kid", "YTA. It's not a compliment when you laugh", "YTA. That wasn\u2019t a compliment, it was rude.", "It may have been intended as a compliment, but you should have the realization that the recipient didn't see it that way. And isn't the goal of a compliment to say something positive about the recipient? \n\nYTA.", "Yta, a stranger saying that would sound so rude and condescending.\n\nAlso, it doesn't matter how you feel about it, or what your intent was. You made a comment, and it upset her.", "YTA - you look like a child is basically what you\u2019re telling her.", "YTA here IMO. Not for saying she looked like a teenager - but for not apologizing and making amends to Stella clearly told you that what you said upset her.", "Yta, maybe this person is really complexed about her apearance and telling her she looks like a teenager hurt her on a wayyyy deeper level than you might imagine! If you were laughing on top of it you probably made it worse, and it did not sound like a compliment at all to her most probably!\nSome people have body dismorphia because of other people's comments! Next time you can just tell her she looks adorable instead. I would make sure to apologize to her if I were you.", "YTA laughing at someone for how they look and then trying to pass it off as a compliment is rude af. She was rightfully offended and you owe her an apology.", "YTA she didn\u2019t ask your opinion. Just cause you want to hear that you look young doesn\u2019t mean that everyone else does", "You can call it a compliment and mean it as a compliment but it doesn't change the fact that you offended her. You owe her an apology.  YTA", "YTA telling she looks like a teen is insulting not a compliment. You are basically infantilizing her then you double down when you know she didn\u2019t like it the first time you said it. That makes you double the AH", "\"i started laughing because a grown woman looked like a teenager, and when she asked why i was laughing i told her\" how can you not see how that makes YTA? are you willfully ignorant?", "YTA.\n\nI almost gave this a 'nobody' rating' but you just eked over the edge.\n\nThe first time, you intended it as a compliment and it was out of ignorance.\n\nThe second time, though, she specifically told you that she didn't think it was a compliment. You even apologized and said \"I'm sorry\" as you were saying it. This time, you weren't offering it as a compliment anymore, it was actually an honest criticism at that point.\n\nI don't think \"honest criticism\" earns you the AH rating especially because she prompted/asked for it in her comment. If this was where the story ended then it would have been the 'nobody' rating.\n\nBut then as she was walking away you tripled down: \"You'll appreciate it when you're my age.\" This part was completely unasked for and you are insisting that your opinion on it being a compliment matters more than her actual own expressed feelings: She *literally told you* that it made her sad, *now*. Who cares how she feels about it when she's older? You're making her sad *now*. And pretending like that doesn't matter.\n\nShe expressed that your comment would hurt. You said \"I'm sorry\" and then made the comment anyway. Then she expressed your comment *did* hurt. And you rubbed salt right in that wound.\n\nThe entire interaction comes off to the outside observer as you completely failing to take her feelings into consideration in spite of her communicating them to you quite clearly.", "YTA. If someone laughed at me and said I looked like a teenager, I wouldn\u2019t take that as a compliment. \n\nYou could\u2019ve apologized after you saw Stella didn\u2019t like what you said and you chose to double down and be condescending instead.\n\nWould you have been OK with her saying \u201cYou look like a grandma?\u201d", "YTA, as someone who looks way younger than I am comments about how someone looks like a teenager are so disrespectful.", "YTA\n\nI'm going to be 30 next week and I look like a teenager still. Last thing I want to hear from another woman is to \"appreciate looking young when I'm their age\".\n\nSorry we all don't look like we're ready to become crypt keepers or have wrinkles.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA. Calling someone a teenager isn't a compliment. Saying she looks younger than her age can be depending how it's delivered.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's pretty straightforward that infantilizing people by telling them they look like a teenager is a no-no.", "YTA \n\nas someone who is very young for working in an corporates industry. i cannot tell you how many times I've been looked over or ignored and people act SHOCKED when they learn my age. its so frustrating to not be taken seriously. its not a compliment.", "YTA  \n\n\nI say this as a fellow young-looking woman. I live in a college town and often get ID'd at restaurants (drinking age is 19) and people think my husband is my dad. We are six months apart in age. I'm in my early forties. If she didn't take it as a compliment, it wasn't one.   \n\n\nIt at the very least is annoying, but at its worst it's condescending and weird. 'You look like a child' is not a compliment. It just isn't.", "YTA nobody likes being told they look like a teenager, not even teenagers. Can we collectively move past the idea that \u201cyoung\u201d is a compliment anyway?

It\u2019s making fun of someone.\n\nETA: looking at your comments, you are definitely the  AH. You came here to get validation, realized people don\u2019t agree with you, so now you are saying you are never going to compliment anyone ever again and made fun of someone\u2019s username because they disagreed with your. Major AH status.

At her age, she\u2019s running away from youth.", "ew you're replying to the commenters like those creepy guys that go \"heeey I meant your ass was banging as a compliment\" Hhahahahahahah you so dumb babe. And you argue. I'm pissing my pants over here. yta. Repeat after me. If the person is offended, annoyed or hurt by your compliment it aint a compliment. \"I guess I'll just never compliment again...\"\n\nGrown people actually walk around reacting like this hahahahahah", "YTA. I\u2019m 27F and get told all the time that I look like I\u2019m 16. While it may seem like a compliment to you, to the person on the receiving end, it feels insulting and degrading. Being told they look like a teenager implies immaturity, an awkward demeanor, and, depending on the situation, incompetence. There is no compliment in these characteristics.", "I am in my mid-30s and am often mistaken for a teenager. It's not as flattering as you might expect. Quite frankly it can be very insulting and it's been a problem for me in my career as I'm not taken seriously since I \"can't have that much experience being so young.\" I'm constantly having to tell people my real age. Heck my (AGE APPROPRIATE) boyfriend's friends were riding him really hard about dating \"inappropriately young\" when we first got together and I told him he's free to tell them my actual age, even gave him a pic of my driver's license in case they didn't believe him. He had to use it...\n\nYTA.", "YTA. \"You look like a teenager\" isn't a compliment to most folks, especially not when you're literally laughing at them for taking a picture. More importantly, it clearly isn't a compliment to Stella, and in the end that's all that really matters here.", "YTA. Laughing at her and then explaining that\u2019s why makes it clear it\u2019s not a compliment. She told you she didn\u2019t like it and you reiterated it.

If it does, you're doing it wrong.", "YTA. I have had the same \"compliment\" but I always take offence. I fought for half of my life to be seen as an adult, and you call me a teenager.
