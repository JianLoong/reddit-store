We agreed since we love Isla and we didn\u2019t have anything going on that particular weekend. Last weekend was that weekend. \n\nOn Friday, our cat got loose and was hit by a speeding car. We took her to the vet, but it was too late. RIP Cleo, my sweet girl. My boyfriend and I don\u2019t have any kids, Cleo was the closest we had to a daughter. She was our baby girl, her loss is devastating. I spoke with my boyfriend, and we agreed that we weren\u2019t emotionally or physically capable of looking after a rowdy seven year old for two days. \n\nI called Helen and apologized and told her that we wouldn\u2019t be able to look after Isla. She asked why, and I explained about Cleo. Helen then said \u201cOh well even better! That means I won\u2019t have to worry about that bloodthirsty furball attacking Isla. So, what was the problem again?\u201d (Something to note, Cleo was a rescue cat who was very skittish around everyone but me and my boyfriend. Isla once chased Cleo down and tried to pick her up and Cleo scratched her. Helen never forgave Cleo for that.)\n\nI was stunned, for a moment I couldn\u2019t process. Then I blew up at her, I screamed into the phone and said some things I\u2019m not proud of. I don\u2019t remember all of it, but the thing that made her hang up was \u201cMaybe I should run Isla over with my car, see how you feel! You heartless bitch!\u201d \n\nLater that day, my mom called me. She started by talking about how sorry she was that Cleo\u2019s gone, how much she\u2019ll be missed, etc. Then, she started laying into me for what I said to Helen. She said that she understood that I\u2019m grieving, but that it was rude of me to cancel last minute because last minute childcare is quite expensive in our area. She also said that I should seek mental health help because \u201cmaking death threats against your niece isn\u2019t normal\u201d and implied that I was having some kind of psychotic break. \n\nI asked her if she knew what Helen said about Cleo, and she said that she did, but that I shouldn\u2019t take what Helen says so personally because I know she has empathy issues. She asked me to call Helen and apologize and tell her I wasn\u2019t serious. I told her that she was welcome to relay the fact that I wasn\u2019t seriously threatening Isla to Helen, but that I wouldn\u2019t apologize until Helen apologizes for what she said about Cleo. She sighed, wished me well, then hung up. \n\nSince then, my mom has called me a few more times to try to make peace, but I\u2019ve given her the same conditions each time.

Cool.\n\nESH but good lord lady get a grip.", "ESH\n Firstly I am truly sorry about your cat. Pets are family even if still animals and this is a horrible situation to be in. Your sister was so dismissive and cruel in what she said to you and having \"empathy issues\" is not an excuse at all. \nThat being said its is obvious you are going through a rough time. But you basically threatened an innocent child to make a point. Those are words you cannot take back. \nPlease take these next couple days and get in touch with a mental health professional. Its good in situations like these to have one in your corner", "ESH but I also wouldn\u2019t babysit for her again.", "ETA\n\nTo people who have pets, they are like their children. There is a reason we call them furbabies. People may think that, oh it's just a pet, to others it is their child. Just because it is not human does not mean you have any less right to grieve.\n\nMaybe you should not have told your sister that, but as a veryfied petty and in the heat of the moment, I might have done the same.", "ESH", "ESH except your mom. Your sister totally sucks but making death threats against your niece sucked too.", "ESH. \n\nYour sister shouldn't have said what she said even if she thought it. It was bad. What you said is horrific. You made a comment that you can't take back and would make any parent weary to have you around their child ever again. \n\nAlso, and I know it is unpopular, but your cat is not comparable to a child or the loss of a child. A beloved pet, yes. But a pet. You will adopt another cat. You will not be changed forever. If your sister lost her child she would be changed forever. Another child would not fill that void for your sister.", "ESH. If anyone should see a doctor your sister should for her empathy issues. Not only was she relieved but she seems *elated* that your cat is dead. Sure, you shouldn't have said what you did, that was awful, but you also just had a pet die and someone be absolutely awful about it. I think you should apologize for what you said, but not a second before your sister does.\n\nEdit; changed the judgment, but I still think the one who started the drama should apologize.", "ESH. Losing a pet is hard, but it is nothing like losing a child.

I don\u2019t care that people will downvote. You lost a beloved pet to a terrible accident, were in grief, and had someone make a huge asshole comment about her.

Anyone who downplays your grief isn\u2019t worth having in your life.", "NTA Your sister is an unbelievably cruel person. Anyone with sense at all knows you weren't actually threatening to run over your niece. Just trying to make your sister understand the pain from the loss of your furbaby. Your mom and sister can get over it, or not. I'm so sorry for your loss", "I don't like what you said but given you were grieving I'll stick to NTA. Your sister was insanely out of line with her comments about your cat, and I can see how it triggered you.", "It probably wasn't your best moment, but you were grieving and your sister wasn't hearing your pain. In fact, she was totally dismissing it. So you tried to make a relatable for instance that maybe was shocking but you were in pain and lashed out. \n\nLet me ask you, what would it have felt like if your mom said  \"Let me and dad (if he's around) take Isla and if things get a little wild for us, we may need to call you for some help, but otherwise we want to give you space to grieve and your sister space to relax. Let us try to help you both.\" Are they not close by?\n\nI feel like both of you girls need someone to give you a break. Your sister should have a mom group after 7 years of this parenting thing she could rely on. I don't think all alternative options have been explored.", "NTA- Grieving is grieving and your sister had no right to belittle your feelings. Your mom didn\u2019t help matters either and is a terrible negotiator. Sometimes plans don\u2019t work and this was clearly an act of god. Honestly, I bet your sister would have complained if you still allowed your niece to visit. It would have been all about how terrible of a time she had because you were sad and refused to do anything. No way to win here. If mom was so concerned, why didn\u2019t she step up and watch her grandchild?", "YTA what you said is so wrong I can\u2019t even think about saying anything but that YTA and you suck", "YTA - I know childless people think of pets like children, but it\u2019s different when you create a being and they share your DNA. I think the comparison to running over your niece is out of line.", "When my cat died, my husband and I were inconsolable. You were in no position to care for a child. \n\nNTA", "Honestly NTA. Sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire", "NTA \n\nWas what you said unacceptable? Yes absolutely. You were overcome with emotion and clearly regret it, and you had no intention of going through with it. Her on the other hand? She was in full control of her emotions and words, and even your mother admits she has empathy issues. Take all the time and space you need to grieve, RIP Cleo.", "ESH", "In what possible world are you not the asshole for saying you'll murder your sister's child?\n\nHelen was extremely cruel and inconsiderate, but her lack of empathy or status as a golden child does not make your response remotely okay. The only thing you did was stoop to her level. Hell, I'd argue you went lower, because Isla is actually be able to understand the threat - yes, *threat* \\- you made towards her, while Cleo can't as she was a cat.\n\nI am truly sorry for the loss of your cat. It is always heartbreaking to lose a family member and grief affects everyone differently, but grief is NEVER an excuse to threaten your living family members.\n\nYour mom is right, you need professional help.", "NTA for cancelling. But you were both awful about what you said to each other. You should apologize for what you said and be done with the drama. You do not need to forgive your sister", "NTA, and I am so sorry you are dealing with your mom and sister while trying to grieve your sweet baby.", "People who have no human children often consider their fur babies as their kids.  There is a great emotional interaction between the human and pet.  Before my child was born, I had a cat that was my baby.  She was my whole world and she helped me through two bad breakups, several family deaths, college, loneliness and holidays without family.  I was devastated when I lost her.  \n\nIn this case I think both said things that were hurtful.  Both were defending their child. Both need to apologize.  Mom on the other hand needs to stay out of it.", "Nta. Grief sucks. Losing a pet\u2026 sucks.  Unfortunately your sister obviously did not care for Cleo and technically should apologize first. But you should still own up an apologize. Cause you still love your niece.", "i was initially gonna say N T A, but after your last statement, i\u2019m gonna go with ESH\n\ni\u2019m very sorry for your loss, i truly am. but what you said to your sister was totally uncalled for. i do also agree that your sis said the wrong statement at the wrong time, she shouldn\u2019t have talked bad about your cat when you were grieving\n\ncall your sister, apologise for what you said, and explain how your words hurt you.", "YTA\n\nYou guys were both rude to each other so I\u2019m going to ignore that part.  But you canceling on someone last minute for babysitting because your cat died is pretty rude and a poor excuse.\n\nKeeping a child alive is not that difficult people do it all the time after spouses, children, pets etc die.  What you did canceling the promised childcare is very selfish.", "I\u2019ve also lost pets that were incredibly painful, and it was mean of your sister to say those things. But to compare that to losing a child? You are so wrong. And to threaten to run over a child? If I was your sister, you\u2019d no longer be allowed anywhere near my kids. Get help. YTA", "NTA\n\nYou said something you definitely shouldn't have, but people say crazy things sometimes when they're in shock, and all the people here acting like you were seriously threatening your neice are just being ridiculous. Obviously you were just yelling back out of anger and weren't literally threatening to run over someone with a car.", "NTA, Helen needs to learn how to speak to people. You do not need to apologize, or if you do say that although you don\u2019t wish actual death on your niece, the anger you felt was real and you do not regret how you felt. \n\nI am so sorry about your baby, I hope you and your boyfriend are doing at least slightly okay. Cleo was lucky to have you both.", "ESH. Your sister is an asshole, but so are you both for flaking and for THREATENING TO HIT THE CHILD WITH A CAR??? I get that it was hyperbolic but christ.  You are an adult.  Act like it. \n\nAlso, jfc a cat is not the same as a kid. Losing a cat is categorically nothing at all close to losing a child. I get that you're grieving but have some respect.", "ESH, but I don't think you're in the wrong to stand your ground for an apology. Both of you said unforgivable things but the only provocation your sister had was being mad that her plans were changed. You were vulnerable, having one of the worst days of your life, and she struck in a nerve in a very cruel, selfish way and you lashed out. That doesn't make what you said okay - it was AWFUL - but I get it.", "ESH but you suck more then your sister. That comment is extremely out of line. If you were my sister, I\u2019d thank you for letting me know your not someone I\u2019d want watching my kids anymore.

I was going to say N T A until you brought up hitting your niece with your car to prove a point. You\u2019re a sick ass person and maybe so is your sister but to say that.. I wouldn\u2019t ever trust her with that niece if you were my sister. You need help.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister said something horrible and found out that if you push people, sometimes they snap and say horrible things back. \n\nMaybe this will be a lesson for her.", "NTA, it was a question not a threat.", "ESH... what a stupid thing for her to say. You can expect her to be upset at the sudden unraveling of plans but your backing out was not unreasonable\n\nI understand you went crazy but the ilsa comment went over 5he line.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. Take time to heal. Dont hurry to fix things. As the peace and quiet is therapeutic", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing wrong, my condolences for the poor kitty", "So Helen is the golden child.

Yes she shouldn\u2019t have said it but she will possibly NEVER trust you around her child again and possibly not even speak to you again after that. It\u2019s a horrifying thing to hear as a parent.", "ESH yes all of you even your mother.\n\nHonestly I think that's it for the relationship between you, your sister and your niece whether or not you apologize. I'm sorry your cat died, I'm sorry your sister is such an ass she couldn't simply say \"I'm sorry and I understand why you can't take her\" but you?? Holy shit. I would never want you anywhere near my child again after you basically threatened to kill her. I would *never*be able to trust you around her again.\n\nSo apologize or don't, like I said I dont think it matters. That relationship is dead.", "In this story everyone suck.

You especially", "ESH - I only recently realized that means everyone sucks here, for the longest time I thought it meant equally shared hole. Anyway. The loss of a pet and in such a sudden way, doesn\u2019t leave any time to grieve and is such a shock to your system I bet. My pet died a decade ago from chronic illness and I still think of her. It makes sense you were in shambles and couldn\u2019t babysit. your sister was not empathetic because she was looking forward to her trip and probably needed one desperately having a baby, so she was trying to think of whatever dumb reason to say it was a good thing your cat died. She\u2019s kind of an idiot. But you went off the rails. And what you said was way over the line. Like it\u2019s unhinged to threaten to kill your niece, even if it wasn\u2019t serious, how can you even say that?! You should def apologize for that and take responsibility regardless of what she ever says.", "ESH. Your words to each other were very ugly, on all sides. And yes it\u2019s an AH move to cancel childcare last minute for people counting on you like that. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. Pets are family.", "ESH but like what the actual f.

Ew.", "ESH I love my cats but holy gees threatening to hit your niece with a car (who one would think you love too but I guess not!)? Get a grip lady. Your sister was inconsiderate and you were fine to cancel but you need to think about your reaction and apologize.", "ESH. You don\u2019t have to apologize for being angry, but should probably apologize for \u201cthreatening\u201d to run your niece over with your car.", "ESH, but threatening to kill your niece? You do need help. RIP kitty", "YTA you basically threatened to run over your niece with a car.....are you a psycho? Your mom was completely right. You were rude...and that's putting it kindly imo. I also think you were right to refuse to baby sit. You are emotionally unstable. You aren't fit to mind kids.\n\nIt was a cat..... In comparison to a human child a cat should be less than nothing..... yer your pet died and it's ok to be sad about it but you over reacted big time. How could you say such things about your niece....you might need professional help. You don't like your cat being called blood thirsty but you admit it wasn't a friendly cat. You want your sister to apologize for accurately describing your cat or you won't apologize for making death threats....... you are sick in the head.\n\nI think this situation is a kind of good thing. Makes your sister question weather or not her child is safe with you. Now she might be less likely to want you to baby sit for her. This might be an extreme take but I wouldn't trust you to care for kids. I don't think you should ever have kids. Just keep adopting stray animals.", "YTA Big time", "[deleted]", "ESH I doubt this relationship is salvageable because you and your sister both said unforgivable things.

She was frustrated and blindsided with no childcare plans for a pet that's attacked her daughter before. I love my pets, but if I didn't trust my cat around my daughter, I can't deny it'd be a relief not to have to worry about that anymore. \n\nYour mom is right, on all counts. Your sister should apologize, but you should beat her to it. Your comment was unhinged and absolutely NOT okay or normal. Maybe your sister isn't the only one with empathy problems. \n\nI have to tell you, that isn't a comment I'd ever forget, and I'd never trust you around my kid again.", "Esh\n\nYikes, I could never say that about my niece(s) to my brothers, no matter how mad I am with them.", "ESH but mostly you.

But she was out of line too, obviously.", "Eh\u2026 I\u2019m going with NTA. Unless you\u2019re an unhinged person with a history of violence against people, I think any rational person could use comprehension to realize this wasn\u2019t a threat that you actually have any motivation to do. Your callous golden sister displayed zero sympathy for the sudden loss of your beloved pet, actually expressing glee at the fact of it because she gives absolutely zero fucks about the impact of this on you, instead comments about how happy she is for herself, when you\u2019ve just told her what happened and that you were too upset to watch your niece. Your comment was extreme but you were very upset, and you were trying to get her to understand how you felt by trying to create an analogy of her losing her daughter suddenly.\n\nPersonally, I think that anyone that twists that into thinking that you now possibly have a literal agenda to go out and run your niece over is just being a bit obtuse. Unless, of course, you have a history of hurting people, esp physically, to get back at them if they\u2019ve hurt you in some way.\n\nGrief is grief and loss is loss. At the end of the day, it is you that have lost something very significant in your life very suddenly, very traumatically. I personally think others should give you some grace, especially after they say something as horrible as she did.\n\nIf I had to give an apology, it would be super passive aggressive, \u201cI am sorry that you have zero empathy skills to understand how devastating it is to lose something you love that you actually think it\u2019s okay in your first comment to gloat about how happy it makes you.\u201d\n\nSince she\u2019s been the golden child, how much can I bet that she doesn\u2019t lack empathy skills for other people she actually cares about. She probably just doesn\u2019t give a shit about you especially. IMO mom isn\u2019t helping by refusing to understand that your words weren\u2019t an actual threat, but a statement said in anger to try to get her to understand what you are going through. (Again, if you have a history of doing things, I could much more easily understand their reaction.)\n\nOP, I am so *so* sorry for your loss. I\u2019ve been in your shoes and the untimely death of a beloved pet is so traumatic. Please be gentle with yourself and give yourself lots of time to grieve as you need to.", "Yes you are.  You\u2019re the drama.   It\u2019s a cat. It\u2019s sad but grow up and move on.", "I\u2019d say you\u2019re both AH. I lost my beloved cat, Shadow, to a coyote while I was pregnant with my first and only child in 2021. I was beyond devastated and still think about him often. When my child was born, she had some health issues and had to stay in NICU for some time. The devastation I felt from potentially losing her obliterated any thoughts I had of Shadow during that time. There\u2019s no comparison. When I didn\u2019t have my daughter yet and just lost Shadow, I felt I had lost a piece of my heart. When I thought I was losing my actual human child, I felt a sense of grief I can\u2019t even put into words.

(Sister might quite reasonably not want her to, after what she said).", "Yes, I don\u2019t think this relationship is salvageable. OP\u2019s sister said something unbelievably callous and cruel and OP responded with something completely unhinged and absolutely wrong. Neither one is ever going to forgive the other", "I'm sure you thought you had something there.", "And only one threatened to runover the others child. Seriously wtf. The thing said about the cat is callous and mean, but what she said about her daughter is relationship ending.", "Well you don\u2019t see people giving up children while they grieve for their pets typically.  Do you have an example where this has been the case?  I\u2019m not even down playing the grief of losing an animal but when someone says couldnt I don\u2019t believe them.\n\nEspecially when they then try to use that grief and this subs love of animals to win internet points it\u2019s kind of gross. \n\nDo you really believe that this poster wants to know if their the asshole?  This is about winning an argument with her mom and sister using her dead cat as a bargaining chip.", "You really should be attacking the argument and not the poster.  I\u2019d note you don\u2019t dispute she is capable of watching the 7 year old", "I\u2019ve missed events when my childcare fell through last minute. Leaving your kid with people for a whole weekend is not always replaceable.", "Unpaid is far greater as it\u2019s just your path of friendship at stake as opposed to just contract law.  Though based on the twos behaviour to each other maybe that path wasn\u2019t worth anything.\n\nWhy do you need to grieve without children present.  Many families lose pets to and as far as I aware most continue to raise children during this grieving process.  Pet owners even continue to raise their other pets during this grieving process.\n\nThere is no scenario where the OP is physically or emotionally incapable of caring for a 7 year old.  It\u2019s factually untrue.\n\nHer own mom didn\u2019t even take her side.", "I agree", "You have way too much empathy for the wrong sorts of people, friend.", "Whut? Talking about killing someone is as bad as doing it? Are you high?", "It was obviously rhetorical, whereas the sister was dead serious in her joy that OP\u2019s cat fucking died. Was op out of line? Yup, but the sister was worse. OP isn\u2019t an ah, they\u2019re grieving and were overcome with rage at a horrific comment by the sister. They didn\u2019t even say they weren\u2019t willing to apologize and have said that they know what they said was wrong, they just want an apology from the sister. If OP gives in now, they\u2019ll never get a word of apology from the sister.", "Thank you for this response, it\u2019s given me some things to think over. Is it ok if I use that quoted line? That\u2019s some powerful wordsmanship right there.", "That\u2019s the best response. Make it clear to her sister that the apology does not make her own comments in any way acceptable or excusable, but acknowledging that her own response was wrong.", "Honestly, she needs to apologize and then hang up the phone and not bother with her sister anymore. She clearly feels bad, so she should just bite the bullet and apologize to get it off her conscious. After that I'd just tell the sister take care and hang up. Sister won't apologize because she's unempathetic garbage, you don't need people like that in your life.", "There isn't a chance in hell I'd ever consider free babysitting worth the cost of letting someone around my child who threatened to RUN THEM OVER WITH A CAR to teach me a lesson about their dead pet.", "Had about as much and then some more than you mate.", "What was said about the cat is relationship ending.", "They\u2019re both relationship ending. Why not return fire after someone nukes first?", "I guess you don't have a cat then or any type of pet. They're like family, maybe not the same as your children, but very close. Her sis said she was glad her cat was dead. That's relationship ending to me. I didn't excuse what she said about her niece, but that was in the heat of the moment of her sis saying she was glad her cat was dead, she wasn't in her right mind, while the sister was.\n\nThen the mother gives the one a FREE pass, cuz she's like that.", "You don't see the difference between a child who lives with you, and a child who doesn't but you've just agreed to host them for a weekend as a favor?\n\nYou can't give up your own child (and your own child would also be grieving the loss of a pet), but you can certainly decide you just don't have the ability to host someone else's child. If it was the boyfriend who died or a human member of his family, I don't think anyone would be questioning it, right? (at least I hope not)", "Would you insist that a friend babysit for free after they told you they couldn't because their cat died?", "If it's friendship then by default it's a two-way street, and the friend will understand that even if you might be ABLE to do something, it's not the best thing for you right now.", "The wrong sort of people? You mean children? Yeah silly me, feeling that it's wrong to threaten innocent children.", "You suck and are a ass too", "Absolutely - I would be honored if my words helped in any way. You deserve to have peace about this situation so you can concentrate on grieving Cleo and healing.", "You are entitled to your opinion.", "You are entitled to your opinion.", "I don\u2019t think it matters at all whether they\u2019re babysitting for free. You made the point that since it\u2019s unpaid work it somehow is less significant when canceled. I see it differently, that OP\u2019s cancelation could likely mean her sister doesn\u2019t get to go away at all and is out potentially quite a bit of money.\n\nIf my sister suddenly can\u2019t watch my kid and I have to cancel going to the movies, I\u2019m slightly disappointed. \n\nIf my sister suddenly can\u2019t watch my kid and I have to cancel a nonrefundable caribbean cruise, I\u2019m disappointed and fairly upset. \n\nIf my sister suddenly can\u2019t watch my kid and I have to cancel my million dollar trip into space, I\u2019m rather angry.\n\nBoth sides of the story merit consideration.", "This. A real friend would say \"Oh no, I'm so sorry for your loss, I completely understand\" and make other plans. Even if it's inconvenient. Even if it's expensive.", "I mean the sort of people that would say \u201cI\u2019m glad your family member died, I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nThe child is completely uninvolved in the situation. All that happened was the mother fucking around and finding out.", "You are *an* idiot and need to learn the difference of when to use a vs an.", "Again, that's just making crap up. You have no idea if they lost money. Cool story bro, you should make your own post.", "Probably not.  The real friend would step up and babysit.", "This. The only innocents here are the child and the poor cat. But expressing not only complete lack of sympathy but GLEE at someone else's tragedy...that is the mark of a person who definitely does not deserve to have any nice favors done for them like free babysitting.", "My point is that the commitment to babysit deserves consideration here, rather than your statement that because OP wasn\u2019t being paid to babysit there is no loss when she reneges. \n\nThere is loss on the other side, to what degree is unknown.", "I'm talking about the selfishness of a fake friend who values What Can You Do For Me, over the feeling of the friend who had just gone through a tragic loss. The sister should have made other plans without complaining. That's what I would do for someone I cared about who had promised me a favor but couldn't follow through for tragic circumstances.", "So exactly what level of inconvenience would make what the sister said acceptable?"]}
