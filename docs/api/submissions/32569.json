Never neglected my mom and cooked recipes, kept entertaining her tantrums. My mom has thrown her anger and frustration after dad on me ,i have silently cried and taken it all, also she has used abusive words i swallowed everything. Now I m completely burned out, my career has not even started. I want to go to a small vacation to relieve my stress because it's getting difficult to face each day and continue with the care giving task as well household chores. I told my mom about the same but she started abusing me to get out of the house no nurse will be called if u go for vacation.i cant just leave her and go.

You are an adult and a human being and should get some level of respect. Your mother may be angry and frustrated and scared etc etc etc, but it doesn't give her the right to be emotionally abusive.", "NTA. I hope some other commenters have more suggestions for solutions. It will be a struggle, but you need to start lining up relief caregivers to test out to see if they can handle your Mom's disposition and situation.\n\nThink of it this way: if you're hospitalized, or end up in a car accident, who will take care of your Mom? You could be declared at fault if you don't have a backup plan and your Mom is home-bound and dependant on a caregiver for normal life functions. I would start poking around your state laws an aid agencies and seeing what kind of care support services and service placement agencies there are.", "NTA\n\nYou need to reach out to your local government for support. If you don't know whom to contact, make an appointment with your/your mother's GP/family doctor or a local/national patient organisation for people with this condition. You need help. It is not reasonable to be expected to spend your whole life caring for a disabled family member without any funding or help from the state. You are right, your career has not even started, and it won't until you can actually get a paid job.\n\nPlease reach out to people for help. Where is the rest of your/your mother's family?", "NTA. caregiver burnout is a real thing. Go on your vacation. Maybe it\u2019ll recalibrate things for both you and your mom, and maybe she can learn some gratitude in your absence", "Info:  Did your dad leave behind enough wealth to hire a caretaker?\n\nIs your mom completely unable to do anything for herself anymore?\n\nEDIT\n\nYour mom is understandably in a shitty situation.  The frustration and agony will continue to build and she will take it out on you.  At the same time, your frustration will also build and resentment will continue to build.\n\nIt may be time to have a serious conversation with your mother about the future. There may be a way to get government funded help.  Because you need to *start* your life.  The fact that you've done this for 6 years is amazing on its own.  A big part of being a parent is giving a child the love and tools they need to not just survive in this world, but to be *happy* in it.  And as a parent, the fact that I could be the one holding them back from just *beginning* their life would be the most heart breaking part of it all.\n\nNo One Is The Asshole Here.  But something needs to change before nothing remains but resentment and regret.", "NTA. You should hire the appropriate help regardless of what your mother says. If she then turns them away when you are off on your well deserved vacation that is completely her own fault and not yours. When you come back home you should keep the help on for at least 2 days a week if you can at all manage it. It is unreasonably hard on you to be your bedridden mother's only carer. Maybe you shouldn't be her carer at all. There are other options and 6 years is a very long time. You are entitled to a life of your own. You have a lot of things to think about.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I'm not a lawyer, so grain of salt and all that.

The comments on here are exactly how to proceed. The other issue seems to be you and your mother are stuck in the grieving process. With her outbursts and your depression it\u2019s not going to get any better. Your mother is angry her health has become far worse than when she suddenly lost her husband. She probably doesn\u2019t want a caregiver because she is embarrassed a stranger will see her in a very personal manner. You are sad and rightly so. You are burn out because you have worked very hard to fill the void of your father\u2019s passing. You are a good person. Regardless, you don\u2019t have to take on the burden yourself anymore. You deserve to live your best life. Good luck"]}
