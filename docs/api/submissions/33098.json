I drew my one coworker's wife, Hannah. \n\nI've met her a few times and had some conversations with her, and I knew she likes to read. I have a sister who also likes to read, so I asked her what books were popular, and then asked Hannah's husband if he thought she would like that gift. He thought it was a good idea, and fit the budget of $20.\n\nNow I had recently moved into a new place, and still had a bunch of boxes. I thought it would be good fun to wrap her gift as a box within a box within a box. So we get together for Secret Santa, we exchange gifts, I hand her the big box, she unwraps to find another smaller box, etc. but eventually she gets to the book, and although I hadn't noticed at the time, others told me she was very obviously displeased with that gift. \n\nSome time later, we are getting together and we tell our coworker that he should bring Hannah along. He reveals to us that Hannah hasn't gotten over when I \"humiliated\" her at Christmas. I have no idea what he's talking about, but he clarified that her having to unwrap several boxes to get her gift was embarrassing to her. She felt as well that we weren't \"close enough\" to pull a joke like that on her, which I didn't think there was an appropriate level of closeness for something like that, it's just a harmless joke in my eyes. However, we're doing Secret Santa again this year, and she has refused to participate in that or any social hangout I've been a part of since then. \n\nSo AITA for humiliating my coworker's wife by wrapping her gift in several boxes?", "created_utc": 1702646507, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18izyli/aita_for_humiliating_my_coworkers_wife_on/", "score": 113, "replies": ["NTA\n\nWhilst I would generally agree that playing practical jokes, even mild ones, is something you should avoid with a casual acquaintance, this one was so incredibly minor and her reaction is so excessive that I can\u2019t reasonably call you the AH here.", "NTA. Humiliation is not the correct word for what she experienced, and it\u2019s ridiculous to act like having to unwrap several boxes was a hugely negative experience for her. I\u2019ve pulled the same joke at company white elephants and no one has ever had a problem", "NTA Pranks are common in secret santa events. If not the wrapping then the gift. If she was sensitive the husband should have gave you a heads up to make things simple.", "NTA.  Unless Hannah had a physical disability/dexterity issue that makes opening boxes difficult, I fail to see how this is humiliating.", "I\u2019ll go against the grain and say NAH. Hannah is obviously really sensitive to having all the attention on her. Some people love that, some people hate it. You took a gamble and it didn\u2019t pay off. I don\u2019t think that makes you the asshole, but maybe be a little more cognizant in the future that not everyone finds even light-hearted pranks funny.", "NTA\n\nPerfectly normal secret Santa joke. I have seen this multiple times and even had it done to me.   It's a joke that's all.", "Ehhhhh NAH or light YTA. You weren\u2019t an \u201casshole\u201d but it was a bad move to play a prank on an acquaintance. I\u2019d also be pissed off if someone I wasn\u2019t friends with tried to pull that on me\u2014not outraged or \u201chumiliated,\u201d but irritated and annoyed, both by being made to go along with someone\u2019s joke and by the level of familiarity they think they have with me that I don\u2019t reciprocate. \n\nPeople have different opinions on pranks\u2014to you it was harmless, but to her it was embarrassing, frustrating, and (likely) immature. It may even seem, to her, like you\u2019re the type of person who doesn\u2019t care who you\u2019re pranking and will pull the \u201cit\u2019s just a prank!\u201d when called out by the people who don\u2019t find it funny.\n\nSome people just don\u2019t like to be pranked, and it\u2019s not wrong of them to dislike those jokes or feel embarrassed by them. It\u2019s why it\u2019s always better to prank people when you *know* how they\u2019ll react or you *know* they find pranks funny. \n\nNot really an asshole, just that your style of joke doesn\u2019t mesh with hers and you weren\u2019t close enough to her to know that before pulling the prank. A mistake, but not malice", "YTA\n\nYou don't have that kind of relationship with Hannah to pull off that kind of joke. And yes, there is a level of closeness necessary to pull it off.", "INFO How many boxes did she open before getting to the book?", "YTA - you took a thoughtful gift and turned it into a spectacle. You reversed the gift from something for her into a gift for yourself, i.e. the enjoyment of pranking someone.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised it was embarrassing for her, but I am surprised that you aren\u2019t more embarrassed. If I were in your shoes I would apologize.", "NTA - I would have laughed but apparently not everyone would. There was no malicious intent.", "I\u2019m going soft YTA here. You clearly don\u2019t know her that well. It\u2019s usually understood, especially when in public, to play it safe and not do something that the other person might be annoyed by or find embarrassing. If this had been your coworker who you seem to know decently well? It\u2019s probably fine. But it\u2019s not something you do to someone you hardly know, you should have asked her husband what he thought about doing something like that as well. That said, her reaction is a tad over the top.", "NTA. If she is too sensitive to handle basic social situations she should excuse herself from future events, which she has. She solved the problem for everyone, leave it at that.", "NTA. It's actually funny lol. I legit got a gift inside boxes and it was hilarious. \n\nIt's far from humiliation and if Hannah is so sensitive and boring, she can sit her ass at home.", "YTA. Anna is not your friend like that to pull a joke on her. I don't blame her for not coming to any events that you will be in attendance to. It's a joke you should have pulled on a real friend or family member, not your co worker wife.", "YTA, you pranked someone you didn\u2019t know and now are acting like all bullies do when called out, \u201cbut it was just a joke\u201d.", "YTA. That's a coworker's wife, not even the coworker himself and even he is not a friend you can pull such pranks on.", "NTA she has issues if she was \u201chumiliated\u201d by the box in a box in a box. I don\u2019t personally play practical jokes on people I\u2019m not close to, but yours was totally harmless.\n\nMy cousin is way higher on the scale of holiday gift pranks! He gave his supervisor latex finger cots for Hanukkah. They are buddies though.", "YTA. There is a time and place for everything. You have to get a grasp on social boundaries.", "NTA\n\nYou had no idea she would find that humiliating. I myself would have find it funny (and already did something like that, no one was ever offended so I'm also surprised). Although, even if it wasn't your intention to humiliate her, she did feel this way, so, did you apologize? You couldn't have known, but an apology would be a nice gesture.", "NTA, but if you made me open a bunch of boxes within boxes, the gift at the end better be worth it! Lol", "NTA I abhor pranks but this one is so mild I really think she needs to relax. She could\u2019ve told you on the day that she didn\u2019t enjoy it and then moved on, avoiding you entirely is excessive and childish.", "I\u2019m sorry, but you were the AH to pull a prank on what is considered a stranger.\n\nWhile Hannah\u2019s reaction is WAY out of proportion, you still owe an apology.\n\nESH", ">However, we're doing Secret Santa again this year, and she has refused to participate in that or any social hangout I've been a part of since then.\n\nBetter off.  Maybe when she removes the stick from her own ass, she can attempt socialization with others.  What an over reaction...", "NTA!\nBut sometimes it's alright to be the bigger person & apologize.  Sometimes an apology is not about being right or wrong. Sometimes it's about keeping the peace...especially over something so harmless...", "ESH\n\nGiving \"funny\" gifts to someone you barely know is awkward and you should know better.\n\nHannah is being overly dramatic and needs to get over herself.\n\nIf you want to resolve this, you should reach out to Hannah, explain your PoV and apologize.", "Whaaat?? Obviously NTA. This is completely standard and normal way to wrap gifts in a fun way and is in no way \"embarrassing\" to the person opening the gift. Unless people were making fun of her while she was unwrapping it or making rude comments about it I truly do not understand how that could be perceived as \"embarrassing.\" Is the wife from another country than where you live? Perhaps she is unfamiliar with with this practice??  \n\nAlso regardless of if the whole things was embarrassing for her or not, to go so far as to not come to events you're at anymore (rather than talking to you about how it made her feel) is insanely petty and immature.", "NTA she's humiliated herself", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
