{"id": 4203, "submission_id": "zfinb1", "title": "AITA for asking my boyfriend to lose weight?", "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 2 years now. We first met in a gym. He was muscular, committed to exercise and health, and knowledgeable. When we first met, I was just beginning to go to the gym as part of an ED recovery process, and he helped me out a ton. I'm still healing from my ED mentally but, physically, I'm doing fine and a lot of my progress is due to him. Plus, it helped that I found him really handsome.\n\nIn the past few months, my boyfriend scored a new position at his job, and it's been really stressful for him. It takes up a lot of his time and energy and, as a result, he doesn't have much time for the gym. He has been eating a lot more fast food, too. And I believe he's eating more to cope with the extra stress. It's caused him to lose a lot of his muscle mass and gain extra fat. He currently has a dad-bod and will probably continue to gain weight at the rate he's going.\n\nI don't have much of a problem with him being less attractive to me physically. It bugs me a bit, but I've been experiencing a lot of distress just being around him. Even though I don't like it, I know this distress and intense emotions are linked to my ED history and my past traumas. And weight loss won't be easy for him, but I think he's more than capable of a good attempt considering his history. A few days ago, I asked him if he was considering losing weight. He said, \"Maybe,\" so I told him that I really would like him to. I explained everything I was feeling, too. He said that I had no right to ask him to change his body and that it's none of my business and I shouldn't care. He called me an AH for even bringing up his weight gain in the first place. I want to know if I was in the wrong for having this request.

It\u2019s fine to encourage your partner to move their body and eat nutritious foods. It\u2019s fine to express concern for their physical and mental health. It is not fine to tell your partner to lose weight. \n\nTalk to a counselor or therapist about your ED and how his habits are triggering you. Placing blame on him for your triggers and making HIS body tied to your ED is unfair and unhealthy individually and for your relationship. \n\nBodies change and habits change. If you\u2019re concerned about his health then encourage him to go to a doctor. You don\u2019t have the right to tell someone to change their body though.", "YTA.\n\nThe way you phrase this makes it seem as if it\u2019s more related to your trauma rather than his physical or mental health.\n\nYou are blaming his weight for your stress. You are asking him to maintain a certain body type for your well-being. You are asking him to do that for you and not for his own sake. \n\nAs someone who is recovering from ED, how do you not realize how damaging that can be?\n\nHe can be a part of your support system but your recovery is not his responsibility. Please go talk to a therapist to help you manage this in a healthy way.", "YTA.  I'm sure the first thing you learned in ED treatment is not to comment on other people's bodies.  Your concerns for his health are valid.  That would have been the appropriate way to bring it up.  \"Hey, Joe.  I see your new job is stressing you out.  I'm worried it's affecting your health.  I'd be happy to help you with meal planning and stuff so you don't need to eat out all the time.\"", "YTA. ED or no ED if I was your boyfriend I'd dump you on the spot.\n\nReverse the genders and there would be a \\*giant\\* pile-on if a guy wanted his GF to drop some pounds because she'd gotten chubby. I understand your ED has given you some unhealthy attitudes towards weight and food but you have no right to inflict that on your boyfriend.\n\nIf his weight distresses you that much, do him a favor and leave him. So much YTA.", "The N A Hs kill me. If the roles were reversed and BF asked GF if she was going to lose weight people would lose their sh*t.\n\nYTA for telling him you want him to lose weight.\n\nAs others have said if you want to support him in the health aspect and approached it that way it would be different.", "So what I\u2019m reading here is, you don\u2019t care about your boyfriend\u2019s apparent stress levels that have likely contributed to his weight gain. All you care about is that he is less attractive to you, and it\u2019s triggering to you and your issues. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\"It bugs me a bit, but I've been experiencing a lot of distress just being around him.\" Sounds like it's bugging you alot. Which makes it a You issue, not him.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA mostly for the way you addressed the problem. Gaining a lot of weight in a short amount of time is definitely not good for your boyfriend, just like overeating as a way to cope with stress, and you\u2019re also allowed to find your partner less attractive than he used to be. \n\nBut you made the whole thing about you. If his behavior towards food triggers your anxiety, it is up to you to get in contact with a professional to deal with it. It sounds like it\u2019s more about you than your boyfriend\u2019s health. \n\nAnd lastly, he\u2019s also allowed to be upset about your request. He most definitely has noticed his increase in weight, and I doubt he is happy about it. \n\nFirst of all, I think you should apologize to him for the way you approached him. After that, if you are genuinely concerned about his health, find a better way to tell him that his recent behavior worries you. And for the love of God speak to a professional about your, probably unresolved, issues with your ed.", "YTA. You're both projecting your issues onto him, and holding him responsible for your mental health. Neither are fair. If you still struggle with your ED, you need therapy. If him gaining weight triggers you, that is strictly your issue to deal with and find a healthy way to cope. Telling him to lose weight is not the solution.", "YTA- Your boyfriend is probably in a high-stress situation and has had a sudden change in his body type, and instead of asking him if he's alright, if he needs any support, you ask him to lose weight? I can't imagine how hard it is to have your boyfriends body causing emotional distress, but your response points to a lack of empathy for what he's going through. Seek out counseling if you need it, but bringing up his weight gain and ignoring the root of it is rude.", "YTA - just because you have ED trauma doesn\u2019t make it okay for you to body shame someone else. Actually it makes you even more of an AH because you should know how sensitive someone\u2019s weight and body image can be. Shame on you. \n\nHe is working hard in his new role and is stressed out and you choose to swoop in and make him even more stressed. If I were him, you would be gone from my life pretty quick.", "Hard YTA. Your ED does not excuse your rude and unasked for criticism of your partners body. That is a YOU problem. You know you have unrealistic and unhealthy perceptions of what human bodies should look like and yet you\u2019re imposing your mental illness on your unsuspecting partner. \n\nYou should up your therapy and focus on yourself.", "YTA. As someone with history of ED, you should know how unacceptable it is to do something like this.\n\nYou don\u2019t even mention being concerned about his well-being- it\u2019s all about how it affects you. You\u2019re self absorbed, and you need to learn that not everything is about you. \n\nHopefully he will find someone else who cares about him.", "He's not wrong. If it was causing actual health concerns about HIS health I'd say talking to him would be ok but as it sounds like you are putting him as the center of your own issues. It's one thing to ask your partner for support while you deal with your own issues, it's another to make them be the foundation of you dealing with them.", "YTA,\n\nIt's nice that you \"don't have much of a problem with him being less attractive to me physically\" but your motives for asking him to change are still for yourself. For your stress and emotions. You can and should decide whether to be in a relationship based on those self-focused factors, but you shouldn't ask people to change for you on that basis.\n\nThe only thing that should influence someone to encourage their partner to make a change like that is concern for the welfare of the other person. And that comes with suggestions that have no guilt attached (i.e., you don't ask them to do it *for you*)", "As someone who also has a ED who hasn\u2019t recovered yet, what makes you think it\u2019s anywhere near okay to mention someone\u2019s weight??? I doubt you\u2019d feel secure with yourself if you\u2019re boyfriend said he wanted you to lose some weight so he can be comfortable around you. YTA big time, especially with the fact that you have a ED (unless you\u2019re one of those ppl that excuse their fat-phobia due to  their ED)", "YTA - he\u2019s right, you don\u2019t have any right to ask him to change his body.", "YTA   \n I understand you've got your own very serious issues surrounding this topic and I don't want to sound like you shouldn't take steps to address them. But you talk about his problems only in terms of how they effect you. He's so stressed his mental health is effecting his physical health. That sucks for him! You've got to seriously consider if you're able to be an effective partner right now or what you need to do to be both healthy and supportive to someone in the future.", "YTA.  I don\u2019t want you to take that as a reason to beat yourself up, because I *do* think you\u2019re trying your best to figure out what the right thing here is, but\u2026\n\n> I know this distress and intense emotions are linked to my ED history and my past traumas.\n\nYeah, that *really* doesn\u2019t sound like the healthiest reason to try and push your partner to focus on *their* weight. Not to mention that if he\u2019s really gone from \u201cripped\u201d to \u201cdad bod\u201d in the span of just a few months, it sounds like the ripped maybe wasn\u2019t built on a sustainable regimen to begin with, and he needs to actually address why the stress has made him throw everything out the window before he pivots back to the other extreme.", "YTA - You blaming his weight gain for your stress and past trauma is unfair and manipulative. If you are still dealing with this so strongly then you need more counseling.\n\nYou admitted you're not really attracted to him. Maybe it's time to do some soul searching to really figure out what your motives are for him losing weight. BTW....your behavior is no different than a man who fat shames a woman. Yes I said it and I mean it.", "Yikes. I hope you're talking this stuff out with a counselor or something. If you're being triggered by his weight gain then you're going to have even more issues relating and being sympathetic to his situation", "YTA for body shaming. Do that man a favor and break up with him. He deserves someone better.", "YTA - You don't seem remotely interested in his wellbeing, just your own selfish desire to project your ED onto someone else - wow!", "YTA. If his body and its changes are causing you distress, then it sounds like you need to work through that with your therapist, not ask him to lose weight. But you should know that whatever relationship you end up in, whether with him or someone else, people\u2019s  bodies change as they both get older and deal with health issues. So this is something you are going to want to work through at some point. No one, your boyfriend included, owes you weight loss.", "YTA. Yikes indeed", "YTA. He\u2019s stressed out and eating is helping him to cope with it. I\u2019m sure already that he feels like crap for gaining the weight. He didn\u2019t need you to make him feel worse. You know he\u2019s capable of losing it, so he will when he\u2019s ready.", "YTA. Support and encourage. If a male said to his gf what you\u2019re here doing, he would be given the \u201cpositive body image\u201d lecture, etc. Support him or leave him.", "YTA.  If you really cared about him, you would be less focused on his weight and more focused on helping him in a busy and stressful time.", "YTA\n\nUnless you're a doctor, don't tell someone that they need to lose weight.\n\nIf you really want your boyfriend to be in a healthier place, maybe talk to him about how you can help him deal with the stress that's led to him eating; because if that isn't dealt with, nothing else is going to stick (and that's before you take into account the fact that stress literally makes it more difficult to lose weight).", "YTA You cast yourself as the main character in your boyfriend's stressful situation. Given your experience with ED, your lack of empathy is astounding.", "YTA  \n\"I don't have much of a problem with him being less attractive to me physically\".   \nIf it was coming from a place of care, you would offer support, but this statement to me seems that you're focusing more on his physical appearance rather than his mental state.", "YTA my partner has gained in the last year but I try to encourage him and even though he hasn't done much to fix it, I still love him and tell him how attractive he is all the time. You should have more sympathy having gone through an ED. Commenting on someone's weight can cause one, so why would you do that to him?", "So we can all set our standards for how we expect a partner to look, how we expect a partner to act and how we expect a partner to support us. Those standards may be reasonable to some and not to others.\n\nYour partner is entitled to disagree with you and judge you for your standards.\n\nSo for telling your BF you want him to support you in a certain way or look a certain way you\u2019d be N T A, however, in this instance, you identified that your partner is gaining weight due to stress (eg a mental health issue) and instead of offering him support for managing him mental health, you have piled on and made him feel bad about himself. \n\nYou didn\u2019t have to be the A H but the way you tackled this means YTA.", "YTA. Weight fluctuations are perfectly normal. Dadbods are normal. (Mombods too) All bodies are good bodies. Love him, not his weight. Or leave him and let him be with someone else.", "YTA. Stop projecting.", "YTA. If this were a man posting about his girlfriend, people would be losing their absolute fucking minds right now.  You absolutely, categorically, 100% completely had no right whatsoever to ask him to lose weight, or imply & much less outright tell him that it would be preferential to you. I say this as a (fat) woman also in ED recovery who\u2019s partner had the exact same physique and fitness attitudes as yours, and also had the pressures of life catch up to him in the same way yours did. Your role in this relationship is to support your partner and be there for them when they need you. If you know he\u2019s stressed, why the fuck would you think it\u2019s a good idea to make a comment like that unless you\u2019re a) on the spectrum, in which case, discuss this with your OT as something to work on, or b) you really don\u2019t give a shit about your partner whatsoever. \n\nYour partner deserves so much better.", "YTA from someone struggling with a restrictive ED. He's eating like a normal person and exercising like a normal person. You are making your ED into your boyfriend's burden and pushing disordered behaviors on him.\n\nI'm going on an ED tangent for you, personally, here since it's my expertise.\n\nYou aren't recovered. I'm assuming you have a restrictive ED based off of the points you've listed. You've turned your ED from restriction into a health and exercise addiction, some form of orthorexia. Start working with a dietitian and therapist. You *can* recover and work out, but you're so focused on health and weight that I don't think you're actually recovering, and you need professional oversight to do that in a way that isn't rooted in ED behaviors.", "YTA.  His stress level is a problem, not his weight.   I think you need to address this with your therapist because projecting body dysmorphia onto him is very dangerous for you both.  I hope you apologise profusely to him and try to bring joy into his life instead of shame.", "It sounds like you want your bf to act out the things you would do in the midst of your ED. Don\u2019t make him have one too so you can feel relief. Get more therapy and fix yourself. Yta", "YTA. This is a sudden change in his life clearly caused by stress. If you care about his health and happiness surrounding his appearance, you can try to talk to him about managing his stress, and eat together or suggest going to the gym together again since that also helps relieve stress. \n\nI\u2019m sorry his body is triggering for you, but it\u2019s not your place to tell him he needs to change his body and lose weight. If it\u2019s upsetting for you, that\u2019s something you need to work on yourself (maybe via therapy or something) to learn to work through any triggers and stay healthy yourself.", "Ouch. So, he helped you as you were struggling with the worst of your ED symptoms, and you repay him by telling him his gaining stress weight is unattractive and literally making you sick?\n\nYTA. If you like him at all, you should probably do what you can to fix this. Before he starts to understand that he made a mistake with you.", "YTA", "YTA change this story around to a guy asking his girlfriend to lose weight because he didn\u2019t like that she was getting fat.

Maybe see a therapist because you still have body issues.", "YTA.\n\nYour history with an ED doesn\u2019t mean anyone is responsible for your feelings regarding their weight or eating habits.

But your history with an ED doesn\u2019t give you any right ask him to lose weight because of it.  And although anyone can lose attraction to their significant other your whole attitude regarding watching your significant other\u2019s body change during a stressful time is a bit harsh and I\u2019m wondering if some of it is projection from your own relationship with food and your body.

You\u2019re still going to have the anxiety to deal with the next time this sort of situation comes up if you don\u2019t learn how to manage it and how to live with the fact that other people are going to gain weight sometimes.\n\nAnd unless you have reason to believe he is severely impacting his health and it\u2019s an immediate life or death situation that requires an intervention, his weight and his health are between him and his doctor.

It seems kind of blackmailey and holding him accountable for your health.", "Info:  What did you say as the reasons you want him yo lose weight?", "YTA for most of the reasons already mentioned.\n\nI can\u2019t get over that you said he helped you out a ton when you first met, but rather than now help him when he\u2019s stressed you\u2019re making it all about you. If you\u2019re worried about his health and regular fast food consumption, why not make him some more nutritionally beneficial dinners he can stick in the microwave and eat? Show that same kindness he showed you.", "YTA. As harsh as this is going to sound: your trauma is not his problem to manage. Think if the situation was reversed and he started trying to manage your body. That would be mentally harmful to you, correct. \n\nI would recommend going to therapy (if you aren\u2019t already) and working out why this is bothering you so much that he\u2019s out on some weight. I imagine that you don\u2019t have this same reaction to every overweight person you see? You need to uncover why your mind is doing the things it does.

You have a trauma around weight and food it seems which is fair but you cannot project that onto someone you love especially when they are stressed.  \n\nTo everybody else, why are you being so harsh? Please spare me. If your partner went through a major change physically do not act like you wouldn\u2019t think twice about it. If somebody\u2019s type is dad bods for example and their partner lost significant weight and became far more skinny, they would probably think something by it. Same applies reverse. Some people are into gym rats w that type of physique, if that person lost all their muscle and started gaining an extreme amount of weight, I promise you they would feel some sort of loss of attraction.. that is normal. For all genders alike. If I like dark hair and my bf became bleach blonde, as much as I love him.. I\u2019d be like uhhhhh not my type, because it is not. There is nothing wrong with expressing to a long term partner if you feel a loss of attraction.", "YTA", "Am I the only one who was confused about OP going to the gym to cure erectile dysfunction?", "[deleted]", "NAH -- you expressed your concerns appropriately.

We first met in a gym. He was muscular, committed to exercise and health, and knowledgeable. When we first met, I was just beginning to go to the gym as part of an ED recovery process, and he helped me out a ton. I'm still healing from my ED mentally but, physically, I'm doing fine and a lot of my progress is due to him. Plus, it helped that I found him really handsome.\n\nIn the past few months, my boyfriend scored a new position at his job, and it's been really stressful for him. It takes up a lot of his time and energy and, as a result, he doesn't have much time for the gym. He has been eating a lot more fast food, too. And I believe he's eating more to cope with the extra stress. It's caused him to lose a lot of his muscle mass and gain extra fat. He currently has a dad-bod and will probably continue to gain weight at the rate he's going.\n\nI don't have much of a problem with him being less attractive to me physically. It bugs me a bit, but I've been experiencing a lot of distress just being around him. Even though I don't like it, I know this distress and intense emotions are linked to my ED history and my past traumas. And weight loss won't be easy for him, but I think he's more than capable of a good attempt considering his history. A few days ago, I asked him if he was considering losing weight. He said, \"Maybe,\" so I told him that I really would like him to. I explained everything I was feeling, too. He said that I had no right to ask him to change his body and that it's none of my business and I shouldn't care. He called me an AH for even bringing up his weight gain in the first place. I want to know if I was in the wrong for having this request. Thoughts?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "~~Soft~~ YTA. He's obviously really stressed out and now you put an extra burden on him. Try to be more empathetic with him and his situation. I understand that you cannot change what you feel and why, but you should not make that HIS problem, when in fact it is YOURS.

You\u2019ve noted that the weight gain is due to struggles of his own, you should be supportive and understanding.", "YTA, but also - as a person who is also healing from an ED - this is something that you should absolutely be talking to a therapist about.

You won\u2019t be magically fixed by going through recovery. Relationships take work and require mutual love and support.

You\u2019ve at least in part replaced one mechanism with another - and it will not do anything but hurt you more in the long run. You need a therapist you\u2019re comfortable with or if moneys tight  - you need to be attending a support group regularly. Think of yourself as if you\u2019re someone that needs to attend AA meetings - you need to actually show up, be present, and work the steps properly. Shortcuts will inevitably lead you down a dark path again. And Lila AA where a relationship early on in your recovery is a no no\u2026it probably needs to apply to you too for a while. \n\nAlso look for a therapist that meets you where you\u2019re at. That you can tell stuff to and that will actually help you to be a bit better today than yesterday. When I was a law student I used to tell my therapist how stressed long days on campus made me and all the reasons thT food and eating in public and thinking all it food and the reflective mirrors where I used to study during the day all messed with me a lot. And when I responded by skipping even more meals and just not eating  my therapist helped me come up with a plan in response. She helped me give myself permission (she didn\u2019t give it to me, I didn\u2019t ask her for it - she helped me understand and get to this mindset myself) to not stress so much and make a fresh juice for the day instead and eat a dinner that was packed full of good stuff when I got home. Slowly juices became less veggie and more fruits then started adding yogurt and bringing a snack too. If my friend being there as a crutch helped me eat for a week and then I was back to square one the next week when she had the flu I wouldn\u2019t have gotten more comfortable. You need someone to get you there - right now you\u2019re using him as a crutch and getting upset it\u2019s not the same model you wanted earlier"]}
