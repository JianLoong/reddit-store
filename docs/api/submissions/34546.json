{"id": 34546, "submission_id": "1914q3d", "title": "AITA for excluding my ADULT stepdaughter from the holidays?", "selftext": "My stepdaughter Lara had a tough childhood I will admit. Her parents divorced when she was 8 and she never forgave my husband Jim for initiating the divorce. I met her father when she was 10 and at first, we were okay. I never tried to be her mom as she wasn't interested in that. I was more of an aunt figure. That changed when Laras' mom passed when Lara was 13. \n\nIn her grief Lara blamed Jim and me and did her best to ruin us. It got to the point where I feared for the safety of my sons, Laras half siblings, so when Lara was 15-18 me and Jim lived separately. He visited our kids after work and on the weekends and lived with her full time.\n\nI understood & hoped that with time she would get better. We put her in family and individual therapy, but she never participated. Currently Lara is 45 and her attitude hasn't changed. She constantly goes back and forth, sometimes she expects me to act motherly but then gets mad when I do. Some examples:\n\nShe will get mad if I want to take her out for her birthday because \"I'm not her mom\", but then next year gets mad if I don't get her anything. She was vile towards me during her wedding and excluded me from preparations but then got mad at me for going wedding dress shopping with my DIL during my son's wedding. Called me two faced for \"caring more about strangers than her.\" She tells me not to consider her kids my grandkids but then gets mad when I'm closer to my sons' children. I only see her kids during the holidays, I am nice to them but it's natural I am closer with my other grandkids when I am involved in their lives. If I try to get closer with her kids, she yells at me for \"overstepping\". As a result, her relationship with me and my kids is very strained, and we often don't see each other.\n\nA few months ago, my granddaughter from my eldest son got an important scholarship to a new school. I asked her what she wanted as an award, she said she wanted to go to Australia for winter vacation with the family. So, me, my kids and grandkids all planned a trip, we didn't invite Lara as she has refused to join our family vacations since her mom died. We were supposed to come back and celebrate Christmas at home where Lara was going to join us. \n\nWhile we were there Laras kids saw my grandkids pictures on social media and were upset they were the only grandkids left out. Lara called and yelled at me for being a horrible grandma etc. I told her I was NOT her kid's grandma as per her wishes. She said it didn't matter and that I was cruel to exclude them. My final straw was when her kids started posting mean comments under my grandkid's pictures. I had enough to cheer my family up, so I decided to extend our holiday for Christmas & NY as well. Jim was upset and I told him he could go and celebrate with Lara if he wanted.  \n\nSince we got back Laras family and my in laws have been calling us AHs for excluding Lara & her kids. They say we should be understanding of her, but I say we've coddled her enough.
