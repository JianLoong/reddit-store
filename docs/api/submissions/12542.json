As her memory and physical ability started to decline, the family moved her into a home where she is now doing surprisingly well.  Granny probably has dementia but we have not bothered to get a formal diagnosis as it wouldn't change anything in how we care for her.\n\nGranny still uses a walker, but she has been slowly getting weaker over the last several months.  She used to get up independently, but one night she fell off the toilet and was on the floor for a short time, thankfully with no injury.  As she forgets to use the call bell, she has a bed alarm for safety. She also always has someone walk beside her due to the fall risk, and if she goes to the bathroom, a staff member will wait right outside the door for her to finish.  This is because Granny will always **ACCEPT** help, but she will never **ASK** for it.  This is important for later.\n\nMyself (38M) and my brothers (40M, 42M) enjoy taking her to her favorite Italian restaurant.  When we park in a handicapped space and assist her with walking, she manages nicely. \n\nThe last time I took her, she needed to use the bathroom after the meal.  Being aware of her fall risk, I went to the woman's washroom.  I opened the door a crack, asked loudly \"is anyone in here?\" and when there was no reply, took my grandma in.  After assisting her to the toilet, I closed the stall door and stood right outside.\n\nDuring this time a middle-aged woman  walked in and was visibly taken aback by my presence.  I apologized, saying my grandmother was using the bathroom, and that we would be done quickly, and to please feel free to use the facilities.   She walked out without a word.\n\nA minute or so later I took Granny out of the bathroom, walker and all.  The woman was waiting outside for us, and as we left, she went in, muttering loud enough that I should have taken her to the men's washroom if I was there with her.  I said nothing, not wanting to cause any conflict, and took Granny back to the home.\n\nAfterwards this did get me thinking.  I have my grandma's well being first and foremost in my mind, but I certainly don't want to make anyone else uncomfortable by going into a woman's washroom.  My wife and one brother thought I did the right thing, but other family members though I was the AH and looked like a creep.

I don't see how you'd make people uncomfortable when you're visibly there with your very elderly grandmother. It's not like you're on your own or just loitering and telling people you're with your grandmother. I imagine if/when there are disabled stalls you take her to those? If not then you might be better off doing that when possible, both to avoid these situations and because there are handrails and more space so might be easier for her too.

I feel any sane person would understand the situation pretty well and it's not like you guys occupied the washroom for a long time.\n\nI lost my granny who was around 93 and she was bedridden after a nasty fall and deteriorated badly after that.  I might be biased because of your granny and her age.   \n However, personally I think the lady should have kept it to herself because your granny probably heard her as well and it sounded like she was being punished for being old and unable to walk without a walker so she should use men's washroom because her caretaker is a man?!!!.

If a private bathroom was not available, we went into the ladies room.The one time I was prevented from taking my buddy into the ladies room and I was denied entering the men's room we were directed to use the family bathroom across the park. When we arrived we watched an individual who could have used the very accessible gendered bathrooms enter the only bathroom we could use. Otherwise, very few women made comments about the situation because it was clear within ten seconds why we were in the bathroom together. The same can be said of your situation.

A girlfriend of mine has a disabled adult brother and when she is with him takes him into the women's room. Same thing with parents, a father will take his daughter into the men's room and the mother would take her son into the women's room. I personally would be understanding but also not that comfortable if an able bodied man was in the woman's bathroom. I wouldn't be uncomfortable if a female was helping her grandfather, son or other disabled adult. I don't know how to explain it or if I'm even making sense. Maybe it's the vulnerability aspect?
