As her memory and physical ability started to decline, the family moved her into a home where she is now doing surprisingly well.  Granny probably has dementia but we have not bothered to get a formal diagnosis as it wouldn't change anything in how we care for her.\n\nGranny still uses a walker, but she has been slowly getting weaker over the last several months.  She used to get up independently, but one night she fell off the toilet and was on the floor for a short time, thankfully with no injury.  As she forgets to use the call bell, she has a bed alarm for safety. She also always has someone walk beside her due to the fall risk, and if she goes to the bathroom, a staff member will wait right outside the door for her to finish.  This is because Granny will always **ACCEPT** help, but she will never **ASK** for it.  This is important for later.\n\nMyself (38M) and my brothers (40M, 42M) enjoy taking her to her favorite Italian restaurant.  When we park in a handicapped space and assist her with walking, she manages nicely. \n\nThe last time I took her, she needed to use the bathroom after the meal.  Being aware of her fall risk, I went to the woman's washroom.  I opened the door a crack, asked loudly \"is anyone in here?\" and when there was no reply, took my grandma in.  After assisting her to the toilet, I closed the stall door and stood right outside.\n\nDuring this time a middle-aged woman  walked in and was visibly taken aback by my presence.  I apologized, saying my grandmother was using the bathroom, and that we would be done quickly, and to please feel free to use the facilities.   She walked out without a word.\n\nA minute or so later I took Granny out of the bathroom, walker and all.  The woman was waiting outside for us, and as we left, she went in, muttering loud enough that I should have taken her to the men's washroom if I was there with her.  I said nothing, not wanting to cause any conflict, and took Granny back to the home.\n\nAfterwards this did get me thinking.  I have my grandma's well being first and foremost in my mind, but I certainly don't want to make anyone else uncomfortable by going into a woman's washroom.  My wife and one brother thought I did the right thing, but other family members though I was the AH and looked like a creep.  I replied that as a woman, Granny has the right to use a woman's washroom, and as someone who was her caretaker at that moment, I go where she goes for her own safety. \n\nAm I the AH for taking a disabled/handicapped woman to a woman's washroom when I am a man?\n\n(For reference, the restaurant does not have a family or mixed washroom, or I'd absolutely take her there.)", "created_utc": 1679070729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11tw3ay/aita_when_i_38m_take_my_disabled_grandmother_93f/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a FEMALE, your granny has the right to use the women's bathroom and you didn't violate any one else's rights while assisting her. You merely waited outside of the stall until she was done and then left when your granny was done. You didn't do anything inappropriate and you didn't disrespect anyone. The lady and your other family members are overreacting to you simply helping your granny who is a FALL RISK to go to the bathroom safely.", "NTA. You are doing the best you can with the options you have. \n\nThe only additional thing I can think of that might help is to also have one of your brothers posted outside the main door of the bathroom to give women a heads up that you are in there so that they won\u2019t be startled by seeing you.", "NTA. People of the opposite sex are allowed to assist people using their appropriate restroom.", "NTA\n\nThat was very rude towards your grandmother.  \nThis lady expected you to make your grandmother uncomfortable in the men's room so that *she* would not be uncomfortable because of your presence. She was clearly capable of waiting a minute. \n\nThat was ableist and ageist, and you did nothing wrong.", "NTA and your granny is lucky to have such thoughtful, caring loved ones like yourself.", "Nta that lady sucks", "Most importantly, NTA. That woman will wish for a grandson like you when she is older. \n\nNext time, would it be possible to get an employee's attention and explain on your way there? Maybe a staff member can wait outside and explain to other customers. This might encourage places to add family-style restrooms.", "NTA. I don't see how you'd make people uncomfortable when you're visibly there with your very elderly grandmother. It's not like you're on your own or just loitering and telling people you're with your grandmother. I imagine if/when there are disabled stalls you take her to those? If not then you might be better off doing that when possible, both to avoid these situations and because there are handrails and more space so might be easier for her too. But if that's not an option, I think what you're doing is fine.\n\nTaking an elderly woman into a men's restroom where there are urinals feels less respectful of her privacy than you accompanying her into the women's restroom where other women will more often than not understand the context and be fine with it.", "NTA Fellow diner was unreasonable given the context, but I would have expected the restaurant to have a disabled toilet - maybe it's a cubicle and not separate though.", "NTA. If my grandmother was feeling up to going to restaurants when she was wheelchair bound, and there were no women available to help her in the restroom, I would have sucked it up and done what needed to be done.", "I don't think you did any thing wrong under the circumstance.  I would be glad waiting outside knowing a granny was being taken well of.  At her age, any fall are detrimental to her health and it could take her life as well.  You did what you had to do to make sure she was alright and you explained yourself first about the situation.  I feel any sane person would understand the situation pretty well and it's not like you guys occupied the washroom for a long time.\n\nI lost my granny who was around 93 and she was bedridden after a nasty fall and deteriorated badly after that.  I might be biased because of your granny and her age.   \n However, personally I think the lady should have kept it to herself because your granny probably heard her as well and it sounded like she was being punished for being old and unable to walk without a walker so she should use men's washroom because her caretaker is a man?!!!.   Like seriously, we all get old one day.  Have some empathy.", "NTA, I know I\u2019d be shocked to see a man in the women\u2019s restroom but if you told me you were waiting for your elderly grandmother, I\u2019d have no issue and just use the other stall for the reason I came in, to use the restroom or just wash my hands if that\u2019s all I needed", "NTA\n\nI'm a certified nurses assistant who has worked with the elderly for 6 years. It truly warms my heart to hear stories of family members doing whatever it takes to maintain their relative's quality of life.", "NTA.   Might be good to carry a sticky pad and put a sticky on the door when you do this tho so people have heads-up.", "NTA. Why are people so fucking precious about the restroom?", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing.  The only person who had an issue was the middle-aged woman, who will be in your granny's situation before too long.", "NTA she should've been more understanding. If she feels uncomfortable that's fine, but she could just wait her turn and not say anything nasty/rude about it.", "NAH\n\nYou did the right thing. And the woman was likely just startled/shocked and uncomfortable. She has a right to her opinions, and you don't say that she insulted you or complained, so I can't call her an AH.\n\nI agree with one of the other replies, though, that in the future it might be nice (if/when possible) to have one of your other brothers (or an employee) outside the bathroom to warn people in advance!

Good on you.", "NTA and bless you for spending time with your grandmother. A women\u2019s restroom is all stalls so there is always some privacy. Most men\u2019s rooms have urinals. I don\u2019t think Grandma wants to see that. You made the right choice, you cleared the room ahead of going in and you gave the woman trying to enter a very valid reason for being in there. Everybody else needs to butt out.", "NTA. Your grandma is 93 and had every right to use the handicapped women\u2019s restroom. You went in as her caretaker. And you made sure to make your presence known in case anyone was already in there. I saw another comment where someone suggested having a brother stay outside to give others a heads up. I think that\u2019s a good idea.", "NTA. Gendered restrooms are an archaic expression of patriarchy anyway, moreso when disabilities or children are involved. Fuck the patriarchy, keep helping Granny out.", "NTA.  Please never take your grandmother into a men's bathroom if you can help it. They are usually disgusting.  The women's public bathroom can be bad at times, but men's are almost always bad.", "NTA. Men's washrooms are notoriously filthy. Your granny shouldn't be forced to deal with that.", "In the US, disabled toilets are almost always stalls within the regular facilities and not a separate room."]}
