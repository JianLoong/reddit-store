When I moved in, we agreed we would split expenses 50/50. However I expressed I was not comfortable chipping in on large renovations/projects, as there is no guarantee I would ever see a return on money I put into the house. We are not engaged/married and I am not on the deed to the house. I agreed I would split the costs of emergencies (replacement of water heater, washer or dryer, etc) that are needed to allow the house to function. \nI decided to go back to school and my finances have been pretty tight since then. My bf is saying he wants to do a bunch of projects this summer to improve the house, and he feels since I live here, I should pay half. He wants to do things like put in a new cement driveway, possibly update the siding, lay down new grass, etc. Each costing multiple thousands of dollars.\nI told him I don't have the money to pay for these things, and even if I did, why would I put thousands of dollars into a house with no guarantee I'd see a return on that investment.\nHe argues that I have done other cosmetic projects like painting and updating fixtures, so I should be able to help with the large projects. But a can of paint is $50 and new fixtures were about $30, very large cost differences. \nHe also said I should either pay half of the project, or pay more I'm rent so he can save up the extra for the projects.\nWould I be the asshole to put my foot down and tell him no?\n\nInfo: \"pay more in rent\" would mean me paying more than half the mortgage payment each month.

I'll give bf the benefit of the doubt that he's not trying to pull a fast one (though I won't rule it out), but he's sure being unreasonable.

His house, his projects, his wallet.", "Why the heck are you chipping in for a new water heater or washer dryer?\n\nWhat exactly are you paying? First you say \u201csplitting expenses\u201d and then later call it rent. If you are paying rent, your boyfriend is responsible for all the expenses related to the house.", "NTA\n\nYou are getting screwed here. First, I would NOT agree to pay for things like the water heater or the washer/dryer. No way. It's his house and you are not on the deed. So he gets to eat the cost of those things. You are paying him rent and if you decide the rent is too much, you can move out. I wouldn't pay for little projects around the house either. He needs to be using your rent money to pay for those things. They should not be extra expenses you pay for.\n\nThink long and hard about where this relationship is going. Is there a plan for you two to eventually get married and if so, is he going to put you on the deed? Have you two discussed this? If you two aren't headed that way, then I would think carefully about whether you really want to invest time into this relationship. Might be better for you to move out and save up money for your own place where you can build up equity of your own.", "NTA\n\nYou should be paying rent based on renting a room or an apartment, plus utilities.  Not for things like a new driveway or new siding.   Those are on the homeowner.  If he wants you to spend those kinds of big bucks, he can marry you and put you on the deed.", "NTA\n\nHe's basically your landlord, when you break it down into black & white.  Maintenance is not your responsibility unless your relationship progresses further.", "NTA.  Lol your boyfriend is playing you for a fool.", "NTA there is a huge difference between buying some paint for a room and re-paving a driveway. I know someone who just did it that is extremely expensive. I would not be paying for that on a house that my name is not on.", "NTA- oh man there's so much wrong with this picture. You have renters rights. Which is what you are, under a verbal month to month. Look it up. You are only required to pay for half of appliances, only because you agreed, which I wouldn't have agreed to. But legally, NOT the hot water heater, as it is neccessary for habitability. Same with AC/Heat, running water, etc.\n\nMan, he is taking advantage of you big time, and I see no way he will let you in on the deed, not for cheap if so. Most times you don't even have to pay half or any for appliances, like 9 outta 10 times.\n\nI'd dump him, focus on school, and get in a better situation. Renters rights apply here. He's manipulating you into waiving yours, and on da streets, that's illegal.", "Find a new place.", "NTA. You are legally a tenant. There's no reason you should pay for large improvements. \n\nHe can raise your rent, but that goes into relationship issue territory. There should be more discussion, since this is an area that you seem to have different ideas of what's fair. Without agreement and understanding one of you will feel taken advantage of.", "NTA.  Tell him those are options and you are not paying for optional improvements to HIS property.  If he wants money to improve his property then he needs to go get a bank loan.  Move out.  He expects to use you to fund his savings (owned property).  His money is his and your money is his.  Tell him that is not how a partnership is.", "YWNBTA.  Absolutely tell him no.  He is extremely unreasonable to ask you to contribute to major home renovations for a house that isn't yours.  He can put your name on the deed, or he can pay for them himself.", "Plenty of people get permission from a landlord to do things like paint a room or swap out minor things that they enjoy more. No renter I've ever heard pays to add an addition onto a homeowner's house, build a new patio, and set up a big garden on the property. All of those things improve the value of the home, and are things that could be major improvements for the life of the renter, but the benefit is overwhelmingly on the side of the owner, not the renter.\n\nThis situation is effectively the same, it's just that you're dating your landlord. It's not a reasonable expectation that you contribute to his property value... At least not without a contract in place to guarantee that, if you split up or he sells the house, you are entitled to a fair equity amount based on the value you've contributed. eg: if he wants to do upgrades to the home that amount to 10% of the value of the home, and wants you to pay half, you should have a contract in place that states he owes you 5% of the current fair market value/sale price of the home upon the sale of the home or ending of your relationship, something like that.\n\nMoral of the story is there's no way in hell you should agree to this without having a lawyer involved and making a fair contract. NTA", "NTA - you set a boundary when you moved in.  He is attempting to get rid of that boundary now.  You said no because of your finances.  He is still pushing you to say yes.  There is no reason for you to invest in that house more than you do, especially as you won't see a return on investment.\n\nHe should only invest on these if he has the money to cover it himself.", "NTA. You would be a fool to pay for his home improvements. If anyone is the AH then it's your BF.", "I am in his situation. My bf just moved into the house I own and is also an adult who just went back to school. We plan to be together forever and  live in this house. I\u2019m planning a major renovation in the next few years. I would NEVER expect him to put half the money up up front, as this house is my investment and we are not married yet. I plan to take out a home equity loan to make the improvements that are needed and then what he pays me each month toward our living expenses will increase. I feel that\u2019s fair because he will also reap the benefit of the improvements as long as he lives here. But if something happens and we split up, it\u2019s up to me to continue making those payments, because it\u2019s my house. I will not increase his amount to more than he can afford, because I love him and I don\u2019t want to see him struggle. I will add that I lived in a house that was owned and paid up free and clear by my ex husband while we were still married. I put a lot of money into that house and when we divorced, I never saw any of it. So there\u2019s that. Trust your gut. If you have no claim to the house, married or not, you don\u2019t put money into it that you\u2019ll never see again if the relationship fails. Don\u2019t let him tell you otherwise. YWNBTA!!", "NTA, if he wants you to be going halves in renovations then tell him to put you on the deed to the house", "NTA. Renovations are up to the owner of the house regardless of the relationship the owner has with its tenants. Put your foot down or else your BF will take  advantage of you simply because you're living there. If he wants you to pay for half, tell him to put your name on the deed. Otherwise, you have no reason to contribute in terms of renovations to a house you don't own.", "NTA\n\nDo you want to get married to him?  I think that should be when you start splitting all those projects with him.", "NTA - You are exactly right.", "Oh hell no. You are essentially a renter, and helping out by paying (I assume) part of the mortgage (\u201crent\u201d) and half of utilities, food, etc. like a roommate would. If the \u201clandlord\u201d wants to make improvements to the building and grounds, that is on him. You should not be paying anything for maintenance or upgrades. NTA.", "NTA, dump him also", "NTA. Absolutely not. You should absolutely put your foot down. This isn\u2019t fair to you.", "LOL, NTA, the audacity on him is next level. He\u2019s literally gaining equity while you\u2019re just?\n\nMight be time for a new roommate/boyfriend.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, there are a lot of people who would refuse to even pay rent in your situation. I'm not one of those people at all, but even I think its ridiculous to have you pay for reno on a house you don't own.\n\nYou can pay rent, which is fine since you live there. But you don't own the house. He's technically your landlord. He should be paying to fix/repair/reno the house. Its that simple.\n\nPut your foot down and keep it there.", "NTA. If he wants you to pay for these things he can add you to the deed.", "NTA. I would probably move out. If he can\u2019t afford the house, that is not your problem and you should not over-extend yourself to enrich him. You should never have paid for anything to \u201callow the house to function\u201d because that is his responsibility as the owner. You are just a tenant. So you need to simply put the pin in that and if the rent he wants is too high give him notice you are leaving. Because this man does NOT have your best interests at heart. If he can\u2019t afford the upkeep of the house, that\u2019s his problem, not yours. \n\nThe fact that these are all expensive cosmetic projects that he wants to do in one fell swoop while offloading expenses to you while you gain nothing would be a HUGE red flag to me. And then threatening you with a rent increase if you don\u2019t comply would be another. Why does this all have to be done now? This feels like a short term plan that includes you that could all be part of a long term plan that could include you. So why does it have to be so short term, you know?", "NTA. Nope, nope nope. \n\nThis is no different than any other landlord/tenant situation. This is not your house and you should not be expected to pay for renovations.\n\nI\u2019ve been there myself. But now-ex and I were in total agreement about this. I bought furniture and electronics and kitchen stuff. He paid for repairs and improvements. When we broke up I took everything I paid for with me and he continued to enjoy everything he\u2019d done to the house.", "NTA. Move out for a year, let him do his projects, then move back in. This is the way. Do not pay up front for any improvements, not even a rent increase. Rent goes up when projects are DONE, not for a construction zone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I your name were on the deeds or you were married it would be different but you are basically a tenant. I think you need to consider your relationship very carefully and perhaps you should rent your own place for a while or flatshare", "NTA. I also live in my partner's house. I have zero problems replacing small things (replaced both hoses last year, etc) or small projects like painting tile, like you said paint is cheap. But when our washer/dryer eventually dies, they will be replacing it. And when we almost did a big reno last year, it was going to be on them (although they got quite the sticker shock so that's on hold). I have done some landscaping but all the plants are in pots so those can go with me. I'm not getting any equity, so why would I put a ton of money into it?", "NTA. Look, you\u2019re either renting or you\u2019re buying. If you\u2019re renting, then what you pay should be related to the cost of renting half a house in the same neighborhood. That has nothing to do with his mortgage, which is determined by the cost of the house, his down payment & the terms of his loan. Tenants don\u2019t replace appliances, sod or driveways. If you\u2019re buying, then your name should be on the deed & you should pay a share of the repairs & upgrades.", "NTA but you shouldn\u2019t be paying 50% of his mortgage either. This is a look at the rest of your life with this man. Do you want someone who takes without giving back. You said no to paying for large renovations, yet here he is demanding it. You rightfully want an education which will make money tight, but now he wants you to pay more rent so he can make these renovations. What are you getting in return? It doesn\u2019t look like much to me.", "Nope.\n\nA tenant doesn't contribute to major renovation costs...and as it stands, you're no more than a tenant. You pay your half of rent (his mortgage) and your share of bills and utilities...that's the maximum you need to pay and should pay.

He\u2019s literally using you like a piggy bank if he gets you to chip in for anything if you\u2019re paying rent. I rent from my grandparents and they never ask me to pay for a new water heater or washer. I\u2019ve offered to help, but my grandfather said it\u2019s his responsibility as the landlord, and he\u2019s right.

I think paying for things 50/50 isn't necessarily a bad deal provided that it's in line or less with what you'd be paying to live somewhere similar.  Just because one partner has equity doesn't mean the other should live for free.  If you aren't married, that is completely understandable.\n\nHowever, I completely agree that you shouldn't help pay for any of the extras like you mentioned as it isn't your house. It is his.
