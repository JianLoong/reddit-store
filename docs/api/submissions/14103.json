My bf is saying he wants to do a bunch of projects this summer to improve the house, and he feels since I live here, I should pay half. He wants to do things like put in a new cement driveway, possibly update the siding, lay down new grass, etc. Each costing multiple thousands of dollars.\nI told him I don't have the money to pay for these things, and even if I did, why would I put thousands of dollars into a house with no guarantee I'd see a return on that investment.\nHe argues that I have done other cosmetic projects like painting and updating fixtures, so I should be able to help with the large projects. But a can of paint is $50 and new fixtures were about $30, very large cost differences. \nHe also said I should either pay half of the project, or pay more I'm rent so he can save up the extra for the projects.\nWould I be the asshole to put my foot down and tell him no?\n\nInfo: \"pay more in rent\" would mean me paying more than half the mortgage payment each month.

First, I would NOT agree to pay for things like the water heater or the washer/dryer. No way. It's his house and you are not on the deed. So he gets to eat the cost of those things. You are paying him rent and if you decide the rent is too much, you can move out. I wouldn't pay for little projects around the house either. He needs to be using your rent money to pay for those things. They should not be extra expenses you pay for.\n\nThink long and hard about where this relationship is going. Is there a plan for you two to eventually get married and if so, is he going to put you on the deed? Have you two discussed this? If you two aren't headed that way, then I would think carefully about whether you really want to invest time into this relationship. Might be better for you to move out and save up money for your own place where you can build up equity of your own.", "NTA\n\nYou should be paying rent based on renting a room or an apartment, plus utilities.

Maintenance is not your responsibility unless your relationship progresses further.", "NTA.  Lol your boyfriend is playing you for a fool.", "NTA there is a huge difference between buying some paint for a room and re-paving a driveway. I know someone who just did it that is extremely expensive. I would not be paying for that on a house that my name is not on.", "NTA- oh man there's so much wrong with this picture. You have renters rights. Which is what you are, under a verbal month to month. Look it up. You are only required to pay for half of appliances, only because you agreed, which I wouldn't have agreed to. But legally, NOT the hot water heater, as it is neccessary for habitability. Same with AC/Heat, running water, etc.\n\nMan, he is taking advantage of you big time, and I see no way he will let you in on the deed, not for cheap if so. Most times you don't even have to pay half or any for appliances, like 9 outta 10 times.\n\nI'd dump him, focus on school, and get in a better situation. Renters rights apply here. He's manipulating you into waiving yours, and on da streets, that's illegal.", "Find a new place.", "NTA. You are legally a tenant. There's no reason you should pay for large improvements. \n\nHe can raise your rent, but that goes into relationship issue territory.

He expects to use you to fund his savings (owned property).  His money is his and your money is his.  Tell him that is not how a partnership is.", "YWNBTA.  Absolutely tell him no.  He is extremely unreasonable to ask you to contribute to major home renovations for a house that isn't yours.  He can put your name on the deed, or he can pay for them himself.", "Plenty of people get permission from a landlord to do things like paint a room or swap out minor things that they enjoy more. No renter I've ever heard pays to add an addition onto a homeowner's house, build a new patio, and set up a big garden on the property. All of those things improve the value of the home, and are things that could be major improvements for the life of the renter, but the benefit is overwhelmingly on the side of the owner, not the renter.\n\nThis situation is effectively the same, it's just that you're dating your landlord. It's not a reasonable expectation that you contribute to his property value... At least not without a contract in place to guarantee that, if you split up or he sells the house, you are entitled to a fair equity amount based on the value you've contributed. eg: if he wants to do upgrades to the home that amount to 10% of the value of the home, and wants you to pay half, you should have a contract in place that states he owes you 5% of the current fair market value/sale price of the home upon the sale of the home or ending of your relationship, something like that.\n\nMoral of the story is there's no way in hell you should agree to this without having a lawyer involved and making a fair contract.

My bf just moved into the house I own and is also an adult who just went back to school. We plan to be together forever and  live in this house. I\u2019m planning a major renovation in the next few years. I would NEVER expect him to put half the money up up front, as this house is my investment and we are not married yet. I plan to take out a home equity loan to make the improvements that are needed and then what he pays me each month toward our living expenses will increase. I feel that\u2019s fair because he will also reap the benefit of the improvements as long as he lives here. But if something happens and we split up, it\u2019s up to me to continue making those payments, because it\u2019s my house. I will not increase his amount to more than he can afford, because I love him and I don\u2019t want to see him struggle. I will add that I lived in a house that was owned and paid up free and clear by my ex husband while we were still married. I put a lot of money into that house and when we divorced, I never saw any of it. So there\u2019s that. Trust your gut. If you have no claim to the house, married or not, you don\u2019t put money into it that you\u2019ll never see again if the relationship fails. Don\u2019t let him tell you otherwise.

I'm not one of those people at all, but even I think its ridiculous to have you pay for reno on a house you don't own.\n\nYou can pay rent, which is fine since you live there. But you don't own the house. He's technically your landlord. He should be paying to fix/repair/reno the house. Its that simple.\n\nPut your foot down and keep it there.", "NTA. If he wants you to pay for these things he can add you to the deed.", "NTA. I would probably move out. If he can\u2019t afford the house, that is not your problem and you should not over-extend yourself to enrich him. You should never have paid for anything to \u201callow the house to function\u201d because that is his responsibility as the owner. You are just a tenant. So you need to simply put the pin in that and if the rent he wants is too high give him notice you are leaving. Because this man does NOT have your best interests at heart. If he can\u2019t afford the upkeep of the house, that\u2019s his problem, not yours. \n\nThe fact that these are all expensive cosmetic projects that he wants to do in one fell swoop while offloading expenses to you while you gain nothing would be a HUGE red flag to me. And then threatening you with a rent increase if you don\u2019t comply would be another. Why does this all have to be done now? This feels like a short term plan that includes you that could all be part of a long term plan that could include you. So why does it have to be so short term, you know?", "NTA. Nope, nope nope. \n\nThis is no different than any other landlord/tenant situation. This is not your house and you should not be expected to pay for renovations.\n\nI\u2019ve been there myself. But now-ex and I were in total agreement about this. I bought furniture and electronics and kitchen stuff. He paid for repairs and improvements. When we broke up I took everything I paid for with me and he continued to enjoy everything he\u2019d done to the house.", "NTA. Move out for a year, let him do his projects, then move back in. This is the way. Do not pay up front for any improvements, not even a rent increase. Rent goes up when projects are DONE, not for a construction zone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have live together and present yourselves as married for at least 1 year, longer in some states. The presenting yourselves as being married is the biggest caveat here.", ">You\u2019re also considered common law after 6 months of cohabitation- she could argue that it\u2019s her house since they were living together as a couple.\n\nThis is not true everywhere. For example, this is not the definition of common law marriage anywhere in the US.", "Where I am it\u2019s living as a couple- not presenting as married.  You\u2019re sharing household expenses and they\u2019re your emergency contact? You may be living as a couple\u2026", "You notice that I keep saying \u2018in my area\u2019\n\nPeeps really gotta know the rules where they live.\n\nAnd, get this, most places aren\u2019t America.", "You say that you advocate for equality, but you're not, because you're not telling her to make the same down payment as him. If she did that, then sure, I'd agree with you. \nBut there's a massive difference in how much has already been invested into the house that you're not addressing. \nI feel like you take a very feministic approach of 'advocating for equality', while really only advocating dor preferential treatment for females. Which is essentially the definition of sexism.", "Lol no. I\u2019d say this about anyone. Do not invest in someone else\u2019s property. If you need someone to help pay your mortgage, get a roommate. If you aren\u2019t willing to own a home with the person you are living with while romantically entangled, your home costs are on you.", "So if I move in with a girl after dating for 12 months, to see if we are ready for that next step, you would demand of that girl that she puts me on the deed?", "Lmfao no. But I wouldn\u2019t expect you to pay for her mortgage or renovations? Like are you being intentionally dumb? I would never put some guy on the deed to my home unless we were married and had all the legalities worked out. But I wouldn\u2019t expect someone to pay for my house unless I wanted a roommate. Because that\u2019s what normal people who aren\u2019t trying to capitalize off their relationship do. I\u2019d rather live alone then pay some guys mortgage who could dump me next week and I\u2019d have paid into his equity? No thanks.", ">pay half of the project, or pay more I'm rent\n\nWhy doesn't he give you equity in the house for your investment?\n\nNTA, NEVER invest in a property that isn't yours.", "NTA- I live in my partners house and pay him rent. My rule is if it can\u2019t be removed from the house if we break up, I am paying for it.\n\nI don\u2019t contribute towards renovations, replacement parts, rates or general maintenance for the exact same reason you listed - the house is not in my name and there is no guarantee I\u2019d see that money again.\n\nJoint decisions such as big pieces of furniture we will discuss before hand & decide on payment from there. \n\nDon\u2019t pay for someone else\u2019s investment !", "NTA, if he wants you to put thousands into updating that house then he can put you on the deed or shut tf up", "NTA \n\nIf you're paying rent in the form of half his mortgage, you shouldn't be paying anything towards renovations OR maintenance -- emergency or otherwise... get that little agreement amended pronto.", "NTA\nTime to evaluate and move from there. He is definitely pushing as you already stated and argeed what y'all were going to pay. If he wants more money then he needs to put a guarantee on your money back. Draw up a contract that will state what you will pay extra and how he will reimburse you for it. Or stick with saying no and if he says you have to leave that's fine. For a house that's isn't your and no sign and marrying I would always have an exit plan.", "NTA. You're paying rent to him, not a mortgage payment to a bank, your name isn't on the deed. You aren't required to pay for improvements he wants to make to his property.", "Dastardly landlord seems a better option than OP\u2019s man, same situation as her current one but by grabthar\u2019s hammer, think of the savings!"]}
