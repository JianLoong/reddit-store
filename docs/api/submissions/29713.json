People like to abstractly talk about family and how blood means more than anything but from my personal experience and from seeing what has happened with friends families a majority of families will do their best to either drag you down or at minimum make you feel bad for doing better. Misery loves company. I grew up in poor and working class areas so I\u2019m sure rich people have their own problems but that\u2019s literally why so many people are stuck poor and in the ghettos because of this families mentality. \u201cHey your parents or siblings didn\u2019t go to college so could you just like not go to college that Will embarrass them\u201d", "NTA.

He is *choosing* to not be involved in the decisions.\n\nPart of the reason why he should own this decision is to give his fiance cover from his family.
