{"id": 21835, "submission_id": "14vflj4", "title": "AITA for not returning someone\u2019s deposit on Facebook Marketplace.", "selftext": "So basically, I am selling a small table with two chairs on Facebook marketplace. My rule for selling is that I will always select the first serious buyer that messages me. The first person to message me was a young college girl. \n\nThe listing is for 50$, she said she would be able to pickup in 4 days because she would have her moms car to drive. I told her it was fine so long as she paid half now over Cashapp. She agrees and everything seems fine. \n\nWell 4 days later, on the day she was supposed to come for pickup, she messages me saying she no longer is able to come because her moms car is broken down and her car is not big enough. I told her that it was fine and that I could deliver for a fee, and if not she could still come by within three days to get it. \n\nShe informs me that she lives a few hours away, and it is no longer possible for her to buy the table set. So I decided I was going to keep the 25$ she already sent me. \n\nI am trying to move out of my apartment, it\u2019s been in my way for the last 4 days as I\u2019m trying to pack, and several people have messaged me about buying it because it is modern retro style. Now I am going to have to waste even more time re-listing it and scheduling another buyer. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to keep a reservation fee when you don\u2019t show up at a hotel or restaurant, why is this any different? Having her pay some of it up front is insurance that she would show up.  \n\nShe is messaging me about returning the money, I haven\u2019t responded yet. AITA?  \n\nTLDR: I\u2019m selling something, someone payed a part of it upfront, and when she didn\u2019t show up to get it, I decided to keep what she payed.\n\n\nEDIT: I gave her back the 25$, and next time this happens I will communicate that it is non-refundable before it is agreed upon. I\u2019m still gonna be pissed about it though.

You know you\u2019re dealing with a young college student. \n2. You are out nothing but time. You still have the table and can still sell the table for your desired price. \n3. This person didn\u2019t string you along, they\u2019ve communicated their challenges in a timely fashion. \n\nYou want to keep a 50% deposit because it\u2019s in your way while you\u2019re moving and you have a queue of customers lined up to get it out of the way for the full price? That doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nYTA. What you\u2019re doing is predatory. \n\nBut it\u2019s not too late! Choose humanity and send this poor girl her $25 and sell the damn table already.", "YTA\nYou aren\u2019t a business. You didn\u2019t state it wasn\u2019t refundable up front. You\u2019re keeping it to be petty and that\u2019s it.", "YTA - The deposit on a hotel is not returned because that was explicitly said before the deposit was made. Not so in your case. You owe her her money back.", "INFO... Was she informed the deposit was non-refundable?", "YTA basic stealing, you didn\u2019t inform her it was non refundable.", "YTA unless you informed her that the \"deposit\" was nonrefundable.  Even if you did, it sounds like you can quickly sell the set so keeping $ from a young college student seems kind of like an A H  move.", "Shees, it's 25 bucks, what are you a peasant? YTA because you did not state it was a non refundable deposit.", "YTA and stingy af. Just message one of the several other people that want the table, refund the poor girl, and be done with it. Don\u2019t claim entitlement to her money just because your time was wasted.", "Yeah YTA more so if your post didn\u2019t say the deposit was refundable. All these things you mentioned above as a comparison are all know to be refundable.", "YTA\u2014 several ppl are messaging you, so you shouldn\u2019t have a problem coming off of it. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s shoved against a wall with boxes on it, not like you\u2019re tripping over the thing. You may be within your rights to keep it, but that doesn\u2019t make it right.", "YTA. Deposits are not to be assumed as nonrefundable unless explicitly said so. It's a security deposit so that someone else can't buy the item from under them while they arrange their plans to pick it up. Once she said she couldn't get it anymore, you relist the item and release the security deposit. No ripping off required.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re not a landlord, or a hotel. You\u2019re selling things on marketplace. She messed up by trusting you, but this is essentially a black market dealing. You suck.", "YTA, give her the money back she probably needs it way more than you considering she\u2019s a college kid. Plus it\u2019s only $25", "YTA. Yeah she\u2019s kind of a flake but just be an adult and give her the money back. You don\u2019t know what her situation is.", "Unless you told her the deposit was non refundable (like hotel\u2019s & restaurants do) then YTA", "I'm glad you returned the money, but going forward charge a non-refundable deposit on a  $50 item?!?!?!?!  \n\n\nThat seems like lunacy to me.  Why not just do first come first serve?", "YTA. Because you are one.", "YTA. If you didn't tell her it was non refundable beforehand, give it back.", "God, want me to just send you $25 since you are ovbiously severely impoverished?\n\nAs a regular person wouldnt fuck over a stranger for such a petty amount of money, you must really be struggeling!", "YTA. You were not put out financially or otherwise.", "YTA deposits are normally against a service or like you say a product like a hotel room where after a point cannot be resold (date passes etc) unless you stated was none refundable then YTA \nI know you have now returned the money but let it be a lesson that when conducting business nothing can be assumed everything needs to be set out and agreed preferably in writing", "Info did you mention at any point, if the deposit the person payed would be non refundable?", "It's worth what ever they agreed to. He now has to start over selling it. Some buyers may have moved on. He had to deal with it.", "Yta if she hasn\u2019t bought it then you return the money", "YTA. Over $25 dollars? You\u2019re awful.", "Wow, what an absolute arse you are. This college student didn\u2019t string you along, she obviously had problems getting to you. I sell a ton of stuff on FB marketplace and I\u2019d never treat someone like this. \n\nYTA and shame on you", "Completely YTA", "If if was a small deposit, just to prevent someone mucking you about then I would understand, but a 50% \"deposit\" is honestly ridiculous. And on top of that, you didn't even inform her about this in the first place. This is pretty scummy, YTA. You should return her money and in future be more transparent if you are ever selling stuff.", "YTA, you want to keep 50%, not even a small percentage from a college student who is having car trouble? You\u2019re out nothing but a couple days. If you\u2019re not going to have any issues selling it and aren\u2019t actually losing anything you are most certainly TA. Not to mention you didn\u2019t tell her you wouldn\u2019t refund her. \n\nAfter reading your replies, absolutely YTA.", "YTA. Unless you clearly stated this was non refundable then your not entitled to keep it and she has every right to take it further to get this back it\u2019s 25 bucks just return it and don\u2019t be an AH", "YTA. What is it, exactly, that made you think you deserve to keep her money? You gave her nothing. You lost nothing. The 5 minutes (tops) of communication you're using to justify your stance is not worth $25. Essentially you just wanna justify robbing this poor girl.", "Your heart grew three sizes this day.", "I just have to say to all the people that claim a deposit is refundable unless there is language to the contrary, you are wrong. That\u2019s the point of a deposit, that you put money down to ensure completion of the contract. If you don\u2019t then you forfeit it. That\u2019s the whole dang point of a deposit!", "Yta", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand all the Y T A responses. The entire point of the deposit was that you held the item for her for days when you could have easily sold it to someone else. If the $25 was to be returned to her when she backed out of buying it then what was the point? This leaves you with $0 and you\u2019re out the value of your time, so you\u2019re now in a negative value position from where you started. Her age/college status/financial status is irrelevant. People saying you should give the money back because you can easily sell it to someone else apparently think someone\u2019s time is worth nothing. The common attitude in this thread is exactly why selling anything on fb marketplace is a total pain in the a**.", "NTA. It's understood the deposit is to hold the item......", "NTA\nIt\u2019s a good lesson for this girl. She paid half to hold it so you didn\u2019t sell it to someone else for 4 days. You did hold it, you didn\u2019t sell it to someone else.", "Ok everyone, after reading all the comments, I guess I am the asshole. I have just returned the 25$, but I am still not happy she wasted my time. \n\nThanks", "ESH.  You added terms after the money was paid.  Hotels etc all have the terms listed upfront.  \n  \nThe hell is she doing buying furniture that's hours away when she doesn't have a car?", "Probably defends on whether you told her that\u2019s what you would do on non-pick up or not. If you let her know that then NTA. If you didn\u2019t, then maybe TA?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
