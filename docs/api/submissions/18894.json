I am not ready for either, she says kids not now but she is ready for marriage. We have been together for two years. I told her that I would love to marry her, just not now.\n\nNow to the problem. I moved to the states 3 years ago. During this i went no contact with my family. To the point of changing my name. Nothing big happened, i just needed to remove myself from that toxic environment. And for my name, i am atheists and my name is a translation of jesus and my second name is my father\u2019s name and I don\u2019t like it. So i just changed it completely.\n\nAly wants to get married and knows about my past, just not any names of my family. She puts family as a priority, and i like that. Her family is amazing, so i get where she is coming from. But now after two years she insists its a good idea to go back and rekindle my bond with my family. All because she wants that our future kids have grandparents from the dad\u2019s side and that she will feel like it\u2019s unfair for only be her family at our future wedding. This happened about a week ago.\n\nNow that is summer she wants to take a small vacation to my home country. I am from an island in the Caribbean, perfect for the summer but i feel like she just wants to go to have an excuse to push to meet my parents. I told her that it was a good idea to take a vacation but told her i was not going if she was going to search for my parents. \n\nShe said it wasn\u2019t and that she just wanted to relax for a week. She did seem a bit irritated that i said that but i am not sure. She is stubborn so its not out of possibility that she will. But she also have been talking about going on vacation to my home country since our first year anniversary. Yesterday she started searching hotels and activities, all not even close to my home town so i might be overreacting.", "created_utc": 1685824552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zopa7/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_to_never_search/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't love that she's pushing a trip back to your island but if she can manage herself and respect your boundaries, that's more promising. Don't get engaged for at least a year and be explicit that you're concerned that she won't be able to respect your need to stay no contact. Then the balls in her court. NTA", "NTA- I'd check they haven't moved to that town if I was you, something tells me she's already found them.", "NTA. Listen to your gut.  This is a red flag.  Why on earth would you ever go back there. There are so many other places to go. There is no reason for your gf to be so set on going there. \n\nShe's gaslighting you.  She may have already reached out to your family.  All it takes to get a DNA test done is a sample. Then she could have searched for your family.\n\nPlease recognize that she is completely dismissing your feelings. Please recognize that this is not about what she is doing but who she is.  She is someone who will always put her opinions, her wants, way above yours. She thinks you owe it to her to reunite with your family and doesn't care how you feel about it.\n\nThis is not a situational issue. It is systemic.  Look at it this way. You and you gf are building house.  This is not a broken window. It's compromised concrete. \n\nThere are quite a few reddit stories about SOs who \"surprise\" their partners with a reunion that the partner never wanted.", "I think that before you get engaged, you both would benefit from a few sessions with a counselor.  As we all do, you are both seeing THIS issue from your own perspective; a counselor may help you both see it from each other's perspective.\n\nIf she still purports that she wants to go to the Caribbean, suggest an island that is NOT your home country-& is not really close. If she refuses to even consider this\\~I think you can assume that she really is trying to arrange to meet your parents.", "NTA\n\nAly's desire for your hypothetical children to know their paternal grandparents does **not** outweigh your right to keep your family out of your life.", "NTA.

It may help your girlfriend to be really honest about her wants and dreams and for you to be a bit more vulnerable around your choices and loss.\n\nThis really is something that needs to be sorted now.\n\n Effectively what you\u2019d like to end up with is her saying, \u2018*I don\u2019t 100% understand your choices but I support them 100%. I won\u2019t push in any way for you to reunite with family and won\u2019t ever try to find them myself. In exchange, if you ever want to bring up finding family, I\u2019ll support that as much as you want. I also want you know that I\u2019ll have genuine feelings of sadness over our kids no knowing one side of the family, and these feelings aren\u2019t aimed at you.\u2019 \n\nNAH", ">after two years she insists its a good idea to go back and rekindle my bond with my family\n\nShe can ask how you feel about that - to *insist* is waaay overstepping. I can see why you're concerned about this. I hope she understands that you didn\u2019t just \"drift apart\" but the split was intentional and you have no plans to make contact again.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. She needs to respect boundaries. Do NOT go back to home country.", "NTA - she\u2019s not listening to you and thinks she knows better than you regarding your future plans and relationships. \n\nYou must get this addressed before you continue with this relationship.

They hear small bits and think it\u2019s something they could forgive their own parents for so it\u2019s not a big deal, not at all understanding it\u2019s a very different person and dynamic. I recommend couples counseling because people who come from very different families tend to struggle with this.", "NTA but are you certain she has no way to access the information of your parents? Either way, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you get to the vacation and she begins pushing you to go visit them even if you don\u2019t think you are nearby since you are already in the country. \n\nYou probably need to decide whether the relationship is worth pursuing if that happens and she won\u2019t drop it.", "You're not over reacting, you're going to get surprised with this in the same old trope that's going to end up with you breaking up with her, because y'all *AREN'T COMPATIBLE* \n\nNTA - but if you go on this trip, start thinking about what you plan on doing when she violates your NC with family.", "Honestly, I'm a bit concerned she plans to betray you. In her mind she is doing a good deed and everything will be sunshine and rainbows when you reunite with family, but it would destroy any trust you had in her and torpedo your relationship if this is any indication. Why go to your home country specifically? Why this area? Is it possible your family has moved there and she has already tracked them down? This just seems so fishy to me OP. It's up to you whether you want to take that chance. If anything it would be a good way to find out if she is a good person by being honest or betraying you, but it would also expose your new name to your family if she does betray you. Be very careful going forward.\n\nPlease have a deep conversation with her. Don't throw out accusations, but make it clear how much of a betrayal it would be to you and why if she were thinking of doing it. That it would make thinks bad for both of you. You need to be certain. \n\nNTA", "> she insists its a good idea to go back and rekindle my bond with my family\n\nExplain to her that there __IS NO BOND__ with your family. There was only pain and fear and misery, and she\u2019s just going to have to take your word for it that going back is a really bad idea.", "NAH. This sounds like a fork in the road.\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable for her to wonder about your family and even the cause of your estrangement. A person who could easily cut off their entire family and change their name, could conceivably do the same to a spouse. Your girlfriend may feel uncomfortable moving forward with you because of all this.\n\nFair enough for you to want to leave the past behind as well.", "NTA. Should your currently non-existent children wish to investigate their lineage, they will have the right to do so when they come of age. But that's not relevant to you or your partner right now because a) they don't exist, and b) you've done the difficult work of extracting yourself from a painful situation so you can have a better life, which is way more valuable to your hypothetical children than a family you want no part of.", "No your not overreacting. There have been a few stories in here where the wife thought she knew better and went ahead and contacted the hubby family and ended in disaster.  I remember one where the wife invited his family to the wedding, guess what? The wedding didn't happen. It was all her fault because she wouldn't listen and he left her at the altar.", "NAH.\n\nAnd from what you've told us she may **genuinely** not intend to violate this boundary. Maybe the choice of the Caribbean is because she's **hoping** to re-engage that family side; but from what you've said here she is doing everything right and you're making your wishes clear.\n\n. \n\nBut you're not making clear ***why*** and that may be a problem. For those of us who come from happy, healthy, wholesome homes it can be damn near impossible to instinctively understand and empathize with how bad and toxic a home can truly get. It's like trying to explain the below-freezing North Pole to a desert-dweller. \n\nDo yourself a favor - spend some time with love and openness trying to help her understand how you feel about your family, why you don't want to go down that road, and why you **dont** feel that way about her family, or your family to be with her.", "If you don't want to marry her, split up and let her find someone else.  Don't keep her hanging.", "I can see her just wanting to see the country you came from, because she loves you. That's normal.\n\nDid you ever tell her why you went NC? It might help. Also have her read some of the subs with insane parents, in laws etc. Coming from such a good family, and being so young she may not realize how horrible families can be.\n\nNAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
