I am not ready for either, she says kids not now but she is ready for marriage. We have been together for two years. I told her that I would love to marry her, just not now.\n\nNow to the problem. I moved to the states 3 years ago. During this i went no contact with my family. To the point of changing my name. Nothing big happened, i just needed to remove myself from that toxic environment. And for my name, i am atheists and my name is a translation of jesus and my second name is my father\u2019s name and I don\u2019t like it. So i just changed it completely.\n\nAly wants to get married and knows about my past, just not any names of my family. She puts family as a priority, and i like that. Her family is amazing, so i get where she is coming from. But now after two years she insists its a good idea to go back and rekindle my bond with my family. All because she wants that our future kids have grandparents from the dad\u2019s side and that she will feel like it\u2019s unfair for only be her family at our future wedding. This happened about a week ago.\n\nNow that is summer she wants to take a small vacation to my home country. I am from an island in the Caribbean, perfect for the summer but i feel like she just wants to go to have an excuse to push to meet my parents. I told her that it was a good idea to take a vacation but told her i was not going if she was going to search for my parents. \n\nShe said it wasn\u2019t and that she just wanted to relax for a week. She did seem a bit irritated that i said that but i am not sure. She is stubborn so its not out of possibility that she will. But she also have been talking about going on vacation to my home country since our first year anniversary. Yesterday she started searching hotels and activities, all not even close to my home town so i might be overreacting.\n\nEdit1: some have been interested in why i went NC. Well, parents have been in a dysfunctional marriage. Always fighting for anything. Dad and me never bonded as his work keep him out of the house most of the day. Mom was the opposite, stay at home for most of my life, too much attention and using me and my brothers as her life goals. If we did bad at school she will blame us and gave us the cold shoulder. Our opinions where never counted in big decisions concerning all of us. We didn\u2019t have much money so family activities where basically non. As the years went by they never adapted to us growing up, so it was always their little kids and we never had the option to grow socially as everything had a danger. Their toxic back and forth passive aggressive on anything really grind me down in my last years of undergrad. As par of the extended family, father side are most alcoholics, uncle did a murder suicide. Mother side we have alcoholism and some drug addicts and one in jail for it. \n\nAly\u2019s family is the opposite, always there and learning how to accommodate new needs. For example, she has a younger sister and her parents have taken the time to learn about her sister hobbies and bond by it. My parents would just say, oh cool and walk off. Aly\u2019s family basically adopted me and helped me as soon as when we met, I wasn\u2019t financially stable at all. They have taken time to learn about my hobbies and work. Now a days i go with her father and uncle to fish or the racing track once a month. \n\nAs for Aly, she is an amazing woman. We share hobbies that we love doing together. We support each other. She sends me flowers at work, it might sound dumb but that made me cry of happiness the first time she did that. She always find new ways to make me laughs. I found my perfect half with her, no better way to describe her. \n\nAly knows all of my past. I will talk to her more seriously about it. I love her to death and her family. And as cold as it sounds, it is what it is. If she wants to keep insisting, we will go our separate ways. Nothing like tearing myself apart one more time and rebuild elsewhere.

It's up to you whether you want to take that chance.

Let's get that out of the way.\n\nIt is going to be very hard for Ally to really understand what it's like to have a seriously toxic family... especially given that she grew up in such a good one.  The only people who really understand what it's like to grow up in a bad family are people who have first hand knowledge.  Mine was bad... police should have been involved, and probably institutionalization at a mental health hospital.  Even my uncle doesn't really understand what it was like, and he's a pretty close relative.  He tried to get me to reconnect with my mother... he did eventually give up once he got first-hand experience of how bad she could be.    \n\n\nI don't know if Ally will ever get it.  It sounds like she really doesn't, and that she'll keep trying to get you and your family back together.  I don't know what it'll take to get her to at least accept that you won't accept that.  Maybe she never will, I wish you good luck, though.", "NTA but you need to talk to Aly. She has a wonderful  family so it is very likely she can not comprehend why you went no contact.

She thinks you should rekindle that relationship because she wants you to and she thinks it would be a good idea.  I\u2019m hearing a whole lot about what she thinks and what she wants and not nearly enough about her respecting YOU and YOUR experiences. \n\nThere was a post on Reddit a while back about a man who along with his siblings had gone no contact with their mom.  His fianc\u00e9 decided that SHE knew better and arranged for his mom to be at the wedding ceremony.  Long story short, he left the ceremony and they never married, and his siblings were 100% behind him.

Fair or not, both OP and his girlfriend should have different red flags for each other, rendering their relationship unsustainable.", "Youd be amazed how ridiculous real life can be.\n\nA good friend from high school has a ridiculous mother. My friend isn't the type to lie or embellish, and I've known her for 20 years - I witnessed some of this first hand as well.\n\nA very short list of some of the wild shit her mother has pulled includes:\n\n* Cancelling my friends 16th birthday literally 5 minutes before it was scheduled (I was AT THE DOOR when I got the phone call from her mother) because my friend hadnt folded 3 dress shirts. That was verbatim from her mother to me - I was allowed to drop off my gift and then had to call my mom from back on the step.\n\n* Stealing my friends whole college fund and using it for a 1 month trip to Mexico for her and her affair partner. My friend is the middle child, neither of her siblings had their college funds touched.\n\n* Taking a baby grand piano that belonged to my friend in the divorce - which she had to hire professional movers for and did in the span of 1 hour without giving notice. (I was at the house for lunch, we went back on our spare period, and the piano was gone.)\n\n* Faking stage 4 cancer so my friend would speak to her.\n\n* Trying to bribe my friends older sibling with $5,000 cash to get the location of my friends wedding - so she could crash it and object during the ceremony. Guess why she wasnt invited. (We also had friends who had volunteered specifically as bouncers for the awful egg donor, so she was never going to make it in even if the bribe had worked.)\n\n* Casually brandishing an illegal gun (also without a gun license, let alone concealed carry - and we're not in the US so its even worse, lol) at a **restaurant** during a \"reconciliation\" dinner with my friend. (Who went in order to tell her egg donor to her face to fuck off forever and always, and because it was a public place)\n\nSome people really are that ridiculous. After seeing much of the above (and oh so much more) live in full color...I will never disbelieve the craziness unless  a set of twins and another of triplets are all married AND having affair babies with each others spouses/twins.
