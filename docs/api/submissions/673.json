My husband and I have a dog of our own and she's very friendly with SIL's dog. We adore dogs so we didn't exactly mind about having an extra dog at our house but we were just bothered with SIL's entitled attitude of refusing to take responsibility for a choice she made. We had talked to her about that multiple times and she always made excuses that she's struggling right now financially and once she gets a proper job with proper work hours she'll get the dog back.\n\nShe got that job, got the dog back but only for 2-3 months and then kept dumping her dog to either us or her parents again and only took her to her place once or twice a week.\n\nLet's go to now. In July SIL announced she'll be moving in Australia for good and that took us by surprise because she hadn't made any mention of moving to another country before. After we talked about that we asked what about the dog? She said that she's really sad she can't take the dog with her but Australia is really strict on animal laws and moving animals there so she'll have to take a lot of action that she can't afford at the moment so the dog would stay in Italy with us. She said she wish she could take the dog with her but she agreed to change the dog's info on the microchip and have us adopt her dog. I can't say I was surprised and tbh my husband and I didn't trust her to have the dog with her since she's been really irresponsible with that.\n\n\nSo few days ago she came in Italy to visit us and announced she'll have the dog do all the necessary procedures so she can bring her to Australia with her. My husband and I reminded her that the dog is now adopted by us and after all we don't trust her to be responsible with her. \n\nShe thought we were joking but we insisted we are not giving the dog back. She was mad at us and my in laws, aka husband's parents believe we are ta for insisting to keep the dog from her instead of giving her back to SIL because in their words \"She got the dog originally, you wouldn't have the dog if it wasn't for her and the dog is hers whether you agree with her choices on how to take responsibility or not\". \n\nWe are still planning to refuse to give her the dog.

Your life is affected by this so yes, yes it does matter.", "NTA, she changed the information because she already put out there that she had the intentions to abandon the dog with you permanently rather than just for short time frames.\n\nContinue to refuse to give her the dog, because she has already shown multiple times before that she only got a dog to satisfy a want, not because she actually had any intention to take care of an animal.

The dog deserves stability and loving attention, not wondering where their humans disappeared to.\n\nMake the right decision for the dog and don't worry about the asshole humans.", "NTA.

I wouldn't trust her with any pet.", "NTA, who would she dump the dog on all the way over there?", "NTA.\n\nI'm from Australia and very, very few people bring their dogs over here, even when the dog is a beloved family member. I think in my life I've met only 1 dog from overseas. Quite aside from the quarantine process being arduous, it's also a really long flight time. \n\nI would suggest she gets a rescue dog, but the very fact that she's thinking of taking the Jack Russell out of your home and to Oz tells me she's still not mature enough to consider the dog's best interests above her own whims.  You are right to be unwavering on this.", "NTA, but if you want you could totally \"invoice\" her for however long youve had the dog... Roughly assuming she went to Australia in August, at 20 euro/night thats over 1800, then tack on food, supplies, vet visits, whatever else you want to make it a high enough number that she backs off.  Heck, 20/night is just the average i saw in Italy, you can just be \"premium\" and double or triple it.  \n\n\nOf course refuse her any way, but sometimes fake charging extreme amounts of money is both petty and effective", "Nope definitely NTA!! She gave up ownership of the dog that she couldn\u2019t even take care of! The dog is now in a stable loving home, and should not continue to be bounced around at SiL\u2019s whim.", "NTA.  Your SIL is the worst kind of dog owner.  The dog deserves a home where it will be cared for and loved.", "Aussie here, yes we do have strict laws regarding bringing animals into the country. Most of them involve the animal has had all their vaccinations, flea treatments and intestinal treatments, the latter two to be done by a Government approved vet. So if she didn't have the money to do that, she wasn't taking care of the dog properly because this is all something a responsible pet owner needs to keep on top of. Yes there are permits and quarantine but the majority of the tasks are vet related. NTA.

Responsibility that she never seemed to have, also.\n\nAlso, with all the time the dog spent with you, even before the adoption, the dog considers you both as their humans, not the SIL.", "NTA\n\nKeep YOUR, not her dog!  I hope you had the dog microchipped. She kept dumping the dog on you and others way too often.  Poor dog may get aggravated by the move.  So don't give in at all.

Did the right thing by keeping it.", "It\u2019s super expensive to transport a dog into Australia.  They have mandatory quarantine. How can she afford it.  Smh", "NTA. She appears to be an irresponsible dog owner and it's your dog now. The microchip is in your name and it sounds like legally the dog is yours if I'm understanding the law in Italy correctly.", "NTA.  But you should make clear to your in-laws that the dog IS yours--you adopted her.  You are her owners.  Your SIL GAVE HER UP.  Once she did so, she lost all claims to the dog because, again, SHE GAVE UP OWNERSHIP.  I mean, if you sell a used car, you don't get to demand it back just because you changed your mind some months later on.  And the people who bought said car certainly aren't obligated--legally or morally--to give you back said car, which is now legally theirs.\n\nI would use the adoption of a child as an analogy but frankly, that makes your SIL look even worse and more of an AH so I'm sure it wouldn't go down well with the in-laws.", "NTA.

A while later we watched the dog while that family went away for a short trip, and from then on he would without fail, every morning jump their fence and run across the street to our front door. eventually it seemed more sensible to just have him stay at ours\u2014he loved it there, he loved our dog, and him running across the street every morning wasn\u2019t super safe (even though we live somewhere with VERY little traffic). \n\nFast forward about 6 months, and the original owner came to grab him (with honestly very little communication and planning, but I digress). It was really sad for us, but it was what it was, so we let him go. Then, another few months later, he had plans to travel abroad with his son (whom he had not much contact with. messy situation all around with his family) and intended to leave the dog with us. the night he was supposed to show up, he just... didn\u2019t. The next morning, my mom got a call from a pound quite far from us (and not somewhere he would have driven through on the way to ours either). They had the dog, and her phone number was on the collar. This was how we found out that the previous night, he crashed into a parked car and was arrested for a DUI, and the dog was impounded by the police. So essentially, what was meant to be two weeks of us looking after the dog turned into indefinite. \n\nOver the next year I believe he did some rehab, and other things. eventually he called us out of the blue to ask for the dog back. My parents were reluctant, but he gave the reason that this was his SON\u2019s dog, and the son really loved him and wanted him around as he started high school. So my mother agreed, and a few weeks later he showed up. (this again had a concerning lack of communication\u2014we found out which weekend he was coming from our neighbour\u2019s 13 or 14yo son). He also showed little gratitude throughout all of this\u2014as if life could just be put on hold for him and he could come right back to it, when we had spend a year and a half in total absorbing this dog into our family. (to be clear: I am sympathetic toward his mental health and addiction struggles. I have a LOT of mental health issues myself. the problem I had with this was the complete and utter lack of responsibility or even awareness of how his actions and his absence had permanently affected others)\n\nHe took the dog, who was reluctant to leave, and left shortly after to the other side of the state. Not long after this we discovered that he\u2019d been hiding two puppies from us that he\u2019d bought for his son, and the \u201cthis dog is my son\u2019s dog\u201d was a complete lie. we were furious and heartbroken that he lied, especially since we likely would have given him the dog regardless, but there was nothing we could do about it. \n\nmonths later, we find out he suddenly moved to another state, out of nowhere, to be with his old high school sweetheart (functionally abandoning his son with the kid\u2019s maternal grandparents in the process\u2014so the \u201ci just care so much about my son\u201d argument seems like a lie too) and took the dog with him. I don\u2019t know all the details, but around then he was flying back and forth a lot between were he used to live to his new place, and it was during one of these times that we found out the dog passed away. His girlfriend\u2019s family was apparently checking on him a couple times a day and found him dead one morning. He likely died of neglect. The owner refused to do a necropsy. \n\nSo what I want to say is: if you do not trust her to look after the dog, DO NOT let her take the dog. she\u2019s been previously unreliable and inconsistent, making sudden changes to her plans and expecting everyone to go with it. this rings so many red flags with me. hold this dog close and don\u2019t let her go.", "NTA you adopted the dog and the dog is yours.", "NTA", "NTA because no one in this story is treating the dog like a living being but OP and Partner. I can guarantee OP PIL would NOT have the same attitude if it were a child.", "NTA. I am not sure about Italian law, but at least where I live, you have transfer names to yours in microchip, so it would considered yours, so she have no claims to the dog.", "NTA you adopted the dog and it\u2019s yours now. In laws are just straight up wrong. She let you adopt the dog there was no agreement that she would be getting the dog back.", "NTA.  She gave the dog to you so now it\u2019s entirely up to you if you want to give it back.", "NTA. She clearly doesn't really care about the dog. It sounds like it's basically been an accessory for her that she likes to have when it's convenient. Further, she allowed you to adopt the dog. It's your dog now. It's part of your family. I would say that if she wants a dog in Australia so much she should look into adopting one there. I'm sure there are plenty of dogs in shelters who would love a home but I don't really think that's a good idea. I get the feeling she'd drop it back off at the shelter once she got bored with it. Which is another reason to not let her have the dog back--when she gets bored of having it around she'll inevitably bring it to a shelter or re-home it again since that seems to be her MO and you'll be too far away to adopt it again.", "She's obviously lonely and infantilic. Nta", "Your SIL sounds flaky, always changing her mind.\n\nNTA. its now your dog. Not hers. So she is now free to go to Australia... dog free as she originally wanted.\nAnd hopefully the dog can have a better/settled life with you and your husband.", "NTA\n\nSounds like SIL might have originally bought the dog as a Covid companion and then found out how much care a pet needs.", "NTA. She said I'm going to Australia, I can't bring the dog, please adopt my dog. So you did. The only thing she ever did for that dog was purchase it. She sees him once a week? Thank god you guys helped with the dog, otherwise that dog would be locked in a crate all day or pooping an peeing everywhere trapped inside the house all day. She's delusional. If you never care for your pet and just dump him on people, that's neglect.", "NTA. Keep the dog. She won\u2019t take care of it in Australia.", "NTA", "This reminds me of a situation that occurred in my family a couple years back. Cousin had a dog she left at our Grandma's house, and I ended up taking care of the dog five years. Cousin decides she is going to be a traveling nurse; decides to take the dog so she won't be, \"Lonely!\" He was legally hers, what could I do? After two months, she claims she arrived home and finds him passed away...or so I was told. I found out later on, she was sick of the responsibility, and put him down.\n\nPlease, don't be like me. Keep that dog safe. I wish I had fought harder to keep him here. RIP my sweet boy.", "NTA. When she decided to move half way around the world and leave the dog with you, the far more responsible party, she relinquished ownership of the dog \nCase closed..", "NTA. You've been put to a lot of trouble , and your experience suggests that she'll just change her mind again. There are dogs in Australia. If she wants one, she can find one!", "NTA love how you guys are good dog parents!", "NTA poor doggie", ">you wouldn't have the dog if it wasn't for her...\n\n...giving it to you.

Since when is that the only dog in the world, anyway?", "NTA your dog. I wouldn't give him back either.", "She wasn't talking care of the dog to begin with and then she had you legally adopt her. That's her loss\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA. Who knows how she will treat the dog in Australia ?", "It costs thousands to bring a dog to Australia and landlords here are way more dickish about it than in Europe. The dog would also have to fly cargo, unlike European airlines that let the dog be in the cabin. \n\nThis dog is very unlikely to make it to Oz and then she's unlikely to keep it.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but she\u2019s a messy, selfish AH.", "NTA... the dog is comfortable where he is. I wouldnt trust her with a dog with her record", "NTA legally that dog became yours when the microchip info was changed. She really had no right to ask for him back in the first place. Plus, if you did give him back to her, what would she do when you or your parents aren't there for when she wants to dump the dog somewhere? That kind of behavior doesnt change. That poor pup will end up abandoned on the street or in a shelter. Do right by the doggy and keep him. He'll be much better off with you and your family!", "I'm a dog person. Every dog I have ever had was owned and then abandoned by someone else first.  None of them disserve to get them back.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t have continued to enable her and now you\u2019ve backed yourself into this corner where you\u2019ve forced yourself to be an asshole.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s what\u2019s best for the dog (there\u2019s no way of knowing, but this seems likely) but either way you made yourself an asshole.\n\nMy motto is \u201cnot my dog, not my problem\u201d", "It'd be even worse with her moving to another country, because the people she's always left the dog with wouldn't be there. She might instead leave it with someone she barely knows, or just neglecting it.", "NTA and this was my thinking exactly. Make sure no one has keys to your home or a way to get in to take the dog by force while you aren't home.", "Additionally, bringing your pet to Australia is a PROCESS. Of course health information must be complete and up to date, but Australia also requires animals to be quarantined for I believe 3 - 6 months before she is able to take the dog home. This means no human interaction, no walks, just 4 walls until immigration is certain there's no risk of rabies entering the continent. When I lived in Australia I met a chocolate lab that came from the states. He was quarantined for 6 months and was not social with other dogs anymore as a result. When I left Australia, I brought my dog with me to Canada. It cost $5500 for the flight alone. This is not a decision she should make lightly or selfishly. She really needs to consider the wellbeing of the dog.", "THIS RIGHT HERE. If she considered the dog a true family member, she'd absolutely want what's best for the dog.  Instead she sees the dog as a pet whenever she'd like some company but then an inconvenience otherwise.  She has you to take care of the dog now and give it the care it needs. Who knows what'll happen to the poor dog in Australia.  NTA and please stand firm. This is YOUR dog now. NTA", "Well, it would be difficult to take a stolen dog to Australia, they are really strict about how these things are done.", "My neighbor went through moving to Australia and their dog had to be in quarantine for over a month and it\u2019s pretty expensive from my understanding. A dog deserves a reliable owner. NTA", "And they sell and rescue dogs in Australia. So, bye. This one doesn't need you anymore and he belongs to someone else, anyway.", "NTA, I live in Australia, there are lots of dogs needing to be adopted. She can adopt a Greyhound: lots need to be adopted and they're relatively low maintenance (sleep 18 hours a day, need less exercise than other dogs, etc).", "Depending on what country you are coming from and where the animal originated. Could be any way from a few hours of quarantine for returning animals up to 6 months for extreme cases where animals are coming from high risk areas", "Also in Australia we are coming into summer which depending on location can get \ud83d\udd25 HOT. A small dog like that left outside with inadequate water or shelter would be \u2620\ufe0f in only a couple of hours.

Not good for animals with negligent owners.", "Yes, the poor pup could be in quarantine for literally MONTHS, and bringing a dog here is not cheap. I'm talking thousands of dollars.", ">Remind her that in Australia if I'm not mistaken an animal has to spend six months in a kennel in quarantine to prove it's disease free.\n\nYou're mistaken. It's 10 days now.", "As far as the USA goes, it used to be a month and a half but they reduced it to 10 days given no signs of anything shown. If things do come up it can go for longer in quarantine or even being put down. But the process takes 6+ months with documented vet visits and shots.", "A JRT would not do well in quarantine. Mine gets cranky if it\u2019s pissing rain and she doesn\u2019t get a walk for a day or two.", "A bot stole your reply but only copied part of it for some reason.", "Worse even, it\u2019s a JRT. They\u2019re highly energetic and get anxious and don\u2019t really like change.", "It seems that you, like SIL, don\u2019t understand what adoption is.

It might actually be \"literally everywhere that isn't New Zealand\". Biosecurity restrictions for live animals also changes frequently depending on what diseases are circulating at any given time.

The UK also has a troubling history with highly transmissible and zoonotic diseases in cattle, sheep, and goats. \n\nIt's an exclusionary risk management approach that works incredibly well.
