You should probably apologize but really have a conversation that you are concerned about an eating disorder. Not all overweight people eat like that.

I do believe in everyone is beautiful in their own size, sometimes people have underlying hormone problems and makes it harder to lose weight no matter how healthy of a lifestyle they have.
