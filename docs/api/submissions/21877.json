She's going through a divorce, he took everything. The kids not his and a prenup was signed. We told her to just worry about her own food, as I didn't like the idea of eating together due to their history with food. I don't know how to put it nicely so I guess I will go blunt.. her and her kid never stop eating. They both have severe health issues, as both of them combined are over 600lbs and live a very fat-positive life. Now, it's none of my business but when it comes to the kid, it's fucked up. I don't care what anyone says. When a 12yo is pushing 220lbs and has a doctor breathing down your neck, it's time for a change versus pushing body positivity. The kid is a great girl but just her by herself could easily eat enough to feed 4 grown men who haven't eaten all day. So that was my stipulation. They buy their own food and cook everything separate. I even cleaned out our entire pantry to give them for their own food space. \n\nWell, my kids and I needed a break and took off for a week to a resort. My husband didn't want to go (he didn't want to leave them in our home unattended) but encouraged us to get out of here because we were pretty fed up with company. I had just spent almost $400 on food prior to leaving so our freezer was full and so was our cupboards. This would feed us (me, husband, kids) for easily 2 weeks. Well, I got home last night and ALL of the food is gone. Every single bit of it. I know for a fact it wasn't my husband. He works 14-16 hour days and usually buys takeout on his way home when I'm not there so he can just go to sleep when he gets back. I look in my SILs pantry and all her food is gone too, which was full when I left. I immediately question it and my SIL apologizes and said her and her kid got hungry and her legs hurt too much to drive to the store. I said \"why the fuck didn't you just get grocery delivery?\" And she said \"I didn't think you would mind.\" So I snapped and said \"obviously I fucking mind. You and your kid just ate well over $800 worth of food in a fucking week; $400 of it being mine, which you will be reimbursing me for. Maybe stop eating so damn much.\" And I walk off. Now she's pissed at me and crying wolf to anyone who will listen for me \"fat shaming\" her and her kid.", "created_utc": 1689017404, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w3p2d/aita_for_telling_my_sil_to_maybe_stop_eating_so/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA. Your SIL is abusing her child. Yes, she has a problem, but she is also responsable for her and for her child, so she needs to start doing something and stop eating so damn much would be a good option.", "Nta. If you put aside that she is slowly killing her child- she stole your food.", "NTA. She stole $400 from you, plain and simple. And yeah, $400 would be a MONTHLY budget per person, not weekly.", "NTA - being morbidly obese is no joke and your wouldn\u2019t react well if someone took $400 out of your purse which is kind of what has happened here. Eat less is good advice, it\u2019s not your fault if she can\u2019t handle it.", "NTA -  I dont think its unreasonable to be upset that that someone ate your months worth of groceries in a week. I am a person of extra mass myself and  I know losing weight isn't easy. But I also know eating all the time isn't going to fix it.", "NTA. Letting a 12-year-old girl get to 220 lbs through overeating is child abuse. She needs to pay you back, but since your husband is her brother, ideally he'd be the one to fight that battle.", "NTA, your SIL literally stole from your family because she felt entitled to. Quite frankly, either she gives you the money or she finds another lace to live.", "NTA. I would be fucking pissed about this! Groceries are expensive AF right now and that's just very inconsiderate.  She could have at least replenished everything but decided to give you some bullshit excuse.\n\nAlso what she is doing to her kid is abuse. Plan and simple.", "NTA.\n\nShe\u2019s free to live as she prefers, and though I lament it, it\u2019s probably still preferable for the kid to be with her living like than than with the system, but you had one rule for her, and she broke it.\n\nWorse: she didn\u2019t let you know, and hoped to bank on your sympathy.\n\nThat last dig was unnecessary, but still NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. It's sad that she has let things get to this point for her and her daughter.  Maybe it's time to reconsider the single rule you set (that they ignored anyways).  *If you guys want to stay, you have to show us that you are putting some effort into a healthier lifestyle.*", "NTA. I would be pissed. She needs to pay you back and get out. She knew what she was doing and did it anyway. Disrespectful", "NTA.

I am overweight and so is my wife so I feel like I can have a biased opinion on this. Your SIL and niece have an eating disorder. We would not consume $800 worth of food in a week. That is a ridiculous amount of food. Could you have been a bit more gentle? Sure. But I am sure you were in shock. You should probably apologize but really have a conversation that you are concerned about an eating disorder. Not all overweight people eat like that. For myself I am actually shocked sometimes how much my slender friends eat compared to what I eat and yet they maintain a healthy weight. My coworkers would be snacking ALL day and here I am eating my salad for lunch and nothing else lol and they are 130 pounds and don\u2019t work out! I just mean to say all overweight people don\u2019t eat like that and that\u2019s definitely a problem. Whether it\u2019s depression or an eating disorder, they need professional help.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA and the people calling you and asshole for telling her to stop eating are not taking into account that probably you are already fed up with their stay at your house and that this event is maybe the straw that broke the camel's back. I am sorry but rude guests are the worst. Of course her legs hurts if she is overweight, but it is not your problem. I do believe in everyone is beautiful in their own size, sometimes people have underlying hormone problems and makes it harder to lose weight no matter how healthy of a lifestyle they have. The problem here is when the overweight is a health risk and not caused by a medical condition but by the amount of food you consume then you have a problem that it is in your hands to change. It is time for a tough talk.", "NTA. \n\nTo me, body positivity is accepting that we\u2019re all different.  We all have non-perfect forms/bodies (through disability, etc.) and to not shame others because of this. \n\nIt\u2019s NOT accepting that someone (especially a child) eats like crazy and is morbidly obese.  That\u2019s not okay.", "lol she needs to go outside to feel real shame", "NTA that's child abuse if I were you I'd be making a call to cps...", "NTA though I'm on the verge of an E S H because while you are right about everything, the \"maybe stop eating so damn much\" comment was completely unnecessary and was indeed fat-shaming. \n\nAnd no, I am not defending that this woman is giving her daughter a myriad of potential health problems (both physical and mental). But shaming her for eating too much is not helpful for the situation, rather the opposite. \n\nHowever, as this is an adult who is not only neglecting her daughter but also acting like an inconsiderate asshole with the people who are hosting them for free, is that I vote nta. \n\nYou're not an asshole, I would be livid if I was you. And I think she needs to not only reimburse you for the food, but actually go and do the shopping (give her a list). Because it's not just about the cost, but the time and effort that goes into buying groceries and sorting a freezer and cupboards. You did that so you wouldn't need to bother for another two weeks, you shouldn't have to go do it all over again now.", "SIL stole $400 from OP and I can see why OP was angry.  However, a 220 pound person does NOT eat as much as 4 grown men who haven\u2019t eaten all day.

NTA for expecting her to pay you back for hundreds of dollars of food.", "ESH. Her weight is irrelevant and you should have left that part out. She stole from you and that's not OK.
