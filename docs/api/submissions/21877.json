You should probably apologize but really have a conversation that you are concerned about an eating disorder. Not all overweight people eat like that.

I do believe in everyone is beautiful in their own size, sometimes people have underlying hormone problems and makes it harder to lose weight no matter how healthy of a lifestyle they have.

Does anyone else think this might be a response to the situation? SIL and kid were left with nothing, and would undoubtedly be homeless  without her brother. Some people eat to cope. It's disordered eating. \n\nNot saying it's right, and that's a lot of weight for a 12 year old. She literally ate you out of house and home. But then again I look at the deeper reasons: trauma, abandonment, stress eating. Kid lost a father figure, that's gotta hurt. Mom isn't helping the situation, but might be blinded by her own food issues. Make her repay you, encourage her to find her own place, and maybe recommend therapy.", "NTA \u2014 she should go cry wolf in someone else\u2019s home.", "NTA. \n$800 of food in a WEEK is a scary and huge red flag that something is wrong. So they are eating/wasting $2400 worth of food a month, if allowed! That\u2019s unsustainable, dangerous, and financially abusive to herself/her child on top of the health risks.", "Wow. NTA at all. How do they do that? That\u2019s a lot of food a lot a lot.", "Anyone who take food from my child and that's exactly what stealing all your food is would be lucky to only be insulted...\n\nNTA. Immediate expulsion from the house.", "Too many people say somebody is fat shaming them, when in reality they just can\u2019t stop eating a need to see a food therapist. Eat what you want, but not the children. It is a parent\u2019s responsibility to care for and make sure their child is eating healthy.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t fat shame her!  She\u2019s playing victim to manipulate people to gang up on you. Tell her it\u2019s strictly a money issue and she can reimburse your $400 or move out. She\u2019s trying to get out of paying you. Maybe some of those people can take her in!", "NTA. Eating too much is making them fatter, more unhealthy and less able for them to fend for themselves in general. Does she expect to live in your house and eat everything forever?", "Nta, and she can be body positive and thats ok, but what she is doing is child abuse, she is failing her kid .\n\nGroceries are expensive, they ate 2 weeks of food of a whole family in one week, plus their own food, that\u2019s too much.\n\nAnd also, if she is to large to buy groceries to her own kid, then it\u2019s not healthy anymore", "NTA. Sometimes the truth hurts", "NTA. Wow", "NTA that's less fat shaming and more thief shaming.", "NTA Honestly, putting aside the overweight situation and everything else, it becomes a matter of they ate $400 worth of YOUR food and had no intention of replacing it. That's the problem. Not ok. Never gonna be ok.", "NTA. She can\u2019t mention \u2018fat shaming\u2019 because it wasn\u2019t about her weight but about her behaviour. If she was thin and ate all the food at the house it wouldn\u2019t be acceptable anyway.", "NTA", "NTA she needs to get some food addiction therapy and some help and that poor child is going to end up in an early grave due to this bs \"body positivity movement\" there's being comfortable in your skin and there's..this side of that crap. \n\nAnd I'm fat myself. That's just shameful. Child needs help.", "Nta, and this is coming from an obese woman at 5'2 270 lbs lol. I'm fat yet barely manage to spend 270/month on groceries and while I do have a problem with the occasional issue of overeating once in a while, I can't imagine eating $400 worth of food within a week! I sometimes barely manage to eat more than twice a day, though my meals tend to not be the healthiest lol. I actually just had a bariatric consultation this morning and will probably be getting gastric sleeve...  220 lbs at only 12 years old is certainly concerning and it sounds like child abuse to me too. Her mother is definitely doing her a disservice. Most of my weight was gained on medications that caused weight gain as a side effect. I mean. Body positivity is nice and certainly a good thing and bmi index is kinda bullshit but realistically speaking, being 220 lbs at 12 years old is very unhealthy for sure unless the girl is exceedingly tall and muscular lol...", "NTA. From a former fat kid who was heavier at 12 than what I am in my 30\u2019s", "This is coming from someone that's always been a big guy. NTA. NOT THE FUCKING ASSHOLE. You didn't punch down at someone over an argument, you didn't \"fat shame\" them. They ate nearly $1000 worth of food for a family of 6. I'd bet my next paycheck that her body positivity is a coping mechanism against seeking the help her and her kid desperately need. It's one thing to be happy with the skin you're in; but some people really need to check back in with reality. If your habits can lead to you dying sooner rather than later, it's time to reevaluate your choices.", "I don't think you're gonna see downvotes \n\nThe body positivity movement isn't nearly as popular as twitter would have you believe", "No down vote cuz its 1000000% true. OP is def NOT TAH in this situation \nN even supposed \"fat shaming aside\" anyone who eats 800$ worth of someone else's food is automatically the AH thats a straight up d\u00a1ck move", "Ah just upvoted you. They know what they are doing and they do it on purpose. What I\u2019ve noticed is that irresponsible parents will encourage their kids to have the same bad habits so they don\u2019t look bad.", "Could not agree more.", "Not even the A at all.\n\nThat\u2019s just rude as fuck and no manners. The audacity of some people is astounding.", "Some people need to be told bluntly and straight up. At some point you gotta say fuck their feelings to get the point across", "You are spot on.", "Agree wholeheartedly.", "I budget for $200 a month for just myself and it's never junk food which is why it costs so much. I can't imagine buying $400 worth of frozen meals and then eating another $400 on top of that??? If I were OP, I'd either kick them out or put a lock on the pantry and freezer.", "As a college student who is not small by any means, and eats MUCH more than anyone else I know\u2026 I spend around $70 per week on groceries, and that\u2019s with picking out a ~$13 steak every time. $400 in a week is more than it would cost to eat out every meal.", "This! Especially EATING SOMEONE ELSES FOOD! It\u2019s one thing to blow through all your groceries, it\u2019s another to blow through someone else\u2019s when they were kind enough to let you and your kid live with them.", "Can, uh, children get heart attacks? Because that sounds like an awfully large amount of weight for a small child-size heart to sustain...", "Legit I wonder if her legs being sore is from swelling? I can\u2019t imagine her body feels good eating that much. I am in a small body and overeating is a license to gut rot for days for me\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab", "When I was in grad school my house mate would leave for the weekend and I\u2019d get high and eat all her snacks. I\u2019d go to the store before she got back and replaced all and more\u2026 I\u2019d always text her saying I was eating her stash and would replace. Even if she had like 2 Oreos left I\u2019d buy a whole new pack for her.", "yeah. it's really worrying the way people start blaming stuff like this on body positivity. body positivity is simply about treating people who aren't fit and skinny with equal respect.", "Same. Hubby and I are both overweight, but no way could we transform $800 worth of groceries into Mother Hubbard's Cupboard. The only time they weren't eating is when they were cooking or sleeping. \n\nThe adult... they are on their own, but I'm scared for that child. They are probably bullied relentlessly.", "I too am fluffy but I agree that is an insane amount of food in a week. Groceries no less! I mean a week in Disney I know we eat more but thats eating out all day. I cannot image eating that many calories in a single week.", "Why should she apologize though? \n\nThey are doing SIL a favour by letting her live there and all they ask is don't eat their food. And then she goes and eats 400 dollars worth in a week!\n\nI don't know why people have to tip toe around overweight people so much. She's abusing her child and eating a disgusting amount. Those are facts.", "My husband is 6 ft 5. He weighs more than 220. He still only wears a 34/36 pant and large shirts...mostly for length. So the kid could be only 6ft and it not be bad.", "She probably just didn\u2019t wanna have to worry about it when she got back", "So you don't need to go grocery shopping when you return? Last thing you want to do is come home and do chores", "Screw that. There are better ways, and that\u2019s not the way.", "What makes it fiction?", "Why do things need to be filtered through him? It\u2019s OP\u2019s home and food too.", "You're joking, right?", "I was about 220lbs at 12.\n\nOf course I'm a freaking giant and was already 6ft tall and a guy. I'm finding it hard to imagine a scenario where it makes sense that a 12 year old girl is healthy at 220lbs at 12. It can be ok for an adult, really depends on the woman and things like height or if they're a power lifter or a lot of other factors.\n\nI've never been skinny at all and even at my fittest and most active when I played organized sports, I've always been big, not just tall. I *know* I have not lived healthily for most of my life. I can't imagine living so badly that I would proportionally be like a 220lb 12 year old girl at any point of my life. The girl 100% inherited her issues with food from her mother.", "It\u2019s dangerous for anyone to be that size. I\u2019m 36 and weigh about 220 and am starting to actually worry about stuff like diabetes and blood pressure. She\u2019s literally abusing this child. Same as people who have morbidly obese pets. They think feeding them burgers is love and it\u2019s abuse", "I mean... IDK how you do anything else. We're a family of 4, and shop more or less exclusively at Aldi, buy hardly any meat, and still have a grocery bill of well over $400+ a month.\n\nNTA OP. NTA one little bit.", "Heck yeah, respect! No shame in the game, as long as you replace it!!", "Fellow munchie snacker and I do the same. Worth it for the convenience of high Oreos dipped in pb", "I\u2019m all ears", "There is a story on here almost every day where a fat person eats an obscene amount of food that isn't theirs, it is usually a staff party, breakroom refrigerator, or a roommate. The OP always has a clever zinger or insult for them. All the comments universally support OP and say how terrible the fat person is. It's very repetitive. \n\nIn this case, two people have eaten 800 dollars of groceries in less than a week. You can feed two people for a month for about half that, so for even the fattest of people, this is an incredible (and unbelievable) amount of food. The amount of food the fat person eats in these stories is always extremely exaggerated. These stories get tons of upvotes, so they are continually being posted.", "No.", "Fat shaming needs to come back into vogue for situations like this. Wow. Whats she is doing to herself is bad. Her kid though? Thats abuse. On your dime. No, just no.\n\nNTA OP", "I guess being single works out in some ways. My rent is atrocious but i dont have to buy food for anyone so i can get by with sleep for dinner", "Name checks out\ud83e\udd6c\ud83e\udee3", "It\u2019s directly relevant", "How are they the asshole in this situation? The core issue isn't even the weight of her SIL, the issue is how the SIL ate all the food in the house that should have lasted much longer.\n\nIt isn't fat shaming to yell at someone for eating all of your food", "Shame isn\u2019t a bad thing when your behaviour is shameful and needs changing.", "The kid should be taken away by CPS.\n\nThe SIL was an automatic asshole as soon as she let her 12 year old kid reach 220 pound's as far as I am concerned.", "First, I never said the OP was the asshole for being upset about the amount of food their guests ate. Nor did I accuse her of fat-shaming. Did I? No.\n\nMy comment was about how the OP was using body-positivity and fat-positivity as the reasons her relatives are obese. She wrote nothing about the fact that the relatives say that is why they are overweight and eat the way they do. OP is showing her ignorance about understanding those two things. Because if she did, she would understand that it is not about eating what you want, when you want, how much you want. It is not about making excuses or saying there is nothing wrong with being fat.\n\nI can understand why OP is upset about her food being eaten and the lack of boundaries. But throwing in \u201cbody-positivity\u201d and \u201cfat-positivity\u201d says an awful lot about her attitude and how she handled this situation.\n\nHer relatives are clearly going through something traumatic. Maybe one or both have atypical anorexia. Maybe they have a scarcity mindset. Maybe they don\u2019t need their relative coming on Reddit and putting them on blast.\n\nIt is too bad OP\u2019s relatives are in such a health state and there may be not much the mother is doing to help her so per doctors urgency.\n\nBut you know what? Both things can be true at the same time."]}
