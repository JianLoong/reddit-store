My mother\u2019s family is very traditional and religious and always believed I would be marrying a girl and are having a hard time adjusting.\n\nJ is a model. He often times where he\u2019ll model clothes on the more feminine-side and no one has a problem with it. My family have seen some of the photos and have often joked that J is \"pretty enough to be a girl\" which he would just laugh off as some joke.\n\nMy grandfather has offered to pay for the suits. The deal was he would get an opinion when it came to what our wedding suits would be since they were paying. J and I went on different days.\n\nFast forward, I\u2019m going to go pick up the suits from my aunt\u2019s place. Right away I can tell something\u2019s wrong. My suit is fine but J\u2019s is white. J was adamant saying he wanted a black suit so I asked my aunt why it was white but she said J chose it. I didn't believe her. Something was definitely off. J isn\u2019t a large guy or anything but this suit just looked far too small. I ask J about the suit when I get home and he just brushes it off. When I said it looked too small he looked a bit panicked and said he\u2019ll take care of it.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel maybe J was pressured into choosing white. He\u2019s a bit of a people pleaser so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me. I ended up looking up the suit online to see if I could order one in black and that if he liked it we could refund my grandfather. As it turns out, they ordered a woman\u2019s suit for him. I honestly thought it was a mistake at first and that maybe my grandfather somehow chose wrong so I asked J about it when he got home and he broke down.\n\nApparently my grandfather told J that every wedding needs someone in the bride role and since he\u2019s marrying into our family it should be him. My aunt had been pressuring J into losing weight to fit into the suit they bought for him and had convinced him their family would only accept him if he wore a white bridal one. And that\u2019s not even all, my grandaunt has been buying J a lot of hair accessories that are extremely feminine and has even suggested he get a new engagement ring.\n\nI\u2019ve never been so pissed. J said he didn\u2019t tell me about any of this because he just wanted to keep the peace and that just made me more upset. I ended up uninviting my them to our wedding. My mom called and demanded to know what happened and she was deeply shocked and ashamed when I told her what her everything and she says it\u2019s not acceptable but that they\u2019re having a hard time adjusting to this new kind of wedding. My cousins say if a suit was such a big deal then J should just wear a dress since he's used to wearing girl clothes. I uninvited them too.\n\nJ\u2019s family are all on my side. My mom says that I was overreacting by uninviting everyone that disagrees with me and that I should let them come if they apologize to J. I\u2019ll admit I was harsh but I also don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682884962, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1341hx7/aita_for_uninviting_my_family_to_my_wedding_after/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep them uninvited and your mom can stay away also if she doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re behavior was so bad. You\u2019re not overreacting or being harsh at all.\n\nOnly people who truly love and support you both should be there.

They bullied and insulted J, bought him a tiny woman's suit and told him to lose weight, and made a mockery of him/you both.  J can wear what he wants, including a nice black men's suit.
