My mother\u2019s family is very traditional and religious and always believed I would be marrying a girl and are having a hard time adjusting.\n\nJ is a model. He often times where he\u2019ll model clothes on the more feminine-side and no one has a problem with it. My family have seen some of the photos and have often joked that J is \"pretty enough to be a girl\" which he would just laugh off as some joke.\n\nMy grandfather has offered to pay for the suits. The deal was he would get an opinion when it came to what our wedding suits would be since they were paying. J and I went on different days.\n\nFast forward, I\u2019m going to go pick up the suits from my aunt\u2019s place. Right away I can tell something\u2019s wrong. My suit is fine but J\u2019s is white. J was adamant saying he wanted a black suit so I asked my aunt why it was white but she said J chose it. I didn't believe her. Something was definitely off. J isn\u2019t a large guy or anything but this suit just looked far too small. I ask J about the suit when I get home and he just brushes it off. When I said it looked too small he looked a bit panicked and said he\u2019ll take care of it.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel maybe J was pressured into choosing white. He\u2019s a bit of a people pleaser so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me. I ended up looking up the suit online to see if I could order one in black and that if he liked it we could refund my grandfather. As it turns out, they ordered a woman\u2019s suit for him. I honestly thought it was a mistake at first and that maybe my grandfather somehow chose wrong so I asked J about it when he got home and he broke down.\n\nApparently my grandfather told J that every wedding needs someone in the bride role and since he\u2019s marrying into our family it should be him. My aunt had been pressuring J into losing weight to fit into the suit they bought for him and had convinced him their family would only accept him if he wore a white bridal one. And that\u2019s not even all, my grandaunt has been buying J a lot of hair accessories that are extremely feminine and has even suggested he get a new engagement ring.\n\nI\u2019ve never been so pissed. J said he didn\u2019t tell me about any of this because he just wanted to keep the peace and that just made me more upset. I ended up uninviting my them to our wedding. My mom called and demanded to know what happened and she was deeply shocked and ashamed when I told her what her everything and she says it\u2019s not acceptable but that they\u2019re having a hard time adjusting to this new kind of wedding. My cousins say if a suit was such a big deal then J should just wear a dress since he's used to wearing girl clothes. I uninvited them too.\n\nJ\u2019s family are all on my side. My mom says that I was overreacting by uninviting everyone that disagrees with me and that I should let them come if they apologize to J. I\u2019ll admit I was harsh but I also don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682884962, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1341hx7/aita_for_uninviting_my_family_to_my_wedding_after/", "score": 153, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ultimately, though, we both know there is only one acceptable outcome here: that someday, she will be herself, and we\u2019ll only know her by her new name, and we\u2019ll just be laughing and hanging out like we always do. Because we are a family. So have your feelings, talk them out with mom and not with sister, and process them. Now. Because there\u2019s no point dragging out \u201csomeday\u201d longer than it needs to be.

Tell her plainly how it is, because she already knows even if she is pretending not to, and make it clear that the purpose of guests at a wedding is to affirm their support of the couple in their marriage.  People who aren\u2019t willing to do so of course should not be present. What would be the point?", "I don't think apologies would cut it. They deliberately humiliated and tormented J in a calculated way over time, and I'm willing to bet it was entirely to hurt him and amuse themselves. Bigots don't usually think being trans is a step in the right direction, so I don't believe for a minute that they were seriously wanting him to dress as a woman. They just wanted to torture and mock him.", "It's funny cause if OP's partner was trans, I'm sure they'd find it worse than him just being gay anyway. They want one of the dudes to be a woman in a gay relationship, but once someone starts transitioning, that's still a problem? LGBTQphobes gonna phobe.", "Few years ago my mom first understood homosexuality and would always ask me who was the male and who was the female whenever she came across homosexuality in media (we live in China). I always explained to her gently that it isn't how it always works. Sometimes one can be more feminine than the other but sometimes they can be both feminine or both masculine. It took her a while to understand this but she now accepts it as is.\n\nNothing wrong with being ignorant but everything wrong with being purposefully ignorant and prejudiced.", "To be silent in times of oppression is to side with the oppressor.", "This is her opportunity to face that fear. They are not in a position of authority of her anymore - grounding, spanking, withholding - what treatment are they going to give her other than unasked for options that she can stop immediately by removing herself from their commentary? Just as she is an adult, so are you, so she needs to shut down that pressure. With a lifetime of it, it will be hard to stand up for herself, but if there was ever a time to do it, it would be now.", "I\u2019d tell her - \u201cMom, I get it if you\u2019re not strong enough to stand up for me.  But I AM strong enough to stand up for J.  Stand with me.\u201d", "If J had written this post from his point of view there would be a lot of people telling him not to marry you. \n\nI had a friend who brought his partner to a family dinner, his family was of the \"men smoke in the sitting room after supper while the wives wash dishes type\" He(partner) wrongly assumed he would go with the men, but the family sent him to the kitchen and my friend didn't see the issue...later that night he(partner) drove himself home and no one has heard from him since. \n\n\nGood for you for being better than that! Hope you enjoy your big day."]}
