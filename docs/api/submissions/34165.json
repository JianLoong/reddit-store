I have atopic skin and if I don't use special creams I get all covered in extremely painful eczema. All these creams, shampoos, shower gels, and vitamins prescribed to me by my doctor are quite expensive, and I don't have much money of my own. I'm studying for college entrance exams all day long, and I don't have much time to work. \n\nMy boyfriend's sister really likes one of my creams that I use. She doesn't have eczema or anything, but she says this cream makes her skin softer. She's even bought this cream for herself before. But after she ran out of her cream, she asked if she could use mine. \n\nI knew she was having financial difficulties at the time, so of course I let her. Since I always try to use my creams sparingly because of their cost, I was a little embarrassed by how much of my cream she used each time, but I kept quiet so as not to seem petty and greedy to her. My cream did start running out twice as fast as usual though. \n\nSome time had passed since then and she had money again. However, she continued to use my cream. At first, I gently asked her if she could at least use my cream in smaller amounts. She looked offended, but said yes. But it was just words and she continued to use too much of my cream. I had bought this cream in a big jar and I had hoped to use it for a long time, but now it was almost running out. At one point I couldn't stand it and told her to buy her own cream. She agreed with me again. But a few days later, I wanted to grab the cream from my shelf and saw that she had used it again. Then something exploded inside me, and I even barely remember myself that I found the price of this cream on the internet and demanded her to reimburse me. \n\nShe was offended so much that she even cried. I felt extremely guilty. My boyfriend also now resents me for being greedy with his sister. I feel indebted to him and even more ashamed. \n\nEnglish is not my first language, I apologize if I spelled anything wrong", "created_utc": 1704183588, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wkgnz/aita_for_billing_my_boyfriends_sister/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re well within your rights to demand reimbursement and demand her to stop. I\u2019d suggest getting a small lock and key safe to keep in your room with all your meds in. Only you keep that key. \n\nBut there\u2019s a much bigger issue here sweetheart. You\u2019re so young and you\u2019ve been with and older man for a long time who took advantage of you in a vulnerable position. It doesn\u2019t matter how good your relationship is there is no reason a 15 year old should be an attractive prospective partner to a 27 year old. He is a grown ass man and you\u2019re a child in that position. There is no way that is healthy for you and you\u2019ve been through so much already. \n\nIf you can, consider if this is truly the relationship and situation you feel is right for you for the rest of your life if you intend to settle down. But you\u2019re young and have so much more to look forward to. \n\nYou are NOT indebted to a groomer. Ever. \n\nNTA. NTA. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nAnd OMG, aren\u2019t you used by those two.   \nGet out of there immediately. My heart aches knowing there is no responsible adult in your life.   \nYou are not indebted to your boyfriend. You are in a transactional relationship where, in exchange for sex, a man 12 years your senior, gives you the impression of taking care of you. You are cornered by two assholes into your humble angle believing you have no where else to go.\n\nGood luck. You deserve better.", "You started dating a 27 year old at 15? BOY..... That is not right. I don't care how in love you think you were, he took advantage of you. It's criminal.", "You're 18. He's 30 and you've been dating for 3 years?\n\nI'm sorry to tell you this but you're a grooming victim. I don't have to explain why a 27 year old dating a 15 year old is wrong.\n\nNTA but break off the relationship immediately.", "NTA\n\nShe's a jerk & then she has to nerve to be offended.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> **prescribed t**o me by my **doctor** are quite expensive\n\nShe is GREEDY. She should NOT have asked to use your prescribed creams anyway.", "Age difference aside, because that's a different issue, if you didn't want your boyfriend's sister using your stuff, leave them in the bedroom or hidden from her.", "NTA You asked her to use less, then to buy her own; she had multiple chances to stop at a reasonable point where it all could have been resolved nicely -- instead she continued to be greedy. You blew up because she ignored all of the polite warnings.\n\nRemind your boyfriend of this. It is his sister who was greedy. Will he pay to replace the cream and buy you a new one whenever his sister uses it up? No? Why? Is he greedy or only generous with your money?", "I don't know where you live, but where I am, a 27 year old man with a 15 year old boyfriend is a criminal.  You were extremely vulnerable, and you were taken advantage of.  And from the sound of it, you are still being taken advantage of.\n\nIs there any family member with whom you could live while you study for your exams?  I truly think that the situation with this cream just exemplifies the way your needs are ignored in that household.  Or would you consider working now so you could live elsewhere, and taking your entrance exams next year?\n\nI am so very sorry that you've gone through this.  Know that even 15 year old boys with solid families can be very vulnerable to older men; you did absolutely nothing wrong.  The adults around you failed you, yet here you are, getting ready for university.  Clearly, you have intelligence, strength and resolve.\n\nNow I very much hope you will use that strength and resolve to find away to get away from your boyfriend (I hesitate even to call him that) and his sister.  You will be so much better off.\n\nNTA\n\nEdited to correct the gender of the OP.", "Groomed much", "I\u2019m sorry you were 15 and 27 when you first started dating? And you see no problem with this whatsoever? You don\u2019t see that your \u201cBF\u201d groomed you?", "Girl he didn\u2019t look after you at 15. He groomed you. You have literally nothing in common with a man that age as an 18 or 15 year old. Run", "U started dating a 27 year old when u were 15 what the fuck", "Gross. Your boyfriend groomed you when you were in a vulnerable position. No 27 year old should have any interest in a 15yo.\n\nYTA", "You were manipulated and groomed into this relationship.  you\u2019re the victim here and should leave.

She kept using something that was prescribed for you and is expensive. You need to start having good boundaries. Calmly telling someone no is fine. Also remove the item when they aren\u2019t respectful of boundaries. Right now- talk to your boyfriend and calmly explain what went down. You flipped because you were disrespected by his sister. Simple as that. Ask him how he thinks you should handle it.", "NTA. Your boyfriend's sister is a greedy mooch.

You need to decide what's right and wrong. Others will always try to manipulate you to their will. Both of them benefit from the sister taking your cream, the only who who doesn't is you. \nI'd tell both your boyfriend and her sister to get fucked after she took the piss and exploited your trust by taking more than you were willing to give.\nBe careful who you lend your heart to, they don't always have your best interest in mind.

Apart from it being immoral and illegal for him to date you at 15, there is a HUGE imbalance in the relationship.  Are you truly equal?
