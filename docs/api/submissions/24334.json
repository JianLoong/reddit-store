At that point you won\u2019t be there to guide him and help him through understanding, and instead you will will have utterly destroyed his trust in you, so he won\u2019t be able to go to you for help.

With our 13yr old (we adopted a foster son we had in our care for over 3 yrs), when asking about his birth parents and backstory, some things are terrible & he doesn't need that on his brain.  I \\*also do not want him thinking his bio parents are \"safe\" in the way that other parents around him are. So what we have done over the years, is, either answer the question or tell him as much as is reasonable and push off the rest as \"pg-13\" or \"rated-R\".  That way he knows there is more to the story, but it isn't something he needs to be burdened to know while he is figuring himself out.  In that his parents actions do not define him. Not to mention, it isn't just his story, but his siblings & he isn't necessarily entitled to know all their trauma as a child, either.  Later, with established relationships with each other? Ok.\n\nSo, in this case, I would say something like, yes...we got a hit off Ancestry, but it is complicated and affects more than just you & us.  As a parent, I think the information is better shared at (13yr old, 16yo, whatever).  I personally think that I would give him the knowledge & talk cooperatively about what that might mean in the future.

Not telling him is one thing, but you took it too far with the lying.\n\nListen, OP. Every kid goes through a time in their life when who they thought they were and where they come from is revealed in some respect to be a big lie or not entirely true. The older you are when it happens, the more it fucks you up. I was in my *early thirties* when I learned some really hard truths about my mother and it's been years and I'm still not even close to over it. Had this all come out when I was 12? I would have grown up with it, known its contours, and learned to live with it. LLike I got to know some messed up stuff about my dad when I was probably 10 or so and sure, it sucked for a couple of years, but now my relationship with him was great. It never became some sort of identity crisis. Not like the stuff with my mom did.\n\nYou're not doing him any favors by keeping it from him.

On the other hand, having to explain to your 12yo that his dad was Mark's age when Mark was conceived, which would almost surely involve SA/misconduct of some kind, is a really, really hard pill to swallow.\n\nIf his dad were older and you didn't see any obvious red flags anywhere, I'd tell you to share the info with Mark while warning him that this guy might not respond or want any kind of relationship with him at all.\n\nBut given the actual circumstances, I don't see how sharing this info and/or reaching out to this guy would end well. If you're able to find out more about him, I would, but wouldn't necessarily share it with Mark unless there were extenuating circumstances.\n\nI think your instinct is the right one, but could bite you in the ass later if Mark eventually finds out you've been keeping this from him.

My parents assumed that i would find out he is gay and my cousins would be the ones to explain it to me. \n\nI'm no contact with my parents as this is just one example of a series of poor decision-making and bad parenting.", "Yes. It's not a common name. Not one in a million, but pretty rare for the US. We also had a location to go off from the profile that matches what's on his social media.", "Yeah, sounds like so much people were part of that conversation that there is no way this secret will stay secret for long", "Especially since you told other family members", "Exactly, it's only a matter of time until one of those other family members decides that he has the right to know and tells him anyway ... and then he'll find out that 1.) something likely very bad happened to his bio father when he was the same age the son is now, 2.) That he can't trust the parents who raised him.", "First off I agree with NTA - and second I don't even think you need to have children but remember how you hsve been as a kid and I second what you said.\n\nMy mom told me some family stories when I was a teen thinking that I knew them but didn't. Now I'm an adult and still struggle processing some of it but it took years to grasp it. Imagine telling a literal child that their bio parents was their age.... An adult can process stuff like this, but who knows how a child would think about this, imo it's a quite tough topic...", "I don't know anything about the story, but just from the math, it can't be anything good. Not that I thought it would be an ideal of course.", "I am an adoptee with a complex and tragic origin story. My advice is to tell him an age appropriate version of the events and add more facts as he ages. NO GOOD WILL COME FROM KEEPING THIS INFORMATION FROM HIM. NOW, read that again. The truth was not nearly as bad as the situations I conjured in my head. It\u2019s his story and the sooner he can incorporate it into his sense of self the better he will be.", "He knows he's adopted.", "That\u2019s pretty much where I am with my kids adopted from foster care. They no they\u2019re adopted but right now the reason is just \u201cthey weren\u2019t able to take care of you\u201d which is true but leaves out a lot. They\u2019ll get more as they get older and the full story eventually", "I never knew who my sperm donor was. My egg donor was bad enough.\n\nI had the chance to find out when I was 11.\n\nI decided I didn't want to know nor cared about him.", "No worries, they told the rest of the family. Someone will spill the beans in less than 6 months. It's a tough call, and I can see both sides", "I don't know that he does either.", "I think their issue is not that they\u2019re afraid the kid will want to meet the bio dad, it\u2019s that the bio dad was only 12 years old himself when the child was born. This can open up a huge can of worms, not just for the adopted parents, but for the kid and the bio parent as well. Sure, there\u2019s a chance that the child could have been born from a consensual relationship, but there\u2019s a high probability that was not the case. In this case, I\u2019m leaning more towards NAH.", "Only proper answer", "No they are not the asshole. That boy was 12-13 when he fathered that child. Do you understand how insane that is? What good will come of them telling their adopted child that his father was still just a child himself when the kid was born? It's better to wait until the boy is older.", "Technically it can find it. Won\u2019t be admissible in a court or anything, but it is fairly reliable as long as the place is reputable.\n\nMy aunt was listed as a 23% match for me so I would assume anything close to 50% would be pretty indicative to a parent. Not 100% proven, but very likely. Always possible for an error by the place or them in their snooping though.", "Gives six years for one of the family members you thought deserved this information to tell you son and destroy your relationship.", "The problem is you have this information NOW and one day your kid may learn that you HAD this information and that you didn't give it to them. What do you think their reaction is going to be? Despite your best intentions, you could very well be viewed as having betrayed their trust.  \n\n\nYou're in a tough spot and this is above Reddit's paygrade.", "Oh man. I get it. I'm sure they say \"but but but...\"\n\nBut they should have told you before anyone else.", "OK \n\nI know that DNA relatives are constantly popping up as \"new\" on my account, so you can \"take another look\" and find this person.\n\nThis is a real can of worms ...", "\"Three people can keep a secret if two are dead.\"", "Agreed wholeheartedly", "Yeah, the telling the whole family bit is... a decision. My nosy ass family would let that cat out of the bag in a month, tops. It probably wouldn't even be intentional. We just have too many group chats or someone would get tipsy and talk too loud. OP's kid is either going to find out soon from his father or another relative. It should come from his parents.", "The problem is the lie. Don't lie to your adopted kids about their parents. Full Stop. Are you adopted? Do you understand how damaging to a relationship a lie like this can be? And the fact that other family members know makes it even worse. Guarantee one of them will let it slip before the parents tell him.  This has the potential to destroy OP's relationship with his son.", "And just in case, shoot the last one too?"]}
