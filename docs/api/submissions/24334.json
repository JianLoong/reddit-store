With our 13yr old (we adopted a foster son we had in our care for over 3 yrs), when asking about his birth parents and backstory, some things are terrible & he doesn't need that on his brain.  I \\*also do not want him thinking his bio parents are \"safe\" in the way that other parents around him are. So what we have done over the years, is, either answer the question or tell him as much as is reasonable and push off the rest as \"pg-13\" or \"rated-R\".  That way he knows there is more to the story, but it isn't something he needs to be burdened to know while he is figuring himself out.  In that his parents actions do not define him. Not to mention, it isn't just his story, but his siblings & he isn't necessarily entitled to know all their trauma as a child, either.  Later, with established relationships with each other? Ok.\n\nSo, in this case, I would say something like, yes...we got a hit off Ancestry, but it is complicated and affects more than just you & us.  As a parent, I think the information is better shared at (13yr old, 16yo, whatever).  I personally think that I would give him the knowledge & talk cooperatively about what that might mean in the future.

Not telling him is one thing, but you took it too far with the lying.\n\nListen, OP. Every kid goes through a time in their life when who they thought they were and where they come from is revealed in some respect to be a big lie or not entirely true. The older you are when it happens, the more it fucks you up. I was in my *early thirties* when I learned some really hard truths about my mother and it's been years and I'm still not even close to over it. Had this all come out when I was 12? I would have grown up with it, known its contours, and learned to live with it. LLike I got to know some messed up stuff about my dad when I was probably 10 or so and sure, it sucked for a couple of years, but now my relationship with him was great. It never became some sort of identity crisis. Not like the stuff with my mom did.\n\nYou're not doing him any favors by keeping it from him.

If you're able to find out more about him, I would, but wouldn't necessarily share it with Mark unless there were extenuating circumstances.\n\nI think your instinct is the right one, but could bite you in the ass later if Mark eventually finds out you've been keeping this from him.

Not too long after that he found me on facebook, so I accepted his friend request. At the time I was over the moon to finally feel like I understood more about my story and my family history. Long story short, we messaged a couple times at first, but then it became clear as to why he was kept from me by everyone. He began to harass me online for not responding to him right away, claimed to be my father despite us having never met, would then harass friends of mine online trying to get to me, and at one point ended up threatening me and (unknown to them because I immediately blocked him after this) my adopted family. It turned out I was both his first born and apparently his only son after he had several girls, and he was trying to get me to come join his gang.

As much as your son has a right to know his story, sometimes fucked situations are better left being left alone, and there is a reason the majority of adoptions are closed.

As an adoptee with a traumatic biological family backstory, he deserves to know sooner. I'd say even by 13 or 14.

My parents told me a very sanitized (but factually true) version: my parents were young, and poor and already had a child, and knew they couldn't care for me, so they out me up for adoption so I could have a better life; until I was 10 or 11. At that point they started giving little bits of the tougher information: they were homeless, dropped out of 10 and 11th grade respectively, and that they had mental health issues. When I hit middle school they facilitated a couple screened letters from my bio mom and older brother, and gave me the rest of the story - drugs, prison, older bro in and out of foster care etc. It was painful, and I was angry they waited, but in hindsight I feel they timed it well. As an adult, I now have limited contact with my bio fam, and deeply appreciate that they told me as much as they could, as early as possible, and that they kept the tougher information for when I was a little more mature. If they'd waited until I was 18 it would have been permanently hurtful to me to know they waited so long, and finding out the dark stuff would've still been traumatic anyway. \n\nTLDR: in my experience, it's always going to hurt to find out painful bio family information, but easing into it in bits over time, and getting the full truth out as soon as possible builds trust and allows you to help your kid set healthy boundaries while still feeling that you're not keeping it secret. 18 IS TOO LATE\n\nEdited to add: I was in therapy from the age of 6 and my parents and therapists worked together whenever they were introducing new information so I had private time and space in therapy to process, and we had family therapy sessions to process, ask questions, introduce the new info etc. Having a separate, non-parent, adult who I could speak to in confidence and get healthy support and process independently was absolutely a huge help", "Then you should have a plan for telling him.

Or that he might not know you exist at all.\" \n\nParents sometimes need to explain complex things to kids, especially in situations like adoption where their story may be _very_ complex. \n\nKids would in general much rather have an age appropriate explanation of something complex, than find out when they're older that you chose to lie to them in order to remove any choices or agency they might have had. \n\nWhat if in a few years, the kid finds out they knew his bio dad was out there and contactable, but he has since died so he lost that chance? What if he assumes that bio dad deliberately avoided doing any ancestry tests in order to not be found, and later find out he did exactly the opposite and was hoping the DNA testing system would connect him with a child he never got to know. \n\nIt's important for them not to sugar coat or get his hopes up for a magical family reunion, and it's important that they prepare him for the possibility that his bio dad has no interest. \n\nBut if you're going to let an adopted child who doesn't know their ancestry do a DNA test, you HAVE to be prepared that will uncover difficult things you will then have to explain to them.

I think (but that\u2019s just my personal opinion) that it\u2019s fine if he gets in touch when he\u2019s 18, assuming that his donors are even open to that. His bio-parents are not his parents.

But in a comment mention something about maybe telling him when he's 18. \n\n1) Good chance someone slips before he's 18. If you wanted it to be a secret than sharing it with your family is a mistake. Expecting multiple people to keep a secret for 6 years is not a smart idea. The whole family will find out. You tell Mom, Dad and Siblings. Mom, Dad and Siblings will tell their family. Your aunts and uncles will know. Your cousins will know. His aunt an uncles will know. His cousins will know. Grandma and Grandpa will know. Everyone but him will know, until eventually he finds out too, and not in the way you want. Do you want him finding out from a cousin at 16 that you found this information 4 years ago and kept it from him that whole time? You shouldn't have told your family first, you should have told him first. However, now that your family knows you should listen to them and tell him, and hope you can handle the damage control if he finds out everyone else learned before he did. \n\n2) **When** (Not If) he finds out you sat on this information for 6 years he's not going to be happy about it. That would be 6 years of you lying to your son about something important. Think about how you would feel if you found out someone was lying to you about important stuff for 6 years. I assure you Happy and Thankful are not the feeling, more like Betrayed and Distrustful. It gets you thinking \"If they lied about this for YEARS what else have they been lying about? Can I trust them at all with anything they've ever told me? They told the whole family but me, can I trust them with my secrets?\" This could shatter the view he has of you, and this is one area where I don't think the trust can be easily rebuilt, if at all. And as a teen, when we're rash and hot headed? You're creating a disaster here. \n\n3) Adopted children struggle with identity issues and often find a lot of solace in learning about their bio-family. Even in cases where they can't meet them, just knowing and being able to learn about them can do wonders for them. Are you sure this is something you want to force on your son when you can give him this connection? From his perspective that 6 of his formative years GONE when he could have been building a connection with his bio-father. Or 6 years of holding out hope for something that will never happen, but because you held on to the secret he held on to false hope for a relationship that will never be. Either way, it's six years of being manipulated by your lies. There's no way to look at it where you come out the good guy. \n\nNot exactly an unpopular opinion, but I hate being lied to. The bigger the lie the more I hate it. This is a pretty big lie. I'd be pretty mad if I learned this at 18, and then learned that you sat on it for 6 years.

If his bio dad was older I would tell him now but I think you should wait until he is 18. He could certainly handle it now but the father being so young I think it would be best to wait a few years. Are you 100% sure you have the right person?", "YTA. Not because you did not tell your son about his bio dad but because the rest of the family knows. Someone will tell him. You and DH need to figure out an age appropriate way to explain what you know, just the facts. You may have to explain why contacting this young man may be very traumatic for the bio father. You should have kept quiet to your family. If you are not prepared for what DNA may reveal do not take the test.", "I FOUND my adoption papers last year at age 21. He will find out. There is no way to hide this eventually he will need certain documents perhaps a birth certificate in which case I don\u2019t have. I have my adoption papers. \n\nI don\u2019t resent my parents, this is because they love me and all I have ever known was them. But this may be rare as many other people don\u2019t take it well. \n\nYou need to tell him. Asap.", "You\u2019re going to regret this choice. These days 12 yr old are more mature than you were. It\u2019s your responsibility as his parents to have this difficult conversation with him. You\u2019re scared and I understand that. I hope he forgives you", "I think you should\u2019ve told him the truth because eventually he\u2019s gonna find out and when he does, he\u2019s going to feel like you guys really  were not there for him. Trust me on this. In this day and age it\u2019s not like 25 years ago. He needs to know the truth even if it hurts him.", "YTA - you told people besides your son, they don\u2019t agree with your decision.  You better tell your son before he hears the truth from somewhere else because you out that put there and it\u2019s going to get back to him.  A secret can sometimes be kept between 2 people, 3 or more and you are screwed.  Tell him, it\u2019s better to hear it from you than to find out the truth and his parents lied about it.", "I think you have good intentions, but YTA\n\nI recommend you read the stories and perspectives of adult adoptees. Because a lot of them describe feeling severe betrayal and hurt when they learn their adoptive family kept info about their bio relatives from them.", "I was adopted through an agency when I was about 1 month old. The agency provided my adoptive parents with documents about ethnicity, family medical history, and interview questions about themselves.\n\nI would say withholding the full situation from your son isn't a bad idea at his age, but kids aren't as fragile as we think they are. You mentioned he's taken an interest in ancestry, that tells me he is looking for answers about his biological origins. As an adopted kid, it's always in the back of our minds that the reason we were given up is probably bad. So it's not like it would be totally unexpected if he learned that his biological father was so young when he was conceived. \n\nHowever, I think your fear is taking the wheel a bit that you've already made up a scenario about the biological mother's situation in regards to what happened with the father without knowing the facts yourself. \n\nIt's my opinion that as adoptive parents, you should try to reach out to the biological father, if only for the sake of your son. You may not get any reply, which is answer enough, or you may get more information surrounding your son's conception. It's also your role to take care of your child's health and the biological father may have important genetic information to share about family medical history.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, I hope things go well with whatever course of action you choose as his parents!", "OP, you needs to nip this in the bud, fast. The longer you wait, the longer you'll have been hiding it from him, and the more his resentment might be when he learns the truth. Even worse- if he hears it from someone who isn't you, he'll learn that he can't trust you.\n\nI'm no psychologist, but I feel like the only thing you can do now is sit him down before someone else slips up and tells him. Before breaking the news, apologize for lying to him, and say that it wasn't to try to hide it, but because you panicked and were trying to protect him, since the news could be upsetting. If he sees that you are genuinely sorry for lying and only did it to protect him, then maybe he won't hold it against you as badly as he would if he learned it secondhand (and after more time passes). It's hard to admit you made a mistake, but it's important for kids to see that their parents are willing to admit mistakes rather than double-down.\n\nThen, you'll have to tell him. Don't jump to conclusions and assume the worst, but being honest as much as you can with him could win back some of his trust in you. As a 12 y/o, he's got to learn about the harsh reality of the world at some point, but, if he trusts you, he might want you to be with him on his journey to find closure, whatever that may look like. \n\nSoft YTA for the initial lie and then telling your family, but this could be salvageable if you get ahead of it before one of them blabs to him and he starts to distrust you.", "YTA. It\u2019s always a bad idea to lie to adoptees. \n\nVery often the truth is difficult - few children are relinquished from happy situations, and some situations are less happy than others. Sometimes we have to soften the truth or leave out details in an age appropriate manner. Sometimes we need professionals to help us with the hard conversations. But trust is essential for the adoptee. Lying violates that. \n\nThat said: wtf were you thinking, sharing his private personal history with others????? You can\u2019t do that. You should know you can\u2019t do that. This is his, and you cannot share it without his permission. It\u2019s not right. So extra special double YTA for that detail. \n\nYou need to come clean ASAP before this blows up in your face. I recommend the assistance of a family counselor, since you\u2019ve already headed down a bad path.", "YTA- As others have said, you revealed this information to other family members whilst lying to your son's face. He's going to find out, people talk or slip up, and this will be such a betrayal in your son's eyes that he may never forgive you and may never trust you again. \n\nAs an adoptee myself, it genuinely sucks to be the last one to know things about yourself. I was 10 years old when I was told, and it was only because my 6 year old brother was having trouble keeping the secret after our mother told him. There's no reason for other members of your family to be privy to this information at all. \n\nAnd I understand your main desire is to protect your son, as the age of his biological father is a concern, but I don't think you're giving your son enough credit. Kids are far more perceptive and understanding than they're given credit for. I genuinely believe there's a way this could be explained to him gently for him to understand the situation and why contact now may not be appropriate. He could at least know it's an option for after he turns 18. From experience, it's far more traumatizing to have information like this thrown at you and not be prepared when things start banging down your door. \n\nI also did an ancestry test, and that's how I ended up finding out who my biological father was. I don't know if all services are the same in this regard, but mine notifies me via email when I get DNA matches, and I can see how we're related. Something you need to consider here is that it's entirely possible your son's biological father may end up seeing that result on his end and reaching out to make contact himself. That's something your son needs to be prepared for, even if he can't reach out on his own yet or has no desire to in the future.  I can't imagine the irreparable tatters your relationship would be in if that situation were to unfold, and he found out later that you lied and kept everything from him.", "YTA , the truth alway has a way of getting out. He\u2019s gonna know you lied to him but told everyone else in the family. Someone will spill it, today, tomorrow who knows. Now it lingers in your head, just waiting for that other shoe to drop. Will he question everything you ever told him? Who knows? Will he ever trust you again? I have a feeling your gonna find out the hard way.", "NTA for not telling him, but you shouldn't have told anyone else.\n\nOn a related note, there is approximately a 100% chance that one of those busybodies will tell your son sooner or later.

I only say this because they do mess up. I am on a DNA site and had a random man show up as my cousin. My family freaked the heck out. Come to find out for one of the aunts, it was our second cousin who never met his dad's family. Only older relatives knew about him. We reached out and had it corrected. I only say this because the 24 year old could be an uncle, not a dad.\n\nNAH. This is a tricky situation.

He would probably stay polite, but I would lose everything that I treasure in having him in my life.\n\nNow. Go figure out how to fix this.\n\nBTW ...

So I'm not sure knowledge and contact are as separate as would be ideal. The only way I see around that is for OP to reach out to bio dad first, which may give him the heads-up to turn his profile private . . .

If biological mom/dad aren't in the database, there's nothing to compare it to. The program might assign \"father\" because of the 13 yr age difference and the lack of another option.", "NTA. The fact that you told other relatives makes this awkward and raises the possibility that your son will have to hear this sad story sooner than you might like, but I can\u2019t consider you TA for that because you surely were not expecting to learn what you did\u2014and similarly, I suspect someday he\u2019ll understand why you didn\u2019t tell him til he was older. Best of luck to you & your wife and son.", "YTA . WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU TELL OTHER PEOPLE? So everyone would know but him? That's fucked up. You better tell him before a family member does.  Because you've risked your relationship with your son by lying and telling people. Had you kept it to yourself til his older fine. But that's not what you did. Smh .", "YTA. Please tell your son the truth. The longer you keep it from him, the harder it is gonna be for him to ever trust you again. He's 12, not 2.

This is WAY above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. Get a good child psychologist\u2019s help and figure out how to break the news to your kid, because with other family members in the know and disagreeing with the decision to withhold the info, the odds he doesn\u2019t find out, and soon, are *minuscule*. \n\nTelling your family that you\u2019re going to tell him but want the advice of a child psychologist specializing in dealing with complex issues like this first so you can make sure to minimize the detrimental impact on him of finding out that his origins are likely terrible is likely to help convince them to keep their mouths shut \u2014 for now. They won\u2019t stay silent forever waiting for you to break the news first.", "NTA it's very likely that neither the son or his bio dad are in a place to handle this situation. You should have two plans in place. One to tell him when he is older at say 18, and two what to tell him if he finds out before then.

No. \nMy son comes from a very sad situation, and I would like for him to be a child as long as possible.

Now everyone but your son knows.", "YTA, yeah there's no way this'll blow up in your faces haha", "YTA.  While I understand that not all information is appropriate to share with a 12yo, sharing it with your family and lying to him is really wrong.  Also, there is a difference between telling him an age appropriate version of the truth vs. lying.  I think the right thing to do was figure out a way to be honest in an age appropriate way.  Because eventually he will find out that you lied.  And even worse if he finds out you told other people the truth and not him\u2026. He\u2019s likely going to feel betrayed.", "NAH-\nFirst of all this is way over Reddit\u2019s pay grade.\nSecond: There\u2019s nothing wrong with not wanting to tell him, but you DID mess up by telling other family members. \nThey could tell him any day and there\u2019s *nothing* you can do about it. \nIf he does get mad at you someday when you do tell him the truth (in that case you got lucky that no one squeaked) he might be more mad that other family knew than anything. I know I\u2019d be.", "OK. This is a tough one. First off, you shouldn\u2019t have told anyone else, your son should have been first to know. The very tricky part here is, is he really ready to know the story and is his dad ready to even share the story?  This is something that you should talk to a therapist about. \n\nOn a personal note, my mother had a child when she was a teen - he was the result of her father abusing her. We\u2019re all adults now and, if he were to ever find me and ask me about his parents, I really don\u2019t know what I would say. How do you tell someone they\u2019re the product of abuse?", "Yes YTA for lying and telling other family members. I grew up like that. Everyone knowing the family secret except me. It was definitely damaging to my relationship with my family. The lie definitely hurt more than the truth. But, I also understand there is the need to protect him from some seriously heavy truth.

And yes, growing up, before DNA, our family did the whole ancestry thing (a cousin is allegedly Jesse James, for example). \n\nBut your family IS HIS FAMILY.\n\nas far as I am concerned, doing his DNA is this age was always, always going to open a can of worms, regardless of the age of his bio father. \n\nso YTA but not for the other reasons folks say, imo.", "Your kid will find out.  You really should have waited till he was 16 to do this.  But he will find out, if he hasn\u2019t already figured a way around getting access, he will.  Lies never work out well, especially if others are in on the lies.  \n\nI think you all need to seek a therapist and find out the best way to communicate this news.  You may want to reach out to the father and see what you can find out firsthand, or hire a private investigator, so that you can learn as much as possible.", "You have absolutely no idea how your son came to be, at that young age there could be some serious trauma involved. Bio-dad may not even know your son exists. When your son's older, it's certainly something to talk about fully, but this could be hugely upsetting at his age and emotional maturity. You're doing your job as a parent. He won't be happy when you tell him but that can't be avoided. NTA", "Yta- why even take the test. He clearly wants to know and will be pissed when he finds out. This guy should get the chance to meet his son before its too late.", "YTA for lying about something so important. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "I say your son needs to know. The fact that his 13 year old father was smart enough to place him for adoption shows a level of compassion, and the fact that dad is on the dna site tells me hes looking. Its either now while you can help him adjust or in 5 years when he can do all this on his own and will be pissed you hid it from him", "YTA simply because you told everyone besides the one person who has the right to know.", "You have to tell him now...because some family member will for sure!", "It\u2019s no longer a secret if your family knows, so YTA.  \n\nI recommend that you speak to a family therapist and ask for guidance on how to discuss this with him.", "YTA. Your child has the right to know about the their biological family members. You can hide it from him now but he can and will find out when he\u2019s an adult if he chooses. You\u2019ll wish you had told him sooner because it will no doubt cause problems in the future.", "But if the father was found because he submitted his own DNA \u2014 either he doesn\u2019t know he fathered a child at 12 or else he does know and wants to be found.", "Are you 100% certain the person you found on Facebook is the bio dad (If I go to Facebook and search for any friend or family member's name, there are a million options to choose from if I didn't know what someone looked like.)", "Yta. When he finds out (& he will, youve told others), he is going to be so hurt & so angry. You say you want to protect him, from what?! Its his story, his truth, his blood line, his right. I am sure all the reasons hes imagined are far worse than his truth. But this is his story. His life, his identity. Rather he knows it all or not. I do foster care/kinship, not one person has ever said (to me or anyone i know) that they are glad their parents hid info from them. But guess how many are angry that they did?!!! Just abt all. Telling him that his dad was so young, too young to care for him, isn't something that is going to crush him, will probably even be a relief to know. I don't think this is going to end well for op", "I totally get not wanting to tell him at this age. \nY'all flubbed when rest of family now knows because chances are its going to come out.\nPerhaps a we did find some info but are trying to figure out exactly how it all goes toghether or something vague like that.\nI also agree with therapy may not be a bad idea because this is not quite a Reddit question", "You should tell him. It's better coming from you. The truth is already out. Too many people know and they don't agree with your decision to not tell him. It's only a matter if time before their need to do what they feel is right takes over. Someone is going to tell him. Sit him down yourselves....privately.", "Posting here because OP needs to see it.\n\nThey might have located their son's older brother and not his Dad. Shared DNA would be about 50% for both.", "Totally agree, I would also question if  it's even the right person because looking someone up on social media really means nothing. OP also assumes this prospective father is even aware they are a father", "We have the settings as private as possible.", "I think the only \u2018wrong\u2019 thing they did was telling other family members.\nIf they\u2019re anything like *my* family, that kid\u2019s gonna find out the moment any of them have one too many drinks or a member decides their opinion is better than OP\u2019s and jumps the gun.", "We have no information on the biological mother. We don't even have a jumping off point to message any of the distant cousins.", "We have thought about this one.

For half siblings, the percentage is something like 12-25%. \n\nWe want this to be the case, but from what we understand, it isn't likely.", "Not what they meant and you know it.", "It's entirely possible that you found his older brother.", "Except it's probably not his father. It's probably a brother or half brother.", "The range for a full sibling is generally recognized as being between 37% and 61%. I don't know what information you have which makes this less likely, just wanted to put in here that a full sibling can definitely still share more than 50% DNA. Look at identical twins.", "I actually share like 51.7% DNA with my younger brother, according to 23 and me. Why would it be unlikely? \n\nMy brothers are 12 years apart and I think the initial report tried to make them father/son.

If they're siblings then they should.", "This is the biggest sticking point for me.\n\nTelling other family members but withholding the information from the child? You've made the entire family complicit in concealing it now. What happens if there's a miscommunication and one of your family members reveals this to him?\n\nHe doesn't need every single detail. But you should seek out a therapist and address what you know now, rather than wait and risk the information coming out in a way that might cause real harm.", "I knew someone years ago in a somewhat similar situation. He knew for most of his life that his birth mom was around 13 when she had him. He only learned after 18 that his birth father was almost certainly his bio grandfather, and his b. mother took her own life as a teen. Messed up his self-perception for years (he admitted it was hard not to see himself as a mistake/abomination whose existence destroyed his b. mom's life). He had come to terms with it by the time I met him (in his thirties) but it took a lot of introspection and therapy. \n\nOP shouldn't be keeping this secret forever, but he's not wrong to want to tread lightly around dumping this info on son. Son is a little young to process this without more information and professional guidance.", "I don't think I could possibly go to a potential rape victim and inform them of the child that's a result of their attack. What if it retraumatizes them?", "Yeah that\u2019s why the idea of contacting the father is REALLY touchy. If he were in his late 20\u2019s and fathered the kid at something like 16-17, it\u2019s more likely to think maybe it was a consensual but ill-advised teenage encounter with a peer, but at 12 that\u2019s extremely unlikely. \n\nThe rest of the family should not have been told anything about this. Now they\u2019re busybodies with info that could be extremely damaging if they decide to blab. Even moreso if they tell the kid that his parents lied and don\u2019t explain that the situation is delicate and they mean well but [other fam] think the kid deserves to know.", "What if  he's in the DNA database because he suspects or knows and is desperate to find his child?\n\nBesides the OP can always say \"We got a DNA match that was close to yours, or something that gives him an out if he doesn't want to accept it.", "Then he can make that first step. All matches get the notifications and most DNA kits like this have a messaging system for cases like this. If I were OP, I would have kept it under wraps until the biodad reached out or the kid was a little older."]}
