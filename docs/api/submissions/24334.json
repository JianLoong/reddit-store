At that point you won\u2019t be there to guide him and help him through understanding, and instead you will will have utterly destroyed his trust in you, so he won\u2019t be able to go to you for help.

With our 13yr old (we adopted a foster son we had in our care for over 3 yrs), when asking about his birth parents and backstory, some things are terrible & he doesn't need that on his brain.  I \\*also do not want him thinking his bio parents are \"safe\" in the way that other parents around him are. So what we have done over the years, is, either answer the question or tell him as much as is reasonable and push off the rest as \"pg-13\" or \"rated-R\".  That way he knows there is more to the story, but it isn't something he needs to be burdened to know while he is figuring himself out.  In that his parents actions do not define him. Not to mention, it isn't just his story, but his siblings & he isn't necessarily entitled to know all their trauma as a child, either.  Later, with established relationships with each other? Ok.\n\nSo, in this case, I would say something like, yes...we got a hit off Ancestry, but it is complicated and affects more than just you & us.  As a parent, I think the information is better shared at (13yr old, 16yo, whatever).  I personally think that I would give him the knowledge & talk cooperatively about what that might mean in the future.

Not telling him is one thing, but you took it too far with the lying.\n\nListen, OP. Every kid goes through a time in their life when who they thought they were and where they come from is revealed in some respect to be a big lie or not entirely true. The older you are when it happens, the more it fucks you up. I was in my *early thirties* when I learned some really hard truths about my mother and it's been years and I'm still not even close to over it. Had this all come out when I was 12? I would have grown up with it, known its contours, and learned to live with it. LLike I got to know some messed up stuff about my dad when I was probably 10 or so and sure, it sucked for a couple of years, but now my relationship with him was great. It never became some sort of identity crisis. Not like the stuff with my mom did.\n\nYou're not doing him any favors by keeping it from him.

On the other hand, having to explain to your 12yo that his dad was Mark's age when Mark was conceived, which would almost surely involve SA/misconduct of some kind, is a really, really hard pill to swallow.\n\nIf his dad were older and you didn't see any obvious red flags anywhere, I'd tell you to share the info with Mark while warning him that this guy might not respond or want any kind of relationship with him at all.\n\nBut given the actual circumstances, I don't see how sharing this info and/or reaching out to this guy would end well. If you're able to find out more about him, I would, but wouldn't necessarily share it with Mark unless there were extenuating circumstances.\n\nI think your instinct is the right one, but could bite you in the ass later if Mark eventually finds out you've been keeping this from him.

Some adopted children feel rejected by their bio family. But your son is about the same age as his bio dad was. So he would be able to relate to how it would feel to be a parent at his age. Then his abandonment at the hospital could be perceived as an act of love towards him. Two dumb kids exploring their sexuality at a young age is forgivable, assuming bio mom was the same age.

I'm adopted and had an open adoption, though I wasn't told much of anything about my birth father by my adoptive parents or the birth mother I have somewhat of a relationship with. All I knew was that he was a younger teen when I was born and he lived somewhere near by. When I turned 18 I was told virtually everything about him and found out that he was a gang member who wasn't willing to do what was needed to be a father. Not too long after that he found me on facebook, so I accepted his friend request. At the time I was over the moon to finally feel like I understood more about my story and my family history. Long story short, we messaged a couple times at first, but then it became clear as to why he was kept from me by everyone. He began to harass me online for not responding to him right away, claimed to be my father despite us having never met, would then harass friends of mine online trying to get to me, and at one point ended up threatening me and (unknown to them because I immediately blocked him after this) my adopted family. It turned out I was both his first born and apparently his only son after he had several girls, and he was trying to get me to come join his gang. I was out of state at the time for college so in no world was that happening. As much as your son has a right to know his story, sometimes fucked situations are better left being left alone, and there is a reason the majority of adoptions are closed. Sometimes it really is a parent not being able to provide the best situation for a child but doing the math in this situation I don't see where a story involving a 12 year old father is a pretty one. Old wounds were opened for my birth father through us establishing contact and entirely new fears and wounds were created for me, and from personal experience it isn't always better to know the full picture. Your kid loves you and you are his parents to him, even if he knows he is adopted. Even giving so much as a name now can lead to something similar happening between your son and his biological father down the line because the temptation will absolutely be there on your sons end if he has that much information to go off of.", "Agreed.

It is his right to know about his background and he should have the final say with this information.

Once again seek therapy to advise how best to handle potential issues with the biological family.  Your son deserves the opportunity to learn about his past.

I would come clean and tell him the truth.", "18 is too old. There's no age where this information won't be traumatic. As an adoptee with a traumatic biological family backstory, he deserves to know sooner. I'd say even by 13 or 14. WHEN he finds out that you withheld this information, even for his own good, it's going to hurt. My parents told me a very sanitized (but factually true) version: my parents were young, and poor and already had a child, and knew they couldn't care for me, so they out me up for adoption so I could have a better life; until I was 10 or 11. At that point they started giving little bits of the tougher information: they were homeless, dropped out of 10 and 11th grade respectively, and that they had mental health issues. When I hit middle school they facilitated a couple screened letters from my bio mom and older brother, and gave me the rest of the story - drugs, prison, older bro in and out of foster care etc. It was painful, and I was angry they waited, but in hindsight I feel they timed it well. As an adult, I now have limited contact with my bio fam, and deeply appreciate that they told me as much as they could, as early as possible, and that they kept the tougher information for when I was a little more mature. If they'd waited until I was 18 it would have been permanently hurtful to me to know they waited so long, and finding out the dark stuff would've still been traumatic anyway. \n\nTLDR: in my experience, it's always going to hurt to find out painful bio family information, but easing into it in bits over time, and getting the full truth out as soon as possible builds trust and allows you to help your kid set healthy boundaries while still feeling that you're not keeping it secret. 18 IS TOO LATE\n\nEdited to add: I was in therapy from the age of 6 and my parents and therapists worked together whenever they were introducing new information so I had private time and space in therapy to process, and we had family therapy sessions to process, ask questions, introduce the new info etc. Having a separate, non-parent, adult who I could speak to in confidence and get healthy support and process independently was absolutely a huge help", "Then you should have a plan for telling him.
