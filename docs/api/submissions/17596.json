First they stereotyped you.  Second, what they said was anti semitic.

This originates in the Middle Ages when the Church forbade Christians to lend money while charging interest (a practice called usury, although the word later took on the meaning of charging excessive interest). Jews were legally restricted to occupations usually barred to Christians and thus many went into money-lending. This led to, through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the association of Jews with greedy practices.\" Wiki", "NTA - even if you were Jewish, what a stupid thing to say in the workplace, you could easily get them written up for stuff like that.

They are stereotyping, but they are stereotyping Jewish people rather than you in particular, so personally while I get the anger at the constant misidentification, I think the anger should be more directed at the fact they are basing their judgements of you on their own prejudiced beliefs of Jewish people rather than you, if that makes sense?
