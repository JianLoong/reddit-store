Not necessarily. But honestly you're kind of a superhero in that way.

We love that for you. \n\n(Noting that I'm not saying it's okay for you to be mistreated under the assumption of Jewish heritage,  just that it kind of makes you awesome, that you have this power to help fight anti semites.)", "This is all just so strange that this is happening to you, in this day and age. I\u2019m  like an 8th Jewish on my mom\u2019s side, but grew up catholic; my dad\u2019s side is pure Anglo Saxon, but with a last name that a lot of Jewish people also have. I grew up in a big city in Texas, and being a Southern city in the time I was growing up, there was a definite consciousness of a racial difference between black and white, as stupid as that was. But there was no similar consciousness of Jewish people being a different race from white people, it was more like about the religious differences, and really more a curiosity than anything else, like \u201coh, you\u2019re Jewish? I\u2019m catholic\u201d just like someone might have said to me \u201coh, you\u2019re catholic? I\u2019m Methodist.\u201d  That, and we were jealous our Jewish friends and classmates got 8 days of Hanukkah to our 1 day of Christmas, was about all we really thought about it. \n\nBut then I went off to college, and I was surprised by how many people from places like New York and Southern California seemed very conscious of a perception of \u201cotherness\u201d about Jewish people. And I got a lot of people assuming I was Jewish, I guess because of the name and my coloring? And it seemed really important to them, to categorize me as Jewish. It really intensified when I got an apartment with two fraternity brothers of mine, one was half Jewish with a very Jewish last name, but actually an Episcopalian, and the other a nonobservant Jewish guy from Chicago. There were a lot of jokes bandied about the three of us in the fraternity house, our apartment being \u201cthe law firm\u201d (none of us was pre law),when we threw a party at our place \u201care you serving manischewitz? Will the snacks be kosher?\u201d  I was like \u201cI\u2019m from the South, but you Yankees are the real racist ones.\u201d This was all almost 30 years ago, I\u2019d have hoped things would be different now, I\u2019m sorry to hear this kind of antisemitic profiling still goes on in places. NTA.", "Wonder what HR would think of his joke. Nta at all", "This! Also money-lending was a portable trade so when the pogroms every other decade happened, they could up and escape without having to leave everything behind. Most crafts and skills were dominated by guilds that explicitly banned Jews too, so they couldn\u2019t apprentice or safely trade goods they\u2019d made either. Hence money-lending was the best option for multiple reasons as well as the religious condemnation. \n\nBut the cases of the doctors warning about possible diseases is understandable on their part - there are a ton of genetic conditions that pretty much only Ashkenazi Jews need to know about (and test for before having kids ideally) so they kinda are doing their jobs if they suspect someone may be at risk (it\u2019s come up quite a bit for donor-conceived children, who didn\u2019t know because they weren\u2019t raised by Jewish parents, that if the sperm donor was Ashkenazi they need to know that for medical history purposes) but as OP\u2019s had a dna test, then they\u2019ll just have to make that clear if their doctor starts talking about Tay Sachs or something \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", ">Jews were legally restricted to occupations usually barred to Christians and thus many went into money-lending.
