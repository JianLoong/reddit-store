At the time obviously she would not know how much I would come to dislike it 20 years later. My name is Karen.  Yep, most of you are probably laughing now :(\n\nAs some may imagine, every day I and my name are made fun of. I have started using another name when I order a coffee or doordash. Anything in public where they call out my name. I begged my boss to allow me to change the name on my nametag because even customers would ask me if I was a \u201cgood K\u2026..\u201d or a \u201ccrazy K\u2026..\u201d. I\u2019ve been called everything from a racist to a psychopath simply because of my name. Is it ridiculous and childish? Absolutely. Will people ever stop using my name (and millions of other people\u2019s name) for everything hateful? I doubt it. I have no faith in humanity at this stage.\n\nSo that is the main reason I want to change my name. My Mom and I have had a few major fights over this. I feel so guilty every time it is mentioned because she loves and misses her sister so much and she gave me the name out of pure love (funnily enough \u201cpure\u201d is what it actually means). She is not on social media so she doesn\u2019t understand how bad it is. Every day I am mocked, made of fun of and if I complain, I am told that it is such a K\u2026.  thing to do. I have no voice and I am so depressed about it (I\u2019m in therapy once a week).\n\nI hate arguing with my Mom and I have come up with similar names but she won\u2019t budget and refuses to discuss it now. I don\u2019t care if she still calls me K\u2026.. , but she says I am dishonoring her and her sister if I went through with it. My Dad doesn\u2019t care either way really and some of my friends think I am too sensitive, but they aren\u2019t the ones whose name is a blanket name for all things hateful. I would still instantly and automatically feel ick anytime I saw someone making fun of the name but at least I could hide much better.
