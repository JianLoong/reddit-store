I missed him terribly and didn't know how to reconnect with him.

They would give me updates on my son's life, and I would cry tears of joy and sadness when I heard about his accomplishments and milestones. I cried during my wedding and during my youngest son's birth because I missed my oldest son so much.\n\nRecently, I was invited to my ex-husband's parents' anniversary party. I decided to go, hoping to reconnect with my son. I didn't expect him to be happy to see me, but I was shocked by his reaction. He was angry that I had remarried and had a 5-year-old son. He felt like I had replaced him with a \"perfect, well-behaved kid.\" I tried to say that I had wanted to tell him, but I didn't know how to reach him. He yelled at me and then left with his dad and stepmom.\n\nI feel terrible about what happened. I was hoping to reconnect with my son, but instead, I made things worse.

Did you get blamed by your ex-husband and his affair partner?

Asking a kid to do homework, go to bed, etc just seems like normal mom territory. Was there absolutely no way you could have found a way to contact him? Letters, email, social media, anything? Did you make any sort of effort to find him or did you want to wait until he reached out first?\n\nI'm currently nagging my kids to go to bed, do their homework, etc. and this scenario is terrifying me. I feel like I would be the crazy person to hire a PI and get an address so I could drive to their new house and connect though. I don't think I would take no for an answer unless they made it clear that they wanted me to leave them alone.", "So let me get this straight he's the one that walks away, moves to a different state changes his number, and somehow it's your fault? NTA", "NTA, and I would send a message through saying that he doesn\u2019t get to pick and choose when his relationship with you. HE abandoned YOU for a new family that didn\u2019t parent him. HE changed his number, HE moved away. He chose his new family and you made yours. And honestly as much as you love them, what grandparent doesn\u2019t encourage their grandchild to talk to their mother that they have such a high regard of? I would question why they didn\u2019t even try to facilitate a meeting with all of you.", "NTA.  Your son's a brat.  No knowing what lies the father filled his head with.", "NTA.\nNot going to lie, I\u2019m surprised this is my judgment. \n\nBut after reading the story, and your comments about how your ex-husband treated your son as a pawn in the divorce, I suspect it\u2019s likely that this is parent alienation. \n\nAs an older teen, your son could have tried to keep in contact with you and did not. You DID try and keep in contact with him, but he stopped and then changed his number. Visitation was never mandated and you had no way to really reach him (besides letters I suppose).\n\nBut at that point, he was an adult. And many on this thread would say (in a different scenario) he had set a boundary and as a legal adult you shouldn\u2019t cross it.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry, but this grown ass adult cut you out of his life, went on to live a full one without acknowledging you in the slightest, and...what? Expected you to put yourself on a shelf to patiently await his consideration? Move on, your cheating ex has made damn sure to poison him against you, you wont reach him. Live your best life with the family that loves you. You got a second chance, that's nothing to feel guilty about. And chances are, his reaction was a result of his own deepseated guilt because he knows exactly what a shit he's been, and chose to lash out at you rather than accept his responsibility. Sound like anyone you divorced?", "NTA. Unless you are leaving something out, it sounds like you were a parent to your son (getting your kid to do their homework, eat healthy and sleep is basic parenting) and there might have been some parental alienation going on.\n\nWas your presence at the party a surprise? It seems odd that the inlaws would invite you without giving your ex a heads up.", "NTA. It sounds like you see things you could have done better. What parent can't relate to that. You didn't elaborate on your financial situation (and no need to), so we can only speculate what lengths you legally could have gone to. At this point, your son is an adult and has to navigate this journey between you and him on his own. It is unfortunate that you find yourself in this situation and I hope that one day your son can more clearly see that everything is not black and white.\n\nIn this situation, I would take a look back, with clear eyes, and allow myself to see the past as it was, for good and bad. Allow myself to learn from the mistakes I made and the mistakes of others. Maybe with help, start to wade through the lies and mistruths. Allow yourself to lift the weight of guilt off your shoulders by learning, growing and knowing.\n\nI wish you the best in your journey. While mine and your journey are different, I do see a bit of my past struggles in this.", "NTA. It seems like you tried but maybe your oldest just feels like you abandoned him", "This gives me the sense of missing missing reasons. People don't cut out family out of the blue. The reasons you've shared here aren't the real reasons. You need to look deeper. \n\nA party is not the place to have a reunion with an estranged (adult) child, especially to introduce them to your new family. Your expectations of your son's reaction are misaligned there. This was the first contact hes had with you for years, so yeah, it's going to be a shock. If you knew he was in contact with his grandparents, and you were in contact with them, there was a way to contact him through the grandparents. A letter could have passively informed him of your life events without the pressure of speaking to you in person or on the phone. I'm going with YTA. It sounds like there was a lot more going on here than you've shared, but I sense more effort could have been made as well.", "So he expects to dictate the terms.  You remain childless, no contact with him, no additional kids, while he gets everything he wants from his dad and your replacement?\n\nHe honestly sounds a bit entitled.  He wanted no contact or updates on your life and was ok with replacing you.  While you still wanted to be a mom. \n\nHe needs to learn that he can't always get what he wants.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA... This situation was created by him and ultimately,  his Dad.  He's projecting his anger at himself and Dad to you.  If he \"feels replaced,\" it's because he made himself replaceable (not suggesting this is remotely your intent BTW) and he believes this.  My theory is this... He's always been angry about Dad's infidelity and redirected the blame for Dad's sin to you.  Because you divorced Dad (ergo, broke up the family) because of DAD'S actions, it's your fault for everything that's wrong in his world, whatever that may be.  I guarantee he's harboring unresolved guilt surrounding the divorce given his \"feeling replaced by a perfect child\" or something like that.  I hope for all your sakes he figures this out, but for now, focus your energy on being the best Mom you can be.  That includes making sure he eats good food, giving him age-appropriate responsibilities, making unpopular decisions that's in his best interests, and everything else that GOOD parents do to prepare kids for life.", "ESH, you needed to more than call him when he decided to move out. \nYou should have asked your son how you could improve your relationship, you should have made every effort to explain to him why you did the things you did when he was young, recognise that they were wrong and probably go get some therapy together. \nIt does not sound like you did much of anything to try and actually improve your relationship with your son. \n\nOn the other hand, your son is an adult now who also chose not to try and cultivate any type of relationship with you and he doesn't get to yell at you for having a new family. He can be upset that you didn't try harder but to scream at you at a party is simply immature.", "Not an AH. However I'm not sure it was wise to attempt to reconnect with your son at this sort of event. If he wasn't expecting you to be there, maybe he couldn't prepare himself and process it well in the moment.", "Kids don't go NC for no reason. Until you are truthful about what actually happened Its ESH.", "It is a little weird that the grandparents did not mention the husband and the new kid to the son for 5 years.", "Info: what have you done to try to communicate with him before this and when was the last time you saw him?\n\nI feel like I would also be upset and shocked if I had no idea my parent had a family, and then showed up and surprised me. I feel like the dust will have to settle, but communication is a two-way street, and he could have also reached out too. I could also understand his initial reaction in this setting, if it was truly out of the blue. NAH", "ESH. You let your minor son become estranged from you. Once he was adult that's different and not on you, but this started when he was 16. Maybe his father was poisoning him against you, maybe there's something else relevant that you've chosen not to reveal to us. Maybe your son was just an AH. Impossible to say without more information that we will likely never be able to get.\n\nYour son does not get to go no contact with you, but still be upset that you didn't tell him about your new family. There really seems to be resentment about how you treated him as a child. I do not know if it is justified or not.\n\nYou should not have ambushed him like you did. Honestly, I don't understand what you expected to happen. I imagine you were emotional about possibly seeing him again, and I understand how badly you must have wanted that. Still blindsiding someone like that seems like a poorly thought-out idea at best.", "I find it unbelievable that your in-laws, your \u201crock\u201d, gave you updates on your son\u2019s life & refused to tell you where he was or how you could contact him. Did those updates not contain any information that would help you find him? As in they told you he was in college but they wouldn\u2019t say which one? They told you he got a job but they refused to say who the employer was or what city it was in? Since he was an adult who could have looked for you, too, ESH,  but you don\u2019t seem very truthful & your son doesn\u2019t believe you either.", "Oh sweetie. Those things you nagged him about were actually basic parenting. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong by your account. This is a really tough situation all around and I\u2019m going to say NAH. I\u2019m really sorry that your son continues to hold on to his anger.", "NAH, just an incredibly difficult situation for the both of you.", "NTA I think someone has been lying to your boy for years.  I think your in laws aren\u2019t the nice  people you think they are. I\u2019d pay for someone to find your son, make contact with him, share your side of the story as a third party and see if he\u2019d then be willing to meet with you. Good luck", "If he had been any younger when you and his father divorced i would say that you didnt do enough to keep a relationship with him. But pretty much any court is gonna take what a 16yo wants into account and also forcing relationships never helps them anyway. \n\ni think your ex and his wife actively helped turn him against you. While never listening to a child of any age sucks, the things you mentioned are actually just parenting. Like. Do your hw, eat well, go to bed on time, those are all the things a parent is obligated to make sure their child does. So i do think that while some mistakes were made, it doesnt sound like you were some raging unreasonable mother, they just saw an opportunity to hurt you and took it. \n\nWhat im really curious about is your ex inlaws. They were clearly seeing him to be able to give you updates, how and why did they never give him updates on you. Maybe he didnt wanna hear most of it sure but i think, 'hey your mums getting married', and 'hey your mums having another baby' are things you tell someone even if they dont wanna hear it. Especially if youre gonna be inviting everyone to the same parties. \n\nIt might just be something they overlooked but given how vindictive your ex seems to be id be looking at the whole situation with them with the most bombastic side eye possible atp. \n\nAlso, your sone is 28 now. i understand that childhood hurts and trauma turn into adult problems and most dont usually go away but come tf on. Hes an adult, he should be at a point that he can learn and understand the situation with all its ugly nuance. He doesnt have to like it, it can still hurt, he can still be angry or whatever else. But hes having a tantrum like hes the 5yo. He knows you had no way to contact him so how did he expect you to tell him?? He should be looking at his grandparents funny too if anything. \n\nThis situation sucks and im sorry but you are NTA", "Mild YTA.  Your pain is understandable, and your regrets over your roll in the problems in the relationship are to be commended. Of course you want to reconnect with him.\n\nHowever:\n\n1. Events like the anniversary party are a poor place to attempt to reconnect with people who one is on strained terms with.\n2. Surprising the person you want to reconnect with is also likely to go sideways.

Maybe even talk to the grandparents since you have a good relationship with them. Ask them if they know of what went wrong in your relationship. NOT so you can go and talk to him about it.

Throughout all of this her son doesn't have a single bad thing to say about his father, even though he married the stepmom and enabled her behavior as far as I can tell.\n\nIt definitely sounds like he's scapegoating her and that the ex-husband has helped that along from the sidelines. The son definitely needs therapy, since it sounds like he never got it, and needs to leave OP alone for moving on with her life. What was she supposed to do? Wallow forever and never move on from how she was when he was sixteen? This might be uncharitable, but it feels like part of the reason he's mad is because she's not as miserable as he thinks she should be.", "Maybe the son wants to keep punishing and hurting his mother by denying her contact? By that, I mean that he may have felt like he had an upper hand in this game of his, but now the mom is remarried and even has a child. He really doesn't want to let go of that power over her. \n\nOf course, the only sensible thing to do in that case is to try to hurt the mother by accusing her of replacing him, which is total nonsense, because the son himself tossed away his relationship a decent amount of years before the half-sibling got conceived. \n\nIn son's head, the ideal world would be one where the mother tries time and time again to reconnect, blames herself, suffers, and doesn't move on with her life from the point where divorce happened, feeding his sense of self-importance. \n\nI bet the in-laws, who invited OP to the party were either pleased with how their grandson tried to humiliate OP, or even expected it to happen. It feels almost like a setup, a chance to drag her down a notch.", "This. The older son definitely needs therapy but whether or not he gets it, or even sees whats happening as a situation worth the effort, is entirely up to him. \n\nI do feel bad for OP but at this point I think she should lower her expectations for full reconciliation. She's certainly entitled to those feelings, especially as it seems those feelings kept her going for awhile. However you can't force the older son to meet you half way. He's an adult now and should be mature enough to know what he does and doesn't want from his life. Unfortunately OP seems to be firmly in the second category.", "Yes, I'm a bit confused about the total lack of updates about OP's life to son when OP is so close to the former in-laws. Okay, his new number is not theirs to give (I do find it odd that OP gave up so easily after they didn't give her the number though).\n\nHowever, when she was getting married and pregnant, one would think that she would try to get that info across to her son. Also, I would expect the grandparents to be willing to give those updates to her son since those are major life events. If they were so adamant on respecting the grandson's no contact, why did they invite OP to their party?", "This is the reply I was looking for. She even says their relationship was \"strained\" even before the divorce because of \"nagging\". I don't buy that that's the whole story.\n\nI nag my teen about homework and cleaning her room but we don't have a strained relationship. On the contrary, we're quite close. This whole thing seems fishy to me.", "100%. But AITA eats it up because of how OP phrases it and potrays herself as the angelic innocent mother who did no wrong. Sure OP might be the absolute innocent angel in this. But you're right.

I feel what is here is pretty much textbook dad paints himself out to be the fun parent, kid decides to live with said fun parent, then unsurprisingly stays emotionally immature as he's never been made to grow up. Much like a small child, now-adult son is somehow surprised to find out his mom kept living her life and didn't just cry in the corner for nearly a decade.\n\nTo me it sounds like her son was just made aware that she'd remarried and had a kid, not that they were at the party. If he couldn't handle that, it's on him. Nothing OP said suggested to me she actually brought them with her and tried to have an impromptu family reunion with her son.", "Yes it was.

Your son is hurt, lacking a bond with your mother is painful whether or not you chose that. He almost certainly feels like you pushed him away, and subtly over the years (or maybe even overtly) he has almost certainly been convinced that you're the problem. He probably thinks you're the reason his father cheated, therefore that it was justified... and he has evidence, you said so yourself that you weren't exactly fun to be around.\n\nIn the absence of communication we fill in the blanks. My mother didn't have custody of me. My entire life I have had a general sense that my mother should have tried harder to be a part of my life. When I became a teenager and an adult she stopped calling as much. Years later she told me it's because she didn't want to seem suffocating and basically thought that's what I wanted. In reality that was another straw that broke. Even to this day my mother does not call me often. I know it's not malicious, I know she loves me. But I do still feel in some small way that as my mother *she* should want to talk to *me*. She should make that effort because I'm her kid, and don't parents love their kids and want to talk to them?\n\nNow to address the elephant in the room. He stopped contacting you, not the other way around. You know how sometimes girls test their boyfriends? I wonder if this is that. If he wanted to test if you would actually try to be a part of his life if he stopped putting in effort. Do you love him enough to jump through the hoops he puts up? There was a brief period in time where I stopped calling my mother just to see if she would pick up the slack. She didn't, and that's what led to the conversation where she finally told me she thought that's what I wanted.\n\nCan you find one of his social media accounts? Is there any way you can directly get in contact with this kid? If you want a relationship with your son, whether or not it's right, I think you should go out of your way to be the bigger person right now. I think you should reach out directly, but if you cannot you should tell someone to please communicate to him that you would like to speak with him. If he is not receptive, write a letter and pass it along to someone.\n\nYou need to spell out in very clear explicit language your regrets about his childhood, all of the mixed emotions that led to you thinking stopping communication was for the better, and apologize for not making a bigger effort. Make sure he knows you asked his grandparents for his number when he changed it, but, I have to be honest, if his grandparents wouldn't give me his phone number I would have hunted his ass down on Facebook or just a background search website. I do think he almost certainly feels like you could have tried harder with that in particular. Do not blame your ex at all, do not blame his grandparents. Make sure you express to him that you have been his cheerleader every step of the way through his grandparents. Tell him the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago and the second best time is today. Tell him you want to make an effort to be a part of his life and that if he's willing you'd like to set up a zoom call.\n\nI don't want to be a jerk, but from reading your post I just really got the sense that you gave up too easily. Like you kind of told yourself he didn't want you in his life and so to you every sign pointed to him wanting you gone, so you just left.\n\nThis isn't a silver bullet. You may never heal the relationship with your son, but even if he doesn't reach out anytime soon, If you tell him all of that, I think one day he will forgive you.", "Yes, that probably is what the son wanted OP to do. She was supposed to regret how much he felt she had criticized him growing up, and suffer with his absence. She is, but she\u2019s also made a new life for herself too, and that stings.
