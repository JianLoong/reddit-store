Meanwhile the cheating father and mistress-turned-stepmom are the heroes?? Are you sure that your in-laws are as great as you think?", "Sounds like he's scapegoating you for the divorce. Did you get blamed by your ex-husband and his affair partner? I would have felt so betrayed that my son would pick the cheating father and his affair partner over his mom.\n\nNTA He cut you out of his life, he doesn't get to act like he didn't reject you.", "Info: Have you ever asked his grandparents to help keep communication open?

Asking a kid to do homework, go to bed, etc just seems like normal mom territory. Was there absolutely no way you could have found a way to contact him? Letters, email, social media, anything? Did you make any sort of effort to find him or did you want to wait until he reached out first?\n\nI'm currently nagging my kids to go to bed, do their homework, etc. and this scenario is terrifying me. I feel like I would be the crazy person to hire a PI and get an address so I could drive to their new house and connect though. I don't think I would take no for an answer unless they made it clear that they wanted me to leave them alone.", "So let me get this straight he's the one that walks away, moves to a different state changes his number, and somehow it's your fault? NTA", "NTA, and I would send a message through saying that he doesn\u2019t get to pick and choose when his relationship with you. HE abandoned YOU for a new family that didn\u2019t parent him. HE changed his number, HE moved away. He chose his new family and you made yours. And honestly as much as you love them, what grandparent doesn\u2019t encourage their grandchild to talk to their mother that they have such a high regard of? I would question why they didn\u2019t even try to facilitate a meeting with all of you.", "NTA.  Your son's a brat.  No knowing what lies the father filled his head with.", "NTA.\nNot going to lie, I\u2019m surprised this is my judgment. \n\nBut after reading the story, and your comments about how your ex-husband treated your son as a pawn in the divorce, I suspect it\u2019s likely that this is parent alienation. \n\nAs an older teen, your son could have tried to keep in contact with you and did not. You DID try and keep in contact with him, but he stopped a Diane then changed his number. Visitation was never mandated and you had no way to really reach him (besides letters I suppose).\n\nBut at that point, he was an adult. And many on this thread would say (in a different scenario) he had set a boundary and as a legal adult you shouldn\u2019t cross it.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry, but this grown ass adult cut you out of his life, went on to live a full one without acknowledging you in the slightest, and...what? Expected you to put yourself on a shelf to patiently await his consideration? Move on, your cheating ex has made damn sure to poison him against you, you wont reach him. Live your best life with the family that loves you. You got a second chance, that's nothing to feel guilty about. And chances are, his reaction was a result of his own deepseated guilt because he knows exactly what a shit he's been, and chose to lash out at you rather than accept his responsibility. Sound like anyone you divorced?", "NTA. Unless you are leaving something out, it sounds like you were a parent to your son (getting your kid to do their homework, eat healthy and sleep is basic parenting) and there might have been some parental alienation going on.\n\nWas your presence at the party a surprise? It seems odd that the inlaws would invite you without giving your ex a heads up.", "NTA. It sounds like you see things you could have done better. What parent can't relate to that. You didn't elaborate on your financial situation (and no need to), so we can only speculate what lengths you legally could have gone to. At this point, your son is an adult and has to navigate this journey between you and him on his own. It is unfortunate that you find yourself in this situation and I hope that one day your son can more clearly see that everything is not black and white.\n\nIn this situation, I would take a look back, with clear eyes, and allow myself to see the past as it was, for good and bad. Allow myself to learn from the mistakes I made and the mistakes of others. Maybe with help, start to wade through the lies and mistruths. Allow yourself to lift the weight of guilt off your shoulders by learning, growing and knowing.\n\nI wish you the best in your journey. While mine and your journey are different, I do see a bit of my past struggles in this.", "NTA. It seems like you tried but maybe your oldest just feels like you abandoned him", "This gives me the sense of missing missing reasons. People don't cut out family out of the blue. The reasons you've shared here aren't the real reasons. You need to look deeper. \n\nA party is not the place to have a reunion with an estranged (adult) child, especially to introduce them to your new family. Your expectations of your son's reaction are misaligned there. This was the first contact hes had with you for years, so yeah, it's going to be a shock. If you knew he was in contact with his grandparents, and you were in contact with them, there was a way to contact him through the grandparents. A letter could have passively informed him of your life events without the pressure of speaking to you in person or on the phone. I'm going with YTA. It sounds like there was a lot more going on here than you've shared, but I sense more effort could have been made as well.", "So he expects to dictate the terms.  You remain childless, no contact with him, no additional kids, while he gets everything he wants from his dad and your replacement?\n\nHe honestly sounds a bit entitled.  He wanted no contact or updates on your life and was ok with replacing you.  While you still wanted to be a mom. \n\nHe needs to learn that he can't always get what he wants.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA... This situation was created by him and ultimately,  his Dad.  He's projecting his anger at himself and Dad to you.  If he \"feels replaced,\" it's because he made himself replaceable (not suggesting this is remotely your intent BTW) and he believes this.  My theory is this... He's always been angry about Dad's infidelity and redirected the blame for Dad's sin to you.  Because you divorced Dad (ergo, broke up the family) because of DAD'S actions, it's your fault for everything that's wrong in his world, whatever that may be.  I guarantee he's harboring unresolved guilt surrounding the divorce given his \"feeling replaced by a perfect child\" or something like that.  I hope for all your sakes he figures this out, but for now, focus your energy on being the best Mom you can be.  That includes making sure he eats good food, giving him age-appropriate responsibilities, making unpopular decisions that's in his best interests, and everything else that GOOD parents do to prepare kids for life.", "ESH, you needed to more than call him when he decided to move out. \nYou should have asked your son how you could improve your relationship, you should have made every effort to explain to him why you did the things you did when he was young, recognise that they were wrong and probably go get some therapy together. \nIt does not sound like you did much of anything to try and actually improve your relationship with your son. \n\nOn the other hand, your son is an adult now who also chose not to try and cultivate any type of relationship with you and he doesn't get to yell at you for having a new family. He can be upset that you didn't try harder but to scream at you at a party is simply immature.", "Not an AH. However I'm not sure it was wise to attempt to reconnect with your son at this sort of event. If he wasn't expecting you to be there, maybe he couldn't prepare himself and process it well in the moment.", "Kids don't go NC for no reason. Until you are truthful about what actually happened Its ESH.", "It is a little weird that the grandparents did not mention the husband and the new kid to the son for 5 years.", "Info: what have you done to try to communicate with him before this and when was the last time you saw him?\n\nI feel like I would also be upset and shocked if I had no idea my parent had a family, and then showed up and surprised me. I feel like the dust will have to settle, but communication is a two-way street, and he could have also reached out too. I could also understand his initial reaction in this setting, if it was truly out of the blue. NAH", "ESH. You let your minor son become estranged from you. Once he was adult that's different and not on you, but this started when he was 16. Maybe his father was poisoning him against you, maybe there's something else relevant that you've chosen not to reveal to us. Maybe your son was just an AH. Impossible to say without more information that we will likely never be able to get.\n\nYour son does not get to go no contact with you, but still be upset that you didn't tell him about your new family. There really seems to be resentment about how you treated him as a child. I do not know if it is justified or not.\n\nYou should not have ambushed him like you did. Honestly, I don't understand what you expected to happen. I imagine you were emotional about possibly seeing him again, and I understand how badly you must have wanted that. Still blindsiding someone like that seems like a poorly thought-out idea at best.", "I find it unbelievable that your in-laws, your \u201crock\u201d, gave you updates on your son\u2019s life & refused to tell you where he was or how you could contact him. Did those updates not contain any information that would help you find him? As in they told you he was in college but they wouldn\u2019t say which one? They told you he got a job but they refused to say who the employer was or what city it was in? Since he was an adult who could have looked for you, too, ESH,  but you don\u2019t seem very truthful & your son doesn\u2019t believe you either.", "Oh sweetie. Those things you nagged him about were actually basic parenting. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong by your account. This is a really tough situation all around and I\u2019m going to say NAH. I\u2019m really sorry that your son continues to hold on to his anger.", "NAH, just an incredibly difficult situation for the both of you.", "NTA I think someone has been lying to your boy for years.  I think your in laws aren\u2019t the nice  people you think they are. I\u2019d pay for someone to find your son, make contact with him, share your side of the story as a third party and see if he\u2019d then be willing to meet with you. Good luck", "If he had been any younger when you and his father divorced i would say that you didnt do enough to keep a relationship with him. But pretty much any court is gonna take what a 16yo wants into account and also forcing relationships never helps them anyway. \n\ni think your ex and his wife actively helped turn him against you. While never listening to a child of any age sucks, the things you mentioned are actually just parenting. Like. Do your hw, eat well, go to bed on time, those are all the things a parent is obligated to make sure their child does. So i do think that while some mistakes were made, it doesnt sound like you were some raging unreasonable mother, they just saw an opportunity to hurt you and took it. \n\nWhat im really curious about is your ex inlaws. They were clearly seeing him to be able to give you updates, how and why did they never give him updates on you. Maybe he didnt wanna hear most of it sure but i think, 'hey your mums getting married', and 'hey your mums having another baby' are things you tell someone even if they dont wanna hear it. Especially if youre gonna be inviting everyone to the same parties. \n\nIt might just be something they overlooked but given how vindictive your ex seems to be id be looking at the whole situation with them with the most bombastic side eye possible atp. \n\nAlso, your sone is 28 now. i understand that childhood hurts and trauma turn into adult problems and most dont usually go away but come tf on. Hes an adult, he should be at a point that he can learn and understand the situation with all its ugly nuance. He doesnt have to like it, it can still hurt, he can still be angry or whatever else. But hes having a tantrum like hes the 5yo. He knows you had no way to contact him so how did he expect you to tell him?? He should be looking at his grandparents funny too if anything. \n\nThis situation sucks and im sorry but you are NTA", "Mild YTA.  Your pain is understandable, and your regrets over your roll in the problems in the relationship are to be commended. Of course you want to reconnect with him.\n\nHowever:\n\n1. Events like the anniversary party are a poor place to attempt to reconnect with people who one is on strained terms with.\n2. Surprising the person you want to reconnect with is also likely to go sideways. People who have estranged themselves from their parents refer to this as \"ambushing\".\n\nIt might be better to reach out through a third party such as your ex-in-laws and to take baby steps towards reconciliation at pace that he is comfortable with.  \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. He chose to cut contact, as was his right. He has zero rights now to act hurt that he doesn't know what is happening in the life of the person he cut off.

Maybe there\u2019s more to the story we\u2019re not being giving as to why he moved and didn\u2019t keep in touch, but it was his choice to go NC.  Having family stomp on those boundaries by giving out contact info is horrible.", "It was their way of helping me moving on.", "At that age I\u2019m assuming they just let the kid choose where he wants to go since he was 16? Otherwise I typically wouldn\u2019t expect the person who had an affair to get full custody.", "[deleted]", "Yeahhh I imagine she would have a hard time elaborating since she admits to never listening to him. It\u2019s kind of a tale as old as time to dismiss your kid and then be \ud83d\ude31 shocked when they dismiss you as soon as they\u2019re able. \n\nI agree with those saying the in laws aren\u2019t as great as they seem, since they knew their grandson wasn\u2019t aware of the new family and orchestrated an event where he\u2019d be finding out on the spot. He should\u2019ve been prepared ahead of time for something that big and you would think that considerate, caring grandparents would either sit him down to tell him or not invite the ex daughter in law considering the circumstances. ESH except for the kid, who likely needs to go process in therapy. I don\u2019t fault him for reacting in the moment, even at his age", "Personally what I would have done done is left a simple short letter with the grandparents. It would of been up to him to read it or not that way.", "They wanted you to move on from your child?", "If you are fine with them deciding that you should move on & fine with them keeping your son\u2019s contact information away from you, then I\u2019m not surprised your son believes you were fine with moving on to a new family & replacing him.", "I am sorry if i didn't explained my self properly.\n\nIn the beggining, he would pick up my phone calls but then he stopped.\n\nI continued to try and call him but then i learned he changed his phone number, he was 19 i think.", "That's because he wouldn't pick up her calls and the ex did nothing to force him to keep in contact with his mom, to the point where he eventually changed his number. What is she supposed to do then???", "Life is not literal, Giraffeperv. Nothing from OP's post suggests she did anything short of her best. She acknowledges her shortcomings which is amazing. I stand by what I said OP, stay strong.", "I had a really bad childhood, and I am very sensitive to child abuse and neglect. I don\u2019t get the sense of this at all.\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That would work too.", "How far away did he move? I\u2019m confused why that\u2019s all the effort that was made. 3 years passed and you didn\u2019t even bother to visit him? Or did you conveniently leave that out too?", "Yes because her child reacted that badly at seeing her because she did her best? You really don\u2019t think he seems raw about it? At 28? 12 years after the divorce?", ">How far away did he move?\n\nFrom Florida to North Carolina.\n\n>I\u2019m confused why that\u2019s all the effort that was made. 3 years passed and you didn\u2019t even bother to visit him? Or did you conveniently leave that out too?\n\nI tried to spend time with him but everytime i tried he would either bail out or not wanting to come.\n\nI only saw him in important days.", "He didn't want to be contacted clearly, would you have preferred op harassed him?", "Yes. \n\nParents are human. \nMothers especially so. \n\nI don't see the point of beating OP down further when nothing suggests that she did anything short of her best.", "Tbh from your post it makes it sound like you straight up didn\u2019t try to even talk to him for three years & then were like \u201cwhy is he upset with me?\u201d I think an edit could come in handy here", "You could just read where OP & I discussed it :) She did attend important events & I suggested she add that to her post", "I guess we just disagree, because when I read this post I see a mother who didn\u2019t try enough :/", "Thank you i will do it", "Yes let's agree to disagree \ud83e\udd17"]}
