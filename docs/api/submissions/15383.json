But then Dan will complain to me because Kayla said I was shaming her for her \u201cADHD symptoms\u201d and \u201cmaking her feel pathetic for having mental illness.\u201d Uh, no, I asked why she never goes to the class that she (cough, her parents) pay for.\n\nThen, there was another incident when I confronted her because she racks up dishes and never, ever cleans them.

I wasn't there for the convo so idk how you asked, but I think I can offer some insight to the mentally ill side. Those types of questions often come off as judgy and patronizing. We internalize it and hear \"why can't you just be better?\" \nWe're already thinking about where we're failing,  and we can't escape that EVER. I have also kicked out a mentally ill roommate bc of her behavior. It sucked and I felt guilty for years, but that in itself wasn't wrong of me.
