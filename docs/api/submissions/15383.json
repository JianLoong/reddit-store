Dan and I have been friends since high school, but we only got close upon becoming roommates in college. Dan has girlfriend of two years, Kayla (19F). Kayla practically lives at our apartment, though she is supposed to be living with her parents and commuting to our college. She lived in an off-campus apartment with a few other girls until earlier this semester, but was apparently ostracized there because it was a \u201ctoxic\u201d group. \n\nKayla racks up dishes in our kitchen, has her makeup and various girl shit scattered about our bathroom, and will just stay on our couch taking bong rips all day while Dan is in class. Kayla is an art therapy major; her coursework isn\u2019t hard. I\u2019ve asked Kayla why she doesn\u2019t go to class, and she\u2019ll give me some snarky comment about how that\u2019s none of my business or whatever. Fair enough. But then Dan will complain to me because Kayla said I was shaming her for her \u201cADHD symptoms\u201d and \u201cmaking her feel pathetic for having mental illness.\u201d Uh, no, I asked why she never goes to the class that she (cough, her parents) pay for.\n\nThen, there was another incident when I confronted her because she racks up dishes and never, ever cleans them. I came home from spring break and the sink had grown into this moldy, disgusting biohazard, and our living area had become strewn with Kayla\u2019s clothes and reeked of unscooped cat litter (they share a cat). I confronted Kayla, asking her to clean up her mess, and she broke down into a blubbering mess because cleaning \u201creminds her of her abusive parents shaming her for being dirty\u201d so she doesn\u2019t. Also, her ADHD.\n\nMy final straw was yesterday, when I brought up next year\u2019s housing to Dan. He insisted we get a 3-person lease so that Kayla could live with us. I told him no, I don\u2019t want to live with Kayla, why the hell would we do that. He said that, due to Kayla\u2019s mental illness, a) she has severe attachment issues so doesn\u2019t feel comfortable in their relationship when Dan isn\u2019t by her side 24/7 and b) Kayla refuses to keep commuting because her \u201cmental illness prevents her from getting to class with a commute\u201d but has no roommates to board with. I\u2019m done. I started shouting at Dan that his girlfriend needs to start acting like a ffing adult and stop claiming mental illness to avoid every single inconvenience in her life.\n\nKayla is appalled and is trying to cancel me, thinking that I\u2019m heartless and hate the mentally ill.
