It\u2019s probably more like a dorm or crappy apartment she\u2019s used to anyway (except she has the bonus of it being free I assume).

The only reason the oldest gets the room is because they were first in line for it.  When you move out, you forfeit your room & are no longer first in line.  If the oldest always has the right to their room back no matter how long they\u2019ve been gone or why they move back, that implies that they aren\u2019t just getting their own room because they were first in line but because they are superior in some way which is rubbish.  You move out, you lose your right to your own room.  It isn\u2019t yours for all time to come back & claim whenever you may need it in future.  That\u2019s just not how the world works.

Additionally, your parents didn\u2019t LEND you your own rooms, they GAVE each of you your own room.  \n\nI can certainly understand where your parents are coming from, but your older sister should not get to displace either of you.  You\u2019re almost 18.  When you move out for college, then she can get her own room.  Even if you choose another path & don\u2019t move out until later, she can wait her turn like you did.  \n\nI\u2019m the oldest in my family, but I wouldn\u2019t expect my family to take away someone\u2019s room so I could move back home.

The only reason the oldest gets the room is because they were first in line for it.  When you move out, you forfeit your room & are no longer first in line.  If the oldest always has the right to their room back no matter how long they\u2019ve been gone or why they move back, that implies that they aren\u2019t just getting their own room because they were first in line but because they are superior in some way which is rubbish.  You move out, you lose your right to your own room.  It isn\u2019t yours for all time to come back & claim whenever you may need it in future.  That\u2019s just not how the world works.  And I\u2019m the oldest child in my family telling you that.\n\nEDIT FOR EVERYONE COMING FOR ME - there was NO leukemia comment when I posted the above. If you will look at the time I posted my comment & the time her leukemia comment was posted, you will easily see that there was no such comment when I posted the above.

I very much understand why you want your own space, it makes absolute sense, but she is pretty much now actively fighting cancer. The treatments are no joke, they make you feel absolutely horrible, with like having to throw up in the middle of the night, not getting proper sleep and generally just feeling sick. While your position isn't unreasonable, the strain cancer and it's treatments put on you are no joke. I implore you to consider her situation a bit more here. A proper place o rest is really important", "This is appalling! \n\nI\u2019m not saying people who are unwell automatically get dibs but it seems like you have no clue how treatment will take its toll on her in the days to come. If she undergoes chemo as part of her treatment, she also needs the ability to isolate from others because of her compromised immune system. \n\nShe\u2019s not their undisputed favorite. She\u2019s really quite sick and your parents are rightfully scared and worried, and you want her to sleep on a sofa during treatment.  \n\nThis is the wake up call to reflect and figure out where your empathy and grace went.", "Wow you are an asshole. You left out this out because you know you\u2019re being an asshole", "Way to bury the lede my guy. Obviously YTA", "You are a monster. YTA", "Yta.  She needs her own room. Suck it up and bunk with bella or you take the office.   Selfish much?", "Nah didn't know it was cancer when I posted. Just got \"sick\" as an answer and should have clarified more. Now changed thanks for the update! Was also thinking more just OP and parents not including the sister in that.", "Just fyi wombatcombat95 posted their comment before OP posted that the sister has leukemia.", "OP is a massive AH", "Maybe this is a small place to recibe treatment for leukemia (her sister sickness)", "Ya, I saw that.  I just don't think that's completely truthful.  If you can have a sleeper couch, you can have a bed.  Ya, might be a single or full, but a bed would fit.  That being said, I see the parents work in there, so that is likely a better reason.", "A fact she conveniently didn't put in her original post.  I am changing it to be YTA.", "A fact she conveniently didn't put in her original post.  I am changing it to be YTA.", "SHE DIDN'T PUT THAT IN HER ORIGINAL POST!\n\nWe are not fucking telepathic.", "A fact she conveniently didn't put in her original post.  I am changing it to be YTA.", "A fact she conveniently didn't put in her original post. I have changed it to be YTA.", "A fact she conveniently didn't put in her original post. I have changed it to be YTA.", "A fact she conveniently didn't put in her original post. I have changed it to be YTA.", "ESPECIALLY when the child they invited back has cancer.", "Oh I agree. Just saying OP\u2019s post is misleading and trying to paint the older sister negatively when she actually left because she has leukemia.", "It matters, she is sick with cancer", "Because she has cancer.", "Precisely. You don't keep tally of how many times you've done someone a favour vs them for you.\n\nAnd what about the younger step sis in this situation? I doubt she wants to share a room and is only a year younger.\n\n\"I can clearly see who the favorite is and that they don't care about me\". Good ol' emotional blackmail. Of course most are NTA votes", "It\u2019s cancer.", "I never said she was. I was insinuating that OP was implying / suggesting that her sister was a moocher because she's not expected to pay for anything upon returning home, which is awful given the reason why she left college. Jesus Christ why is it so difficult for so many here to grasp reading comprehension.", "Thank you. I appreciate you saying so.", "OP also doesn't seem to believe it's that bad.\n\n\"*She says* she's too tired to study or work.\" You can pretty much see the air quotes.\n\nUm, yeah. If OP knew anything about cancer, she'd understand why.", "Ok? They can't be apprised of the situation afterward? I wasn't rude, I asked a question.", "I just believe that if the office were a viable option (for example if a normal bed and basic furniture would fit perfectly) OP would have mention it because it would be the perfect solution.", "Yeah, do AH genuinely not realize omitting such important information just makes them even bigger AHs or do they just not care?", "No you\u2019re not! I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m irritated with her petulance and pity grabbing while hiding details. I didn\u2019t mean it towards you but towards her.", "Yikes, that\u2019s terrible!", "If that's true, OP isn't just an asshole, she's evil.", "Fair enough.  But it doesn't seem to be a size issue, and just the parents needing the space for work.  That being said, I maintain that this is just a hard situation for everyone involved and I understand how it is frustrating.", "That's ok.  OP has annoyed me too by purposely omitting that key piece of information.", "Yup, pure evil.", "I did say you could put a narrower bed in there. My parents don't want to do that because they don't want Amy to sleep in the office (turned bedroom).", "I wouldn't say \"pure\", but it's selfish and narcissistic as all holy hell.", "Is your sister sick? Why did she dropped collage?", "Just a suggestion, but I had an old friend that had to share a room with his brother.  They ended up putting a divider in the room to make it two spaces.  You can do this with something like bookshelves, a curtain or even a temporary wall with some 2x4s and paneling.", "That\u2019s your solution - if you want your own room, your (very ill) sister can have your bedroom and you can take the tiny room. That way she has the space she needs to recover, and you can still have your own room.", "She has cancer"]}
