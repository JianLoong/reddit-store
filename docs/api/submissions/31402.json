Rose is prone to ear infections. \n\nShe had a double ear infection recently and couldn\u2019t go to school on Friday because she had a low grade fever. I had to go to work and couldn\u2019t get a babysitter so my SIL offered to keep her for me. \n\nEverything seemed to go well until I picked Rose up and my SIL told me she had put breastmilk (she has a 12 week old) in Rose\u2019s ears to help with the ear infection. She even offered to send some home in a dropper bottle so I can keep giving it to her. She claims it\u2019s a great remedy and that Rose was already starting to feel better. I couldn\u2019t believe that she did this to my child without asking. I yelled at her for it, we argued, and I told her she will no longer be able to babysit/be around Rose unsupervised. Now Rose is upset that she can\u2019t go to her auntie\u2019s house anymore and my brother called me to say that I upset his wife, she was just trying to help, and that I overreacted. This is a woman putting her bodily fluids in my child\u2019s ear. I think I have a right to be upset. It seems that everyone is against me on this so I wanted to know if I was the asshole for banning her from babysitting or being near Rose unsupervised.", "created_utc": 1700547842, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180ahbm/aita_for_banning_my_sil_from_babysitting_after/", "score": 8754, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even acknowledging that breast milk contains antibodies and is designed for consumption, it also contains white blood cells from the mother, and there's no promise that blood products from SIL are safe for Rose, especially since it was applied topically and not eaten.\n\nMy biggest problem with this, even factoring in that SIL is a nurse, is the fact of boundaries. SIL was not looking after her niece as a nurse, but as a babysitter, and should have acted as one, including talking to OP about the idea before going through with it. As someone who was tasked with keeping track of emergency medication in a school, I couldn't give so much as a painkiller without reaching out to parents unless it was life or death.\n\nEdit: clearing redundancy.", "Jfc reddit is wild. Any other post where a family member babysitter gives a kid *baby Tylenol* without permission and those people are AHs, but according to Reddit you overreacted because it\u2019s breast milk this time.\n\nNTA. Babysitters shouldn\u2019t be giving *any* medicine or home remedies without permission. No matter how normal and fine people apparently think it is.", "NTA. She did it without asking, that's the issue here.", "NTA, I see the comments calling out that the breast milk is fine and all that but that's NOT the issue, it's about someone ELSE'S breast milk, who knows if they have any health issues/sickness to make it worse?!  Also it was a decision about your child that she didn't have the right to make, providing medical help in any way requires parental consent.", "These comments are fucking insane. \n\n1. I looked it up, and for every article claiming that putting breast milk directly into the ear helps an infection, there were at least two more (far more trustworthy) sites saying that it can cause an infection, and it's drinking breast milk that can help. Don't trust the first article you see just because it's the top google result. Search results \"snippets\" are often filled with out of context, misleading, or incorrect info.\n\n\n\n2. I don't give a shit if the SIL is a pediatric nurse. Yes, people shouldn't assume they know better than someone with a degree, but plenty of people with degrees make costly mistakes, and that's *with* the consent of the patient or their guardian. And if SIL did this at her job, even with an\n informed and consenting family, she'd be fired. It doesn't suddenly become okay to do this without consent because she's a relative.\n\n\n\n3. Yes, breast milk is in fact a bodily fluid. Just because it can be safely ingested far more than others doesn't make it not risky. Reddit always (rightfully) condemns people who breast feed other people's children without the parent's consent, it doesn't suddenly become okay because she put it in the child's ear. Which again, might not be some magic cure all like you guys seem to think, and has a good chance of making the problem worse.\n\nI feel like I'm going insane. Don't put your bodily fluids into other people's children without asking. Even if the one or two sites that say putting breast milk directly into the ear is helpful are somehow correct and the more numerous sites claiming the opposite are wrong, it's not up to the SIL. NTA", "NTA someone put their bodily fluids in your child's ears. All sorts of diseases can be transferred via milk, which is why hospitals screen donors. Irrespective of breast milks purported benefits it was done without your permission nor any form of testing. It blows my mind that anyone would call you an asshole for this.", "NTA.\n\nBreastmilk has limited antimicrobial properties in the gastrointestinal tract, and very limited antiviral properties in the mouth (essentially if your baby is exposed to a virus within 10 minutes of drinking it, the milk might make a small difference), and has moisturising properties for skin.\n\nOther than that, it\u2019s fat and sugar. Aka food for bacterial growth. Putting it in ears, eyes, etc is best case useless, worst case actively harmful.\n\nIt is also a substance that carries within it substances imbibed by the person producing it, and blood borne diseases.\n\nGiving any medication, or natural remedy to a child without parental knowledge and consent is a huge problem.\n\nYour SIL is an AH and it\u2019s deeply concerning that a paediatric nurse can\u2019t discern high quality medical research from lactivist bollocks.", "NTA. I won\u2019t jump into the debate about breastmilk being helpful or not, but I say NTA because any medical treatment should have been run by you. Sure, if there were an emergency needing drastic and quick treatment, but the ear infection is not.", "You are NTA! This isn\u2019t about whether or not breast milk is beneficial to ear infections. This is about you SIL deciding to treat your daughters illness without your permission. Since your daughter is too young to understand and consent, it is your role as her parent to protect her and make the best medical choices for her - no non-parental figure has the right to make that call. \n\nAs for moving forward - once the anger cools down a bit, meet up with SIL for coffee. Explain that you know she has your kids best interests at heart, but you are not comfortable with her making medical decisions for your daughter. If she can agree to that, I think it\u2019s okay to let her back into your daughters life. If she breaks that agreement later down the line - well, she knows the consequences. \n\nIf SIL pushes back against your boundaries, one useful tactic is saying: I don\u2019t need you to understand, but I do need you to accept. I\u2019ve used this before w people in my life who simply do not understand a choice I\u2019ve made, and it does work. \n\nYou sound like a really good mom \ud83d\udc9c don\u2019t let anyone make you doubt that", "I keep seeing posts saying that this is a widespread remedy to treat ear infections, but I cannot find any scientific articles or any medical documentation saying that breast milk has been clinically proven to treat ear infections. I have found websites that claim this as a remedy, but there is absolutely no medical information on these websites. On the contrary, I have found reputable medical websites saying that milk in the ear (including breast milk) will make the ear infections worse. I understand that BREASTFEED INFANTS have a decreased chance of ear infections, but milk has sugars in it so putting it into the ears is just giving the bacteria more fuel. \n\nOP CALL YOUR CHILD\u2019s DOCTOR AND ASK THEM!!!!

That\u2019s such an invasive thing to do, I would expect someone to ask me before they treat my child especially with something like breast milk. You probably don\u2019t need to ban your daughter from seeing your SIL - she\u2019s had to have gotten the message to not overstep, so I would give her another chance but if she blows that, bye", "NTA - I really hate the \u201cwas only trying to help\u201d excuse when someone has the audacity to do something without a persons permission.", "NTA.

Yes it is breast milk and yes it might be beneficial to assist your child but she should have asked and see if you were comfortable with it. Even if it is natural for her, it could be seen kind like the same if you would want her to be wet nurse to your child...she should ask.", "NTA\n\nShe should have asked before giving any treatment. Her credentials are largely irrelevant.", "NTA for being upset. I kinda would be too.

She introduced her own bodily fluids into an area of your daughters body that is already in the grips of infection. She could have made everything so much worse and caused irreparable damage to your daughters hearing.\n\nYou are *right* to keep your daughter away from someone who behaves like that. She doesn't understand what she did wrong, she doesn't respect your parental authority, and she doesn't have any remorse for her actions. All of those things mean she will endanger your daughter again if she thinks she is doing the right thing.\n\nJust because her intentions weren't malicious, doesn't mean that she didn't destroy any and all trust you can ever have in her.

There are issues with consent, and SiL did not respect that boundary.

She could be dosing her patients because she just knows  it helps.  \n\nI would be livid if someone did this to my kid.", "NTA. Not one clinical trial result yet posted giving a positive recommendation for this seemingly universal and well known remedy for ear infections specifically.  Just a whole lot of \"someone told me\" and quotes from online sources without attribution to a credible source.\n\nIf this really is a magical cure-all, then it's an active medicine and what we have here is a nurse administering a treatment to a child patient without the parent's knowledge or consent. If it's not medicine, then we have a nurse putting her bodily fluids inside a child's ear on the basis of an \"everyone knows\" old wives tale. Unprofessional and overstepping boundaries either way.  The nurse bit makes it worse, not better, as she doesn't even have ignorance of correct consent protocols as an excuse.", "NTA. Whatever they said, she should talk to you first, even if it is another kind of remedy, or even 'conventional' modern medicine. This is less a discourse about what she put in your kid's ear but more about your autonomy as a parent.", "NTA she should behave asked you if you wanted this \"remedy\" applied or not. This reminds me of a story a friend told me about a breastfeeding mom in her neighborhood who decided, since breast milk was \"so healthy\", to mix it with chocolate,  freeze it, and hand it out as Popsicles to the unsuspecting  neighborhood children. The other parents were not pleased when she happily mentioned the \"favor\" she was doing the neighborhood.", "NTA. If she treats ear infections with breast milk, how does she treat fevers? Coughs? Cuts and scrapes? Seizures? Can she be trusted to care for your child when her instinct is (entirely useless) old wives\u2019 tales?", "I put this in a comment, but here you go...\n\nBut it would be an easy question to ask of a parent:\n\n- \"I want to treat your child's ear infection, is that okay?\n- \"It's already being treated, but what are you suggesting?\"\n- \"I want to put my breastmilk in their ear.\"\n- \"No thanks.\"\n\nNot. That. Hard. \n\nDON'T treat someone's child without asking! No matter what it's with! Not if you are NOT the parent!\n\nSimple.\n\nShe boundary-stomped. And when told you weren't okay with what she did, she doubled down. She is not respecting your choice and view as a parent, and views her own opinion as superior.

HIV, Hepatitis and many other Viruses can get into the breast milk. This was crazy unsanitary and i wouldn't let my kid near her again until she apologies", "NTA based on the details currently given in your post. \n\nYou asked if you AITA for banning her from babysitting/being unsupervised. The thing is, that so many commenters are brushing over, it doesn\u2019t matter if she was right or if she is a pediatric nurse. This was not her child. She should have checked in with you first. And when she didn\u2019t and you got upset, she should have realized her oversight and apologized. She can certainly attempt to politely educate you, and I hope you would maturely hear her out and verify it independently if you don\u2019t trust her word alone, but ultimately it was on her to check with the mother of the child in her care before administering anything for medical purposes. I\u2019m not a mom yet, but I have been a nanny. If you were absolutely unreachable and it was an emergency, that is a different story. But this was not an emergency. \n\nThe other reason you are NTA for being wary of her babysitting or being left unsupervised again also has to do with her not checking in with you first/getting permission. If she did this without asking, what other things may she do without checking in the future? Is she the kind of overstepping person (like a ton of people seem to be) who don\u2019t feel a reason to check for permission because they think they know better than the person and should do what they want? (They might actually know better, but still.) I\u2019m not suggesting she will harm your child by doing something, but regardless it is just the right thing to do to respect the child\u2019s parent and check first unless maybe the situation has already happened and permission was already given in the past. \n\nTo me, it does not really matter if she is a pediatric nurse. Any adult in this thread probably has figured out by now that any person in the medical field doesn\u2019t automatically equal a smart, reasonable and well educated person. I have been told things by doctors that are literally disproven by countless articles, and then by OTHER doctors. I\u2019d like to trust any medical professional and what they say, but having one doctor tell me how the other doctor was incorrect (and they are always confidently incorrect of course) just proves it doesn\u2019t mean someone in the medical field\u2019s opinions and choices are always right.\n\nWithout knowing her or her past behavior, just going off of general human being standards - It is unlikely your SIL will harm your child, it is likely she actually is smart and responsible and reasonable. It is likely she did not mean to upset you and thought she was helping. This sounds like a big misunderstanding and miscommunication of boundaries and guidelines relating to your child\u2019s medical needs. What should resolve this, if everyone is a mature adult\u2026is just her apologizing for acting without checking in, you apologizing for a knee jerk yelling reaction, and you two working out how you\u2019d like to handle any medical issues that arise in the future. Once you have those boundaries and guidelines for how you want her to handle medical situations while babysitting clearly in place, if she still violates your wishes then absolutely it is NTA to ban her.\n\nTLDR: It is simple, she should have made sure it was OK with the parent first, pediatric nurse or not.", "NTA.\n\nKeep your bodily fluids to yourself and yours, please.

I'm just wondering if this would have ended up differently if you would have simply placed this boundary prior to arguing with her.\n\nI mean I don't blame you at all. I wouldn't want someone doing this to my child without permission but I do think this could have been handled slightly better especially if she didn't realize you wouldn't be okay with this considering breastmilk is used a LOT by BF moms as a remedy for all sorts of situations. It's almost being normalized and I'd assume she fell into the online trap of assuming this was a no-brainer.

You were looked down upon for breastfeeding like a commoner. Some of these still persist to this day, albeit in the country my parents are from (I'll give you a hint - someplace in Africa). \n\nAlso I had a few aunts say I was being selfish for breastfeeding because now no one else could feed the baby?

No, you can't just slather it on and expect it not to fester.  \n\nOP's child got better because of regression to the mean - ear infections will normally resolve themselves regardless.", "Agreed 100%. In other words, using breast milk for its intended purpose--to feed human babies is its recommended use.", "It does have some topical healing properties, but for like chapped skin, not infections. When my sister was breastfeeding she\u2019d always put a little drop on her lips to moisturize", "There are studies that suggest that if the mother has allergies, there can be a risk of transfering that to the child through the breastmilk. It's not confirmed and there are other studies with different results.", "Exactly- moisture and sugar- bacteria\u2019s favourite things.", "Actually, use this incident as a teaching moment for both the daughter and the SIL. \n\nMake a kid's science experiment out of it: https://learning-center.homesciencetools.com/article/bacteria-experiment-guide/\n\nThis should make the daughter understand why her aunt is not allowed to be alone with her anymore. Also, since the SIL probably has her own baby, the OP should teach the mom about this stuff before she completely fucks up her own baby's ears. And may be the OP should show the brother too, because I'm not entirely sure he fully understands what's going on either.", "I don't have any allergies other than to penicillin. And shockingly he is not allergic to that. Go figure.", "Lmao. When I babysit my baby cousin I don't change his outfit without asking. NTA", "NTA\n\nI would cut off entire anyone that tried that shit with my kids. Absolutely NOT.", "I wouldn\u2019t give someone else\u2019s seven year old anything above some hot tea for a sore throat without asking. NTA", "Gotta admit, reading this made me feel a bit sick.\n\nDefinitely NTA!", "As someone who had chronic ear infections as a baby and small child, I\u2019m horrified. Ear infections aren\u2019t a game, that child is in pain and they probably made it worse and will take longer to recover because of it. Your sil could be causing damage to her ear drums. \n\nAll sil has to say is \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I made a mistake. I shouldn\u2019t have done that without checking with you first.\u201d But instead of prioritizing the child\u2019s welfare she\u2019s defending her ego. \n\nI hope your daughter feels better soon. Earaches suck so much. My ear hurts just thinking about it. \ud83d\ude29", "Have you tried Cheez-its in tomato soup?", "NTA. You really can't just go around sharing body fluids without asking.  Like, sperm contains vitamin C, but you aren't justified in mixing it in my child's oatmeal to prevent scurvy.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t about whether topical application of breastmilk can treat an ear infection (it can\u2019t), it\u2019s about someone putting something in your kids ears without asking you first. It\u2019s effed up.", "WTH. NTA. Your SIL has a lot of nerve taking it into her own hands to put her breastmilk in your child\u2019s ear. No matter her intention. Nearly 15 years ago, my little sister gave birth to my nephew. She tried breastfeeding and her nipples became raw bc my nephew wasn\u2019t latching on properly. I was breastfeeding my son at the time and offered to breastfeed my nephew while my sister\u2019s nipple healed. She gave me permission. I breastfed my nephew.", "NTA. It\u2019s your child and you get to decide who watches them. I probably wouldn\u2019t have yelled and argued though. \n\nYou have given me an idea. I too am looking to get banned from babysitting my nieces and nephews.", "Ya NTA never just treat other people kids without permission always make sure you know what the parents are comfortable with providing to their kids", "Imagine she cured your child\u2019s infection but accidentally infected her with a lifelong disease.\n\nThat\u2019s like if someone said their BIL ejaculated all over his daughter because it\u2019s good for her skin.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t call you first? Get the fuck outta here", "Where did SIL get that breastmilk helps with ear infections?????? School of 1800's? That's just gross.", "If it was my child it would be about the breast milk, I wouldn\u2019t want anyone giving my child their bodily fluids.", "I've dated a nurse before and met a lot of other nurses through her. Tons of rinky dink community colleges with so-so nursing programs turn out droves of subpar nurses every single year. I've met nurses who believe vaccines cause autism. I've met nurses who didn't know you couldn't use antibiotics to treat a viral infection. I've met nurses who freely admitted having their friends do most of their coursework for them. \n\nThey're just people, and just like the general populace, a not insignificant portion of them are dumb as a fucking brick.\n\nEdit: there is also a world of difference between an LPN and an RN or NP. Most of the dumb nurses I know are LPNs.", "\u201cI jammed essential oils and amethyst up my ass but I still have cancer!!! What do!?!?!?\u201d", "honestly now the comment looks out of context because all the comments calling her an ah have been downvoted to hell", "How dare you kink shame me. What I enjoy putting in my ears is my choice.", "As a childfree person, it's wild to me how much non-parent people think they have a right to intervene or interact with a baby. Like, just because this kid shares some of your genes (grandparents, aunt, etc) does not automatically give you the right to feed the kid, much less decide what they're fed! I would never be able to deal with everyone in my business. So sorry you had to put up with all that bullshit. \n\nThe podcast Behind the Bastards did some episodes on how women were purposefully convinced to switch to formula to make money for the producers and how that then went on to kill lots of babies due to contaminated formula. Such a messed up world we live in. Sigh.", "Have you tried pouring honey in his ears and rubbing breast milk on his feet? \n\nCures all the poxes a boy brings home! Try arranging some amethyst gems in the south west of his room on a Thursday every fortnight to enhance the healing properties."]}
