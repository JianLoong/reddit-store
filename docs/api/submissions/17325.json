It was my mums friend and her 2 kids. The boy is 5 and the girl is 13. Id bought some donuts to eat and I was eating them in the same room as everyone else as we were all having a discussion about an upcoming event. As soon as the guests leave my mother immediately gets onto me about how I was rude to eat in front of everyone without offering. In my opinion I shouldn\u2019t have to offer my food when 1. They came unannounced and I only had 2 doughnuts and 2. I paid for them so I can do what I please with them. \n\nWe had an argument about how it\u2019s just rude and how I come across as rubbing it in their face. When I was young I was never bothered by people eating in their own home. To me it\u2019s ridiculous to have to offer food. And I probably shouldn\u2019t have eaten them in the same room but we were all planning things so I had to be in the room. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I was not the host to be declining guests that is my mothers job. We are from England. And I also don\u2019t particularly understand how not offering food is rude? I\u2019m not a waiter and my home is not a restaurant. If someone is hungry that is their responsibility to feed themselves not mine.

It was my mums friend and her 2 kids. The boy is 5 and the girl is 13. Id bought some donuts to eat and I was eating them in the same room as everyone else as we were all having a discussion about an upcoming event. As soon as the guests leave my mother immediately gets onto me about how I was rude to eat in front of everyone without offering. In my opinion I shouldn\u2019t have to offer my food when 1. They came unannounced and I only had 2 doughnuts and 2. I paid for them so I can do what I please with them. \n\nWe had an argument about how it\u2019s just rude and how I come across as rubbing it in their face. When I was young I was never bothered by people eating in their own home. To me it\u2019s ridiculous to have to offer food. And I probably shouldn\u2019t have eaten them in the same room but we were all planning things so I had to be in the room.

Who cares if someone is eating donuts in front of someone else??    Pretty much everything else EVER is more important than freaking donuts.

Just because they're not paying for it like they would in a restaurant doesn't mean that it isn't still your job the second you agree to be a host.\n\nDon't want the responsibility? Do what I used to do as a teenager when my parents had unexpected guests over: grab your food for yourself and hole yourself up in your room until they leave.", "You don't eat in front of them if you have basic social skills, that's all.

You're thirsty, so you offer the guest a glass of water/ cup of tea. You get hungry, you get a pax of crisps and offer the person you're hanging out with to have a couple. Then it's on the other person to also be polite and only grab one or two.\n\nBesides, this is a mother telling her child how to behave according to their culture/ family values. How is everyone here so pissed over a parent doing their job?", "Many cultures see showing up uninvited as a perfectly legit way to spend time together. Speculating on whether or not it's rude is irrelevant, because that's not the point of this AITA, the point is \"is it rude to eat in front of guests without sharing\". OP even states that this was \"completely fine\" so trying to redirect the debate on this doesn't make sense.\n\nWhat does make sense, however, is answering the initial question, and for many people here (OP's mother included), OP is TA here. Of course, eating your own food in front of guests is not the cruelest thing in the world, and I don't believe OP had ill intentions at all, but it's a small social mistake that could easily be avoided in the future. Eating in another room or offering to share (which would probably be rejected anyway if the guests are also polite) is just kinder, and it's one of those things that may seem pointless, but it makes most people feel more welcome. You won't change the world by doing so, but you'll just be a little bit more thoughtful, a little bit kinder, so why not?\n\nSo imo OP, you're a soft YTA because I think you might just be clueless and new social rules always seem pointless when we're just learning them, but they exist for a reason. For example, when I was 14 I thought that when my friend said \"naaah you don't have to get me anything for my birthday it's fine \ud83d\ude0f\" , they really meant it. Well it took many fights with my mother for me to finally consent in buying a single candy bag (I know it was a shitty gift, but at least I listened to my mom haha), and I realised I owed her when I saw everybody had bought gifts anyway and I would have looked like an asshole. (ofc I know some people really don't want anything for their birthday, but it's usually adults who make it explicitly clear they don't want anything, when people are just saying that they're usually trying to be polite) (which is a pain because I'd rather have a blunt friend tell me what they want than having to ask my mom what I should do)", "Yeah", "Yes.", "It\u2019s not an \u2018unspoken rule\u2019 it\u2019s just common courtesy", "INFO had you started eating before or after they arrived?", "Problem is that you technically can eat, but it's rude to eat in front of other people without offering to share.

The economy is in shambles, I can barely afford to feed myself, but you\u2019re entitled to my food because you showed up to my house uninvited? Should I also offer you a shower and a nap on my couch since I\u2019m apparently responsible for your needs? It\u2019s also pretty socially backwards imo, I want my friends to share things with me because they want to, not because they\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll think they\u2019re impolite if they don\u2019t. Making it \u201cmandatory\u201d completely removes all the feelings of actual connection and hospitality for me - you\u2019re not being kind because you care about me, you\u2019re being kind because you think you have to.", "No, the OP was the one chomping down donuts in front of the guests. It was on the OP to either refrain, leave the room or offer to some of the donuts to the guests. Her mother would have been just a much of an ass if she had offered the guests some of OPs donuts.", "If you invite people into your home, you are now obligated to be hospitable. \n\nThere are accepted ways to not invite people in:\n\n1) simply don't answer the door\n2) answer the door and say \"I'm sorry, I'm right in the middle of something. Can I text you later?\"\n\nIf the child was already eating the donut when the unexpected visitors arrived, I would allow them to finish. However, if the gusts were already there, I would not allow my child to start eating the donut, either, until the guests left.", ">The guest isn't the one complaining here.\n\nCorrect, the mother is mis-representing/creating the guest response.  A guest response that would be really massively unreasonable for a guest to have.  Hence it's unreasonable for the mother to use that as an excuse.  Which is what she's doing.\n\nThe guests may well have been reasonable people who didn't give a shit, probably didn't register on their radar.  It wouldn't for most guests, because it's properly shit thoughts to think.  So the mum is being an AH by creating a situation where the guests would have to be massive AHs to have a problem with it.\n\nStarts to make the mum look like a coward hiding behind imagined guest responses doesn't it?  Worse than that, it makes the guests look bad when they did nothing wrong.  Sheesh, it's like the mother is just grabbing all of the assholery for herself, save some for the rest of us mumsie dearest.  AND NEXT TIME PROVIDE TEA AND BISCUITS PLEASE AND THANK YOU.", "It could very much be cultural. The only reason I'd say it's *not* cultural, and this is purely anecdotally, but I've been to the homes of catholic friends, muslim friends, white friends, black friends, etc. etc. in my bit of america, and none of them ever really considered it odd to offer food to whoever popped by.", "Called at the door expecting a beer, a bowl of stew, a roof and a tale or two. Got shot in the face instead.", "It seems 100x more rude to expect someone to not be able to eat in their own home simply because you don't get some of it", "K", "You are way overcomplicating this.  It is simply good manners to eat your snack in the other room or save it for later.  Mom is not a coward for reminding her kid of good manners(!!)", "I guess it depends on what we mean by culture. My mom is from Mexico, my dad is Dutch and I grew up between those countries, though more in Mexico. In Mexico on the one hand, and there, regardless of religion or race, this was my experience, people were always welcome. The other was Dutch, where they would ask you to leave if you were showed up at dinner. Though I had less adult interaction in Holland so have fewer data points, my mom did live there for a number of years while married to my dad, and this was her experience. \n\nBut regardless, it doesn't mean one of you had rude friends and the other didn't.", "You can still eat in your own home. Just not in front of the guests.", ">You are way overcomplicating this.  It is simply good manners to eat your snack in the other room or save it for later\n\nNope, OP is doing their own thing, eating their own food businesses.  Mum's friend turns up for a random vists, OP comes and joins them for a chat (whilst daring to eat.)  It's not a big deal, even a small deal, it's not an issue at all among reasonable people.\n\nMum is a coward here, she wouldn't be if she just left it.  The reason being, if she's worried about good hosting and manners, it is good hosting and manners to offer something to your guests.  NOT your child's food.\n\nRemember, this is a random visit, the fine china isn't coming out here.  OP is doing their own thing, guests come over, OP comes and joins.  The mother is being very ill-mannered by not hosting her guests properly and then putting it on OP who just \"turned up\" because they happen to live there.\n\nThis is not teaching manners, this is shifting blame."]}
