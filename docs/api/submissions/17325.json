They came unannounced and I only had 2 doughnuts and 2. I paid for them so I can do what I please with them. \n\nWe had an argument about how it\u2019s just rude and how I come across as rubbing it in their face. When I was young I was never bothered by people eating in their own home. To me it\u2019s ridiculous to have to offer food.

It was my mums friend and her 2 kids. The boy is 5 and the girl is 13. Id bought some donuts to eat and I was eating them in the same room as everyone else as we were all having a discussion about an upcoming event. As soon as the guests leave my mother immediately gets onto me about how I was rude to eat in front of everyone without offering. In my opinion I shouldn\u2019t have to offer my food when 1. They came unannounced and I only had 2 doughnuts and 2. I paid for them so I can do what I please with them. \n\nWe had an argument about how it\u2019s just rude and how I come across as rubbing it in their face. When I was young I was never bothered by people eating in their own home. To me it\u2019s ridiculous to have to offer food. And I probably shouldn\u2019t have eaten them in the same room but we were all planning things so I had to be in the room.

OP didn\u2019t invite these people over.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like OP knew about the rules in advance", "I respectfully disagree. NTA.", "Precisely this. While I can understand how it comes across I have never been offended or jealous of someone eating food at THEIR a house. House party? Sure if your all ordering food and not offering. But an uninvited visit definitely not", "became their mothers guests meaning it was on her to offer anything OP is in the clear", "The guest isn't the one complaining here.  The mom said it was rude to eat in front of guests.  And it is!", "Seriously. \u201cI\u2019m here now, so I hope you weren\u2019t expecting to do anything other than cater to my unexpected visit. Starve to death, or let us sit here and wonder why you hate us as you eat in another room, these are your options.\u201d Insanity.", "But OP was engaging with them... they were all engaging in a discussion. So your point about the guests interrupting the day is sort of moot...OP chose to participate in the visit. \n\nIf OP was in their room and wasn't expected to be a part of the visit, then eating donuts privately wouldn't be an issue.", "If your plans were to sit butt naked on the couch and watch a slasher movie, would you not consider changing the plan when guests arrive, even if they were unplanned? The guests suck for turning up unexpected but so does the person that continues their plan regardless. Either leave the room or wait until the guests leave.", "You make a plan to eat donuts?  And nothing can deter you from your appointment with the donut?\n\nI'm laughing out loud right now.", "\"Plans to eat donuts\", LOL! I wonder if OP had it on their to-do list for the day. \"10:30 AM - Eat donuts\"\n\nThere are all sorts of reasons that plans get screwed up every day.  It's irritating as hell, but it's just reality. \n\nIn general Western etiquette, it is usually considered rude to *begin* to eat something in front of others without offering some to them, even if they show up at your home unannounced.  That said, it's also considered rude to show up at someone's house unannounced.  No single person came up with these \"rules\", they're just, well, part of tHe CuLtUrE in the West.  \n\nI must say, though, I wonder if anyone would have less been offended if OP was eating overcooked  Brussels sprouts or something generally less palatable than donuts. It would still *technically* be considered rude by etiquette standards, but in reality probably wouldn't have offended anyone, because...ewwww.", "Or maybe OP didn't know the friend was coming over before showing up, but their mom did. It would have *seemed* unannounced to OP in that case.", "No, the OP decided to stay and participate in the conversation, so then the host duties also fell on them.", "I got the feeling the mom forced her to interact", "If you ran a bath with a glass of wine and got in when the doorbell rings, would you jump out and drain your bath to entertain uninvited guests?", "If it was my home and my guests I would have turned them away but seeing as it is my mother\u2019s friend it is not my place to turn someone away", "I'd send uninvited guests away if that's my plan. If someone shows up uninvited or unannounced that's just about the rudest thing they can do to me, and they are welcome to sit there with me and my penis out watching that slasher. In the world of cellphones the rudest thing you can do is just show up without letting someone know. We are past that as a society.", "These weren\u2019t even her friends or guests, though. And if she stopped to buy them on the way home, she probably had plans to eat them when she got there. I just don\u2019t see it as a huge deal since the guests weren\u2019t even invited.", "That\u2019s like coming home and your roommate has friends over so you can\u2019t eat the snack you bought lol", "Could be. Still rude to use that time to eat", "Equating eating donuts to getting in a bathtub with a glass of wine is a crazy take", "If you're in your mom's house, and her guests need to use the bathroom, sorry, you've got to gulp your wine and leave the bath early.", "Same here", "Or maybe OP didn't know the friend was coming over before showing up, but their mom did. It would have *seemed* unannounced to OP in that case.  Of course, mom should probably have given a heads up to OP that the friend was coming then.\n\nI 100% agree with you that in the general scheme of things, it absolutely isn't a huge deal.  Who cares if someone is eating donuts in front of someone else??    Pretty much everything else EVER is more important than freaking donuts.  Also, so much stuff that is considered \"etiquette\" is actually pretty petty and basically for show anyway. And it changes over time.  An example: I'm probably way older than you but when I was a little kid it was considered poor etiquette for women to wear white before Memorial Day and after Labor Day. Seriously, how dumb is that? Anyone who actually gives a fuck what color your shoes are in October is obviously a very shallow and dimwitted person.\n\nStill, it's just helpful to at least know what is considered rude by current etiquette standards to not alienate someone else or embarrass oneself, just in case one finds themselves in a situation they wouldn't normally be in. Like, I dunno, having your boss' boss over for dinner or something. Yes, it's incredibly stupid, I know, but it might save a lot of hassle or controversy later.  Basically, learning it can be helpful to have that stuff filed away,  even if you never have to use it. Otherwise, like you said, it's not really a big deal.  There are SO many things to worry about that are actually important.", "Eh- except when you are talking about roommates, you are talking about two adults in a living situation who have separate lives. In this case OP is in their mom\u2019s house.", "I was comparing it to the watching a movie naked thing from the other comment, but honestly, I don\u2019t care about this donut as much as y\u2019all do lol. I made my judgement and I\u2019m moving on.", "fuck that they can go outside", "Haha I remember the white after Labor Day thing (bet I\u2019m not younger lol)\n\nFair take btw", "Still not OP\u2019s guests, though"]}
