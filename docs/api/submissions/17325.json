It was my mums friend and her 2 kids. The boy is 5 and the girl is 13. Id bought some donuts to eat and I was eating them in the same room as everyone else as we were all having a discussion about an upcoming event. As soon as the guests leave my mother immediately gets onto me about how I was rude to eat in front of everyone without offering. In my opinion I shouldn\u2019t have to offer my food when 1. They came unannounced and I only had 2 doughnuts and 2. I paid for them so I can do what I please with them. \n\nWe had an argument about how it\u2019s just rude and how I come across as rubbing it in their face. When I was young I was never bothered by people eating in their own home. To me it\u2019s ridiculous to have to offer food. And I probably shouldn\u2019t have eaten them in the same room but we were all planning things so I had to be in the room. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I was not the host to be declining guests that is my mothers job. We are from England. And I also don\u2019t particularly understand how not offering food is rude? I\u2019m not a waiter and my home is not a restaurant. If someone is hungry that is their responsibility to feed themselves not mine.

It was my mums friend and her 2 kids. The boy is 5 and the girl is 13. Id bought some donuts to eat and I was eating them in the same room as everyone else as we were all having a discussion about an upcoming event. As soon as the guests leave my mother immediately gets onto me about how I was rude to eat in front of everyone without offering. In my opinion I shouldn\u2019t have to offer my food when 1. They came unannounced and I only had 2 doughnuts and 2. I paid for them so I can do what I please with them. \n\nWe had an argument about how it\u2019s just rude and how I come across as rubbing it in their face. When I was young I was never bothered by people eating in their own home. To me it\u2019s ridiculous to have to offer food. And I probably shouldn\u2019t have eaten them in the same room but we were all planning things so I had to be in the room.

Who cares if someone is eating donuts in front of someone else??    Pretty much everything else EVER is more important than freaking donuts.

Just because they're not paying for it like they would in a restaurant doesn't mean that it isn't still your job the second you agree to be a host.\n\nDon't want the responsibility? Do what I used to do as a teenager when my parents had unexpected guests over: grab your food for yourself and hole yourself up in your room until they leave.", "You don't eat in front of them if you have basic social skills, that's all.

You're thirsty, so you offer the guest a glass of water/ cup of tea. You get hungry, you get a pax of crisps and offer the person you're hanging out with to have a couple. Then it's on the other person to also be polite and only grab one or two.\n\nBesides, this is a mother telling her child how to behave according to their culture/ family values. How is everyone here so pissed over a parent doing their job?", "Many cultures see showing up uninvited as a perfectly legit way to spend time together. Speculating on whether or not it's rude is irrelevant, because that's not the point of this AITA, the point is \"is it rude to eat in front of guests without sharing\". OP even states that this was \"completely fine\" so trying to redirect the debate on this doesn't make sense.\n\nWhat does make sense, however, is answering the initial question, and for many people here (OP's mother included), OP is TA here. Of course, eating your own food in front of guests is not the cruelest thing in the world, and I don't believe OP had ill intentions at all, but it's a small social mistake that could easily be avoided in the future. Eating in another room or offering to share (which would probably be rejected anyway if the guests are also polite) is just kinder, and it's one of those things that may seem pointless, but it makes most people feel more welcome. You won't change the world by doing so, but you'll just be a little bit more thoughtful, a little bit kinder, so why not?\n\nSo imo OP, you're a soft YTA because I think you might just be clueless and new social rules always seem pointless when we're just learning them, but they exist for a reason. For example, when I was 14 I thought that when my friend said \"naaah you don't have to get me anything for my birthday it's fine \ud83d\ude0f\" , they really meant it. Well it took many fights with my mother for me to finally consent in buying a single candy bag (I know it was a shitty gift, but at least I listened to my mom haha), and I realised I owed her when I saw everybody had bought gifts anyway and I would have looked like an asshole. (ofc I know some people really don't want anything for their birthday, but it's usually adults who make it explicitly clear they don't want anything, when people are just saying that they're usually trying to be polite) (which is a pain because I'd rather have a blunt friend tell me what they want than having to ask my mom what I should do)", "Yeah", "Yes.", "It\u2019s not an \u2018unspoken rule\u2019 it\u2019s just common courtesy", "INFO had you started eating before or after they arrived?", "Problem is that you technically can eat, but it's rude to eat in front of other people without offering to share.
