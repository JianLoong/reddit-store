The whole point was to ease your mom\u2019s financial burden, there\u2019s no financial aspect of attending parents evenings and college events.", "NTA\n\nIt is very strange that your mother is refusing to do anything for your brother now that he has moved in with you, even going to parent evening events which will have no impact on her finances.\n\nI suggest doing a wellness check on her. Visit with her and see if she is okay. See if she is sober and if you see signs of a mental break.\n\nI can understand her needing help financially, but she\u2019s pretty much abandoned your brother to your care, which is very concerning behavior.", "INFO:  Is your mother his legal guardian still? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf that is the case NTA. His mother is still responsible for all of those things regardless of where he lives. Until he turns 18, he is her responsibility.", "NTA\n\nMight be a leap but are you UK? I bet Mum's still getting the child benefit. Something to think about it she's not helping.", "NTA. \n\nYou and your partner have done something supportive for your mum and brother. It\u2019s a shame that your mother thinks you\u2019ve taken on all parental responsibilities but maybe a warning flag that you might need to do more for your brother even if you didn\u2019t sign up for it. From the sounds of it, it feels like your mum is trying to shrug him off onto you and (from experience) this can be damaging for your brother too. Was there a lack of communication with your mother before he moved in? Did you not discuss how it would work?\n\nIf I were you I would spend some time with your brother supporting him to be more independent. The job sounds like a great start and very supportive and helpful of you. Parents evening is important at that age and if you could squeeze the time, I think it\u2019s important someone goes who is investing time and energy into him. Dr and dentist appointments, maybe you can support him in booking and organising the first time, so he can do it independently next time? \n\nGood brother medal for you. Sorry you are in this position without signing up for it", "Nta, your mom is pawning him off and is trying to get out of being a parent. Go to her and hash this out away from your brother, if she continues, you need to sue her for child support.", "NTA. But you need to CYA on this. If your mother is somehow incapable of financially or emotionally or physically caring for your brother, you need to get his status as your ward or you as his guardian on paper so you're not a party to whatever neglect charges your mother might catch. Plus, usually the state pays a stipend to guardians. It's not fair to you or to him that you have all the responsibilities of a parent but none of the benefits.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to provide for his caretaking.

Kudoes for stepping up and being an awesome big brother.  \n\nParents' evenings?  Sounds more like she disowned your brother than just asked you to babysit/foster long term.  That's just weird.
