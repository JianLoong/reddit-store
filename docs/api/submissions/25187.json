The whole point was to ease your mom\u2019s financial burden, there\u2019s no financial aspect of attending parents evenings and college events.", "NTA\n\nIt is very strange that your mother is refusing to do anything for your brother now that he has moved in with you, even going to parent evening events which will have no impact on her finances.\n\nI suggest doing a wellness check on her. Visit with her and see if she is okay. See if she is sober and if you see signs of a mental break.\n\nI can understand her needing help financially, but she\u2019s pretty much abandoned your brother to your care, which is very concerning behavior.", "INFO:  Is your mother his legal guardian still? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf that is the case NTA. His mother is still responsible for all of those things regardless of where he lives. Until he turns 18, he is her responsibility.", "NTA\n\nMight be a leap but are you UK? I bet Mum's still getting the child benefit. Something to think about it she's not helping.", "NTA. \n\nYou and your partner have done something supportive for your mum and brother. It\u2019s a shame that your mother thinks you\u2019ve taken on all parental responsibilities but maybe a warning flag that you might need to do more for your brother even if you didn\u2019t sign up for it. From the sounds of it, it feels like your mum is trying to shrug him off onto you and (from experience) this can be damaging for your brother too. Was there a lack of communication with your mother before he moved in? Did you not discuss how it would work?\n\nIf I were you I would spend some time with your brother supporting him to be more independent. The job sounds like a great start and very supportive and helpful of you. Parents evening is important at that age and if you could squeeze the time, I think it\u2019s important someone goes who is investing time and energy into him. Dr and dentist appointments, maybe you can support him in booking and organising the first time, so he can do it independently next time? \n\nGood brother medal for you. Sorry you are in this position without signing up for it", "Nta, your mom is pawning him off and is trying to get out of being a parent. Go to her and hash this out away from your brother, if she continues, you need to sue her for child support.", "NTA. But you need to CYA on this. If your mother is somehow incapable of financially or emotionally or physically caring for your brother, you need to get his status as your ward or you as his guardian on paper so you're not a party to whatever neglect charges your mother might catch. Plus, usually the state pays a stipend to guardians. It's not fair to you or to him that you have all the responsibilities of a parent but none of the benefits.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to provide for his caretaking.

Kudoes for stepping up and being an awesome big brother.  \n\nParents' evenings?  Sounds more like she disowned your brother than just asked you to babysit/foster long term.  That's just weird. Why doesn't she want to be his Mom any more?", "Thank you I was thinking the same thing and it\u2019s not up to me to parent my brother just help me mam a little", "I was thinking the same thing I do know my mother is sober maybe she\u2019s struggling mentally I\u2019ll speak to her about it", "Yes my mother is still his legal guardian he just lives with me", "Thanks Man I appreciate the advice I definitely wanna help my brother as much as I can I want him to be independent and ready for adult life", "I\u2019m happy to feed him and such because that was the point of us taking him but I\u2019m not happy with the whole attending his parents evening situation as i am clearly not his parent. I also work full time and do late and early shifts so it\u2019s not easy for me to attend those thing anyways", "Thanks man i didn\u2019t think it was right either I\u2019ve never heard that term before but it makes sense to me.", "I hope she\u2019s okay and that your talk with her brings about some answers.", "Thanks man I hope so too", "NTA\n\nActually, you are doing a great service for your family.  Teaching your brother how to be a functioning adult is a great way to go about helping.  Your mother needs to remember she is the parent, I wonder if she is depressed or otherwise mentally ill.  I hope you can figure something out with her.  Keep doing what you're doing.  You brother will look back and know what you did for him.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is sad your mom is an AH and a shitty parent, but you do not have to take over for her.", "NTA. Sounds like mom has abandoned your brother though. I would seek out legal guardianship for two reasons. 1. He needs stability until he gets on his feet. Having a mom who is ignoring him while living with you is a precarious position as she may decide to yank him back for whatever reason. 2. You can get the appropriate benefits and tax breaks for a dependent under your care.\n\nYou don't have to be a 'dad.' But you are going to have to do more than you signed up for. And this is not about helping mom out, this is about doing what's best for your brother.\n\nI commend you for stepping up. You're a good brother.\n\nEdit: Brother not sister.", "NTA... \n\nTell her if she expects all that then you will get custody and then file for child support. \n\nYour mom sucks and is just trying to milk this.", "NTA, but it sounds like your family could use support from someone who can help you talk through responsibilities. A 16-year-old still needs a parent, not just room and board. It's wonderful that you were willing to help, but that doesn't automatically mean that this setup is right for your brother or the adults involved.\n\nCould you reach out to a counselor/social worker at your brother's school, to let them know the situation and find out what support might be available for you all?", "Tell mom it is her legal obligation to support her minor children.  Remind her you are helping because she needs financial relief but if she intends you to become his caretaker, she will have have to give up custody of him legally and pay you child support and will no linger be able to claim him as a dependent.  Further she will have to cover his health care", "Thank you I really hope so, I never had anyone to teach me these things so I don\u2019t want the same thing to happen to him you know", "Thanks for your kind words but I\u2019m actually the brother \ud83d\ude05 sorry if I wasn\u2019t clear in my writing I\u2019m new to posting on Reddit", "I could take a look he\u2019s starting college soon so there\u2019s ways and means to help I\u2019m sure", "Are you Welsh by any chance?", "INFO: Why didn't you just send money if it was financial help your mom needed?", "So many parents are forgetting they are supposed to be raising adults, not children.  Happy you are breaking that cycle for your brother.", "Nope, that was me reading your post twice and still missing that.", "Ah no problem friend these things happen, thanks again for your kind words I appreciate it \ud83d\ude0a", "Ask your brother what he wants. He may not even want anyone to go to those things. But if he is living with you going to the parents' night would probably be best. You can g and idea of how he is doing and what he needs help with. As for colleges your input might be good as you are older. I would not want my kid or sibling going to a party school.", "NTA, your mom should not be putting that on you. HOWEVER, it seems pretty clear that she doesn't want to make an effort, and I'm sure it means a lot to your brother for you to pick up her slack and be there for him. Yes it sucks to have to take on that parent role, but it sucks more to be a teen and think that you're a huge burden. I'd continue doing what you can, and the things you can't attend, ask your mom if she'll be there.", "NTA It's nice enough of you to be willing to let him move in to ease financial pressure off of her. Expecting you to take over parenting entirely is not reasonable.", "NTA but I would check in to see how your mother is doing mentally and speak to her about it", "Might want to call CPS.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nParentification is a form of abuse.", "NTA. Tell her you will be going to the courts for child support.", "INFO: if you don't do it, will she ?", "NTA\n\nYou were told it was for financial reasons, In reality it sounds like your mum has just had enough with him and transferred the parent role to you.", "I thought that too, although tbf, if OP has another sibling his brother might be child number 3, which would explain the financial issues.\n\nWith all the other crap though it\u2019s much more likely she\u2019s just trying to pawn of the responsibility of raising her son.\n\nOP should tell his mam that they can make this arrangement official, and transfer legal custody, along with child benefits and tax credits and watch how quickly she turns up to parents night and doctors appointments then.", "Surely Scottish", "Or Irish", "Or Geordie.", "I will point out that if your mom is no longer involved with him on a daily basis or involved with his education, there\u2019s really not a lot of point to her attending parent nights. Those are more useful for whoever is supporting bro in his educational goals, parent or otherwise. If bro is going it alone, no one need show.", "> She know seems to think I am his legal guardian\n\nINFO. Huh?\n\nAre you or are you not his legal guardian?", "NTA. Your mother still has parental responsibilities here. You don\u2019t go to any of his school stuff and let her continue to organise his doctor/dental appointments. Be hands off and if she doesn\u2019t like it tell her she\u2019s welcome to take him back.", "La Forge?", "Something is missing here, what\u2019s going on with mom? Is this brother impossible for her to manage? \n\nRegardless, good job stepping up \u2026.sounds like a pretty big job\u2026. Guiding him to adulthood is a huge responsibility but sounds like you are on the right track.", "She obviously doesn't want him anymore, so tell her you're gonna to the court to adopt him and see what happens....I think she'll change her attitude...nta", "NTA. You\u2019re helping take the financial burden from your mom but she seems to be taking this a step farther and giving you the parenting responsibilities too.", "NTA. It sounds kinda like your mother has decided that she's done being a parent and expects you to finish the job for her.", "NTA - he is your brother not your child. It would be different if your mother wasn\u2019t alive but she is and needs to take responsibility for her actions. She can\u2019t decide she done being a mother", "He is your BROTHER, not your child, and therefore, your mother should be the one to attend all the things you mentioned in your op.\n\nI personally would tell her that she needs to get off her duff and help him with these things as she is his legal guardian and that it is NOT up to you to parent him.\n\nShe needs to buy his food, clothing, and school supplies as it is NOT your responsibility to do so.", "NTA ... but please consider your poor brother. \n\nThis 16 year old kid has been essentially abandoned by your mother. Now you are refusing to \"parent\" him - rightfully so - but where does that leave him? This is not your responsibility but you may be the best chance he has to become a stable, productive adult.", "you're being taking advantage of", "Your womb provider just dumped her child.  Throw away kid?  Screw her problems.  I'd take her to court for child support.  Then NC."]}
