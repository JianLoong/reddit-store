His daughter would get an engagement ring from her future fianc\u00e9. It's just a poor excuse to get the ring for his new girlfriend.", "NTA. With your son it will stay in the family as well and you both agreed on that. It's up to your son, when he is an adult, to decide on this matter.", "NTA. I have a inkling he has intentions on giving it to his new girlfriend down the road and not his daughter. It\u2019s specific in the divorce decree it goes to your son. Now, when said son is 18, if he wants to give it to his dad, it\u2019s in his right to do so. But that would be his decision.", "It sounds like dad is choosing his daughter over his son. How is passing the ring down to the son making it leave the family? Is the son not part of the family now?", "NTA\n\nThis honestly sounds like something that his gf asked for. Why would he put it in the divorce agreement to give to the son and all of a sudden change his mind?\n\nIt makes sense to give it to the son in order for him to use it as an engagement ring when the time comes. Maybe if the son doesn't get married or have kids, but the daughter does, it can be passed down to her. But if his concern is for it to stay in the family, then there shouldn't be an issue with the son having it.", "NTA - that ring is yours by virtue of the legal agreement in your divorce. It's traditional that if the bride breaks the engagement, she returns the ring. However, multiple years of marriage and a child would seem to make that tradition rather moot in this case. That ring is yours to keep and give to your son if you so desire. I hope your ex isn't going to screw up what appears to be an amiable co-parenting situation with this misguided demand.", "Eh, seems pretty cut and dried, NTA", "NTA If your former husband wanted the ring, the the time to bring it up was during your divorce negotiations not three years later. He may badger you all he wants but what's done is done, the ring is yours per the settlement. If his family wanted to \"keep it on the family\" it should have been given to a female relative not an in law.", "NTA as it was agreed upon in the divorce. Was he going to use it as an engagement ring for the new gf?\n\nIf your son doesn't want to use it down the road, he can always gift it to his sister.", "NTA. you fulfilled the obligations of the conditional gift of the engagement ring by entering into the marriage.  \n\nHe would only have grounds to reclaim it if you ended the *engagement*", "NTA. \n\nAn engagement ring is *a gift in anticipation of marriage*. You married him. It's yours.\n\nEdited to add: if you don't still have a lawyer complain to the court that he is harassing you. Idk the process, but it's not legal for him to do this.", "It\u2019s in the divorce agreement and he wants to renegotiate so he can give it to his new partner, I\u2019m guessing. \n\nOf course you\u2019re NTA", "NTA\nIt was agreed upon in the divorce paperwork. Just because he now has a daughter doesn\u2019t magically change a legal document.", "NTA.\n\nI don't doubt that your ex-husband had his reasons for letting you keep the ring, but whatever they were, that's your ring.\n\nIf you want to keep it, or trade it for something else, that's fine, but you have no moral obligation to return it.\n\nWho knows, maybe your daughter will want it as an engagement ring when she's old enough, and maybe you'll want to give it to her.", "NTA. It is your ring. Your divorce decree settled that issue. Your husband now wants it without any consideration.  If it is important to him, appraise it and sell it to him for fair market value. \n\nFrankly, it would be weird for him to propose with the same ring and as a second wife, that would be a hard no for me. But if that is what he wants to do, let him pay you.", "It sounds like he doesn't consider his son part of his family NTA. It's in the divorce agreement \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA - its your ring and its already been decided what happens with it.", "NTA giving it to his son IS keeping it in the family. The only AH here is your ex.", "That doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026in order for it to stay in the family it would need to go to your son since your son has his last name and would likely be the one to propose to someone. It\u2019s already \u201cin the family\u201d since it was given to your son. \n\nAre you sure he doesn\u2019t want it back to actually give it to his new girlfriend to ask her to marry him? Not that I know anyone in this story in real life (lol), but I guarantee he\u2019s lying to you. \n\nNTA", "NTA. So he hates his son enough to suggest his son is either not part of the family or won't be getting married? Sounds like he's too much of a coward to admit he wants to give it to his gf--in which case, you'd still be right to decline.", "NTA, your husband should never agreed to let you take the ring via the divorce agreement.  But he did, so that is that.", "NTA. He probably just wants to give it to his new gf. If he potentially wanted to give it to anyone besides your son he should not have agreed to let you have it. He could have kept it and still given it to your son.", "NTA.\n\nIt's pretty customary to give the wedding band back, but honestly unless the engagement ring was *specifically asked for* in the divorce, everyone I know who has gone through it has kept it and done whatever they please with it. \n\nHe should have asked during negotiations; negotiations are over. He can badger til he's blue but it's your ring and your choice.\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA, but I have mixed emotions. The agreement was that it would be passed on to the son. I hope the son has a prenup with his wife that states that the ring must be returned in the event they divorce. I had a friend who passed down a four carat two diamond wedding ring from her grandmother to her son.  The son married and eventually divorced.  The ex-wife refused to return the ring. I think this was what the ex-husband meant. If the ring is passed on to a daughter, even if the daughter divorces, the ring stays in the family.  I am on your side though. You have a legal agreement on your side.", "NTA: he should have never let you have the ring in the divorce. But he did and you are honoring his wish to keep it in the family by eventually giving it to your son. If your son chooses when he is an adult he can decide if he wants his sister to have the ring. \n\nTruthfully be clear with that that in your LEGAL divorce papers, it indicates the ring is yours. You will be giving the ring to your son when he wants to propose. And then tell him that it is the end of the discussion.", "NTA - his son IS \"his family\" and, I presume, he gave it to you so your son will give it to his intended when the time comes. IF, for some reason, your son turns out to be gay or doesn't get married, I can see changing the agreement - but that is a long way away.", "NAH \nHonestly this is such a rough situation. The original agreement sounds like such a lovely solution but I can understand why he would feel the way he does as well... \n\nIf there are multiple gems in the ring, you could consider giving each child one of them and then you two deciding what to do with the rest of the ring. That's a big what if type assumption but both kids get an even share of their ancestry and then you two sound respectful and amicable enough to figure out the rest.\n\nI wish I had better advice. Good luck,  OP. I hope this all works out well for you", "YTA. It is a family heirloom and you are no longer part of the family.", "If it\u2019s being handed down to the biological offspring of yourself and him, then, nope, NAH.\n\nIf the child is yours alone from a former relationship then YAH", "NAH. Yes, you technically get to do it your way since it was set by the divorce agreement. But for what gain? It\u2019s his family\u2019s heirloom. Why shouldn\u2019t he get to decide how it is handed down?", "YTA \n\nI mean seriously why are you so invested in this other family's heirloom? What's the story you're going to tell your son? \"Here, have your estranged father's keepsake to give to the love of your life, make sure she knows it's emotionally entangled in a bunch of bullshit she has no stake in or historical connection to\"?\n\nYou should be cutting those ties, not tying your future generations into the same crap.", "YTA\n\nSuper petty, you're just doing this to be an asshole and nothing you can say could convince me otherwise.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your ex just wants to use it on his new girlfriend.   But if they end up divorcing, she would keep the ring.   \n\nIf they're daughter gets married, her future husband would buy a new ring.  So that doesn't even make sense.\n\nIt is your ring and you have a solid agreement to keep it.  Just because he no longer likes the terms, doesn't mean you have to give it back.  It is your ring!!  To do with as you choose.", "NTA\n\n\u201cThat way it would stay in his family forever.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s telling on himself here if he thinks that the ring going to his son isn\u2019t keeping it in his family.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s yours and there is already an agreement that it goes to your son WHO IS ONLY FIVE. Why is this being discussed now??\n\nI wouldn\u2019t argue about it, just say there are a lot of years before either child will need an engagement ring and you can talk about it again in 15 years or so. By then the kids will be old enough to weigh in - could be neither one wants it. At least you\u2019ll know where it is and it\u2019s not being sold or given to the new gf.", "NTA. He can suck it up, it was in the agreement. It\u2019s very strange that he\u2019s backing out of this specific thing.", "NTA the ring is yours until your son is old enough to need it. If he decides later in life that he doesn\u2019t want to gift it to his partner, he can gift it to his child. Just because his dad now has a daughter, that doesn\u2019t change anything.", "NTA because you have an agreement and don\u2019t seem like you are looking to sell the heirloom off in spite. \n\nI can understand how many families like to keep jewelry in the female line though, some daughters love the idea of wearing grandma\u2019s ring, and as you can see, it helps keep the ring in the family in case of relationships that end. Maybe you can think about giving the ring to your son\u2019s sister when she\u2019s older? Offer to be the caretaker of the heirloom (because I don\u2019t think the new girlfriend should get it, especially if he used the my daughter line on you) and maybe ask your Ex if he has something else to gift his son in exchange? A watch maybe? \n\nAlternatively, you can ask your son if he would like to gift the ring to his sister when everyone is older. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want the ring from my husband\u2019s parents\u2019 broken marriage, but for the new sister it\u2019s her grandmother\u2019s ring.", "That\u2019s exactly what I think is happening too\u2026", "Eh that\u2019s how my family does it. My mom was worried if she gave it to one of my brothers and they ended up divorcing the heirloom would remain with the ex and be lost to our family. If it went to me and my husband I divorced then the ring would just remain mine. Legally, the receiver of an engagement ring is not required to return it in the event of a divorce (depending on the state they might if the marriage never happens.) I\u2019m sure you could potentially craft some prenup language to require the return of the ring, but neither of my brothers would have had the presence of mind to push for that (though one did sign a prenup to protect his business) and she didn\u2019t want to fight about it so she just left it to me. If I don\u2019t have kids it will go to my oldest niece.", "You'd give it to the boyfriend to propose to your daughter with that way it stays in your line. If you give it to your son, he'd give it to his future wife, someone not from your family. That would be my guess", "Not necessarily, a friend gave her grandmother's ring to her son for his wife. They eventually divorced.  She refused to give the ring back. So unless, the son has a prenup that states that she must give the ring back in the event of a divorce, the ring can wind up permanently in the hands of an ex. (not siding with the husband here.)", "I agree. He wants to \u201ckeep it in the family\u201d specifically on his wife\u2019s finger.", "He meant if our son gave it to a woman and they then divorced.", "He probably *did* bring it up, which is why it was legally awarded to the OP in the divorce, otherwise *it wouldn't have been mentioned*.", "He didn't *let her*.  \nIt's *her ring* and it was delineated in the divorce decree, so he's probably already tried to get it back.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s lying. I know him really well and he wouldn\u2019t propose using the same ring. She also wouldn\u2019t want that ring for her engagement ring because she knows it was mine and has seen it.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s lying.

She also wouldn\u2019t want that ring for her engagement ring because she knows it was mine and has seen it.", "There's no evidence he agreed.", "It's mentioned in the divorce, so I'm guessing he asked.", "Their son is.", "Becuase HE and op decided together the ring would go to HIS and OPs son. It will be in his family .", "His father is not estranged. He\u2019s very much involved in his life.", "The father is not estranged though? He is an active co-parent and still very much friendly with OP. It is a sentimental family heirloom that was promised to their son, by mutual agreement of both parents.", "He says it\u2019s a family heirloom. That means there are lots of entanglements associated with it. But they make it more valuable to family, which the so definitely is.", "I think if OP honestly wants their son to have it they\u2019re not being petty. If she doesn\u2019t actually care who gets it then yes that\u2019s petty.", "I think I found the ex\u2026or the girlfriend.", "I'm just evil enough to paste a bright smile on my face, show up with the ring when the new girlfriend is around and say, \"I know we put it in writing that I'm supposed to keep this and pass it on to Son because it's a family heirloom, but I can see things are going really well for the two of you. To show there are no hard feelings, I want to bless your future with this ring I wore so happily. Look, new GF, isn't it gorgeous?\"\n\nThe sooner the better. Because if either one of them is not *quite* there yet, Awkward. And if they *are* ready to commit, unless the heirloom ring is spectacular (or she's a lover of antiques), she may want a new ring.", "That\u2019s exactly why I have my moms engagement ring. My brother both had numerous exes and my mom didn\u2019t trust that the ring wouldn\u2019t be lost in a divorce.", "That's not what I meant with my comment, but you're right. I read OP's post as: it will stay in his (current) family forever if it's passed down to his daughter. A lot of what ifs in both situations, but that's something he needs to discuss with his son when he has the age to decide on such a matter.", "Maybe the son could make a different arrangement than his father did.", "He probably agreed that she would keep it in the divorce judgment, the same way she let him keep other things by agreeing that they would be assigned to him in the property settlement.", "Well that\u2019s good. \n\nBut still\u2026that doesn\u2019t make sense. There\u2019s a higher chance of your son proposing one day (weird to think about right now since he\u2019s so young! Lol) versus his daughter. Also\u2026if the daughter gets it then it won\u2019t stay in the family name.", "Except, you know, the divorce agreement...", "Yes, and that was before he had a daughter. Now he has different thoughts because he has choices he didn\u2019t have before.", "OK so address the rest of my comment. If you can.", "Their son isn't entitled to shit. The very idea is absurd.", "Yeah, because having an opinion you don't like means I'm the ex. \n\nGrow up.", "Thank you for the assist.", "You mean *decree*?\n\nAll OP said was \"in the divorce\".\n\nIf it was in the **agreement** it's very likely his attorney told him he'd never get it so don't bother.\n\nEta: in either case it was approved and finalized by a judge. Judges don't just let shit slide.", "Just to clarify, you\u2019re position is: his reneging on an agreement they made to pass the ring down to their son because he failed to think ahead is not asshole behavior?", "That she has every moral and legal right to the ring, he has neither, and it was mandated in the divorce decree that she keep the ring?", "Neither is the ex\u2019s daughter by that logic. It\u2019s honestly pretty shitty of the ex to change his mind and want to give the ring to his new kid and dismiss the fact it was already promised to his son.", "Actually the fact it was written in the divorce papers is proof enough that the son is in fact entitled to the ring.", "He gave her the ring, and it\u2019s written in their divorce decree that she keeps the ring and then gives it to their son. It\u2019s not about entitlement, it\u2019s about the agreement they already came to about the ring."]}
