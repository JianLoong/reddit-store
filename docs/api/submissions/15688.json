His daughter would get an engagement ring from her future fianc\u00e9. It's just a poor excuse to get the ring for his new girlfriend.", "NTA. With your son it will stay in the family as well and you both agreed on that. It's up to your son, when he is an adult, to decide on this matter.", "NTA. I have a inkling he has intentions on giving it to his new girlfriend down the road and not his daughter. It\u2019s specific in the divorce decree it goes to your son. Now, when said son is 18, if he wants to give it to his dad, it\u2019s in his right to do so. But that would be his decision.", "It sounds like dad is choosing his daughter over his son. How is passing the ring down to the son making it leave the family? Is the son not part of the family now?", "NTA\n\nThis honestly sounds like something that his gf asked for. Why would he put it in the divorce agreement to give to the son and all of a sudden change his mind?\n\nIt makes sense to give it to the son in order for him to use it as an engagement ring when the time comes. Maybe if the son doesn't get married or have kids, but the daughter does, it can be passed down to her. But if his concern is for it to stay in the family, then there shouldn't be an issue with the son having it.", "NTA - that ring is yours by virtue of the legal agreement in your divorce. It's traditional that if the bride breaks the engagement, she returns the ring. However, multiple years of marriage and a child would seem to make that tradition rather moot in this case. That ring is yours to keep and give to your son if you so desire. I hope your ex isn't going to screw up what appears to be an amiable co-parenting situation with this misguided demand.", "Eh, seems pretty cut and dried, NTA", "[deleted]", "NTA as it was agreed upon in the divorce. Was he going to use it as an engagement ring for the new gf?\n\nIf your son doesn't want to use it down the road, he can always gift it to his sister.", "NTA. you fulfilled the obligations of the conditional gift of the engagement ring by entering into the marriage.  \n\nHe would only have grounds to reclaim it if you ended the *engagement*", "NTA. \n\nAn engagement ring is *a gift in anticipation of marriage*. You married him. It's yours.\n\nEdited to add: if you don't still have a lawyer complain to the court that he is harassing you. Idk the process, but it's not legal for him to do this.", "It\u2019s in the divorce agreement and he wants to renegotiate so he can give it to his new partner, I\u2019m guessing. \n\nOf course you\u2019re NTA", "NTA\nIt was agreed upon in the divorce paperwork. Just because he now has a daughter doesn\u2019t magically change a legal document.", "NTA.\n\nI don't doubt that your ex-husband had his reasons for letting you keep the ring, but whatever they were, that's your ring.\n\nIf you want to keep it, or trade it for something else, that's fine, but you have no moral obligation to return it.\n\nWho knows, maybe your daughter will want it as an engagement ring when she's old enough, and maybe you'll want to give it to her.", "NTA. It is your ring. Your divorce decree settled that issue. Your husband now wants it without any consideration.  If it is important to him, appraise it and sell it to him for fair market value. \n\nFrankly, it would be weird for him to propose with the same ring and as a second wife, that would be a hard no for me. But if that is what he wants to do, let him pay you.", "It sounds like he doesn't consider his son part of his family NTA.

The only AH here is your ex.", "That doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026in order for it to stay in the family it would need to go to your son since your son has his last name and would likely be the one to propose to someone.

Not that I know anyone in this story in real life (lol), but I guarantee he\u2019s lying to you. \n\nNTA", "NTA. So he hates his son enough to suggest his son is either not part of the family or won't be getting married? Sounds like he's too much of a coward to admit he wants to give it to his gf--in which case, you'd still be right to decline.", "NTA, your husband should never agreed to let you take the ring via the divorce agreement.  But he did, so that is that.", "NTA. He probably just wants to give it to his new gf. If he potentially wanted to give it to anyone besides your son he should not have agreed to let you have it. He could have kept it and still given it to your son.", "NTA.\n\nIt's pretty customary to give the wedding band back, but honestly unless the engagement ring was *specifically asked for* in the divorce, everyone I know who has gone through it has kept it and done whatever they please with it. \n\nHe should have asked during negotiations; negotiations are over. He can badger til he's blue but it's your ring and your choice.\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA, but I have mixed emotions. The agreement was that it would be passed on to the son. I hope the son has a prenup with his wife that states that the ring must be returned in the event they divorce. I had a friend who passed down a four carat two diamond wedding ring from her grandmother to her son.  The son married and eventually divorced.  The ex-wife refused to return the ring. I think this was what the ex-husband meant. If the ring is passed on to a daughter, even if the daughter divorces, the ring stays in the family.  I am on your side though. You have a legal agreement on your side.", "NTA: he should have never let you have the ring in the divorce. But he did and you are honoring his wish to keep it in the family by eventually giving it to your son. If your son chooses when he is an adult he can decide if he wants his sister to have the ring. \n\nTruthfully be clear with that that in your LEGAL divorce papers, it indicates the ring is yours. You will be giving the ring to your son when he wants to propose. And then tell him that it is the end of the discussion.", "NTA - his son IS \"his family\" and, I presume, he gave it to you so your son will give it to his intended when the time comes. IF, for some reason, your son turns out to be gay or doesn't get married, I can see changing the agreement - but that is a long way away.", "NAH \nHonestly this is such a rough situation. The original agreement sounds like such a lovely solution but I can understand why he would feel the way he does as well... \n\nIf there are multiple gems in the ring, you could consider giving each child one of them and then you two deciding what to do with the rest of the ring. That's a big what if type assumption but both kids get an even share of their ancestry and then you two sound respectful and amicable enough to figure out the rest.\n\nI wish I had better advice. Good luck,  OP. I hope this all works out well for you", "YTA. It is a family heirloom and you are no longer part of the family.", "If it\u2019s being handed down to the biological offspring of yourself and him, then, nope, NAH.\n\nIf the child is yours alone from a former relationship then YAH", "NAH. Yes, you technically get to do it your way since it was set by the divorce agreement. But for what gain? It\u2019s his family\u2019s heirloom. Why shouldn\u2019t he get to decide how it is handed down?", "YTA \n\nI mean seriously why are you so invested in this other family's heirloom? What's the story you're going to tell your son? \"Here, have your estranged father's keepsake to give to the love of your life, make sure she knows it's emotionally entangled in a bunch of bullshit she has no stake in or historical connection to\"?\n\nYou should be cutting those ties, not tying your future generations into the same crap.", "YTA\n\nSuper petty, you're just doing this to be an asshole and nothing you can say could convince me otherwise.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why is this being discussed now??\n\nI wouldn\u2019t argue about it, just say there are a lot of years before either child will need an engagement ring and you can talk about it again in 15 years or so. By then the kids will be old enough to weigh in - could be neither one wants it. At least you\u2019ll know where it is and it\u2019s not being sold or given to the new gf.", "NTA. He can suck it up, it was in the agreement. It\u2019s very strange that he\u2019s backing out of this specific thing.", "NTA the ring is yours until your son is old enough to need it. If he decides later in life that he doesn\u2019t want to gift it to his partner, he can gift it to his child. Just because his dad now has a daughter, that doesn\u2019t change anything.", "NTA because you have an agreement and don\u2019t seem like you are looking to sell the heirloom off in spite. \n\nI can understand how many families like to keep jewelry in the female line though, some daughters love the idea of wearing grandma\u2019s ring, and as you can see, it helps keep the ring in the family in case of relationships that end. Maybe you can think about giving the ring to your son\u2019s sister when she\u2019s older? Offer to be the caretaker of the heirloom (because I don\u2019t think the new girlfriend should get it, especially if he used the my daughter line on you) and maybe ask your Ex if he has something else to gift his son in exchange? A watch maybe? \n\nAlternatively, you can ask your son if he would like to gift the ring to his sister when everyone is older. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want the ring from my husband\u2019s parents\u2019 broken marriage, but for the new sister it\u2019s her grandmother\u2019s ring.", "That\u2019s exactly what I think is happening too\u2026", "Eh that\u2019s how my family does it. My mom was worried if she gave it to one of my brothers and they ended up divorcing the heirloom would remain with the ex and be lost to our family. If it went to me and my husband I divorced then the ring would just remain mine. Legally, the receiver of an engagement ring is not required to return it in the event of a divorce (depending on the state they might if the marriage never happens.) I\u2019m sure you could potentially craft some prenup language to require the return of the ring, but neither of my brothers would have had the presence of mind to push for that (though one did sign a prenup to protect his business) and she didn\u2019t want to fight about it so she just left it to me. If I don\u2019t have kids it will go to my oldest niece.", "You'd give it to the boyfriend to propose to your daughter with that way it stays in your line. If you give it to your son, he'd give it to his future wife, someone not from your family. That would be my guess", "Not necessarily, a friend gave her grandmother's ring to her son for his wife. They eventually divorced.  She refused to give the ring back. So unless, the son has a prenup that states that she must give the ring back in the event of a divorce, the ring can wind up permanently in the hands of an ex.

It will be in his family .", "His father is not estranged. He\u2019s very much involved in his life.", "The father is not estranged though? He is an active co-parent and still very much friendly with OP. It is a sentimental family heirloom that was promised to their son, by mutual agreement of both parents.", "He says it\u2019s a family heirloom. That means there are lots of entanglements associated with it. But they make it more valuable to family, which the so definitely is.", "I think if OP honestly wants their son to have it they\u2019re not being petty.

To show there are no hard feelings, I want to bless your future with this ring I wore so happily. Look, new GF, isn't it gorgeous?\"\n\nThe sooner the better. Because if either one of them is not *quite* there yet, Awkward. And if they *are* ready to commit, unless the heirloom ring is spectacular (or she's a lover of antiques), she may want a new ring.", "That\u2019s exactly why I have my moms engagement ring. My brother both had numerous exes and my mom didn\u2019t trust that the ring wouldn\u2019t be lost in a divorce.", "That's not what I meant with my comment, but you're right. I read OP's post as: it will stay in his (current) family forever if it's passed down to his daughter. A lot of what ifs in both situations, but that's something he needs to discuss with his son when he has the age to decide on such a matter.", "Maybe the son could make a different arrangement than his father did.", "He probably agreed that she would keep it in the divorce judgment, the same way she let him keep other things by agreeing that they would be assigned to him in the property settlement.", "Well that\u2019s good. \n\nBut still\u2026that doesn\u2019t make sense. There\u2019s a higher chance of your son proposing one day (weird to think about right now since he\u2019s so young! Lol) versus his daughter.

Judges don't just let shit slide.", "Just to clarify, you\u2019re position is: his reneging on an agreement they made to pass the ring down to their son because he failed to think ahead is not asshole behavior?", "That she has every moral and legal right to the ring, he has neither, and it was mandated in the divorce decree that she keep the ring?", "Neither is the ex\u2019s daughter by that logic. It\u2019s honestly pretty shitty of the ex to change his mind and want to give the ring to his new kid and dismiss the fact it was already promised to his son.", "Actually the fact it was written in the divorce papers is proof enough that the son is in fact entitled to the ring.", "He gave her the ring, and it\u2019s written in their divorce decree that she keeps the ring and then gives it to their son. It\u2019s not about entitlement, it\u2019s about the agreement they already came to about the ring.", "NTA. Forget everything else, the ring is yours as the wedding happened and if you had wanted to, you could have sold it. As it happens, you agreed to pass it to your son, which you didn't have to do. I think that is enough of a compromise.", "NTA - he signed the agreement. Reply to texts with a photo of his signature on the doc.

Get your own jewel appraiser though.", "NTA\n\nHe wants to propose to his gf with it.", "Daughters are proposed to from men with their own family heirlooms and it only makes sense for sons to have rings like that (i.e why your ex hubby had it lol) he\u2019s lowkey trying to give that ring to his gf", "Yta. It's a family heirloom", "NTA.. but I also think reusing an engagement ring after a divorce is kinda tacky even for the son to use it.", "NTA if you're in fact holding it to give to your son. The ex was very short sighted in not asking for the ring back at that time. He could have very easily given it to your son later in life. His asking for it now is suspicious.", "NTA He doesn't want it for his daughter. Guaranteed that, were you to give it to him, his gf would send up with it. His son is also his family, so I don't see how it wouldn't end up in his family.", "NTA. Your divorce included that clause. No reason to change it for a kid you're not related to. \n\nI thought you were going to say he wanted to give it to his wife.", "ESH.\n\nYou should never have kept it and he should have never let you keep it.\n\nIt's his family heirloom.\n\nDivorce is a difficult time and the two of you made a mistake.  Your the only one trying to make sure it continues though.", "NTA. But if it really was for his daughter why is he asking for it now?? Like she will need it in like 2 decades or more. There could be an agreement that whoever gets married before gets the ring? As compromise i mean, not that you have to do it because you had a previous agreement.", "NTA, both kids are very young.  Let him know that once your son is an adult (18) he can make up his mind if he wants it or his half-sister.  Until then store it in safe deposit box or at your parents' house.  Would not put it past him trying to find it and just take it.  The story is fishy about it for the daughter, it is either for the GF (reset the jewels) or to be pawned.", "NTA", "Apart from it being in.the paperwork, was the ring ever something he talked to you about during the divorce?", "NTA\u2026but it\u2019s his family heirloom and more than likely he wants to give it to his gf, is it really worth creating drama in your peaceful co parenting relationship..\n\nAnd tbh do you want your son to have a ring which basically did not work for you, imo just not worth it but ob it\u2019s your son\u2019s legally.", "NTA. Definitely he wants to reuse it. Your son gets it from you, don\u2019t give it back yo the dad or to your son now, he might give it to his Dad.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he just wants to give the ring to his new partner because his reasoning doesn't make sense. \n\nThe ring would literally still be in the family since it would go to his son. His newborn daughter would receive a ring from her future partner anyway.\n\nThe only other reason that I can think of is that he doesn't consider his son family and does not care for him. But this possibility is highly unlikely.", "NTA \n\nHe wants to give it to his girlfriend but doesn't want to say that. You keep it for your son and hold him to the agreement.", "NTA", "This is your ring to keep and pass on to whoever you like. NTA", "NTA because it\u2019s in your divorce agreement. Your son can decide when he\u2019s older if he wants to keep it or give it to his half sister.", "NTA. it makes more sense for your son to have the heirloom that you (his mother) wore than for his sister who has no connection to you to have it. Your marriage ended but, you are a part of the ring's history now.", "NTA. He is going to ise it on new girlfriend. Stand your ground.", "Nta.

If he wants to pay you for the value of the ring so YOU can put the money away for him to use for college or purchase an engagement ring for his future wife. Then give it to him.\n\nIf he does not agree to doing this. Then keep the ring and your current arrangement.", "This! Is he really telling her that he wants to give his daughter an engagement ring? \n\nNTA. This is an absolutely ridiculous excuse.", "Not only that, it was a gift so she is not required to get it back. I asked my lawyer when I was getting dragged over the coals in my divorce about the $10k ring and he said \u201cforget about that ring, you gave it to her and it\u2019s hers.\u201d\n\nKarma got her though. She would leave it in the sunglasses storage thing in her car all the time, she left it in there and went into a gas station with her car running in the parking spot keys in and unlocked. Car got stolen and recovered weeks later gutted in the desert. So the loan specified in the divorce agreement was paid off by insurance so I didn\u2019t have to pay for her car anymore and she didn\u2019t get to keep the ring. Small victories.", "How is this a terrible situation? It\u2019s crystal clear. The ring belongs to the OP. He gave it to her, so it belongs to her. In the divorce agreement, which he signed, she stated that the property she owns will be passed on to the son. Most of us learned the \u201cNo Backsies\u201d rule by first grade, but apparently the ex missed school that day.", "And it\u2019s staying in the family through her son, she is just the primary holder until he is old enough to take possession of the ring.", "Could be worse.\n\nHe may view his GF and new daughter as his core family while seeing his ex and son as his former family.\n\nLet\u2019s hope he is only just enough of an asshole to want to give it to his new GF though.\n\nNTA.", "But isn\u2019t the boyfriend supposed to get his own engagement ring for the girl he wants to marry? I might not be familiar with all the traditions.", "You\u2019re gonna really confess to grand theft auto on reddit like that?", "Legally, depending on jurisdiction but generally most, heirloom rings are protected. They aren\u2019t treated like regular engagement rings and the legal expectation is they return to the family of origin.\n\nAs is described here, this is a perfect example. OP has temporary custody of the ring for her son, the next in line for the family of origin.\n\nSo they should have been able to sue for the ring, in your example, if they had so desired. Obviously the law isn\u2019t perfect and does often require retainer money. But in theory, there was a legal remedy to be sought.", "Then they could have a prenup written saying in the event of a divorce, the ring goes back to your son, boom easy.", "Clearly that won\u2019t happen. Given that DID happen with you and him divorcing and there was a legal remedy to keep the ring in the family of origin.\n\nObviously not perfect but in this case you\u2019ve given a perfect example of how this can be remedied. \n\nHe\u2019s making strawman arguments to get the ring back. Don\u2019t buy it. You\u2019re doing great.\n\nEngagement ring law is fraught and its even more complicated with heirlooms but you\u2019re doing everything right.\n\nAnd also: Maybe he shouldn\u2019t ever have possession because he has a history of getting divorced! Wouldn\u2019t want the ring to leave the family\u2026 you know GF will safeguard the ring for her infant child.", "That\u2019s a kinda mean assumption about his son\u2019s future, isn\u2019t it?\n\n\u201cWhy bother giving you that nice heirloom, you\u2019ll get divorced anyway!\u201d /s", "He could have the stones reset or exchange it for a totally different ring.", "Yeah, but why else would he want the ring back right now when his daughter is an infant? Why would he be so insistent that it happen now and not in 20 years? \n\nHe\u2019s hounding you about it for a reason. I just don\u2019t think his daughter is that reason. \n\nNTA, but it\u2019s naive of you not to recognize why he\u2019s being so adamant. He could be planning to have the stone reset or he could simply sell it so he can buy her a new one. He\u2019s also being vague about what he plans to leave your son instead. The whole thing seems kinda suspicious.", "You\u2026 I like you", "I was deployed when it happened.

You\u2019re really gonna confess to insurance fraud on reddit like that?", "\u201cOur divorce wasn\u2019t messy. No one cheated and we agreed on everything when we divorced\u201d\n\nStop trying to paint a different picture than what op told us.", "I no longer had the ring insured.
