My fiance's family are nice but they can't help throwing comments at me about how I \"might be\" a \"Gold Digger\". For example, if he buys me something they'll go \"oh Jason bought you that? You know what this looks like right?\" And/or \"Wait, Jason paid for this? Only gold diggers make their partners pay for stuff all the time, *just sayin'*.... It's so demeaning and my fiance does nothing to stop it. Especially now that he's in a bad place in life after he lost his job. And since he's keeping it secret then, I'm the one paying for everything. This has been going on for 4 months.\n\n\n\nLast week, His parents invited us for dinner and he insisted that we go so we went. At dinner table his mom grabbed my hand (literally while I was eating!!) And looked at my bracelet and went \"Oh, this bracelet looks really nice, did Jason pay for it?\" I nodded and reminded her that he bought it for me as a birthday gift last year. She was like \"hmmmm, wonder how much it costs.....\" she then leaned back and said \"You know I remember when my brother was dating this gold digger woman...she'd recieve expensive stuff like this (pointing at the bracelet) bracelet here for her birthdays....\" I was stunned, I cut her off and asked if she meant to say that I was a Gold Digger. She threw her hands up and went \"I mean...if the shoe fits....\" while laughing awkwardly. Silence took over. I looked at my fiance and he shook his head at me like \"what?!?!?!\" I snapped!! . I told her it was bold of her to imply I was a Gold Digger when I'm literally providing for her unemployed son, have been for 4 months now. They all looked shocked. She glanced at me in shock and his dad asked if it was true and my fiance just froze but looked so angry. An argument ensued and dinner was cut short and we had to leave after they started berating him.\n\n\nHe had a rage fit in the car just yelling and lashing at me. In my defense, I said that he sat by and let his mom continuelly imply that I was a Gold Digger but he said that they never outright called me a Gold Digger so it was all in my head. He said I still had no right to take advantage of his \"unfortunate circumstance\" to get back at his mom and expose him to the family. His parents went on about how disappointed they were and now as a result, he got disinvited from Thanksgiving. He blew up at me because of it this morning and kept saying I screwed him over so badly when he was just an innocent bystander.", "created_utc": 1668424799, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yuwayr/aita_for_telling_my_fiances_family_that_hes/", "score": 6815, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My fiance's family are nice but they can't help throwing comments at me about how I \"might be\" a \"Gold Digger\". For example, if he buys me something they'll go \"oh Jason bought you that? You know what this looks like right?\" And/or \"Wait, Jason paid for this? Only gold diggers make their partners pay for stuff all the time, *just sayin'*.... It's so demeaning and my fiance does nothing to stop it. Especially now that he's in a bad place in life after he lost his job. And since he's keeping it secret then, I'm the one paying for everything. This has been going on for 4 months.\n\n\n\nLast week, His parents invited us for dinner and he insisted that we go so we went. At dinner table his mom grabbed my hand (literally while I was eating!!) And looked at my bracelet and went \"Oh, this bracelet looks really nice, did Jason pay for it?\" I nodded and reminded her that he bought it for me as a birthday gift last year. She was like \"hmmmm, wonder how much it costs.....\" she then leaned back and said \"You know I remember when my brother was dating this gold digger woman...she'd recieve expensive stuff like this (pointing at the bracelet) bracelet here for her birthdays....\" I was stunned, I cut her off and asked if she meant to say that I was a Gold Digger. She threw her hands up and went \"I mean...if the shoe fits....\" while laughing awkwardly. Silence took over. I looked at my fiance and he shook his head at me like \"what?!?!?!\" I snapped!! . I told her it was bold of her to imply I was a Gold Digger when I'm literally providing for her unemployed son, have been for 4 months now. They all looked shocked. She glanced at me in shock and his dad asked if it was true and my fiance just froze but looked so angry. An argument ensued and dinner was cut short and we had to leave after they started berating him.\n\n\nHe had a rage fit in the car just yelling and lashing at me. In my defense, I said that he sat by and let his mom continuelly imply that I was a Gold Digger but he said that they never outright called me a Gold Digger so it was all in my head. He said I still had no right to take advantage of his \"unfortunate circumstance\" to get back at his mom and expose him to the family. His parents went on about how disappointed they were and now as a result, he got disinvited from Thanksgiving. He blew up at me because of it this morning and kept saying I screwed him over so badly when he was just an innocent bystander.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He was able to secure passage back to what is now Cape Cod after two years, and when he returned he found his entire tribe dead from disease, probably smallpox. \n\nSo he joined up with Massasoit, the leader of a neighboring Wampanoag tribe, sent him on an intelligence gathering mission to the camp that had recently been set up by some pilgrims. \n\nSo he waltzed into their camp and introduced himself, in English, as the \u201cwrath of god\u201d", "Note that the retracted invitation might be for the deception rather than the unemployment, *per se*", "> future inheritance\n\nMakes me think we need a different term for \"grave digger\" blended with \"gold digger\" and ends with \"if the shovel fits\".", "\"Passive aggression is a form of aggression?

Either way everyone but OP is the only person here NTA. Everyone else is.\n\nEdited NAH to NTA due to a brain fart.", "Yeah, OP is only NTA here in this case. \n\nBeing disappointed because son lost his job four months ago and hasn't found a new one yet, is ridiculous (sure, I can accept being disappointed that he lied about it, but not for the actually lack of job).\n\nMaking (in)direct \"jokes\" that OP is a gold-digger is highly unseemly as well! Fiance not defending his partner is double so inappropriate. Berating OP because she finally snapped, triples it all!\n\nOP should definitely reconsider wanting to join this family or not. With SO and family-in-law like this, who needs enemies!", "Seriously, you can see where the son gets his insecurities and values from.  Not saying the son isn't being an AH here, but this could seriously become a liberating moment for him.  He's probably never stood up to his parents his whole life, nor ever seen anyone else stand up to them.  His response right now is instinctual.  He's been taught to value his reputation above everything else his whole life.  His ego is tied to it.  It's a HUGE blow to admit his shortcomings, and he's not emotionally equipped to handle it.  \n\nSounds like a huge project for OP... No idea what good things their relationship is founded upon, so only she can know if it'll be worth it or not.  At the very least, I would not want to marry this until this crap gets figured out.", "Her marriage will be miserable and probably a pre-nup will have to be signed anyway. So really, not one single upside to this story", "LOL", "I mean, his parents berate him and then he's still begging to go to Thanksgiving...  he clearly thought OP would love him more after getting yelled at...  it's how his own family works.", "It\u2019s just one more meal she has to provide for him!\n\nGravy digger.", "Yup, it sucks being raised to fear how your family will react to things, like losing a job, but he\u2019s an adult now and it is his responsibility to work on how he acts/reacts.", "Oh the pilgrims did that too, make no mistake.", "Maybe. But they were angry with *him* when she told the truth and his reaction made it clear that it was the truth. They didn't call her a liar and tru to turn it around on her. I think it came from him, to boost himself in his family's estimation. I.e., he's just as successful as the rest of them--except he isn't.", "Isn't that just a grave robber?", "What an elegant way to call someone a shithead, I love it", "Or for making a scene at the table when she outed him as unemployed?  Sounds like he threw a tantrum at dinner (argument ensued).  NTA at OP", "N A H is \"no assholes here.\" You're looking for N T A, \"not the asshole.\"", "Oh yeah. I had an ex like this whose mother hated me. Low-key racist, very judgemental about my family and lack of wealth, but it's not like *her* part time teaching job paid for the luxury house, private schools for all three kids and bankrolling 1k a month each for fun money when they attended uni.", "That could totally happen. A former coworker found out her husband of less than 3 months was cheating on her just before Christmas. She went to his mom (mom still got his cell phone bill, wife was looking for detailed billing info to verify some things), and mom told the whole family what had been discovered & that the newlyweds were likely splitting up.

I feel like it's a leap to assume he is calling her a gold digger, but I do see your point about some parts pointing that way.  I'd just rather blame him for what we know he's doing wrong.  He's TA (as are the family) for their known behavior alone.", "I wonder if they really have so much money, then.\n\nI remember The Corpse Bride and the line \"They could be land-rich bankrupt aristocracy, without a penny to their names.\"\n\nA Lady Barkis is what will come their way.", "\"back-stabby fuckery\" - definitely putting that in the vocabulary notebook for later use!", "Yeah, exactly, if your parents don't know how to be supportive, you distance yourself from them, not spend every second you can with them...\n\nwhich is why it makes me think the fiance thought he'd be getting a fat check from his parents at some point over the holidays, and was expecting to use it to pay off debts, or live on for awhile, and is worried them knowing he's unemployed will put that money at risk...\n\nnot that that makes his behavior right.  If he had shut down the gold-digger references when they started he wouldn't be in this situation, and screaming at and gaslighting OP after the dinner was completely unacceptable.   But it's clear that he cares more about his parent's money than OP's happiness, because this all looks like him groveling for whatever shred of affection or money they're willing to toss him.\n\nIt's deeply pathetic.", "I wonder what he told his parents, all this time, behind OP's back.  \nWhich picture has he painted about OP, without OP knowing?  \nI'm almost certain he did fuel the \"she's with me for the money\" idea...", "You\u2019re right.

Like the State farm commercial with the guy holding a fishing rod with a dollar on the end. OPs fiance is an entitled AH, but his parents suuuuuck. I hope he becomes an ex fiance.", "I wonder what happened before he and OP got together. Did he leech off them or other people? Did they kick him out when he was too lazy to get a job and didn't want to change for the better? Did he invest all his savings in a venture that failed miserably? I have so many questions about this family dynamic, but in every one if them the gold digger remarks are rude are best and the fianc\u00e9 carries a huge red flag.", "Oh English is dumb as hell, but I still value proper spelling.

I haven't met many really rich people, but they usually aren't soooo defensive  and protective of their few jewels and Chinese porcelain jars.
