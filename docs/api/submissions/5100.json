In April of this year I found out my sister and husband had been sleeping together for at least three months. I ended my marriage to him, and am in the process of getting a divorce. I also stopped helping out my sister, which I had done since she had her daughter. I told her I never wanted to see her again and to not ask me for help. Our parents are both disabled and live together in a nursing home. They were upset when they heard what happened but told me they would not cut out one daughter for the other. I told them I understood and would never ask them to, but they needed to understand I will not be there for my sister anymore, and I don't care how bad her life gets, or whether she needs some life saving blood or kidney from me one day. They told me they understood.\n\nBut now that Christmas is approaching, there is a big deal being made out of the fact I am not welcoming her and her daughter for Christmas like I normally do. I always bought my niece gifts and gave them someplace to go for Christmas and now I am not opening my new home to them. My parents told me how it would be for my niece, not my sister. I told them being there for my niece means having contact with my sister and that I do not want to see her again.\n\nMy sister begged and pleaded with me to let them come. She has apologized multiple times for what she did. But I do not care. I have never cared. She was getting SO much from me and then she goes behind my back like that. She disrespected me. She made a fool out of me. She allowed my ex to disrespect me and put me in danger (because we were still having sex while he was having sex with her). This is not me saying she is only to blame. But my ex will soon be completely cut from my life. And I want the same to be true for my sister. My sister sent me messages saying her daughter misses me, etc. How she'll be heartbroken if it's just them for Christmas, with almost no gifts. I told her that was her problem to fix, not mine.\n\nMy sister and parents are all saying I am being cold hearted to the wrong person.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Just before I forget, I am planning to change my number seeing as she still contacts me despite blocking her and unfriending her on all social media accounts.", "created_utc": 1671439131, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpm9dn/aita_for_refusing_to_allow_my_sister_and_her/", "score": 2460, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think OP is handling this with a massive amount of grace.

A girl in my high school was obsessed with glitter and was an absolute nightmare to deal with so teachers would let her use glitter for school projects that no reasonable person would ever require art supplies for. I don't even want to think about how many hours I spent trying to rid myself of that wretched STD of the arts and crafts world because my clothes would always be covered in it. ...And I never even had any classes with her.\n\nSo yes, I'd grab all the loose glitter I could find. Would pair splendidly with that slime, I'm sure. Especially if they have carpets.", "Or just plastic baggies of glitter. That don't seal very well.", ">\u201dSTD of the arts and crafts world\u201d\n\nThis is 100% accurate as well as hilarious. Thank you! XD", "dump the glitter ON the drum and it's like a sparkle party lol"]}
