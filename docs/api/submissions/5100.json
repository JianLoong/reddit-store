In April of this year I found out my sister and husband had been sleeping together for at least three months. I ended my marriage to him, and am in the process of getting a divorce. I also stopped helping out my sister, which I had done since she had her daughter. I told her I never wanted to see her again and to not ask me for help. Our parents are both disabled and live together in a nursing home. They were upset when they heard what happened but told me they would not cut out one daughter for the other. I told them I understood and would never ask them to, but they needed to understand I will not be there for my sister anymore, and I don't care how bad her life gets, or whether she needs some life saving blood or kidney from me one day. They told me they understood.\n\nBut now that Christmas is approaching, there is a big deal being made out of the fact I am not welcoming her and her daughter for Christmas like I normally do. I always bought my niece gifts and gave them someplace to go for Christmas and now I am not opening my new home to them. My parents told me how it would be for my niece, not my sister. I told them being there for my niece means having contact with my sister and that I do not want to see her again.\n\nMy sister begged and pleaded with me to let them come. She has apologized multiple times for what she did. But I do not care. I have never cared. She was getting SO much from me and then she goes behind my back like that. She disrespected me. She made a fool out of me. She allowed my ex to disrespect me and put me in danger (because we were still having sex while he was having sex with her). This is not me saying she is only to blame. But my ex will soon be completely cut from my life. And I want the same to be true for my sister. My sister sent me messages saying her daughter misses me, etc. How she'll be heartbroken if it's just them for Christmas, with almost no gifts. I told her that was her problem to fix, not mine.\n\nMy sister and parents are all saying I am being cold hearted to the wrong person.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Just before I forget, I am planning to change my number seeing as she still contacts me despite blocking her and unfriending her on all social media accounts.", "created_utc": 1671439131, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpm9dn/aita_for_refusing_to_allow_my_sister_and_her/", "score": 341, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which means, sorry but the child is collateral damage \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "it's the AH sister that's using her own daughter as a weapon. a pawn to try to get forgiveness from OP.\n\nOP is NTA here at all, but the sister was and, by her attempt at manipulation, still is.", "It seems more like op is preventing the daughter being weaponized against her which, considering how her sister is behaving, is likely.", "If anyone's weaponising the niece, it's the cheating sister that was trying to pass her STDs onto OP.\n\nIf she were actually a good parent, she'd try to mitigate the awful hurt she's given her daughter, instead of leading her on and letting her feelings get even more hurt.\n\nInstead, she's just an awful parent that's letting their kid be hurt and grow up with a witless cheater as a role model. Yuck!", "Thank you for mentioning this, that didn't even register in my brain when I read it.\n\nThe entire situation is horrible. But she only just found out about this affair months ago, and they're already guilting and manipulating her to just act like nothing happened? \n\nStarting to think maybe there's some golden child syndrome going on with the sister, or perhaps she's just an entitled brat who has been enabled by her parents all her life. And then using her daughter as a pawn?! She's the absolute worst. \n\nI hope she spends Christmas with people who are supporting her through this rough time and avoids her family like the plague.", "Exactly.  Don\u2019t let sister cross the threshold! \n\nThere is no way to have a relationship with the niece. Sister would use that to manipulate her way back in. OP just needs a clean slate.  \n\nNTA", "I agree. OP's parents have chosen a side, the sister's. Which is super sad. Stay strong OP - you are NTA and I admire your strength.", "Exactly! I can understand not wanting to cut their other daughter out of their life, especially with a grandchild. But trying to force OP to let her sister back into her life is absolutely choosing a side.\n\nIf I were in OP's shoes I'd feel the same way. I'd understand not cutting her out completely, though I'd expect them to be outraged by her actions, but this guilt and manipulation nonsense? That would absolutely make me reconsider my relationship with my parents.", "Yeah, so sick of people excusing and dismissing atrocious, unforgivable actions because \"but it's family.\" And an affair...With her husband...That lasted months...Dear God, that is just....\n\nI'm with you on that. As soon as my parents stopped respecting my boundaries and tried to force a relationship with the sister who had an affair with my husband I'd be moving across the country and blocking them everywhere until I was ready to even consider whether or not it was worth trying to repair the relationship with my parents.", "No, because they told her they understood that she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with her sister but now are mad how she\u2019s setting boundaries because it will \u201caffect her niece\u201d. That\u2019s not understanding, that\u2019s taking sides. \n\nI get that they don\u2019t want to cut off their other daughter, personally I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to cut my child off no matter what they did. \n\nBut I see a bit of preference, they know that having her sister and niece there for Christmas will hurt op\u2019s feelings, they don\u2019t really care tho. That\u2019s messed up.", "In such a case, the option of \"choosing no side\" is actually to choose a side. The parents choose the sister's side, asking OP to forgive and do everything like holiday and family stuff like before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe parents should be protecting OP, not sister from the consequences of her actions.", "They call OP cold hearted instead of giving her sister a verbal ass whooping.", "If they don\u2019t want to choose sides (which to the hurt party is always going to feel like taking sides anyway), the very least they can do if they want to be neutral is not join a boundary stomping pile on. \n\nWhen you choose to help one party to stomp the boundaries of another, especially when it\u2019s the guilty party stomping the boundaries of the hurt party, that is ABSOLUTELY choosing sides.", "Hard disagree. If you love someone you can't stay neutral. Being neutral in this situation is making a choice.\n\nHer sister made a choice to ruin her siblings life. If her parents can just get over that, and then try to manipulate OP into just moving on like nothing happened then they are also the assholes. \n\nThey are prioritizing one child's happiness over the other's because the happiness of both children is now at odds with each other.", "As sad as this is it's so very true. My sister was very close to my daughter watched her from, 12weeks to 2years old. My sister went awol when my daughter was about 5 and now she is 8...she doesn't ask about her anymore.  But I also don't keep the memories alive.", "It may not be happening in the future but it's only been a few months so she hasn't been forgotten at all this year.", "Why though?", "Yeah, it's kinda difficult to have a relationship with a 5 year old without contact with their parent/guardian.\n\nAnd that sentence certainly didn't sound as creepy as it may read", "That is why I said maybe she could, but if she doesn't want to, she doesn't have to.", "I totally understand that. Do what is best for you right now. What is happening with niece is sad, but not your responsibility.   \nMaybe you have it in you to send niece a card and a gift on special occasions and keep contact at a distance that way until niece is old enough to have a relationship that doesn't involve her mother.", "Not golden child. Just she has the grandchild. And my parents love their granddaughter more than anything in the world so they will always hope she will get the best of everything, including me in her life.", "You will end up hurting yourself more if you allow your sister back into your life.\n\nSucks for your niece but that\u2019s the consequences of her mothers actions im afraid. You can explain to her when she\u2019s 18 if she comes asking. \n\nKeep both your sister and soon to be ex husband out of your life. Keep your peace and keep your self respect. \nNTA", "If you're close with your niece, you could always try to spend time with her away from her mother (like she could drop them off at your parents and you could visit). \n\nBut either way, it's your decision. And your parents need to respect your boundaries, or it's time to get some space. You have far enough to deal with right now."]}
