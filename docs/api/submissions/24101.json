She was the maid of honor. Brittany has told me several times about her cocaine usage, and I know when she\u2019s high as it makes her more (verbally) aggressive.

It\u2019s valid for someone to not want to be around a drug user with a small child. Also I doubt she \u2018rarely\u2019 uses if it\u2019s been something that\u2019s been going on for years and it\u2019s obviously not in control if she\u2019s sending aggressive texts whilst using it and doing it more than once. Also the aggressive response you got back from her is typical of drug addicts in denial whilst confronted with their behaviour.", "NTA \n\nDid she ever actually deny that she was high when she sent those texts? You never accused Brittany of bringing drugs around children, all you did was tell Lauren what experiences you had with her drug use.", "NTA. The truth should come out one way or another. Hiding something means you know it\u2019s wrong. I found my mom\u2019s cocaine in her purse once when I was a kid. I think it\u2019s a rational fear. Cocaine is highly addictive, I\u2019ve tried it visiting friends in Florida a few times. I wouldn\u2019t believe that if it was a years long habit for her that it\u2019s \u201crarely used\u201d now. She is allowed to be mad you made a very reasonable assumption. I\u2019m sure there were children at the wedding she did coke at. That\u2019s some serious behavior..\n\nI\u2019ve \u201ctold\u201d on some of my friends who were doing hard drugs. It ruined our friendship.

My mom set a hard boundary with my grandfather (alcoholic) that if he was or had been drinking he couldn't be around the kids. I was a bit sad when I was a kid because I didn't get to see him very much growing up, but the times I did he was sober. My grandfather knew it was his own decisions that kept us from him. \n\nBrittany may one day recognize that as well, but that is up to her, not you.

NTA.", "If she\u2019s having drugs with her and doing drugs in an unlocked room at someone\u2019s wedding, and has drugs in her handbag *when she was the designated driver*, then she\u2019s probably going to have drugs in her purse when she arrives to babysit as well.

I have never heard anybody use party as a verb without some kind of mind-altering substance being implicit.\n\nAnyway........I'm probably to say NTA.  It's not like you made an explicit effort to go tattle, and you say Brittany brags about her coke usage, so it's not like it's secret.  I'm almost tempted to go n-a-h except that if Brittany brags about her usage, doesn't want Lauren to know, and never explicitly asked anybody to not tell Lauren, then she's kind of an AH for getting mad at you.\n\nAlso, this tracks very well with my experience with coke users.  They are mostly normal, but they go aggressively off the rails way too quickly.  Nowadays I tend to avoid them.", "NTA - and what was she texted Lauren about the gift from her dad?  When ever I see drug users and money in the same sentence . . .", "NTA. Brittany is addicted, all right. Lauren is right to not want her child around Brittany, and you need to protect your future child the same way. People who are addicts are a danger to everyone around them. It doesn't matter what substance they're addicted to.", "Wanted to second the part about her \u201crarely\u201d using anymore.  That was a bold faced lie.  I\u2019ve known more than my fair share of addicts in my life, and those that have quit own up to their past usage/addiction and more somberly acknowledge their history when confronted about it.  The post above mine 100% speaks the truth."]}
