Considering the significant loss of income, I asked the home owner if my offer could be withdrawn. I also talked to my real estate agent. Essentially, I signed \\*\\*JUST\\*\\* enough paperwork for them to sue me (for a lot) if I backed out, and the owner expressed that he would 100% pursue that route if I backed out of the contract.\n\nSo, whatever. I'm stuck with this house now, it's fine. That was an important back story but not the point.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, I went to view the house and while there, the owner mentioned that he is almost done chemo, his last treatment would be on the 30th so that is when they would officially be leaving to their new home. However, legally, the house is mine to do what I would like with on the 20th. The owner asked if he could please stay in the home until the 30th so that he can stay here and finish treatment. I still have my current house until the end of the month, so I was fine with that. I told him that would be fine.\n\nI DID mentioned that I would like to start moving my stuff in a few days before the 20th, so I can have a little extra wiggle room to complete the move. I figure, you know, I'm giving them ten extra days, I'm sure they wouldn't mind me moving some small things into the home since almost all of their stuff is out of it by now anyway. The basement is completely empty which is where I was going to put everything while they were still there so it would not be in their way. I also didn't plan on moving in huge pieces of furniture or what not, just a few boxes and things now and then so that I don't have to rush as much. They did not object to any of this.\n\nI texted them today and asked if it'd be okay if I stopped by and dropped off two boxes. The homeowners wife replied and said \"No. My husband is not feeling well because of the chemo.\" So I said \"okay, well, when would be a good day for me to start moving some of my easier stuff in?\" And she again said \"My husband is not feeling well. You can start moving things in on the 20th. Thanks.\"\n\nHUH? Maybe I'm crazy, but that seems extremely bizarre considering I'm doing them a huge favor, and also that I absolutely would not be a disturbance to her husband. I feel like she just does not want me in her house yet, but I don't know why she would take this route, considering I also don't have to let them stay there any longer.\n\nWhich brings me to my question: Would I be the asshole if I told them that our agreement was that I could move stuff in early, and they could stay an extra 10 days, and I would move in on the 30th- and so if they are not going to uphold their side of the agreement, I will not allow them to stay in my house for those additional ten days?", "created_utc": 1700091578, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17w7n09/wibta_if_i_kicked_someone_out_of_my_home_one_who/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s fine I will be moving in on the 20th and I expect nobody and nothing to presently be in the house at my day of arrival per contract.

As your agreement to pre store stuff has fallen through.  Best get your lawyer to advise them officially rather than personal contact.", "NTA.  How in the world did they close the sale if they hadn't vacated the property?  At this point, you have somebody living in your home that you have no legal agreement with.  Financially, that's incredibly stupid.  Either get a lease agreement from them, or toss them out.  Those are the two options.", "OP go straight back to your realtor, which is who made their money off of you selling the property, an advise you on the situation and to explain what your legal options are IMMEDIATELY.

You're being extremely understanding and accommodating by giving them an extra 10 days to stay in your house.

I would think that this would have been arranged at the closing and all agreements signed at that time?    You need a 10 day rental agreement with them to protect you.

Not fun.)", "This should be handled as part of the closing and you shouldn't be finding out last minute. They should be paying you rent for the ten days they are staying past the closing.

Asking them to leave on 20 won't make you an AH, but letting them stay will make you a better person.", "NTA. Frankly, when they said they would pursue legal action if you tried to back out of the contract, you have EVERY right to enforce it to the letter.\n\nI wouldn't even give them the 10 extra days.

Yeah, I get it on their end, it's not their problem, but they can't then ask for favors.\n\nTell them to be out by the 20th now, no exception, or they'll be held in breach of contract and you'll sue them.

Talk to your Realtor/Agent/Loan Officer!", "NTA - if you are in the US (not sure about other countries) then a rent back would have been included in the contract that said part of the closing agreement was that they were going to rent the house back for 10 days after the closing.

However, that being said, maybe just let this one go, it seems like his wife is gonna need that money so that\u2019s why they threatened the lawsuit. I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you kicked them out at 20th, I think if he said he would pursue legal recourse I would get back at him in this regard.

Remind her you\u2019re the one who\u2019s doing the favor.", "Kick them out today as you legally own the house, or charge them rent of at least your mortgage payment. Your planned move date is irrelevant- it is your property NOW. If they damage the house you are screwed. If they injure themselves on your property you are screwed. If someone wants occupancy beyond the closing date, a formal rental agreement and payment of rent, including a security deposit, is a requirement. I needed to stay one week past closing on a prior house, this is how it was handled.", "Honestly I would not allow them to stay.\nWhat if they get injured in the house after it is legally yours?", "The house is yours as soon as the closing date. Tell them to move. Never let the previous owner stay past the legal transfer. I did this and it took weeks to get rid of him.", "Why do people threaten to sue, then ask for favors? Don't shit where you sleep.", "NTA but I\u2019m really curious, why did your wife want a divorce immediately? Lol Did you buy the house without her?  I was caught off guard when you said partner when she was your wife, no biggie but yeah very curious why she divorced you so fast?", "I may be down voted here, but YTA in this situation.  You do not take possession of the house until the 20th.  That means you legally do not have access to the house until the 20th.  I think you are being very generous allowing them to stay until the 30th, and you seem like a nice person.  You did not have to do that.    However, based on the facts you listed, you have no right to the house at this point in time.  They are in the clear in saying no to your request.", "Hmmmm there\u2019s a bunch of possibilities here. I don\u2019t think either of you are the ahole in this case. Do you know if he\u2019s terminal ? Do you know how sick he is after his treatments? They picked the 20th because he wanted to finish treatment in his house. If he\u2019s terminal or even just reflecting on life it would be very difficult for them to leave the house and it would hold a lot of memories. If he gets very sick after treatment it\u2019s very understandable that he doesn\u2019t want anyone in the house. I know you wouldn\u2019t be a disturbance but maybe to him it would be something he\u2019s uncomfortable with.

Umm no sir kick them out on the date stated !!!! Because it\u2019s inconvenient for you to move your stuff in when it\u2019s legally yours?

You are doing the a favor. It\u2019s not a trade. So you should not ask for something in return. Ofc after the 20th the house is yours so even if it makes them uncomfortable you are free to do whatever. It would not be altruistic but it would at least be legitimate. Yet before the 20th forcing anything on them would be immoral.\n\nYou could frame it as a request but if they don\u2019t want to it\u2019s their choice.

Moral in society made so that happy people carry the biggest weights for everyone while sad people deal with their personal problem. It\u2019s likely because dealing with problems when already dealing with problems is harder than when being fine.\n\nI don\u2019t know if being mad at sad people being toxic for no reason is legitimate.

Your ethics are not dependent on other people\u2019s behavior.", "Yes, you would be. \nCancer is a bastard and the treatment is poison that saves you. The side effects of chemo can and do vary from treatment to treatment. You don't know what's going on, how stressful it is for him and his wife, or how sick he is post treatment.

They're screwing with you and completely taking the piss. Without a leaseback agreement you don't have any guarantees they're going to end tenancy when they say. Take possession now, and tell your real estate agent he's a complete moron for not looking out for you by taking care of this detail.", "Exactly this. I had to change my move out date when coordinating a move between houses. I had to pay $4,000 to the new buyers to get an extra 30 Days in the home I had sold. All of this was in writing and arranged by our realtors.", "^ This is the answer.", "You are charging them rent for those extra ten days right?  Please tell me you are charging rent. They would have a right to keep you out if you are charging but then it\u2019s fair", ">The basement is completely empty which is where I was going to put everything while they were still there so it would not be in their way. I also didn't plan on moving in huge pieces of furniture or what not, just a few boxes and things now and then so that I don't have to rush as much. They did not object to any of this.\n\nSounds like you were trying to Extend Grace to them, given their situation with chemo, and quietly doing a slow move-in by putting stuff in the basement until their official move out? And they agreed to this?\n\nIf so, NTA. It's your house now.\n\nBut just in case it all flips...you probably needed a written rather than a verbal agreement detailing the move out/move in, especially considering the health issues of the current tenant. \n\nI do admit that I'm slightly confused by OP's post / timeline due to the way it is written, so perfectly fine to ignore my input! I just hope it works out for both parties without too much aaarrrgggh.", "They should be out already if it\u2019s legally yours. You need to contact your agent and read your purchase agreement.", "They need to be out now since you own it. I'm betting they plan to squat and didn't buy a different place.", "You need to ask your realtor and closing attorney. You need legal advice, not am I TA. If you haven\u2019t closed or signed a legally binding contract already I would tell them to be out at closing.", "I'm always reminded of the saying 'no good deed goes unpunished'\n\nI'm sorry they're behaving like this but if there's no written agreement for them to be out by the 30th (and paying you rent for those 10 days) get your lawyer to remind them they need to be gone by the 19th if you have possession on the 20th.\n\neta: I assume they agreed the completion date and they would've known when he treatment would end etc.  My spider sense really does tell me to either make the completion date the 30th or for them to be gone by the 20th.", "When we bought or house we actually had a written agreement where the previous owner moved out past our ownership date but had to pay x days of mortgage for the extra days they stayed in, so they could finalize their new mortgage and move. In the future, that is likely the better path to go.", "Because the world doesn't work that way.  It would be nice if that type of karma happened, but the world is not fair.  Being a good person means doing kind things for others without expecting something in return.  When you start expecting payback, generosity becomes a business transaction.", "I understand where you are coming from. I guess my thing is like\u2026 me and these people, we\u2019re both doing a nice thing for one another, yeah?\nThe nice thing that they agreed to is supposed to be happening now until the 20th.\nThe nice thing that I agreed to is happening from the 20th-30th.\nSo it\u2019s not as much about karma for me as it is just getting the ick from these people that are trying to withdraw their end of the deal and still expecting me to keep mine. Is that the kind of person that I want to spend my time, money, resources, etc on in acts of kindness?", "lmao, the world does indeed work that way. do you live somewhere rent free? most adults pay either rent or a mortgage, commensurate with the amount of time they inhabit the dwelling. OP is giving these people 10 days rent-free, and he's asking for something in return which is totally appropriate. it IS a business transaction, with a little grace extended because the OP is being a good guy. it's not his responsibility to balance out the world's generosity and prevent it all from becoming a business transaction. in this case, that's inherently what it is.", "Bc he\u2019s deathly ill. Chemo makes you incredibly sick. They asked for that grace bc of that. You were nice enough to agree. If he just had a chemo appt that day everything makes you sick, including noise and strangers moving stuff in. They know they can\u2019t do anything about that after the 20th, but he\u2019ll almost be finished his treatments as well"]}
