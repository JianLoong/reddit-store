I\u2019ve only been in SS\u2019s with 5-7 people at work.) We have rerolled 5 times, because we\u2019ve either a) changed the rules after getting our recipient or b) added people. We started with 10, decided to add spouses, then kids (??) and now random family friends. \n\nOur current rules are ridiculous, IMO. We were told to put affordable gifts \u201cthat a kid can buy,\u201d but everyone is putting their expensive life wishes on the list. Then, we have to get at least 5 gifts from the wishlist, with no budget, and you have to declare how many gifts you are giving in the group chat to make sure you receive the same amount\u2026 which makes no sense. You also need to add where your gifts can be found. A few people have also started saying that they are going to buy from lists other than their recipient\u2019s. \n\nOn top of that, everyone keeps editing their lists, adding and removing things that they think of. I\u2019ve explained how inconvenient this is becoming, and even tried the angle of the financial burden being placed on the parents (of multiple kids, there\u2019s 6 kids total in the group). Most of the group agrees, but are explaining that they are \u201cgritting their teeth for family\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nThe list I got today after a month of back and forth (I\u2019ve been asking since this seems to be a serious project at this point), is riddled with luxury name brand items like Dior and Louis Vuitton that I know no one in the group can afford.. maybe two people can buy one of these items. And that\u2019s a strong maybe. Nothing on the list can be found for less than $200. And I checked. \n\nDid I mention that we are not allowed to deviate from the list unless explicitly stated that we can? Yeah. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t feel like the essence of gift giving, or even Secret Santa. There\u2019s so many rules, no element of surprise. At this point, we are just giving each other items to unwrap. I\u2019m one of three who followed the rules, and no one edited their list when this was brought up.

Other people probably are thinking the same thing.", "Double down on that and make it a White Elephant (aka Yankee Swap, aka Dirty Santa)", "yeah, i come from a family of 6, everyone is married now and there are 5 kids so far. our rules are if you\u2019re under 18 you get a gift from everyone and if you\u2019re 18+ we do either secret santa or white elephant with a limit of $50-75 depending on what everyone agrees to. sometimes we will do a like/dislike list if requested but we don\u2019t give a wishlist", "Love the way you think!", "And the kids don\u2019t participate until they\u2019re adults, making parents buy gifts on behalf of their kids is ridiculous. My nephew has 6 kids under 18, no way my family would expect them to spend 8x more than his single sister.", "I'm probably one Christmas away from pulling out of the Secret Santa at my husband's friend's group Christmas. The husbands are extremely tight knit, so when they get each other they BLOW the reasonable budget of $30 USD and it becomes a circle jerk of how well they know each other because it's never from their wish list anyway. If they draw someone else's wife or the wives draw each other, wow! We can suddenly stay in budget?!\n\nI have a couple of other wives finally sick of it. My husband doesn't want to deal with my rage so he sticks to the budget. I'm over it. Told my husband this year it could be my last year. I won't go if something doesn't change.", "DIOR! \ud83e\udd23", "Angry upvote", "Dammit, why did awards go away???", "Family white elephants especially with adult children are the true memory makers.", "One of our cousins brought up this exact point to the group chat. None of these rules make any sense. Unfortunately, the \u201cconductor\u201d thinks everything is fine here. We\u2019ve been accused of ruining Christmas over this skepticism haha.", "The list I got includes luxury handbags, a PS5, baccarat rouge with a specification of **NO DUPES**, Dyson air wrap, naked cashmere robe, a plane ticket to Bali.. to name a few. The cheapest is a green Amazon kindle which is $203 with tax.", "We do a tacky gift exchange for the adults.  $15 limit and from a thrift store. It\u2019s fun!", "I would withdraw on behalf of your spouse/partner and kids. Tell them family you\u2019ll be taking the money you budgeted and donating to Red Cross or whatever you support. \n\nEnjoy your holiday!", "Oh man, your family sucks ass. One of the first rules set is always budget so its ridiculous you guys have redone rules and added people so many times and never set a budget.  You gotta tell us who is asking for luxury brand shit.", "If you back out I am willing to bet others will follow. It sounds like this has really snowballed out of control and I'm sure you're not the only one who is no longer comfortable participating, others probably want to back out but don't want to be the first to rock the boat. \n\nAs an aside, this is so not the point of Secret Santa! All the ones I've ever participated in have a limit no higher than $50 and it's meant to be just a bit of casual fun, whereas the expensive, high-end gifts come from your partner or immediate family. This just feels incredibly greedy.", "Buy a $25 Louis Vitton gift card $25 Apple gift card and 3 food gift cards totaling $50", "Just get 5 pairs of socks.. what are they gonna do? Cry?", "Pull out. That's crazy! I don't know anybody who does a secret Santa without at least a general idea of how much should be spent.\n\nAnd FFS. I love my family members, but I'm not sending $200+ on one of them for Christmas. Life is too expensive for that kind of ridiculousness.", "So what...Let them call you cheap. It's doesn't matter op. Why not you using the money for family that dearest to you. To sum it up, people who always grateful eventho you giving 10 dollars or even food voucher.don't let this so called family  taking advantages on you. They just wanted someone to fulfill their wishlist because they know they can't afford some dior and LV using their own money. So they need others to do for them.", "Yes! That rule has to be key to a successful Secret Santa. Preferably both a minimum and a maximum budget, so everyone's somewhere around the same ballpark.\n\nWhen a group of friends and I did this, we agreed that the budget should be a minimum of \u00a35 and a maximum of \u00a310. (I think? I can't remember the exact amount, but it was enough that you could find something fun and thoughtful for your giftee with care - or a semi-decent box of chocolates! - but not enough to have major expectations or disappointments invested in your gift.)", "Unless there's multiple gift cycles.\nAs in: A -> B -> C -> A, and D -> E -> F -> D.\n\nBut yeah, the whole thing sounds stupid indeed.", "I think you hit the nail on the head with that last line!\n\nNTA", "Yes this is just plain reasonable. We also have this and you get one person and we have a set budget up to $50 and kids aren't in the mix, cause parents and grandparents give them presents. It works for us wonderfully.", "We do the same, but the kids also get to get in on a kid draw. They like to pick something for another. And they get lots of gifts from the grown-ups. We do, however get a little wild on stocking stuffers. They can be a lot of fun. My ex-MIL fills up the stockings with all kinds of little items: both practical & crazy. So, everyone has a fun-filled stocking, too.", "XD that\u2019s hilarious, and kinda similar to something my parents would do if they weren\u2019t able to get an item in time. They\u2019d put the picture in a fancy box with an estimated time of arrival.", "Does this mean you aren't buying me the Dior purse I wanted along with the Hermes scarf?  How rude!  /s", "NTA I would bow out.", "That\u2019s exactly what it is. Some members of my family have decided that they want (?) to buy from other lists\u2026 voluntarily yet still secretly.", "Normally, yes.", "Time to edit your own list to send out. I'm sure Paris is nice in the spring, and don't you need a new car? When they call you out just say you're doing what they did, so what's the issue?", "yeah, we have a 'one big gift' and \u20ac5-10 little gifts for the others rule.", "Losers always take advantage of these things. I refuse to do them at all anymore. If I want to gift someone, I will gift them. Beyond that, nah.", "That sounds like it was either a poorly executed white elephant exchange, or the person who gave you soup sure thought it was.", "You\u2019re close. The person spearheading the crazy rules does indeed have luxury items but not nearly as much as my recipient. I would love to post some lists but I\u2019ve already said way too much at this point haha.", "bet \ud83d\udc4c", "We do this because it was getting to be a headache to search, buy and wrap everything. Now, we have a budget; a wish list that can you choose to buy from or not, and we only get one name per person. The grandchildren get individual gifts.", "Oh gosh yes. Ridiculous. Adult secret Santa\u2019s are fun for big families so instead of having to buy 20 gifts, you buy one little gift and that should be it! This should not be used to pay for children\u2019s gifts, that is the parents responsibility, you have the kids that\u2019s your job to buy them gifts too.", "NTA, then. If people are breaking the agreed upon rules and the person in charge of enforcing them won't step in you are justified in taking your ball and going home. You signed up for one thing and they are trying to make you do something different.", "Oh dear, reminds me of a \"tacky gift exchange\" office party (among the women in our department) I was invited to some 30 years ago. Ten dollar limit and \"the funnier the better!\" were the two rules. Well, apparently my idea of \"funny\" was different from everyone else in the office....I'm not making this up - I'd say 75% of the gifts were bags of potpourri and/or potpourri burners. The humorous part (apparently)? \"It smells sooo bad!\" \"The burner is some ceramic thing I bought at Goodwill!\" I was dreading the moment when my recipient opened her gift...a Fleet enema and a can of 2000 Flushes toilet bowl cleaner. I guess the moral of the story is don't go shopping for wacky gifts after you've had several cocktails with a friend who has a similarly warped sense of humor. (For those who've read this far the gift I received was an oversized pin/brooch with a light-up Rudolph nose. Hey, it was never specified \"Christmas-themed Tacky\"...!)", "We do a different theme every year, but same idea. $15 gift according to the theme, then we play different games to win or steal a gift. Tons of fun!", "That sounds like tons of fun!", "We used to do similar at my in laws. As outrageous and funny as possible. It was so fun.", "Great idea. This gift exchange has turned into a conspicuous consumption parade", "We quit doing gift exchange on both sides many years ago. We use the cash we would have spent on a different local cause each year. Anything from blessing boxes to gifts for a nursing home resident without family.", "With no budget one bag egg spoils the batch. I\u2019m not spending $1k on someone when my list has five items that total $50.", "Hahaha! Here they are \ud83d\udc5c\ud83e\udde3\ud83d\ude09", "how do they know that person's SS isn't buying that item, they'll end up with two (or more)?", "This is insanity", "They are all buying from your list.", "How do they even have the other people's list? Wouldn't their list be given only to their ss? This whole thing is wildly wrong", "And who can live without a 59\u2019 Fleming?", "Oh man. Please?! I want to know!", "If they say you're a bad person for withdrawing and you won't get a gift (!! shocking) just tell them you'll choose from your own wish list and treat yourself, and pretend it's a surprise.", "lol. At least your gift was useful (in case of constipation and a dirty toilet haha)", "We have a similar tradition at work, but this is this \"gift bingo\", so everybody brings some cheap, funny gift, puts it secretly in the room, so nobody know who brought what.   \nThan we play bingo, so winner of each tour can choose their gift. When all the gifts are gone, we play a few rounds more, to \"steal\" the gifts from each other.   \n\n\nI've had one funny situation during this play, also.   \nThe day of the play (it's always the last day before Christmas holiday, we work then only to the lunch time and then there is some sweets and play together).  \nMy friend from work approached me, asking, if I maybe have some gift paper, because he forgot about the play and bought his gift on the way to work.   \nAs I remembered, but have had no time to do it, I've had the paper and my two gifts.   \nTwo, because my SO was also working in this company then. So I asked the friend, if he, packing his gift, could also be so nice and wrap ours. I know, against the rules, but the day was quite hectic and I really had no time to do it.   \n\n\nFast forward - my SO won one tour of the bingo and could choose his gift.   \nSo he did it.  \n And, of course, he chose our own gifts.   \nTwo, because the friend wrapped them together, not separately.", "That's AMAZING-- you brought an enema to an office party?! I love it-- it goes past inappropriate all the way back to appropriate lol.\n\nWhen I do exchanges like this, I usually get a 24-pack of pop. It's huge and heavy, and no one knows what it is until they open it.", "This is hilarious. I would have peed my pants laughing.", "Ouch! For what it\u2019s worth, the other gifts were not jokes and barely even statements. \u201cPotpourri exists\u201d is the extent of their \u2018humor\u2019. Yours was the only one that was actually any kind of funny", "I once got a child\u2019s toilet trainer lid. ( it goes underneath the standard lid so your kid doesn\u2019t fall down the hole when trying to balance and poo at the same time ). \n\nThey had written around the edge \u201c the perfect picture frame for a complete arsehole\u201d.   I hung it in my cubicle for years !!", "I would have found the gift you gave hilarious \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "But did anyone laugh at the gift you brought? We had a family used book exchange one year. I brought an old copy of a diagnostic mental health manual that lists all the requirements for various mental health issues. The eventual recipient didn\u2019t find it funny.", "LOL - reminds me of when I got the Turd Twister for a friend's husband. Although, he loved it. \n\nFor those uninitiated, the Turd Twister is kind of a like a Play Dough extrusion set, but supposedly for your rectum, so you can extrude your poop into fun shapes (obs just a joke item).", "At the last one I gave picked pigs feet and an industrial size can of chocolate pudding and received a gift card to a local video store (yes I'm old)\n\nEdit: I accidentally a word", "That is hilarious!", "We do dirty Santa. One gift and the recipient is kind of random. It usually works well but for the time my youngest niece got the yeti cup I brought and my older brother stole it. It was the most valuable gift, though it didn't cost me anything. I thought that was pretty shitty.", "Once in high a school a friend told me to \"be creative\" and \"no rules\".\n\nGirl our church youth group would bring pregnancy tests, the largest women's underwear they could find, and there was a \"no raw eggs or litterbox contents\" rule.\n\nI bring condoms unless told to not bring condoms. \ud83d\ude05", "we do steals as well!", "Love it!!!", "I don't even understand how it works! I'm so damn lost!", "Sounds like everyone\u2019s list is being shared in a group chat so that everyone can find the list of the person they are buying for.", "We have hosted this style of Bingo with several different groups before and it is lots of fun. We always bring some extra bags and without the participants knowing we add items from people's desk or home. For example: the boss's 80s glamour portrait of his wife, someone's purse, or favorite coffee mug.", "I would have found that hilarious, but then again, I work in health care...", "I was excited until I got to word extrusion (a life of severe constipation makes strange things a joy). Now I\u2019m imagining poop hearts and stars in the toilet\u2026"]}
