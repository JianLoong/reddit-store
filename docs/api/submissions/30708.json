I\u2019ve mostly spoken to them over the back fence but the parents have also brought their kids over to play with my dog a few times.\n\nThe kids have always seemed like typical kids with my dog, running around chasing each other or throwing the ball, just mutually wearing each other out, and my dog has always been good with kids, he\u2019s careful, tolerated kids pulling his ears/tail or climbing on him until me or their parent could stop them, and is careful not to bowl them over even though he\u2019s a big boy (German Shepherd). \n\nThe mum brought the kids over to play with my dog last weekend and while they were running around, she said my dog would be a good therapy dog. I asked what made her say that and she said because of how he is with her eldest son. I must have looked confused because she said \u201cYou do realise (son) is autistic, right?\u201d\n\nI said no, I had no idea and she got kind of defensive I guess? She said he\u2019s non-verbal and asked how I hadn\u2019t noticed and I said I\u2019d only really spoken to her and her husband, I\u2019ve barely spoken to their daughter and thought her son was just shy around new people so he hadn\u2019t talked to me. She said she couldn\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t noticed and called her kids over to take them home. It was getting dark so I just wrote it off as a weird interaction and thought nothing more of it.\n\nI saw the dad in his yard when I got home from work yesterday and asked if he wanted to bring the kids over on the weekend. He said probably not the best idea after last weekend. I asked why and he said his wife is still kind of pissed off that I didn\u2019t realise their son is autistic. I asked him to apologise to her and if he was also upset about it. He said he isn\u2019t, he thinks his wife is just sensitive about it because their son\u2019s autism is such a huge aspect of their lives and she can\u2019t see how someone can\u2019t recognise it even if they have no experience with autistic children.\n\nI grabbed a small hamper (gift basket) on my way home from work today and a card saying sorry which I left on their front porch (they weren\u2019t home).

What a strange hill to die on and why on earth would she choose to isolate her son from someone he enjoys over it.\n\nMy son is 18 and there are still neighbors who have no idea he\u2019s autistic.

Just...wow. As someone who is around autistic kids the fact that he was able to interact with a complete stranger and feel at ease is amazing! What kind of twisted parent gets mad that someone - who is essentially a stranger - doesn't realize their child is autistic as if that should be the only discerning characteristic of their child? The fact that you treated him like a 'regular' child and didn't differentiate between him and his sister should have been something she was thankful for. Non-verbal children, and severely autistic children are often treated different, as if they're not 'normal' and it always (in my opinion) does more harm than good. I am just baffled that she got mad that you treated her son like any other kid. Like what in the actual hell.", "NTA - she wants your dog as a Therapy dog for her kid.", "NTA, what would even be the benefit of you noticing? What difference does it make? You allowed kids to play with your dog and everyone was happy. It seems even better that a child with special needs is not so \"obvious\" and can interact normally. She seems cray.", "NtA the woman is mad In two senses.", "NTA some Kids are just beeing shy. My best Friends daughter which i know since the day she was Born is so shy around me that she neither Talks to me or Looks at me. She has No problems with her Mom or her friends but she needs a Lot of time to get used to them.\n\nIt's Kind of rude to think 'oh the Boy didn't Talk to me there Mist be Something wrong with him' -> that's were i would get angry \n\nEveryone is different and that's good!!", "NTA. What an odd reason to be upset", "NTA but I would suggest you leave it alone , no need to extend apologies or courtesies or next thing you know she will guilt trip you into giving up your dog \u201c good as therapy dog\u201d to redeem your unforgivable mistake.\n\nShe seems like she built an entire identity around being a mother to an autistic child and you unrecognizing this has set her off . Whatever the reason behind her reaction, you are better off as unreasonable people are not fun to deal with .", "NTA and I already dislike her as a person.  That's honestly gross to be outing your kid like that.  AUTISM WARRIOR MOMMIES are just the worst and they generally don't do their kids any favors. They inevitably infantize their kid, give them whatever they want, and constantly excuse their behavior and dismiss any criticism.   When I decided to find some online autistic support groups, I ran into groups full of adults who were just JERKS whose mothers sheltered them from everything. \n\nAt first I didn't realize she was talking about a 10 year old?   Who is fine with the neighborhood kids, who doesn't need any accommodations for play, lady back off.  There is ZERO reason to be bringing this up.\n\nAlso HOLD-UP!  Did she straight up imply that you should give her your dog???  That's also an asshole thing to bring up.", "NTA. And it\u2019s super weird that the mom got so upset. I\u2019ve live down the road from a boy the same age as my son for 10 years. He has said MAYBE three words to me in ten years. He\u2019s not autistic or nonverbal, he\u2019s just incredibly shy. I think it would be weird to assume that a kid you barely know was autistic based on the fact that he didn\u2019t talk to you, an adult.", "NTA\n\nWhat an odd reaction. It\u2019s not like you overstepped any boundaries or started treating the kid differently when you found out he was autistic. \n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong here, and gone out of your way to apologise even though you had nothing to apologise for in the first place.", "NTA. You were kind to the kids, and didn't judge them. Even if you had experience with kids in the spectrum, it would have been impolite to assume anything.  \n\n\nThe mother is going to realize this soon. I think the husband understands your position.", "NTA. If she felt it was important for you to know her son was autistic, she should have made it a point to tell you. She shouldn\u2019t expect you to diagnose a child with autism if you aren\u2019t qualified to do so. What if you had assumed her son was autistic and he actually wasn\u2019t? She would probably be equally upset.", "NTA. Honestly, I feel a little bad for the kid. It sounds like his mom has made his autism his defining feature in her eyes. She should be relieved to have others see him as just another kid instead of that kid with autism.", "NTA why should you notice if her kid is \"special\" or not? It's not like it really impacts your life so who cares one way or the other. THe mom needs to get over herself the world doesnt revolve around her son", "Nta\n\n\nIm autistic. \n\nEven I don't recognize other autistic people  as autistic unless told they are.", "NTA Boggles my mind why the mother thinks others are at fault here. She wants others to know her son is autistic? Tell them. I'm also struggling to understand why OP even had to apologise (with a gift!!). Interaction could have been just \"Ah ok, didn't realise. Now I know!\"", "NTA. It's weird; i have absolutely no clue what it is like to live with a non-verbal autistic kid, but it doesn't seem like something to be angry about, actually the opposite. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA, how were you meant to know when they didn't tell you? Like you said, you thought he was just a shy kid who likes your dog. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Seems like a major overreaction from his mum. It's not like you said anything judgemental or nasty. She needs to calm down.", "NTA, the husband summed it up perfectly. You are good neighbor for giving them a gift.", "NTA. The mother was out of line. How were you supposed to know the son wasn't just shy? Lots of kids take a long time to warm up to adults. And imagine he didn't have autism and you asked her if he did have it.", "NTA. You are not psychic and labeling children without previous knowledge of a condition is not at all ok. Imagine if he wasn't autistic and you asked if he was, that would be so offensive. Having said all that, if this kid connects with your dog, I'd try to fix this situation. No it isn't your responsibility, but your dog may be able to really help this kid in a way no one else can. I don't think you should pass that up and you may well end up with new best friends. If you are inclined, read up on autism and how dogs can help and see what your pup can do.", "NTA -- if you had noticed odd behaviour and asked the neighbor if her son was autistic, she would have been equally offended.", "NTA - rather the opposite. I'd skip the gift basket and rather ask if the two kids could help you out with the dog sometimes. Hopefully she'll get over it and realise that will be good for them, especially the autistic kid. I'd ask both though, if the kids seem to be good friends. That way he doesn't get singled out, he probably gets enough of that at home.\n\nPoor kid with a mother like that. And I can just imagine her meeting other parents, like someone with NT kids that are just shy or not interested in talking to her: \"Oh, is your kid autistic too? So is mine, and it is soooo hard\". \"Uhm, excuse me???\"\n\nNever try to diagnose other people unless it is your job to do so is a good rule in general. Mother's the AH.", "NTA, parents TA. Not everyone who doesn't speak or can't is autistic.", "NTA. The fuck she want? Everyone to point at her child and scream \u201cautism\u201d If she requires the recognition that badly then put a orange helmet on the kid with pin on his shirt that lists his pronouns and his developmental disabilities. FFS \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m autistic and you won\u2019t notice unless you live with me.", "NTA and the wife is REALLY weird for being so offended by this. It's totally fine you didn't notice? You were never shitty to the kid. \n\nThe fact she puts such emphasis on it and seems to revolve their lives around it is what's weird/worrying. The husband seems to kind of realize. Eesh.", "I'm not sure what to do. This is the first time in a long time where OP literally does nothing wrong. Wow! It's so weird for your neighbors to be upset though. NTA", "NTA. I was around 50 when someone recognized the symptoms of autism in me. You can't be expected to make an untrained diagnosis based on casual contact with a playing kid.", "Wut? No, you're NTA.\n\nYou didn't insult her son in any way. To the contrary, you treated him just like you would any other kid because you didn't even know otherwise.\n\nDid you say anything other than \"No, I didn't notice\" that could be interpreted as gauche? Something seems missing here.\n\nTheir son's diagnosis probably does take up a huge aspect of their lives... But that doesn't have any transfer to you or your life. I wouldn't have left a gift basket because it's kind of like admission of guilt or saying something wrong. She's going to feel even more justified in her strange reaction when she gets it.", "NTA. I have no idea why you treating their kids like anybody else would be offensive. That woman is screwy.", "NTA and every normal parent would be happy that their kid progressed to the point where his issues are not obvious. I'd stay away from this crazy woman.", "NTA.  I have a feeling she's one of those mom's that makes \"my kid is neurodivergent\" her whole damn personality", "NTA. The mom is being way over sensitive. She\u2019s pissed that you didn\u2019t notice. She\u2019d have been more pissed if you had noticed and said something about it.", "NTA.\nThis is weird behaviour from the mom and indicates that she enjoys conflict. I have an autistic child. Some people notice, some people don\u2019t. My kid is just a kid and I don\u2019t expect people to know what autism looks like. Ridiculous.", "NTA \n\nYou have nothing to apologize for, she is the problem", "NTA you did nothing wrong", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry but the wife is blowing this way out of proportion. You were kind of shitty for enabling her behavior by leaving an \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have issues\u201d basket. I get that you have to live next to them but you should STOP letting them play with your dog. This woman is not completely balanced and you are setting yourself up to be a complete doormat of a neighbor. One sideways injury from your dog and she\u2019ll be going to the cops looking to have your dog destroyed.\n\nDo not put yourself in further danger of liability.", "NTA\n\nIn fact had you assumed he was she would have been offended because you assumed he was.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, even her husbands think so, stop acting like you did.", "This is VERY weird, NTA.", "NTA, you treated him like a regular kid and didn't treat him different or like an outcast. Sure she is sensitive, but \"educating\" people that way isn't the best approach.", "NTA. Neighbour wife is an odd duck for taking this sooooo personally\u2026it\u2019s like she got mad at you for not noticing she was a mom who had an autistic son not that her son is autistic.", "NTA. It looks like Mom is angry not for the child's sake but because you don't recognize her as a poor suffering mother of an autistic child", "NTA absolutely not you did nothing wrong, in fact, you treated the kids as if you would\u2019ve treated anyone else. You were kind, thoughtful and didn\u2019t discriminate against anyone.\n\nThis is some internalized issue with the mother, and it\u2019s not on you. She sounds like the type of mother who pride herself in the fact that she has an autistic son, and she should be regarded as special for being a mother with an autistic son. \n\nShe give off narcissistic tendencies, but really I shouldn\u2019t be judging this harshly. Regardless, you have are not to blame, I don\u2019t even think she deserves a basket, but you were very thoughtful to do so.", "In (67m) am HFA-ASD. We are considered the world's best actors and can fool anyone.   \n\n\nA non-verbal child, that you have no interaction with? A lot of behaviour, except for the non-verbal, would be normal to your eyes. She did not tell you what you needed to know, how is that your fault? You have no need to apologize for something you were never told.   \n\n\n0% chance an untrained eye would have known.  \n\n\nSounds like she has a lot of guilt and is projecting it. Go with what the husband said, he gets it.", "NTA. \n\nI have a son, 8, with special needs, and I would never be upset if someone didn\u2019t notice, lol\u2026\n\nI know we are all just doing what we can to get by, and I try my hardest not to pass judgment on other people- especially other special needs parents- but this is kinda\u2026 extra. \n\nVery nice of you to apologize to the husband and leave a gift. I hope she gets over this and gets back to normal.", "NTA. Her reaction is... honestly, not very healthy.\n\nIt's not like you were berating him for not speaking or for not looking you in the eye or something.", "Lmao NTA- I misread the title at first and thought you were diagnosing this lady\u2019s son \ud83d\ude02", "NTA - most parents who have been putting in big efforts with autistic children would be pleased and proud to see that their efforts are \\*working\\* because their autistic child just seems like an ordinarily shy kid.  \n\n\nUnless, of course, they want lots of extra sympathy and allowance made for them so they can take advantage of others' generosity by using their kid's autism diagnosis as  leverage.", "NTA - Honestly, I\u2019d stop talking with this woman. She sounds like she would start expecting you to basically let them have your dog for \u201ctherapy\u201d purposes, guilt-trip you into babysitting the kids, just otherwise cause a bunch of drama. \n\nWe call them \u201cautism warrior parents\u201d, and they\u2019re just super unpleasant to be around, not even touching on the subject of how they talk about and treat their autistic kids.", "NTA. I felt like talking bc I remember how I was being a kid with autism. Literally... Theres no straight forward way to tell the difference between an autistic child vs a normal if theyre as high functioning as you mention. Mute is as high functioning as I got most the time(even now). Might be lost in his own world doing his thing.", "Absolutely nta. You actually did the best thing possible which was treat the kids as normal kids. If her sons autism was such an important thing to the mom it is on the mother to bring it to your attention. \n\nFor the record autism isn't always that obvious, it took 32 nearly 33 years for mine to be diagnosed bc of how it presented. \n\nThank you for being such a good neighbor your dog deserves a steak for being such a good doggo", "NTA\n\nHis mother is going to realize someday that the entire world does not revolve around her and her family.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA - The dad was absolutely right, and it sounds like a situation he has had to deal with before. You've gone out of your way to make amends, which is very kind of you. It is just up to her to get over it.", "NTA. That\u2019s such a weird reaction?? People usually get mad if someone asks if their kid is autistic. Why is she so mad that you just thought he was quiet?", "NTA. Im going to get on my soapbox for a minute because I care a lot about this. \n\nI\u2019m friends with several adults with autism, and married to one. The biggest threat to people with autism is parents like that mom, who make their child\u2019s autism an integral part of their identity as a parent. Any chance at real parenting goes out the window, because they view absolutely everything through the lens of their kid\u2019s diagnosis.  Instead of being glad that you were treating her son like a normal kid, she got mad that you hadn\u2019t recognized him as different. She is reenforcing to him that he is different from others. It stunts his ability to grow and learn, by giving him an excuse to never try. So many of my friends who were raised like that, came into adulthood with zero practical skills, and no coping mechanisms for dealing with the real world. Their lives were harder not because of their autism, but because their parents had used that autism as an excuse to not teach them anything.", "Mom was upset that you, who are not a mental health professional, did not properly diagnose her non-verbal child who was playing with your non-verbal dog.

I remember being taken to people's houses around that age. Told to go play in the yard. While parents visited with the adult. And it's normal for kids to be shy and not talk to old people.  Cuz you know anyone older than the kid.\n\nI want to specify that I understand you didn't say her child \"didn't look autistic\"\n\nBut what I'm guessing is it triggered that trauma she has experienced\nIt can be super triggering, for a parent of a kiddo with ASD, to be told, their kiddo doesn't look or meet the visual representation of autistic.  But I want to give context as to why it is so.\n\nBecause ASD can be an invisible disability.  Like and you wouldn't believe the amount of times people tell you, I'm not joking. Literally tell you to your face \" He doesn't look autistic!\" Or \"But he looks so smart!\" Or some variation.\n\nNow imagine you're trying to seek services, specialist, doctors, whatever, and that is literally how people treat you.

This hair cut REALLY covers it up.\"\n\nIf her kiddos that impacted, ASD it does like likely a huge impact on the family.\n\nEspecially limited non-verbal.  I mean imagine. Adults, kids, take advantage of it all the effing time.  Imagine your child not being able to tell you that their caregivers at school are abusing them.

My son is autistic and he is verbal but his ADHD masks a lot of his autistic traits when you first meet him. \n\nIf you have limited actual time with her son then how would you know. It\u2019s understandable to think he\u2019s shy. \n\nI know it can be hard as an autism parent which is where her reaction came from but that does not make you the asshole here. \n\nThere can be an \u201cother-ness\u201d that happens when someone finds out your child is autistic and what I got from this is her son didn\u2019t experience that from you and I love that for him. \n\nIt\u2019s okay that you didn\u2019t notice that he was autistic.", "I\u2019m so confused. What is the issue?", "NTA. Autism is a spectrum and some kids can mask their symptoms exceptionally well. You might notice they're odd but not be able to pin point why. And well, kids can be odd for a lot of reasons. Social anxiety, depression, ADHD, growing up extremely sheltered and/or being homeschooled. It would be rude to just assume every kid who's reserved or doesn't like to talk or hates loud noise is autistic. \n\nActually a lot of autistics are just now getting diagnosed in there 30s, 40s, even 70s. It went extremely under diagnosed in women, people of color, and poor people. Basically if you weren't a upper class white little boy who constantly stimmed and had melt downs you probably weren't labeled autistic but were instead labeled shy, or ditsy, or the quiet one, or weird, or slow, or delayed,  or bratty, or antisocial, or stubborn, or a homebody or \"lacking in common sense\" or \" booksmart not street smart\" or \"sensitive\" or even, \"gifted\". You know the Eignstein type who couldn't socialize well but skipped several grades.... so if it's taken professionals this long to realize just how prevalent autism is do you really think lay people could point out every autistic person they've ran across in their life? \n\nYou treated the kids equally, without prejudice, which is refreshing in our culture of ableism --even though you noticed the kid doesn't speak much. You didn't go \"what's wrong with you!\".  Many autistics themselves hate being singled out and infantilized as much as they often are. And mom seems to be going out of her way to make sure her kid is always seen as autistic first and a person second. It's the reason a lot of autistic adults can't stand autism speaks and other such groups.", "Autism is literally an invisible disability and a vast spectrum.

That's what this is about. She was making a leading statement and you didn't take the bait. You're NTA but your neighbour likely had a whole speech in place, ending with her appealing to you to make her son's life better by giving them your dog and you ruined it, from her perspective.\n\n\nShe'll now try to use your apology and gift basket to tell you if you're REALLY sorry you'll let them take your dog to live with them. I'd shut down any more play dates with the dog asap and stick with a friendly nod to the neighbours going forward.", "\"WHY DIDN'T YOU ASSUME THINGS ABOUT MY CHILD?! MY CHILD IS OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT!

The kind that is \"fighting the fight\" for their \"autistic warrior\".\n\nUgh.", "Lmaoooo what?? I didn\u2019t even notice my OWN CHILD was autistic until she was 10. NTA at all.", "NTA - she's probably mad because she's an Autism Mom(tm) and it's her entire existence, and how dare you not recognise her suffering and struggles from the few minutes you see her kids in their own back garden or playing with your dog. /S\n\nAutism isn't a birthmark or scar, a lot of us are so good at blending in no one ever knows. I went 30 years before anyone even suggested I should go through the assessment process, and even now only two members of my family know about my diagnosis. \n\nUnless he's unfortunate enough to struggle with the more extreme behaviours/sensory overload etc then he probably does just look like another kid right now - running a bit wild, occasionally pushing boundaries with the dog, shy around strangers... \n\nI don't know my neighbour's medical diagnoses, and it's a bit ridiculous that yours thinks you should. Also she'll do her son no favours if she's forever introducing him as autistic before introducing him as a person.", "NTA\n\nIf fact you did the right thing by treating both kids the same. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am neurodivergent  and I hated it when I was a kid if people pointed out my \"quirks\" and made fun of them (mainly other kids).  As a adult I now know my brain is just works differently and my \"quirks\" now make a lot more sense. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is worth keeping in mind things like Autism/ADHD/Dyslexia are genetic and it is likely one of the parents will have a undiagnosed neurodivergence.", "NTA. \n\nWhen I was kid I was super quiet around most people besides my cousins. A lot of kids can be shy at that age which is why this is super ridiculous of her to think your behavior offensive.  It sounds like she is choosing to make her kid who entire world rather then a facet of her world. She could do with some counseling I think.", "As an autistic dude\n\nNTA\n\nWow that woman is crazy, I mean great that she recognizes her son's autism but wtf??\n\nYou definitely don't need to apologize, if anything: she should apologize for blowing up on you.", "NTA \n\nForget that you don\u2019t know much about autism, she doesn\u2019t know much about therapy dogs! That is not how it works.", "Kind of sounds like she doesn't have a problem with you so much as she potentially has past traumas over the difficulty getting a diagnosis / services, and perhaps feeling gaslighted by people who didn't take her concerns seriously.\n\nSo yeah, she definitely got defensive, and she's not in the \"right\" to get upset at you, but I guess sometimes she needs to set these strict boundaries in order to look out for her own mental health.", "NTA. \n\nAutistic Guy here. You've done nothing wrong. Don't let her get to you. Her life is all about her sons autism, so it can be easy to forget, that other people don't know what you know.
