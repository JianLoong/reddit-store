I\u2019ve mostly spoken to them over the back fence but the parents have also brought their kids over to play with my dog a few times.\n\nThe kids have always seemed like typical kids with my dog, running around chasing each other or throwing the ball, just mutually wearing each other out, and my dog has always been good with kids, he\u2019s careful, tolerated kids pulling his ears/tail or climbing on him until me or their parent could stop them, and is careful not to bowl them over even though he\u2019s a big boy (German Shepherd). \n\nThe mum brought the kids over to play with my dog last weekend and while they were running around, she said my dog would be a good therapy dog. I asked what made her say that and she said because of how he is with her eldest son. I must have looked confused because she said \u201cYou do realise (son) is autistic, right?\u201d\n\nI said no, I had no idea and she got kind of defensive I guess? She said he\u2019s non-verbal and asked how I hadn\u2019t noticed and I said I\u2019d only really spoken to her and her husband, I\u2019ve barely spoken to their daughter and thought her son was just shy around new people so he hadn\u2019t talked to me. She said she couldn\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t noticed and called her kids over to take them home. It was getting dark so I just wrote it off as a weird interaction and thought nothing more of it.\n\nI saw the dad in his yard when I got home from work yesterday and asked if he wanted to bring the kids over on the weekend. He said probably not the best idea after last weekend. I asked why and he said his wife is still kind of pissed off that I didn\u2019t realise their son is autistic. I asked him to apologise to her and if he was also upset about it. He said he isn\u2019t, he thinks his wife is just sensitive about it because their son\u2019s autism is such a huge aspect of their lives and she can\u2019t see how someone can\u2019t recognise it even if they have no experience with autistic children.\n\nI grabbed a small hamper (gift basket) on my way home from work today and a card saying sorry which I left on their front porch (they weren\u2019t home). I\u2019m feeling shitty for not noticing such a huge aspect of her life because she\u2019s really nice and we were kind of becoming friends before this.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: so I posted this and went to bed, I didn\u2019t think it would get this much attention! Thanks for all the comments, I appreciate getting everyones perspectives. \n\nFor those asking:\n\n- I did talk to the kids, but the daughter would usually answer for both them. I just assumed she was an outgoing motormouth kid and he was shy because my older sister and I had that dynamic. She\u2019s the motormouth while I was very shy and took a long time to warm up to people so I did the same behaviours as him (not talking, not making eye contact). My parents used to joke that they didn\u2019t have kids, they had a goofy puppy and an aloof kitten.\n\n- The gift basket was small and only $20, I didn\u2019t spend a fortune. I realise now that it was probably over the top but I have to live next to these people and would like to be on good terms with them.\n\n- If the parents ask, I\u2019ll continue to let the kids play with my dog, but I\u2019ll keep an eye on the situation. I\u2019ll admit I may be naive, but I don\u2019t think she was angling for me to give her my dog. The kids and my dog really enjoy playing together and I don\u2019t want to deny them that if I don\u2019t have to.", "created_utc": 1699623183, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17s43cg/aita_for_not_noticing_that_my_neighbours_son_is/", "score": 804, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What a strange hill to die on and why on earth would she choose to isolate her son from someone he enjoys over it.\n\nMy son is 18 and there are still neighbors who have no idea he\u2019s autistic.

Just...wow. As someone who is around autistic kids the fact that he was able to interact with a complete stranger and feel at ease is amazing! What kind of twisted parent gets mad that someone - who is essentially a stranger - doesn't realize their child is autistic as if that should be the only discerning characteristic of their child? The fact that you treated him like a 'regular' child and didn't differentiate between him and his sister should have been something she was thankful for. Non-verbal children, and severely autistic children are often treated different, as if they're not 'normal' and it always (in my opinion) does more harm than good. I am just baffled that she got mad that you treated her son like any other kid. Like what in the actual hell.", "NTA - she wants your dog as a Therapy dog for her kid.", "NTA, what would even be the benefit of you noticing? What difference does it make? You allowed kids to play with your dog and everyone was happy. It seems even better that a child with special needs is not so \"obvious\" and can interact normally. She seems cray.", "NtA the woman is mad In two senses.", "NTA some Kids are just beeing shy. My best Friends daughter which i know since the day she was Born is so shy around me that she neither Talks to me or Looks at me. She has No problems with her Mom or her friends but she needs a Lot of time to get used to them.\n\nIt's Kind of rude to think 'oh the Boy didn't Talk to me there Mist be Something wrong with him' -> that's were i would get angry \n\nEveryone is different and that's good!!", "NTA. What an odd reason to be upset", "NTA but I would suggest you leave it alone , no need to extend apologies or courtesies or next thing you know she will guilt trip you into giving up your dog \u201c good as therapy dog\u201d to redeem your unforgivable mistake.\n\nShe seems like she built an entire identity around being a mother to an autistic child and you unrecognizing this has set her off . Whatever the reason behind her reaction, you are better off as unreasonable people are not fun to deal with .", "NTA and I already dislike her as a person.  That's honestly gross to be outing your kid like that.  AUTISM WARRIOR MOMMIES are just the worst and they generally don't do their kids any favors. They inevitably infantize their kid, give them whatever they want, and constantly excuse their behavior and dismiss any criticism.   When I decided to find some online autistic support groups, I ran into groups full of adults who were just JERKS whose mothers sheltered them from everything. \n\nAt first I didn't realize she was talking about a 10 year old?   Who is fine with the neighborhood kids, who doesn't need any accommodations for play, lady back off.  There is ZERO reason to be bringing this up.\n\nAlso HOLD-UP!  Did she straight up imply that you should give her your dog???  That's also an asshole thing to bring up.", "NTA. And it\u2019s super weird that the mom got so upset. I\u2019ve live down the road from a boy the same age as my son for 10 years. He has said MAYBE three words to me in ten years. He\u2019s not autistic or nonverbal, he\u2019s just incredibly shy. I think it would be weird to assume that a kid you barely know was autistic based on the fact that he didn\u2019t talk to you, an adult.", "NTA\n\nWhat an odd reaction. It\u2019s not like you overstepped any boundaries or started treating the kid differently when you found out he was autistic. \n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong here, and gone out of your way to apologise even though you had nothing to apologise for in the first place.", "NTA. You were kind to the kids, and didn't judge them. Even if you had experience with kids in the spectrum, it would have been impolite to assume anything.  \n\n\nThe mother is going to realize this soon. I think the husband understands your position.", "NTA. If she felt it was important for you to know her son was autistic, she should have made it a point to tell you. She shouldn\u2019t expect you to diagnose a child with autism if you aren\u2019t qualified to do so. What if you had assumed her son was autistic and he actually wasn\u2019t? She would probably be equally upset.", "NTA. Honestly, I feel a little bad for the kid. It sounds like his mom has made his autism his defining feature in her eyes. She should be relieved to have others see him as just another kid instead of that kid with autism.", "NTA why should you notice if her kid is \"special\" or not? It's not like it really impacts your life so who cares one way or the other. THe mom needs to get over herself the world doesnt revolve around her son", "Nta\n\n\nIm autistic. \n\nEven I don't recognize other autistic people  as autistic unless told they are.", "NTA Boggles my mind why the mother thinks others are at fault here. She wants others to know her son is autistic? Tell them. I'm also struggling to understand why OP even had to apologise (with a gift!!). Interaction could have been just \"Ah ok, didn't realise. Now I know!\"", "NTA. It's weird; i have absolutely no clue what it is like to live with a non-verbal autistic kid, but it doesn't seem like something to be angry about, actually the opposite. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA, how were you meant to know when they didn't tell you? Like you said, you thought he was just a shy kid who likes your dog. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Seems like a major overreaction from his mum. It's not like you said anything judgemental or nasty. She needs to calm down.", "NTA, the husband summed it up perfectly. You are good neighbor for giving them a gift.", "NTA. The mother was out of line. How were you supposed to know the son wasn't just shy? Lots of kids take a long time to warm up to adults. And imagine he didn't have autism and you asked her if he did have it.", "NTA. You are not psychic and labeling children without previous knowledge of a condition is not at all ok. Imagine if he wasn't autistic and you asked if he was, that would be so offensive. Having said all that, if this kid connects with your dog, I'd try to fix this situation. No it isn't your responsibility, but your dog may be able to really help this kid in a way no one else can. I don't think you should pass that up and you may well end up with new best friends. If you are inclined, read up on autism and how dogs can help and see what your pup can do.", "NTA -- if you had noticed odd behaviour and asked the neighbor if her son was autistic, she would have been equally offended.", "NTA - rather the opposite. I'd skip the gift basket and rather ask if the two kids could help you out with the dog sometimes. Hopefully she'll get over it and realise that will be good for them, especially the autistic kid. I'd ask both though, if the kids seem to be good friends. That way he doesn't get singled out, he probably gets enough of that at home.\n\nPoor kid with a mother like that. And I can just imagine her meeting other parents, like someone with NT kids that are just shy or not interested in talking to her: \"Oh, is your kid autistic too? So is mine, and it is soooo hard\". \"Uhm, excuse me???\"\n\nNever try to diagnose other people unless it is your job to do so is a good rule in general. Mother's the AH.", "NTA, parents TA. Not everyone who doesn't speak or can't is autistic.", "NTA. The fuck she want? Everyone to point at her child and scream \u201cautism\u201d If she requires the recognition that badly then put a orange helmet on the kid with pin on his shirt that lists his pronouns and his developmental disabilities.

It's totally fine you didn't notice? You were never shitty to the kid. \n\nThe fact she puts such emphasis on it and seems to revolve their lives around it is what's weird/worrying. The husband seems to kind of realize. Eesh.", "I'm not sure what to do. This is the first time in a long time where OP literally does nothing wrong. Wow! It's so weird for your neighbors to be upset though. NTA", "NTA. I was around 50 when someone recognized the symptoms of autism in me. You can't be expected to make an untrained diagnosis based on casual contact with a playing kid.", "Wut? No, you're NTA.\n\nYou didn't insult her son in any way. To the contrary, you treated him just like you would any other kid because you didn't even know otherwise.\n\nDid you say anything other than \"No, I didn't notice\" that could be interpreted as gauche? Something seems missing here.\n\nTheir son's diagnosis probably does take up a huge aspect of their lives... But that doesn't have any transfer to you or your life.

I have no idea why you treating their kids like anybody else would be offensive. That woman is screwy.", "NTA and every normal parent would be happy that their kid progressed to the point where his issues are not obvious. I'd stay away from this crazy woman.", "NTA.  I have a feeling she's one of those mom's that makes \"my kid is neurodivergent\" her whole damn personality", "NTA. The mom is being way over sensitive.

She\u2019d have been more pissed if you had noticed and said something about it.", "NTA.\nThis is weird behaviour from the mom and indicates that she enjoys conflict. I have an autistic child.

Ridiculous.", "NTA \n\nYou have nothing to apologize for, she is the problem", "NTA you did nothing wrong", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry but the wife is blowing this way out of proportion.

You were kind, thoughtful and didn\u2019t discriminate against anyone.\n\nThis is some internalized issue with the mother, and it\u2019s not on you.

I hope she gets over this and gets back to normal.", "NTA.

She sounds like she would start expecting you to basically let them have your dog for \u201ctherapy\u201d purposes, guilt-trip you into babysitting the kids, just otherwise cause a bunch of drama. \n\nWe call them \u201cautism warrior parents\u201d, and they\u2019re just super unpleasant to be around, not even touching on the subject of how they talk about and treat their autistic kids.", "NTA. I felt like talking bc I remember how I was being a kid with autism. Literally... Theres no straight forward way to tell the difference between an autistic child vs a normal if theyre as high functioning as you mention. Mute is as high functioning as I got most the time(even now). Might be lost in his own world doing his thing.", "Absolutely nta. You actually did the best thing possible which was treat the kids as normal kids. If her sons autism was such an important thing to the mom it is on the mother to bring it to your attention. \n\nFor the record autism isn't always that obvious, it took 32 nearly 33 years for mine to be diagnosed bc of how it presented. \n\nThank you for being such a good neighbor your dog deserves a steak for being such a good doggo", "NTA\n\nHis mother is going to realize someday that the entire world does not revolve around her and her family.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA - The dad was absolutely right, and it sounds like a situation he has had to deal with before.

Im going to get on my soapbox for a minute because I care a lot about this. \n\nI\u2019m friends with several adults with autism, and married to one. The biggest threat to people with autism is parents like that mom, who make their child\u2019s autism an integral part of their identity as a parent. Any chance at real parenting goes out the window, because they view absolutely everything through the lens of their kid\u2019s diagnosis.  Instead of being glad that you were treating her son like a normal kid, she got mad that you hadn\u2019t recognized him as different. She is reenforcing to him that he is different from others. It stunts his ability to grow and learn, by giving him an excuse to never try. So many of my friends who were raised like that, came into adulthood with zero practical skills, and no coping mechanisms for dealing with the real world. Their lives were harder not because of their autism, but because their parents had used that autism as an excuse to not teach them anything.", "Mom was upset that you, who are not a mental health professional, did not properly diagnose her non-verbal child who was playing with your non-verbal dog.

Literally tell you to your face \" He doesn't look autistic!\" Or \"But he looks so smart!\" Or some variation.\n\nNow imagine you're trying to seek services, specialist, doctors, whatever, and that is literally how people treat you.  Imagine you are accessing disability services with a child who visually appears to have no issues at all.  People do confront, judge and make comments.  Or worse.\n\nLike it's so much a thing that parents will have jokes, literal jokes for when it happens.\n\nLike \" Thanks! That's how I style the hair. This hair cut REALLY covers it up.\"\n\nIf her kiddos that impacted, ASD it does like likely a huge impact on the family.\n\nEspecially limited non-verbal.  I mean imagine. Adults, kids, take advantage of it all the effing time.  Imagine your child not being able to tell you that their caregivers at school are abusing them.

It would be rude to just assume every kid who's reserved or doesn't like to talk or hates loud noise is autistic. \n\nActually a lot of autistics are just now getting diagnosed in there 30s, 40s, even 70s. It went extremely under diagnosed in women, people of color, and poor people. Basically if you weren't a upper class white little boy who constantly stimmed and had melt downs you probably weren't labeled autistic but were instead labeled shy, or ditsy, or the quiet one, or weird, or slow, or delayed,  or bratty, or antisocial, or stubborn, or a homebody or \"lacking in common sense\" or \" booksmart not street smart\" or \"sensitive\" or even, \"gifted\". You know the Eignstein type who couldn't socialize well but skipped several grades.... so if it's taken professionals this long to realize just how prevalent autism is do you really think lay people could point out every autistic person they've ran across in their life? \n\nYou treated the kids equally, without prejudice, which is refreshing in our culture of ableism --even though you noticed the kid doesn't speak much. You didn't go \"what's wrong with you!\".  Many autistics themselves hate being singled out and infantilized as much as they often are.

Hard. \n\nAutism Speaks can go piss up a rope though.", "That\u2019s the problem everyone seems to only see how people are on here who are autistic. I have a 6 year old who developmentally isn\u2019t even at a year old yet so yeah I\u2019d say my son is a victim. He will never have a normal life, he can\u2019t access school, he can\u2019t talk, he can\u2019t even be around people.

I don\u2019t tell my kids life is hard because they know it\u2019s hard. Not ever child with autism is the same just because you have a child with autism it doesn\u2019t make your child the standard. Just like my child isn\u2019t the standard. \n\nI think this world would be a better place if we could just support each other but when you can\u2019t even admit that things are difficult what chance does anyone have. \n\nDon\u2019t bother messaging back because I won\u2019t read it. I frankly don\u2019t need anymore hate thanks.", "Stop apologizing! You did nothing wrong that lady is being ridiculous. While more noticeable in some than others autism is an invisible disability.

A lot of nonspeaking children and adults have found that they can communicate through AAC devices. \n\nI certainly don't mean to say that it's not hard to raise autistic children in a world designed for allistic people. I definitely think parents of disabled and different kids should seek out assistance and support. My mom was in a group that came together for that purpose (kind of accidentally through a friend) and I know they can be really helpful. And I think there needs to be much more publicly funded support for disabled kids and their families. It's just when people post stuff publicly that makes it sound like their kids are a burden that I find really problematic. Both because kids pick up on those attitudes, and because it spreads negative conceptions about autistic people to others who might not know anyone autistic themselves.", "I work with autistic kids IRL as a special education teacher, so I'm not just talking about people on reddit. Yes, some of them have more challenges than others, but they have their own sources of joy and strength in life too. \n\nWhen parents talk publicly about how hard it is on them to have their kids and how much they have to give up etc, that's traumatic to the kids. Especially when they post videos and pictures and don't make any attempt to hide the child's identity. Every child deserves to feel like their parents are happy to have them and love them the way they are.", "It's a very Western notion that you're entitled to a life without suffering. That if you're moral enough, nothing bad will happen and you'll get prizes at the end for your piety.

Suffering is inevitable but victimhood is a choice.", "Get therapy.", "Agree. This mother sounds pretty self absorbed.

I don\u2019t like the way neurotypical people view the world and social situations. \n\nThank you for sharing your thoughts. It is hard seeing comments from so many parents about how much they hate their lives because of their autistic children. And they make it totally obvious. But I didn\u2019t choose to be born, and the people who adopted me *did* choose to have children. So did my birth mother, who knew it was likely that I was going to have issues. In fact that\u2019s why she abandoned me. Instead of loving me and caring for me (or getting an abortion,) every \u201cparent\u201d I had demonized me (or abandoned me) because of my autism. Even my adoptive \u201cparents\u201d institutionalized me. Abortion would have been harm reduction just because of how shitty all the adults in this situation were.\n\nSome children are autistic and that should be taken into account when people are trying to have kids.

I have two autistic kids, and you can tell, but I often got compliments on how outgoing and social and friendly they were from their therapists. It sounds like she is making their autism her personality trait. She needs some perspective and probably a little afternoon away from the kids with someone her own age. That's not an insult. I was very insular when I had my kids, and have only started talking to adults my age the last few years, it's been a hard adjustment. \n\nIt's funny that other readers are thinking she was leading up to you given them the dog, I wouldn't have thought it, but it makes a kind of sense. Please get your dog chipped if it isn't already. therapy dogs are VERY expensive, though there are programs that can help with the cost. Mom needs to do some research into those. Also, if the boy is in therapy at school or an outside clinic, some therapists have a therapy dog that the kid can work with. \n\nYou have nothing to apologize for. Some kids have such slight symptoms that it takes their pediatrician to point out missed warning signs. \n\nI would not reach out again. You've done more than what was necessary, it's up to mom to make the next move, though I bet she's super embarrassed now and probably won't let go of her pride to fix things.\n\n I do feel bad for the girl, because it sounds like she's going to be missing out on a lot of opportunities because of mom's attitude about her brother.

My aunt had one of my cousins who was non-verbal wear a lanyard explaining she\u2019s non-verbal, so people understand my cousin was not being rude. She just couldn\u2019t express herself. She eventually began to speak in her teens, and it\u2019s still hard to tell she has ASD. That said, I get it everyone is different since autism is so complex.

Though I don't fully think the mother is an AH either (though she is a bit of one since she wanted to completley cut you off for not noticing). Def not weird or wrong of you to not notice a kid is presumably acting shy towards you, since you're an adult and sort of a stranger to them. Honestly it would have been more strange if you immediately assumed he WAS autistic, since there are a lot of reasons/disorders that can make someone nonverbal. I think the mom might have just felt a bit defensive or protective over her son, like maybe worrying you would do something to trigger a meltdown accidentally (some autistic people may get a meltdown from loud sounds, being touched, etc.) bc you wouldnt know to be careful abt that type of thing.
