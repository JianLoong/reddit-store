He is disregarding your boundaries and escalating his behavior. Tell your mom what he\u2019s been doing, how you\u2019ve tried to set boundaries, how he ignores them by not leaving your room and sneaking into your bed, and share you thoughts, logic, and thinking. You may benefit from a book (that I in all honesty haven\u2019t read yet but hear is helpful) called The Gift of Fear. It\u2019s about the purpose of fear and value in taking your own fear seriously. Your terror in that moment is because your body recognized that your boundary had been crossed and you were in danger. With his behavior escalating, I could see you having panic attacks as your body keep trying to warn you that you\u2019re not safe. With his escalating behavior, what is the logical next step? Trust yourself, trust your body/fear, and take a stand to keep yourself safe.\n\nI agree with other commenters that he\u2019s not your friend. Think about it like this, if someone you deeply cared about asked you not to do something because they\u2019re uncomfortable, how would you treat them? It doesn\u2019t even need to be hypothetical- you\u2019re currently holding back and second guessing yourself because you\u2019re afraid of harming his feelings because you\u2019re trying to be a good friend. He doesn\u2019t treat you with the same respect. He pushes and crosses clearly communicated boundaries for his own sexual/emotional gratification.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this OP.
