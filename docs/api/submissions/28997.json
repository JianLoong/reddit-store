Our child is now in first grade and attends a school that is 5 minutes from my home. My ex picks up our child from school on Fridays and returned him on Sundays. Recently he has asked to keep our child on Sunday nights so he can take him to school on Monday mornings because he still works in the city next to where I live. We agreed to try it out, but if it affected our child negatively, we would go back to our old schedule.\n\nHis home is 60 miles away, but he would be traveling during rush hour on Monday mornings. Due to traffic, it can take 1.5 to 2.5 hours for him to get here. Recently, our child was over 20 minutes late to school due to the long commute. My child's teacher informed us that our child was very tired in class and struggled to lead an activity. On another occasion, the teacher at his afterschool program informed me that he fell asleep during the class. My child has also expressed that he prefers not to be in a car for so long to get to school. My child's teacher said it is not ideal for a 6-year-old to leave home at 6AM to sit in traffic and get to school at 8AM. My child's kindergarten teacher also said this last year. My ex disagrees.\n\nHe reluctantly agreed to have our child come back on Sunday nights and asked me to pick up our child from his home, since I wanted him home on a school night. At times we have met halfway to exchange, but I told him that since he moved 60 miles away from his child, it was ultimately his responsibility to drop off our child.

Clearly, it's not working out, according you, your son and his teachers, and you are reverting to the old schedule. It's too bad if your son's father doesn't want to spend two hours in the car on a Sunday but he made the decision to move.", "NTA. \n\nYour ex needs to be an adult and remember what's best for his child. A 2 hour commute is totally unreasonable, especially in the morning. And it's only going to get worse as school times get earlier as the kids get older.", "NTA.\n\nHe brought this on himself, and he needs to follow the court order.  Or you can go back to court which will possibly give you full-time custody since he moved.", "NTA, yeah, you need to go back to the normal way of doing things because this HAS negatively affected your child. If the kid was gonna wake up at 6, their bed time would be even sooner to compensate", "NTA. You guys said that if it affected your child negatively, you would go back to your old schedule. And as shown, its affecting the child negatively. Go back to the old schedule.", "NTA\n\nGoddamn, I'm considering divorce and these question percolate. \n\nHe moved. He bears the consequences. Your duty is to your child. He told you to throw out any duty you thought you had to him (not that this is necessary in a break-up).", "NTA.  I think it's great that you tried it in the name of coparenting.  It's not working for your son and that should be the end of that.  Your ex should be also meeting you halfway for pickup because he's the one who decided to move that far away.\n\nI don't know where you live, but in my area, those commute times get way worse (aside from holidays) in early November through March and my commute usually doubles.", "NTA you are in the right here. He made a choice without thinking through the consequences to the custody schedule. I don\u2019t know if he convinced himself he could handle the drive each Sunday and then realized it sucked or if he figured he could push you to help more, but either way, this is his responsibility to figure out. I think you have been very flexible so far.", "Nta. My kid's journey to school is about 40-50 minutes, but most of that is walking. I wouldn't expect a kid to travel for an hour or more to school unless there was a specific reason. \"Dad not wanting to drive in a Sunday night\" wouldn't be the reason.", "NTA. You tried it and it didn\u2019t work. It was negatively impacting your child and that\u2019s the most important thing.", "There is usually a clause in a custody order that doesn't allow the non-custodial parent to move more than \"x\" miles away?\n\nEither way, you're NTA", "NTA. He\u2019s the one who chose to move and disrupt his child\u2019s routine. In the end, you guys need to do what\u2019s best for your child. Clearly the early wake-ups and long commune are NOT what\u2019s best for your child.", "NTA \n\nFor either scenario. You were willing and it impacted your son negatively in school. He is the one who moved away and tbh, a judge would more than likely agree with you. He made a choice for his family and while it sucks for him it isn\u2019t your problem.", "NTA, you have been more than accommodating considering it was he who chose to put this obstacle in the way. \n\nIf he is so desperate to have more time, tell him he could always move closer, but he can't have it both ways or cry about.", "NTA- his teachers are telling you it\u2019s not working.

I have a question.  If his work is still near by - why the move so far away from his child?  Since not a work decision, I would think being near your child would be a high priority.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d check the custody agreed that is hopefully in writing. Prior to getting back together, my custody agreement with my then ex included if either of us tried to move more than 60 miles away from the other, it had to be agreed upon prior to the move. If the move occureed without agreement, it was the responsibility of the parent that moved for all travel and cost associated with it. \n\nGet it in writing from the teachers how it is impacting your child so it is documentation.", "NTA\n\nI think I would, were I in your situation, talk to a lawyer. Not to try to take away parental rights, but rather to have a new custody agreement put in place. Like, have it legally agreed to that your ex returns your son on Sunday nights. Having an agreement in place that makes sure your son has structure and surety.", "NTA. The commute is negatively affecting your child's performance at school, so your ex has to consider this.\n\nCan you do you exchange at a halfway point?", "That must be location specific. Where I live, school times start later in the day the older the child gets.", "I appreciate your response. His custody/visitation time decreased significantly because he moved, and our child started school. He has our child every weekend. As a compromise, I offered to have our child stay with him whenever there isn't a conflict with school, such as the upcoming Thanksgiving break, in which he'll have an additional 4 days. I don't intend to go for full custody as it's not my intent to decrease his parenting time further.", "Thank you for your response. My ex still works in my neighboring city, so he makes this 120-mile roundtrip commute 4 days a week for work, another trip on his day off to pick up our child from school on Fridays and an additional trip to return our child on Sunday nights. On Fridays during rush hour, it could take them up to 3 hours to get back to his house, but our child doesn't have school the following day so there's minimal impact. Unfortunately, it's a lot of weekly commute time for our child as well.", "Thank you for your response. One of the reasons he provided for wanting to have our child until Monday morning was so our child can spend more time with their half-siblings. I countered that our child would only be losing about 1 hour of meaningful time spent with their half-siblings if we were to revert back to our previous agreement.\n\nBy meaningful time, I mean waking hours. Their bedtime is at 8pm, and our child would leave their house by 6:30AM before the other children are even awake. The only time lost, where they would be awake and spending time with each other, would be between 7-8pm on Sundays when our child returns to my home. He suggested moving our child's bedtime to 7pm on Sunday night to compensate for the early Monday morning, but this wouldn't support his reason above. I still think that it is unreasonable for a 6-year-old to commute for 2 hours in the morning to get to school in bumper to bumper traffic, if there is a better option. It's a very long day for a young child.\n\nWe had close to 50/50 custody before he moved away. Our child has a good relationship with them. I have no intent to keep our child from spending more time with their father or half-siblings, but my ex may not see it that way. If it were not negatively impacting our child at school, I'd have no problem with it.", "Thank you for your response. This is a question for everyone - Has anyone experienced an adjudicated decision where the custodial parent was required to meet halfway or make a roundtrip once a week, when the non-custodial parent moved a considerable distance away?", "I appreciate your response. We recently discussed dismissing the court order, as we have not been strictly enforcing it since we've been flexible and coparenting without conflict for several years. I've offered to go back to court to modify the custody/visitation agreement if we are unable to come to an agreement, but he prefers to not involve the court.", "He was renting a home here until the landlord sold the house. He had the option to rent or buy another place close by and remain in the same city as his job and our child, or buy a new construction home 60 miles away. He chose the latter and made the unilateral decision without having a conversation with me about how this would impact custody. He originally wanted to drive our child 2 hours to school for 2-3 days a week, and this was when our child was 5. He thinks it makes no difference whether our child spends up to 2 hours commuting on Sunday night or Monday morning.\n\nHe said he moved away because he could not afford to live here. He gets paid a good salary plus plenty of overtime at his job and they are not struggling with finances. His wife does not work, and he says he can't make a grown person work if they do not want to. I do live in a HCOL area, but for the amount he paid for his new house, which has 4 bedrooms, an office, solar panels, hot tub and swimming pool, he could have purchased a modest house close by without all the bells and whistles. Our child shares a room with one of their half-siblings at their house (they love sharing a room), so they have an extra bedroom plus an office and did not need such a big house imo.\n\nHis priority was moving his wife and their two children to a new house of her dreams, even though he had other options. The move cost him parenting time with our child, and with his other children, since he spends about 18 to 20 hours per week commuting. He used to live 10 minutes from his work.", "Unfortunately, we don't have that clause in our court-ordered custody agreement. I hadn't even thought about that then, but it would've been a good idea.\n\nThanks for the tip, I will ask his teachers to document this in writing.", "I think your location is the odd one. Everywhere I have lived it fits earlier as kids get older.", "The older kids around us start at 7:10,  the bus route then reruns for the younger kids.  The older kids are home before 3, the younger not til 4:30-4:45.   I think so younger kids have less home alone time for working parents.", "Yes, I think people forget sometimes that kids usually WANT to see both parents and deserve a real chance to have a relationship. It is to his benefit if he can see his dad for as much as he can despite this distance and really any coparenting relationship works best when everyone is prioritizing the child\u2019s best interests. You\u2019ve offered very reasonable adjustments.", "I drove my kiddo a little over an hour to school on Mondays, two hours would be way too much for a 6 year old. I would recommend giving him extra parenting time when possible- he keeps your son for three day weekends and has more time during school breaks and the summer. When your son is a bit older (8 ish)  you can revisit maybe having him drive him to school on mondays", "That still sucks for you since you get no real free time with your son.", "No I haven't (in Europe)", "We have an agreement where if the child doesn\u2019t have school the other parent must meet halfway returning to their custody time. We live an hour away from one another", "His preference doesn\u2019t really matter here. What matters is what is best for the child. A judge needs to be involved since your ex is putting his own convenience first and can\u2019t/isn\u2019t willing to put your child\u2019s wellbeing first and foremost. \nA bit of money spent now for an adjudicated decision will save you a world of headaches down the road.", "Thank you for replying.  In my most humble opion he made a choice - it was not your child - and I have no sympathy for the problems it caused.  \n\nAs others have said, you are making choices that are best for you CHILD, and if he or anyone thinks you are being anything other than a good mother, well I can't think of a polite reply - but they can just get over themselves.\n\nKeep being a good mom - and hugs for your child.", "It was that way when I was a kid (high school 7, middle school 8 & elementary school at 9) but they changed it more recently so high school starts later.", "Where I live now and when I lived in FL it got later the older they get", "Mine used to have the teens dropped off an hour earlier. It made sense because so many of them babysat for the elementary kids, either their siblings or they would get on the elementary school bus for the kids they sat for, or if they could drive they would be there by the time the kids were dropped off. Makes sense to me.", "I agree. He gets extra parenting time when possible - 3 day weekends, school breaks and summer. I just ask that he clear it with his wife if she would be caring for our child while my ex is out of the house for 13-14 hours a day for work. His primary concern is that our child and their half-siblings spend as much time together as possible, which I support.\r  \n\r  \nI also go by the \u201cRight of First Refusal\u201d. If I have to go out of town for work or other reasons during my parenting time, I offer the time to him before I ask a relative. If it\u2019s on school nights, he would spend evenings at my home (while I\u2019m away) to take our child to school in the morning, then he heads into work, which is about 5 minutes from my home.", "I agree with you and was thinking the same thing. A judge needs involved in this. The dad being 2 hours away is long traveling for every weekend. Not to mention it\u2019s affecting the little boy.", "I know there's been a push for it since I was a teenager,  still no change on my area"]}
