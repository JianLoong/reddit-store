It\u2019s nice to see you\u201d solves your \u201cproblem\u201d at the Christmas party. \n\nYou\u2019re just looking for excuses not to attend. It\u2019s very hypocritical to try and use your pregnancy as the reason, but then attend a public comedy show. \n\nTypically I\u2019d go with N T A, because you don\u2019t have to attend events you don\u2019t want, but I will go with YTA here for the hypocrite aspect of it.", "You do what you want to do, but if you are simply offering up that its ONLY health issues keeping you away, i.e. you don't want to come down with something, c'mon.... seriously?  Do you seriously believe that going to.a comedy show, with however many strangers crammed into a room is somehow safer than going to your family?    Hugs and kisses?  Fair enough, probably not any of those at the show, but there are also gobs of strangers  maybe 3 inches from you in 6 directions.\n\nI'd love to see the study to back up which is safer.\n\nI probably would have said  N T A, had you just been honest and said \"the family thing? not in the mood.  I'm 9 months along, I'm uncomfortable, ankles hurt, andI just can't look at 15 family members (or however many there are) all gushing about the baby all night, feeling that they can rub my belly whenever they want, making the same 'oh your life is over once that kid comes!!! hawhawhawhawhawhahhawhawhawhawhawhaw!!!!!!!!!!!' joke all night.   I just want to go to the Yuk Hut and have some laughs on what is likely my last night out \".   But you claim \"oh its just healthier!  not as much disease at the show!!!\".   Please.  YTA", "YTA and a hypocrite. There will be more people at the comedy show than at your family function. It\u2019s hypocritical to say you won\u2019t go to the family function because you want to avoid close contact but then turn around and go to a show where there will be close contact, albeit not hugs/kisses, with even more people. Just tell your relatives you don\u2019t want to hug and kiss them.", "LMAO. YTA. There is NO difference. The comedy show is more \u201cdangerous\u201d to your health with all those strangers in close proximity. Just admit you don\u2019t want to hang with your family already.", "Your MIL is right.  There is no difference between being at a comedy show with strangers and being amongst family.  If \"hugging\" and \"kissing\" is the difference, nobody will fault you by declining that as a pregnant woman about to give birth.  Your reasoning is transparent . . . you would prefer to go to the comedy show than the family function, and that is probably the source of annoyance for your in-laws.  Own your decision and you will get more respect, though, it will not diminish hurt feelings.  \n\nI don't know you and certainly do not know the family dynamics, but seems like this is probably not a good start to relationships with in-laws when you have a baby on the way, and hopefully this will not cause long-term negative consequences for you, hour husband and your child.", "YTA - and your logic is flawed in that you think that being in a room with around 100 people is safer than being in a room of about 20.  I believe that you just want to go to the comedy show more than you want to go to the family party.  It's that simple and yet you lack the courage to tell the truth.", "YTA...however I'd ditch a family thing for a comedy show and gladly live with the AH label.  You do you.", "YTA.\n\nA comedy show is going to have way more people than your family event, people you have no knowledge of and who are going to share close quarters with you, especially at bottleneck points like the entrance. \n\nGo to the comedy show if you\u2019d rather go to the comedy show but don\u2019t hide behind the excuse that it\u2019s safer.  \n\nYou would rather do mental gymnastics than admit what you really want.", "YTA...you're free to spend your time however you want, but don't use faulty science as an excuse. Admit to yourself that you just don't want to go to the family thing.", "I think it\u2019s just a matter of priorities. You just don\u2019t want to miss this comedy show. Which you might not be able to do for quite some time as a new mother. And as a new mom, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be seeing a lot of your family when they come over to see the new baby. \nSo maybe you should have just said you can\u2019t attend the family function because you have tickets to a show and that might be the last time you\u2019ll get to watch something like that until your baby grows.", "YTA. A public venue with a large group of people and countless unsanitary surfaces is much different than asking family to not hug or kiss you. If you don\u2019t want to go to Christmas, don\u2019t. But trying to rationalize that a public comedy show is safer than a family Christmas is ridiculous and hypocritical.", "YTA for making up a pretty transparent excuse. You'd rather go to the show. That's it. If getting ill was truly a worry, you'd stay home", "YTA. Just be honest and say you have other plans because your excuse indeed sounds nonsensical.", "If you were just like \"I'd rather go to a comedy show than this family function, sorry I've had these plans for awhile and I'm really excited about it\", then you'd not be the ah.\n\nBut your MIL is right and you're just making up excuses and not being honest (either to yourself or to your MIL) = Soft YTA", "YWBTA if you use virus-transmission as an excuse to go to the show and not the family meetup.    \n\nAt the comedy show, even if you keep a mask on 100% of the time, you will still be in a crowded room with a lot of strangers who won't let you know if they get sick the next day.  Probably a room with poor ventilation and other unmasked people.  \n\nAt a family meetup, you might be able to ask people to test before attending, to open windows, and to let the host know if they get sick afterwards.  You should also be able to stay masked yourself, and to decline hugs and kisses.  And if your family is generous and compassionate, and they support your need to be particularly careful, you could even ask them to stay masked while you drop in for half an hour and then leave before the food.\n\nHowever, since you are demonstrating by your actions that you are prioritizing going to the comedy show over seeing them, and since you are not being honest with them about your motivations, it would be unfair to expect them to take inconvenient precautions.  Of course they are going to be hurt, and you will need to deal with the longer-term consequences of that.    \n\n\nMore specific issues of why a visit with your in-laws is stressful and exhausting, and what your partner can do to alleviate those for you, should be examined in the longer term - ideally start talking about this before your child arrives, so that the two of you can set workable boundaries together.  \n\nConsider re-evaluating your stance on both the show and the family do. If it is too tiring for you to do both the same weekend, consider whether you can drop in at the family gathering and attend only one set for the comedy show.  Is it worth alienating your mother-in-law when your baby is due soon, to go to the show?  If it is worth it for you, is it worth it for your partner?  Your partner should be the one communicating to their relatives about what the two of you need.  What if your partner goes to the party and you go to the show?  Or you travel separately to both events?  Also, why does your MIL know about the comedy show?  Maybe in future you both need to put her on an information diet.", "Yta you are still in close contact at a comedy show and probably even more so with so many people", "Both events involve lots of people in an enclosed space breathing all over each other. The comedy show involves way, *way* more people breathing on you. \n\nJust mask up for both events. If your family acts like you're insulting them for wearing a mask, point out that there's pneumonia, RSV, and influenza going around right now and you refuse to risk infection so close to having a vulnerable newborn in the house.\n\nSeriously, 25% of the people in my office have lung infections right now, including me. I'm an experienced bronchitis-haver, and this infection is on another level, you do not want this.", "NAH \n\n If you're really avoiding getting sick, you don't close yourself in a theater with hundreds of people.\n\nYou don't want to go to that Christmas function for whatever reason, it's your right. Accept it, be honest and stop making excuses.", "YTA, just for using your pregnancy as an excuse.\nA Christmas party is a much lesser \"health risk\" than a public comedy show\nIf you don't want to mingle with your family, own that and say you don't want to. Don't start using your baby as a bargaining chip even before it is born", "NTA but idk if going to a comedy show at 9 months pregnant during flu and cold season is a good kdea either.", "YTA. What a hypocrite. Just tell MIL you don\u2019t want to be with her and family. \n\nBut by all means sit the same distance from strangers at the show. \ud83d\ude44", "It\u2019s OK to skip family functions. Your MIL is too involved in your social life.", "NTA - but be honest; the real reason is you just want to go to the comedy show you already planned to go to... which is a valid excuse (given you got the tickets before the party was scheduled).", "NTA - You can do whatever you are comfortable doing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have more of a chance of getting sick at the comedy club than you do being around your family. You\u2019d be better to skip both events and stay home.", "Oh puullleeezzze if anyone believes your reason here, I have a bridge I could sell them. YTA", "YTA. You're going to be around more people and thus more chances to possibly get sick especially at this time of year. They may not be in close physical contact with you but it's still a bad decision. \n\nYou could also lay down restrictions with your family so you can go and enjoy the family event.  Maybe limit to handshakes only and then wash your hands vigorously afterwards.", "YTA\n\nI mean, just go to the comedy show and enjoy it, but don\u2019t make up these lame ass excuses that one is inherently more dangerous than the other.\n\nIf safety was actually your primary concern, you\u2019d absolutely skip both.

You aren't going to convince anyone that you didn't choose yourself over your family.", "Actually, a packed indoor venue is probably more likely than a family gathering to be a health issue - except kids are little germ factories because of daycares and schools.\n\nWear your mask and attend both, but stop with the futile mental gymnastics.
