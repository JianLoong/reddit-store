Your younger daughter is acting very entitled.\n\nHowever, I bristled at the way you characterize a gift of $1,000 as \u201cpaying for\u201d your child\u2019s wedding. If you do give her $1,000 or even $2,000, while nice of you, I really hope that you don\u2019t go around telling people that you\u2019re \u201cpaying for\u201d the wedding. That would be obnoxious.", "NTA. Money towards a wedding is a gift, not a necessity - and you had made it very clear the amount each daughter should expect. Molly may go through an emergency at some point in the future and that $1000 may come in handy at an unexpected time, but in any case it\u2019s your decision what to do with it now that she turned it down. Based on how Lucy is acting, I\u2019d be tempted to withdraw the original offer and have her pay for her wedding on her own since she\u2019s being so ungrateful.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nWhilst reading, I was worried you were going to not give Lucy anything, just because Molly hadn't accepted it.\n\nBut no! Lucy wanted her cake and then Molly's, too.\n\nI absolutely agree with your stance OP.", "NTA.  She sounds very entitled that she wanted the money her sister should have gotten.", "NTA. Your daughter is being extremely entitled and I wouldn\u2019t encourage her entitlement either. There was nothing wrong with her asking you to contribute the extra money, but she should have accepted your response. She lost me when she became demanding. \n\nStand your ground, OP!", "NTA.  You were willing to help her, but she wanted to double up.  At this point, I wouldn't contribute anything to the wedding, nor would I attend the wedding.   Chances are she will trying to get back in your home in a few years anyway.", "NTA - This sounds like Lucy is an entitled brat. The question is, is this the hill you wanna die on? The consequences of this are going to be a strained if not broken relationship with one of your daughters. Maybe she comes around realizing her mistake but who knows considering her current personality.\n\nThat your husband is willing to roll over for this kind of attitude is giving me a good indication of where the entitlement came from.\n\nAlways sad to see how money can break relationships, good luck OP.", "NTA\n\nVery simple. Not surprised that Lucy is the younger one. The fact that she even asked for Molly's unused money... You are doing everything right. Teaching your kid to be more appreciative, respectful, and mature is far more important than giving them every penny they feel like they deserve out of you for their wedding. Proof that you don't have to have a lot of money to be a good parent, sometimes too much money can make it more tempting and subtle to be a bad parent. I think if you gave her the extra money, she would be missing out on a great life lesson.", "For some reason this reminds me of my sister\u2019s MIL. Her MIL did not have a debit card for ages. Finally my sister went to the bank with MIL and got her a debit card. At home she explained how MIL May draw cash up to 10k$ on her card. MIL started insisting that they go NOW and get that 10k $$. The kicker? There\u2019s not more than couple of hundred in the account. MIL insisted that 10k$$ is what the bank promised she can withdraw and so she can do that. So let\u2019s go draw that amount before it disappears was the MIL\u2019s argument. It was a shit show and my sister was blamed for MIL \u201closing\u201d 10k$$. OP is NTA.", "NTA.", "You promised the $1000 so you should keep your promise. You, your husband and your daughter need to talk about the other $1000.", "NTA, and I have a feeling your husband factors into Lucy's entitlement.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she were planning an \"extravagant\" wedding, as you put it, that amount would be meaningless. So she is probably using good judgment with regard to spending. I can't imagine making such a big deal about such a small amount of money when it comes to your own child's joy on her wedding day.", "What exactly do you expect her to do to show you this appreciation?  Is this about fairness? Or how she asked for the extra money?", "op=NTA\n\nLucy is being greedy.
