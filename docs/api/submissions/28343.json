Whenever a partner starts going on about this sort of thing I get this nagging perception that what they're really saying without saying it is, \"I want you to support me, do all the work, pay all the bills, and buy me things without any contributions from me.\" This is particularly bad when women do it, because men just don't have the social capital to even begin saying this is a good idea without a decent argument, but women who want this will often lean into sexism hard core and insult a reluctant husband for not being \"man enough\", among other shitty shitty things, in spite of the fact that what they're suggesting is that he become a single father of two ~~kids~~\"dependants.\"\n\nNTA for not wanting to break your back to support someone who is just jelly of their SAHM friends.", "Be glad you won\u2019t have to pay child support once you divorce her.

It's very possible that she could still feel burnout even if she's working hours someone else can work easily.", "Legit. I'm a SAHM. I have depression and anxiety and both my sons have ADHD. There are days I feel like I'd rather beat my head against a brick wall because they're so frustrating about getting ready for school. I get up with my partner at 5:45am because part of our morning routine is hugs and waving them off as they leave for work. No, I don't go back to bed. We don't have a nanny. Closest I come to that are the two Roombas (one vacuum, one mop. I have a herniated disk that HATES me doing those manually. Shit I learned the hard way). The audacity of this woman is bonkers.", "Having a nanny that early because her kid gets up at 6.30 but she won't, is genuinely ridiculous.\n\nShe wants to take 2 extra days off because she's jealous of not spending time with her kid, but she also doesn't want to spend all the extra time off with her kid..... \n\nbro.", "Child goes to day care at 7, partner and I start work at 9, we both still manage to get up at 6, to get child ready for day care and spend time with child before going to daycare. Then we catch up on housework and have breakfast together etc. your partner seems incredibly lazy", "Yeah, I'm a SAHM too to 3, currently fighting of a congestion headache and weak, tired heavy muscles, and can barely walk, want to know what I did this morning, vacuum, mop and laundry, and currently curled up with toddler watching TV and having \"quiet time\" so I can rest a little.", "She got upset because she wanted that credit card for herself and didn't want oversight on what she spends. What kind of person gets upset about having a magic board that brings you whatever you write on it?? This b1t\u00a2h is both divorced from reality AND a gold digger.", "The Nanny.  She is going to extend the Nanny to all day on those days.", "Right? No such thing as sick leave (not that most Americans get that anyway. I'm Australian).", "OP posted that the GF makes 50k, and that he makes 20x her income... He responded to one of my comments, and didn't correct me, so...\n\nJust because he only withdraws $150k, and leaves the other $850k in the business, rather than pay himself out, doesn't change that fact... I mean, I have a business as well, that's exactly how it works...", "And she knows this, and will continue to use her son to manipulate you and push things further. This is just the beginning. At the end of the day he still has a father paying child support chances of staying in this kid\u2019s life forever are very low and will require you to put up with immense amounts of crap and will eventually break you.", "Ugh.  I had this experience, though not quite as long-exposed as you.\n\nGot a text months after she reeled back the relationship from another guy.  She had cheated on him with me, and neither he nor I knew.  Turned out it was more than us, but we were the favorites.  She had stopped having her son see him after I showed up.  Then from me when she tried to flip bavk and it blew up in her face.\n\nI still feel bad for the kid.\n\nEdit: I can't have kids either, so I understand the approach.", "Honestly she sounds like as bad a gf as she sounds like a bad mom. Time to make her contribute somehow or break it off and make her mind her own child. She's using you, friend, she is not a partner to you in any way and she's getting away with making you do everything and it's still pushing boundaries. Don't let her. You're NTA but this relationship sounds like a dead end.", "That would make sense. Sounds like she's super fortunate to even be given this as an option.   She sounds way too comfortable with your money,  considering you're not married or engaged, and only 2 years into a relationship.  \nNTA", "All the other moms can cope with that. If she can't, she doesn't even belong in a group with sahm's. Why does she want to hang with them?", "But thats not what maintenance is for, right? Its child support. Its meant to be for clothes food etc", "Hey fellow Aussie.", "You\u2019re basically saying she should pay even less than she already does? And the nanny is paid for by maintenance money so it\u2019s not coming out of her pocket either. She has 1! Bill to pay", "True!", "No, it\u2019s more than reasonable to use it for childcare to allow the recipient parent to work. That being said, using it to facilitate sitting on your arse while your partner (who is not the father of the child) pays all major bills, is wildly unreasonable.\nI\u2019d be looking to separate.", "I'm saying that relationships where there's a very big income disparity are complicated, and I can't see it working if they keep separate finances to such a degree indefinitely...\n\nIt's all well and good to say separate finances, but how do you have a long term relationship with someone when you're making a 50k pounds, and they're making a million??\n\n**OP literally makes in 1 day what the GF makes in a month!**\n\nWhen they go on vacation, do they each pay their own way? even if OP covers expenses, is it going to feel like charity / like he's doing her a favor?\n\nAt some point, you have to be partners... there has to be a sense of equality... maybe OP is not there yet with this woman, but I just don't see how he'll ever be able to have a healthy, equal relationship with a partner who doesn't earn as much, if he remains so tight on the purse strings...", "Our teen son wake up 6 o'clock am to walk  his dog.", "I already commented but this sounds like escalation even more so, she's taking steps. YOu're taking on more of the kids care, you're taking on more costs, she's dropping time iwht her kid but also somehow wants you to pay for her to work less so she can spend time iwht her kid... except she wants more nanny time during her time off so she doesn't spend time with her kid.\n\nIf you agree, in another 6 months she'll take another day off, in another year it will be a full time nanny, she ain't working and you're paying for everything. She's taking you for a ride.\n\nIt's supposedly her dream career, can you imagine how your career would slow down if you took 2 extra days out of work a week, your progress would die, your bosses would not push you forward over others. Everything here is a massive red flag.", "This gravy train has biscuit wheels", "Wow.. I am not a morning person but I manage to not only get myself ready for work but also my toddler and school aged son at the same time. Sounds like she used to manage too.. until she no longer had to with you.. and as you say\u2026 you\u2019ve made it a little too easy for her now. Yet here she is, asking for more. Definitely a resounding no", "Yea personally that would be enough for me, id be gone. She just wants to use you.", "Yeah, childcare so she can work is reasonable. But if I was paying maintenance and found out it was being used for a nanny so my ex can sleep in....I'd be livid.", "Your experience is not the same as everyone's, though.", "Why? Because this is a real experience for many people with ADHD. You can't just change the way your brain works overnight."]}
