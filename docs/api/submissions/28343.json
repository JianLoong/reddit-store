Whenever a partner starts going on about this sort of thing I get this nagging perception that what they're really saying without saying it is, \"I want you to support me, do all the work, pay all the bills, and buy me things without any contributions from me.\" This is particularly bad when women do it, because men just don't have the social capital to even begin saying this is a good idea without a decent argument, but women who want this will often lean into sexism hard core and insult a reluctant husband for not being \"man enough\", among other shitty shitty things, in spite of the fact that what they're suggesting is that he become a single father of two ~~kids~~\"dependants.\"\n\nNTA for not wanting to break your back to support someone who is just jelly of their SAHM friends.", "Be glad you won\u2019t have to pay child support once you divorce her.

I earn 20 times what she does and she's well paid in her role.  Even so I don't want to be the provider except for children (which I can't have naturally myself)", "Ok, whatever works for you. But plenty of parents of 3-year-olds get up more than 20 minutes before they are due to leave work in order to, you know, *care for their child in the morning*. If the nanny is working out great, that's fine, but it wouldn't be outlandish for her, as the parent whose work starts at 8am, to have more responsibilities for the kid in the morning, and doing so MIGHT help her reach her goal relating to changing or extending nanny time to have more time off.", "She can\u2019t get up an hour earlier for her own child? How does she think she\u2019s going to \u2018hang out\u2019 with him??", "OP, I don't want to come across as mean or unfeeling, I know you adore this child, but have you ever looked into adopting a child of your own? You seem to have so much love to give to a child, but I'm afraid if this woman leaves you and takes her boy, you will have no rights to him and you would be left with no one.", "You know that it\u2019s not your son?", "He has literally no legal rights to this child.", "That still doesn't answer why she's not contributing any percentage to the household living costs?", "Not to sound mean, this is only a suspicion, but I think this comment says so very much about your situation. \n\nYou can't have your own kids, so this was your way to being a dad. It sounds like the joy of that has blinded you. You are providing nearly everything. You call him our son, but if she left tomorrow, who's son will he be? \n\nI am not saying this relationship is terrible or that it can't be fixed, but I strongly suspect you are letting her walk all over you in order to compensate and feel more secure in what you see as your role as dad. \n\nYou may really want to see a therapist and ask about that and possibly see if you can learn to better remove that bias from how much you offer and do for her. \n\nAt the bare minimum, perhaps going to an income based split of bills? If you make 20 times what she does, she could at least be paying 5% of the bills. She could at least be the main care giver. She could get herself up on the morning an hour earlier to be with and care for her kid instead of paying someone else to do it. It somewhat disturbs me that being with a nanny is a better start to his day in your eyes than being with his actual mom.", "I tried to suggest this, use the money from 3 days of nanny time on the other two days but got a resounding NO.  She doesn't think she can cope with getting up so early, then getting him ready and ready for work herself.", "Heck, I get up early because I have a dog and 2 cats that all require some sort of specific care in the morning. \n\nPoint is, if something which you have repsonsibility over needs attention, you get your lazy ass out of bed and deal with it.\n\nShe sounds like an incredible leech to me.", "Think she wants to hang out with the other mums not her own kid, she\u2019ll likely manage that but heaven forbid she gets her own kid up in the morning.", "Depending on where you are that's not true. Men who have taken on a parental role for long enough time can be granted custody or visitation right in some jurisdiction, or even be required to pay child support for a child that they aren't the father of in some jurisdictions.", "It does. She knows he is attached to the kid and cant have his own naturally. Shes using that to get away with murder.", "Did you not read how he makes 20x as more? He chose to move in with this girl, it\u2019s embarrassing to ask someone rent money when they\u2019re making let\u2019s say 50k a year and the guy is making $1 million. She couldnt even afford 20% of his lifestyle", "Why did you marry someone so incredibly lazy?", "So she can\u2019t get up a little earlier to spend time with her own young child but she can cut back to part time work to play with the other moms and indulge herself? \n\nAre you sure about this person in your life?", "As a nanny for many years, I have seen many women similar to your partner in action. Let me warn you now, they only get worse and worse. She will ruin your life. Leave her asap so you don\u2019t find yourself obliged to help her and the child legally. You are young and successful, you will find a woman who deeply appreciates you.", "Same lol I need to give my cat his insulin", "Yeah. I\u2019m thinking she just wants to work less.\n\nBeing a stay at home parent is *hard*. It ain\u2019t all hanging out and visits to the park.", "But she\u2019s already getting child support from the bio dad.", "This!! She sounds awful!!", "He's  a sugar daddy, and he doesn't know it", "I read it, however, it sounds like he does a lot with the child, does the housework and she does.....? Apparently all her income is her own and the child support pays for the nanny...", "Not married, she wasn't always like this and when I met held down her job with an infant as a single parent.  I just provided the cushion to make life easier.  Seems its a little too easy now.", "Woot, woot! Me too my friend!", "Yep, if he doesn't marry her or adopt the kid (or both) I seriously doubt he gets custody or visitation if things go wrong.", "Damn she\u2019s living well - good to see a single mum get a break, but she sounds like she\u2019s getting little too comfortable..", "Tell her to step up.", "She's taking advantage of you", "So she isn\u2019t your wife, this isn\u2019t your son and you pay for EVERYTHING except the nanny and her car. She has a job, but wants you to pay for MORE nanny time so she can work less to be a SAHM, but not stay at home, instead hanging out with SAHMs and do fun stuff? \n\nIf you are okay with this more power to you, but maybe do some deep thinking of what the hell you are getting out of this relationship. She seems to have it made!", "Why does it seem you care for and love her child way more she does? It seems she makes no effort whatsoever.", "She's using you, not only financially but also for free child care. \n\n>I just provided the cushion to make life easier.\n\nWhose life is easier? Certainly not yours", "Seems like a bad situation to be in honestly. Sounds like she might be looking for a free ride.", "And now you know that if you *did* get married, she would likely somehow manage to find herself unemployed and immediately hanging out with those other SAHMs at Starbucks during the day... don't get married and make sure you are securely providing for your own birth control.", "Whatever you do, do not marry her. Then you'd be on the hook for alimony payments when she decides to quit her job...\n\nHonestly though, you need to take a hard look at what is happening. You are supporting/subsidizing her existence and she's trying to take further advantage of that.", "Everything can\u2019t be her way - she needs to make some comprises !", "She might have some mental health issues. They often come with a lack of energy. She might not actually be as selfish as it seems.", "I hope you got a prenup before you married.", "So is the child yours?", "Trying that", "Or she can be a single parent again. She sounds like she found a good gig. OP pays for everything and either does all of the work at home or hires it out. Wife's money is HER own.", "Totally", "Sounds like the child\u2019s father pays for the Nanny, so her salary would only be paying for her car."]}
