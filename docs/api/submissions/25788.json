It is customary in our culture that women stay with their in-laws after marriage. I didn't subscribe to this and told my husband (then bf) before marriage itself that I want to live separately. He agreed, since he himself wanted to live away from parents and build his own life. \n\nBut as a compromise, we would still visit them and stay at their place every couple of months. It is again customary, DIL helps MIL with household tasks (The stench of patriarchy). In our house, that is mine and husband's, we are equals. We do chores together. In in-laws place, it's always his mom who does majority of chores. She was a SAHM too. \n\nWhen I am visiting I am expected to help her with the chores. Not my husband, just me. I just rope him in as well. The major issue is that everyone there wakes up at 5.30-6am. That's way too early for me even on days when I have work. Since we go there on my off days, I just want to sleep in. Atleast till 8-9am. \n\nInitially they didn't say much about this. Just a bit of snide comments that I let go. Choose my own battles and all. But today morning my MIL made a big show of how I never help her with chores. Let me clarify, she wakes at 6 am and finishes most tasks by 9am. By the time I am awake, it's all done. I help prep, but that doesn't count to her. The fact I don't slave away in kitchen is making her mad. \n\nWhen she went on a whole woe on me act, my husband, who normally supports me also got mad at me. He asked why I couldn't wake up few days out of a month earlier than I want to and help his mom. When I said, he can help his mom himself since he wakes up anyway, he said that's not the point. He said he doesn't ask much of me and this is least I can do. Respect his parents when we are staying under their roof. \n\nI got mad and told him, I don't want to stay under their roof and neither do I have to. With that I just packed my bags and left that place. \n\nNow my parents and husband are blasting my phone for over reacting. \n\nAITA ?\n\nCause I see a lot of comments asking me to help my MIL : no one has anywhere to be. It's literally the weekend. There is no requirement for things to be done by that time. Other than the fact \"it is how we do here\". And I help her meal prep. Cut veggies and everything the night before. I clean the house too, roping in my husband as well (though we literally visit for two days).\n\nAlso to people who commented I shouldn't go then : my initial agreement, before marriage with them and my husband was that I wouldn't go. I work full time in a different city. I want to relax on weekends. They kept calling, begging and guilttriping. I finally agreed to visit. As in one weekend a month. We go there Friday after office and return Sunday night. That's literally the entire weekend and duration of stay. \n\nIf I wasn't there, I would be sleeping in till 12 noon of after. Husband knows this well. Because I respect his home I am getting at 8-9. It feels like yet another working day to me. Getting at 6 am is like overtime on a already hectic 12 day week.\n\nTo all who are guessing : Yes, I am Indian. From Kerala to be precise. And yeah, I know many other cultures have this in common.

The point is not that there are chores that need to be done; the point is to make you subservient and suffer because it has always the role of the woman to suffer. Good for you for saying no. If they want you to help out, and it's not unreasonable as a guest that you might, they can figure out some chores that you can do when you're awake like shopping, cooking dinner, cleaning up after dinner. Tell your husband even part time misogyny is not your jam.", "I don't blame you. When I first starting dating my husband and visiting his family, I would get side eyes from all the women who cooked, set the table and cleaned up when I refused to go along. Good Lord, his MOM barely sat to eat at all as she kept catering to everyone. It felt so awkward to me as that was not my family experience.\n\nALL the men sat on their a$$es. My husband was pulled aside and given a talk. \n\nOn the drive home, he mentioned it to me. I said \"when I see all the MEN pitching in and helping, then I will.\" Now this is a husband who cooked every night for us with no problem. I cleaned up after dinners. He fully participated in all the household chores as we both worked. \n\nThe next time we visited, he got up and started clearing the table. Finally, a couple of the \"boys\" followed his lead. Now, everyone pitches in to help.\n\nNot sure how difficult the cycle would be to break if it's cultural. My situation was more American generational. \n\nBut do you want your future daughter to get that message that women serve while men get served?", "NAH\n\nThey can expect you to behave a certain way when you visit. It's their house after all. You can however choose not to visit if their rules compromise your values too much. You leaving actually was the perfect solution. \n\nIf they want you to visit again and help out then they have got to leave you at least enough room to manoeuvre to do it in your own time. You don't have children yet, please make all the use you can of the glory years of sleeping in. Even if you decide not to have children, please enjoy the glory of sleeping in. Sleeping in is glorious and is definitely not something I'd be willing to compromise on. Maybe you could come to an agreement with your MIL about some chores she can just leave till you are ready to do it. Like vacuuming and dusting or something.

It is no longer working, so may need to be re-evaluated. Maybe you staying a hotel, maybe you do not visit every time (or at all), etc. \n\nHowever, stay strong.

And the fact that your husband is not expected to help makes it feel icky. He wants you to compromise for his parents, and you already have by going to visit and stay with them. \n\nYou absolutely should respect his parents when under their roof, and he should respect you under any roof, and you don't need to be under their roof, so you got out.", "When it's part of the culture and you are absolutely not going to subscribe to it, then you shouldn't stay with them.  If you are coming to stay with them occasionally to offset you not living there after marriage, but to still appease the culture, you have to go the whole way.  Being a guest in their home and making more work isn't why you are supposed to be there.   If you just want to visit, then stay at a hotel.

All the women she grew up with were expected to show their love through looking after the home and she had often believed a man couldn't love you if you didn't do those things. She therefore inadvertently instilled in her sons to respect women In the same way they respect men and she is now seeing the results of that. But also she was happy it was me. \n\nThings changed a lot after that. Thr passive aggressive comments all but disappeared.", "This is great. I always wonder how people allow their children to go out into the world without an ounce of independence. I can't imagine having to rely on a marriage to allow me to have a cup of coffee. Aside from the patriarchal BS, it's so sad for the men that end up alone either from not marrying or losing a spouse, and they suddenly have to learn all this stuff as adults. \n\nIMO the whole point of parenting is teaching your children how to survive without you.", "With more patriarchal cultures it is always best to take things slow. I wish you could share your experience with more people. The mothers and sisters that enforce these same requirements over new wives of their sons are victims of abuse. I am not here to say that one culture is better than the other, but to say that all people regardless of gender have value and should be respected. What you did was the most diplomatic and best way to deal with this problem. Your husbands mother saw through your beliefs and action that her son saw her as more than a servant. You should be proud of yourself, many people would create a wall that fractured the family. You created a wound that when they mend it will create a stronger family.", "That's wonderful.  Your last paragraph brought tears to my eyes. Kindness and empathy. And patience.  Wish there was more of that!", "Thank you for sharing! I\u2019m from Australia but our Indian population is growing (we are a multicultural nation!). It\u2019s good to know what is the cultural \u2018norm\u2019 and what is changing.", "Kudos to your MIL too for being willing to see your side of it too.", "Bravo! Well done!", "I'm Italian, and though not as prominent as in Indian culture,  it's still there.  I've told my wife she's not required to do that,  and my family is mildly annoyed at me for it.  In this case,  I think OP is NTA.", "Fuck that so hard.", "The men were brought up in these \"traditions\" and benefit from them, so why would they complain or try to bring about change?  \n\n\nIt is a rare man who can think outside the box and actively change the traditional gender roles.", "I understand that explains a lot of generational nonsense - the people who are old now suffered through doing it the traditional way when they were younger so it seems unfair that they don't get to benefit from it\n\nLike opposition to new government benefits - they had to work for it and have to subsidize the next generation getting it", "And I\u2019m so glad many in the comments above experienced that change but lets be real some of us have been taking the crap and trying to effect change for 30 plus years and getting almost nowhere. To anyone reading please find a partner that agrees with this instead of thinking they or their family will change or you may be in for years of losing battles and misery.", "Oddly enough, the real giveaway to me as someone who grew up in the US was the phrase \"today morning\". The only people I've heard that from were either from India or Pakistan.", "Well more like - Raja Beta :P", "This is such a great idea, will totally try this strategy out", "I think what is huge about it though is that *she* did it. *She* made it happen. She totally stepped into her power, and that's so beautiful. And also what a gift she is giving to your brothers. They will have a much better chance at a happy relationship with the a mom like that. You and your mom are \ud83d\udc4c.", "i fully respect all these super hardworking muslims and indians and other families also who wake up early and do chores. they clean their whole house before 9am! That said, if OP is working full time, then she needs to take time to match her workplace's routine. If she needs her morning sleep on her rest days, then she should be entitled to it. If she ever wants to use the 5am cleaning routine, after she gets comfy with her job, it is her choice. \n\nThis matriarchy patriarchy thing is not good. What is important is the income earner man or wife etc, needs space to focus on their work.", "Precisely this. Patriarchal beliefs are so deeply ingrained in our society most of us don\u2019t even realize they are there. \n\nThe weaponized incompetence you described (your sibs useless ex) is something I will not tolerate. I have taken to calling it out.\n\nOP is definitely NTA.", "Exactly! \u201cYou can\u2019t force others into your way.\u201d That\u2019s the real problem.\n\nI\u2019m from the US but recognized this behavior instantly from my own family. The real problem is not the different opinions, but MIL\u2019s lack of respect and flexibility. If MIL truly just wants help cleaning, she can leave some cleaning for OP and her husband to do when they wake up. She chooses not to do this, and complains. So it seems the real problem is that she wants everything her way, and wants to be in control, and is not willing to compromise at all. Why are so many MILs like this no matter where you go?", "Wait. \"Today morning\".. Is incorrect?", "Now you made me cry \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "\ud83d\ude2d such a beautiful thing to tell you", "I love that for you \u2764\ufe0f that at least they knew you could live differently", "My husband uses this tactic A LOT! \u201cI just don\u2019t know how to do it! You\u2019re so good at it\u201d etc etc.. Well I\u2019m pregnant now - Guess who\u2019s going to suddenly not know anything about looking after a new born, and then infant and young child. \u201cOh no! The baby needs to be soothed if it cries? I didnt know that. U do SUCH a great job of rocking him/her to sleep. You\u2019re the best Dad in the WHOLE WORLD! \ud83e\udd7a\u201d two can play at the same game! My husband\u2019s in for a taste of his own medicine.", "More then probable- completely accessible. Divorce reason statistics are available to read.", "I have too. It\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to get married or be in a relationship ship honestly after my last one.\nI do not want kids-why do I want to take care of a grown ass adult? Ik my ex was pissed when I asked him to pick up when he stayed over 24/7. I reminded him my toddler cousin(3 at that time) cleaned up his toys and his room,he also\u201dfed\u201dthe dogs,he helped his mom pick up dirty clothes. If a toddler can help he can to. \nThat caused a lot of fights. Lol\n\nDidn\u2019t help I always got \u201cwell it\u2019s ur house!\u201d From him and my step dad\u2026\u2026like no. Ur over 5:7 days a week. U tell me cus it\u2019s MY place u can\u2019t put ur dirty clothes in the hamper? Pick up UR trash/mess? Put dishes in the DISHWASHER?\nTake out the trash? \nWhen I scrubbed around the toilet every Sunday,bleached the bathroom,mopped&s cribbed the floors,vacuumed,did laundry,deep cleaned everywhere for 4-7 HOURS. \n\nBut u can\u2019t clean up after urself? \nIt\u2019s why I don\u2019t like my step dad either. He\u2019s over 50 and gets mad at my mom for not helping him pack.", "It's not incorrect, per se, it's just that native speakers would say \"this morning\" instead.", "It maybe grammatically correct. Not sure. But it sounds really strange in North American English and British English. Very awkward.", "Man, ain\u2019t that the truth", "DUI?  IED?"]}
