Get a hotel or something when you visit.", "NTA - If you\u2019re visiting on the days that you are off work, it\u2019s not fair that only you are expected to wake up at the crack of dawn and slog away at the kitchen. I\u2019m south east asian, and I completely get your situation. Have a conversation with your husband and find a compromise - that he will be in there helping with you as well. It\u2019s about time people start accepting that men are expected to do the house work as well. If his Mom is a SAHM and his parents have found that balance where his Dad works and his Mom is responsible for all the household work, that\u2019s okay - FOR THEM! They should accept that you work as well and it\u2019s your time off work, so if you\u2019re expected to help out in anyway, your husband should be as well! Stick to this and don\u2019t give in or further down the road you\u2019ll be expected to may way more compromises and you will find it more and more difficult to say No.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't overreacting and you are entitled to make these decisions but you also knew before marriage how things would be.

First, I get to sleep in until 8am. Second, you're there next to me helping. This is your mother after all.\"\n\nUltimately, what matters is if you and your husband can come to an agreement that you both agree is respectful and considerate.", "NTA. I wouldn't want to wake up early on one of my precious days off either. Adding in the blatant sexist expectations that are behind the ask this is nonsense. Either your husband can wake up, her can stand up for you, or you can stop going.\n\nYou're going there as a favor to him and then, not because you want to. You don't owe them free labor.", "NTA. Don\u2019t concede to those stupid, outdated patriarchal rules. I\u2019d not visit the ILs anymore, let hubby go on his own.

Who knows. Culturally this is difficult bc I\u2019m not from that culture.

The point is not that there are chores that need to be done; the point is to make you subservient and suffer because it has always the role of the woman to suffer. Good for you for saying no. If they want you to help out, and it's not unreasonable as a guest that you might, they can figure out some chores that you can do when you're awake like shopping, cooking dinner, cleaning up after dinner. Tell your husband even part time misogyny is not your jam.", "I don't blame you. When I first starting dating my husband and visiting his family, I would get side eyes from all the women who cooked, set the table and cleaned up when I refused to go along. Good Lord, his MOM barely sat to eat at all as she kept catering to everyone. It felt so awkward to me as that was not my family experience.\n\nALL the men sat on their a$$es. My husband was pulled aside and given a talk. \n\nOn the drive home, he mentioned it to me. I said \"when I see all the MEN pitching in and helping, then I will.\" Now this is a husband who cooked every night for us with no problem. I cleaned up after dinners. He fully participated in all the household chores as we both worked. \n\nThe next time we visited, he got up and started clearing the table. Finally, a couple of the \"boys\" followed his lead. Now, everyone pitches in to help.\n\nNot sure how difficult the cycle would be to break if it's cultural. My situation was more American generational. \n\nBut do you want your future daughter to get that message that women serve while men get served?", "NAH\n\nThey can expect you to behave a certain way when you visit. It's their house after all. You can however choose not to visit if their rules compromise your values too much. You leaving actually was the perfect solution. \n\nIf they want you to visit again and help out then they have got to leave you at least enough room to manoeuvre to do it in your own time. You don't have children yet, please make all the use you can of the glory years of sleeping in. Even if you decide not to have children, please enjoy the glory of sleeping in. Sleeping in is glorious and is definitely not something I'd be willing to compromise on.

It is no longer working, so may need to be re-evaluated. Maybe you staying a hotel, maybe you do not visit every time (or at all), etc. \n\nHowever, stay strong. This will set a lot of precedents for you and your spouse, including how he responds to changing events in your life/house (i.e., potential kids) especially when his mother speaks up on those topics.", "Then stop going. He wants you to respect you're under their roof, don't be there", "NTA - Tell MIL that this the 21st century and she needs to get with the times.  Down with the patriarchy and that you are a liberated woman and she should be too.  Then have her sit with you and make your FIL serve you a couple of wines.", "NTA. \n\nYes, I think you can absolutely wake up early to help your MIL when you stay with them, but your husband should also be doing that and you aren't staying with them because you want to, but because they want you to stay. \n\nWhen I visit my parents, I do all sorts of things I don't really enjoy on my own free time- help cut down a tree or patch a roof, wake up way earlier, eat dinner at 4pm- but I do WANT to visit my parents. And the fact that your husband is not expected to help makes it feel icky. He wants you to compromise for his parents, and you already have by going to visit and stay with them. \n\nYou absolutely should respect his parents when under their roof, and he should respect you under any roof, and you don't need to be under their roof, so you got out.", "When it's part of the culture and you are absolutely not going to subscribe to it, then you shouldn't stay with them.  If you are coming to stay with them occasionally to offset you not living there after marriage, but to still appease the culture, you have to go the whole way.  Being a guest in their home and making more work isn't why you are supposed to be there.   If you just want to visit, then stay at a hotel. If you choose to stay with them, suck it up and do what you claim you are there for.", "NTA\n\nThis is a complicated situation because you and your mother in law both value very different things. Your mother in law measures your respect and maybe even love for her by this act of cleaning and waiting on the men of the family. It\u2019s her idea of what a good, loving wife does. It is pretty old fashioned and out of date ( as well as sexist), but she probably won\u2019t change much if at all. Unfortunately it puts your husband in an uncomfortable spot between the two of you, which sucks. The only advice I can offer is that you all should communicate and say how you feel to each other. Then, come up a compromise and lay out expectations to each other. Once you create a good compromise, then do what you can to hold up your end of the bargain. Hopefully there can be a middle ground between you and your mother in law.", "it's kind of like u'r stuck btw a rock and a hard place. \n\nWhen it comes to whether ur the A-hole or not, opinions may vary. Some mite think you were being disrespectful while others might argue you were standing up for urself. Personally, i think it's kinda a mix of both. \n\nMoving forward, it might be helpful to have an open conv with ur husband about what u feel comfortable doing and find a balance that works for both of u. It's also important to make sure your MIL understands that you respect her, even if you dnt fully follow her traditions. \n\nDon't beat yourself up too much okay? Every situation has room for learning and growth, and this one's not an exception.", "I would stop going. Period. NTA but some families are stuck on their traditions and won\u2019t change. If you won\u2019t change either (fair) I suppose your marriage is doomed.", "I despise old-fashioned sexist cultures that strive to keep women passive and submissive to husbands and families. It's 2023. Women are equal and deserve better treatment than what was given and are still done to us. It might be time to pull back if his family keeps forcing this.

I understand the feeling of sleeping late (believe me, we all do) however, also a sign of respect for your in-laws at their home in regardless if you want to or your husband helps you, you need to follow their rules.\nOn the other hand, how is your MIL when they visit your home?", "NTA - I woudn't go along with that patriarchal bullshit and your husband sucks", "At that point I no longer stay there. \n\nNTA", "Stupid stupid traditions!!!!!", "Don't visit them for a month or two.", "NTA. Your husband slid right on back into the 1950s. \n\nIt is great to help family. If you want to help, then next time you go, ask what is on the chore schedule and do it the night before bed (this, only if you feel that participating in their family structure is what you want).", "NTA-", "And dismantling patriarchal systems has to start with someone refusing to uphold them. And her husband owes her a massive apology.", "They're technically her customs aswell she just doesn't like them and he said he didn't care bout them either (clearly a lie)", "Or just let hubby go on his own to visit them. Why spend PTO visiting people that frankly sound miserable to be around? Especially if MIL is bitter that they didn\u2019t move in with them.", "Are you reading that they compromised to stay over a few days since they\u2019re expected to live with them after. It doesn\u2019t sound like OP needs to rent a hotel (as in she lives out of town). She can just stay at home", "The text kind of said they did talk about it and see each other as equals, even deviding everything 50/50", "Disagree.\n\nHIS family, HIS crazy, HIS responsibility to put his own mother into her place.", "No kids. That's the plan and agreement. So that's one battle I am still gonna have to fight. Impending drama alert.", "I respectfully do not agree with the their house their rules mantra. I think the question is: is the rule ridiculous? Not do they have the right to implement the rule because it is their house. \n\nAs for the husband, I think he\u2019s playing chicken and trying to appease all parties when he should be standing up for her, especially since she made it clear from the beginning that she did not want to engage in these traditions. The least he can do is support her, not bait and switch.", "\ud83d\ude02 imagine", "This. MIL house, MIL rules. Dont stay there and you can follow your own rules.\n\nHusband needs to calm down too. I get he doesnt want to upset his mother, but there are better ways to talk about this issue with OP, specially if he is not the one who has to get up at 6H30.", "Exactly. Compromise all the way, or don't compromise at all.", "The husband is not stuck in between, no one is ever stuck in between, he is a person and he can make up his mind by himself", "If she doesn\u2019t want to go stay with the in-laws every month to get up early and do chores, how is she in the slightest bit wrong for that?? The in-laws seem to want to make her change and conform to their culture (horribly outdated in my opinion) which is completely unnecessary and just plain controlling. OP, you have one life to live and it\u2019s a short one. Don\u2019t waste a single minute more catering to closed minded people who are slower and more stubborn to being fair and enlightened. You can be respectful and cordial without bending to their will", "How is it doomed if she doesn't change?", "From a comment, it\u2019s not just a few times a year, it\u2019s every other weekend. She said that it feels like she\u2019s working 12 days a fortnight with no overtime pay.", "If you add INFO to your post, she sees it quicker", "Yes and yes. I know this is custom. I told both him and his parents I won't do it. He said he would never force me to. His parents said they would never interfere in our relationship \ud83d\ude02\n\nGot married. They let me be for a while. Our initial arrangement was I won't visit. But then they started calling me and inviting me to visit. To see me. For family functions etc. I discussed it with my husband, he said its just a few days in a year, just let them get their fill. I started compromising over festivals, that I could spend 2 days there. It escalated into them telling me how I visit only for festival, all the guilt trips, from both his family and mine, made me say yes, I will visit a couple of days. \n\nBut these 2 days are literally Saturday and Sunday. We go there on Friday evening and travel back Sunday night. These are my only off days between two work weeks. It's exhausting to get up even at 9 am. If I was at our home or my parents place, i wouldn't bother getting up till 12 noon or later. Getting up at 6 am is like asking me to work overtime in 12 day work week.", "Women all over the world have to continue to cook and clean and do laundry until their deaths, long after retirement age. If MIL can get all her chores done in 3 hours per day, that\u2019s hardly arduous. OP\u2019s life reads like this: work full time, contribute to half the chores at home, drive to in-laws every Friday-Sunday, get up early on these days, her normal days off, and help MIL do chores which sounds like the only job MIL has, drive home and go back to work full time. When is OP getting a break, and why is husband not backing her up?\n\nI do think visitors should pitch in, expecting them to get up early and be a servant is out of bounds.", "This is a really good explanation and knowing this I think OP should be helping out.", "It sounds more like she agreed to these long visits because the parents wanted them as a compromise for not living with them. That's not fully her choosing stuff", "Jesus I wouldn't waste an ounce of respect where I'm clearly not given the same", "No.", "I think you missed the part where she is forced to stay at their house and it wasn't because she wanted to actually spend time there", "If the husband was prepared to help out at 6am, then you would be AH.  If he\u2019s not, NTA.  \n\nYou should be prepared to help out though.", "I don't get what these people don't understand about compromise. She agreed to stay at her MIL's a few days a month full well knowing what's expected of her and then she's going to act all feminist about it? No one's saying she's a slave. At least no more so than the MIL.", "Oh wait it's who's house? Right not her responsibility", "Their house, their rules. That's why she left. She has the right to choose her batles. It is her life.", "Oh please this is so ridiculous", "Are they though? She has denounced them and that's it, no longer hers.", "If the plan is no kids, make sure MIL and hubby wont sabotage that. Birth control, vasectomy or protected sex only. You dont want to end up babytrapped (i dont know your views on abortion or access to care) and forced into the role you made clear you never wanted.", "Well that\u2019s good, so at least that\u2019s one battle you won\u2019t have to fight. But the rhetorical point about raising daughters in an environment where this shit is expected of them still stands.\n\nThe people on this thread wringing their hands and going \u201cbut their culture, but their house\u201d are crazy IMO. I don\u2019t GAF about their culture or their house, that doesn\u2019t give them the right to enslave me at 6am because I have a vagina. F that noise.", "Keep this reaction in mind as you let his parents know that y'all don't want kids. \ud83c\udf1d He's caving to their pressure here so... But NTA.", "She could just, you know, choose not to stay with them.", ">He said he would never force me to.\n\n...\n\nso that was a lie, wasn't it. Because now he expects you to do it as \"the least you can do\". \n\nThis needs to be seriously addressed with your husband. Obviously the \"compromise\" is no longer working out, and you may have to limit visits to his parents.\n\nSpending all weekend every weekend with his parents IS too much to ask. It's a ridiculous expectation, and I'm side-eyeing your husband SO hard right now, because his spine seems to be made from jelly. Not uncommon in this type of situation, and obviously he feels irritated at YOU because HE is affected only positively by you being enslaved and forced into submission.\n\nVery worrying. He seems to have forgotten the mom that you are an equal, EVEN WHILE inside his parents' house. Your freedom IS NOT conditional on your location.", "Definitely NTA, you told them you wouldn\u2019t participate and they agreed so why should you be expected to give up your only time off to help clean someone else\u2019s house?", "I dont think mil gets all her daily chores done in 3hrs.  I think that was just the morning chores that are finished before OP awakes.\n\nI dont think it should be expected for a guest to get up early and be a servant. \n\n But i do think OP getting up early once a month to help would go a.long way towards building bridges with her in laws and would show she cares for her MIL and wants to help her with things so they can spend quality time together unrelated to chores", "Thank you for understanding.  Dont understand the downvotes.  I was just trying to get op to see that her mil is like a drowning person who is just asking for a bit of help. \n\n And out of compassion for her MIL's circumstances in life, sacrificing an hour or two of sleep once a month would not be harmful to OP and would greatly help her mil.", "She\u2019s a grown woman. She can choose for herself what she wants to do. The in-laws didn\u2019t force her to come.", "At gunpoint?", "And? Her life is her life, their lives are their lives. She's come here asking if she's the A-hole and I'm giving my take on it based on the info she's provided. They didn't hide their expectations of her or spring anything sudden on her. She knew full well what she was getting herself into when she said she'd compromise. When you marry, you marry into a whole new family, not just your spouse. They're not asking for anything particularly horrid of her, other than to get up a couple of hours earlier than to her liking a few days a month.", "Oh that's it, you convinced me.", "Exactly, not her customs, some people in her culture still practice these customs, some don\u2019t, she\u2019s one of the ones that don\u2019t, so is her husband unless he\u2019s with his parents. Her husband likes having a modern wife that works and pays the bills unless he\u2019s back with his parents, then he wants a traditional housewife to serve his manliness And appease his parents.", "Which is exactly what she did", "Downvotes don't bother me.  :)", "oh guess I missed the part where you're only forced if it's at gunpoint", "The compromise she makes is to visite them quite often. The first times they didn't say anything, it set the tone. Now her IL try to ask for more and she is not ok. She is right to stand for herself.", "Sounds more like he doesn't want to deal with his mother and is taking the easy way to shut her up. That makes him a spineless asshole.", "I mean, eventually, but she should\u2019ve never stayed with them in the first place if she wasn\u2019t going to go along with the cultural norms. She knew what would be expected of her if she stayed and chose to stay with her in-laws anyways.", "The downvote itself doesn't bother me, but rather the thought process that has led to it.  Especially when in response for advocating for someone who is in need of compassion and assistance, and when i said nothing negative about OP.   People can be very cold and think only of themselves so i was trying to offer thoughts could allow someone to better understand the MILs request for help.", "If she doesn't have to go, its not forced. She chooses to go and should act like an adult while she's there.", "The first times they didn't say anything because they were giving her a chance to get into the regime of things in their household. When they saw that she wasn't taking to it, that's when they spoke up. She indicated that she was very aware from the get-go that doing house chores was expected of her. Below are snippets of her post indicating this:\n\n\"It is again customary, DIL helps MIL with household tasks (The stench of patriarchy)\"\n\n\"When I am visiting I am expected to help her with the chores. Not my husband, just me.\"\n\nSo why does she get all cut when they finally voice their displeasure? She KNEW this. They already compromised when they agreed to let their son and DIL live separately. It makes me wonder to what extent they actually discussed general living arrangements with her in-laws prior to her getting married. Not just about her doing house-chores, but also discussing their personal and cultural values, because it sounds like it wasn't thoroughly fleshed out on either side, and now they are having these sorts of issues as a result. If she can hardly handle something as simple as this, what will she be like with bigger things?", "I think that you did a great job of explaining how the situation could, because it's clearly in a culture which I know I definitely don't have any experience (and I would imagine many people also don't) but as a result of this, your post does add necessary information to the situation. \n\nIf the OP is read and understood within the context of the culture people are used to, where this is not the situation, then that will lead to downvotes, because people are seeing it through the lense of a culture whereby men support their partners. \n\nYour explanation gives information which allows us to see the situation whereby it WOULD be appropriate and kind for OP to support her MIL.   I, personally, willingly help my in laws - when we stay over at family homes I wouldn't dream of just sleeping in and not helping out.  If I understood that my helping out at 5.30am would be beneficial and appreciated I would do it, irrespective of the culture.", "You clearly come from a different culture and therefore lack the knowledge of what being forced is in our culture", "Same."]}
