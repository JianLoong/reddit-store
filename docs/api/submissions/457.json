He\u2019s been doing a certain action \u201chis style\u201d as he puts it but I told him numerous times politely to not do it. He didn\u2019t listen to me, and then I tried to get a little more stern with him and he still didn\u2019t listen. Pile this action with 1-2 others, as well as comments that can pass off as sexual harassment, and you can guess how much little patience I had left for him. He basically shoots photography at weddings for me and I put myself on video. Im already dealing with the fact that the clients and coordinators go to him to give updates assuming he\u2019s the boss when I\u2019m standing right there and also have introduced myself as such beforehand. Rather than redirecting them to me, he\u2019ll basically take charge and make scheduling decisions on my behalf and not even tell me. He has also disrespected me in front of other coworkers and vendors countless times. Maybe he thinks we\u2019re friends because I\u2019m nice to him? Im generally a nice and forgiving leader but I\u2019m stern when I need to be, but his repetitive behavior really ticked me off. Today he called me complaining about why I lowered pay (by 10%) when I had sent a memo a week ago about lowering pay and instead offering bonuses to those who go above and beyond in their work. I asked him if he wanted a performance review, and my frustrations just boiled over through the call and I let him have it. Like really let him have it, I threw a couple \u201cfuckin\u201ds in there out of frustration.

Why are you keeping someone around who is sexist and sending him out to shoot weddings and such? \n\n2. I don't really believe in yelling at employees. Especially going off on them when they complain about pay being lowered. That is a completely valid complaint, even if the guy is a jerk. \n\n3. Lowering everyone's pay and only paying those who \"go above and beyond\" bonuses sucks. Times a thousand.", "YTA for keeping this dude around when he's done everything to prove that he needs to be fired, and also for cutting pay for all employees.", "YTA. You\u2019re by no means ready to give performance reviews if you can\u2019t do so without yelling at someone. You need to remain professional and if it\u2019s as bad as you say it is, you should have fired him long ago.", "YTA - not for yelling at him, but for not terminating him.  He needs to learn his place in the pecking order of the business. Taking initiative in a job is one thing. Undermining your boss, and making decisions beyond your pay grade is another thing entirely.", "YTA. Yelling at an employee is *always* unprofessional. The only time it comes close to being okay is if the employee is in immediate danger (e.g. STOP RIGHT THERE there's an uncovered well in front of you).\n\nHis performance and behaviour is entirely unacceptable but you've let him walk all over you. You should have:\n\n1) corrected his behaviour as it came up - \"I don't care if that is your way, I am your boss and I am telling you to do it this way\".\n\n2) corrected your clients when they approached him - \"Please stop addressing my employee and bring your requests directly to me, despite what he is saying he has no authority to make decisions you're asking him to make and I will not honour his promises from this moment on\".\n\n3) fired him a long time ago.\n\nYou *let* him drive you bonkers because you completely failed to manage him. You want to be the boss? Act like the boss.", "ESH, but it\u2019s not equal suckage.  \n\nFirst of all, if this individual behaves as a sexist with other women, it makes your company look bad. He probably shouldn\u2019t work there to begin with. He sucks because he doesn\u2019t respect his boss, he\u2019s sexist, and he\u2019s directly ignoring what you\u2019ve asked him to do. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re trying to be a good boss and be flexible, but don\u2019t let yourself get walked all over. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have thrown the fuckin\u2019s in there.  It\u2019s not professional and you let your emotions get the better of you.  So here\u2019s why you suck. Nowhere near as much as he sucks, but you kind of suck.", "ESH\n\nSounds like this guy doesn't understand you're in charge and doesn't respect you as a leader so you probably should have given him the ax a while ago.\n\nThat being said, you decided to reduce he and his coworkers' pay by 10% at a time when cost of living is increasing rapidly for a bonus structure that sounds like it is based on your personal whim instead of a definable metric.  With that in mind, he and his peers should quit.", "[removed]", "[deleted]", "YTA for this:\n\n> He basically shoots photography at weddings for me and I put myself on video.\n\nWTF is that... me and I put myself....\n\n>  He has also disrespected me...\n\nholy shit.  Anyone worried about someone 'disrespected me...'.  Everytime.\n\n>  the clients and coordinators go to him to give updates ....\n\nOkay... what is the problem.  You own... correct?  \n\nLook.  You got this staff.  You got this person who you don't like that apparently works closely with the clients and they are comfortable talking to - let him do it.  They go to him, he works stuff out with you.\n\nThat is what salespeople do.  They interface between the client and managment.\n\nBut you- you are too insecure about yourself for this shit.\n\nYou sound like a real peach to work for.\n\n> Im generally a nice and forgiving leader\n\nHoly shit, no one is believing that!  I promise you every one of your staff has a lot to say when you are not in the room.\n\n> I had sent a memo a week ago about lowering pay and instead offering bonuses to those who go above and beyond in their work.\n\nHoly shit.  Just redefine jobs.  So everyone gets a paycut instead of people who do too much work - those people get normal pay.  No bonus for you!\n\nYeah you are a real peach.  \n\nNo one likes you.\n\nThey are all plotting to leave.", "NTA. But:\n\n>I'm stern when I need to be\n\nNot stern enough, in my opinion.", "NTA. Can you terminate him? You have cause with the sexual/sexist comments and insubordination. Type up a quick notice/performance plan and can him next time he crosses the line.", "ESH.  Yes he sounds like a terrible employee.  But you sound like a terrible boss.  Have you ever been around a little kid behaving badly and the parent just keeps saying \u201cstop it\u201d or making empty threats of punishment but they actually never escalate the warnings or carry through on the threats? To bystanders watching, the only thing more annoying than the misbehaving child is the ineffective and enabling parent.  You are that parent.\n\nIf you are going to manage people and you have no management skills, then go get some.
