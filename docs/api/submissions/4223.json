I would never co-sign anything for an adult child, let alone one who has no stable employment, clearly hates me, and hasn\u2019t even asked for the favor herself.\n\nHowever, you and your wife should help her escape the abusive relationship and get someplace safe.

Not worth the risk of crumbling said rock for someone who shows fairly poor judgement and doesn\u2019t respect you.", "NTA, co-signing for someone is a huge financial burden.

It's totally reasonable that you would not do this for someone who won't even have a decent conversation with you.  I'm not understanding why daughter's only way out has to be a private apartment that she can't afford to pay for.  If her mother wants to help, perhaps assist her with finding a roommate to share space and expenses.  Put her in touch with the local domestic violence support groups and she might find someone there.  Does she have any skills or education? Is she even trying to get a job?  Daughter needs to be part of the solution and work on making her own security here instead of just waiting for you and Mom to bail her out and carry her around.", "INFO: Can you afford the apartment for your step-daughter, and is your refusal to co-sign just a matter of principle, or would the rent on the apartment that would allow your step-daughter to leave her abusive boyfriend be a significant financial burden on you?", "NTA. I would not tell the wife it's because daughter doesn't like you, that does nothing to cool off the conversation.\n\nNot being willing to co-sign for anyone under any circumstances is a hard boundary. It's all the reason you need to give.\n\nPersonally, keep in mind that you would also be co-signing for the boyfriend. That said, the more reasons you give, the more she will want to argue with you. Keep it simple.", "NAH. \nThe daughter hasn't even asked so she can't be anAh. Mom is desperate for her child to be out an an abusive situation and that doesn't make her an AH either", "I understand not cosigning for her, but surely there's a compromise to be reached. Maybe you could buy an apartment and rent it to her, with a proper lease agreement, so that she has somewhere to live and gets a rental history?\n\nWhile cosigning is not the smart thing to do, your wife is seeing her daughter struggle while her husband who can afford to help does nothing.

I mean I understand that the daughter's life isn't technically your responsibility, and it sucks that she's not a very warmer kind towards you or her mother . But I mean she's also had a pretty rough life right? And it seems like trying to stop repeating that pattern. the daughter would be less crusty to everybody if she got a break.\n\nYTA for not helping this young woman out.\n\n If you were just starting to build your credit score, or not fair financially stable it would understand your position better but you said you've done well for yourself, I'm assuming the daughter isn't looking for a luxury apartment. The risk is pretty low to you as a cosigner in this situation. If she defaults on the rent it seems like you'd be able to cover it without any real injury, and of course and then break the lease.", "I assume the ex-husband bankrupting her played a factor.", "They would not be cosigning for the boyfriend.

That being said, there are ways that can help which should be explored, but people don't get to be financially successful by making bad financial decisions.", "Yes, but will the boyfriend stay gotten away from?

There is a very real risk that Dangerois is correct.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Nta. Do not cosign for anyone. This is someone that won't even acknowledge your existence - how motivated do you think she would be to make sure you don't end up having to pay for her rent?

Do NOT do this. It\u2019ll come back to bite you.", "My father cosigned for me once. I was trying to escape an abusive household as well.\n\nThe difference between me and your step daughter?\nI was 18 years old with no credit at all. The house I was escaping was my mother's (his ex-wife's). I am close to him at the time we spoke atleast once a week with the minimum conversation being 20 minutes. We still talk the same amount.\n\nBut when I asked him if he would we had several conversations. About needing to have the full amount  of rent not just my portion (i had 2 roomates) Including getting it in writing that if he ever had to pay (without knowledge i.e. me asking bc I was short) he would A) give me 48hrs to pack my shit B) pay for my lease to be broken C) make me move in with him and D) I would have to pay him back with interest for everything.\n\nHe was harsh about it, cold and to the point. Knowing I had consequences was scary as hell. But guess what I never missed a payment. He helped me build my credit so that he could be taken off the lease.\n\nYou barely know that girl, you know the dangers of cosigning. I was going to college and held down a 30hr a week job I had steady income. If I hadn't spoken to him in years? He would have sent me links to DV websites that offer help with housing. \n\nSo OP take a page out of his book and had your wife a few resources to help her but do not put your life at risk.\nOffer food, some cash for gas, bu make her learn to stand on her own two feet.\n\nNTA", "NO\n\nIt's kind of laughable asking an accountant to cosign anything.  We all know that it never works out and to ask a numbers man to cosign?", "I have done well for myself but I can\u2019t buy an apartment. Also this isn\u2019t an apartment in the Midwest somewhere it\u2019s on the east coast. She is looking at New York City and  Jersey City.\n\nThe relationship is abusive. Not physically but not a good situation. We have tried to give her alternatives but she wants her own place as to not get in this \u201cbad roommate\u201d situation again.\n\nIn NY or Jersey you have to make 40x the rent to qualify (80x as guarantor) so it\u2019s not as simple as giving her a deposit.", "NTA --- If it'd that important to your wife then she should co-sign the daughter's loan.", "NTA, I have two grown children I love dearly and would not dream of cosigning under any circumstances. \n\nOne flooded toilet, or forgotten skillet on the stove and you could be in debt up to your eyeballs.", "YTA", "NTA, this person (stepchild) has no semblance of a relationship with you.\n\nThe fact that she is your wife's daughter is irrelevant. \n\nI would not cosign!", "Oh god I didn\u2019t even know that about the rent situation there, that sounds kind of unreasonable.

I can totally understand that your wife is desperate to help prevent her daughter from homelessness & also your reluctance to help.\n\nGenerally speaking, homelessness is very difficult to escape & it\u2019s easy to go even further downhill. So there has to be another way you can help? I\u2019m not American so I don\u2019t know if the services available but I would be looking at getting her connected with a domestic violence shelter or service with support workers to help her get on her feet again (abuse doesn\u2019t have to be physical & coercive control is a huge thing!) \n\nAnother possibility, (& I appreciate that you\u2019ll hate it) is to allow her a set time to stay with you on strict conditions that she seek therapy, get a job & actively work towards leaving - an option of last resort of course!\n\nWhatever you choose to do, I think for your relationship\u2019s sake with your wife, you need to be proactive in helping in some form or she will see you as the man who made her daughter homeless. No it wouldn\u2019t be fair, it\u2019s her daughter\u2019s doing but her mama bear is coming out & she is in fear for her daughter. \n\nI ask that you look into the local services, perhaps try to find her a live in job? Show your wife that you care about her fears & are actively trying to find solutions so that everyone is ok.\n\nAt the end of the day though, some people cannot be saved, it\u2019s the daughter\u2019s choice & you can only provide suggestions - best of luck!", "NTA. Is there any other way you'd willing to help? Some places just require a larger deposit to offset the bad credit. Would your wife be able to help them with the deposit?", "Chile pls.

Surely she should have a say in how they use their money?", "As I said, there are other options & that would be a last resort. Please re-read the entirety of my comment & understand that I\u2019m trying to help you", "Is there a way you can help her out without co signing.\n\nFor example what if you buy a condo in your wife and your name and charge her rent?\n\nThis means she is in safe space but you get to have an investment that you can eventually sell?\n\nI realize she is rude but she is your wife\u2019s daughter and in a bad situation.", "NTA. She can ask someone that she actually has a good relationship with for help, not her mothers husband.  She was already grown when you came into the picture so I understand not being a father figure, but to be openly hostile and expect that amount of help is way too much", "NTA you already know you don't cosign for anyone.", "ESH I get your reasoning for not wanting to help her because she doesn't treat you well. The problem is that I'll never support \"I know someone is getting abused and I could help but won't\". I mean let it melt on your tongue. That's what you're saying.", "NTA. Sit down with your wife. Gently explain that co-signing means you would be legally responsible for paying the rent if stepdaughter for whatever reason stopped paying, which seems likely due to the lack of stable employment. Point out that as a retired person, you don't have a lot of wiggle room when it comes to money. Paying her rent would impact your ability to cover your personal expenses as well your shared expenses. It might be better for her to find a roommate situation for 12 months. She can use that time to start working on her credit score and keeping a job.", "Do not do it, she hates your ass and will deliberately and maliciously fuck your credit as sure as the sky is blue.  And your wife is deluding herself if she thinks anything else is going to happen.  NTA.\n\nEdit: add sentence", "Then your step daughter needs to learn to make concessions, like a change of location or a roommate. \n\nI can understand that your wife is desperate to get her out of a bad situation, but what her daughter is asking (via her mother) for is too much. Your wife is being inconsiderate as well.\n\nFirst and last month's is a huge help and something that could help her move on with her life. Many people don't get that. Honestly,  that would be as far as I go.\n\nInfo: what is your wife's response to how her daughter treats you?\n\nEdit: spelling", "It doesn't sound like she's ever really done anything wrong to OP though. Still agree that he doesn't owe her anything. Yet the girl watched her brother get all these opportunities and when it came to her turn there was nothing. OP hasn't done anything to be treated better than how she treats her own mother, and ignoring some you don't like is honestly reasonable for things not necessary.", "He said they are doing well for themselves and honestly if he has to help her it would mean eventually he can get his money back (sell the place)", "Doing well for your self in Montana is very different than doing well for yourself in NY or Miami", "I take doing well for self as in whatever area you are in. Look it\u2019s not a bad idea if you can afford it because you get your money back.", "Info: why cant your wife cosign?", "NTA.", "NTA. Co-signing never goes well!

Nope, not your circus, not your monkeys.", "NTA. My uncle did this (cosign) and the family member in question simply abandoned the apartment, didn't pay the bills and sold all the furniture, he had bought for it.

Co-signing should only be done if you intend to pay it yourself.  Offer cash you don\u2019t expect to get back instead (though I personally don\u2019t give anything to people who don\u2019t like me\u2026.rather give it to a stranger walking down the street)", "Don\u2019t co sign but if you\u2019ve got the disposable income as a gesture of goodwill you could just pay her first and last month\u2019s rent.

But you can then stress no more.", "Why?", "She'll bankrupt two men then", "Sound like the brothers opportunities were merit based he got a sports scholarship... the daughter could have gotten a scholarship or something too but it sounds like she didn't try", "But this isn't about how they use their money, it's about OP not wanting the liability from cosigning an apartment to be on him."]}
