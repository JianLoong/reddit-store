She should be able to find an income based apartment or even a cheap rental that you could help on a month or two of rent and deposit and not have the liability with co-signing.", "NTA.  I would never co-sign anything for an adult child, let alone one who has no stable employment, clearly hates me, and hasn\u2019t even asked for the favor herself.\n\nHowever, you and your wife should help her escape the abusive relationship and get someplace safe.  INFO:  Has wife\u2019s daughter contacted a domestic abuse hotline?  Where did she live prior to moving in with her BF?", "Why can\u2019t your wife co-sign?", "NTA I would say it would be reasonable to help with something like a deposit or first and last months rent but I would not co-sign and risk her just skipping out on the lease", "NTA\n\nShe can ask her brother.", "NTA \n\nOh hell no!! You don\u2019t do that for your own children who are not financially responsible. Help? Yes, but not co-signing! Don\u2019t ruin your credit", "NTA. But please regardless of your personal feelings towards her and hers towards you, try and get her somewhere safe/away from the abuser.", "NTA", "NTA. Even if she asked herself and you had a healthy relationship, it\u2019s not crazy you\u2019d say no. Leaving an abusive ex is also hard - there\u2019s truly no guarantee that relationship ends when she gets keys to a new place. It\u2019s a possibility you\u2019re now financially on the hook for a financially irresponsible couple, half of which seems capable of causing damages. Finally, if your wife isn\u2019t financially solid, you are the only rock here. Not worth the risk of crumbling said rock for someone who shows fairly poor judgement and doesn\u2019t respect you.", "NTA, co-signing for someone is a huge financial burden. Doing so for someone that has no real relation to you and outright doesn't like you is just ridiculous. \n\nI would voice that with your wife and explain to her your relationship you have with her daughter and how she has never made an attempt to establish one with you.", "NTA - you are right on point that cosigning would be the first step on the road to a potential disaster.  It's totally reasonable that you would not do this for someone who won't even have a decent conversation with you.  I'm not understanding why daughter's only way out has to be a private apartment that she can't afford to pay for.  If her mother wants to help, perhaps assist her with finding a roommate to share space and expenses.  Put her in touch with the local domestic violence support groups and she might find someone there.  Does she have any skills or education? Is she even trying to get a job?  Daughter needs to be part of the solution and work on making her own security here instead of just waiting for you and Mom to bail her out and carry her around.", "INFO: Can you afford the apartment for your step-daughter, and is your refusal to co-sign just a matter of principle, or would the rent on the apartment that would allow your step-daughter to leave her abusive boyfriend be a significant financial burden on you?", "NTA. I would not tell the wife it's because daughter doesn't like you, that does nothing to cool off the conversation.\n\nNot being willing to co-sign for anyone under any circumstances is a hard boundary. It's all the reason you need to give.\n\nPersonally, keep in mind that you would also be co-signing for the boyfriend. That said, the more reasons you give, the more she will want to argue with you. Keep it simple.", "NAH. \nThe daughter hasn't even asked so she can't be anAh. Mom is desperate for her child to be out an an abusive situation and that doesn't make her an AH either", "I understand not cosigning for her, but surely there's a compromise to be reached. Maybe you could buy an apartment and rent it to her, with a proper lease agreement, so that she has somewhere to live and gets a rental history?\n\nWhile cosigning is not the smart thing to do, your wife is seeing her daughter struggle while her husband who can afford to help does nothing. You need to find a way to help so she can see that you're willing to help, yknow?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She hasn't asked, doesn't deserve and doesn't sound financially stable nor responsible....", "NTA at all do not do it", "You\u2019re NTA, and it wouldn\u2019t be your fault if she were to eventually become homeless. I feel for you, you\u2019re in a difficult spot and there likely just isn\u2019t an decent solution to be had. Perhaps if she contacted local DV organizations they could help her find housing? They will likely recognize there are many kinds of abuse even if it\u2019s not physical and help her all they can", "You're just being asked to co-sign for a person to get out of an abusive relationship, and you're being salty about it. I mean I understand that the daughter's life isn't technically your responsibility, and it sucks that she's not a very warmer kind towards you or her mother . But I mean she's also had a pretty rough life right? And it seems like trying to stop repeating that pattern. the daughter would be less crusty to everybody if she got a break.\n\nYTA for not helping this young woman out.\n\n If you were just starting to build your credit score, or not fair financially stable it would understand your position better but you said you've done well for yourself, I'm assuming the daughter isn't looking for a luxury apartment. The risk is pretty low to you as a cosigner in this situation. If she defaults on the rent it seems like you'd be able to cover it without any real injury, and of course and then break the lease.", "I assume the ex-husband bankrupting her played a factor.", "They would not be cosigning for the boyfriend.

If she defaults on the rent it seems like you'd be able to cover it without any real injury\n\nShow me where OP says they can afford to subsidize someone else's lack of responsibility. He's financially smart, doesn't mean he's wealthy enough to finance two households when the daughter hasn't even asked for the favor herself", "There are other alternatives than the OP having to fund a second household.  And in these financial times, that's not a very smart move.  That being said, there are ways that can help which should be explored, but people don't get to be financially successful by making bad financial decisions.", "Yes, but will the boyfriend stay gotten away from?  One of the sad things about these abusive situations is how often the victims return to them or let their abusers back into their lives.  There is a very real risk that Dangerois is correct.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Nta. Do not cosign for anyone. This is someone that won't even acknowledge your existence - how motivated do you think she would be to make sure you don't end up having to pay for her rent? Or sucks that she was in an abusive relationship and of course her mother wants to help her. But you and your wife will end up arguing every time the daughter doesn't pay her rent.", "NTA. Do NOT do this. It\u2019ll come back to bite you.", "My father cosigned for me once. I was trying to escape an abusive household as well.\n\nThe difference between me and your step daughter?\nI was 18 years old with no credit at all. The house I was escaping was my mother's (his ex-wife's). I am close to him at the time we spoke atleast once a week with the minimum conversation being 20 minutes. We still talk the same amount.\n\nBut when I asked him if he would we had several conversations. About needing to have the full amount  of rent not just my portion (i had 2 roomates) Including getting it in writing that if he ever had to pay (without knowledge i.e. me asking bc I was short) he would A) give me 48hrs to pack my shit B) pay for my lease to be broken C) make me move in with him and D) I would have to pay him back with interest for everything.\n\nHe was harsh about it, cold and to the point. Knowing I had consequences was scary as hell. But guess what I never missed a payment. He helped me build my credit so that he could be taken off the lease.\n\nYou barely know that girl, you know the dangers of cosigning. I was going to college and held down a 30hr a week job I had steady income. If I hadn't spoken to him in years? He would have sent me links to DV websites that offer help with housing. \n\nSo OP take a page out of his book and had your wife a few resources to help her but do not put your life at risk.\nOffer food, some cash for gas, bu make her learn to stand on her own two feet.\n\nNTA", "NO\n\nIt's kind of laughable asking an accountant to cosign anything.  We all know that it never works out and to ask a numbers man to cosign?", "I have done well for myself but I can\u2019t buy an apartment. Also this isn\u2019t an apartment in the Midwest somewhere it\u2019s on the east coast. She is looking at New York City and  Jersey City.\n\nThe relationship is abusive. Not physically but not a good situation. We have tried to give her alternatives but she wants her own place as to not get in this \u201cbad roommate\u201d situation again.\n\nIn NY or Jersey you have to make 40x the rent to qualify (80x as guarantor) so it\u2019s not as simple as giving her a deposit.", "NTA --- If it'd that important to your wife then she should co-sign the daughter's loan.", "NTA, I have two grown children I love dearly and would not dream of cosigning under any circumstances. \n\nOne flooded toilet, or forgotten skillet on the stove and you could be in debt up to your eyeballs.", "YTA", "NTA, this person (stepchild) has no semblance of a relationship with you.\n\nThe fact that she is your wife's daughter is irrelevant. \n\nI would not cosign!", "Oh god I didn\u2019t even know that about the rent situation there, that sounds kind of unreasonable. I sincerely hope that she will get the help she needs in order to get out.", "She's not interested in alternatives... entitled af.\n\nYou're at least trying and she isn't, NTA."]}
