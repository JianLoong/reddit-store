My fianc\u00e9e and I don\u2019t want a huge traditional ceremony, so we\u2019re planning a small, intimate wedding in a botanic garden. My sister and her fianc\u00e9 want a bigger, fancier wedding. \n\nWe announced the date of our wedding 3 months ago, then last week my sister announced the date of hers, which was the same date. I assumed she\u2019d just forgotten it was the date of my wedding, but when I asked her about it it was clear she hadn\u2019t forgotten, she said that there had been a cancellation for that day at her dream venue and she just *had* to take it. She suggested I just change my date, which I refused to do.\n\nShe took it to my parents, and they\u2019re now pressuring me to change the date of my wedding. They agreed it was silly of her to book her wedding on the same day as mine, but they said since it would be easier and cheaper for me to change it, I should just do it. It\u2019s true that it would be cheaper, but easier is debatable, since all my sister has booked currently is the venue, while my fianc\u00e9e and I have already booked everything.\n\nFor a bit of additional context, I\u2019ve always felt like our parents prioritise my sister over me. There have been multiple times we both had an event on and our mum showed up to hers and asked a friend to film mine, but never vice versa. Whenever there was something we couldn\u2019t afford for both of us to do, she was the one who got to do it. Maybe it\u2019s a little childish to bring this stuff up now we\u2019re both fully grown adults, but this situation just brought up all my frustration from before. \n\nThus far I am still refusing to change the date. In my mind, my sister knowingly made a mess, so she can fix it.

Very inconsiderate of your sister to book a date she already knew you had announced 3 months ago. Shame on your parents too.

You say that your sister isn't smart enough but you could see your mother doing things for her, don't count on it. Your sister is undoubtedly smart enough to do those things, she just hides that little tidbit. Do not change your date. Inform any of your family that chooses her wedding over yours, especially if they back out from yours in favor of hers, that you regret they will not be at your wedding and you wish them well. That goes triple for your parents. It honestly sounds like it would not be a great loss, at least on their end, for you to go NC. You might feel the profound loss, but they will still have their golden child. The only difference is that your sister's punching bag (you) will no longer be available to her. You have some petty options, as you mentioned your mother would typically have a friend record your milestones for her, of preventing anyone not in attendance to the wedding from receiving any recordings or photos of your wedding. Basically say only the hired photographer and/or videographer will be allowed to photograph/video the wedding but all attendees will get free access to a one time code should they desire the code. The only problem would be a family member using their code/copy to share with those that didn't attend, but there is likely a way to prevent it from being shared around. Those who know more about that could advise better than I can. Another petty thing would be responding to any family that chooses your sister over you with something like \"oh your daughter's/cousin's/niece's wedding must have been beautiful\" when they try to speak to you about it, all while pulling a \"who are you?\" expression. You could even ask them \"who are you again?\" and basically indicate that they aren't your family since they chose to treat you like you aren't family compared to your sister. Any argument of \"I'm your parent/sibling/aunt/uncle/cousin/etc.\" should be answered with \"if I had any of \\[relation\\] they would have cared enough about me to have supported me during my life, especially milestone events but no-one was there. I must not have family left.\" Now these petty responses will likely badly burn bridges, but it kind of sounds like those bridges may have technically been burnt long ago and only the single rope is providing access.", "NTA\nBut be prepared for a much smaller wedding than you had anticipated and possibly some sabotage if you don't change your plans.

They are gaslighting you", "NTA\n\nWhat you mentioned at the end? That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing now, only bigger.", "Absolutely not", "NTA. Your points are clear, as is the hassle it would be to change your date. How will you feel if you get married and your family isn't there? If your family never gets over it, will it have been worth it? Incidentally, it might well have been worth it to get two households that don't care about you out of your address book.", "NTA. Send out the invitations now. Begore sister can get to it.", "NTA. Make the wedding more intimate by eloping and then go LC/NC with your sister and your parents", "NTA.\n\nKeep your date.\n\nYour wedding crowd just got smaller.\n\nPS - Congratulations!", "NTA. Don\u2019t change it. They can come or not.", "Nta", "NTA. Your parents have a favorite child and it isn\u2019t you. I am sorry they are all AH\u2019s. Tell them once and for all you aren\u2019t changing your date and won\u2019t discuss it any further.", "Talking to your dad about who else could walk you down the isle might really hit him in the feels....", "Her excuse for that was that she apparently had to decide on the spot, or it would be offered to someone else. I\u2019m not sure how true that is because she has a history of lying to make people less mad at her and this sounded exactly like the sort of thing she\u2019d make up.", "This sounds like the sequel to Bride Wars. Definitely NTA.", "My sister isn\u2019t smart enough to do that but honestly I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if my mum did that pretending she was just being considerate and helping me change it since I mentioned how difficult it would be changing the date with the venue and all the vendors.", "I agree. NTA, OP. I\u2019m sorry about your family. Hopefully you and your friends can have a wonderful celebration. All the best to you!", "Agree. NTA. I think this is a great opportunity for OP to marry into a new family and out of their own. The sister seems to have some real narcissism going on that the parents enable.", "Fuck it, pay to have someone object at her wedding for you and have an amazing time at yours while she gets the wedding she deserves (:", "Ooooo I like the way you think. \nEspecially if they\u2019re getting married either in a church or with a priest, I\u2019m fairly certain if someone objects, they legally can not do the paperwork and be married that day. That would be a wonderful sabotage.", "Go to her wedding in your wedding dress. And then object.", "They\u2019ll definitely go to hers instead of mine if they have to choose, and most likely will encourage other family members to do so. I\u2019m honestly so fed up with their behaviour that I wouldn\u2019t even mind that much.", "They\u2019re paying a third of the cost for both, though I expect them to drop any further financial support from mine if I keep refusing to change my date (or even just if my sister\u2019s wedding gets more expensive than expected and she asks for more money). This isn\u2019t a big deal because we can easily afford to lose their financial support.", "This comment made me so happy.", "And include an hourly rate for the time you spend rebooking/canceling everything. Time is money.", "My fianc\u00e9e enquired about availability there, the next openings are 9 months away.", "This is excellent advice. And OP you are NTA here, you booked first. I\u2019d you find it really is a rare opening and consider switching your sis or parents should pay all costs associated with the change", "I\u2019m not having kids so that isn\u2019t a concern here but I see your point.", "It\u2019s in February. Unfortunately that wouldn\u2019t work because an accidental pregnancy is not possible in my relationship, my fianc\u00e9e does not have the equipment required to get me pregnant.", "Oh I won\u2019t be getting pregnant.", "My fianc\u00e9e is being walked down the aisle, not me.", "Yea, that's bullshit.  Anyone would have waited for her to ONE phone call to her sister.", "Okay let's play that threw. She has to decide on the phone. Why didn't she immediately call you? Or offer to pay for your deposit? She doesn't know when your cancelation dates are. If she felt bad she'd call you immediately so you cof make an informed choice. Instead she waited to announce it. Even then she didn't bring up the conflict with you. She just assumed by announcing you'd drop everything and change your date.", "probably more or less true. If she'd asked for an hour to call you they would probably wait, but they want to get that filled asap.   \n\n\nI wouldn't change the date if it was my weeding though. Your sister can back out and tell them she couldn't work it out after all.", "Yeah sounds like she wants one up on you, your parents are jerks and will support her, get ready to not have them at your wedding. Confirm with your family that they are coming to your wedding. Duggestcyou go low contact with your parents.", "Call the venue asking about available dates....since you \"MAY\" be looking!  Then bring receipts...Not that it will matter from the sounds of things, but being right is always fun!\n\n  NTA!", "NTA but you have to decide if you\u2019d rather be right or have your parents at your wedding.", "You wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your mother tried to sabotage your wedding? Why are you still in contact with these people?", "I know you aren't there yet, and I don't want to be pushy, but I think you should really meditate on this situation and the way you were treated growing up. It very much sounds like your sister is the golden child and you are the scapegoat. I think it would be super helpful for you to distance yourself for a while. It will help build clarity.", "Exactly", "Not sure that is true. While a church marriage has religious significance, but legally has no bearing on how the government looks at it. \n\nAs long as they complete the ceremony and the parties and officiant sign the license and submit it to the City/County, they are married. People objecting have no effect on that unless the efficient stops the ceremony.", "Sounds like neither your sister or parents are worth the energy to have a relationship with.  I\u2019m sorry.  \nCongratulations on your wedding and your life!", "Can I ask: If you don't change the date will they pull the money and if so would it make a difference? What does your fiance think about this situation? What did her fiance say about this. How committed are you to keeping this relationship with your family going? Sorry if this is alot to answer at once.", "You're so much better off without those people then", "Send your save the dates out now, just get ahead of her.", "This is truly the best attitude because you're lightening your load and will only have those there that truly want to be and care about You", "I'm sorry your parents are using money to attempt to manipulate you. I would encourage you to decline as much of their financial support as you can, permanently. Is this the first time they have used sided with the sister and tried to manipulate you?", "Nine months is not that far out for wedding planning. How soon is the date you both have planned and when did she claim she booked her date?", "That's an even greater invitation for your parents/sister to abuse your relationship with them and manipulate situations to their favor.\n\n\"well, it's not like you have children to demand your time/attention/money\"", "How about a favorite aunt of fianc\u00e9 who hasn't much time left?", "Then all the more reason to drop the rope and walk away. They will call you childish and unreasonable. Selfish and too sensitive. Keep walking. Tell them they made their choice and now can lavish everything on your sister without worry of scrutiny.", "Ah, nvm then. Sorry your sister is pulling such a transparent power move, and that everyone is blind to it. \n\nIf I were you I'd send out an announcement to all the guests you've invited explaining the situation so guests invited to both can make an informed decision.  Then accept enjoy celebrating with the people who consider you loveable and a worthwhile priority.", "But then she will be blamed for sister losing her dream venue!! The Horror!!!", "My fianc\u00e9e already checked, next available is in August.", "Yeah, this. Your family has made clear that you\u2019re not as valued as you should be. Warn all your vendors to only accept changes from you, not your family members. Then, enjoy your day with your chosen family!", "I understand what your saying, that the two shouldn\u2019t need to be connected. However I don\u2019t think the priest is able to finish the ceremony and therefor won\u2019t sign the paper work. And I know you shouldn\u2019t believe everything you read on the internet, but I had read an AITA a while back where one of the grooms friends objected at his wedding as a prank, and their ceremony had to be stopped. Their officiant wouldn\u2019t do the paper work until 24 hrs later due to the objection. The bride was the one writing, and she was pissed.", "They probably will pull their financial support but since our wedding is not expensive at all it really doesn\u2019t matter. My fianc\u00e9e is supportive of me refusing to change the date but willing to change if I want to, idk how my sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 feels about the whole thing. I don\u2019t actually know if this is worth possibly destroying my relationship with my family over, I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out now.", "February, she booked it last week.", "She's not losing the venue, she just has to wait on the wishlist like everyone else that can't make that date. Such tragedy.", "Sounds like she can get married in August.", "I don't want to be callous but what relationship? Giving you attention only if and when your sister doesn't need/want it?", "You aren\u2019t the one who pulled the trigger and initiated the destruction.  Are you willing to be second best or less the rest of your life? \nYou are worthy of love, respect, and consideration.", "If you do change your date I\u2019d send out save the dates to your family members first and then **very** publicly let everyone know why you have to change your date.\n\nAnd then consider how much you really want these people in your life going forward. Because I can guarantee she\u2019ll always have something on your special days. Your baby shower, well it\u2019s her dogs birthday and that\u2019s *obviously* harder to rearrange. Your kids\u2019 birthdays\u2026. Wouldn\u2019t you know those just always happen to fall on the same day as her Tupperware parties, and you *know* those are notoriously hard to schedule\u2026. \n\nYou will continue to have to put aside your life for her, and eventually any future children you have will have to learn to accept being second class family members too\u2026", "I am sorry, but your relationship was destroyed when your parents asked you to change the date, even though they know the situation. You'll always be a loser if you change the date and never be respected. Just say no and don't argue or give any explanation.", "Sweetie, your family destroyed the relationship,  you didn't. You simply declined to continue to put up with their bullshit. This is at their door.\n\nMay you and your fiance enjoy every happiness together  - with or without these toxic people", "Im sorry but it sucks, but you are allowed to put yourself first especially on your wedding day, you already planned for three months she knew ahead and its going to cost more eventually to change. You deserve to be happy.", "Everyone is different. \n\nBut my experience is - it\u2019ll eventually happen again with a situation where it maybe less obvious to outsiders that you are 100% in the right. \n\nNext time it\u2019ll be something more subtle, where they can manipulate the situation, where it\u2019s not quite obvious and they can change the narrative to make you seem petty or childish or whatever and that will make it so all the extended family/friends think your the issue.\n\nThink about how this may be a moment you look back on with annoyance the next time your sister or parents acts terrible towards you. If you let this go for the sake of keeping the peace, will it really go away? Or will it grow and make smaller slights even more annoying because it\u2019s a build up of anger/mistreatment.", ">I don\u2019t actually know if this is worth possibly destroying my relationship with my family over, I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out now.\n\noh honey, it absolutely is.  \nIts tantamount to being treated as a second class sibling, how much longer are going to accept that? would your potential children and husband also be treated as second to your sisters?  \nI dont mean to sound critical or harsh but these things often are seen in rose tinted glasses and sometimes its not clear.   \nHonestly you sound defeated and know what you have to do, you're just stalling at the final step thats been presented to you.   \nI wish you well and congrats on getting married soon.", "If saying \u201cno actually I\u2019m going to keep my original wedding date and if you guys want to be there you can make it work\u201d destroys the relationship with your family, I hate to say it but it doesn\u2019t sound like there was much relationship there to begin with, at least on their end", "You don't have a relationship with your family worth saving, from the sounds of it.\n\nHow do you benefit from maintaining the relationship? Do they bring joy to your life? Provide emotional support? Have your back?", ">I don\u2019t actually know if this is worth possibly destroying my relationship with my family over\n\nOP, ***THEY'VE*** already made the continued, conscious choice of destroying the relationship.\n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9e have what \\*you\\* need in place. Go forward with it and celebrate with those who truly love you!", "What relationship?", "Holy shit, and she only has the venue? You sure this wedding is actually going to end up happening?", "Exactly this.", "Considering the current dynamics, your children will be second best, less than, never good enough compared  to your sister\u2019s.  Are you willing to acquiesce now and subject your children to this role?", "I\u2019m not having kids so that\u2019s not a concern here but I see your point.", "No potential kids here, and my fianc\u00e9e will be my wife, but I see your point.", "Usually they do, don\u2019t get me wrong they are generally great parents to me\u2026 unless my sister needs something", "I get the feeling vendors here need less notice than in the US, there\u2019s not so much of a culture of booking everything for a wedding 6 months to a year in advance, unless it\u2019s an extremely popular venue. There are some that only require about a month of notice.", "I\u2019m not having kids so that isn\u2019t a consideration here.", "If they are only great parents when there is no outside forces, then they are not great parents. They are parents doing the bare minimum when there's no resistance or pushback. \n\nParents who cannot advocate for their children when someone else is hurting them, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PEOPLE HURTING THEM ARE FAMILY, are not great parents.", "Then it might get even worse if she has kids and you choose not to."]}
