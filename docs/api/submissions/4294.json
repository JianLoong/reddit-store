My fianc\u00e9e and I don\u2019t want a huge traditional ceremony, so we\u2019re planning a small, intimate wedding in a botanic garden. My sister and her fianc\u00e9 want a bigger, fancier wedding. \n\nWe announced the date of our wedding 3 months ago, then last week my sister announced the date of hers, which was the same date. I assumed she\u2019d just forgotten it was the date of my wedding, but when I asked her about it it was clear she hadn\u2019t forgotten, she said that there had been a cancellation for that day at her dream venue and she just *had* to take it. She suggested I just change my date, which I refused to do.\n\nShe took it to my parents, and they\u2019re now pressuring me to change the date of my wedding. They agreed it was silly of her to book her wedding on the same day as mine, but they said since it would be easier and cheaper for me to change it, I should just do it. It\u2019s true that it would be cheaper, but easier is debatable, since all my sister has booked currently is the venue, while my fianc\u00e9e and I have already booked everything.\n\nFor a bit of additional context, I\u2019ve always felt like our parents prioritise my sister over me. There have been multiple times we both had an event on and our mum showed up to hers and asked a friend to film mine, but never vice versa. Whenever there was something we couldn\u2019t afford for both of us to do, she was the one who got to do it. Maybe it\u2019s a little childish to bring this stuff up now we\u2019re both fully grown adults, but this situation just brought up all my frustration from before. \n\nThus far I am still refusing to change the date. In my mind, my sister knowingly made a mess, so she can fix it.

Very inconsiderate of your sister to book a date she already knew you had announced 3 months ago. Shame on your parents too.

You say that your sister isn't smart enough but you could see your mother doing things for her, don't count on it. Your sister is undoubtedly smart enough to do those things, she just hides that little tidbit. Do not change your date. Inform any of your family that chooses her wedding over yours, especially if they back out from yours in favor of hers, that you regret they will not be at your wedding and you wish them well. That goes triple for your parents. It honestly sounds like it would not be a great loss, at least on their end, for you to go NC. You might feel the profound loss, but they will still have their golden child. The only difference is that your sister's punching bag (you) will no longer be available to her. You have some petty options, as you mentioned your mother would typically have a friend record your milestones for her, of preventing anyone not in attendance to the wedding from receiving any recordings or photos of your wedding. Basically say only the hired photographer and/or videographer will be allowed to photograph/video the wedding but all attendees will get free access to a one time code should they desire the code. The only problem would be a family member using their code/copy to share with those that didn't attend, but there is likely a way to prevent it from being shared around. Those who know more about that could advise better than I can. Another petty thing would be responding to any family that chooses your sister over you with something like \"oh your daughter's/cousin's/niece's wedding must have been beautiful\" when they try to speak to you about it, all while pulling a \"who are you?\" expression. You could even ask them \"who are you again?\" and basically indicate that they aren't your family since they chose to treat you like you aren't family compared to your sister. Any argument of \"I'm your parent/sibling/aunt/uncle/cousin/etc.\" should be answered with \"if I had any of \\[relation\\] they would have cared enough about me to have supported me during my life, especially milestone events but no-one was there. I must not have family left.\" Now these petty responses will likely badly burn bridges, but it kind of sounds like those bridges may have technically been burnt long ago and only the single rope is providing access.", "NTA\nBut be prepared for a much smaller wedding than you had anticipated and possibly some sabotage if you don't change your plans.

Your parents don\u2019t.", "NTA, she purposely booked her wedding on the same day so she\u2019s 100% wrong\u2026..so are your parents.\nHave a back up person to \u201cgive you away\u201d or walk yourself down the aisle.\nIf you haven\u2019t done so already, send out the Save The Dates immediately.", "NTA- tell your parents she might be their golden child but she certainly isn't yours!

Hell to the no!!!", "of course NTA\n\nyour sister seems to do this on purpose, I doubt there was a cancellation and there would not have been room at a later time\n\nshe wants to ruin your wedding", "NTA. My heart breaks for you. As a mother, I can\u2019t imagine treating one of my children like this or raising a child that would treat a sibling this way. It\u2019s a major parenting fail. Your parents have made it clear where they stand. No matter what, it sounds like you will always come in second. Even if you give in here, there will be more situations down the road.\n\nI am truly sorry and hope you find peace.", "NTA but if she goes through with this how could you have her in your life? It\u2019s totally bananas that she would do that.", "NTA, in any way. But may I suggest cutting your losses and running off to get married in the most crazy, beautiful destination you can afford? You can have a party with your friends and actual wonderful family later, but I think you might need to consider that going through with your wedding as is, and having family missing, will just remind you of what she's done to you.", "NTA here's an idea, tell your sister you changed your date but make it before your original date and I bet you she's petty enough to change her date to the same day as yours again. But keep your original date and just trick her into changing hers", "NTA\n\nI'm always **exceedingly skeptical** when someone says, \"Oh we couldn't manage any other day except, <important date>, but we trust you'll be ok with it.\" Like, there are 365 days in the year. Even if you only account for weekends that's still in excess of 104 days to choose from. The whole, \"oh but scheduling and junk\" just seems excessively fishy.\n\nAt any rate, if it's a small intimate wedding and you know your parents are going to play favourites than be passive aggressive AF. If they don't show then post images saying, \"good to share this important day with all the people that matter to me in this life,\" or, \"all the people who truly support me.\" Also take their absence as a clear sign of how much equivalent presence they deserve in your potential childrens lives.", "Nta\n\nDon\u2019t you dare cave in! Go on the attack and berate her and your parents for siding with her!", "NTA but since this will cause a huge rupture with your family, I would give it more attention than just saying \"no.\" If you find their behavior to be insulting and part of a pattern of inconsideration, let them know that. Maybe they'll come to their senses. Maybe they'll offer to compensate you two for the change of plans, plus extra for the bother. Maybe they'll gaslight you and act like you're the problem. However that pans out, at least you gave everyone a chance to engage in dialogue about the toxic nature of your relationships, before it all blows up.", "And top it all off with she didn\u2019t even bother to talk to her sister about it before announcing to everyone her wedding date.  You\u2019ve got some family OP. NTA", "NTA\n\nAgree wholeheartedly. I think it doesn\u2019t matter what date the OP had picked for her wedding, the sister would have picked the same day.\n\nSisters behaviour is bad enough, but having her parents try and bully her as well is awful. Sadly, this is probably what OPs life has been like.\n\nDear OP, it sounds like your small intimate wedding got even smaller. You don\u2019t need these AHs in your life.\n\nHave a beautiful wedding day in the day you and your fianc\u00e9 chose.", "I second this!", "\u201cNo.\u201d is a complete sentence.", "My parents have acted like this longer than they\u2019ve known I was bi", "I doubt that, I'm certain she explicitly angled to get her wedding on that day so you'd be married after her, making her wedding the first and 'most special'", "You don\u2019t have to change the wedding date. But you have to be aware that if you don\u2019t your parents will definitely not show up to your wedding", "Call the venue and ask if they filled their cancelation for the date you both now are having weddings on. They will either say yes, say they never had a cancelation for that date, or say they can't tell you but you may have a chance of finding out if she is lying again or not. Then no matter what, tell your parents that they can do what they always do, prioritize your sister. But make sure they know you will have it filmed but you aren't going to give them a copy because being there and supporting you can't be accomplished through watching a video recording. But at least they will have memories of your sisters events to continue to add to. These situations always make me feel petty. Lol", "OP please send this post to her so can see how gross and self absorbed her actions are. More fool your parents for pandering to her selfishness- top parenting there. \n\nNTA.

Your sister will love that.", "Keep your wedding and I guess your sister and parents won\u2019t be coming. (I wouldn\u2019t want them to at this point anyway).

Faking a wedding and asking the free spots they have.", "call the venue and ask...", "NTA and offer to change the date only if they pay for everything. I don't mean just the change fees, I mean those and the entire wedding. If they want you to be inconvenienced for your sisters poor decision making the should compensate you for it.", "An easy way to find out if she was lying about that being the only available date is to call the venue she chose and ask about their availability. It doesn\u2019t solve the overall issue but at least you would know if she was being honest.", "I would be putting this on social media for all of the family to see. Call out your parents if they say they aren\u2019t coming or paying anymore.", "I mean, you could make a public post and see exactly who in your family is worth keeping around.", "Lock down everything with passwords. Your mom is a huge AH.", "Then definitely contact everyone asap and explain you need them to verify you or your fianc\u00e9 via a password.

If not, it's beyond the pale.", "Yes, please lock down your vendors with passwords. Also, do NOT tell your sister the names of anybody you use. She can find her own vendors and not copy you. If you can, get your invitations out as fast as you can to the family who will support you or at least commit on a first come first serve basis.", "Don\u2019t mention how difficult. That give her a way to argue and wheedle. \n\nJust tell her it\u2019s impossible because of the deposits.", "OP, you need to contact your vendors and explain the situation. Explain how selfish your family is and that your mum might try and cancel arrangements to force you to change your date. They need to mark your file that instructions are only taken from you or your fianc\u00e9 and follow this up in writing.\n\nYou don\u2019t need these toxic people in your life. Go NC.", "First off nta but you seem to be in a lose lose situation against the golden child. Get pushed around again and change your wedding date or stand your ground and have a wedding filled with drama. Either way it will be soured. \n\nOr consider this the start of your new life and celebrate with only the people that really care.", "OMG please make sure you lock *everything* down with passwords in case your mother does try it (or your sister finds the gumption to).

The only thing that actually matters is the signing and submission of the marriage certificate.", "When was the last time you heard an officiant ask for objections? You don't have to allow that to be asked. I've been married 12.5 years. It wasn't asked at mine.

It is true that they have to hold everything up for at least 24 hours to investigate the objection. It would end up being expensive for OP and she\u2019d definitely be TA.", "It breaks my heart the more of your comments I read because this is a classic case of babying the younger sibling at the older one's expense. Your sister is used to getting her way and for some twisted reason gets a kick out of your pain. Have you ever taken a stand? Maybe this can be it. You sound like you would be willing to lose the financial support to make a statement. I think you should make it. If you never did before, this could be your chance to refuse to let your sister have her way this time and to let your parents know you are not okay with this arrangement. You have never been.", "OP is also going to have to \"compete\" for those who should be attending her wedding.

It\u2019s probably an defense mechanism by taking the path of least resistance. They\u2019ll continue to do it going forward. What\u2019s next\u2026 change your children\u2019s parties because they conflict with sisters events? They are fully willing to destroy your family relationship, why should you be the one to bend?", "I think the boat might have sailed on that one.  Even if you change your date, you will forever remember that your sister and parents pulled this on you.  You won't feel the same about them again.\n\nAs for their feelings about  you?  I doubt they'll change that much, because they don't seem to care much about you now.", "You might want to consider just not inviting them at all.

They feel perfectly willing to destroy their relationship with you over this. You'd just be obliging them.", "I wouldn't look at this as YOU destroying your relationship with your family but instead a crossroads - either you bow down to this treatment and continue further down the road of passive acceptance (this might happen in the future - with kids etc) OR you make a stand now and live your life prioritizing new values and refocus your real family with your husband.  It might be exactly the change you need.\n\nSometimes these things happen to let go of the energy we need to release to start a new chapter.  If you think you will regret it, then maybe back down but if you think it will make you stronger, go for it!", "I'd still say that it wasn't a legal thing but either that officiant or their church had a rule.

OP, take a moment to look at the relationship you have with your family.  Your sister booked her wedding the same day as yours, months after the fact.  Not by accident.  And YOU are being pressured to change your date.  Don't listen to the shit that \"oh it's easier, your wedding is smaller\", idgaf if that's true, that should never be said to you.  They should be talking to your SISTER! who knowingly booked the same date.  You've chosen their side, and shame on them for it, because it isn't yours.  It's very tough to start to realize the people that are blood family don't necessarily care about you, but that sure as hell doesn't mean you're un-loveable and that you can't find your own family that you choose.  Stout heart OP, you deserve better.", "Yup.  \n\nI don't have the best relationships with my siblings, but for both OP's sister and her parents to actively do this - deliberately try to force OP to change her wedding date just to fuck with her (because that is exactly what this is), boggles my mind.\n\nDoesn't seem like there is much benefit to staying in contact...if they will just use it to continue this extreme favoritism.  What happens when there are grandchildren?  \n\nEasy to state when you're not OP, but this family dynamic, which not only shows no sign of stopping but is actually increasing, looks like a losing proposition for OP.  Time to break the cycle and let things fall out how they may.", "Even if OP were to change the date I could almost see the sister finding a reason to change hers to the new date.\n\nI just get the vibe that the GC can't abide the spotlight being on anyone but her for any reason.", "Not having children, but I get the point.", "Ok I can agree with this. Not a legal thing, but a rule they may have to follow.", "Obviously I\u2019ll get downvoted to oblivion for this, but if you do generally love your parents and want them in you life - even with their flaws, which are not insignificant - then please take the Reddit Scorched Earth default with a grain of salt.

As long as you still consider their presence in your life to be an overall positive, then don\u2019t shut them out. \n\nThat said, I would not change the date. And I would have a serious conversation with your parents to let them know that you\u2019re very hurt by their disregard for you, and that you truly hope they\u2019ll attend your wedding, but given their track record, your sure they\u2019ll choose her over you like always.", "I\u2019ve said to my kids so many times - if they\u2019re a good friend to you 50% of the time they are a bad friend , don\u2019t accept 50% being treated like crap"]}
