I knew some of my coworkers used the bathroom but I couldn't remember who used it last. I took the bra out of the toilet and put it in my room.\n\nThe next day, I sent a text to all the girls who were in my apartment and asked them whose bra it was. A few responded to say it definitely wasn't theirs but not all of them bothered to reply.\n\nAfter two days of no one claiming it, I ended up throwing the bra away. I hate wasting stuff but bra that's been sat in toilet water and god knows what else is one of the things that's got to go in my book.\n\nAround 3 days after I threw it out, my coworker Jan (f26) texted me and said she left her bra at my place and asked if she could come and get it back. I apologised and told her that it had been 5 days and it was sitting in the toilet so I threw it out, but I offered to pay for a replacement. \n\nJan was really mad and told me that she can't get a replacement, as the line she bought it from had been discontinued. I apologised again and said I didn't realise this when I threw it away. Jan called me inconsiderate and said that I was a jerk for throwing it away so soon, and told me to go buy myself some self-awareness.\n\nEdit: i made a typo when I responded to the bot.

I threw away my coworker's bra that she left in my bathroom when drunk\n2. I only waited 5 days for someone to claim it before throwing it out and it wasn't mine.

I would never have offered to pay NTA", "NTA.  She had left it in the toilet!  I honestly would've thrown it away the 1st day I found it.  I would have never taken it to my room... yuck!  Straight to the trash can it is!", "NTA. Jan ought to read her texts. Also, ew! You were a good sport to hold onto it as long as you did.", "NTA.  I would have thrown away the first night and not asked anybody about it.", "NTA. I would have tossed it immediately.", "NTA. I\u2019m a confused man. How does that happen if not on purpose?", "NTA, first off she had to have seen the message and just decided not to text back until she needed the bra, if it was that important she would have told you when you first texted her, and why the hell did she leave her bra at your place and IN THE TOILET in the first place??", "Ewe. Toilet bra. So toilet germs were in your bedroom? I couldn\u2019t, not even in a zip tied plastic puncture-proof bag. Who asks for toilet bra back?!", "Throwing it away so soon? Jan, it's been marinating in toilet water for days, you trash goblin.", "NTA. You gave them the opportunity (so long as you definitely included Jan in the group msg) and she had the chance to msg you then to claim it and make arrangements to grab it. Also, idk about other women but I\u2019d definitely notice if I was missing the bra I\u2019d been wearing at a friends place well before 5 days had passed. Bras are expensive and you can be damned sure I\u2019ve got all my good going out ones accounted for lmao", "NTA. Jan should have kept better track of her bra.", "NTA I get it, we are all idiots when we drink and bras are so dang expensive. But WTF ! She threw her bra in your toilet? And you were generous enough to tell everyone you'd keep it for few days, but if you didn't hear back, it was going in the trash. I honestly would have assumed after a few days that they were embarrassed and no one was going to fess up to the bra. Who gets pissed in this situation? The skanky, low class chick who thinks it's cool to throw their undies in someone's toilet and then get self righteous when they ignore your text. What did they expect? An all out search and rescue team with prized bloodhounds on her scent? You went above and beyond.", "INFO: Was Jan on your text?", "NTA.", "Let\u2019s see. NTA.  And I wouldn\u2019t have offered to help get her a new one. And let it known that from now on any clothing or anything not belonging in a toilet will be trashed immediately once found. Very lucky somebody didn\u2019t attempt to flush. She went 5 days not caring about where it was. She was in the wrong for waiting so long to try to get it. A poop germs and/or pee germy bra needed to be trashed and not growing more gross yuck waiting on an owner. Hazardous material at that point. And not even spending the night there but the bra was taken off. Like why? Was she alone when she took the bra off?", "Hahahahahahahaha.  Did she ever explain WHY she forgot her bra at your house? Or more importantly, WHY DID SHE PUT HER BRA IN YOUR TOILET BEFORE SHE FORGOT IT???\n\nSorry, Jan. You don't put stuff you want to keep in the toilet. That isn't what toilets are for, in fact quite the opposite. You fucked up, Jan. Get over it.\n\nOP you are NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why would she remove her bra and leave it in your bathroom?", "NTA but you really should not have offered to pay for replacement. Someone left something in your toilet and after waiting 5 days you finally threw it out. That was more than generous on your side already.", "NTA- she should\u2019ve responded", "YTA, for making up such a crazy story!\n\nSeriously, who goes to the bathroom and takes their bra off? I mean, I'm a dude, but I can't imagine why you need to take your bra off to pee, or puke, or whatever. Too weird; must be fake.\n\nJ/K, you're NTA. I wouldn't have sent the text. How embarrassing for everybody.", "NAH, but mostly because I don't think it would have hurt to send around one more \"okay, since no one's claimed this thing, I'm going to assume I can just get rid of it if that hasn't changed by tomorrow\" message.  But there *is* a limit to how long you can be expected to hang on to it, even if I personally would've maybe given it a bit longer.  (And you'd think if it's that difficult for Jan to replace, she'd be a little more concerned about having lost it in the first place.)", "Neither would I! I wouldn't have even texted people about it. Maybe I would be an AH in this case. But IMO anything I find in my toilet is clearly unwanted and it needs to go. I would've been mad that I even had to touch something in the toilet to remove it. It would've gone straight into the trash and possibly immediately out to the dumpster if I was unsure if it had been peed on (or anything else).", "That's the part of the story that I really want to know!

Not for any amount of time. \n\nIf I found a bra not soaked in potential pee water, just in my bedroom or whatever, then yes I would hang on to it for quite a while till I figure out who it belonged to.

After that, it's unreasonable to expect you to hold onto it. I do feel her pain about losing a bra you like and isn't made anymore, though!", "Nta...you're better than me because I would have posted it and said its being trashed after all the replies and no replies the same day.....like how drunk was she to leave a bra in the toilet?", "Me too", "I'm a woman and I am equally baffled. I could definitely see taking off a bra and putting it a purse or pocket, and then mayyyybe it falls out, but how in the heck would you not realize it fell into the TOILET?
