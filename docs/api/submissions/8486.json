Her rationale is that abuse and or misbehavior (drinking, drugs, etc.) could happen. This is something she feels very strongly about. It was never a huge issue before the past few years.\n\nOur daughter has a very tight-knit group of friends. Our daughter is best friends with one of the girls (Ella). Ella frequently hosts sleepovers and the other girls attend, but our daughter doesn\u2019t. We compromise by having her go over and then picking her up at about 9 pm, which she dislikes, but it never was a huge issue before.\n\nHowever this past year it got a lot worse.\n\nElla\u2019s parents own a vacation home about 2.5 hours away.

My wife will not change her mind. \n\nSo when my daughter asked me what I thought about the summer trip, I was honest - that I had no issue with it, but her mom was the one who said no. Ever since then their relationship has really deteriorated. Our daughter hates spending time with her and will do anything to avoid it, and frequently snaps and lashes out at her. My wife is in tears several times a week over this. I figured some of this is just our daughter being a teen, but it just seems to be getting worse.\n\nMy wife says I have thrown her under the bus, but I don\u2019t agree.

I'm thinking your wife needs to relax her sphincter a little bit and compromise. Maybe at first, your daughter can go once a month as a trial run. \n\nMaybe she can talk to the parents hosting the sleepover. Will they be there with the girls the whole time?

And it also sounds like your wife may need help here from a therapist because she is doing a huge disservice to your daughter and it seems to stem from an unreasonable paranoia. She is going to cause a huge rift between her and your daughter, not to mention, the mental health damage to your daughter that she is and will continue to experience because she misses out on normal 13 year old girl experiences, will stay with her forever. She will stop getting invited to places eventually, which will alienate her gradually and painfully from the friend group. Breaks my heart honestly.

Did she hear a horror story that has really stuck with her? Did something bad happen to her or someone close to her at a sleepover?\n\nIf your daughter isn't shown some trust and independence soon, you might reach a point of no return and the relationship between your daughter and her mum could become damaged longterm (if it isn't already), and potentially just as bad, your daughter could very easily become underequipped to handle the more complex and dangerous situations that will probably crop up when she's an older teen. The tweenage sleepovers are (imho) kind of essential for helping kids figure out their own boundaries with peers/friends--not to mention closer bonding.\n\nPurely anecdotal, but when I started university, no one partied harder, made more reckless decisions, or called/visited their family less in freshman year than the kids who had just gotten out from a strict, sheltered household.", "NTA your wife needs a therapist.", "NTA.

To detach her daughter from her friends? Be a mama's girl and get made fun of at school? I disagree the \"throwing her under the bus\" accusation, 13 year old is old enough to deserve the truth and honesty. She's crying over her own decisions and was too stubborn to change her ways. This is a recipe for exactly what she fears.", "NTA\n\nYou did not override her and let 13 go anyways. I'm all for a two yes required household with kids, but that doesn't mean the no parent gets to live consequence free if their decision is causing pain and, in this case social, harm.

How should she have compromised to keep you happy? Was picking her up at 9 not good enough? You seem to value how your friends view your wife\u2019s choices more than your wife\u2019s decisions. Your wife could have presented her case better, but I have the same stance as her. In sleepovers you cannot control what other people do with your child, despite the outward persona they want to portray (I think you might be familiar with this concept).

It's also awkward for her to be the only person who has to leave a sleep over, it's embarrassing for her. \n\nYour daughter was going to feel some resentment eventually, it's not fair for you to be on the receiving end of that.

I'm willing to wager your wife has been sexually abused, and doesn't want your daughter anywhere she can't supervise her. I totally get it, back in my day dads and boyfriends of the moms who held sleepovers were very loose about wearing clothing, said inappropriate things to us girls, and touched/bumped us inappropriately.

No arguing.", "Would it be a Y T A even if she had some personal trauma to make her act this way? \nAt the end of the day, It might make it go from N T A to N A H, as you could argue that the mum has reasons for thinking in such a way, but this doesn\u2019t change the fact that controlling your teenage child this way is detrimental to them, and to the child-parent relationship", "Okay, so isn't the mother undermining the father's authority?", "So who gets to play that card in a disagreement?", "NTA your wife needs therapy. If she doesn\u2019t stop her anxiety by proxy, concerning her aversion to sleepovers, your daughter is going to flee your household at 18. \n\nNo, it\u2019s not ok for your wife to have a iron fisted rule.\n\nNo it\u2019s not healthy for your wife to have the ability to deny your daughter a forever NO to innocent activities because of her own fears.\n\nAnd it\u2019s your job to protect your daughter from unreasonable situations even from inside your own household.", "I can see how it could be viewed as projecting and I agree it\u2019s not entirely healthy. Still, the parents need to agree and not point fingers. As I said, if they\u2019re friends with the girls parents, then flex trust by letting her stay over. The mom should be a bit more flexible. \n\nAlso, there might not be any obvious fears, but you never truly know people.", "I mean, she\u2019s still a child technically and teens aren\u2019t good about understanding safety in situations and don\u2019t have the comprehension of adults. The Mom might be acting a bit overprotective, but she has a right to. The parents need to find a way to be united instead of pointing fingers.", "Your daughter is just going to get more resentful as she gets older. Is there an age (BEFORE 18) that wife would allow? I understand not letting kids go to random sleepovers, but if you know the family\u2026\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Whether it is fair or not is not the point. It may be something she can\u2019t help.

It could be his wife needs help, but dividing the family isn\u2019t that help.", "No, because the mother is not sneaking behind OPs back and arguing against his decision.", "It's like shotgun or dibs, whoever says it first.", "OP is correctly protecting his daughter from an unreasonable situation. It\u2019s his job as a parent. \n\nThe days of controlling every movement of the teenage are over. At 13, of course she should be trusted to sleep over at a family friends home. These other parents are friendly and have been in OP\u2019s home many times.\n\nThis is about control, not child safety. It\u2019s damaging to the teen, and will create chaos in the family.\n\nYou are very incorrect.", "So if they were standing together with their daughter and dad said, \"Ok sweetie, you are a responsible young lady and please have a good time on the sleepover\" would Mom be required to go along to preserve the united front?"]}
