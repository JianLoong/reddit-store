Her rationale is that abuse and or misbehavior (drinking, drugs, etc.) could happen. This is something she feels very strongly about. It was never a huge issue before the past few years.\n\nOur daughter has a very tight-knit group of friends. Our daughter is best friends with one of the girls (Ella). Ella frequently hosts sleepovers and the other girls attend, but our daughter doesn\u2019t. We compromise by having her go over and then picking her up at about 9 pm, which she dislikes, but it never was a huge issue before.\n\nHowever this past year it got a lot worse.\n\nElla\u2019s parents own a vacation home about 2.5 hours away. They spend most of the summer there and frequently go for weekends during the year. The other girls spent 2 weeks there with Ella this past summer, and have been going with her for weekends every so often.\n\nMy wife won\u2019t let our daughter go and it has turned our house into a warzone. \n\nI don\u2019t agree with my wife\u2019s rule and have argued with her repeatedly over it. Ella\u2019s parents are nice people and have had us over to their house before, and the other girls go there frequently with no issues. My wife will not change her mind. \n\nSo when my daughter asked me what I thought about the summer trip, I was honest - that I had no issue with it, but her mom was the one who said no. Ever since then their relationship has really deteriorated. Our daughter hates spending time with her and will do anything to avoid it, and frequently snaps and lashes out at her. My wife is in tears several times a week over this. I figured some of this is just our daughter being a teen, but it just seems to be getting worse.\n\nMy wife says I have thrown her under the bus, but I don\u2019t agree.

Being unable to spend time with her friends on an occasional overnight and being picked up at 9pm is embarrassing for her. I'm thinking your wife needs to relax her sphincter a little bit and compromise. Maybe at first, your daughter can go once a month as a trial run. \n\nMaybe she can talk to the parents hosting the sleepover. Will they be there with the girls the whole time? Is there a security system in place and is the alarm set every night? Does your daughter have a cell phone in case she feels uncomfortable at any time?

She is going to cause a huge rift between her and your daughter, not to mention, the mental health damage to your daughter that she is and will continue to experience because she misses out on normal 13 year old girl experiences, will stay with her forever. She will stop getting invited to places eventually, which will alienate her gradually and painfully from the friend group. Breaks my heart honestly.

If you hadn't tried being reasonable with your wife before I'd say otherwise because you need to present a united front as much as you can.

Did she hear a horror story that has really stuck with her? Did something bad happen to her or someone close to her at a sleepover?\n\nIf your daughter isn't shown some trust and independence soon, you might reach a point of no return and the relationship between your daughter and her mum could become damaged longterm (if it isn't already), and potentially just as bad, your daughter could very easily become underequipped to handle the more complex and dangerous situations that will probably crop up when she's an older teen. The tweenage sleepovers are (imho) kind of essential for helping kids figure out their own boundaries with peers/friends--not to mention closer bonding.\n\nPurely anecdotal, but when I started university, no one partied harder, made more reckless decisions, or called/visited their family less in freshman year than the kids who had just gotten out from a strict, sheltered household.", "NTA your wife needs a therapist.", "NTA.

To detach her daughter from her friends? Be a mama's girl and get made fun of at school? I disagree the \"throwing her under the bus\" accusation, 13 year old is old enough to deserve the truth and honesty. She's crying over her own decisions and was too stubborn to change her ways. This is a recipe for exactly what she fears.", "NTA\n\nYou did not override her and let 13 go anyways.

Your wife could have presented her case better, but I have the same stance as her. In sleepovers you cannot control what other people do with your child, despite the outward persona they want to portray (I think you might be familiar with this concept).

But my main reason for posting is some advice.\n\nMy mother was a survivor of years of SA in her adolescent/teen years. Obviously this colored how she raised me, her daughter. She was fiercely protective and determined that I never experience what she did. However, she did not completely shield me because she knew I would have interactions that I would need to learn how to handle.\n\nWe had a safe word. Still do, in fact. If I ever felt unsafe but couldn't say it, the safe word was used. If I was ever uncomfortable and didn't want to stay somewhere, I could call her, and she'd get me, no questions about it. She would not let me go to someone's house that she never met before unless a trusted parent was present. I could not stay overnight at their house unless she met them, knew where they lived (if I was getting picked up), had their names and phone numbers. She let me be a kid and taught me how to be safe. Once I was old enough, she taught me ways to discourage certain actions (fight, yell, and never be afraid to pee or poop yourself, which has worked before for some). She explained why certain people made me feel uncomfortable and what behaviors to look out for. She had an open door policy and let me know I could tell her anything and she would never be mad even if I did something I shouldnt have. She gave me tools to live in a world that may want to harm me. \n\nYour daughter is going to face misogynistic, creepy comments in her life. It's a guarantee, I don't know a single female who hasn't. Hopefully she never experiences more than that. But sheltering her will not prevent it. She needs to understand what behaviors are okay and are not, what to do if flags are raised, she needs to trust that if she feels unsafe her parents will be there. If she doesn't already, you can get her a cell phone. Most have an emergency system you can activate in which the user presses a button 3 times, and texts are sent to trusted contacts with a location link and audio clip. \n\nYou both need to have faith and trust in her. If she can't have faith in trust in her parents, and the knowledge and resources to handle herself, you aren't setting her up for success. You guys know these parents and trust them.

I'm not saying it's all because of my parents but their overprotective and authoritarian parenting style had significant bearing on how I view and navigate the world as an adult.\n\n\nI have a great relationship with my parents btw.

I understand your wife's concerns about sleepovers, although the older kids get the harder it gets.  I was extremely cautious about sleepovers for little kids when I didn't know the parents.

It's not doing then any favours for when they leave home if they're so sheltered.

Eventually she agreed to go and the police picked us up and took her to mine where her mother was. My mate started shouting about how she wasn't allowed to stay out and the police even told her mum that it wasn't fair and it explained why my friend was acting the way she was .

The parents were extremely strict about no candy and junk food. I am all for this and am a very healthy eater myself, but when i saw the way the child would be excluded from having cake at bday parties, trick or treating, etc, it was honestly tragic.. instead of raising the kid to value healthy food, the child is going to resent the parents.
