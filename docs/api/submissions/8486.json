Her rationale is that abuse and or misbehavior (drinking, drugs, etc.) could happen. This is something she feels very strongly about. It was never a huge issue before the past few years.\n\nOur daughter has a very tight-knit group of friends. Our daughter is best friends with one of the girls (Ella). Ella frequently hosts sleepovers and the other girls attend, but our daughter doesn\u2019t. We compromise by having her go over and then picking her up at about 9 pm, which she dislikes, but it never was a huge issue before.\n\nHowever this past year it got a lot worse.\n\nElla\u2019s parents own a vacation home about 2.5 hours away. They spend most of the summer there and frequently go for weekends during the year. The other girls spent 2 weeks there with Ella this past summer, and have been going with her for weekends every so often.\n\nMy wife won\u2019t let our daughter go and it has turned our house into a warzone. \n\nI don\u2019t agree with my wife\u2019s rule and have argued with her repeatedly over it.

Ever since then their relationship has really deteriorated. Our daughter hates spending time with her and will do anything to avoid it, and frequently snaps and lashes out at her. My wife is in tears several times a week over this. I figured some of this is just our daughter being a teen, but it just seems to be getting worse.\n\nMy wife says I have thrown her under the bus, but I don\u2019t agree.

I know it's a big fear among parents lately but your daughter feels very left out and you know what? She IS. Being unable to spend time with her friends on an occasional overnight and being picked up at 9pm is embarrassing for her. I'm thinking your wife needs to relax her sphincter a little bit and compromise. Maybe at first, your daughter can go once a month as a trial run. \n\nMaybe she can talk to the parents hosting the sleepover. Will they be there with the girls the whole time? Is there a security system in place and is the alarm set every night? Does your daughter have a cell phone in case she feels uncomfortable at any time?

And it also sounds like your wife may need help here from a therapist because she is doing a huge disservice to your daughter and it seems to stem from an unreasonable paranoia. She is going to cause a huge rift between her and your daughter, not to mention, the mental health damage to your daughter that she is and will continue to experience because she misses out on normal 13 year old girl experiences, will stay with her forever. She will stop getting invited to places eventually, which will alienate her gradually and painfully from the friend group. Breaks my heart honestly. Get her a cell phone, put some tracking apps on that bad boy, make sure she knows code words for needing an \"out\", etc and for the love of god let this teenager start living her teenage life!!", "NTA.

If you hadn't tried being reasonable with your wife before I'd say otherwise because you need to present a united front as much as you can. But as you said, she's made a unilateral decision and won't hear anything about it. At 13 your daughter is old enough to go to sleepover with her friends and not be treated like she's 5.

Did she hear a horror story that has really stuck with her? Did something bad happen to her or someone close to her at a sleepover?\n\nIf your daughter isn't shown some trust and independence soon, you might reach a point of no return and the relationship between your daughter and her mum could become damaged longterm (if it isn't already), and potentially just as bad, your daughter could very easily become underequipped to handle the more complex and dangerous situations that will probably crop up when she's an older teen. The tweenage sleepovers are (imho) kind of essential for helping kids figure out their own boundaries with peers/friends--not to mention closer bonding.\n\nPurely anecdotal, but when I started university, no one partied harder, made more reckless decisions, or called/visited their family less in freshman year than the kids who had just gotten out from a strict, sheltered household.", "NTA your wife needs a therapist.", "NTA.

To detach her daughter from her friends? Be a mama's girl and get made fun of at school? I disagree the \"throwing her under the bus\" accusation, 13 year old is old enough to deserve the truth and honesty. She's crying over her own decisions and was too stubborn to change her ways. This is a recipe for exactly what she fears.", "NTA\n\nYou did not override her and let 13 go anyways. I'm all for a two yes required household with kids, but that doesn't mean the no parent gets to live consequence free if their decision is causing pain and, in this case social, harm.

Your wife could have presented her case better, but I have the same stance as her. In sleepovers you cannot control what other people do with your child, despite the outward persona they want to portray (I think you might be familiar with this concept).

But my main reason for posting is some advice.\n\nMy mother was a survivor of years of SA in her adolescent/teen years. Obviously this colored how she raised me, her daughter. She was fiercely protective and determined that I never experience what she did. However, she did not completely shield me because she knew I would have interactions that I would need to learn how to handle.\n\nWe had a safe word. Still do, in fact. If I ever felt unsafe but couldn't say it, the safe word was used. If I was ever uncomfortable and didn't want to stay somewhere, I could call her, and she'd get me, no questions about it. She would not let me go to someone's house that she never met before unless a trusted parent was present. I could not stay overnight at their house unless she met them, knew where they lived (if I was getting picked up), had their names and phone numbers. She let me be a kid and taught me how to be safe. Once I was old enough, she taught me ways to discourage certain actions (fight, yell, and never be afraid to pee or poop yourself, which has worked before for some). She explained why certain people made me feel uncomfortable and what behaviors to look out for. She had an open door policy and let me know I could tell her anything and she would never be mad even if I did something I shouldnt have. She gave me tools to live in a world that may want to harm me. \n\nYour daughter is going to face misogynistic, creepy comments in her life. It's a guarantee, I don't know a single female who hasn't. Hopefully she never experiences more than that. But sheltering her will not prevent it. She needs to understand what behaviors are okay and are not, what to do if flags are raised, she needs to trust that if she feels unsafe her parents will be there.

If she's upset even after seeing what good it is for her daughter, maybe she shouldn't be raising a child.

In this situation I feel like the mother needs to truly sit down and explain her reasonings in black and white with her daughter. As a parent who will not allow sleepovers at other peoples houses even I would look at this specific scenario in a different way. As a 13yr old she knows what is right or wrong- she needs to start being equipped for protecting herself and she needs to be put in the position to make mistakes or make the right decisions. I was a good kid and I drank with friends at sleepovers at her age experimenting- it isn\u2019t evil for a 13yr old to sneak a cooler and be giddy after half of one.

I had to train myself not to look for abusive traits in every relationship. I'm going with NAH because I know working with traumatized people, or toxic people, and therapists do both, causes its own trauma and i had to leave my job because this kind of trauma, the paranoia, is actually very hard to get rid of when you are continually getting it reinforced. So if it comes down to sleepovers or your wife's job- well i would rather the world has good therapists. The one thing I will say is be very careful what role you take here- one of the worst cases I ever dealt with was when a father convinced a mother that she was being too strict and they left her with a trusted friend of the father for a few hours, and their child was assaulted.

But from there, 9pm or 10pm or a sleepover isn\u2019t going to make a difference.

There is a LOT a child can be getting exposed to through mediums like the internet that a well adjusted family can go entirely unaware of while it's being unleashed on other children.
