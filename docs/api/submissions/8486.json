Her rationale is that abuse and or misbehavior (drinking, drugs, etc.) could happen. This is something she feels very strongly about. It was never a huge issue before the past few years.\n\nOur daughter has a very tight-knit group of friends. Our daughter is best friends with one of the girls (Ella). Ella frequently hosts sleepovers and the other girls attend, but our daughter doesn\u2019t. We compromise by having her go over and then picking her up at about 9 pm, which she dislikes, but it never was a huge issue before.\n\nHowever this past year it got a lot worse.\n\nElla\u2019s parents own a vacation home about 2.5 hours away. They spend most of the summer there and frequently go for weekends during the year. The other girls spent 2 weeks there with Ella this past summer, and have been going with her for weekends every so often.\n\nMy wife won\u2019t let our daughter go and it has turned our house into a warzone. \n\nI don\u2019t agree with my wife\u2019s rule and have argued with her repeatedly over it. Ella\u2019s parents are nice people and have had us over to their house before, and the other girls go there frequently with no issues. My wife will not change her mind. \n\nSo when my daughter asked me what I thought about the summer trip, I was honest - that I had no issue with it, but her mom was the one who said no. Ever since then their relationship has really deteriorated. Our daughter hates spending time with her and will do anything to avoid it, and frequently snaps and lashes out at her. My wife is in tears several times a week over this. I figured some of this is just our daughter being a teen, but it just seems to be getting worse.\n\nMy wife says I have thrown her under the bus, but I don\u2019t agree.

I'm thinking your wife needs to relax her sphincter a little bit and compromise. Maybe at first, your daughter can go once a month as a trial run. \n\nMaybe she can talk to the parents hosting the sleepover. Will they be there with the girls the whole time? Is there a security system in place and is the alarm set every night? Does your daughter have a cell phone in case she feels uncomfortable at any time?

She is going to cause a huge rift between her and your daughter, not to mention, the mental health damage to your daughter that she is and will continue to experience because she misses out on normal 13 year old girl experiences, will stay with her forever. She will stop getting invited to places eventually, which will alienate her gradually and painfully from the friend group. Breaks my heart honestly.

If you hadn't tried being reasonable with your wife before I'd say otherwise because you need to present a united front as much as you can.

Did she hear a horror story that has really stuck with her? Did something bad happen to her or someone close to her at a sleepover?\n\nIf your daughter isn't shown some trust and independence soon, you might reach a point of no return and the relationship between your daughter and her mum could become damaged longterm (if it isn't already), and potentially just as bad, your daughter could very easily become underequipped to handle the more complex and dangerous situations that will probably crop up when she's an older teen. The tweenage sleepovers are (imho) kind of essential for helping kids figure out their own boundaries with peers/friends--not to mention closer bonding.\n\nPurely anecdotal, but when I started university, no one partied harder, made more reckless decisions, or called/visited their family less in freshman year than the kids who had just gotten out from a strict, sheltered household.", "NTA your wife needs a therapist.", "NTA.

To detach her daughter from her friends? Be a mama's girl and get made fun of at school? I disagree the \"throwing her under the bus\" accusation, 13 year old is old enough to deserve the truth and honesty. She's crying over her own decisions and was too stubborn to change her ways. This is a recipe for exactly what she fears.", "NTA\n\nYou did not override her and let 13 go anyways.

Your wife could have presented her case better, but I have the same stance as her. In sleepovers you cannot control what other people do with your child, despite the outward persona they want to portray (I think you might be familiar with this concept).

But my main reason for posting is some advice.\n\nMy mother was a survivor of years of SA in her adolescent/teen years. Obviously this colored how she raised me, her daughter. She was fiercely protective and determined that I never experience what she did. However, she did not completely shield me because she knew I would have interactions that I would need to learn how to handle.\n\nWe had a safe word. Still do, in fact. If I ever felt unsafe but couldn't say it, the safe word was used. If I was ever uncomfortable and didn't want to stay somewhere, I could call her, and she'd get me, no questions about it. She would not let me go to someone's house that she never met before unless a trusted parent was present. I could not stay overnight at their house unless she met them, knew where they lived (if I was getting picked up), had their names and phone numbers. She let me be a kid and taught me how to be safe. Once I was old enough, she taught me ways to discourage certain actions (fight, yell, and never be afraid to pee or poop yourself, which has worked before for some). She explained why certain people made me feel uncomfortable and what behaviors to look out for. She had an open door policy and let me know I could tell her anything and she would never be mad even if I did something I shouldnt have. She gave me tools to live in a world that may want to harm me. \n\nYour daughter is going to face misogynistic, creepy comments in her life. It's a guarantee, I don't know a single female who hasn't. Hopefully she never experiences more than that. But sheltering her will not prevent it. She needs to understand what behaviors are okay and are not, what to do if flags are raised, she needs to trust that if she feels unsafe her parents will be there. If she doesn't already, you can get her a cell phone. Most have an emergency system you can activate in which the user presses a button 3 times, and texts are sent to trusted contacts with a location link and audio clip. \n\nYou both need to have faith and trust in her. If she can't have faith in trust in her parents, and the knowledge and resources to handle herself, you aren't setting her up for success. You guys know these parents and trust them.

I think she\u2019s maybe going overboard if she and OP do know the parents and they are decent people and nothing untoward has occurred previously. She\u2019s certainly straining her relationship with her daughter. But OP did throw her under the bus with saying he doesn\u2019t care, it\u2019s all her. True but not helpful. \n\nMe, I\u2019d be speaking candidly with the friends parents, asking about how things have gone with these other sleepovers, making sure access to alcohol, etc wasn\u2019t an issue and giving it a go with a local sleepover. Let the daughter build up to going for the weekend once it\u2019s established that it\u2019s safe, build up the trust. \n\n\nI just can\u2019t call the wife as asshole if she\u2019s scared to death that something terrible will happen to her daughter in a place which is a long drive to get to. I\u2019m voting NAH. Everyone has a point but no one is communicating effectively because they\u2019re all angry or scared.", "I know several therapists and NONE of them allow sleepovers... If parents only knew how much SA happens at sleepovers \ud83d\ude2c", "I mean that will do it. One of the major reasons I don't have children is because I work with abused kids and I can't imagine being able to leave that at the office. I am the fun aunt in many ways but I also have been a hard line advocate for making sure my niblings from before they start school know that their bodies belong to them and to scream and get help if someone makes them uncomfortable.", "As someone who was abused growing up your wife seriously needs to get a grip. For every horror story she reads there's dozens of sleepovers where absolutely nothing of note happens. Your wife is looking through a haystack to find the needle.", "And people die all the time, assault happens everywhere and just focusing on sleepovers is not the answer. She needs to realize she\u2019s hyper focusing on the wrong thing. Instead why not be upfront with daughter about the possible dangers and what to do if she ever feels uncomfortable? About having a support system and always being available if the sleepovers turn sour? That\u2019s better than just outright saying no because that\u2019s when you get the teenagers that sneak out and do stuff behind your back. You want her to trust you and wife? Be honest  and upfront, don\u2019t baby her", "Tell her to read stories about kids sneaking out of the house as their only way outside of this iron grip. Y'all can either create safe conditions for her to socialize, or she can do whatever she wants without telling you.", "By end goal I meant all the consequences attached to the action, not just the reason behind it. Restricting experience towards independence and social activities is also a form of abuse itself.", "Would you wife be open to family therapy to address this specific issue? Maybe an impartial person would help. Since she is a therapist herself, she may be open to this.", "If an event happens, redditors arnt gonna be the one who supports her, its gonna be you guys. I am sure you will feel great when your wife can say i wanted to keep you safe but your dad cared more about \"experiences\" cause the online crowd was sure its important. While the woman who hears about SA everyday was just being over protective. The no of posts of sexual abuses while sleepover, and still thinking its more important is astounding. And for the defence of assault happens in day too, yeah you can speak with teach her about how to defend herself, but letting her be vulnerable at a completely avoidable point seems stupid.", "There is a much higher risk of abuse in a private home at night than at the mall during the day because predators feel safer in their own settings. Letting them sleep in the homes of other adults that you don\u2019t really know is a big risk and I think it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to not want to allow your child to do it. Additionally, has his wife experienced that kind of trauma at sleepovers? It could very well inform her decision and I can\u2019t fault her for that.", "As partners you make decisions together. If one doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with something proposed then you don\u2019t do it. Your parenting decisions have to be unified or else you\u2019re just opening your relationship up to damage. OP didn\u2019t like what his wife wants, doesn\u2019t respect her opinion on the matter and threw her under the bus and involved the child (who doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s best for her at this point and is only reacting because she wants to have fun). \n\nAs a mother you should also understand her reasoning. It\u2019s nuts if you think she\u2019s the bad guy here.", "The problem is, this stuff doesn\u2019t just happen at sleepovers. As a teacher, we\u2019re trained to recognise situations when this may happen *at school*. What you can do is teach children about body autonomy, boundaries and consent and make yourself a safe person to talk to if they ever feel unsafe. If your kid is going to a sleepover, talk about what they feel comfortable with when they\u2019re changing etc and let them know that if they feel uncomfortable with something, it\u2019s ok to call you. Talk through scenarios to give them (and you) more confidence in how to act and react. This is basically what happens is good PSHE curriculums in school.", "TW: SA\n\nI was molested by the brother of a friend when I was sleeping at a sleepover. I woke up with my night shirt shirt unbuttoned and him right next to me and I just didn't feel right. \n\nThat being said, I've been very honest about my experiences with my kids and we talk about bodily autonomy, the behaviors of a safe adult, and that if someone makes them feel uncomfortable in any way, tell a trusted adult and don't stop telling them until someone listens. \n\nMy older son never really did sleepovers. He's been to one, and that was this past summer at age 10. It's not that I wouldn't have let him go if he wanted to, he just was never very close friends with boys; most of his friends are girls who aren't allowed to have boys at sleepovers. \n\nMy middle daughter on the other hand made a BFF in kindergarten and they have sleepovers all the time. We know her family and the girls are interchangeably at both houses all the time, which is nice.", "Yep. You may be correct, but at least you're willing to negotiate rules. Op's wife just has a blanket no. So when will it turn into a yes? I can foresee the daughter running out of the house when she's 18 if her mum keeps this up.", "Unfortunately this is far too common \ud83d\ude14", "I read an article by a therapist about how she would never allow any of her children to have sleepovers. That is her one big rule. After reading the article, I absolutely understand the wife's position.", "My therapist says it\u2019s always better to be objective rather than ever give a blanket statement. She\u2019s always said it would be unprofessional to make a blanket statement and generalize on things.", "Wife is a therapist lol\n\nNTA", "Let's stay rational. Even if she never lets her child go to a sleepover ever, it will still be very far from meeting any criteria for child abuse.", "It sounds like the only way to agree is the mom always being right, sadly. \nNo, you can\u2019t always truly know people, but I think I\u2019m this particular case they could go with the benefit of the doubt.", "Everything you just wrote about OP can be applied just as easily to his wife. She didn't like OPs want to let his daughter stay at her friends, she doesn't respect his opinion on the matter, actively refuses to have a conversation about it and is upset that she has to own her own choice. \n\nIt's nuts that you feel it's okay for her to steamroll OP but it's not okay for OP to admit that's what's happening.", "That's so true, people feel so secure because they don't let their daughters spend the night outside, a famous phrase here is \"madam, people fuck during the day too\"", "Absolutely! Sports teams. Board game clubs and youth Groups. Acting classes. Everywhere in life is an experience!", "Exactly. I had countless sleepovers as a kid, and was never assaulted. I *was* constantly harassed by my male classmates in the 6th grade, and one of the boys even assaulted me.", "I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. It\u2019s horrible when you feel / are unsafe.   \n\n\nOur rules is \u201cnot until you are 10\u201d and it\u2019s worked well enough \u2026 the other rule is \u201cthere has to be enough trust and a relationshp between the other parents/family and us, and we get the veto power on that\u201d and it\u2019s been fine. Older son has had many, with his BFF. Younger son has just cruised past 10 and is frustrated because his BFF isn\u2019t allowed sleepovers yet, so has to wait. Works for me ;)", "Sure. And kids who are too sheltered don\u2019t get to make the smaller mistakes and learn from them (or encounter the smaller problems and resolve them) and suddenly the Adult World is Big and Frightening.   \n\n\nIt\u2019s important for kids to have \u2018developmentally appropriate\u2019 experiences and learn to manage themselves in various settings.", "Do you really not see the fallacy in your arguments or are you being obtuse on purpose?", "If I\u2019m wrong, that\u2019s fine. I was a teen that hated sleep overs and ended up in bad or uncomfortable situations because of them, so I may be biased. I will take your comments into consideration.", "A veto is not stream-rolling someone else. Not feeling comfortable with something is not the same as forcing the other person\u2019s hand. For any parental decisions, both parents consent should be had. If one or the other do not consent then the action should not go forward. It sounds like they\u2019ve had plenty of conversations/arguments about it. Only OP\u2019s wife kept the decision making between them and OP decided to tell the daughter to force his wife\u2019s hand."]}
