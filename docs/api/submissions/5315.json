NTA", "INFO: what is his family making for dinner?", "NTA i don't know him, but I'm seeing red flags. \n\nYou said you ways celebrate actual Christmas with hsi family because (even tho you don't like it) that's just how things ended up? Why is his family more important? Why aren't you alternating every year?\n\nHe's refusing to go to your family's because of the choice of food?! Since when is Christmas (Eve) only about dinner? \n\nYou think he's being unreasonable so you said you won't attend his family's Christmas and he says YOU are the problem? \n\nSounds like he's trying to isolate you from your family. Which is one of the first steps of abuse. \n\nLike I said. I don't know him. But be careful", "NTA. And from what you've said about going to his family's place for Christmas for the last 5 years, it seems to me he's being intentionally manipulative to get his own way and keep you away from your family. Ask yourself how many times you have made compromises for him and his family, not just on Christmas but all year long, do you make sure to cater to his family on their various birthdays and celebrations and does he do the same thing for your family? Send a little gift and apology to his family saying why you won't be there, go to your parents place and have a good time. Maybe after the holidays rethink of this holiday dynamic with your husband, because it might be a hell of a lot of other behaviours that he's displayed throughout the year.", "NTA. Sounds fair to me.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry but this has me cackling a bit\u2026 like why is beef the last straw? Does he not get Turkey the next day at his parents? This is such a weird hill for a grown up to die on. Not gonna lie he\u2019d be opening up one of those obnoxious stuffed animal backpack leashes Christmas Eve morning so I could drag him there, if ya gonna act like a child ima treat you like one. \n\nOn a serious note though\u2026. Have you talked to him about anxiety or depression? My anxiety tends to manifest as anger over little petty things and I didn\u2019t recognize it for the longest time.", "Nta. He's acting like a petulant child.", "NTA - you have a husband problem and not a beef problem lols", "NTA.  He's being ridiculous", ">purely because he wants to eat turkey for dinner.\n\nAnd like... correct me if I'm wrong, but if they are going to HIS family's place on Christmas day to have Second Christmas, doesn't it seem like the odds are very high that his family will serve... turkey?  \n\nHe's not even NOT GETTING TURKEY.  (Presumably.)  He wants TURKEY FOR BOTH? Or he WON'T PLAY?\n\nI don't get this guy.  (Having to have 2 turkey dinners back to back every year would drive me bonkers.)\n\nI mean apart from anything else, if you just loved turkey that much and were going to miss out on turkey at the holiday meal you'll be a guest at... then buy a freaking turkey and cook it yourself for Boxing Day or whatever.  You can cook turkey and eat it on ANY DAY!", "NTA. \n\nSeems obvious to me. And this guy gets why. Also. NTA because IMO beef > turkey anyways. So yeah", "Yes, won't he have turkey literally the next day?", "\\^\\^\\^ This. All day, all night, this. \\^\\^\\^", "Also: NTA!\n\nBUT ALSO!  I think a lot of us here are looking at this and saying, \"it's not about the turkey\". (The Iranian Yogurt is not The Issue Here.)  There's likely something else underlying this, and it might help if you can dig down to get at what that is.\n\nIf by some chance it really is the turkey, though -- it may not have occurred to him, or even you, that you know... you can buy a turkey and roast it at any time, if what you love is roast turkey.  It is not limited to Thanksgiving and (some people's) Christmas dinner.\n\n(I know that people get more attached to having The Traditional Foods at a holiday dinner, or it's Just Not Right.  But again, this doesn't make a ton of sense here, because this is Xmas Eve dinner, not Christmas dinner; and this isn't his own house, it's your parents' house. He won't be missing the Christmas turkey dinner his heart apparently desires.  So, again: something else is wrong here.)", "I have a suspicion that a lot more than just Christmas is weighted in your husband and his families\u2019 favor in your relationship.\nYou seem the only one who is willing to ever compromise. \n\nDo you have a reciprocal and respectful relationship?", "Just buy him a pre-cooked turkey breast for dinner and tell him to suck it up.

It may be time for him to check in with a professional.", "Who wouldn't want beef for dinner? I don't really like turkey but did it once a year for Thanksgiving until my hub got a legit poultry allergy. Oh darn... gotta buy a prime rib now. Turns out no one cares and everyone loves that I splurge on prime rib. \n\nI don't know why this is his hill to die on. God forbid you were Italian and actually did the Seven Fishes. What would he do then?\n\nThere's no set protein for Christmas.", "I'm on your side too.  My family has been doing this for many, many years.  It has evolved over the years from full on dinner, to snacking the whole time, to going out to eat.", "I would definitely bail on his family.", "Nah, listen, I'm coming in late to this post, but I'm on your side as well.\n\nFor one thing: you guys should be switching off the days.  This year, your family gets Xmas Eve and his gets Xmas. Next year, reverse that.  (That is, if you and your family care whether it's Xmas Eve or Xmas. Maybe you don't really?  But if people do care, the only fair thing to do is to alternate.)\n\nFor another: if you guys are going to his family's on Xmas day... they are presumably serving turkey?  So he'll get his turkey?  Am I missing something?  He's throwing a fit because he wants TWO TURKEY DINNERS on successive days?  BUDDY.  WHAT.\n\nI also frankly think you're in the right about saying that if he is going to bail on YOUR family, which in insulting not only to you but to them, then you are going to make it up to your family by staying with them on Xmas too, and not go to his place.\n\nI get that things are perhaps complicated by him experiencing some mental health difficulties, perhaps seasonally related.  Don't sleep on that; if you can, you guys gotta talk about that.  You know from experience; he may need help, and he should get it.\n\nBut having mental health issues doesn't excuse you being a jerk to your wife or her family on the holidays over a non-issue like serving beef instead of turkey.  (It wouldn't excuse a lot of things; but especially not that!)  \n\nBest of luck with this!", ">Finally, let\u2019s say you can\u2019t eat anything at someone\u2019s house. Is it that tragic to just eat before you leave and again when you get home? Have we gotten so crazy we cannot go a few hours without food? It\u2019s bizarre.\n\nYou're being pretty disingenious here. That kinda meal on Christmas is a main-focus of the festivities, people slave away over the food *for hours*, sometimes even for multiple days. You can't just act like this is some kinda \"Can we just make a short stop at the KFC on the drive home?\" situation.\n\nI agree it's absolutely ridiculous to throw a tantrum over this entire beef/turkey issue when OP's husband generally has absolutely no issue with beef and just *prefers* Turkey on that one specific day, but if we cross from tantrums into territories where people literally can't eat anything that's offered, that just borders on rude af honestly. If I knew someone was allergic to certain things or couldn't eat them for other reasons reasons (religious, ethical, just generally can't stand them), I would try my best to accomodate them in some way or another. Either make them things they can eat or at the very least allow them to bring their own food so they can sit and eat with you and everyone else. Could they eat beforehand? Sure. *Should* they? Hell no. Don't invite them to a whole ass dinner event if you don't care about them enough so they can eat.", "I had no idea turkey at Christmas was a thing. We have always done beef/seafood.", "Let's be fair to wolves here. I don't think they'd complain that the hunk of meat set before them was the wrong kind of free food.", "Yeah, that might be true for you, but OP and her partner decided to not spend Christmas time with each other over *one single meal*. That's not a logistical problem, that's one of them being a huge crybaby over nothing and the other person reacting in desperation.\n\nI'm pretty sure you can see a very clear difference between your reasons to spend Christmas at different places and whatever the eff is going on in OP's relationship. I'd certainly hope so.", "You do you girl but that is weird as fuck.", "HIS tradition. Other family's have different traditions", "INFO: your husband says the beef is the \"last straw\".\n\nWhat were the other straws? What else bothers him so much about seeing your family?", "We alternated for years since my family was a few hours away whereas his is several states away. We got tired of that so one year didn\u2019t go to either of our parents for any holiday and it stuck.", "I feel like there are levels. There are allergies which I agree should be accommodated.\n\nThere are preferences like vegetarian, vegan, keto, only eating organic, etc. and those people I feel need to bring their own food or make do with what\u2019s available from the host.\n\nBut then there\u2019s a whole mess of people who want to claim just crazy nonsense bullshit, i.e. they have a form of autism that makes certain food textures unbearable and so they can only eat two things in the world and they accuse their families of being ableist if they\u2019re not accommodated. Or they are recovering from an eating disorder and 99% of food triggers them so the meal has to be built around their preferences. My unpopular opinion is these people should not expect to be accommodated and need therapy and/or medication so they\u2019re able to function in a pretty commonplace social situation such as a communal meal.\n\nLastly, if Christmas is food-based for hours that\u2019s not great and that can be changed. A lot of families focus on gifts, singing Christmas songs, watching Christmas movies, or playing a board game. I dated a person whose family was really into running charity 5ks every holiday which was totally not my thing but hey, they loved it. And I ran a few with them because who cares?? It didn\u2019t kill me and I cared about the people so why not try it? That\u2019s how I feel about all these people losing their minds over one meal. Just fuckin try it. If you hate it, be hungry for a little while and eat later. Not the end of the world.", "During the past 10 years, my Christmas meals were: Turkey with red cabbage, dumplings, potatoes and gravy; lobster soup; homemade sushi; raclette; potato salad with wienerwurst; a vegan seitan-roast; vegan seitan-jackfruit-chicken wings. I think we had a cheese fondue one year as well (although maybe my memory serves me wrong and that was NYE).\n\nThat's just the things I can immediately think off. My In-Laws never were very keen on a super traditional Christmas meals and I'm very glad about it. I never really got the whole turkey hype anyway and I'd much rather just have something special in general than just doing the same boring shit over and over again. Not tryna hate on people who like Turkey, I'm sure I'd have enjoyed having one every single year if my In-Laws had insisted on it, but I'm just glad it didn't turn out that way", "The stretch is that bit about gaslighting. I\u2019m not seeing anything like that here."]}
