These athletes are younger than me around (18M) to (22M) most of them came from underprivileged families. Our coach is 31M. I\u2019m the oldest one in the group so I\u2019m like their big sister. I also worked full time and have my own income unlike them that they are FT athletes/student and coach. \n\nI know that it is hard to be an athlete especially when you don\u2019t have enough support financially. Training and races are expensive. \n\nSo when I have extra money I make sure to share it to the other young athletes and the coach, through providing nutrition during training, giving them used equipment, registration fees to races and sometimes I provide them cash when they help me out during training so they have some extra money. \n\nAt the start, they never directly asked for this but I just offered since I really want to help them be more motivated to train and get better as I know how hard it is to do something that you love and you lack resources since that was what I had experienced before. \n\nBut as a year passed, I just recently noticed on multiple instances that they expect me to pay all the time. They sometimes order food during training and expect me to shoulder all the expenses. At this point, they already have a sponsor that provides them with food allowance for training. So I was expecting that they will use it. I don\u2019t mind chipping in but the fact that they would expect me to shoulder everything even though they have allowances is just wrong. I also noticed that when I do not provide them financial support for race registration, transportation costs, etc that they are a bit passive aggressive and I can feel that their treatment has changed a bit.

I feel that I am being taking advantage.\n\nJust this week, two of the athletes asked me, if I can donate a small amount for their training expenses and another asked if I can help out on his upcoming race. \n\nI have started to ignore their requests and I am planning on pausing my training with this group and maybe find a new coach.
