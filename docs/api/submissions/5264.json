{"id": 5264, "submission_id": "zr2c2l", "title": "AITA for wanting to tell my in-laws to stop acting like my kids are theirs?", "selftext": "Since having our first kid (we now have three), my in-laws (let\u2019s call them mimi and papa) have become very possessive over my children and seem to think that they\u2019re my kids\u2019 actual parents, not grandparents. I often feel like I just exist to bring them grandchildren. With both my pregnancies (I have twins), they thanked me for caring their grandkids. At first I couldn\u2019t figure out why it bothered me so much that they thanked me for caring my own kids but then I realized why it bothered me: I felt like just a surrogate for their grand babies. With our kids it\u2019s always about their side of the family\u2014they look like my husband, they have Mimi\u2019s chin, they like the same favorite colors, they carry on their family name, etc etc. when my girls came out very white skinned (they\u2019re Hispanic and I\u2019m not), Papa commented that they don\u2019t look like the family. They sent me a ton of books to read with my son when he was born and you\u2019d expect them to maybe send some \u201cmommy and me\u201d or \u201cdaddy and me\u201d books but no\u2014they were all about \u201cgrandpa loves me\u201d or \u201cGrandma is my whole world\u201d type books. They made themselves grandparent t-shirts and mugs but never once have they given me a mother to my child type gift. They bought matching pjs and took a Christmas picture with just my son, not including us as the parents. Papa is the one whose behaviors bother me most. He literally needs my kids to love him. A lot of the gifts he gives my kids are somehow related to his interests and likes, not even things my kids would ask for or want but he just wants them to think of him always. He tells our son to call him if he has any issues with us or to know that papa loves him most. He talked about how needy he was going to be of our new kids before they were born, especially if they were girls. Well we did have twin girls and he has continued his obsessive behaviors. He has genuinely cried because we put a cute big eye filter on our babies and told us we can\u2019t do that because we\u2019re \u201cmaking fun of them\u201d but we would never\u2014it\u2019s just cute and funny and something we\u2019d do to our own faces. He made an ornament with all three of our kids and then just Mimi and papa, as if that\u2019s the family tree. My final straw in feeling weirded out by his actions was a comment he made when my newborn girl\u2019s onesie sleeve was pulled down, revealing her shoulder. When I noticed her shoulder was exposed my reaction was \u201coh she\u2019s going to get cold, let\u2019s fix that.\u201d what was his thought? He said \u201cwow I don\u2019t want my granddaughter showing skin, gotta cover up girl.\u201d Why would you even think that way with a newborn? Anyways, AITA for wanting to address these behaviors?", "created_utc": 1671576700, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zr2c2l/aita_for_wanting_to_tell_my_inlaws_to_stop_acting/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They need boundaries. However, I did thank my sons girlfriend for making me a Grandma, I know that I am the GRANDMA and not the Mom, nor do I want to be the Mom. My grandson has rwo capable parents, I am just here to babysit and spoil him rotten! \nYour in-laws have some strange behaviors.", "NTA. Sounds like your in-laws have a MAJOR case of Do Over Baby.\n\nAlso what the seven scented shit is that \"showing skin\" comment? Those attitudes WILL Fuck up your kids. Good on you for wanting to shut it down!", "That whole showing skin thing gives me the creeps. And him focusing on the girls... I'm not so sure I would leave him alone with them.", "NTA. You should set some boundaries NOW, while the kids are little. There have been horror stories on reddit of grandparents trying to get custody of grandchildren.", "Yeah, I had an experience where someone just treated me like an incubator for the children they REALLY wanted. \n\nHave a polite conversation with partner first and foremost, talk to all your own kids about how they should be polite and let you know if they\u2019re uncomfortable and say something if they find the grandparents overstepping? I\u2019d probably send out photos with just your immediate family in response, or include grandparents in a future big-everyone-together photoshoot if they\u2019re feeling that excluded that they have to get so weird with it?\n\nAnd just keep on putting filters on eyes and reiterating politely that they\u2019re your kids! NTA.", "Definitely NTA. I'd be concerned for my kids if I were in your place, especially with the girls. It may seem trivial to others right now, assuming that they are still little, but it will get out of hand once they start growing up more. Others may think it's just excessive love and care from their side, but this sort of behavior somehow indicates that what they're looking forward to doing the most is controlling them. Shape them to how they want them to be. Also, the way the grandfather talked about your newborn is not okay. It's actually extremely worrying that a newborn girl is being... well, sexualized. I hope you discuss it with your husband and find a way out for yourself and your kids.", "NTA, you need boundaries ASAP.", "Okay this is pretty scary, says the kid who grew up in her grandmas skirt and to this day still visit regularly. NTA", "Info: how did they treat you before the kids were born?", "INFO have you discussed this with your husband or the in-laws before? If so, what was the response, especially husband?", "NTA. Sit down with your husband and tell him your boundaries. You need to set boundaries now or it's going to be worse.", "NTA\n\nI would be very worried about leaving the kids with grandpa with his weird sexual innuendos to you.  Does your husband know about them.\n\nBut they need some strict boundaries.  You don't have to announce them, you just stick with them ie you don't drop everything when they say to come over.  They don't have to see the kids every day and they don't have to pick them up from school.  You say thanks, but no thanks.\n\nBut your husband has to be on your side.   This is his parents and this is normal to him.  He may not want to rock the boat.\n\nWhere are your parents in this?  Do they live close and do you have a good relationship with them.  If your husband thinks that what his parents are doing is okay, just ask him how he would feel if all of a sudden you started doing the same things with your parents and your parents were giving the kids all that stuff his are?", "NTA. Trust your instincts. Have you spoken to your husband about this, and if so, how did that conversation go down?", "NTA. But would your in-laws like my kid???? He\u2019s a biter, and I\u2019m happy to send him their way.", "NTA but maybe scale back visits and head over to r/justnomil", "Whoa. So many red flags here. NTA. And you gotta get in front of this now. Really fast.", "NTA but I will warn you that this behavior is not weird or out of the ordinary in Hispanic culture (I'm Latino myself). It can be suffocating. The main thing you have to do is set hard boundaries and most importantly get your partner onboard because they will try to circumvent your boundaries through them. If you don't have a united front it will cause a rift between you and your in-laws.", "I don\u2019t think YTA but I think there are some serious misunderstandings happening here. \n\nIt would do you well to address them with your husband first and then with the parents. This behavior (I\u2019m hispanic) is very typical in Hispanic families and it\u2019s understandable how it may feel very discomforting and like you\u2019re being alienated. A conversation may make them welcome you in specifics in more. \n\nI will say, I don\u2019t think ANYONE in the situation ITA though. Just not understanding each other.

Yes, I have raised my concerns with my husband and at first he used to try to explain the behaviors and didn\u2019t fully see the issue.
