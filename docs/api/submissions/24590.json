Anyway, several things about this scenario bother me: 1) You locked your door and your sister's TWO children were allowed into your room unsupervised. Why? Is this a thing? Even if there wasn't glass on the floor, I don't see any good reason they would be in your bedroom. I can't imagine you have a bunch of kids' toys in there for them to play with, and if they don't live there, why would they expect to play in someone else's space? 2) This happened during the day and you didn't learn about it until you got home that evening and got scolded. That means that they found the boy, took him to the hospital, and got him stitched up without notifying you that any of this had happened, but operating on the assumption that it was your fault. How did they know you'd knocked over the glass? for all they knew, it was set near the edge of the desk and tumbled over at some point during the course of the day. It's weird that they were both so quick to blame you and so slow to inform you about something they think you're responsible for. 3) Six-year-olds should know better than to eat off the floor, and they should definitely know better than to eat glass. I could see your sister being angry if the boy had cut his foot, but how did she now raise him to know that glass isn't edible? He ought to know better. 4) It was your mother who told (scolded) you about the incident, not the parent of the injured party. It seems like something your sister would want to address herself, seeing as it's her child who got hurt. 5) I don't know your life, but considering you're  worried about job security, I don't expect you have a lot of extra cash lying around for someone else's medical bills. It's inconsiderate to expect you to pay for it and tacky to ask. I'm sorry that this is your family.", "NTA. Stress the fact that you locked the door.\n\nYou took proper precaution to ensure no one gets hurt from the glass.\nWhomever opened your door not only invaded your privacy, but they didn\u2019t do their due diligence before allowing children into the room.

And at 6yo? They really shouldn\u2019t be at the stage where putting everything in their mouth is still a habit.. what sort of parent allows such a habit to go on for so long? \n\nAlso, how do they know the kid didn\u2019t just break the glass and eat it? If you didn\u2019t tell anyone that you had broken the glass, then shouldn\u2019t the assumption be that the kid did it by himself? In which case?? Why would you be responsible? Unless someone opened the room, saw the broken glass and let the kids in anyway. \n\nEither way, it\u2019s absolutely not your fault.

Does it seem like a family that knows how to parent children\n\nNot to mention neglect happens.. I have someone in my family who ate fucking drywall when he was 6. literally found a hole, opened it up and ate it. Neglectful parents happen. dunno why thats shocking to you.  \n\n\nand again, WAY WORSE stuff happens with children all of the time. You are on reddit, surely youve seen plenty of examples of \"where the fuck are the parents?\" lmao. It is possible. Just because you are smart enough to teach ur kids not to eat glass doesnt mean everyone else is i guess LMFAO.", "Maybe the kid dropped food by it and it got on the food.", "And it would\u2019ve been his mothers fault for not watching her kid and letting him in a room she should know isn\u2019t hers to enter. It\u2019s not her house either so her little kids shouldn\u2019t have been running around unsupervised if they aren\u2019t grown enough to know not to put glass in their mouth at 6 years old", "And the door was locked safeguarding the kids from that.", "Huge deflection from you here. You were reaching when you said they need to get into her room \u201cin case something falls on the roof\u201d. Someone is in the hospital because negligent parents broke into their kid\u2019s room for no reason and let young children play there unattended. Yea buddy, your reaching pretty hard. The whole comment section disagrees with you, I wonder why\u2026\u2026", "Door was locked and OP is entitled to privacy. So mom nor anyone else should have been in the room.", "If she locked a pet in her room all day with glass on the floor knowingly then yes that would be her responsibility because she knowingly left both glass and a pet in the room. \n\nShe didn\u2019t leave her door unlocked, she didn\u2019t leave her nephew in her room, and her mother knew she wasn\u2019t home and knew there would be no one in the room at the time so no it\u2019s not her responsibility because they should\u2019ve been WATCHING the child. There\u2019s no excuse to not watching him if he isn\u2019t trustworthy enough to be left unsupervised. And clearly if at 6 years old he\u2019s still eating shit he shouldn\u2019t be then yes, he should have eyes on him at ALL times. It\u2019s common fricken sense. \n\nShe did what she was supposed to by locking out the hazard away in a space that shouldn\u2019t have been entered point blank period. I have left broken Stuff on my floor before without telling anyone with the expectation I\u2019ll clean it when I get back and guess what? No one\u2019s been hurt because my space is respected and no one enters my room without permission and if they needed too they ALWAYS let me know and if somethings around I let them know to be careful, but if I don\u2019t expect someone to go into my room I\u2019m not gonna tell them \u201chey my bed is messy and I broke a candle\u201d because they shouldn\u2019t be in my room and if they got hurt that\u2019s on them for being somewhere THEY SHOULDNT BE in the first place.", "I agree, but again - no glass, no problem. Leaving broken glass around is stupid, full stop", "Sure, but adults can still get cut by broken glass\u2026", "I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re innocent, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s irresponsible to leave broken glass anywhere.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not reaching, everything that I posted has happened to people on a daily basis - thousands of people in the US alone have experienced the scenarios I\u2019ve described today.", "Again; there\u2019s a million reasons a home owner might need to pop into their kid\u2019s room unannounced that are totally benign and wouldn\u2019t be a violation of privacy", "holy shit. i\u2019m saying her door probably wasn\u2019t locked. shut up. bye.", "And adults should respect locked doors. There was clearly no emergency requiring access to the room so it should have remained locked and safe.", "Yeah, people unlock doors to check stuff. That's fair, but they usually lock it back up after, especially if they notice that there is glass on the floor that their child needs to pick up.\n\nLeaving your kids/grandkids in that same room that you know there is broken glass in, is child neglect.", "Please. If they needed to access the room, which. no reason has been offered by the homeowner why they needed go in, deal with issue, LOCK DOOR ON WAY OUT. It's on whomever let the 6 year old in.", "Besides a damn fire, roof falling or something crazy like that then no there isn\u2019t especially at 16. \n\nA 16 year old doesn\u2019t need their room cleaned, their laundry done, trash taken out their room etc, so therefore there\u2019s absolutely no valid reason to need to enter someone\u2019s room WITHOUT permission period. Give people the same respect and privacy you want because if someone comes into my room without permission and touching my shit idc who you are ima go into yours and fuck with your shit because you disrespected me by coming into MY room. \n\nSome of you parents are so entitled to your kids space and privacy and autonomy because your a parent and I will never understand that. My parents never did that shit and I sure as hell don\u2019t do it"]}
