Anyway, several things about this scenario bother me: 1) You locked your door and your sister's TWO children were allowed into your room unsupervised. Why? Is this a thing? Even if there wasn't glass on the floor, I don't see any good reason they would be in your bedroom. I can't imagine you have a bunch of kids' toys in there for them to play with, and if they don't live there, why would they expect to play in someone else's space? 2) This happened during the day and you didn't learn about it until you got home that evening and got scolded. That means that they found the boy, took him to the hospital, and got him stitched up without notifying you that any of this had happened, but operating on the assumption that it was your fault. How did they know you'd knocked over the glass? for all they knew, it was set near the edge of the desk and tumbled over at some point during the course of the day. It's weird that they were both so quick to blame you and so slow to inform you about something they think you're responsible for. 3) Six-year-olds should know better than to eat off the floor, and they should definitely know better than to eat glass. I could see your sister being angry if the boy had cut his foot, but how did she now raise him to know that glass isn't edible? He ought to know better. 4) It was your mother who told (scolded) you about the incident, not the parent of the injured party. It seems like something your sister would want to address herself, seeing as it's her child who got hurt. 5) I don't know your life, but considering you're  worried about job security, I don't expect you have a lot of extra cash lying around for someone else's medical bills. It's inconsiderate to expect you to pay for it and tacky to ask. I'm sorry that this is your family.", "NTA. Stress the fact that you locked the door.\n\nYou took proper precaution to ensure no one gets hurt from the glass.\nWhomever opened your door not only invaded your privacy, but they didn\u2019t do their due diligence before allowing children into the room.

And at 6yo? They really shouldn\u2019t be at the stage where putting everything in their mouth is still a habit.. what sort of parent allows such a habit to go on for so long? \n\nAlso, how do they know the kid didn\u2019t just break the glass and eat it? If you didn\u2019t tell anyone that you had broken the glass, then shouldn\u2019t the assumption be that the kid did it by himself? In which case?? Why would you be responsible? Unless someone opened the room, saw the broken glass and let the kids in anyway. \n\nEither way, it\u2019s absolutely not your fault.
