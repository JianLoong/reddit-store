I assumed my mom let Ally know but when we showed up, Ally was surprised to see us.\n\nShe was wearing sweats and a tank top, her hair was a bit knotted and she had a messy make up look. We also heard her kids chatting in the back. My mom asked why the kids were at home and why she looked a mess. Ally said that she had to have them by her side today and she absolutely couldn\u2019t send them to school. She also said she just woke up and that her kids did her make up. I didn\u2019t question her reasoning. \n\nMy mom made a face and was like \u201cyou\u2019re not setting a very good example for your boys, don\u2019t you think?\u201d \n\nAlly immediately started to get upset so I discreetly told my mom to back off  but she wouldn\u2019t listen. My mom started to say that she wouldn\u2019t do anything but if someone else heard that she kept the boys from school just because then they might call CPS.\n\nAlly insisted it wasn\u2019t just because so my mom told her to explain why.

While we were driving back, my mom yelled at me for humiliating her and for making her sound stupid and emotional. She claimed that I\u2019m acting just like my dad and I betrayed her. She even told me to stop the car so she could walk home just because she didn\u2019t want to be in the presence of a rude daughter.

Your mom was shaming your cousin and trying to condescendingly humiliate her; she doesn\u2019t get to cry foul when she gets humiliated by being called out for it.\n\nAlso, get ready. She\u2019s gonna lay into you for \u201cletting\u201d her walk home.", "NTA, but your mom is for judging your aunt.  She may say she isn't,  but no one who wasn't judging would bring up CPS.  And bringing up CPS was a horrible thing to do.", "Holy crap, your mom's a nightmare. She wasn't meddling -- She was flat out bullying someone she knew was feeling down. I highly suspect she KNEW she'd catch something she could disapprove of simply because she didn't call ahead. Her plan backfired on her so she's now mad at you. \n\nNTA. For what it's worth, I'm really, really proud of you for standing up to your mom.", "NTA\n\nWho would call CPS for 2 little kids staying home from school one day with their Mom? That\u2019s not even a reasonable statement. Your mother way over-stepped boundaries.", "NTA-your mom was incredibly rude.", "NTA. I'd have driven five miles out of my way and then kicked her out of the car to give her time to reflect on what she'd said.", "NTA. It's no one's business how yuor cousin raises her kids unless there's clear signs of neglect and/or abuse, which it seems in this case there wasn't. I would question your mom's actions around the entire event, before, during, and after. You made the assumption that your mom had told your cousin you were coming over, but it turned out she hadn't. Is it possible that your mom has a low opinion of your cousin to begin with, and wanted to catch her at a bad time in a twisted effort to \"prove\" she's a bad mother? From now on if you have an agreement with your mom to visit *anyone*, YOU make sure to call them and see if the intended day is ok for them. Then you can say to your mom, \"I called X and they said Saturday would be better than Tuesday, so let's make it a lunch date for next Saturday.\"", "NTA. Your mom sounds crazy.", "NTA, your mom has issues.", "NTA, but your mom is.  Does Ally have some kind of history that would make her keeping the kids home worrying?  If not, I don't see how it's any of your mom's business. And if Ally does have a concerning track record that was not the way to address it.  CPS, my goodness, I'd never let that person near me or my kids again if I could help it. Getting those people involved should be an absolute last resort and missing school isn't that. \n\nI don't know how a parent goes about signing a kind up for homeschooling, but seeing as that's an option, I don't think a kid not being in school is necessarily any form of child abuse. And I knew plenty of kids whose parents took them out of school for weeks at a time for vacation and what not. Who give a crap about a single day?", "NTA. Your mom IS extra. Ally just needed help. Your mom decided to be judgy and was pissed that you shut her ridiculousness down. Obviously you inherited common sense, empathy and level headedness from your dad.", "NTA. Your mom is... something. I'd tell your aunt.", "NTA\n\nYour mother's definitely a drama queen using words like humiliating and betrayal for essentially being slightly embarrassed because of her own actions.\n\nI don't think you should have handled the situation any other way because your actions mean your cousin knows you have her back, which I think she needs if she's been having a tough time.", "Your mom sux", "NTA who the hell asked for your moms opinion. NO ONE.  People need to mind their business and STFU", "NTA. Your mom was severely out of line.", "NTA. Shaming a young mother going through trauma  without showing an ounce of compassion when coming over virtually unannounced? Yeah, your mom is the asshole here and probably the asshole in general. That sounds like a rough childhood. You're a good friend and cousin for breaking that up. If you can, it would probably be really beneficial to your relationship and your cousin's wellbeing to be in touch and ask to have a private visit soon. Sometimes just asking to come over and talk while you do someone's dishes is a good way to make their lives easier.", "NTA\n\nIt appears you made a gut check to veto your mother in the immediate situation out of concern that her conversation was retraumatizing to your cousin. This was the correct decision.\n\nYour mother is, of course, not wrong in her concerns, but there is a time and place for everything. And an appropriate tone.", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with missing a day of elementary school in the midst of a family emergency, and sticking up for your sister in that situation wasn't a betrayal. Your mom's a hot ass mess.", "Your cousin needed someone to go in to bat for her, and you did. Your mum wouldn't have this problem if she hadn't been so hell-bent on kicking your cousin while she was clearly down. \nNTA - actually, you're the hero.", "NTA. Your mom was behaving horribly.
