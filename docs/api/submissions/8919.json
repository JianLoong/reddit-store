While we were driving back, my mom yelled at me for humiliating her and for making her sound stupid and emotional. She claimed that I\u2019m acting just like my dad and I betrayed her.

It's no one's business how yuor cousin raises her kids unless there's clear signs of neglect and/or abuse, which it seems in this case there wasn't. I would question your mom's actions around the entire event, before, during, and after. You made the assumption that your mom had told your cousin you were coming over, but it turned out she hadn't. Is it possible that your mom has a low opinion of your cousin to begin with, and wanted to catch her at a bad time in a twisted effort to \"prove\" she's a bad mother? From now on if you have an agreement with your mom to visit *anyone*, YOU make sure to call them and see if the intended day is ok for them.

CPS, my goodness, I'd never let that person near me or my kids again if I could help it. Getting those people involved should be an absolute last resort and missing school isn't that. \n\nI don't know how a parent goes about signing a kind up for homeschooling, but seeing as that's an option, I don't think a kid not being in school is necessarily any form of child abuse.

I'd tell your aunt.", "NTA\n\nYour mother's definitely a drama queen using words like humiliating and betrayal for essentially being slightly embarrassed because of her own actions.\n\nI don't think you should have handled the situation any other way because your actions mean your cousin knows you have her back, which I think she needs if she's been having a tough time.", "Your mom sux", "NTA who the hell asked for your moms opinion.

That sounds like a rough childhood. You're a good friend and cousin for breaking that up. If you can, it would probably be really beneficial to your relationship and your cousin's wellbeing to be in touch and ask to have a private visit soon.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s terrible that she took a lazy day and let her kids have a rare day off.

They can\u2019t seem to resist that mean little urge.", "ESH. Your mum needs to stay in her lane and not use CPS as a threat.

You did good.  Try to go without her next time.", "NTA. Thank you for standing up for your cousin, I\u2019m sure that she could use all the support she can get right now. It was very rude of your mom to make those comments, especially to a mother who is clearly struggling. I would suggest checking up on her if you feel comfortable with that, but stand your ground. Your mom is not right for making those comments to someone.", "NTA judging from the post I can assume your father left your mother and I can see why he did.

Thank you for defending Ally and standig up for her when she is in a weakend state.", "NTA and your mom made herself sound, 'stupid and emotional\".  You said your cousin recently went through a traumatic event.  What is wrong with mom? Whatever, the event, your cousin wanted to spend time with her children.  To accuse her of \"not setting a very good example for your boys\" was a bit harsh.  One day does not trigger a CPS investigation.  Now, if this becomes the norm, the school will notify CPS for truancy.", "NTA, your mom sounds like a peach. The one that fell off the tree six weeks ago and turned into a battleground between wasps and fire ants.", "Fwiw, Ally might need your family to provide more help to get her through this period.

It\u2019s one day, give or take. I\u2019m sure the 6yo will get caught up on how to spell \u201ccat\u201d and the 8yo will learn the Capitol of California is Sacramento soon enough. When I was in sixth grade, my mom had a miscarriage. She was inconsolably hysterical, and while I was confused and hurt at the loss of a little brother or sister, she was not ok. She kept me home from school on Thursday and Friday because she really needed to be around her son, and by the time Monday rolled around, she was much more able to face the world. I\u2019m really fucking glad she did, and I still managed to read chapter 6 of whatever book and pass my Algebra quiz on Monday. If Ally is holding them out for more than a day or two, if she starts doing this periodically; then you\u2019d have a point. But we don\u2019t have any information to substantiate anything of the sort. Whatever trauma Ally endured, if she needed a day or two with her family to help restore her mental health, then who cares?

But you don\u2019t have the information to support such a claim. Either way, OP\u2019s mom would remain the asshole, as shaming people is neither a healthy nor productive means by which to help someone appropriately deal with their trauma.\n\nLiterally all we know is that Ally suffered some sort of trauma. We don\u2019t know the nature or degree of that trauma, and we don\u2019t know to what extent that trauma impacted the children. As far as I\u2019m concerned, families should be *empowered* to take time away from work and school to heal from trauma together if they deem it necessary; not judged by strangers who have next-to-no idea what\u2019s going on.", "Just as you speculated this won\u2019t have any effect on the kid\u2019s education\u2026you know\u2026something past that one day\u2026. You don\u2019t have the information to support such a claim.\n\nDoing something bad doesn\u2019t magically become not bad because you\u2019ve only done it once and haven\u2019t done it more - possibly (since you really hate speculation) yet.\n\nThis not families being empowered to take time to heal, this the mom doing that herself and using her children as the tools to do so.  That\u2019s too much emotional weight to put upon a kids shoulders."]}
