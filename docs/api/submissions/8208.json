He then proceeded to convince me that it is not strange and that when he thought the same and told her that, she said it was normal and she didn't have any reason to see a doctor for it. \n\nI thought he was joking or something but he seemed serious. I continued to say it was really strange and he should be concerned for her and concerned with the fact that she argues it's normal. At that moment,I was shocked and concerned that my friend was an idiot or something. But I shut up about it when he got visibly angry. I just ended it with saying \"just google it dude.

That'd be 8 times in 16 waking hours.", "I don\u2019t even know what to say to this? Peeing once a day or every other day is not normal at all.. and she should see a doctor and/or drink more water.

Girl needs medical attention.", "I'm torn.\n\nYou're right that it's strange but I think you probably should have dropped it when she said it was normal.\n\nI think she's lying.\n\nAnd if she's not, she's probably got an eating disorder.", "NTA.

That is not normal at all to pee so few times a day/every other day. Even 4 could be considered low end I'd think for daily lol That he thinks that's not normal is concerning. Is he going to try holding it in for an entire day so he's not abnormal?", "It sounds like you were trying to express concern for your friend's girlfriend's health and well-being, but your friend interpreted your comments as judgmental or dismissive of her condition.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to remember that every person's body is different and what may be \"normal\" for one person may not be the same for another. It's also important to consider that your friend's girlfriend may have a medical condition that affects her urinary frequency and that it's not something that should be dismissed or trivialized.\r  \n\r  \nIn this situation, it would have been better to express your concerns in a more sensitive and empathetic way. Rather than saying \"that's not normal\" or \"she should go to a doctor\", you could have said something like \"that sounds unusual, have you considered talking to a doctor about it? It might be worth getting checked out to make sure everything is okay.\" This way, you are still expressing your concerns but in a more understanding and supportive way.\r  \n\r  \nIt's also important to remember that your friend may be defensive about his girlfriend and may have taken your comments as a personal attack on her. It's understandable that he would be upset and that he would feel that you were acting like you know everything about her and what is normal and what isn't.\r  \n\r  \nIt's not clear if you are the asshole (TA) or not, but it's important to consider how your words may have been perceived by your friend, and to try to express your concerns in a more supportive and understanding way in the future.", "This sounds like a presentation issue. So much of asshole behavior isn't so much about the facts as much as how you get things across. If it was legitimately presented as nah, your gf is weird, or in a way that came across as accusatory somehow, YTA or ESH. If it came from a place of genuine concern and was presented as such, obviously NTA.", "NTA, and that is coming from someone who has personal experience with a very similar conversation/situation (with me being the person in your friends GF position).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis feels a bit odd to share in this context but here goes:\n\nI have been in recover for an eating disorder for over a decade and didn't realize I was also taking in so very liquid on a regular basis. A few years ago I made a joke to someone about how it seemed like they and many other people peed a lot more than me and when I said I usually only peed once a day they said that seemed concerning and I was probably really dehydrated. I said that wasn't possible because I had been like this for as long as I could remember (and honestly felt somewhat defensive about it)... and then looked into it and talked to a doctor and it turns out I had most likely been chronically dehydrated (to a worrisome/dangerous degree) for YEARS. I was able to work on drinking more water and not only do I pee a more \"normal\" amount, it has made a big (positive) difference in how I feel physically day to day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou were surprised/concerned about something that it is fair to be surprised/concerned about. Absolutely NTA and if she is having health issues of any kind I hope she gets the help she needs.", "Nta for being concerned. I can hear that girl's kidneys crying from my house.", "NTA. Definitely not normal and she SHOULD see a doctor. I\u2019m probably over 10x per day!", "I just\u2026\n\nI can\u2019t even\u2026\n\nWHAT?!?\n\nNTA. She needs to see a doctor.", "In one of these people who pee once, maybe to twice a day. I drink plenty of water and other liquids during the day. I've never had bladder infections or other problems. Some people are just born with bladder of steel...it's incredibly helpful for long distance flights.", "NTA. She's probably on meth. I was on meth for 3 years (been clean for a year now) and that's common for people that use it. Weird fact for the day: A strange side effect because of meth for most people is you don't drink enough water and live in a chronic state of dehydration. It's not that you don't get thirsty but rather you just straight up forget to drink fluids at all and that's super common for people that use it daily. Strange but true. Don't ask me why cause I have no clue. But when I was on it,  I would only pee once a day because of it. Moral of the story: Stay of drugs kids! Lol.", "I was thinking the same thing. Plus if I have an extra cup of coffee in the AM I could probably go 4 times before 10 am. Once every other day is wild.", "Haha are you me!", "Idk, if he knew something like that, why'd he bring it up and say that he pees too much and then argue it's because she doesn't pee as much?", "HAHAHAHA. This is such a bizarre story. I absolutely love the hilarious things people argue about. \n\nThat girl should absolutely go see a doctor or drink more water. Lolll", "I need to make clear she wasn't there, he was just telling me what she told him. The biggest issue for me was that she somehow convinced him it is so normal that he now thinks peeing 4+ times a day is \"too much\".", "As a dialysis nurse, this post makes me cringe a little. \n\nOP, YNTA if you went about it in a nice way and seemed genuinely concerned.", "Exacuse me while I go void my bladder.", "I hope that he is just embarrassed for being dumb but it doesn't seem like the case. I've been worried for him since then because he might be just be too dumb or something.

And now she somehow convinced him it is normal and he feels like he pees too much.\n\nWe're friends and talk pretty bluntly but respectively to eachother. I had no reason to think this was such a delicate matter to him and think deeply about how I was gonna word everything.", "I was shocked and concerned. I was chuckling with disbelief when he started arguing that it's normal because I couldn't tell if he was joking or not, but quickly stopped when I realized he was for real.", "I'm glad you realized that early on before any serious problems. If it was just his gf thinking she was normal in that regard, I'd understand her being defensive, but the fact the my friend decided that she is in the right and that me and him are the weird ones for peeing 4 or more times a day is very worrisome.", "He's probably pissed (ha) because of a combination of 1) feeling embarrassed/dumb for not realizing he does in fact pee like a normal person and 2) now being in this weird situation where his gf won't talk about her own obviously abnormal peeing behavior.", "Definitely needs to hydrate.  \nBut why does the BF think this is normal?  Surely he\u2019s been urinating on a regular basis for 22 years!", "Honestly I\u2019m not even sure four times a day is enough?", "I read this in Jimi Hendrix's voice a' la excuse me while I kiss the sky. 10/10", "Same!!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I fully agree! I can sympathize with her defensiveness but her and your friend believing that is not healthy for either of them.", "Maybe he just like... thinks that's how girls work? Who knows. Logic doesn't live here. Haha", "I think ideally it should be 6, but we pee 4 or more times. I think that's normal, or at least, definitely more normal than once or every other day."]}
