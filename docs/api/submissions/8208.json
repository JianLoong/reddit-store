What people think of as hunger, is usually really thirst.", " I know a girl on TikTok who used to hold her pee and now is in kidney failure\u2026", "Yes I had kidney failure and as I got worse, I was only peeing once or twice a day. Once I was on dialysis I didn\u2019t pee at all.\n\nYou don\u2019t always get symptoms/feel unwell with kidney failure (I didn\u2019t, I had a shock diagnosis). \n\nIf she does have this, she could be walking around with dangerously high potassium levels or blood pressure which could be fatal - she could literally have a heart attack at any minute. \n\nPlease tell your friend to tell her to get herself checked out immediately. It could save her life", "Yeah, that's *beyond* concerning.", "Or something completely unexpected. For example, Ehlers-Danlos-Syndrome is a connective tissue disorder, but one of the symptoms is not feeling thirst properly. (I\u2019m currently waiting for an official diagnosis and at some point was drinking as little as half a litre a day because I just didn\u2019t notice.)", "Yeah, the only time I peed that little I was pregnant and had such bad hyperemesis that I hadn't peed in 3 days because I hadn't been able to go more than 20 minutes at a time while awake without vomiting. Told my GP who shipped me off to hospital for a week to get me rehydrated.", "good grief. that's terribly sad.", "Holding it in is sometimes a symptom of ocd and other mental illnesses", "Makes you wonder if she was often in situations where she wasn't allowed to go to the toilet and had to hold it in, eg in school and not allowed to take bathroom breaks, or long car journeys. As a culture we're too often encouraged to ignore our bodily needs, and while it is sometimes necessary to do so, doing it all the time is unhealthy and puts additional stress on your body.", "As a dialysis nurse, this post makes me cringe a little.", "OP, I would say show this comment to your friend. Even if he's interpreting you wrong, it's not a joke. This really could be a serious issue", "It is, honestly she's very real with everyone and I've absolutely cried watching some of her stuff. She's so so happy to have a legacy of convincing people not to hold their pee in to save others, I just wish the best for her. She already had kidney transplants and they failed, so now she's just doing her best to keep going as long as she can, but she is realistic about how difficult it is living your life around dialysis.\n\nShe's one of the most down to earth tiktokers I've ever seen. She's not even doing it for donations or anything.", "Text him saying that you didn\u2019t mean to pry or offend him but that you are genuinely worried about his gf\u2019s health. If she poops once a day or every two days it\u2019s fine and probably a misunderstanding but not peeing for such long stretches of time is very dangerous and should be addressed asap. If he doesn\u2019t respond, you did your most and he is a (proud) idiot, if he does you might find out it was a misunderstanding or that she in fact has a health issue and good on you for caring about it.", "I take a medication that, among many other lovely side effects, makes it difficult for me to tell if I need to pee. My doctor said I should just get up and pee every 2-3 hours during my waking day, whether I feel like I need to or not, because that's about how often I should. Make of that what you will.", "[bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10knqld/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_his_girlfriends/j5rtiz6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)", "Anyone only peeing once a day should be in the ER.", "a friend once told me one of the worst things about her pregnancy was needing to pee more & more often as the months went by, when she was of course getting bigger & bigger and had a harder time getting up to walk to the bathroom.\n\nreason #804 why i never wanted to have kids haha", "this makes me think about one of my biggest 'pet peeves' (for lack of a better word) ... how so many people either refuse to be, or just don't even THINK about being, organ donors. i know there are some countries that make organ donation an 'opt out' situation and i really wish it was the same in the US. if a person has some, i don't know, religious belief or whatever that makes them not willing to donate their organs, ok fine whatever. i don't get it, but of course everyone should have the right to do whatever they want with their bodies. but when i think about all the people who die needlessly every single day because they can't reach the top of a transplant list, it's just so awful.", "So, every 3 hours, assuming an 8 hour sleep cycle, is ~ 5 times a day. And using the 2-3 hours, it\u2019s probably more like 6 times, for the average person, as OP said.\n\nSo 4 or more times a day isn\u2019t wildly weird. Maybe a little bit dehydrated if it\u2019s a more \u201c4\u201d day, instead of a \u201cor more\u201d day but not dangerously so.", "My wife was peeing almost hourly in the third trimester of her pregnancy. Said she could feel the baby just constantly pushing on her bladder.", "It's interesting that dead bodies have more body autonomy than women do in parts of the US. But a lot of US laws are hypocritical like that so I can't say I'm surprised.", "i can believe it. ugh. it amazes me to think about how uncomfortable pregnancy must be. had i, for some reason, been forced to experience it, i swear i'd have become a sniper or something.", "i was thinking the same thing as i was writing that sentence."]}
