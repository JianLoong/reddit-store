That is not normal at all to pee so few times a day/every other day. Even 4 could be considered low end I'd think for daily lol That he thinks that's not normal is concerning. Is he going to try holding it in for an entire day so he's not abnormal?", "It sounds like you were trying to express concern for your friend's girlfriend's health and well-being, but your friend interpreted your comments as judgmental or dismissive of her condition.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to remember that every person's body is different and what may be \"normal\" for one person may not be the same for another. It's also important to consider that your friend's girlfriend may have a medical condition that affects her urinary frequency and that it's not something that should be dismissed or trivialized.\r  \n\r  \nIn this situation, it would have been better to express your concerns in a more sensitive and empathetic way. Rather than saying \"that's not normal\" or \"she should go to a doctor\", you could have said something like \"that sounds unusual, have you considered talking to a doctor about it? It might be worth getting checked out to make sure everything is okay.\" This way, you are still expressing your concerns but in a more understanding and supportive way.\r  \n\r  \nIt's also important to remember that your friend may be defensive about his girlfriend and may have taken your comments as a personal attack on her. It's understandable that he would be upset and that he would feel that you were acting like you know everything about her and what is normal and what isn't.\r  \n\r  \nIt's not clear if you are the asshole (TA) or not, but it's important to consider how your words may have been perceived by your friend, and to try to express your concerns in a more supportive and understanding way in the future.", "This sounds like a presentation issue. So much of asshole behavior isn't so much about the facts as much as how you get things across.

A few years ago I made a joke to someone about how it seemed like they and many other people peed a lot more than me and when I said I usually only peed once a day they said that seemed concerning and I was probably really dehydrated. I said that wasn't possible because I had been like this for as long as I could remember (and honestly felt somewhat defensive about it)... and then looked into it and talked to a doctor and it turns out I had most likely been chronically dehydrated (to a worrisome/dangerous degree) for YEARS. I was able to work on drinking more water and not only do I pee a more \"normal\" amount, it has made a big (positive) difference in how I feel physically day to day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou were surprised/concerned about something that it is fair to be surprised/concerned about. Absolutely NTA and if she is having health issues of any kind I hope she gets the help she needs.", "Nta for being concerned. I can hear that girl's kidneys crying from my house.", "NTA.

She needs to see a doctor.", "In one of these people who pee once, maybe to twice a day. I drink plenty of water and other liquids during the day. I've never had bladder infections or other problems. Some people are just born with bladder of steel...it's incredibly helpful for long distance flights.", "NTA. She's probably on meth. I was on meth for 3 years (been clean for a year now) and that's common for people that use it. Weird fact for the day: A strange side effect because of meth for most people is you don't drink enough water and live in a chronic state of dehydration. It's not that you don't get thirsty but rather you just straight up forget to drink fluids at all and that's super common for people that use it daily. Strange but true. Don't ask me why cause I have no clue. But when I was on it,  I would only pee once a day because of it. Moral of the story: Stay of drugs kids! Lol.", "I was thinking the same thing. Plus if I have an extra cup of coffee in the AM I could probably go 4 times before 10 am. Once every other day is wild.", "Haha are you me!", "Idk, if he knew something like that, why'd he bring it up and say that he pees too much and then argue it's because she doesn't pee as much?", "HAHAHAHA.

If it was just his gf thinking she was normal in that regard, I'd understand her being defensive, but the fact the my friend decided that she is in the right and that me and him are the weird ones for peeing 4 or more times a day is very worrisome.", "He's probably pissed (ha) because of a combination of 1) feeling embarrassed/dumb for not realizing he does in fact pee like a normal person and 2) now being in this weird situation where his gf won't talk about her own obviously abnormal peeing behavior.", "Definitely needs to hydrate.  \nBut why does the BF think this is normal?

If she's lying, it makes sense that she'd make BS reasons why she doesn't talk about it with her doctor. If she's not, she should be urged to see her doctor. \n\nYour friend isn't very smart, sad to say it. You're right: Google it or something. He was probably embarrassed for second-guessing himself on something so basic as \"what is a normal amount of times to pee a day.\" \n\nI'm a clown and honestly I'd have diffused the tension on that front a little bit with a joke. Not to say you were an AH not to, but it may have helped avoid this conflict over a conversation that really shouldn't be upsetting anyone (except concern for gf).\n\nYou sound kind of young.

This is def not normal and needs to be thoroughly examined by a medical professional.", "NTA, as a person who can go there days with out peeing (yes, 3 days), that isn\u2019t normal and it\u2019s actually dangerous. When we don\u2019t pee regularly out bladder expands to compensate the extra pee leading to horrible stomach pains.

Praying for her", "So I googled how much and how often healthy people pee. An average healthy person in an average climate who doesn't do anything extreme produces  800 to 2,000 milliliters of pee per day. You pee 250 - 400 mls every go, so everything between 2 times/day to 8 times/day fall within \"normal\" range. However, you can pee much more depending on activity levels, climate, age, health, etc etc. Peeing less can negatively affect your health.\n\nThe gf needs to drink more and stop holding her pee.
