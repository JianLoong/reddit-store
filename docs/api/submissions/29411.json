It didn't take jail for me, but it's what worked for my younger brother. We were both addicts and he got locked up for about 5 days. It got him into drug court which definitely saved his live. It was something like 2 years of meeting with the drug court judge first weekly, then eventually biweekly after months of success. His case was dismissed on completion of the program and he's been clean even longer than I have now. If a crime has anything at all to do with drugs this is often an option in many places. You may be able to talk to the district attorney (or an assistant) explain that it's drug related and the judge may make him pay restitution as part of a drug court probation sentence. If you Google your county and drug court you'll likely find some info. I wish you the best of luck. While I never did anything this extreme to my parents, I sure put them through hell for 5 years. Fortunately I didn't die of an overdose like so many do and now 8 years on my relationship with my parents is once again wonderful, so there is hope for your family as well."]}
