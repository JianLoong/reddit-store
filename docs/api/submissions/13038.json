While we were waiting we felt a car bump us in the back. Not a big bump but enough to feel it. We both get out the car and you can clearly see something was wrong with the driver. He was slumped over the wheel. You can also clearly see his wife in the passenger seat leaning over to him and was upset. \n\nI called 911 because it is clear they need a ambulance. My sister is mad because her car was hit. I understand being upset but clearly there was something wrong with the driver. The wife gets out the car saying her husband needs help. I let her know that I was on the phone with 911. My sister is demanding her to give her insurance information. I kept telling my sister to stop and it is not the time for that. She goes to the back of her car and starts yelling about a mark on her car. It wasn\u2019t even that big. I have 911 on the phone. The wife is upset and I can\u2019t get a clear answer from her so I am telling the what the driver is doing. He is not responding but I can feel he has a pulse. \n\nThe ambulance and police get there and they are able to find out the driver is diabetic and passed out. My sister is with the police going off about how they hit her car and she wants the insurance information because they are at fault. Mind you at this point other people are out their cars trying to calm the wife down and I knew my sister had bottles of water in her trunk so I go to grab one to give to the wife. My sister sees me getting one and goes off about giving her the water and how they better get her car fixed. At this point I am pissed and told her to stop acting like a piece of s**t. They need help not who is your insurance company. \n\nThey got the husband in the ambulance and some person parked their car at the gas station and give the wife the keys. We are allowed to leave and while we driving back to my house she upset because she said I should not have talked to her like that in front of people. I told her she shouldn\u2019t have been acting like a ass. \n\nHer husband called me later telling me I am a asshole because I had no right to talk to her like that and I hurt her feelings. I really don\u2019t care and feel disgusted on how she acted. My husband said I was right but my mom said I should have told her in private. AITA?\n\n\n****EDIT:(UPDATE) I spoke to their daughter a hour ago. He sugar is coming down he is at 792. He is not out the woods yet. I will be taking them food in the morning. I know what it is like to be in the hospital with a love one. Eating is the last thing on your mind. I let the daughter know about the post. I wanted to let her know I was telling her fathers story. One thing I can say she really does not want to ever lay eyes on my sister.\n\nAs far as my mom and sister I really don\u2019t deal with them on that level. Us being in a car is rare. I was only with her because I had dropped my car off to be serviced. She works around the corner from the dealership and they were out of loaners and I didn\u2019t like the rental company they use. She was dropping me off to the one I like. After what happened I just wanted her to take me home so I can get away from her. If you guessed right she is the favorite so mom sees no wrong with the things she does.", "created_utc": 1679617151, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1202vml/aita_for_calling_my_sister_a_piece_of_st_for_how/", "score": 303, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was also coming down with a flu, it was cold and we were on the way to pick my brother up from practice (also it was the time when we were financially unstable, crappy times all in all) The other guy (poor guy, he just bought a car) was hands in the air, he could not believe what someone has done to his car. I was in the back seat crying, I was scared. \n\n\nThey worked it out, met up, my dad payed for his repairs.....and that guy.... *Apologised* to my father for over reacting.... He was sorry that I had to see that and was feeling bad for not realising I was there (of course he was shocked at the time, who wouldn't be) ... He was reasonable, crappy car accident, nothing major and two *normal people* worked it out in the end....
