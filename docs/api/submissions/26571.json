They asked to borrow it, you said yes, they owe it, that's all there is to it. If there's issues, they should communicate that with you. Just because your Sister was kind enough to house your other Sister does not mean she or anyone can take advantage of you or your finances/whatever else using that as a reason to make you feel guilty. \n\nAs for the meal though you would be putting them in an unnecessary stressful and awkward situation just because you weren't willing to talk to them about the borrowed money. \n\nIf the agreement is that you usually pay, they will be expecting that and given that they've had to borrow money you're fully aware they won't be able to afford to pay their part.
