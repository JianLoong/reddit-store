Just because your Sister was kind enough to house your other Sister does not mean she or anyone can take advantage of you or your finances/whatever else using that as a reason to make you feel guilty. \n\nAs for the meal though you would be putting them in an unnecessary stressful and awkward situation just because you weren't willing to talk to them about the borrowed money. \n\nIf the agreement is that you usually pay, they will be expecting that and given that they've had to borrow money you're fully aware they won't be able to afford to pay their part.

I'm not going to do mental debt accounting when someone I care about is in such dire straits that they need a very small amount of financial assistance relative to what my income is.\n\nLike yeah, I'm not going to just burn $50...but that's nothing in terms of helping out someone I care about.", "Just a \"we're not close, I can't take her in\" would be sufficient\n\nIt's easy to make some plausible excuse, act sad, and then tell them to take her in themselves if they can to shut down those types of conversations. \n\nHell, start hounding them for money on your sister's behalf, and they will be the ones avoiding the topic", "My family are awful and I have nothing to do with any of them. I can still recognise that family who support each other is a good thing. Perhaps more so because I don't have what too many people seem to take for granted. \n\nThat commenter sounds like a teenage edgelord anyway but why even bring up a NC situation when this clearly isn't one.", "No, actually, that would have been harder for me. \n\nYou don\u2019t know my struggles.", "Set the precedent for what? What point are you trying to make?", "Guessing you don't have any real friends who would drop everything to help you, or they haven't realized yet that you are not the type of person they should have as a friend.   I'm sure you think it's the government's responsibility, but also complain how big your tax bills are every year. Guess what, one of the reasons you pay so much in taxes is so the government can support people like OPs sister, when family turns their back on them. .  You are supporting everyone else's  disabled sibling, uncle, cousin, etc, whether you like it or not in the end.", "It's not though because he says he has a decent income and for most jobs you know a range of what the person earns. Especially his collegues will know he has more than enough money to help. \n\nAnd, no, those people would probably not take her in but that doesn't mean they wouldn't take in their family member and definitely won't prevent them from judging the OP hard (as they should).", "If you understand the utility of a \"plausible excuse\" then you also understand how fucked this behavior would be.\n\nWhatever you actually believe, I'm sad for you.", "Get therapy.", "You just skipped right over that \"unless someone is abusive or something\" bit.", "Did you actually read the post you're replying to?", "You should really read the comment you reply to. Its good practice.", "Yeah, did you read the second part of my sentence?", "Yeah I don't think his coworkers are going to really care about his family drama as long as he has some half plausible explanation", "Thanks, but I'm pretty happy with my life, and satisfied with my choices.", "This is a really great way of putting it.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like it, but sure", "Ah yeah, if I don't want to take care of my siblings, I need therapy. Got it."]}
