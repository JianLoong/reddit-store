{"id": 29001, "submission_id": "178s30g", "title": "AITA for leaving a wedding before the reception?", "selftext": "My spouse and our kids (4 and 2) were in a wedding recently, of a very close family member. The wedding took place 4.5 hours away from our home, and my spouse had to work a double shift (18 hours) in order to take the Friday before the wedding off so we could be there in time for rehearsal. After spending several hours in chaos, (because the bride and groom hadn\u2019t gotten much planning in before this time) my children were naturally hungry and grumpy and were being a general nuisance. The rental home we stayed in was terrible (long list of complaints) and nearly impossible to find, which only made things progressively worse. What was left of the evening (it was going on 8 pm when we finally found it) was spent in many tears and tantrums to get them in bed and asleep, followed by a long night of very little actual sleep. The morning of the wedding was spent rushing around, then getting lost trying to find a place to eat or at the very least get groceries to feed us, and naturally getting lost again trying to find our way back. Everything was rushed and last minute, which naturally made tempers high. Finally, the wedding hour comes, (at which point I will note that my kids still have not actually eaten, only snacked because we couldn\u2019t find an actual place with food) and my very tired, very hungry, and very shy 2 year old starts screaming. Since I was not in the wedding party, I grabbed the screaming child up and ran out to avoid disturbing the ceremony anymore than we already had. After the ceremony, my 4 year old started getting emotional over every single thing and barely made it through pictures before collapsing on the ground in tears. (We waited around for 40-45 minutes while the bride and groom took their individual pictures first, then included a few family members.) Now it was around 4:30 in the afternoon and both of my children were screaming. Having reached our limit, my spouse and I packed them up, wished the family well, and started our long journey home. Later that night, we received several texts saying we were selfish for leaving, that it wasn\u2019t about us, it was about celebrating the bride and groom and that the bride and groom were angry that we\u2019d left.

All the issues -poor sleep, lack of food, getting lost - were on you and no fault of the bride and groom. Why didn't you plan better? You made the trip to help them celebrate their marriage, you should have stuck it out for the reception. After all, the kids are going to GET FOOD THERE.", "YTA: As a parent i would never leave for a trip like they without a cooler of snacks, drinks and groceries for dinner that night and that morning. You had terrible planning and should be embarrassed. Your husband was in the wedding and missed the reception? have the two of you never travelled out of town before?", "INFO\n\nSo how long have you known about this wedding and why didn't you prepare for things?", "YTA - I get why you left.

I get you had a rough day and traveling with kids is difficult but it does sound like you didnt prepare well for this type of event.", "Listen, you\u2019re getting a lot of criticism here concerning food for your kids. I\u2019m a parent too, and criticizing another mom really sucks, but c\u2019mon. You *have* to plan for the unexpected. Snacks, drinks, *real food*, diapers, entertainment for the kiddos. \n\nYTA. \n\nYou *knew* you\u2019d be traveling at least 4 1/2 hours.

No. But it would have helped stave off the inevitable meltdowns.", "Little bit YTA for lack of planning\n\nMy kids are late teens and early 20s. When we travel together, I still pack them each a snack bag (even my future SIL) that has plenty of snacks that are geared towards them. We also travel with a cooler and everyone has their own reusable water bottle. I couldn\u2019t imagine not traveling with these things when they were little. \n\nFor future trips, pack snack bags that have sufficient food in it to make a finger food style lunch.

No wonder so many couples insist on child free weddings.", "YTA.\nYou should have planned MUCH better than you did.", "YTA - I understand why you left, but the only reason you ended up in that situation was your lack of planning, since the internet exists.

And then you have the audacity to make a jibe about the couple getting married not doing much planning?", "Very mild YTA. Why didn't you use google maps or something to find food??\n\nThe wedding party are completely nuts though.

Did they want to listen to the kids' have a full meltdown or something?  I really don't understand shallow, hedonistic twits like this.", "NTA - you took your upset and, probably disruptive, children away, I'm sure you would've receive many more complaints about your kids if you'd stayed and they continued to act out as they were tried and hungry.

Your kids aren't trained animals that can be rented for the enjoyment of the Bride and Groom of this story.\n\nNTA\n\nI'd have left that morning when I couldn't get breakfast for my family and anyone who complains I'd tell them to STFU.", "NTA They are right, the wedding isn't about you.  Anything following that statement is irrelevant.", "NTA. Your wife worked 18 hours just to go and was probably insanely exhausted and you were driving with children.  You could have had all the snacks you could pack and if a 2 and 4 year old are tired of riding in a car, sleep little due to different surroundings- what can you do? \nYou showed up.  You took care of your kids.  And so your overly tired and stimulated children did not ruin a ceremony and rehearsal you gave good wishes and then left to take care of your children.\nSeriously people are texting you from the wedding that you were selfish?  You left so you didn\u2019t ruin their wedding.  And the bride and groom were mad you left?  Are you David and Victoria Beckham and everyone came to just see y\u2019all? Are you telling me the bride and groom were taking attendance instead of celebrating with each other?  What the he!! is wrong with weddings today? You came. You celebrated.  Then you needed to excuse yourself and THE REASONS ARE NO ONES BUSINESS!!!\n\nIt sounds like a nightmare for you and your spouse, but you did your best.

If things are going south for whatever reason, a parent's first duty is to the kids, not a party.", "I agree - the parent\u2019s first duty was to the kids and it seems most people here are seeing how OP really dropped the ball here.
