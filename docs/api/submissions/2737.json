It pains me to call her my SiL because they\u2019re not officially married but their family ignores it.\n\nAnyway Sonia and I don\u2019t get along. I find her very obnoxious. She\u2019s the one with pretty clothes, cool job, interesting hobbies that she has time for because she doesn\u2019t want kids, time to do everything. She\u2019s always the centre of attention because everyone\u2019s interested in her. Am I jealous? Perhaps a bit, but I also believe that she\u2019s an awful influence to my children. Only this week, she went to a metal gig and came back with a sprained ankle (apparently it happened during mosh pit) and lost her voice. Obviously, everyone will be asking about that during thanksgiving and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for my kids to hear about things like that especially since she didn\u2019t even take her husband with her and went on her own (which is so weird. Why would you go alone?). \n\nPeople always ask her about everything she does (she\u2019s a published author, not a millionaire, well known one, but she still makes a decent living with her books) and everyone always asks her questions. It\u2019s so annoying and she won\u2019t stop them. And I often tried to change the topic and talk about my kids or our plans for o ur house (we\u2019re renovating) but no one is ever interested.\n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t see the problem but I feel pushed aside because of her.\n\nBecause of her coming back with a sprained ankle; etc, I decided that I\u2019ve had enough, she\u2019s a bad influence and I won\u2019t spend any more time with her.\n\nI told my husband that we\u2019re not going to spend thanksgiving with his parents if she\u2019s there. He tried to argue but I held strong. I told him that it\u2019s ridiculous she gets to behave like a child (seriously, concert and moshpit at her age?). He suggested I stayed home with kids and he\u2019d go otherwise it\u2019ll be disrespectful. And I said that SiL has been disrespectful for years but no one\u2019s done anything and it\u2019s my turn. I told him that we are married and he had to support me in this decision and stay home.\n\nHe called me a controlling bitch and called his brother bitching about me. I was furious and stomped inside his room and he told me that he is taking kids to the thangisong dinner but I can stay home. I said that he had no right to take the kids but he wouldn\u2019t budge and we argued.\n\nhe\u2019s been giving me silent treatement since. I spoke with my mother and she told me I should\u2019ve suffer through it because it\u2019s only a day and giving ultimatums wasn\u2019t okay. I have a hard time understanding why she thinks that so I need you, AITA for not wanting to attend thanksgiving with my SiL?", "created_utc": 1668880046, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzhlin/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_thanksgiving_with_my/", "score": 1951, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It pains me to call her my SiL because they\u2019re not officially married but their family ignores it.\n\nAnyway Sonia and I don\u2019t get along. I find her very obnoxious. She\u2019s the one with pretty clothes, cool job, interesting hobbies that she has time for because she doesn\u2019t want kids, time to do everything. She\u2019s always the centre of attention because everyone\u2019s interested in her. Am I jealous? Perhaps a bit, but I also believe that she\u2019s an awful influence to my children. Only this week, she went to a metal gig and came back with a sprained ankle (apparently it happened during mosh pit) and lost her voice. Obviously, everyone will be asking about that during thanksgiving and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for my kids to hear about things like that especially since she didn\u2019t even take her husband with her and went on her own (which is so weird. Why would you go alone?). \n\nPeople always ask her about everything she does (she\u2019s a published author, not a millionaire, well known one, but she still makes a decent living with her books) and everyone always asks her questions. It\u2019s so annoying and she won\u2019t stop them. And I often tried to change the topic and talk about my kids or our plans for o ur house (we\u2019re renovating) but no one is ever interested.\n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t see the problem but I feel pushed aside because of her.\n\nBecause of her coming back with a sprained ankle; etc, I decided that I\u2019ve had enough, she\u2019s a bad influence and I won\u2019t spend any more time with her.\n\nI told my husband that we\u2019re not going to spend thanksgiving with his parents if she\u2019s there. He tried to argue but I held strong. I told him that it\u2019s ridiculous she gets to behave like a child (seriously, concert and moshpit at her age?). He suggested I stayed home with kids and he\u2019d go otherwise it\u2019ll be disrespectful. And I said that SiL has been disrespectful for years but no one\u2019s done anything and it\u2019s my turn. I told him that we are married and he had to support me in this decision and stay home.\n\nHe called me a controlling bitch and called his brother bitching about me. I was furious and stomped inside his room and he told me that he is taking kids to the thangisong dinner but I can stay home. I said that he had no right to take the kids but he wouldn\u2019t budge and we argued.\n\nhe\u2019s been giving me silent treatement since. I spoke with my mother and she told me I should\u2019ve suffer through it because it\u2019s only a day and giving ultimatums wasn\u2019t okay.

Tell him that and the next time he calls you a female slur, you take your kids and go to your mothers. \n\n2. How is she a bad influence? All I see if you complaining that she doesn't have kids. I'm sorry but people are rarely interested in someone else's kids. Thats just how it is. She isn't a bad influence for following her passion and not having kids. Don't blame her for how your husband's family treats you, she is not the problem. \n\nI would recommend to get a hobby. The reason they aren't interested is because you are talking about your kids instead of yourself. You need something to show, like your sil has her books to show. Just being a mother, sadly, doesn't pay off socially. \n\nAnd don't just get a hobby but work on it until you are good at it. Make your own clothes, jewelry, write your own book, paint figurines, get into graphic novels, study a certian subject like history or law. A hobby isn't just good for talking about yourself but it also makes it easier for you to participate in conversation that isn't about you. \n\nAlso, work on yourself! This judgmental mindset has to go. \"Really? Moshpit? At her age?\" Is not okay to say or even think. Age has nothing to do with participating in and enjoying certain things. This is a defensive mindset and makes it harder for people to take interest in you. You might think others don't know what you are thinking, but they can very much feel it! Genuinely be happy for your sister in law and don't compare yourself to her! \n\nYou are your own person. You can't blame her for being more of an interest for other people because of her life choices.", "Wow.

The first step to getting over it is admitting it. You did that now fix what is missing from your life that bothers you.\n\nI don\u2019t like my SIL and I will admit at times I am jealous. Not for the reasons that you are but because she is a lost puppy with zero ability to function and everyone gives and does everything for her.

Very cringe and very immature.\n\nWhat she needs is to invest in good birth control and a good therapist or else risk becoming a single mother if she keeps trying to alienate her husband from his twin sibling.", "And calling her a crazy bitch. Was she being unreadable? Yeah, but degrading her isn\u2019t okay. She clearly needs to talk through her feelings about SIL and her own unhappiness with her life.

It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t miss him!", "My husband and I have been married for 19 years. We go on family vacations with our kids, couple vacations without the kids, and solo vacations.  We tout the benefits of solo vacations to all our friends. The main benefit is there's no need to compromise. I can do everything I want to do. Wake up and go to bed when I want to, eat when I want to, do whatever activities I want. I don't need to cut someone's food before I eat. I don't need to stop my conversation because someone needs to go to the bathroom. I don't need to wait for my husband to go to the bathroom to get going in the morning. (Why do men take so long to poop? Lol) I think that every couple should make time for solo vacations.", "Yeah I used to go to concerts alone in my early 30s before I met my husband, cause I\u2019m not gonna miss a band or artist I love just cause no one will go with me. He\u2019s luckily a trooper and goes to all shows with me now, but if he really didn\u2019t want to, I\u2019d go alone no question!", "I\u2019m in my 50s and last time I was in a pit (pre COVID) a girl slammed into me and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry mama!

Hopefully your daughter continues to express herself, it\u2019s boring to have to dull down your personality to meet someone else\u2019s expectations. It\u2019s completely possible to find professional careers that care about your performance rather than you fitting a mold. Also the elderly people I work with often, love my gaged ears. It\u2019s awesome.", "Pit Elders ! Love it (moshed to The Clash in\u201982)", "I feel like OP is mad that her kids are not the center of attention.

She\u2019s been pregnant more than not during the entire relationship and seeing someone with a 10 year relationship with no kids is doing her head in", "Yeah, that kind of thinking gives me you have to forsake anything you love because of \"kids\" and I am convinced that can lead to toxic parenting.  I was a caseworker and a radio was playing in the background and a metal song came on. And I was looking through my notes and the mother is all freaked out saying I am too old and talking about sacrificing everything for your kids etc. I had enough and said then why they are in state care if you are such a good mother and smacked your kid around for listening to an oldies radio station. It wasn't even religious it was just you have to give all that up.", "I'm sure she'll tell them how her \"not SIL\" is such a bad influence and made her hurt her hand. \ud83d\ude44", "I'm sure the Life Alert pendant will work in the mosh pit.

I guess it's possible that OP is just spectacularly insecure and un-self-aware.  I don't know. It just sounds like a parody.", "Does anyone else come here\u2026read something like this and then go I CANNOT WAIT to see OPs responses to comments / questions to only then be disappointed that it\u2019s been 11 hours and they haven\u2019t let anymore of their crazy show? Such a let down. \n\nOh btw OP YTA.", "Did you read what I read cause she is obviously jealous as hell of sil awesome life. She sounds jealous that sil doesn't have kids and that she can go do fun things like go to a metal show.

And now she's realizing even that didn't stop people from paying attention to other people, so now she's throwing a fit.", "Honestly if you like being the center of attention (which is fine), probably the worst thing you can do is have three small children. They're lil attention sponges.", "Oh no, what if OP gets to the big 4-0 and she's not a grandmother yet.
