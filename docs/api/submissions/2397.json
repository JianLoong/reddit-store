Our other children are ages 5F and 5M. \n\nTiffany and my mother have a complicated relationship for reasons in the past because of both of them. \n\nMy mother lives 5 hours away. \n\nI have a disease that I won't go into in detail, but because of it, I have severe migraine attacks that I've already stopped at the hospital, etc. I had one of them 2 weeks ago and I was in the hospital for 3 days and when I got home I was in bed in so much pain so I couldn't do something.\n\n Despite Tiffany's resistance, she agreed with my mother's help, as she was so overwhelmed with pregnancy, our dog and the twins. \n\nThe next two weeks were hell and I don't know how a war didn't happen, but yes, my mother helped a lot, the two of them don't get along at all.\n\n I got much better at the end of the second week and I suggested that my mother could come back to her house (edited I apologize for this part that may have gone wrong) if she wanted, to which she replied that she would like to spend more time with us to walk these last few days (she would stay 4 more).\n\n In the bedroom, Tiffany freaked out, saying she couldn't take it and all. I thought of something, I suggested that I could ask her to leave, but my mom would complain or I could give Tiffany a few days off, leaving her at the hotel with no responsibilities in those 4 days and my mom would complain anyway... So my mother complains, but with Tiffany relaxing in the hotel. \n\nShe started to complain that it was unfair for SHE to have to do this, but when she realized it was 4 days all inclusive and no responsibilities, she accepted. \n\nShe went to the hotel on Sunday and she is there. \n\nWhen my mom found out that Tiffany had gone to the hotel, she asked why and I said I wanted to give her a break and that it was tense these two weeks.\n\n My mother freaked out saying it was extremely rude, for a person to go to the hotel right when she said she would stay more days and that she also helped and I didn't even want to give her anything. \n\nI even offered to give her a spa weekend in the future, but it's still frothing to this day that I'm endorsing this kind of behavior from my wife and how disappointed she is that we did it.\n\n AITA?\n\nTA, Sorry for my english.\n\n#Let's go. \n\n#1. I didn't kick my wife out of the house, she is there because she wanted to rest. \n\n#2. The crises involve many trips to the hospital where I have to go home 1/2 days later, I often have to go to the hospital at dawn because of so much pain and I can't drive and someone has to come with me, because i can pass out. So it's hard to get a babysitter at the last minute who can go at 3 in the morning.\n#3. Yes, my wife didn't want to, but she saw that we COULDN'T play alone, the house has a cleaning lady, but it's a lot, because unfortunately I get very bad in crises and yes, I once suggested that my mother come, she I said I didn't want to, I RESPECT. But soon after, without me insisting, she told my mother to come, because it was one of my strongest crises. \n#4. We didn't really know for two weeks that this would last, it takes 7-10 days. Unforeseen happen unfortunately.\n#5. I didn't go behind my wife's back, we talked in the bedroom before any decision and she didn't want her to stay, that's fine. I only talked about the hotel, because my mother would complain about her leaving or her staying at the hotel, at least in the hotel she rests\n#6.

Was there nobody else that could've helped your wife? \n\nI personally wouldn't want help that comes with such strife. It sounds exhausting, so I'd rather struggle through on my own. At least then you don't have to walk on eggshells. So why did your wife agree? Did you push it?   \nIn other moments where the tension was raised, did you stand up for your wife? By your mother's response to you treating your wife, it appears that your wife has quite the battle ahead of her. Your mom sounds difficult and that's putting it mildly. \n\nWhat is the origin of their tension? Where did it start? Did they have an equal part in it?", "YTA for how you handled the situation. You shouldn\u2019t have gotten it to the point of having to talk your wife into a spa break.\n\nNTA for the spa break, though you could have set that up way better. What I find fascinating is how upset your mom is that your wife isn\u2019t there considering they don\u2019t get along. Reading between the lines, she may be the aggressor in the relationship. Your wife was happy to remove herself from the conflict, but your mom wanted to have your wife around to do - what?

I feel for you though. It's a tough situation.

Op what\u2026 you went behind your wife\u2019s back and allowed your mother to stay longer without consulting wife first then you basically kick your wife out of HER home.

It was good of you to give your wife time away to relax and decompress but the bottom line still stands that you really really didn't think this whole situation through.

You offered a compromise and let your wife make the decision.  From everything I read here, it sounds like you would have let your wife have the veto decision.

Having a pregnant wife leave her house to go to a hotel because she is apparently \"not alone\" at a hotel nearby so you can accomodate your mother. You should have put your wife and baby wellbeing first instead of let her go to hotel(regardless of her being alone or having companion). I suggests the wife files for divorce when she have the means to. Either way, your mother still manage to find things to complain about your wife, and you sent your pregnant wife away while you are fully aware of this. You claimed that you didn't go behind wife's back but this contradicts the fact that you gave your mother option to extend her stay without prior discussion with wife, causing wife to freak out. You denied kicking your wife out but you basically left her with no option but to go to some hotel to escape your mother's presence. It seems that you are also unable to say no to your mother. I don't find issue with how your wife acts. Avoiding your mother who picks on her is the best course of action for pregnant wife's health. Instead, your behaviour is the biggest problem here.

She is jealous that you gave your DW an all inclusive stay at a hotel, but would have complained that you did not want to spend 24/7 with her for another 4 days if you had offered the same for her.
