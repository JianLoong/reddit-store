This guy was clearly abusing his position of seniority to try to force you to do something that has nothing to do with your job and for reasons that aren't any deeper than wanting to control your behavior.

His manner was hostile, aggressive, and punitive. As others have said, yours probably wasn't the first complaint. That he lost his job is entirely down to him. \n\nAnd, for what it's worth, nobody should have let him find you to yell at you for his firing.
