The worse he got the more uncomfortable other people are about correcting him and letting him know that's not acceptable.  Plus, he likely saw (as do a lot of bullies) that people typically gave in to just stop the tantrum.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he's never physically hurt you.  That is emotional, mental, and verbal abuse.  It can cause emotional trauma just as physical abuse can.  I've read studies that state that it can, in some cases, be worse.\n\nI'm glad that your comment had the reaction of shutting him up.  Maybe now's the time to tell him some hard home truths... such as what you said in the OP.   \n\n\nNo adult should be behaving like this.", "Well he should start getting used to it. NTA and keep telling him.", "NTA\nYou surprised him for sure and the fact that he didn\u2019t yell back makes me think that you might have made him think about his nonsensical anger about the TV being to quiet even though he had the remote. Maybe you could try to open up a discussion with him since you have this new situation. I don\u2019t feel that you are at risk of being like your dad as far as having these intense anger issues just because you responded this way. It sounds really hard to live with.", "NTA\n\nSomeone that disrespectful has no business expecting respect. \n\nThat said, if you're brave enough to tell him to shut the fuck up, you should be brave enough to tell him his anger issues are out of control and he needs to get help for them.", "NTA and clearly he can control himself since he stopped immediately so this says he's basically just a self indulgent child who has never had anyone tell him no or been made to control himself. Good for you for standing up to him, keep up the good work.", "NTA and also you\u2019re not responsible for your mother.\nHow long do you plan to stay in that house ? You will leave at some point won\u2019t you ?", "NTA and applause. I lived far too long under fear of my father\u2019s rage. Now I tell him to shut up, stop acting like a child, etc. You should NOT have to live like that.", "NTA, but I think you need to move out. You're still young and should be starting your own life. If you wait too long, you'll end up wasting time that should be spent living your own life.", "NTA\n\nMaybe you could use a semi-apology as a starter in a conversation suggesting he needs help. 'i'm sorry i swore at you but you really are scaring us and i think you need to see someone about it' sort of thing. he sounds super scary and there def is sumthin off in his emotional regulation.", "NTA but for your own sake you need to GTFO. Get yourself a place away from your dad's abusive behaviour. It might be easier for your mom to leave too, if she knows she will have a place to go to get away from your father.", "Your mother needs a divorce and you both need to move out and go to therapy. Your father is dangerous. NTA", "umm... he may have something badly wrong with him, like a brain tumour.  Best if you check this out.", "YTA\n\nIt does appear that your outburst mirrors the behavior you say frightens you for your safety and that of your mother. I would argue that you should indeed move into your own place as your living there and his acquiescence to your mother's possible wishes that you be able to stay may be what's causing his distemper. \n\nMove out and start taking care of your own responsibilities as an adult and see if that doesn't improve the situation. If it doesn't and his temper begins to threaten your mother's safety, you'll have a safe place to provide for her in her time of need. If it does, you were the underlying problem who resolved themselves.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell him to get his ass into the corner and stare at the wall for ten minutes, because he is in time out.", "Well damn, you spoke openly to him about it one time and he changed. Maybe he'll listen to you where he wouldn't listen to mum. You're NTA for sure but perhaps you could try showing him some contrition (e.g. \"sorry I lashed out, it's just that \\[explain his pattern\\]\"). Maybe, at a calm moment and with him off-guard because you're mid \"apology\", you might be able to get through to him and persuade him to keep himself in check. He might not even need therapy, he might just need to *know* he's scaring his child who he loves, and that might be enough to make him reflect on his outbursts rather than habitually letting them spill out of him.", "NTA but you should move out.

The fact that he could and did stop when you got blunt with him shows it\u2019s psychological not psychiatric. Not uncontrollable. \n\nNTA", "Agreed. He deserves it and it works", "How about \"I'm sorry I **had to** tell you to shut up\"? I think that puts the ball in \"daddy's\" part of the court, where it belongs.", "I should clarify: this isn't a recent change, this has been happening for my whole life, my mum says he's always done it for as long as she's known him, and my grandma said that he's been like that his whole life. Regardless, he refuses to see a doctor for anything sadly.", "You mean to say that I'm the cause of my dad's anger? I had nothing to do with the TV being too quiet, or him dropping his keys. He's been like this for his whole life.", "I honestly wouldn't say that she's enabling him. She has tried everything she can to change him. She has made appointments for him that he hasn't shown up to. She's tried all of the tips you can find from psychologists online. She's tried shouting back at him and found that it doesn't stop him, it just makes him angrier. I really think she's tried her best.", "In my mums defense, she can't work due to being disabled so is pretty much completely reliant on me and my dad. She's not forcing me to stay, I should clarify that when she says she doesn't want me to leave, she does say it in a joking way, although I can tell its not a joke. She wants me to apologise to him so that he'll stop ignoring me, but I don't know if she's really upset that I said it, it's hard to tell what she's thinking, but I don't blame my mum at all, she's usually the one that stops his 'tantrums'.", "Obviously you are not the cause. They must not have read your post clearly.", "You seemed, in your original post, to be saying his temper flares are a recent and disturbing thing. Now it's been this way his whole life?  \n\nYes. I'm saying that your continued, dependent status in your parents' home may be the underlying issue that's making your dad short-circuit over apparently minor things.", "Thank you :)", "Sorry, I never said it was recent, I said \"for all the time I can remember\" which is my whole life. They've recently gotten harder to deal with because of changes in my own health. I also never said that I'm a dependent, I work, and as a household we are not short on money at all.", "OP is not the reason for her dad\u2019s anger/frustration outbursts as she clearly posted.", "I apologize, you did say as long as you can remember. However, I would still assert that your behavior mirrors his and that you should move into the adult world and take responsibility for yourself fully. You say you're not short of money at all (meaning your whole family isn't hard up for money, right?) However, you are not independent and you wouldn't likely be as financially comfortable on your own dime.", "The OP clearly posted her reasons/excuses for her outburst. She, nor you, nor I know for certain that she is not the underlying reason for her father's \"tantrums\".", "I earn more than my dad does, I could quite comfortably live on my own. And as for my behaviour mirroring his, this was one time, I've never shouted before and I most likely never will, because I can control my anger and I'm not an angry person in general.", ">She, nor you, nor I know for certain\n\nCorrect so why make this dumbass assumption in the first place?", "Earning more than one's father doesn't equate to living on one's own. And if you are able to live on your own comfortably, why haven't you moved out? You mom married your dad. Their relationship is their business and your mother clearly feels you've overstepped your position in the household regarding your outburst. She has expressed, or you perceive her as having expressed, concern that you share a very unpleasant disposition with your father. She's right. And since you live in their home, you should apologize and get out of their home and business. She'll come to you or a trusted friend, if she needs input into her relationship with your father.", "The OP mentioned that they realized moving out was an option. I suggest they take that option because it may very well solve the problem their dad is having and provide their mother with the help they feel their mother needs - as in a safe place to live. The OP has expressed their disinterest in taking care of their mother this way.", "I said in my post why i havent moved out. She very frequently expresses the desire to leave him, and tells me she doesn't want me to leave her alone with him. It's my home too, I was born there and it belonged to my grandparents previously.", "Your mom isn't doing you any favors, either. She's the one who is choosing to live and stay with your father, and by begging you to not leave her alone with him she's shackling you to him as well. And now you're a victim of both her enabling and passivity.\nI hope that, now that you're an adult and can bluntly call him out on his behavior, it can shock him into some actual self-reflection. But if it doesn't, please know that you don't have to live like this."]}
