Believe me when I say your disability is not the reason why you were chosen over your coworker. If this person can't hold their composure when they don't get their way, they are not receptionist material. That is a customer service job first and foremost, and they obviously don't have what it takes.", "NTA disability is a joke if you get approved you get a pittance and you can't have any assets. No one is owed a new position at work. The place you work chose to give you a new position to keep you with your new disability limitations. \n\nQuite frankly their ableist B.S is a huge red flag for people who work with the elderly.", "NTA report them, they are harassing you in your workplace. Your post is none of their business.", "NTA. If she has an issue with hiring, she can take it up with HR. Length of service does not dictate who is eligible for a role. And nothing gives her the right to mock your disibility. Personally, I would be reporting her to HR for bullying. You've definitely got grounds.", "Nta. Big time NTA\nYour coworkers seem lovely btw (sarcasm)", ">how she worked there longer so she should be first in line\n\nOf course not. That's not how life works. This lady is just jealous... weirdly. I am pretty sure she would gladly take the job, but not the disability.\n\nYour company CHOSE to keep you around because they value you. Not your fault, and you deserved it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - omg your co - workers ACTUALLY said that to you ? That sounds like terrrible place to work, period", "NTA but you should look into reporting your coworkers for harassment. If they say that so openly to you, their coworker, I can only imagine how horrible they treat your clients. \n\nIf this lady wants a receptionist job so badly she can go out and apply for one and take her nasty attitude with her.", "Yeah these are just AH people you work with. NTA.", "NTA. Record and document every single one of those people making those comments and report them for ableism. They work in a senior home for godsakes.", "NTA but I'm seriously concerned about every single one of these people working in a senior care facility. They bully you by saying you are like the residents? Rather than seeing the residents as individuals at the end of their lives they see them as their reduced ability.", "NTA.  You can\u2019t make everybody happy, nor should you exhaust yourself trying.", "NTA\n\nIf she had really wanted the job she would have applied for it.

She wouldn't have gotten the position anyway, sure to her attitude.", "If you're in the US, you probably can't \"just get disability\" since they typically make you fight through a TON of bureaucracy and routinely seem to reject the initial application and wait for the appeal to see if it's really serious (even where it clearly is).\n\nNTA either way, but it's not easy!", "Report them to HR immediately", "Also someone being that ableist should maybe not be working with potentially vulnerable people", "True I guess lol", "Yeah, I\u2019m having trouble even getting on food stamps bc we have 3 kids, so I think disability would be harder", "I was thinking about talking to my executive director about it, she\u2019s been really nice about having me back so I think she\u2019ll put a stop to it", "Lol some of them are nice.

Not someone who will go off on one and whinge me me me - that's no good for dealing with current and potential residents, visitors, and healthcare professionals there to do appointments.\n\nThe receptionist at the home I worked at was kind, friendly, and empathetic and it made a huge difference as she helped build bridges not burn them. Your coworker doesn't sound able to do that, and sadly sounds like some of my old coworkers.\n\nYou got the job because they think you'll do good, so take a deep breath, kick ass at that job, and report the harrassment.

Comments like that need to be mentioned incase the behaviour escalates but also because someone that ableist should not be in a position of care. Hopefully it's just jealousy and will get sorted by a small chat from the right person. But if its deeper feelings coming out then the boss needs to be aware and keep an eye on this. \n\nDon't feel bad about any of this. You didn't get the job over her, they specifically made space so they could keep you there. You had new limitations and they respect you so much as a worker that they ensured you could keep working there. With an attitude like hers, it's no surprise she is taking it the wrong way and seeing it as a personal attack but it was never anything to do with her. I understand the feelings you're going through, 2 members of my old team are no longer talking to me since I got a promotion they wanted. It's rough but just remember that your bosses and coworkers wanted you there.", "Thank you!!!", "Lol I\u2019ve never heard that!", "Haha, I actually do payroll for a senior living company, including MC, so I\u2019m well versed!", "NTA, being there longer doesn't entitle her to a thing.

Of course they're gonna be mad you got a position others have been waiting on but that isn't your fault. Odds are pretty great you'll be unpopular there but who cares make your money I'd just relax on the unnecessary crap.", "Alrighty, that makes sense.
