For everything I am about to say, I am using a legal definition of disabled. If having a disability is a protected class where you live: \n\nThe receptionist job was provided to you as work that you could do to prevent your employer from firing you for being disabled, which is illegal. What your coworkers are doing is creating a *hostile work environment*. To be clear, a hostile work environment is not \"my coworkers are so mean to me, they make me miserable, being at work destroys me\" (which sucks, but is a toxic work environment and may be indicative of wider hostility and harassment). A hostile work environment is where someone is harassed or discriminated against based on a protected category, in this case, disability. Again, depending on where you live, this is either prohibited or downright illegal. Your employer is *required* to ensure that your workplace is not hostile.\n\nIf disability is a protected class where you live, you need to report this to management/HR immediately. Start keeping a log of every conversation. Tell them, using these words: my coworkers are creating a hostile work environment. They are harassing me about being disabled, which, as you know, is a protected class. They seem to have a problem with me being a receptionist and not being able to do more physical work, work which I am not capable of doing. I am incredibly grateful that you have found work for me and I love my job. What will you do to make this stop.\n\nKeep in mind that, if your employer is unwilling to do anything, you should absolutely report it to your government's workers rights organisation.", "Go to HR yesterday. You are being harassed.", "NTA. Your job is supposed to make accommodations for you. Your coworkers unfortunately just see you as someone getting to do less, when you're not working less, you're just working differently. I agree with everyone else here, report to your HR or your higher ups.\n\nI will say this too. My father is on disability. Disability itself can take awhile to process and you're not even guaranteed to get it. They first have to get your records and if their medical consultants feel that they dont have enough information, they'll send you for an exam to one of their doctors. It took him months to go through the process and to get it. \n\nIf you can work with accommodations, I would stick with that first. It will not be any less complicated,  and frankly, who cares if your coworkers feel inconvenienced. They can go suck eggs.", "NTA. This isn't at all your problem to make them understand, but it sounds like your coworkers are having a hard time with you coming back from a leave of absence with an invisible disability. Like \"She was fine before, why does she need special treatment now?\" I see that happen all too often with any type of accommodation for invisible problems, even for common stuff like getting extra test time in school when you have dyslexia.

She never mentioned any illnesses, only talked about not wanting to work with the residents in memory care. She has a very negative attitude towards them. She talked to me once about how she wishes she could work in the kitchen or desk so she didn\u2019t have to \u201cdeal with the crazy\u201d memory care residents. I told my boss about that comment when it happened.\n\nThat and she still is a care giver and a primary one, which is a job you CANNOT attempt with any sort of condition.
