We decided that right after Christmas would be the perfect time, because the weather would be good and neither of us would have to worry about taking time off work. While we were planning the rest of the logistics, he mentioned to me that his best friend, James, had previously expressed interest in doing the same trip, and that it might be fun to have a few more people come. I agreed and so we reached out to a few of our friends who we thought would be interested. There ended up being 6 people that joined including a mix of his friends, my friends, and mutual friends. Everyone who went had met each other before and got along well, so we were all excited for the trip.\n\nNow one of my friends, Kate, also would have enjoyed this sort of thing. However, she used to date James, and I thought that having both of them accompany us would make it a bit awkward and uncomfortable for everyone else, so I didn't invite her or tell her about it. I figured we could do a similar girls trip later down the track instead.\n\nWe returned a couple days ago and had a really good time. Everything went smoothly and everyone enjoyed themselves. I reached out to Kate today and asked to meet up with her for a coffee, where I planned on putting forward the idea of our girl's trip. She told me that she had no interest in spending any time with me, and I made it very clear that I would rather hang out with her ex than go out with her. She found out about the trip somehow (i'm not sure who through, none of us posted anything on sm) and said that now that I've chosen her ex over her she sees no need to continue her friendship with me.\n\nWe've known each other since the start of high school, and her and James did not have a messy breakup or anything, no infedility or abuse or anything like that, just massive clash of personalities. And as long as James and my boyfriend are still friends he will always be a part of my life. I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong here or not? AITA?\n\nEdit: For everyone saying I should have given Kate the option to choose - James was invited because he had wanted to do this trip previously. It's my boyfriends trip as much as it was mine, and he has the right invite his best friend. James and Kate do not get along. James would not have wanted her on the trip.\n\nHad it been Kate who had expressed interest in the trip previously, I would have invited her and my boyfriend would not have invited James.", "created_utc": 1704381198, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yff6s/aita_for_not_inviting_my_friend_on_a_road_trip/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She SHOULD'VE heard it from YOU.", "INFO:\n\nYou said the breakup was not messy or anything like that. What makes you think the two of them wouldn't have been able to get along on the trip with each other? Have they demonstrated not being able to act civilly with each other in the past?", "YTA \n\nWell, first of all, she\u2019s right. You did make it clear where she falls on your list.\n\nIf the breakup was amicable, why couldn\u2019t you just be straightforward about it with both of them? You could have asked James first, then spoken to her about it.  OR you could have even mentioned it to her beforehand \u2018he\u2019s my bf\u2019s bff, and it\u2019s awkward so we can do something together later\u2019\n\nFor me, the worst part is hearing about it from someone else.", "YTA. You didn't even give her the choice. You said the breakup was amicable so why was she excluded? Why was she not even consulted?\n\nI'd have been really hurt myself if we were close friends. You didn't even talk to her about it beforehand. You tried to even actively hide it from her. You don't hide things from people if you don't think it'll hurt them.\n\nYou're not the asshole for not inviting your friend cause her ex was there. Many folks don't want to be around their ex. \n\nYou're not the asshole for choosing who you wanted with you. If you didn't want to invite her, you had no reason to.\n\nYou're the asshole for actually wanting her with you, not asking her, and then trying to pretend it didn't happen because you knew it would hurt her. And it did.\n\nYou could have avoided this by having an adult conversation and being like, \"Hey. BF and I are planning a road trip. BF already invited James and I wanted to know if you wanted to go or not cause of that. Id really like to go on one with you though, so if you don't feel comfortable going with James, I was thinking a girls trip, just with us?\"\n\nThat gives her the choice and prevents trip long resentment from both not being invited and purposefully kept in the dark.\n\nShe's probably not actually mad you chose James. She's mad that she wasn't even considered worth being given any choice.", "YTA...You decided on your own how people would feel and act.  As an adult, why didn't you consult the people involved. Of course she found out, and of course it looks like Kate's friendship doesn't matter to you.  How you didn't see all of this before the trip is astounding and concerning. Either that or Kate's friendship really isn't THAT important to you, in which case be honest with yourself.", ">Now one of my friends, Kate, also would have enjoyed this sort of thing. However, she used to date James, and I thought that having both of them accompany us would make it a bit awkward and uncomfortable for everyone else\n\nWhy would it make thinks awkward/uncomfortable for everyone else?\n\nIf anything it would make things uncomfortable for those two.\n\nYTA \n\nIf Kate was truly a friend you should have invited her and warned her that James would be there, so she could make her own decision; NOT excluded her entirely.\n\nI mean you didn't even discuss this with Kate ahead of time. You went on the trip with a bunch of mutual friends, explicitly left her out (HOW did you think she wouldn't find out?!) and then planned to pop back into her life, with your \"make up\" trip idea, to ease your own conscience.", "Yep, YTA.", "YTA for sure. You didn't even acknowledge her. You pretty much admitted you kept it from her and kept it hidden from her. Not even a basic heads up or ask her opinion. You made a clear choice choosing him over her.", "YTA. She might have been cool about things had you explained yourself and your position prior to her finding out about it after the fact, from someone who wasn\u2019t you, but you chose to intentionally hide things from her which, to me, makes your stance on your friendship pretty clear. It\u2019s not about the who, it\u2019s about how YOU went about the whole situation.", "INFO: \n\nDo you feel bad about what happened? \n\nHave other friends put their opinions on the situation? \n\nWhat does your bf think about the outcome of what happened with your friend?\n\nWhat have you done to try and fix this relationship? \n\nWhen I look at your edit you come off like you did nothing wrong. You buckle down on that it was your BF's trip as much as it was yours. What I think people are trying to get you to understand is that regardless of who thought of the trip or not your friendship was the one that suffered. Instead of trying to acknowledge that maybe you could have done it with some consideration for your friend's feelings in case she found out you are like but it was not just my trip and he asked first and why is everyone not understand that I did nothing wrong. \n\nIf you did nothing wrong then why did you lose a friend over it?", "YTA. \n\nNot because you went on a trip and didn't invite her, but because you actively tried to hide it from your friend.", "YTA. My lifelong best friend (literally, our moms were best friends since high school. We were born 9 months apart) did this to me when she stated dating my exes friend after high school years ago. I'd get excluded because he would there, I got \"disinvited\" to a concert we bought tickets for together before she started dating him because he decided to go. It's an absolutely horrible feeling. She was always not that great of a friend, selfish, introduced us to people as \"I'm the pretty one she's the smart one\", (thanks), and many other instances of her being a garbage friend and person.  Ps- we haven't spoken in 15 years and if she tried to contact me I'd tell her simply to get f*cked. You did her a favor showing her you have zero empathy and give zero f*cks about how your actions make her feel.", "YTA and your edit did you no favours.\n\nFirstly, why keep this a secret from Kate if she\u2019s truly a friend? Also you assumed how people would react. It seems like there was enough of you for Kate and James to not have to interact if they both went. \n\nKate is right that you absolutely chose her ex over her. You used the argument that it\u2019s your boyfriend\u2019s trip as much as yours as a defence but that isn\u2019t valid. All that reasoning does is show that you had as much right to invite Kate as he did James but chose not to. You could\u2019ve invited her, let her know that James in coming, then it\u2019s HER decision if she wants to come rather than you actively excluding her.\n\nYou were a bad friend to Kate and I\u2019d see you reason to keep a friendship going with you too if I were in her position", "YTA but only because you didn't tell her. \n\nWhen people break up, the reality is it may change things in the friend group. You and your boyfriend are friends with both, but if they don't want to interact, then that means one of them will be left out from time-to-time. If she was fine seeing him but he wasn't fine with her around, then I'd say he should be the one not included, but I see from your comments that there is more of a general feeling that neither of them want to be around the other. Fine. \n\nIn a moment like this, it makes sense why he was invited and she wasn't- your boyfriend had talked about a trip like this with James, so inviting him makes sense. BUT, you should have just told her \"hey, boyfriend talked about a roadtrip with James, a small group is going, I'd love to plan a trip with you when I get back. Not telling her is the problem. \n\nHonestly, I kind of don't even want to call you an AH because I think most of us have been here, and while I definitely think you should have told her, her response is overly dramatic.  If I was her, I would have just asked why I wasn't invited and that I was hurt my ex was invited and I wasn't.", "YTA, yeah. Not for inviting James, that was fair enough - he\u2019s your BF\u2018s friend, so it\u2019s natural he\u2019d come along occasionally. \n\nThe problem was not telling her, hiding the entire trip from her. Why wouldn\u2019t you give her the chance to make that choice on her own, and at least hear about it from you?\n\nApologize for hurting her, and try to explain your reasoning and that you came to the conclusion you were wrong. Don\u2019t minimize her hurt feelings.", "You should have at least given Kate a heads up that the trip was happening and the reasons why she couldn\u2019t come rather than doing it all behind her back. She was bound to find out and it looks so much worse to be secretive about it despite your reasoning being practical. She was bound to feel excluded.", "YTA. You could have invited her and gave her the choice to opt out if she thought things would be awkward. Y\u2019know, give them the chance to be adults about it. But as it is, going with her ex and not inviting her does make it appear that he\u2019s more important to your friend group. She missed out on a pretty fun trip *just because* she\u2019s his ex, and that\u2019s not really fair.", "YTA.  I would have told her about the trip and gave her the option of saying no. It seems in her eyes, you made the decision for her and on top of it, chose the ex over her. I don't blame her for being hurt.", "YTA\n\nIf you want to be neutral in a breakup in a friend group, you need to treat both the same. You clearly favor him over her", "YTA you chose him over her. Dont sugar coat it. Why couldnt you decide with your bf to instead prioritise your friend over his this time round? You chose to put her on a backburner. Good for you.\n\nAnd good for her. At least she knows not to bother wasting her time on you. Why were this dudes preferences in her being there even mattered, she was meant to be your friend. Bottom line is this james must be a better friend to you that kate right?", "YTA", "Way to go Kate  seeing you for what you are and removing herself from the drama you seem to like because that\u2019s what you did you caused this \n\nYta", "YTA for not having been honest and upfront, you prefered to be secretive and and you tried to hide the trip from her.\n\nYou were clearly **not** being her friend.", "YTA. AH move by not telling her beforehand. You purposely hid the trip from her and she had to find out elsewhere. The fact that you hid it makes it clear you knew it was the wrong thing to do", "Nta\n\nYou have every right to choose who goes on your trip and if you don't want to deal with two ex's that may bicker or fight while on your trip, it's totally fine to not invite one of them.", "I'm seeing a lot of people calling you an asshole here.  So I'm posting to say you're NTA.\n\nYou have two friends who don't get along.  One was invited on a group trip by your boyfriend, so you didn't invite the other one.  Not very complicated.", "YTA. If my \u201cfriend\u201d had done that, I would end that friendship too.", "YTA, I call BS on your excuse.  Did you know for a fact that all these other people that you invited really wanted to go before you asked?  Did you ask and then they made up their minds?  Which is an option you never gave Kate.  YOU decided how she would feel and made YOUR decision based on YOUR own thoughts.  Again, if you missed it YTA.", "YTA. You're 23, you've just learned how friendships are broken and don't last forever. You put your alliance in your boyfriend's court over your \"best friend\". There are some relationships that are irreparable.", "YTA.  You knew there was a chance that not being invited would upset her.  You actively concealed it from her and was shocked when she found out.\n\nIn her mind, you picked the ex over her.  I wouldn't want to be your friend either if I were her.\n\nIf you have this quandary again, talk to your friend first and see how she feels about. See what other optionsight be available.", "YTA She is your friend and you excluded her without asking her or her ex how they would feel about going on the trip. well she probably is an ex friend now as you deserve.", "Info: was it a messy break up? My thing is couldn\u2019t they just not speak to each other on the trip if you offered?", "So you planned a trip with a ton of friends, left a good friend out and hid it from her, then asked her out to coffee and you're wondering if YTA?  \n\nI'd be devastated if my friend intentionally left me out of an amazing road trip.  I remember stumbling upon a birthday lunch with ALL of my friends together at a restaurant...and I wasn't invited.  I had a guest in town and one girl didn't like her so they pushed me to the side and they went out without me.  I was so hurt and to this day I remember that feeling.  \n\nYou chose your group of friends and she's not in them anymore.  She should have been give the option and then letting them both know...EVERYONE KNOW...that if ANYONE gets nasty or fights with anyone, they'll be left at the nearest hotel to find their way back home.  Exes aren't the only people that fight.  People that close together for a week can get frustrated and bound to have snarky remarks from time to time.  YTA.  Big time", "It could go either way but I think YTA. \n\nMy wife and I have had to navigate maintaining friendships of people who have dated each other and it isn't easy. We tried to pick and choose who to invite to what and keep in mind the same things that you did when planning your trip. You DID choose James to come of this trip and you DID try to hide it from Kate and she found out. It makes sense that she is upset. It will be awkward at times when they are both together, even if the breakup wasn't messy, but it should be their choice whether they come or not. It can be very annoying to you and your BF when they're both there and can't figure out how to be around each other but that becomes a different issue. \n\nMy wife and I decided to stop picking and choosing who to invite because we shouldn't have to do that, they were our friends and can still be our friends but its up to them. We've lost touch with some people who couldn't be around their exes, but that was their decision, not ours. When you make it your decision, your risk being the asshole. \n\nNot sure if this applies to James and Kate, but don't date within your friendship group people!", "YTA. \n\nYou handled this really badly. The mature and considerate thing to do would be to talk to Kate beforehand and say \u201chey, I\u2019m planning a trip with BF. He invited James, and because you guys aren\u2019t on great terms, I think it would be best if you and I planned a trip separately.\u201d \n\nThe way you went about it comes off really underhanded. It seems like your friend group conspired to leave her out of a trip, and to add insult to injury, invited her ex. I wouldn\u2019t be friends with you all after that either.", "So James is more important because he\u2019s important to your bf. \n\nI\u2019m proud of Kate for not putting up with you. Because  you kept secrets and try to make pity trips with her just to feel better about yourself. I sincerely hope I don\u2019t have friends like you.\n\nYTA\n\nEdit: Sounds like you also warned others this was a secret trip from Kate so you made them play your ugly games so you could satisfy James.", "YTA, you did choose her ex over her. She could've been given the choice, since you stated \"We've known each other since the start of high school, and her and James did not have a messy breakup or anything, no infedility or abuse or anything like that.\" And you're somehow more upset that she found out than that you hurt your friend? You invited several people who all know each other and just assumed they would never talk about the trip ever again? Yea I wouldn't want to be friends with you either.", "YTA and I don\u2019t know how you don\u2019t know it! You even admit they didn\u2019t have a messy breakup so you jumping to excluding her rather than just asking if she\u2019d be okay to go with James being there means you did in fact choose her ex over her.", "YTA, as someone who also had friends invite my ex to a trip and not me, that stings really badly. And them not talking to me about it stung even more. But I did talk to them about it later on, I\u2019ve expressed how it made me feel and we made up. But it still baffles me that people don\u2019t get that this will hurt.", "YTA...if it was just a matter of going to her like an adult and explaining the situation then I would probably lean NTA, but the fact that you lied to her by actively trying to keep it a secret definitely makes you the AH.", "After reviewing many of the posts on this thread...how BIG does everyone think that car on the road trip was? Expandable for hordes and hordes of people? Just curious.", "I think NTA, while it\u2019s true you probably should have given her the heads up/ warning prior, I agree with your reasoning. It was more your BF\u2019s and his best friend\u2019s trip than it was yours. You were along for the ride. You have a friend group, so of course some came along. If the roles were reversed, and Kate and you had planned a trip, you wouldn\u2019t have invited James. \n\nI think she is being dramatic and causing issues on purpose. She feels left out and is hurt, but that happens sometimes. It\u2019s not always fair, but I think you and your bf have been handling things as fairly as you can. She is the one being unreasonable and over blowing this whole situation. \n\nYou didn\u2019t kill this friendship, she is choosing to. Which is fine, it\u2019s her choice.", "YTA.  You should have spoken to Kate before the trip.  You have lost a friend.", "YTA I don\u2019t care if James would t have wanted her there. He needs to realize that she will also be in your life and grow the hell up. You still should have let Kate decide. You put James\u2019 wants above Kate\u2019s.", "YTA. So what if they're exes? And, stop making excuses for your bad behavior.", "YTA. You didn't even have to invite Kate. You could have told her about the trip before it happened instead of hiding it from her. \"Hey, we're going on a trip with some friends and James is coming. I know it might make things uncomfortable for you to both be there so I was thinking we could go on a girl's trip at XYZ time since my BF invited James to this one.\" \n\nWilling to bet she's not mad that you hung out with James. She's mad that you tried to hide the trip from her.", "YTA treat people with respect or loose them from your life. That fact you hid this trip from her and she had to Find out from someone else means you knew what you were doing and how she would feel", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. \n\nThe way you went about it says to me it would\u2019ve been an entire shit show. Her reaction, to me, kinda backs up that idea. I\u2019m feeling like you didn\u2019t tell her cause you knew there\u2019d be shit from her even if she wasn\u2019t going to go. \n\nHonestly people here need to get a grip. The only people in your life it is ever NECESSARY to bring your plans too are your parents when you\u2019re underage, a committed partner or a safety contact. \n\nBFF status doesn\u2019t give you auto access to shit. \n\nPeople here: your friend made plans without telling you. Grow up and get the fuck over it.", "You should have given her the option.  She's an adult.  She can decide for herself if she can mix.\n\nUnless you just decided 6 people was the cut off.\n\nBut you should have let her decide.\n\nNot enough details really to call you an asshole.", "NTA. She is mad because you spent time with James, not because she didn\u2019t get invited. But the thing is, you will still be spending time with James in the future because he is your boyfriend\u2019s best friend. If she will not be mature enough to understand that, your friendship was already doom since the beginning, and not because of you.", "NAH - You made the decision (seemingly without input from James or Kate) that inviting them both would be uncomfortable for them/others or cause drama. In doing so you demonstrated that you prioritized the group over including Kate. And then, after deciding that you would need to pick a side - you picked James. I assume because you felt that your boyfriend's friendship with James was more of a priority than your friendship with Kate. Once again demonstrating where Kate falls on your list of priorities.  \n\nNone of that makes you an AH, but it shows how much value you place on your friendship with Kate. And I get it, not everyone can be invited to everything. There are group dynamics to consider and that gets more complicated once people partner (or break) up. But you can't just put someone last on your list of priorities and then expect them to be interested in your friendship when you finally get around to them. \n\nYou showed Kate the value you place on your friendship with her and she decided it wasn't worth her time.", "YTA.\n\nAlthough I\u2019d say your mess up wasn\u2019t not inviting her, that was probably the right choice, but by not telling her yourself what was going on. However she found out about it, it must have felt like you hid it from her because you\u2019d rather hang out with her ex than her and were keeping it a secret. It\u2019s one thing to know your friend is hanging with your ex because he\u2019s still a friend, another to have to hear from it from someone else and feel entirely out of the loop.\n\nThis probably would have gone over a lot better had you been open about the trip, explain why James was invited and then suggest a girls trip.", "YTA. You literally cut her out and show her that she isn't worth that much to you. You should have given her a choice. But you just assume things and then decide to cut her out. Of course, she should end her relationship with a person like you.", "Yta. Good on her for having enough self respect to tell you to pound sand. You were a crappy friend.", "YTA for the bad communication. Could have discussed it with him, her,- see if both could come. Could have at least told her about the trip and how James asked if he could come, and that you want to plan a girls trip. Letting her find out from someone else is shady- you obviously hoped she\u2019d never know.", "YTA and I wouldn\u2019t even consider you a friend after this. Friends don\u2019t do this shit", "NAH\n\nNot every friend gets invited to every single event, especially one with limited space. Sometimes, you don't get invited. Does it suck? Sure. But it's not the end of the world, or the end of the friendship.", "YTA\n\nThe issue isn't that you took a trip with Kate's ex. The real issue is that you didn't talk to her like an actual adult. All you had to do was explain the situation. \n\nSeriously, what was the plan here? You didn't tell Kate about the trip and you assumed you could just take a separate one with her later without her ever knowing about the first one. Were you going to pretend all the sights and locations were a new experience for you just to keep the secret going?", "YTA. To piggyback on other comments, you failed to give her the option of choosing to go on the trip or not, and actively hid the group trip from Kate ( IDK how she found out no body posted on SM).\n Something else to think about, you said James is your Boyfriend's friend. How long have they been friends? You said you've been friends with Kate since Highschool. Was this going to turn into every time James is included in a group activity, Kate would be excluded from that activity?  I'll wager Kate already figured that out for herself and acted accordingly.", "YTA. You should said something to her, not let her know for whoever tell her. That's the more painful thing to her, let her thinks you chose sides. You could just said your BF is the one that put the trip together and invite James first and you didn't want thing to be awkward or whatever. If you two are friends for that long, we would think that communication is strong and clear enough that you can explain the logistics to her. And if the trip put the James and BF or you and Jane relationship in danger, you could just not bring either of them. Your actions let her know what is important to you, and she fall down in that list.", "YTA. I could NEVER EVER go chill with a friends ex just because we got along and were friendly while they were together. That\u2019s a whole cut off from the moment the relationship ends.", "You are a shitty friend. \n\nI\u2019m glad she had the courage and resolve to end this \u201cfriendship\u201d now before investing more into it. \n\nDon\u2019t take the word shitty above personally. It\u2019s just an honest word to use. \n\nBe better. For yourself, your friends you still have, and your kids in the future. Don\u2019t pass this diseased mindset to anyone else.", "I stopped reading when you said you hadn't told her. That makes you YTA here.\n\nYou should've discussed it with her to see if she wanted to join knowing that information. You made a decision for her and that's where you went wrong.", "Your a crappy friend and I\u2019m happy she dumped you. You knowingly lied and excluded her instead of being a decent human and explaining it to her. Your not her friend.", "NAH and why:  You were really in a no win situation.  What if you had offered the trip to your friend, knowing that it would make her ex-partner uncomfortable and she accepted just because of that?  Then the ex-partner would pull out, and who knows how many others would have the well poisoned and also pull out.  What if she said no, and then also did some well poisoning of her own?  This is grown up level stuff that she should understand by now -- not everyone gets to go on every excursion, especially involving ex-lovers.  People break up and hate each other. Personalities clash. Folks hold grudges. Friends have to learn to walk a fine line, and sometimes we step on the wrong side of it. But we do out best.  Your friend would have been angry no matter what, so just let it lay for now and keep the channels open.  If she is actually a good friend, she'll get it eventually.", "YTA you still should have extended the invite. While I think her reaction was extreme because she knows that's your bf friend still you could have offered.", "NTA, your friend is insecure and immature. You can go on trips with whomever you want, and you have no requirement to take her on every trip you go on.", "NTA I think her response shows you what the trip would have been like if she had gone...", "NTA. It's you and your boyfriend's trip. You guys can invite who you want. If it was your trip you planned with your friend group and you excluded her in place of her ex then that's one thing, and you would be the AH.

She\u2019s being petty because your actions hurt her but she may get over it in time.", "NTA.\n\nThis sounds like a messy situation, even if their breakup wasn't.  Your boyfriend is best friends with her ex.  That means you are going to definitely still interact with him.  She has to be able to understand that.   \n\nYou wanted to avoid drama, and James expressed interest in going already.  \n\nShe wants you to choose her, but this isn't a situation where you can just cut this dude out of your life due to his relationship with your BF. \n\nUnfortunately, you may just have to let her be in her feelings on this.", "Tell her and let her decide.

James and Kate need to grow up and be able to handle such situations within a blended circle of friends without placing a burden of avoidance on everyone else.  You and your boyfriend should have been clear about this situation in the invitation process and let them both know you wanted to invite the other and allow them to make the decision.  I think the whole \"dibs\" way of managing this rather immature.  You also shouldn't have kept it hidden from Kate.", "ESH - I don't know why there aren't more of these judgements. \n\nOP it was a dick move to intentionally hide the trip, however, your entitlement not to invite everyone. Trips like that you want a compatible group and sometimes that means people get left out. I have friends who don't get invited to the same event because they would clash and I dont care of the drama. Also not being invited to everything a friend does is just apart of adult friendships. Further, unless you have really small friend circles or you invited everyone only 6 could attend, it doesn't sound like just Kate got left out and intentionally excluded. \n\nFurther, Unless you have a history of 'picking' James over Kate and this is just example 12 Kate has of this and you have never picked her, then Kate is being unreasonable to end a friendship without a discussion. If she really valued the friendship she would at least have a discussion about the situation before cutting all ties. Like, she is justified in being hurt and feeling excluded but also again, welcome to adult friendships?", "NTA. The person who plans the trip geta to decide who goes.. It's really that simple..\n\nAlso considering the hissy fit your friend threw you obviously made the right choice.", "NTA \n\nThis reeks of him leaving her with how petty she is trying to be.

But i think you should have told her about the trip. It sounds like this was a trip partially planned by her friends ex. He initially suggested it.\n\nWould Kate want him to come on a trip she planned?\n\nThere are consequences to dating people in your friend group.

People say you should\u2019ve asked her, and honestly I don\u2019t blame you for not asking cuz I wouldn\u2019t wanna risk ruining the whole trip for everyone (which is likely if Kate joins and bickers w James) just so one person can feel included. She has the right to feel hurt though, cuz not being included sucks, and from her POV you chose James over her. I was in similar situations before, where some of my friends hung out with my ex without telling me. I literally didn\u2019t mind it one bit, cuz they know it\u2019s awkward for us, and they\u2019ve hung out with me without my ex too (no messy breakup, just awkward).

That didn\u2019t happen, so the trip went well.

James had explicitly wanted to do this trip and as the best friend of OP\u2019s boyfriend had anyway called dibs on this. \n\nThis is supposed to be a fun trip for everyone involved, and not an episode of reality TV. \n\nOP is right. Only thing that she could've done is talk to her Kate about it and explain her position..", "NTA. Cut Kate loose. If she can't understand that you can be friends with both her and her ex,  but not necessarily on the same trip,  you don't need her.

We decided that right after Christmas would be the perfect time, because the weather would be good and neither of us would have to worry about taking time off work. While we were planning the rest of the logistics, he mentioned to me that his best friend, James, had previously expressed interest in doing the same trip, and that it might be fun to have a few more people come. I agreed and so we reached out to a few of our friends who we thought would be interested. There ended up being 6 people that joined including a mix of his friends, my friends, and mutual friends. Everyone who went had met each other before and got along well, so we were all excited for the trip. \n\nNow one of my friends, Kate, also would have enjoyed this sort of thing. However, she used to date James, and I thought that having both of them accompany us would make it a bit awkward and uncomfortable for everyone else, so I didn't invite her or tell her about it. I figured we could do a similar girls trip later down the track instead. \n\nWe returned a couple days ago and had a really good time. Everything went smoothly and everyone enjoyed themselves. I reached out to Kate today and asked to meet up with her for a coffee, where I planned on putting forward the idea of our girl's trip. She told me that she had no interest in spending any time with me, and I made it very clear that I would rather hang out with her ex than go out with her. She found out about the trip somehow (i'm not sure who through, none of us posted anything on sm) and said that now that I've chosen her ex over her she sees no need to continue her friendship with me. \n\nWe've known each other since the start of high school, and her and James did not have a messy breakup or anything, no infedility or abuse or anything like that. And as long as James and my boyfriend are still friends he will always be a part of my life. I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong here or not? AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Does everyone have to be included in everything simply out of courtesy? In essence does everyone from both social circles have to be invited to everything so is not to exclude someone? Where is the reasonable cutoff?", "YTA.\n\nStop trying to make excuses. YTA.\n\nYou're obviously in the wrong. YTA.\n\nI hope the rest of your women friends register that you think James is more important than them, as you'll be dumping them should James (or some other friend of your bf) need to be accommodated.", "YTA (in a soft way) due to how you handled it. I do think this could be resolvable. Take accountability and say you handled it wrong and you should have told her about the trip and that James was going and that you didn\u2019t want anyone on the trip to feel awkward or there even be a possibility there could be any drama or upset. As the organizers of the trip, you felt responsible for everyone attending\u2019s comfort. Your bf invited James because it was something they had discussed previously and not because he\u2019s the preferred party in the split when it comes to you. Advise her that your friendship is very important and you never meant to hurt her, you just chose the wrong way to handle it with her and James is not more important than her but there may be times when there will be plans that one of the other of them will be invited to unless James and her sit down and hash out how it would work going forwards. It may be too late but it\u2019s always worth a try. Humility may be the best option here.", "NAH here. You didn\u2019t invite her because it would make you uncomfortable, and didn\u2019t tell her about it (despite a reasonable expectation of her finding out third hand, considering the history and friend group overlap), all of which was your prerogative. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want t be friends anymore because your decision makes her uncomfortable, which is her prerogative. \n\nYou\u2019ve both made your choices and disagree with each other.

You were taking 2 cars so they would travel separately, put them in separate hotel rooms. They wouldn't have been together constantly. You also have a conversation with each of that this is a fun trip for everyone so if they have nothing nice to say they keep it to themselves, there is no expectaion for them to ckmmunicate, and they are expected to behave. if they cant they can leave the trip and make their own way home.\n\nYou chose your bfs friend over your own.", "YTA- put yourself in her shoes, how would YOU feel if she did that to you? You could\u2019ve easily said \u201chey, we\u2019re going on this road trip, and my fianc\u00e9 really wanted to bring James (because it\u2019s his best friend). I\u2019d love for you to come too, but I didn\u2019t know if James coming would be an issue for you. If you don\u2019t want to come, that\u2019s totally fine, because I wanna do an \u201call girls\u201d roadtrip in the near future.", "YTA\n\nEven more so with the edit. You not wanting Kate on this trip would have been ok without this whole bs story you told us. Your trip, your choice. But the YTA is because of the reason you are using, not the act of not inviting her.\n\nJames had the chance to tell you he wanted to come because he knew about the trip, because your boyfriend told him. Kate never had that option because no one told her about it. So how could she ever had the chance to express an interest if you never told her that you were going on this trip? Is she supposed to read your mind ? It makes 0 sense.\n\nIt was for her to decide if she was comfortable or not to come along. Same thing for James. They should have had the same option. But you clearly chose James over her in this situation.\n\nThere is nothing more frustrating than \"friends\" making decisions on your behalf and not consulting you on those decisions.", "INFO. Would you consider Kate one of your closest friends? And were you planning on mentioning the trip to her during your meet up? \n\nIf the answer to the first question is yes, Y T A. You don\u2019t do that to close friends without any heads up. If the answer to the second question is no, Y T A. It\u2019s pretty naive to think that she would never find out about a six person trip that had at least some of her friends on it, and not only are you not inviting her, you are straight up lying by omission. What were you going to say when she asked how your Christmas break was? Nothing? I have sympathy for your predicament, I\u2019ve had to deal with awkward social situations too, but hiding things from people and sneaking around is NEVER the answer. \n\nIf you guys weren\u2019t very close, and you were going to tell her at that lunch (and the only reason you hadn\u2019t was because you hadn\u2019t seen her in a while), in that case, N T A. You didn\u2019t post it on social media, so you obvs weren\u2019t planning on her finding out there, and her ex came as her bfs guest, not yours. \n\nUnfortunately, my judgment (and everyone else\u2019s) don\u2019t really matter because you\u2019ve lost a friend regardless. I\u2019d be surprised if you could change that at this point. Next time, make sure to prioritize communication above all else, and don\u2019t try to be sneaky with people you care about. She very well might have understood if you\u2019d talked to her before the trip, and you would have done effectively the same actions but still have her as a friend. I\u2019ve been tempted to do the same kind of thing you did to avoid awkwardness, but I haven\u2019t because I\u2019ve always felt that if I do, I\u2019ve destroyed the friendship - maybe not right now, maybe at some future date, but destroyed regardless", "Sorry the kids don't understand the problem - they've all been raised that they are automatically included in everything no matter what and being left out is a major social sin on the part of the person not inviting them.

If Kate is going to take not being invited to one event - no matter what it is - as an indication that you don't care about her, then Kate has a bigger problem, and it is not yours to fix.

A middle school class trip from which OP excluded Kate?", "You could have at least explained to her ahead of time why she wasn't invited so that you guys won't look like some high school clique going out of its way to exclude her.", "ANDTA, you could have asked her,telling her her ex was coming,if they didnt end in a bad way", "YTA. You\u2019re young, these king of mess ups are going to happen (especially when romance is involved).\n\nHowever you shouldn\u2019t treat your friends like this in the future. Honesty and transparency are crucial to maintaining any type of friendship/relationship. \n\nKate has the right to walk away, and you\u2019re at fault, but hopefully you can learn from this for your other friendships. \n\nAlso, please be wary of being more mindful of a boyfriend\u2019s feelings over the feelings of your childhood friend. That almost never ends well. Unless you found THE ONE, long time friends tend to last longer than boyfriends. \n\nBasically, this all could have been avoided if you were upfront with her to begin with.", "I can't believe all the Y T A responses...  It is very clear that you were correct in your intuition that having both of them along would be a huge mistake.  Given that - James was the first person the two of you agreed to invite.  What were you supposed to do - kick him out in order to invite her when he's the reason the trip was opened up to more than the two of you? NTA.", "YTA, you were a crap friend. You tried to be sneaky and lie and hide it and you got caught.\n\nYou did choose the ex over her or should I say allowed the boyfriend to choose the ex over her and you didn't say anything. You thought as long as she didn't find out you were good to go.\n\nI wouldn't want to be friends with you either.", "YTA. You should have just asked her, she's a big girl, she can decide if she wanted to go or not. If she really thought she wasn't going to get along with her ex enough to make the trip uncomfortable for everyone then she would have decided not to come. You didn't have to play mediator but you did play favorites.", "It wasn't messy in the sense that there wasn't any sort of abuse or cheating that lead to them breaking up, but it wasn't entirely amicable either. From what I understand, it was a case of two different personalities clashing, and two people with very different views of life so towards the end they was a lot of arguments and dislike of the other person. \n\nIt was mutual in that both realised that they needed to end things, but they both left the relationship with a lot of dislike towards the other person.", "Agreed. The asshole move wasn't her not being included. You can choose who you want to include.\n\nThe asshole move was trying to hide it from her and then getting caught in a lie.\n\nIt sucks when you're not even worth a difficult conversation.", "It looks like the breakup may have only been amicable on one side, from the info at the end (potentially an edit posted after your comment?). I'm in a similar situation with my ex - he is more than willing to hang out in a group where I'm around, I would prefer to be on the other side of the room, city, state, country, galaxy, universe...I want nothing to do with him. He was an AH to me (hence why I broke up with him) and the fact that he's OK with me really just makes me feel like I at least did a decent job not returning the favor. \n\nI'm going with ESH, because OP should have been up front with Kate. But if James isn't OK hanging with Kate, Kate needs to respect that she may not be invited on some outings where James was one of the primary planners. It's one of those things you risk when you date in the friend group - I've had to back out of events after finding out my ex would be in attendance, and my ex's brother obviously doesn't have to invite me to things over his brother (like how OP's BF doesn't need to invite his best friend's ex).", "Agreed. OP should have said something to Kate BEFORE the trip.", "We invited James first since he had previously mentioned wanting to do the same trip, and it was my boyfriends trip as much as it was mine.

Surely someone who was invited told Kate, the person must have being surprise that she didn' t invite Kate, since they are \"friends\" .... I would also want to have no contact with her, imagine, she invited friends in common but thought no one was going to tell Kate ...", "I'm curious why everyone seems to think that Kate should have been given the option, when there must be many other friends who were also not invited?

Anyone who can't be civil is kicked out of hanging with the group for the rest of the trip (you probably can't kick them out of their rooms).\n\nOn normal hangouts, you'll probably be alternating between them - but not on life events or a big trip like this when the whole group is going.", "Ok but like, James wouldnt have wanted her there and he was invited first", "True you do have the right but if the one you excluded was supposed your close friend \u201csince the start of high school\u201d you also have the right to lose that person, goes both ways", "Agreed. It doesn't seem like it was everyone in the friend group except Kate, it was just a random group of 6 friends. I'm sure they had plenty of other friends they also didn't invite.

You hid it from her. \n\nInstead of acting like an adult, \u201cKate, we\u2019re going to be taking this trip, I would love to invite you, but bf already invited James and since you two don\u2019t get along, I\u2019d like to do a separate trip with you and our friends at another time.\u201d\n\nYou said NOTHING. That right there is more hurtful than the actual not inviting. Like you had to act like a sneaky teenager. I\u2019d be more mad at that than the not being invited. It absolutely should\u2019ve been a conversation prior to the trip vs a cowardly approach. \n\nYou owe her an apology for that. But N T A for not inviting her as you can invite who you choose.", "Yeah I reread, and it still sounds like this trip was still mainly between the BF and his best friend. Best friend and Boyfriend had talked about doing this, so then when OP and the BF decided on the trip they immediately invited the best friend. I don\u2019t really see how a small technicality changes things.", "Agreed", "No, the plan started with OP and her boyfriend. Then BF asked OP about inviting James and others. \n\nOnce the BF brought up the idea of inviting others (which according to OP he did prior to inviting James), OP could have had a discussion with her BF about whether they could/should invite both James and Kate. OP either didn't think about Kate in that moment or chose not to take her into consideration. Again, not saying OP is an AH. Just that including Kate wasn't a priority for her.", "Masochists??? I have, and it sucks. \nBut where does it end? Kate can't be a bridesmaid and doesn't get invited or even told about the wedding because James is a groomsman since the BF asked James first. Picture it like this, your friend group includes a couple where one of them  is friends with your ex and the other is your friend. The couple plans a group outing, invites your ex, and your friend doesn't bother telling you about the outing at all. You find out about the outing via a third party. Your friend comes back from the outing and contacts you. How do you feel about the situation? Are you okay with your friend's behavior? But it's okay because your friend, without telling you was going to do an outing with you in the future. It's not the broken up couple situation that makes OP the AH, it's the OP keeping her friend (whom she has been friends with for years 5-10 years, remember since high school) in the dark about the entire thing. But thinking she's good because she was going to plan a trip with Kate in the future, but again didn't tell Kate about. The OP would've been NTA if she told Kate up front about the trip, the fact James would be going on trip, but that she wanted to do a trip with just Kate later on.", "Friend is mad because OP hung out with her ex and thinks OP ought to choose between them?", "I think we all know a set of exes who, if we can avoid it, we wouldn't' invite both of them.  \n\nI had a situation like that not long ago.   In a lot of ways it split our friend group, because when event would happen, people would basically have to choose which person to invite.", "As far as I know they haven't interacted at all. There's not much overlap between my friend group and my boyfriend's friend group so it's not like there's been any reason for James and Kate to interact with each other if it has nothing to do with my boyfriend and I.", "Fair, but the bigger point, again, wasn't that as much as it was that she wasn't even informed of this, learned of it second hand, and OP had no intention of telling her.\n\nHell, she could have even worded it that way to remove a lot of blame from herself. \"Hey, my BF invited James, and he doesn't feel comfortable with us being in close confined spaces given the fights that were going on. I love you, but this really isn't a hill that I want to die on, but I really want to go on a trip like this with you. Would you like to go on a road trip, just the two of us, once this is done? Or can you talk to my BF and make it clear that you two will be cool?\"", "OP should have been upfront with her. That's the only reason ESH for me, because she tried to hide it and her (ex) friend had to find out from someone else. \nHowever OP describes her as a friend. \nFriends ex is described as OPs boyfriend's best friend. Obviously he will come first.\n(Sorry, I forgot everyone's names, and since I'm on mobile I can't go back and check without deleting everything).", "They each invited a couple friends. Unless they only have 7 friends total, Kate is not the only one left out. Not everyone gets invited to everything, that's just life.", "We don't know if every other member of the friend group was invited, do we?", "So if I have 10 friends and I go on a trip with some of them, I am required to tell them all and invite them all regardless of what kind of trip I go on?", "I don't think it was entitlement...\n\nAnyone would be hurt if their friends group didn't include them in something... that's not entitlement at all.", "here we go again with just throwing out buzz words to get upvotes", "That's what you got out of this situation? Sigh.", "Did OP comment elsewhere that I'm missing? She calls Kate \"one of [her] friends\", I don't see that they are BFFs or anything. I also don't see where she actively hid it from her, other than just not telling her. When I invite 6 of my friends to something I don't go around notifying everyone else that they weren't invited, nor vice versa. \n\nI do agree that she should have communicated better and told her ahead of time if she suspected Kate would feel left out.", "Exactly this your Nta bc you can have whoever you want but Yta for hiding it don\u2019t be surprised if she wants nothing to do with you", "Have you apologized to her atleast for doing this? How you went about it is really shitty and your edit doesnt take any accountability about hurting her?\n\nDo you actually care or do you just want to be told you were right?", "You still could have asked by saying by mentioning that James was already going. That way  you would have been giving her a choice instead of assuming there would be a problem.", "Well congrats, you won\u2019t have to worry about any potential overlap at all anymore since you\u2019ve made the choice of opting for her ex.", "You\u2019ve clearly chosen your boyfriends friends over yours and you need to stop acting like she\u2019s your friend", "Exactly, its the not wanting to have a difficult conversation with her. \nI would have felt awful to be excluded and not being told about it.", "If neither OP nor her boyfriend told Kate about the trip, and no one posted anything, then it\u2019s likely one of the other attendees told Kate because they are also friends with Kate. So we need more info from OP, because if OP had a friend group of like 3-4 people and invited the other friends, then yeah. It\u2019s fair game for Kate to be upset.", "No, but if you have a group of 5 friends and invite 4 of them, then you should tell the 5th. It really all depends on the details.\n\nAnd if you have a group of 10 friends and go on a trip with 3 of them, purposefully hiding the trip in casual conversation, etc. from the rest of your friends is a shit move and also very suspect behavior.", "I'm curious about the friend groups that people posting in this thread have. I have multiple large friend groups, and other than house parties or park hangs, it's impossible to invite everyone. If it were everyone from one friend group except for her that would be one thing, but it sounds like 6 random friends from various friend groups who happen to get along.\n\nEspecially with something like a road trip, sometimes you just can't invite everyone. I don't think that makes you an AH if you don't personally inform everyone else that they weren't invited and why.", "What buzz word?", "Yes, because the friend is being an entitled brat. It's an easy conclusion to come to", "Granted we don't really do road trips but we've done ny trips or something like that.   Yes every one in the group gets invited (even exs that we never were able to get rid of after breakups).  It's up to people themselves to decide to go or not.   \n\nPersonally, I don't think OP is an AH for not inviting... more for not communicating with the friend so that she ended up hurt over the whole thing.   She didn't handle the situation well.  It would have been different if OP didn't invite the whole rest of the friend group.  If it was just OP, BF, and James and she didn't invite Kate then she wouldn't have needed to tell Kate about it.   When she invited the rest of the group and tried to hide it (clear sign she knew she was doing something her friend would be hurt by), it changed things.", "It doesn't sound like the rest of the people were the rest of the same friend group Kate was a part of, OP said it was a mix of her and her bf's friends (but it's not clear so I suppose INFO).\n\nYou invite everyone to everything even if it's an activity that would be much better in a smaller group? I do that when we're going out to a bar or something, but I wouldnt want to invite like 50 people to a cottage weekend where there are only 4 beds... That sounds very inclusive but a logistical nightmare lol. \n\nBut yes I agree OP could have handled the communication better, especially if she suspected Kate would feel left out when she found out.", "If we were planning a trip it would be more like...everyone is invited and then the people going find/plan accommodations.  So like this summer, probably 20-25 people were invited to NY trip for my friends birthday.  6 of us went...3 couples.  We booked our own hotel rooms and drove separately (as the birthday girl didn't know we were going and the other couple was flying from FL).  If it wasn't NY and we were doing Air B&B over hotel, the people going would all chip in.  Usually everyone is invited but not everyone goes so the likeliness of 50 people at the cottage weekend is pretty much zero.\n\nI guess we plan more outings than trips though so maybe that's why its normal to invite everyone?\n\nAs for OP, in this case, I guess I assumed the rest of the people that went were in the friend group through the comments.  If they weren't then I don't think its as big of a deal she didn't say anything."]}
