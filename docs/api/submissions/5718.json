Yesterday for Christmas, my brother (m29) came over for lunch with his wife (f29) and their kids.\n\nMy brother has two kids, but this story only involves the youngest. We'll call him Sam (m5).\n\nSam is a permanently hyperactive kid, he can't sit still for anything and is really destructive and defiant. He's really poorly behaved and to be honest I think he's spoiled and acts the way he does because my brother and his wife give little to no consequences. He's currently on a waiting list to be assessed for ADHD.\n\nThere were some other family members with young children who were also coming round for lunch. Me and my parents were preparing the food together.\n\nWe had a separate table for the kids in the living room so they could watch TV and not be bored by the grown ups talking. I went to the kids table and started dishing up the food. A couple of my cousins volunteered to watch the kids in the living room so the parents could have a peaceful lunch but they were helping out with something else when this happened.\n\nSam started running around sticking his hands in the other kids' food which riled them up and they were yelling at him to stop and saying that he has dirty hands. I also told Sam to stop and told him to go back to his chair. \n\nSam ignored me and kept touching the other kids' food. He then took bites of a 3 year old child's food which made them cry and they started having a full-on meltdown on the floor while the other kids were yelling at him. As you can imagine it was chaos, and I was all out of patience. \n\nI lost my temper and started yelling at Sam and told him he's upsetting everyone and that he's being selfish. Sam went silent for a few seconds then started crying. \n\nMy brother's wife came in and asked what was going on. Sam immediately started yelling and said that I made him cry and that I yelled at him. \n\nShe asked if this was true and I tried to explain to her what happened but she kept talking over me and interrupting and told me that I am not to yell at her kid, and that I'm a horrible b@#ch. She told me when I have my own kids someday I can yell at them instead. I couldn't even get half-way through explaining what happened but she wasn't interested in listening.\n\nShe left and I comforted the 3 year old and got her a new plate of food and I ate her old one.\n\nShe then went and told my brother that I yelled at Sam and made him cry and now my brother is also royally pissed off with me. I explained to my brother my side of the story and he said I shouldn't have yelled at a kid plain and simple.\n\nSam is getting no consequences for his behaviour yesterday btw.\n\nI get that ideally I should've kept my composure and not yelled, but everyone loses their temper sometimes.\n\nEdit: so for ppl asking why I didn't leave the room and grab Sam's parents, to my knowledge they were outside helping my other siblings put up some Christmas lights that fell off the exterior of the house, but my SIL came inside to go to the bathroom and heard the screaming. \n\nI didn't want to leave the kids for even a few minutes in case they escalated as they were all extremely riled up. The youngest is 1.5 years old so yeah.", "created_utc": 1672078227, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvsy2l/aita_for_yelling_at_my_nephew_when_he_was/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yelling isn\u2019t necessarily the best option, but he does need to know that he can\u2019t do whatever he pleases. What I find really hypocritical is that Sam\u2019s mum was talking over you and calling you a horrible bitch. If she doesn\u2019t want people to parent her child, she needs to do it herself and communicate with people clearly. If parents can\u2019t communicate calmly, their kids are never going to learn this skill, which is a huge shame IMO. I\u2019m a teacher and I feel like a spend a lot of my time teaching kids how to resolve small conflicts.", "Yelling wasn't the best response. The best response would have been the parents doing extremely basic parenting.\n\nThe second best response would have been you touching him when talking to him, announcing specific but light consequences if the behavior doesn't stop, then follow through with the consequences as necessary, and have the parents fully support those consequences.\n\nBoth of these weren't an option, so yelling, while suboptimal, will work. And it's 1000 times better than ignoring the behavior, which the parents did.\n\nNTA.\n\nYou did screw up in the defense of your actions, that's where you have to improve. The anti-parent framed it as your fault and it worked. \n\nNext time, a useful consequence for bad behavior might be that he isn't allowed in any room without his parents present in that room if he can't behave. If the parents don't play along, a useful consequence for them is that they are no longer allowed in any room without their parents present either. (If that means throwing them out, so be it)\n\n\n----\n\nWith ADHS the severity of the consequence is almost irrelevant, so you can go extremely light on them (stickers, compliments). What's extremely important is announcing them first, following through every time, and have positive consequences as well. That might be difficult with these parents, which is why I recommended the consequence of making them parent if he doesn't behave.", "NTA.

Next time, go get your parents or someone else to intervene (such as the 3 yo\u2019s mother). \n\nYou never, ever want to yell at a child, but they (the parents) set this situation up themselves.

The parents don\u2019t even have a diagnosis but they do have zero boundaries, consequences, and are fine to just be off doing whatever while all the others kids have their food poked, manhandled, and Christmas ruined.  \n\nIs yelling great?

Is this a situation where the parents were unwilling to intervene or just ignorant that was a situation?", "NTA\n\n5 is young and I have to deal with that kind of behavior at work frequently. Sometimes, a loud sound is the easiest way to get a kids attention. Another option is to remove them from the situation until they're ready to calm their body down.

Learn to discipline/handle kids without yelling. Yelling just adds a bunch of negative energy and gets people, including children, all riled up\u2014it never helps.

You didn't *teach him* discipline if that's what you think you were achieving here. You made an angry loud noise and shut down a child on Christmas.", "YTA. It sounds like his parents are trying to get a handle on this in the best way they can by getting him evaluated and getting help from professionals. You don't teach a neurodivergent 5 year old how to act better overnight and punishing their neurodivergence doesn't help anything. Screaming and yelling at a 5 year old and calling him selfish helps absolutely nothing here. You taught them nothing, you didn't difuse the situation, you just made it worse. Normal 5 year olds act out and push boundaries, but add in ADHD, and it's that much harder for them to understand and control their behavior. He's barely out of toddlerhood.", "YTA\n\nIn this situation what you should do is go and get the parents of the child so they can deal with them.\n\nWhat you should never do is yell at a 5 year old kid that isn\u2019t yours (especially if that child potentially has a neurological disability that is the cause of their behaviour)", "YTA, if you don\u2019t have the patience to engage with a hyperactive child you shouldn\u2019t volunteer to be try and be the authority in the situation, kids can be a handful but they\u2019re young minds create core memories during their early years very easily, if a room of chaotic children pushes you to the edge of losing your composure you should just stay out of that room", "I\u2019m going to say YTA because I don\u2019t think anyone besides the parents should discipline their children.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even if the yelling was aimed at one child, the other children were effected. There is psychological analysis on young children being yelled at being less effective because their brains essentially turn off as a response.\n\nSo while they may have stopped the instigating frustration, they didn't exactly help the situation. Building up to that point is part of why the toddler was freaking out just as much as the child's behavior, but the adult is expected to be an adult.\n\nYelling at young children should be for situations where the child is legit in danger (running towards a street, for example), not because an adult decided another adult wasn't doing enough without any personal experience and clearly any better knowledge on the subject. That's why they are an asshole.", "How is it patronizing? It's realistic.

I'm not saying that ND 5 year olds are incapable of good behavior- I'm saying it takes time to teach them, maybe more time than a neurotypical 5 year old, to control their impulses.

Services that will provide them education and resources on how to best handle this. That's the most responsible thing that they can do at this point. You can't punish away neurodivergence. It doesn't sound like they're just letting him act out. It sounds like they don't yet have the tools to know how to best handle this. It isn't their fault our mental health care system is shit and they have to be on a waiting list for basic care for their young child. Parenting a child, especially a ND child is so fucking hard. It's a learning process. They're still learning and so is this 5 year old child.", "Parents can be very protective over their children and why I suggest in these situations if you have no control and feel like yelling at the child, better to just leave and get the parent, I agree the child\u2019s behavior shouldn\u2019t be excused but once an adult yelled at the child it was excused because the child cried and became the victim", "She can stop him by grabbing the parents. It sounds like the parents were also around in the house so it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal to grab them and put the ball in their court. The parents do suck but OP does as well for disciplining a kid that it not theirs.", "or he might not have ADHD at all and just has never been disciplined and therefore thinks it\u2019s ok to do whatever he wants because his parents don\u2019t parent.", "You don't need to be a 5 star chef to say that a meal is undercooked and could give you food poisoning, in the same way you don't need to be a child psychologist to say someone is letting their kid get away with things with no consequences.", "Just to be clear, the behavior of the child is extremely unusual, even for a child with ADHS. There is little chance that normal parents are unawre their children behave like that and aren't constantly supervising a child with such tendencies. ADHS combined with consequence free parenting can cause the described behavior.\n\nOP knows supervision and consequences are necessary. It seems the parents do not.\n\nWhat OP didn't know at the time was how to create effective alternative consequences. I would hope OP now reads a book about ADHS to be better equipped next time (e.g. Russell Barkley, Taking charge of ADHS)\n\nOf course all this is conjecture made with assumptions based on a retelling purely from OPs view point. Maybe there are already consequences in place OP decided to omit, and maybe the parents weren't supervising due to an emergency .", "If your kid can't stop themselves from being a jerk to other kids, don't be upset if other people stop them from doing that if you leave them in charge.\n\nI don't think you'd have the same attitude if another child was mean to yours and the parents refused to give consequences because they're ND.\n\nBeing ND is not an excuse for shitty behaviour and they will never learn if they don't have consequences for it.\n\nI agree yelling wasn't the best response but the sentiment of \"they're ND so it's just what they do!\" towards bullying other kids is a huge disservice to everyone involved. I myself am ND and was in special education and I've seen many parents with this attitude raise absolute monsters.", "Gotta abandon the other kids while fetching the parents, stopping him first was the responsible thing to do, that or physically forcing him to go with her to the parents.", "If you think someone is an awful cook, and the first time you cook for them, you give them salmonella - then you probably shouldn't have been thinking they were an awful cook.", "But OP didn't \"stop\" anything. They added to the chaos and fueled the fire. They did absolutely nothing to help the situation by yelling at and name calling a 5 year old child. Why is a 5 year old expected to control themselves when this 20 year old adult can't? \nAnd how exactly do we know the parent didn't do anything to curb the behavior? What exactly is she supposed to do? Scream and yell at the kid like OP? I personally would remove my ND child from the situation and talk to them without the other people or the chaos around so that they can better focus. But OP is assuming that because she didn't ream the kid out in front of everyone nothing was done.", "The parents were in this situation were not given the opportunity to give consequences for their child's behavior. Disciplining the child after they've already been yelled at would be inappropriate, as approaching a child you should be there to react to the situation.\n\nTry to take OP's uneducated analysis of their parenting with a grain of salt, will ya?", "There were other cousins that volunteered to watch the kids. Even though they were helping out with something else it would be easy to be like \u201chey cousin watch them while I go grab the parents\u201d. I come from a big family and it\u2019s not hard to have someone else watch a kid while you go grab a responsible adult to help.\n\nETA: I\u2019m kind of concerned that your only options of disciplining a kid are either yelling at them or becoming physical.", "The irony that you're assuming the parents are actually doing anything. And where did OP name call the nephew? Telling someone they're acting selfish is not name calling lol. SIL did name call OP though.", "So you just keep talking while he ignores you? Sounds real effective! I'm not talking about beating him up, just controlling him.", "\"He's on the waiting list to be evaluated for ADHD.\" Which means the parents have reached out for services and are awaiting said services. Telling a 5 year old they're selfish is name calling and immature as all hell. They're 5. What the fuck does that accomplish? Jack shit. Yelling at a kid and insulting them isn't discipline but there are alarming amount of people on this thread who think it is. Yikes.", "No you can try to tell them to stop and if that doesn\u2019t work go grab a parent that can deal with it. Yelling does not need to be the go to option when dealing with children. I\u2019ve dealt with situations just like this when I was a teenager and if the kids got out of control, I would grab an adult and they would take of it. The only time I ever disciplined a child was my younger siblings because I became a third parent.", "The kid in this case was actively abusing the other children, I get that quitting your job and getting someone else to fix it for you is easier and less messy but sometimes you have to actually do it yourself and if talking gets ignored yelling can be appropriate.", "Show this to your brother, I have ADHD. I am 56 years old. My mother refused to have an unruly rude daughter. I was made to behave and had  consequences. I had things taken away, was rewarded for good behavior.  Your son is a monster, he will not have friends, other children will shun him, you will have people uninvite you , because they don\u2019t want to be around your son. He needs to learn now , how to act and there is expectations. You really allow your son to put his dirty hands in others food? You are lazy parents raising an entitled child who acts worse than an animal. With ADHD I have a masters in history and a bachelor in technology. I thank my mother everyday she took the time to teach me manners , to think about others, and how not use a disability as an excuse. You have done your son a disservice. At some point CPS will get involved if you don\u2019t control your child, he is going to hurt someone", "NTA. While it\u2019s not right to yell at a kid, I understand. But it was doubly wrong for his mom to yell at you and call you out of your name. Period. \n\nMy rule is that if you can\u2019t manage your children and you don\u2019t want anyone else to, the keep your kids with you!! \n\nI wouldn\u2019t babysit Sam again. She can keep her own kid.", "NTA. Hopefully that experience taught him something. Doesn\u2019t sound like his parents are teaching him a damn thing.", "So from what I read here, I assume if Sam gets an ADHD diagnosis that his behavior won\u2019t improve and the parents will continue to blame his poor behavior on that. I think his parents need to take responsibility and actually let Sam know that Sam\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t acceptable.", "Your brother needs to parent his own kid better but also never yell at a kid that ain\u2019t yours; end of, family or not.", "Oh, FFS. Yes, YTA.\n\n\"I lost my temper and started yelling at Sam...\"\n\nThat's all I had to read. He pushed your buttons. You lost your temper. He won. But you're the adult and are expected to behave better.\n\nThings to consider next time:\n\nRequire one of Sam's parents to stay with him at all times. Try to make that non-negotiable. I'm sure they would like a respite. Too bad for them. They can't pretend that their child is no more difficult to manage than the rest.\n\nIf Sam's parent refuse to be responsible for his behavior, one of the cousins tasked with watching children needs to be assigned to focus purely on Sam. That doesn't have to be an all-day assignment. Taking turns is fine. But someone needs to have \"Sam duty\" at all times. Whoever was last assigned doesn't get to stop unless and until someone else confirms that they have taken over.\n\nWhen Sam misbehaves, pick him up and take him to one of his parents so that they can reprimand him. Clearly, you telling him to stop doesn't work, so don't waste your breath, and don't bother getting angry.", "NTA", "Why is every spoiled undisciplined brat now called \u201cneurodivergent\u201d?

Every snowflake parent out there thinks the world needs to bow down to their brat.", "This gentle parenting approach doesn\u2019t work on all kids and I really need people to stop suggesting it all the time.", "And we\u2019re you going going to call out OP for leaving the children unattended if she did go out to find the parents?", "Maybe, maybe not. My son, who's an adult now, was diagnosed high functioning autistic and adhd. He would run around the classroom in school, ran screaming down the halls first one outside for a firedrill, many, many inappropriate behaviors in school and at home. When he was a toddler he kept running into the street even while I was screaming for him to stop. IEP. many FBA's, 1:1 aides, many behavior modifications, medication starting at age 5. He continues to see his neurologist for his medication. It really takes a village to do and implement both structure at home and at school to achieve the results. If they're in the US, they dont have to just wait on a wait list to see a doctor. The child can be evaluated by the school districts child study team for their own evaluation(they do not diagnose). Early intervention covers services from birth to 3 years old. From 3 years old on is the responsibility of the school district. He may be eligible for an IEP or 504 plan based on the school districts results.", "Have 2 with ADHD. I really think this is the problem.", "That\u2019s great for your kid but I also think we really need to stop labeling the behavior that OP described as ADHD all the time. Some parent don\u2019t discipline and their kids so what they get away with.", "Bullying other kids is not an appropriate coping mechanism and should absolutely be punished. Do the other kids' boundaries not matter?\n\nOP's nephew isn't the only kid with feelings, and possibly not the only ND kid that was in that room.", "It can be both. But no matter if ADHD is involved or not, the solution is to announce and follow up with frequent but light consequences (smaller punishments, smaller rewards, more of both). ADHD needs more parenting, not less. No big punishments, just small, steady, predictable consequences.", "I have 2 with ADHD. This is the way. And if he is ADHD, he needs parents or someone there reminding him to slow down and think or else there is this consequence, and standing by that. \n\nIt's almost child abuse that they aren't, as they seem to be raising a bully.", "NTA. They're on a waiting list for what? \"He has ADHD, we're just waiting on the doc to mindlessly \"confirm\" our \"diagnosis\" this so we can drug him into being a submissive zombie.\"\n\nTHEY are the assholes on several counts though.", "NTA, bring a belt next time so he really learns.", "NTA. The kid has no respect for anyone at all.", "NTA. He is a reason why people yell.", "NTA, I probably would have done the same thing. It's ok to have emotions regardless of what others say. Sometimes a stern tone is what is needed and clearly it worked and the brat quit touching everyone's food.", "NTA as a childcare worker, kids need to learn that respect is a two way street. While yelling wasn't the best reaction, it's hard not to when in that situation. Kids are way more capable than we give them credit for, and there is a big difference between ADHD and intentionally bugging others for a reaction.", "NTA maybe it's a blessing", "NTA.

She'll be the surprised one when the she reaps the result of that...", "Truth.  Some brats just need to be yelled at.

It doesn\u2019t change anything? If I am a helicopter pilot who crashes every flight, it doesn\u2019t somehow make a different pilot who crashes every flight a good pilot.
