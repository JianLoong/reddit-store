{"id": 17120, "submission_id": "13g7gid", "title": "AITA for getting a cat?", "selftext": "I (21F) was asked to leave my parents home. It was a nasty situation in general and I am glad I am out. I have my own apartment and pay my own bills. I have a lot of trauma from everything that went down. I struggle being alone. It does not help that right after I moved out, a man did to me one of the worst things a man could do to a woman. It kind of added to it all. I decided to get myself a pet so that I am not constantly alone. When I am alone, I get really bad anxiety. I really do not want to use medicine so I went for an ESA. I originally wanted a dog but my work schedule is all over the place. I could not give a dog consistency nor could I give a dog lots of time outside so I got a cat, which is a little more independent. She is a rescue and the sweetest thing in the world. There is so much healing that she has done and so much that I have done. Now my sisters who conspired to get me kicked out of my parents home are complaining that they cannot visit me or move in with me because they're allergic to cats. And best of all, my stepmother is allergic to cats. I say good riddance and others are telling me that I should not have gotten a cat. That my sisters are young and that my relationship with my siblings is more important then some cat. Some are calling me cold hearted and unforgiving.\nEdit: INFO My sisters are bringing up things like moving in because now my stepmom is treating them like crap too. My dad no longer wants to argue with his wife because she threatened to leave him when she saw I talked bad about her on a text conversation with a friend while she was searching my phone. (She did the same thing about me). She told him me or her and he chose her and refuses to believe anything my sisters complain about. So they're getting grounded and treated like kids. Suddenly my pregnancy tests and contraceptives seem tolerable and less of a problem to my sisters. One of my sisters may have been hiding that she is gay and got caught. She is still a minor but not far from adulthood. They will abandon her and disown her if she is. I have no ounce of pity towards them.", "created_utc": 1683953071, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13g7gid/aita_for_getting_a_cat/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you lived in the same house and got a cat knowing they were allergic I would say it\u2019s an AH move but you live on your own so you have every right (this coming from someone who is highly allergic to cats).

I understand that after such painful events, you need to focus on healing and I'm sorry your family aren't supporting you through that very vulnerable process.\n\nI know that not everyone's allergies are the same, but I've been able to manage living with cats while allergic so if they really wanted to see you and support you it should be very possible so long as it's not a severe allergy. It's obvious they don't want to visit or support you though. \n\n\nRegarding your edit, your family's dynamic is horribly toxic. I'm sorry that your father is effectively abandoning you. I hope he can come to his senses one day and try to make it up to you. If that's even possible. I'm hopeful that this is a wake-up call for your step sisters about their toxic behavior. \n\nUltimately, it seems that they aren't your problem anymore.

Getting a cat as long as think of their long-term needs is pretty reasonable. They are with you 24/7. You can meet sister's outside home.\n\nAlso be careful the real story is your cat makes your sisters unable to move in. Good. Sounds like you were family scapegoat, they acted against you and now are realising that cost. Let them in and you'll be bottom of the heap again but paying for the privilege.

Let me find the link real quick", "This stuff. It's pricey, but it really works, and given that cats have pretty small appetites even an expensive food is often worth it.

Taking care of your health is valid. Doing what is right for your mental health is fabulously rewarding. That is your apartment and your space the only rules that you need to deal with are your own and the property owners. Taking allergy medication to visit a sibling is not an unusual request. Trying to dictate someone else's life for them when you haven't asked for it is not okay. Learning what boundaries are is something that it sounds like your siblings need to learn. I am so glad that you are dealing with your trauma and getting help that works for you. Keep up the good positive work. Anytime someone gives me unsolicited unwanted and unhealthy advice I answer the same every time. I thank them for the advice and for thinking of me. That does not mean I agree with them it does not mean I'm going to take the advice I'm not getting into an argument about their advice I'm just thanking them for thinking about me and dropping it. Something I know is that I've had to adapt coping mechanisms as I've aged. If you want to tell me thank you for that advice and thank you for thinking of you I am totally okay with it. Be safe and enjoy your new space.", "NTA. Thank you for rescuing the cat. You don't owe your siblings an allergen free home just so they can visit. It's *your* home for *your* needs.  Moving away from siblings is part of growing up. Everyone has to go through it. \n\nFor what it's worth, I'm allergic to cats and currently share my home with 6. I make it work.", "The reason why they bounced it is because now that I am gone, they are the targets of my stepmother's problems.

They don't like it now that they're out there getting their things searched like they're children.", "She really is", "Because now that I am gone, my stepmother has decided to treat them like crap too. They see now and do not realize I over-heard their conversations with her where they collectively agreed they needed evidence to kick me out. I got tired of being treated like a child. Of having my phone and laptop searched on a regular basis to see if I was talking to a guy or something when I was a full grown woman. I was tracked. I was dehumanized for not staying pure... it was rediculous.", "Well my sisters are complaining to family members about their living situation now. And family feels the need to also give their opinions. I don't want my sisters knowing that I heard them all conspire so I am not telling family that I knew too. I feel bad because those family members do not know. I wish they could. But it would get back to them if I told anyone. My sisters are young and made bad decisions. I do believe people can make mistakes, but it cost me everything. They all made their beds and made themselves out to be saints with no heathen ways. I guess even the flawless saints are picked at in my parents home.", "She is staying whether people think ill of me or not. She is laying with me now all curled up in a ball. She had a rough past too. Abandoned. Has her ear clipped from a TNR. Not even the shelter thought she would get to the point she is now. She was so shy in that shelter that she would lay in her own litter to get as far away from people as she could. Recently she has been getting really vocal too. Still doesn't like huge fast loud movements tho. Skittish still. Has the tortitude all the way. We are healing each other.", "My cat doesn't like other people. Not in an aggressive way though. She literally hides in my box spring. She found a little spot she could crawl in and she does when they ever do bounce by. I do not think they will be able to do anything to my cat. I cannot even get her out of there when she is hell bent on hiding in there. \ud83e\udd23", "Cool I didn't know they had that. But in OP's case she should feed her cat all the allergens to keep her toxic family away.", "I have considered getting another cat. I am not sure how my cat will respond to it. I've given some details of her story before I think in another comment. She is a rescue. She's been abandoned.  She did not respond to the shelter well,  going as far as laying in her own litter to get away from the other cats and people. She had been in that shelter for well over a month. She wanted nothing to do with the others.", "Sucks to be them. They are responsible for their own situation.

Funny how that played out now that my stepmom cannot blame me for being the family's problem or the reason why everyone is fighting. I just stood my ground when we butt heads. Now the butt kissers are the ones being treated like maids. I wonder what they thought they would gain with it. They're having so much fun being told to pack my stepbrother's lunches because he's a man and being told to clean my parents nasty bathroom all the while I live in peace and quiet.", "Ahhh not only that... I disgraced the family name because of that according to my father. He still requests to stay in touch. He is clingy even when he does see me. Really its all too confusing to me.

I understand that someday if they haven't already they will come to realize that what they did was messed up. But they do not get to dictate how I choose to heal and live my life. They cost me everything. They're not gonna reap the good that I got out of it. They've not apologized. They do not know all that I know.
