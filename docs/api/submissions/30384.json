{"id": 30384, "submission_id": "17ok9r0", "title": "AITA for \"ruining\" my cousin's honeymoon after not being invited to her wedding?", "selftext": "\r\rI (27F) have a cousin (27F), we'll call her Kathy (fake name), who got married last weekend. For some background, two years ago I inherited a cabin in the mountains from my maternal grandmother after she died. This is not the grandmother Kathy and I share. It's in a peak mountain town with lots of activities around. For the first year, I lived in it, fixing it up to eventually rent as an Airbnb.\r  \n\r  \nDuring that time, Kathy would visit periodically and stay with me. Once I moved out and placed it on Airbnb, she would continue to ask for a week or so to stay in the cabin when it wasn't peak season.\r  \n\r  \nShe loved it so much. She asked if she could use it as her honeymoon location. I told her yes and blocked out the dates on Airbnb for her honeymoon, which would have been this week. I told her congratulations and that I'd stockpile the Airbnb with a bunch of romantic stuff (candles, rose petals, etc.) as her wedding gift. She was so excited. That was back in May.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, three months ago, I got a call from my aunt. Apparently, my whole family and I weren't invited to the wedding. We were shocked as we had assumed we'd be coming. My aunt told us that my cousin said, \"She doesn't know us well,\" and that \"we weren't there for her childhood.\" We do live in different states. We didn't hear from my aunt or cousin again.\r  \n\r  \nInstead for the weekend of Halloween, my family and I changed our plane tickets (they weren't refundable) and skipped a major snowstorm in our hometown to live it up in Florida for the week.\r  \n\r  \nThis is where I may have been an asshole. For a while, I considered just leaving everything alone. But as of Nov. 1st, ski season starts and it would be a big week. Honestly, I needed the money. So a week after I was told I wasn't invited, I decided to text Kathy, that I was going to remove her reservation from my Airbnb unless she wanted to pay for the dates. I never got a response. No, she didn't block me. I can see the text went through. I texted her one more time about two months ago before putting my Airbnb back online for that week. No response. It booked up within 24 hours.\r  \n\r  \nThe day after her wedding, she texted me and asked me when she could expect the cabin to be ready. I texted her back that I told her months prior that I was going to rent it out to someone else unless she paid. It's already booked and unavailable.\r  \n\r  \nTo say she was mad is an understatement. She cried and called me an a-hole. \u201cThis was supposed to be my wedding gift to her,\u201d she yelled. I told her that only invited guests are supposed to give gifts and that strangers always have to pay to use my Airbnb. \r  \n\r  \nNow she is calling out my family as a-holes for being butthurt about not having an invite. She's using her excuse that we weren't there during her childhood and that she deserves to use the cabin. My immediate family thinks I did nothing wrong, but the rest of my family said I should give in. I agree it was a petty move, but AITA?", "created_utc": 1699214408, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ok9r0/aita_for_ruining_my_cousins_honeymoon_after_not/", "score": 5837, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Pick a lane and stick to it, lady. You don\u2019t get this both ways. \n\nAlso, pretending she didn\u2019t see your texts and then throwing a temper tantrum over her ghosting you is far more petty than you canceling her reservation because she didn\u2019t invite you to the wedding. \u201cWell well well, if it isn\u2019t the consequences of my own actions\u201d.", "Nta. You gave her plenty of notice and even offered an option of her paying for the dates.

Estrangement can be a two way street, and in this case I'd be asking her where did she engage with me during that same time period.", "I hate the stories of family members who believe they are entitle to everything but are not reciprocal.\n\nJust as she has the right not to invite you to her wedding, you have the right not to allow her to stay on your property. You warned her with enough time in advance to prepare another honeymoon destination and she chose to ignore you.\n\nThe worst thing is that she tells you that that was your wedding gift!!! a wedding to which neither you nor your family were invited!!\n\n100% NTA", "NTA.  You\u2019re right\u2026you don\u2019t owe anyone a wedding gift, especially if they don\u2019t even invite you to the wedding.  You actually warned her that she would have to pay for the cabin.  Twice.  She ignored you.  Perhaps she thought you wouldn\u2019t follow through.  But this cabin is wholly unconnected to her.  And she\u2019s the one who put you on the same level as virtual strangers.  And strangers don\u2019t loan out their private property for free.\n\nShe f@cked around and has now found out.

She cried and called me an a-hole. \u201cThis was supposed to be my wedding gift to her,\u201d she yelled. I told her that only invited guests are supposed to give gifts...\n\nIt's basic wedding etiquette. Gifts from wedding guests are not required but always welcome. The bride and groom should not expect gifts from anyone who declined the wedding invitation or anyone who was not invited. Apparently she's never read any of Miss Manners etiquette columns.", ">we weren't there during her childhood and that she deserves to use the cabin. \n\nThat also means that she wasn't there during your childhood and she deserves nothing.\n\n>the rest of my family said I should give in.\n\n1.

Good thing is that you all live in different states and don't have to deal with her.", "NTA. Had she invited you, the costs for the cabin would have been an invitation and food and drinks for a night. Instead she didn't even bother inviting you, ignored your texts on purpose and now sets the family up against you. She basically called you a stranger even though she made use of the cabin a lot previously. I'd be petty and send the family the link to this post, so they can see what happened and why exactly she didn't get what she was promised. I'm guessing there will be many people who'll judge you NTA.", "Lol. This is exactly what she was hoping for. She saw your texts and just didn't respond because she assumed she would be able to pressure you into it when the day arrived.

Don't give in to this silliness. \nNTA.", "NTA\n\nNot invited to the wedding = no wedding gift, that's just how it is. Besides that she had plenty of time to arrange payment for the cabin.

Either you're family and invited wedding guests in which case the week at the cabin was an appropriate wedding gift OR you're not family and not invited to the wedding and it's inappropriate for her to expect a gift.", "NTA. And not a petty move, at all! You did not feel comfortable having \u201cfamily\u201d stay at your cabin for free as a wedding gift for a wedding you weren\u2019t invited to attend. When your family members are telling you to \u201cgive in\u201d what exactly do they expect you to do? You gave her two options: pay or cancel her reservation and she didn\u2019t have the courtesy to follow up about either. You were in the right to move forward with a paying reservation.\n\nEdit: wtf is up with her comments on childhood. Does she have a new therapist? Do the weeks she spent with you at the cabin or your generosity in sharing the cabin for free mean nothing? Does she not understand how cousins work because she obvi doesn\u2019t understand how texting works.\n\nEdit 2: don\u2019t take crap from the haters. You weren\u2019t obligated to gift anything even if you were invited to the wedding. share text thread with your family and ask them to stay out of the situation.\n\nBTW did you get invited to the wedding and then uninvited???", "Uhm.... She knows you well enough that she was a regular houseguest at your cabin & for her to feel comfortable with you providing a fairly extravagant wedding gift but not close enough to merit a wedding invitation? \n\nInteresting metric she's using.\n\nNTA", "You gave her a lot of notice on the situation. You had texted her several months in advance and told her the situation and gave her options. Kathy knew you well enough to hang out and fall in love with the cabin and to have a discussion about it with you. And then suddenly she doesn't know you? But she still wants something from you?\n\nNTA, but you might not have her as a cousin anymore. It's not sounding like a huge loss.", "Wow, expecting a free honeymoon without even inviting that person has to be either the most brass balls move or the stupidest move I\u2019ve read all day. No invite, no gift is pretty common sense, your cousin really screwed herself. NTA, this is hilarious \ud83d\ude06", "NTA. You were not close, she said so. She was only close to you because of the cabine. And she wasn't able to talk about this like adults (like 'sorry, but I have to make cuts because of the price and I don't want to upset anyone by only inviting you from your family half - or something like that) If she had called herself, you could have discussed it. So you let her know in advance that she can't have the cabine and she still thaught you would give in. NTA", "NTA.\n\nit was supposed to be her wedding gift?! is she for real? what an entitled b****. you did the right thing.\nperhaps she ignored your messages intentionally because she thought you won't rent out the cabin if you didn't hear from her", "If I don't invite you to my wedding, then I do not expect a gift from you and have no right to expect one.    \n\n\nNTA of course.  You need the money, you do your thing.  She's a user.", "NTA. Excuse  me, she \u201ddeserves\u201c to use the cabin? Not entitled much, is she? You weren\u2019t invited to the wedding, but she still expected a gift? Especially the use of your cabin when it could be making you $$$. Do not give in. I love your response about \u201c only invited guests are supposed to give gifts\u201d. Classic. Two thumbs up.", "NTA Yep i would do the same wedding gifts are for those invited to the wedding", "NTA. If you werent close enough to be invited to the wedding you arent close enough for her to ask this of you. Dont give in!", "The hypocrisy of her. She\u2019s only your family when it suits her. Her reasons for not inviting you to her wedding were ridiculous. Why would you have needed to be there for her in her childhood? Did she have some traumatic upbringing and was ignored when she reached out to your family. If not then I would have done the same.", "NTA\n\nYou clearly warned her, it's not your fault she thought you were bluffing, she didn't even bother to respond.\n\nIt's a petty move, sure, but she did it first by using a lame excuse.  \nIt reminds me of the father who paid for his daughter's wedding venue just to be told he wasn't invited. He canceled the reservation and get the refund.", "NTA - it sounds like she didn\u2019t want the expense of hosting your family at her wedding but she felt fine with you taking a loss on rental income", "NTA. Why would she expect such an expensive gift when you guys aren\u2019t close -per her own words. She\u2019ll be fine. She is certainly entitled!", "You tried to contact her multiple times and she didn't respond, NTA.", "It is exceedingly unusual for people who were not wedding guests to give wedding gifts.

Then, her mother delivers the news since, after all, y'all are strangers, and mom always said don't talk to strangers.\n\nNTA\n\nYou said it perfectly, \"only invited guests are supposed to give gifts and that strangers always have to pay to use my Airbnb.\" You gave her ample time to pay for the AirBnB or even simply respond to your message. This is on her.", "NTA. She\u2019s just mad that she tried to use you and it blew up in her face. She ignored the texts hoping you would chicken out or forget. She\u2019s a major AH.", "NTA. She can't have it both ways. You're not close enough to be invited to her wedding, so why on earth would you give her such an extravagant gift? Or any gift at all?", "If you're not close enough to invite to the wedding, you're not close enough to give a wedding gift. \n\nNTA", "So she's not close enough to you to want you to even attend her wedding, but expects to get to use your cabin for free?\n\nNo effin way!! You're absolutely NTA, and I think you did everything right (giving her fair warning etc.)", "NTA- she has spent significant time with you and at your cabin in recent years. \n\n>During that time, Kathy would visit periodically and stay with me. Once I moved out and placed it on Airbnb, she would continue to ask for a week or so to stay in the cabin when it wasn't peak season.\n\nThe excuse of not \"knowing each other during childhood\" is completely insane. I can't imagine not inviting immediate family within grandparents, aunts/uncles/cousins to a wedding. If she wanted a free honeymoon, she should be less of an A", "Stocking up a cabin for a honeymoon and letting her use it for free is a big gift, especially at the start of ski season! A gift like that doesn\u2019t come from a \u201cstranger\u201d or someone who isn\u2019t even invited to the wedding. Plus, you gave her ample notice that the cabin was still available if she wanted to pay for it and she chose to ignore your warnings. Tell her the cabin is only free for people that were there for you in your childhood lol. NTA.", "\"Strangers pay for my cabin\" *drops mic* Legendary. NTA", "NTA\n\nShe FAFO. She chose not to invite you to her wedding and STILL expected an expensive gift (a free honeymoon). You had even texted her to ask if she still wanted it, and she ignored you.", "NTA.   \nYour entitled cousin learnt that being an AH has consequences.", "NTA-When you\u2019re good enough to be considered family when you have something she wants but not good enough to be considered family to attend a family event like a wedding you aren\u2019t family.

If you hadn't given her plenty of notice, it'd be different.  Sure, it was a LITTLE petty, but just a little.  Your cousin knows you well enough to ask for favors and gifts, but not enough to invite you to her wedding, not enough to be bothered to respond to your texts. And to demand a gift when you were deliberately not invited to the wedding? Omg.\n\nYou didn't ruin anything.  She ruined it herself with her entitled behavior. The family who is saying you're an AH can pony up the money and pay for her honeymoon.", "NTA of course. She has made it very clear that she's just using you and doesn't see you as a relative or even a friend at all. Also what your extended family thinks doesn't matter.

That's some low class behavior.", "You weren\u2019t there for her during childhood, but she sure found a free place to stay when you inherited a cabin.", "NTA. I have a feeling you were invited to the wedding only so your cousin could get a free honeymoon, and the plan was to cancel the invite because they thought you wouldn't have the balls to cancel her reservation.", "Nta.I think she is just using you for the cabin and two months notice is plenty.Also extremely inconsiderate that she didn\u2019t even invite you when you seemed to have a good relationship.", "NTA- she is in coocooland", "NTA.

You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nShe doesnt invite you because you werent there during her childhood, but had no.problem exploiting your hospitality AND expect a gift from you even though you werent invited to the wedding??\n\nAnd she ignored the msg where you told her the cabin was not available for her??\n\n>rest of my family said I should give in. I agree it was a petty move, \n\nDont. Besides its rented out, yes??\n\nAnd not petty, no. She was petty by demanding a gift even though you werent invited.", "NTA. you gave her plenty of notice.

For some background, two years ago I inherited a cabin in the mountains from my maternal grandmother after she died. This is not the grandmother Kathy and I share. It's in a peak mountain town with lots of activities around. For the first year, I lived in it, fixing it up to eventually rent as an Airbnb.\r  \n\r  \nDuring that time, Kathy would visit periodically and stay with me. Once I moved out and placed it on Airbnb, she would continue to ask for a week or so to stay in the cabin when it wasn't peak season.\r  \n\r  \nShe loved it so much. She asked if she could use it as her honeymoon location. I told her yes and blocked out the dates on Airbnb for her honeymoon, which would have been this week. I told her congratulations and that I'd stockpile the Airbnb with a bunch of romantic stuff (candles, rose petals, etc.) as her wedding gift. She was so excited. That was back in May.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, three months ago, I got a call from my aunt. Apparently, my whole family and I weren't invited to the wedding. We were shocked as we had assumed we'd be coming. My aunt told us that my cousin said, \"She doesn't know us well,\" and that \"we weren't there for her childhood.\" We do live in different states. We didn't hear from my aunt or cousin again.\r  \n\r  \nInstead for the weekend of Halloween, my family and I changed our plane tickets (they weren't refundable) and skipped a major snowstorm in our hometown to live it up in Florida for the week.\r  \n\r  \nThis is where I may have been an asshole. For a while, I considered just leaving everything alone. But as of Nov. 1st, ski season starts and it would be a big week. Honestly, I needed the money. So a week after I was told I wasn't invited, I decided to text Kathy, that I was going to remove her reservation from my Airbnb unless she wanted to pay for the dates. I never got a response. No, she didn't block me. I can see the text went through. I texted her one more time about two months ago before putting my Airbnb back online for that week. No response. It booked up within 24 hours.\r  \n\r  \nThe day after her wedding, she texted me and asked me when she could expect the cabin to be ready. I texted her back that I told her months prior that I was going to rent it out to someone else unless she paid. It's already booked and unavailable.\r  \n\r  \nTo say she was mad is an understatement. She cried and called me an a-hole. \u201cThis was supposed to be my wedding gift to her,\u201d she yelled. I told her that only invited guests are supposed to give gifts and that strangers always have to pay to use my Airbnb. \r  \n\r  \nNow she is calling out my family as a-holes for being butthurt about not having an invite. She's using her excuse that we weren't there during her childhood and that she deserves to use the cabin. My immediate family thinks I did nothing wrong, but the rest of my family said I should give in. I agree it was a petty move, but AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
