The dog was laying beside me while we were lounging on the bed and his youngest daughter was laying on the floor by me playing on her iPad. I moved and the dog didn't like it and jumped down on the youngest and scratched her stomach. She cried and my bf said I pushed the dog down, which I did not. He attended to her while I left the room and took the dogs out because I was mad he had accused me of hurting his child and didn't want the situation to esculate. I took the dogs outside while he got an icepack to put on her and calmed her down. I went back up to check on her, bf told me she was fine, just a scratch. I noticed his oldest daughter had gone to her room. I assumed she was getting ready to go to Michael's with me because I said I would take them. So I went downstairs and gathered my things togehter and was going to move the 50 pound dog food bag I had in me backseat to the trunk for the kids. My bf came down and I waited for him. I told him that I did not like that he accused me of pushing the dog on her. He told me he was joking and to lighten up. Things escalated and he asked me to leave. So I left. About 10 minutes later he sent me a text telling me I ditched his kids and they were crying and it was all my fault. I reminded him he asked me to leave. He said I was leaving because I had my things together. I explained why I had my things (purse and jacket) and he basically told me I was a liar. He ended his end of the conversation with 'F\\*\\*\\* you. You are in the car by yourself fixated on this. I am not. {youngest kid} is crying and {oldest kid} is upset. So f\\*\\*\\* you very much. Bye.' I text back that he text me when I was going to leave it alone. We have not had any contact since.   \n\n\nA bit of background; We have rarely fought.

When we did, he always said something outrageous and I backed down to keep the peace.\n\nThis is literally the hallmarker of an abusive relationship, or a blazing red warning sign of one about to begin. This is only going to escalate.\n\nEither\n\n1) You continue to back down and it progressively gets worse, where you're bowing to almost every batshit thing he says, slowly ripping away your sense of autonomy as he progressively escalates the accusations. Everything is your fault, all the time. You're walking on eggshells trying to prevent anything you could possibly be accused for; you end up being responsible for everything.\n\nOr\n\n2) You keep standing up for yourself, and live in a household/relationship that's constantly volatile. Everything becomes an argument, everything is a hint of an argument, there is no room for mistakes anymore without starting yet another argument. Most likely slowly becoming more and more bitter.\n\nThis is just how these sorts of relationships evolve. I don't know about most people, but this sort of thing was demonstrated to me often in my own family and extended family. Usually relationships and familial were #1, and #2 was more likely to be parent-child relationships (before said child eventually goes no contact, which was my own case).\n\nThere's literally no reason for him to have accused you of these things. None. Completely unreasonable assumptions and assertions. There is only one reason to do this, and that is he *wanted* to fight. As to why someone would do this is unknown, really, it leads to an extremely miserable life and relationship. But some do.\n\nMaybe it's all they know. Maybe on some subconscious level, they've learned to associate the behavior with benefiting. It's rarely a conscious master plan.

Something like this would mean permanently cutting contact.", "That all tracks. Just as this disagreement seems to be entirely your fault in his mind. People who can never admit to being wrong don't really make great partners. (Or coworkers, or parents, or much else.)", "I get his child got hurt so emotions where high  and heat of the moment you don't always think what you about to say, with him saying he was joking he knew he was wrong to say that, if you want to break the ice with him then maybe just msg asking how kids are, but don't apologise", "I couldn't even finish reading. I'll take your word that it's good advice.", "\ud83e\udd23 same!", "NTA.  He's trying to manipulate you and make you feel bad for things you didn't do.  This is some b.s. twisted logic on his part.  Who says fuck you to their partner?  You want to be with someone that treats you like this, thats on you.  He's showing you how he really is, believe him.  It's not going to get better.", "Please leave the situation now before it gets worse. Please! I had a close friend who go with a bf and the early stages of the relationship sounded exactly like this.

My boyfriend occasionally reminds me of my ex-husband. I should have realized then.", "Run and do not look back. His behavior is unacceptable. You deserve better!
