I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt that sick before, I\u2019m still sick but no longer feel like I\u2019m dying. Yesterday in the morning I made my famous Get Better Soon Soup that I only make when someone in the family or friends circle is sick. Chopping and slicing and general cooking stuff wiped me the F out, but it was so worth it. Husband was at work and I wanted soup, no big deal. \n\nWe often bring his mom food since she lives nearby and we like to help/spend time with her. When my husband came home to me laying on the couch much like a dead fish lays on the beach, he declared the soup smelled amazing and then asked me to put some in to go containers for him and his mom to eat. I just looked at him and very slowly and very quietly said, \u201cI\u2019m still really sick, and I\u2019m the one who had to make the soup, it really took a lot out of me, can you Please do it yourself.\u201d I did not succeed in keeping the annoyance out of my voice. He said yes, also a little annoyed. \n\nAs he approached the stove he asked \u201cdo you think it\u2019s hot enough for us to eat right away, or will I have to heat it up when I get there?\u201d. And then I lost it. I yelled, I couldn\u2019t help myself, I was so annoyed and shocked at his first question, I really couldn\u2019t handle how incredibly incompetent this new question was. I said \u201cGive me a break, please lord you have to be kidding me. You are a grown man, with hands, and a brain. You cannot be asking me about the temperature of something you\u2019re standing over. Tell me you\u2019re fucking with me.\u201d He was standing there shocked and a little hurt, I felt bad, but not that bad! All he had to do was ladle the soup into the to go containers, he\u2019d be able to feel the heat through the container. Or he could have tried it. Or he could have done literally anything other than ask me that question. Stick your wingwang in there for all I care! \n\nHe really didn\u2019t say much, just packed up the soups, and left. Everything is fine, he seems to have chalked it up to \u2018she\u2019s sick and in a bad mood\u2019 (which he\u2019s not wrong) and has forgotten about it. I did not apologize, nor has he asked or seemed like he needed one. Everything\u2019s all good but I told my mom this story and she said I was a jerk and should apologize.

This is the most ridiculous case of weaponized incompetence I've ever heard. \"I'm too helpless to figure out how warm this liquid is which I am currently holding, wifey needs to get up and figure it out for me.\" \n\nI am giggling so much at this grown-ass man not being able to figure out something so simple. And of course, he could have figured it out by using his own God-given senses. He just wanted you to do it for him. What a maroon. \n\nWives/ girlfriends/ partners everywhere - we need to stop coddling these men and let them stand on their own two feet - or let them fall...into the possibly hot soup.", "I\u2019m assuming this may not be the first time he\u2019s added to the mental load so NTA. Side note- I\u2019ve made it a habit when I feel like I\u2019m stressed or sick or just don\u2019t want to make any more choices\u2026and I\u2019ve lived with guys my whole\u2026by literally saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to make any more choices so it\u2019s up to you.\u201d This usually helps them from asking anything else lol\n\nAlso hope you\u2019re feeling better!", "NTA I\u2019m actually more shocked that he took the soup for him and his mother when you\u2019re the one sick and had to make it yourself. They\u2019re both healthy and feeling fine. Why couldn\u2019t they make their own dinner and leave the feel better soon soup leftovers for the person who\u2019s actually sick? Selfish and inconsiderate SOBs if you ask me", "Listen, I would be pissed for him sharing soup with anyone else I made while sick \nNTA", "NTA- Do not apologize for calling him out on his weaponized incompetence.  It matters not that you didn't feel well.  He's an adult human being with a (presumably) functional brain.  Do you have to adjust the shower water for him?  No?  Then he can figure this out for himself.", "NTA and I hope he didn't take so much soup that you would need to make more to have enough to take you through to recovery.", "NTA\n\nThere is no apology needed he knows he deserved how you reacted", "NTA\n\nI HATE this. I have literally had people WHO ARE HOLDING A SMARTPHONE ask me the time before, when I am not holding my phone.\n\nIt\u2019s infuriating. Him chalking it up to you being sick and in a bad mood is also him being an asshole. You may have overreacted, but it was a stupid question - that\u2019s the root issue here. Not your illness.", "I mean you shouldn't really yell at him, but asking you to put the soup into to go containers is so ridiculous that I'm guessing there's a whole pattern of weaponized incompetence and acting like you're his mommy so I'm gonna go with NTA, unless I'm wrong about that.", ">Everything is fine, he seems to have chalked it up to \u2018she\u2019s sick and in a bad mood\u2019 (which he\u2019s not wrong) and has forgotten about it.

I wouldn't make a deal out of it though.   Give him a big wet kiss and maybe he will be more understanding when he contracts a nasty bacterial infection in his chest and sinuses.   Not really.

I would\u2019ve probably gone Y T A for the strong reaction if it was just the temp question, but asking you to put the soup in containers when you\u2019re sick and put all that work into making it made me so mad, so I get it.", "YTA, what an uncalled for reaction, didn\u2019t realize you\u2019re allowed to bite someone\u2019s head off for asking a question.

Your husband seems like he\u2019s a bit daft and tone deaf.", "ESH, he could have checked on you better and got the soup himself without asking stupid questions, but yelling at him wasn't the right way to go about that either. Getting yelled at sucks.", "[deleted]", "YTA. It was a innocent question and i truly cannot understand how people think that freaking out over something simple things. Even if its annoying, yelling about it doesn't help anyone.", "YTA", "YTA. Sure it was a silly question but you didn't need to bite his head off. \"Up to you\" would've sent the same message, telling him to figure it out for himself.", "NAH. \n\nHe sounds as oblivious as many spouses can be when the household doer-of-things is incapacitated.\n\nFor you to tell him you are sick and worn out and then for him to be unable to manage the very basic task on his own, it sounds like you shoulder a lot of the mental load at home.\n\n Probably time for a calm chat after you are feeling 100% and you can then try to navigate discussing some of the household things that he should be doing more actively.", "YTA; you sound miserable to be around.", "NAH\n\nYou were probably a little harsh, but who wouldn't be with such dumb questions!", "ETA  \n\nYelling at people because they're stupid is an ahole thing... It might feel good but we must resist. Just preserve your energy and say \"you've got this kid...I believe in you\"\n\nBeing completely oblivious and reliant on your sick partner over something as simple as basic human skills- a total Ahole move...", "YTA, he was simply asking a question about how fresh the soup was", "ESH yes he is an adult and should be able to deduce these things himself, maybe he was thinking out loud more than asking, either way you *way* overreacted", "ESH I totally understand being annoyed at his stupid questions and even more annoyed he didn't ask how you were when he got home. But yelling at him wasn't the way to go, it could have been handled better.", "YTA - unless I am missing something, you blew up at him for asking a stupid question.\n\nSeems like a huge overreaction for a minor annoyance. \n\nDoes he have a history of asking for your help with every little thing?", "Yeah ...being sick doesn't give you a free pass to yell at people\n\nWhat if your husband did this to you...how would you feel?\n\nYTA", "sorry to say but YTA.

One of the main things that will end a relationship is contempt.  Re-read what you said to him.  Did he really deserve what you said?  Was he being a bit of a wuss?  maybe.  Sure, let's call it what it is.  But I will tell you, you would probably be shocked at the number of times he mumbled about you being a \"B\" or \"C\" to himself in the car when he left.  THAT is on you.  A guy cannot survive in an environment like the one you put him in.  He's going to go silent and detach.  And no, he hasn't forgotten about it.
