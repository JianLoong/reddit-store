I just looked at him and very slowly and very quietly said, \u201cI\u2019m still really sick, and I\u2019m the one who had to make the soup, it really took a lot out of me, can you Please do it yourself.\u201d I did not succeed in keeping the annoyance out of my voice.

I said \u201cGive me a break, please lord you have to be kidding me. You are a grown man, with hands, and a brain. You cannot be asking me about the temperature of something you\u2019re standing over.

You being sick may be why you responded the way you did, but that doesn't mean that you were *wrong*. Rather than apologizing, I think having a calm and rational conversation about how you are not his brain or his mommy would be better. Because, omg, that was a stupid question.

You could have said I don't know no mental thoughts required.

You're literally complaining that they took the OPs description of the exchange at face value, instead of imagining a whole other dialogue into the scene like you.", "No? It stands to reason that the women who are doing the raising need to be part of breaking the cycle?", "I'm not imagining anything! I'm saying that we don't know one way or the other whether or not the OP's husband asked how she was, because it wasn't mentioned in the post.\n\nThere's enough actual details up there to say that the OP is not TA without filling in the blanks and making assumptions about his behaviour that may or may not be the case.", "Wow you have no idea how much your blaming women for everything is part of the whole issue in the first place. Sad.", "You literally said:\n\n>If she didn't mention something, then who are we to assume it happened?\n\nSo, why are you assuming he asked her how she was feeling? She didn't mention it. By your own logic it didn't happen, otherwise she would likely have mentioned it (especially because the whole post is about him asking her to do tasks while she was sick.", "Dude, I\u2019m not blaming all women, I am specifically referring to women within family units that teach traditional gender roles - these are the places where this mentality breeds and this is where the cycle needs to be broken. I say this, as someone raised like this. I was raised to bring food and drink to my dad and be responsible for cooking. For getting a perfectly functional human a drink if he\u2019s standing in the kitchen.\n\nI don\u2019t think you understand how much UN learning some people have to do as a result of this upbringing tbh"]}
