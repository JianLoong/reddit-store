When my grandfather died when I was 3years old he left me and my siblings shares in his factory. It was written in his Will that the factory should have been sold when I (the youngest child of 4)reached 25 years old, but my dad struggled to left go of the factory as it was his families legacy, so he ended up keeping it until recently at the age of 80 he's decided to retire and sell the property. Each sibling only stands to get about 10% each of the overall sale, so after tax about \u00a3152k. This will clear my mortgage, and leave roughly \u00a340k over. My wife keeps dropping hints and saying things like \"will my sister give any to her husband?\". \" The baby has more money than me\". The thing is my wife doesn't work, she broke her back when she was 16 and whilst she can work, she doesn't. She doesn't get any money off the government or take any benefits - I pay for everything. Anything she wants I buy, anything she needs I buy. I also put money into her account for her. I've tried to encourage her to get a job, but she's literally done one day at a care home and came home crying saying it was awful and the staff were vile to the patients, so she didn't go back (yes, we reported to the CQC, and the place was investigated). I then had our daughter (19months) via IVF which is really expensive if you don't go down the NHS route, but time wasn't on our side to sit on a waiting list for ages, so I paid privately, that completely ate all my savings. We have always agreed that we want more babies, and have some fertilised eggs in storage so I want to use the remaining money on that and put a little into our daughters savings account. And possibly if we have enough a little holiday too. I don't earn loads, so I save wherever I can for us and our future. So that when I retire we have something to live off of. My wife isn't good with money and whenever I give her anything she always spends it on stupid things for herself or on her little sister (33). I'm not talking clothes or anything useful she will spend money on sweets, and Macdonalds for lunches (she has spend \u00a3100 in a week on junk food) so I'm reluctant to give her some of my inheritance to just waste. When I bought our house, our agreed understanding was always that she would get a job, and put towards the house but she never did. We equally share household chores, and she looks after the baby while I'm at work, but usually goes round to her mothers and they end up going shopping. I take over baby care as soon as I finish working, I also look after our daughter on the weekends so she gets a break, so it's not like I'm using her as free childcare or anything like that. I just don't want to share my inheritance money with her when I'm going to be spending it on something we both want anyway.", "created_utc": 1701938265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18crafl/aita_for_not_giving_my_wife_any_of_my_inheritance/", "score": 190, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You work, do 50% of the household chores and care for the baby when ever you are home. \n\nAnd she also has her mom helping care for the baby, while frittering your savings away? No, time for wife to step up and help with the household. She can either get a job or do the majority of the household chores. (Baby care still split evenly)\n\nIs her name on the house? I don\u2019t want you to doing anything that would be financial abuse, but it might be time to tighten the purse strings a little for frivolous things.

She's hinting because you aren't telling her clearly. \n\nBut why not discuss and give her a small amount for Christmas? You might not spend fun money the same way she does, but 500 is probably not going to put much of a dent in the full amount, and she'd enjoy it. But the longer you leave her in the dark, the more frustrated she'll get. \n\nBut tell her about the holiday and the budget, and maybe she'll enjoy helping plan it with you.", "Do not give her any inheritance and put on hold any further baby, as you describe a very disfunctional relationship", "I've been married 30 years.

In many states, inheritance is not considered a marital asset.

Sure childcare is different than sitting at a desk if you do, but it's not like you're napping or relaxing. Not to mention, I assume your child is still napping during the day - so that means she gets nap time or a break. \n\n>\"will my sister give any to her husband?\n\nHer 33 yo sister, or your sibling? Yeah you should pay off the mortgage and use rest for retirement or saving for school for your child. Tell her those plans and just say her getting a job would help more than the 40k leftover.
