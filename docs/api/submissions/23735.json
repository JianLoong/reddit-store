It's not like you can control when it starts or ends--if that were the case, none of us would ever have a period again!

He's a child pretending to be an adult.", "I.. What? No. Obviously NTA. \n\nFor the future: period stains aren't even remotely as difficult to get out as people assume if you take action right away. Take whatever has been stained off, and IMMEDIATELY rinse the stain out in COLD water. The colder the better. It comes out even easier if you make sure to rinse the blood out the way it came in. So if you bled on it from the outside like here, you turn the garmnet inside out and rinse it out from the inside.\n\n.. also works for blueberry jam.", "NTAH\n\nYou can't plan down to the hour when you will begin menstruating.

Your boyfriend definitely shouldn't have yelled at you and needs to be supportive.\n\nBasic partner courtesy (as the nonperiod haver) is to not get upset, make sure you are okay and have what you need, and then help clean up while you take care of yourself imo. \n\nI (24m) make sure to have a ready supply of my partner's (24f) preferred brands of feminine hygiene products, pain relievers, hydrogen peroxide, and regularly ask how I can offer support.

When it looks good (or after 3 days) take them out, rinse them well and spray with shout or whatever and then wash them in the machine. Don\u2019t dry them in a dryer unless the stain is gone. If not completely gone do the BIZ soak again. My mother taught me this many years ago and I use this method for tough stains including blood. It also works really well on tshirts that get stains under the armpits.

Go buy her tampons when she asks because absolutely nobody cares and nobody thinks you\u2019re a bitch for buying them.", "Actually, period blood is a little more than blood. But it still was inside a body without causing any problem, so it's not toxic. He won't get a burn where her blood touched him. (And I don't want to know how he'd react if they were having s#x \\[not sure if it's an acceptable word here\\] when her period starts!)", "Yeah he was a total sweetie!", "That part crushes me. If he was a good partner he'd make a bigger deal out of grabbing her a hot pad, some tea and snackies to make everything better. Oh do you need Tylenol? Oh here's a pair of my sweats don't worry if you bleed through! \n\nOP he's not meeting expectations whatsoever....", "When you put it that way it sounds like he cares more about his pants than op\u2019s health", "My wife tells me her period is starting and I'm like \"but you just had it a week or 2 ago!?\" But no it was a month ago pretty much.", "I feel you on the waking up to a murder scene part, being a woman is fun isn\u2019t it. First you wake up and think \u201cboy I\u2019m really sweaty\u201d and then you realize that is in fact blood all over your body", "A lot of places that launder clothes for you (like a wash n fold) use peroxide to wash clothes actually!", "I would just use cold water for that. Cheaper and easier to buy in the quantities needed", "I had a really funny moment at work a while back where someone assumed that the reason I know how to get blood out of clothes is because I'm a nurse not because I'm female. I'm pretty sure I've never gotten somebody else's blood on my clothes at work. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You tried lemon juice?", "I love the way you think", "But if OP was wearing panties, that would've blocked the tissue anyway like a strainer. What bf got on his pants was straight liquid, I'm sure.", "It still washes out just fine.", "How are tissues from the uterine wall any different from skin tissue that might come off if you graze your knee or something? \n\nLike I get it\u2019s not ideal to have gotten blood on him but he\u2019s acting like a jerk.", "Sometimes you feel it coming, sometimes you don\u2019t. It can be accompanied by cramps, or just slip out and you don\u2019t notice til you\u2019re in the bathroom. Also, if you\u2019re laying down for a while and stand up, it can go from being pooled in the uterus to kind of rushing out.", "Women have cloacas dontcha know ?", "holy shit", "It still comes out of clothes just the same as any other blood. Regardless, it's not like she consciously decided that moment to start her period, so his reaction is bonkers.", "Birth control is a big deal. It's great for, y'know, avoiding pregnancy, but it can mess with your system. Migraines, weight gain, drop in sex drive - all sorts of possible side effects.", "My fun fact is that even BC that can \"stop\" periods, it doesn't stop them entirely. It makes them happen less frequently, and in my experience you can't really tell when you're gonna get your next one. For example I'm on nexplanon, I don't get my period frequently now, only about 3 or 4 months, but I have no clue it's coming until after it's hit, then I realize that oh I was sad and tired and irritable because my period was coming.", "Reading it back I get it. I was just so stunned at the question that it was the only response in my head.", "I also have a lot of questions but feel like I will get shut down immediately on this sub. For example, was OP wearing underwear and/or pants? It seems like this is one of the main purposes of underwear? If she's going around sitting on furniture and laps without any underwear or pants on the day she is most likely to start her period, surely there is some level of culpability?", "It feels like 2 days ago for us lol", "My dyslexia hates this so freaking much. On the rare occasion I cook (and rarer occasion I use a recipe) I have to take extra time to rewrite \"tsp\" and \"tbs\" in longhand. I messed up so much baking before realizing the issue, lol.", "if a person treats you like shit then you're under no obligation to stay with them because \"they are young\" and they might treat you better in the future", "If I have learned anything from incels it's that women have full control of their periods just like their bladders. I don't know why my wife doesn't believe this, the incels told me it's true!", "Blood could have still gotten anywhere if she was wearing underwear or pants we don't know how heavy she bleeds.  for most women that don't have light cycles the first day and a few after that are usually the heaviest. It's completely possible she could have bled through the clothes she was wearing and even if she is a light bleeder she could have been sitting for a long period of time without noticing that she was bleeding.", "3% is a bit stronger than the average 1-2%, that could make a substantial difference", "I feel you.  I've got the numeric version of dyslexia, dyscalculia... so I screw my self over when I write out the numbers, especially if 3 digits or more and the fractions, which is like everything in baking.... hugs", "IDRC, this is not my situation. She asked whether she was the asshole in the situation, and I gave my input. That is all I really care about.", "That is true, but synthetic indigo, which is used for most jeans, is chemically identical to natural indigo. So unless your jeans are a different colour, they can still be treated in the same way as natural indigo. A friend of mine is a chemist, and worked for a company specialising in natural indigo production.", "technically black is all colours. White is the absence of colour.", "Ben's oil peroxide", "Well yes\n\nI just wasn't sure how and found myself scared to try peroxide on darks bc of that. I also know a guy that uses diluted peroxide in his hair to bleach it, but I guess that's more to do with how it reacts to something like blood vs keratin in hair", "So, you're an organic chemist or a biochemist? Or a chemical engineer?\n\nI still don't know what my organic chem professor meant about the key to learning O Chem being the reason water rolls downhill. I guess stability of potential energy? Because with hills, it's potential kinetic energy, and with molecules, it's substitutions at the position with the lowest potential energy/molecule configurations with the lowest potential energy?", "And a necessary nutrient, not just tasty.", "I'm not OP but I ruined a pair of jeans trying to use peroxide to get blood out", "I think it is Business Insider that has a series on master craftsman and they have you tube video about a Japanese indigo dyer and they talk about genuine indigo dyed jeans.", "Love you and your brain!", "This person technicalities", "Shout stain remover works on almost ALL stains. I have to stay stocked up bc my 6 year old has been messy and artsy since she started using her hands \ud83d\ude29", "No one made any such decision. We were using salt thousands of years before we understood the chemistry behind it. It naturally forms.", "Fair dos, I forgot about that part cause it\u2019s been hours since I read the post, but my point still stands. We are building the stigma around this by shaming op for having a fucking accident."]}
