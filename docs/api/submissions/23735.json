It's not like you can control when it starts or ends--if that were the case, none of us would ever have a period again!

He's a child pretending to be an adult.", "I.. What? No. Obviously NTA. \n\nFor the future: period stains aren't even remotely as difficult to get out as people assume if you take action right away. Take whatever has been stained off, and IMMEDIATELY rinse the stain out in COLD water. The colder the better. It comes out even easier if you make sure to rinse the blood out the way it came in. So if you bled on it from the outside like here, you turn the garmnet inside out and rinse it out from the inside.\n\n.. also works for blueberry jam.", "NTAH\n\nYou can't plan down to the hour when you will begin menstruating.

Your boyfriend definitely shouldn't have yelled at you and needs to be supportive.\n\nBasic partner courtesy (as the nonperiod haver) is to not get upset, make sure you are okay and have what you need, and then help clean up while you take care of yourself imo. \n\nI (24m) make sure to have a ready supply of my partner's (24f) preferred brands of feminine hygiene products, pain relievers, hydrogen peroxide, and regularly ask how I can offer support.

Otherwise it's unnecessary.      \n\nI'd also like to see your source that says men get the hormones they need every 15 minutes, because that sounds like bullshit.
