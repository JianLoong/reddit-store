It's not like you can control when it starts or ends--if that were the case, none of us would ever have a period again!

He's a child pretending to be an adult.", "I.. What? No. Obviously NTA. \n\nFor the future: period stains aren't even remotely as difficult to get out as people assume if you take action right away. Take whatever has been stained off, and IMMEDIATELY rinse the stain out in COLD water. The colder the better. It comes out even easier if you make sure to rinse the blood out the way it came in. So if you bled on it from the outside like here, you turn the garmnet inside out and rinse it out from the inside.\n\n.. also works for blueberry jam.", "NTAH\n\nYou can't plan down to the hour when you will begin menstruating.

Your boyfriend definitely shouldn't have yelled at you and needs to be supportive.\n\nBasic partner courtesy (as the nonperiod haver) is to not get upset, make sure you are okay and have what you need, and then help clean up while you take care of yourself imo. \n\nI (24m) make sure to have a ready supply of my partner's (24f) preferred brands of feminine hygiene products, pain relievers, hydrogen peroxide, and regularly ask how I can offer support.

He will not mature on a quick enough timescale to be worth OP\u2019s time and effort unless he chooses himself to go to therapy because he recognizes his own failings.", "No, im married with a wife and kids. Speaking as a former prick, that had to mature fast, the OP\u2019s BF has her controlled and scared. Its not about the period. This behaviour is how it starts, then gets worse, OP actually thinks its her fault, most likely because she is made to feel that way. This will get worse, and i am sorry that you cannot see that.", "If I spill ketchup or sauce on someone's clothes and it's appropriate for them to take them off (it's a sweater and they have a t-shirt underneath or they have a change of clothes), I would offer to wash them, same goes for blood, in my opinion. I bled on the dining room chair last night (my own chair). I washed it. It's really not a big deal. The boyfriend should not be mad at OP however, as it's an accident, it's a dumb thing to be mad about.", "Cold water takes blood out. Easily.", "I\u2019m not sure why you took my comment as shaming women?", "Then you may be risking ruining clothes. Is what it is.", "Eh. Depends how much exposure he\u2019s had to people periods. I mean, I\u2019m female and *I* freaked out the first time I bled through lol. Thought it was really gross, and I\u2019d been bleeding for several years at that point.\n\nLive, learn, and mature.", "i know but seriously, jeans? you pre-soak then put into the laundry.\ni have a feeling OP ALWAYS does the laundry.\nanyways this is a huge red flag, he isn't boyfriend/husband/father material and should be left high and dry yesterday.\n\nyou bleeding on a chair isnt the same as bleeding on someones clothes. sorry but i dont see the tit for tat here. its his clothes, he can easily wash or not. but to freak out then get her to somehow wash it or try to is creepy.\n\nand trust me when i say that i will clean ANY mess up first, i have kids and selflessly clean up all day for years and years.. but this?", "Only underwear and I can throw that out. In all my 8 years of experience I\u2019ve never leaked once. Maybe that\u2019s just my luck", "You make a mess, you clean it up.  Pretty simple stuff here.\n\nIt\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault, not gross, or anything like that.  But she is responsible to fix any damage caused by her.", "You\u2019re very lucky. In 26 years of my period I have ruined a lot. So liner it is!"]}
