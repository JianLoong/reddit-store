I come back outside after about 10 mins, and as I walk closer to my car, I don\u2019t see my partner and the car seat is empty. I hear a car running and thought it was the one parked next to me. As I continue to walk, I notice it\u2019s actually my car. I go to the driver\u2019s side, and notice the keys are still in the door where I left them. I look over at the passenger seat and my purse is still there wide open, wallet visible. I turn the car off, take a breath, and call my partner. He answers in a very cheery mood and says he took the baby and went for a walk as it was a nice day out. I ask why he didn\u2019t take the kets or my purse or turn the car off at least\u2026his response: no one is going to steal a Sonata.\n\nNow, we were in a strip mall area, during the lunch hour I.e. high foot traffic. He gets in the car and says nothing. But I\u2019m seething. Eventually, I go off and tell him if this was your car and I left the keys in it, car on, wallet visible, you\u2019d have some choice words for me and probably say how was I not thinking! So\u2026what were you thinking? His response: I was thinking that no one would steal this car and I wanted to take our baby on a walk.\n\nMind you, when I saw them finally walking to the car, they were 2 lots away, in a kids\u2019 store. Nowhere in view of the car whatsoever. \n\nThe thoughts that crossed my mind - I would never do this to him. How can he not see the issue?? Car theft and my car is paid off. Would have to file a report and work on getting a new car in this market. How would I get to work? My purse - identity theft and inconvenience. Ok so get an Uber home\u2026we were 20 mins from home and baby wouldn\u2019t have had a car seat. And oh right, no keys so how would we get in the house?\n\nAnd as I\u2019m going off, this is his response\u2026you\u2019re overreacting. No one stole your car. You\u2019re really overthinking this. It\u2019s not like I intentionally left your car unlocked and available - I just thought we should go for a quick walk. Way to ruin the fucking afternoon. Look at how upset you\u2019re getting in front of the baby. You\u2019re seriously overreacting. \n\nI told him to stop talking to me after repeating the recklessness of the situation multiple times on our drive home. And then I started thinking well yea, the car wasn\u2019t stolen, but WHAT IF. \n\nThrough the entire argument home as well as when we got into the house, not once did he apologize. \n\nAITA? Did I overreact? \ud83e\udd14", "created_utc": 1678258542, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lp4tx/aita_for_being_upset_about_my_car_being_left_on/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do not brush this under the rug for the sake of his ego. If he doesn\u2019t learn, your life will continue to suffer for it. \n\nIDK why but this reminds me of a college roommate I briefly had who would leave the front door to our apt (which was exposed to a street) wide open. Every time I\u2019d come home to the door wide open I\u2019d remind her that it was reckless, explain the numerous issues with it, and ask her not to do it again. She\u2019d always dismiss what I said. Then one time our other roommate was changing in the bathroom, and first roommate left the door wide open again when she left for class, and a stranger walked off the street into our apt and let himself into our bathroom where second roommate was buck naked. Thankfully one of her guy friends happened to be over, and when she screamed her friend immediately charged into the bathroom and dragged the stranger out of the apt before anything could happen. I heard about this later that day and it has haunted me ever since. We used the incident to get the reckless roommate kicked out.

F that guy.", "From now on when you leave the car he gets out with the baby, you get your purse and keys and lock the car. He can get back in when you come back as he is irresponsible with your things and he's shown you you can't trust him with them. See how he likes it. NTA", "Yeah, \u201cno one stole it\u201d is pretty clear gaslighting. He was explicitly careless. And **he was careless in a way that was almost guaranteed to cause you anxiety** - getting to your car and finding your baby gone in a way that suggests *something could have happened*. \n\nThis said, being with an infant or toddler can be exhausting and can make people forget things that they would obviously never otherwise do. If he took a walk because the baby was fussy or crying or whatever, **it is possible that the baby\u2019s anxiety fed his own in a way that short circuited his better judgement**. \n\nBut, **If this kind of thing is a pattern with him, then this is a red flag**, especially if he is careless with your things but not his own.

I'm assuming it's not a fob-activated vehicle. The engine was running, so for some reason the door key wasn't on the same ring.
