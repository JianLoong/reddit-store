If he doesn\u2019t learn, your life will continue to suffer for it. \n\nIDK why but this reminds me of a college roommate I briefly had who would leave the front door to our apt (which was exposed to a street) wide open. Every time I\u2019d come home to the door wide open I\u2019d remind her that it was reckless, explain the numerous issues with it, and ask her not to do it again. She\u2019d always dismiss what I said. Then one time our other roommate was changing in the bathroom, and first roommate left the door wide open again when she left for class, and a stranger walked off the street into our apt and let himself into our bathroom where second roommate was buck naked. Thankfully one of her guy friends happened to be over, and when she screamed her friend immediately charged into the bathroom and dragged the stranger out of the apt before anything could happen.

If he took a walk because the baby was fussy or crying or whatever, **it is possible that the baby\u2019s anxiety fed his own in a way that short circuited his better judgement**. \n\nBut, **If this kind of thing is a pattern with him, then this is a red flag**, especially if he is careless with your things but not his own.

Leaving valuables not secured is an easy way to get things stolen. It may not have been the entire car, but your purse, wallet and keys would have been gone and that would have been some effort in making sure credit cards are locked plus you would have to change the locks on your apartment and if you want to avoid stuff like that, you lock the car if you leave it.\n\nI don't blame you for your reaction, especially when he is so careless. If he wants this to blow over, he needs to own up to his mistake and make sure it won't happen again.

If in running in, I will leave them there if my sister is in the car.", "I forget to put the milk in the fridge and leave it on the table. My wife gets upset and I tell her to calm down because sitting on the table for and extra hour isn't going to make make it go bad. Later I defend myself by saying I didn't do it on purpose. \n\n\nThis is not a contradiction or a sign of deliberate milk spoilage. That's just how people talk.", "Gaslighting doesn't just mean lying, and there's no reason to assume he's purposely trying to get their car stolen.", "He said \"I was thinking no one is going to steal the car and we should go for a walk\" and then he said OP is overreacting, and in that scenario, that usually happens because the one making a mistake is downplaying it or not taking any accountability. \n\nI'm pretty sure that an acknowledgement or an apology would have been added to the text if it had been the case and that would have probably also calmed down OP a bunch.\n\nI've also never really met someone who is on deflection mode like OP's husband and then goes on to apologize right after without some cool down period in between. If people get berated, then deflect and continuously get berated because now they haven't just made a mistake but also won't acknowledge it, they don't usually start apologizing or acknowledging their mistakes unless they're trying to calm someone down. But when trying to calm someone down, they don't usually just throw their hands in the air and say stuff like \"you're getting all worked up in front of the baby and you have ruined the afternoon\".\n\nMaybe he said something along the lines of \"let's not discuss this right now\" in an attempt to get OP to stop, but that ain't being accountable for your mistakes either. It could be an indicator that they're aware, but it could also just be a way to try and get OP to shut up. But as it isn't included, I am not willing to give OP's husband the benefit of the doubt, especially with the line about \"I didn't intend to leave the car open and nothing happened\". That's already doubling down after saying that they didn't think anyone WOULD steal the car.", "So if we're not going with the actual definition, what do you think it should mean?", "It may just be a poorly written post. But as written, OP is outside the car when she notices the key still \"in the door.\" That seems really hard (not impossible) to notice if they were in a door pocket. And it's odd that OP parked and left the car running. It was a nice day - maybe she wanted to leave the AC on?\n\nNone of these things are impossible to explain but again... it's oddly written.", "Gaslighting means making someone doubt their reality and making them think they\u2019re crazy and unreasonable. Which is exactly what he\u2019s doing. The fact that op created this thread just to make sure she\u2019s reasonable, is a proof.", "I think that psychologists around the world have a wider definition for gaslighting than what the movie created.\n\nFurther, I think that my trauma therapist absolutely said that things exactly like what this guy did were gaslighting.", "She said she went to the driver's side, but didn't say whether she open3d the door or not. I assumed she had opened it", "Yeah and to be fair? We all gas light or manipulate without even knowing. And they can be such small petty phrases but because anything such gets swept under the rug, you don\u2019t realize why your partner or yourself feels so defensive or snaps at any issue arising \n\nRegardless it\u2019s still gaslighting when they\u2019re making you second guess how you think or feel and he\u2019s being ridiculous"]}
