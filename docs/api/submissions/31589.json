My younger sister has been dreaming with her party since she was eight and I always said I'd pay for any dress she chose. Well, the party is in six months and I took her to try on some dresses, but I was shocked when she choose a tight, low-cut red dress with a big slit. She has a very curvy body and I don't want her to feel bad about developing early, but I thought that dress was inappropriate for her age. I suggested we buy a similar fabric and go to a tailor to make a dress with a smaller cleveage and slit, but she didn't agree. Since then, my sister refuses to talk to me and keeps complaining that I didn't keep my promise. I tried to ask our parents for help, but they didn't want to get involved, saying I had committed to her and needed to face the consequences.

YTA if you do not buy the dress after saying you would. And you would be the bigger asshole if you do buy the dress and then at the party she gets a bunch of negative comments about it and how she looks. I can easily picture busy body uncles and condescending grandmothers saying all kinds of things. \n\nUltimately, I say that even though you will not get out of this unscathed the best choice is to stick to your principles and do what you think is right.", "This isn\u2019t an older sister issue; it is a parent issue. I would tell her you will pay for a dress your parents approve.", "If you promised to pay for any dress she wants and only changed your mind after seeing the dress she chose YTA. To avoid this you could have just told her before you went shopping, something along the lines of \"I know I said any dress, but now that the time is here I want to clarify that there are some guidelines.\"\n\nBut waiting until she actually chose the dress to change your mind is definitely an asshole move", "Without seeing the dress or knowing how conservative your family gatherings are - as pure as your intentions are for wanting to safeguard your sis, YWBTA to gatekeep their choice of dress in this situation. \n\n1) Part of growing up is about getting to celebrate your own identity and autonomy and being able to share who you are with family, and so what people wear is a large part of how they view themselves. You made a promise to your sister to the effect of supporting her in her autonomy, and clearly they've been looking up to more mature women and being viewed as a more mature themselves. They may not be fully aware of the repercussions yet which is a conversation in itself, but it's understandable they're disappointed that you don't see them being grown up enough to express themselves this way yet.\n\n2) You won't always be able to control how they dress and it's probably better that they get to explore that in a safe environment with family first.\n\n3) You won't be able to control other people's behavior. The best way to protect her from aggressive sexual projection is to have grown up conversations about their self worth so that they can recognize and walk away from disrespect - because that situation is never about the dress they're wearing.", "NTA\n\nI agree that it'd be best for you to send her dress shopping with your parents and you will pay for whatever dress she picks with them. \n\nI get your perspective and it makes sense, you're trying to protect your sister. But she is going to resent you if you go back on your word. So buy the dress, but make your parents do the work of approving it.", "NTA, you made that promise in the hopes that your little sister would grow up to be a modest young woman. Sometimes promises have to be broken. She\u2019s 15 if she wants to dress grown she can get a job and pay for it herself like other grown folks.", "Sorry, but I think YTA. You said she could get any dress she wants, and you are the one who is sexualizing her.", "[deleted]", "YTA i think the red dress would make her happy and feel beautiful on the day.", "Hm. What has you concerned, exactly? If it\u2019s like the quincea\u00f1eras in the US, it would be mostly family and friends attending. Are you worried one/some of them would sexualize her? Or are you worried your parents/family will blame you for buying such a revealing dress? \n\nLeaning towards YTA. You agreed to pay for whatever dress she wanted, no stipulations. You can\u2019t put stipulations on it after the fact.", "NTA but your sister wearing that dress is a Canon event. Can't interfere.", "YTA\n\nYou tell her she can have any dress she wants and then say \"no\" when it turns out she doesn't choose a black garbage bag for a dress. \n\nAnd you're not her parent even if you are twice her age. Her *parents* are the ones who get to make that decision.", "YTA. You said you would buy the dress. Buy the dress. If your parents don\u2019t think it is appropriate they can tell her she can\u2019t wear it. If they do think it is appropriate then you may be over thinking it.", "YTA. You just added arbitrary rules because you don't like her choice. As long as your parents are OK with it, you should let it go. Your sister is also a young woman. I'm sure you still see her as a little girl, and it's probably affecting your opinion of the dress. In the end your sister is going to grow up and you're going to see her on clothes you won't agree with but at least you'll have  kept the promise you made her.", "YTA. Simply buy the dress and have it altered to be a bit more modest.  The deep plunge can be stitched up a bit, as can the slit.  The kid will still feel beautiful, and you won't look like a jerk.", "You foolishly made a promise without putting limitations on that promise.  Now your sister wants to dress the role of a night walker and you're caught.  don't make stupid promises until you've thought through the implications.", "You don't want her to be sexualised but by telling her she can't wear that dress because of her body and how it will look, you're sexualising her too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
