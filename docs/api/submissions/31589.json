You made a promise to your sister to the effect of supporting her in her autonomy, and clearly they've been looking up to more mature women and being viewed as a more mature themselves. They may not be fully aware of the repercussions yet which is a conversation in itself, but it's understandable they're disappointed that you don't see them being grown up enough to express themselves this way yet.\n\n2) You won't always be able to control how they dress and it's probably better that they get to explore that in a safe environment with family first.\n\n3) You won't be able to control other people's behavior.

So buy the dress, but make your parents do the work of approving it.", "NTA, you made that promise in the hopes that your little sister would grow up to be a modest young woman.

You just added arbitrary rules because you don't like her choice. As long as your parents are OK with it, you should let it go. Your sister is also a young woman. I'm sure you still see her as a little girl, and it's probably affecting your opinion of the dress.

If the OP took notice it's likely that other people will too. And hopefully the people that do notice don't have bad intentions.\n\n It's not like OP invented cleavage - why are we blaming OP for being concerned about something that is commonly sexualized already?", "This logic is dumb.

I completely uncomfortable what you're saying, but ultimately, they are the parents and its up to them to tell her if it's incapable.", "NTA, although you did say you\u2019d buy the dress you didn\u2019t expect it to be like that. You\u2019re trying to protect your sister from not being sexualized while she\u2019s so young.

People can see her for the beautiful women she is turning into or sexualize her. Personally, anyone that wants to sexualize a 15 yo is a creeper.\n\nShe is proud and confident. Let her get the dress. Then sit back and wait to see how your parents respond. They may end up regretting not getting involved. \n\nEither way, you want your sister to trust you. You do this by keeping your word.", "ntah  you just look out for her  low cut is not appropriate for a 15-year-old your  being  a good big sister", "YTA\n\nIf you had conditions you should have said so before promising to buy a dress. All that you\u2019ve done now is break a promise and try to inflict your own political views on your sisters bodily autonomy. If parents aren\u2019t getting involved then it certainly feels like you are in the wrong. I would expect parents to be parents and school a minor when they are being too much. \n\nAre you actually Brazilian or just your lineage is Brazilian? I ask because every Brazilian I have met and interacted with is very open sexually. Have you been to a beach in Brazil and seen what they wear? I have friends who got breast implants as gifts for their 18th birthdays.. The dress you described seems pretty normal for what I would expect from a Brazilian. However, the way you wrote out the story just makes me feel like you were born and raised in a different country like USA.", "YTA. It\u2019s her choice, consequences included.

You are now in a no win situation.    \n\nAs others have stated.  Best option is to take parents for approval but by the comments it just may be too late as they now don't want to get involved. \n\nGet her the dress.   If there is fall out from her wearing the dress, be the big sister and be there to comfort her.     This party is all about her emerging from child to woman.

OP didn't offer to put her in a sack, she offered to have the same dress made with the same features, just toned down to reflect her sister's age. It was an excellent option, which her sister should have taken, but instead is throwing a stop (which is indicative of her maturity) & only underlines to me that she's a child. And that's not an insult, she's 14, she's supposed to be one.", "I tried on a dress like this recently. Slits are cut so high these days... I'm grown and wouldn't wear a dress like that just because one wrong move and the goodies are on display.", "Lol, no, it's not, bud. Just because she didn't stipulate that her sister had to use some common sense, it doesn't mean she is not allowed to disagree with a ridiculous decision her sister is making. If I lend you my car to go to the shops, I shouldn't have to stipulate that the shop you're driving too isn't 300km away before finding out your true intentions. The expectation is that you're going to be reasonable in your request.", "The time to \"clarify guidelines\" was when the promise was made. Springing conditions on someone after the fact makes you an asshole even if you do it before they have picked something.", "The dress is designed to be sexy. The point of a low cut, high slit dress is to be a sexy dress. You wouldn't put a ten year old in lingerie because it's inherently sexy. \n\nSexualizing the sister would be saying that she can't wear an otherwise \"normal/modest\" dress because it is more formfitting on her or because her breasts are still visible under the fabric.", "That's not at all what they said.

You don\u2019t wear something revealing around family, at church, at a funeral, or in any other formal situation.\n\nWhen it comes to showing skin in a dress as an adult woman (not a child), you either pick between a *tasteful* slit or a slightly lower cut.
