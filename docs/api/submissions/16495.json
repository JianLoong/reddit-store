Did you ask her how she would feel if you were to quickly open the shower curtains while she's taking a shower to take a quick shot of **her** in the nude against **her** wishes?", "NTA and I'd be rethinking your relationship if you need to go to that extreme because she won't respect your boundaries.", "NTA, she shouldn't have taken a nude photo of you if you weren't okay with it.", "NTA but rethink your relationship.  Do you really want to give her another opportunity to do it again, only this time she might silence the shutter sound and  you have less of a chance of knowing it's happening?", "NTA, nudes are only sexy with consent", "NTA what girlfriend did was actually a criminal act.. you aren\u2019t allowed to take pictures of someone nude or during a sexual activity without their permission. Him strong arming her to erase the picture was an unfortunate circumstance of her taking a picture that wasn\u2019t consented to by op. If this was reversed and op did this to his girlfriend everyone with the Yta\u2019s would be ready to string dude up by his male member (don\u2019t wanna get banned\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude02) double standards", "NTA... Your girlfriend needs to learn to respect consent. \n\nI get people may feel uneasy about pinning, but imo that depends on the relationship context. \n\nMy husband and I occasionally roughhouse and I'm never afraid even if I lose. But if she was genuinely afraid, you may need to renegotiate boundaries around play fighting. (She told you to come and get it, which reads as play oriented brat behavior. But again, it depends on what is normal in your relationship.)", "NTA. It is NEVER ok to take a nude pic without that person\u2019s agreement.", "Nope, she didn't have your consent to take or keep the photo and taunted you to come and delete it. So you did. She should have just deleted it when you asked.\n\nOr, if the deal was that it's either both of you who gets the pics or neither, then she can let you take those pictures of her too.", "NTA, and I also sincerely recommend you get the heck out of that relationship ASAP. If someone I was dating had no respect for my boundaries, that wasn't just a red flag, that was an instant deal-breaker.", "NTA.\n\nOnly part I\u2019d think OP could have done differently is that he physically overpowered gf, but I think men or physically larger people also have right to defend themselves if someone took non-consented nude photo and refused to delete it and provoked (come and get it). I don\u2019t read from the post that gf got upset because she was hurt or scared, so reason she\u2019s mad is just that her phone got taken, to me. OP didn\u2019t go through anything expect just deleted one nude photo.\n\n\nIt\u2019s irrelevant that OP shared nude photos with past partners. And OP\u2019s reason (unless it\u2019s mutual, no sharing) doesn\u2019t matter.\nOP doesn\u2019t want this gf to have nude photo of him, period.", "NTA and taking a nude photo of me without my consent would be a dump-able offense for me.", "NTA. Why are you with this woman? She takes non-consensual photos of your naked body and then refuses to delete them. That's fucked.", "NTA. Taking a nude without consent is messed up, and doubling down just makes it worse.", "She did not have your consent to keep a naked photo. She fought to keep it. She very aggressively fought to keep it.\n\nTo me personally, that just screams she wants it  for ulterior motives like black mail or have something over you, or pretend she saw you sending it to another girl... SOMETHING. Because no rational person just wants to keep a photo just for the sake of it. Your concerns and feelings should have mattered more than her entitlement to keep the photo.", "NTA\n\nBut seriously you shouldn\u2019t stay in a relationship with her. She violated your consent and then got *angry* when you tried to say no. This red flags are on *fire*.", "Let's reverse this a bit. A woman is getting into a shower, and her boyfriend takes a nude picture of her. She demands he delete it, but he refuses because he wants it. What would the reaction be to that? Your girlfriend crossed a big line. It's not great that you pinned her down like that. But she had no right to that photo. I'd be reviewing the relationship.

Period. \n\nThat said there are so many red flags in this. \n\n1. Don\u2019t talk about previous relationships, that\u2019s the past and it\u2019s irrelevant and none of her business what you did with your ex. \n\n2. Saying that she can\u2019t have any of you if she won\u2019t give any of herself feels really manipulative. You don\u2019t actually mind giving nudes, so you are using it as a bartering chip to get nudes of someone else. It\u2019s a weird boundary\u2026 and your reasoning seems off to me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you never owe *anyone* nudes of you, for any reason, just be sure your not trying to manipulate people to get what you want from them. Cus yuck. \n\n3. If the person you\u2019re dating refuses to respect your boundary (taking the pic without consent), uses your past against you (you did it with your ex), and then mocks and goads you (come and get it) then that person is toxic and your next step is to say to them \u201cif you don\u2019t delete it right now and show me that it\u2019s permanently removed from your recently deleted folder, I\u2019ll be going to the police because you just broke the law.\u201d Then once they\u2019ve done it, *dump them*.

But you using physical force is bad - you didn't just snatch the phone, you *physically restrained her*. \n\nI know we've just seen one brief glimpse of your relationship, but you two sound super toxic together.", "ESH.

As am i getting undressed i hear a click, i turned around and my girlfriend is getting a picture of me almost butt naked from behind. Know that I think about it, it wasn't that bad because only my butt and some legs were showing but i got mad because i don't like to share this types of photos with any girlfriend i had in the past, that wasn't willing to do the same, she never liked me, having photos of her so i told her early in the relationship that if that's the case i don't want her to have photos of me.(Some clarification here when I say photo i mean nudes).\n\nI turn around and tell her to delete that now and she was like \"no I want to have one for me\".\nI tell her no you are not so give the phone so i can delete the photo or i would take it by force. She was being stubborn and telling me, that \"your ex and you had nudes of each other on your phones\" and she wants to have one for her. I again told her no because she never let me have one of her and i have respected that through out our relationship and what i was doing with my ex in the past was my business. After that she basically told me \"if you can come and get it\" so i did.\n\nI pinned her down on the bed, her arms underneath my knees and the rest of my weight on her. She couldn't move at all so i took the phone deleted the picture.\n\nShe got very mad after that and wanted to kick me out of the house but i told her that she can do that when she pays for everything she locked her self in the other room but after an hour we made it up and we both said sorry, but i still want to know how much of a botthole i am so common Reddit give me my score.\n\nTldr:My girlfriend took a picture of me naked i got mad took her phone deleted my picture and she got mad.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She shouldn\u2019t have goaded you into taking the phone if she didn\u2019t want you to take the phone. I\u2019m not seeing the thought process with the ESH or YTA comments. Y\u2019all would rather see a man sexually assaulted (and yes, that\u2019s what it is, because if he took nude pictures of her and refused to delete them after she expressed discomfort, you would be calling him a predator) than to see a woman be\u2026 *checks notes* pinned down while taking absolutely 0 damage to anything but her pride?", "NTA.

I'm not a fan of how you went about deleting the photo, because I'm against physical force against another, but I understand why you did it.

Desperate times, desperate measures and its not like he socked her in the face.", "I agree with all but number 2. \nI have the same rule in all my relationships, if it's not okay for me it's not okay for you, and vise versa. It's not a manipulation tactic it's a base line. She's okay with His nudes existing, but not Hers, why? Whats good for the goose is good for the gander.

It's fucking terrifying to be pinned down, especially by someone that claims to love you. I'll take the downvotes, but physical aggression should not have been the first step here, and it's not okay.", "Well then is it not unfair to him to put the \"OP could have\" comment? He is in a rock and a hard place situation either ends in that nude still existing (bad) or using the minimum amount of force to delete the picture. There shouldn't be any blame on him because he chose the lesser of two evils", "So he's an AH for protecting his naked body?\nBad take.", ">I turn around and tell her to delete that now \n\nFunny. He did talk to her. She then refused. Why did you purposely ignore this part of the post? I don't need an answer because I already know. You ignore parts of the story that show the man communicating because by ignoring it, you can put partial blame on him and twist the story to suit your agenda. Shame on you", "I dont have an agenda. He communicated, she responded badly. But she wasn't physically attacking him, and he DID physically attack her. You don't think there's more that could have been said before resorting to violence?"]}
