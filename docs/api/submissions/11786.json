I have a Netflix account that I fully pay for. One of my closest friends is in a tight financial situation and I gave her full access to my account to use as she pleases.

I didn't wanna be an asshole so I hung up to compose myself. Then I decided to change my password and sign out all devices currently logged in. AITA for doing this?

When I am doing a favor, once you over reach you are not entitled to any other favors from me.", "NTA \nIn fact I \u2018borrow\u2019 an account to. I\u2019d never do that. There\u2019s a limit on how many devices can access it at one time so yeah you could potentially find yourself not being able to watch Netflix yourself. \n\nAlso I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a 7 day trial they could have accessed. And just curious, are they both poor as a couple that they can\u2019t afford an account between them?\n\nOne thing to consider tho, she was wrong and you were right, BUT she could have not told you and gotten away with it. I\u2019m just throwing this out there - in case you\u2019re evaluating your friendship", "NTA. It's yours. But I would advise learning how to communicate those boundaries before acting :)", "NTA and the more locations you use, the more money it costs you. I\u2019d change the password and tell her, her boyfriend can stump up the costs if she can\u2019t afford too. She was out of line doing that when you were only trying to help her out.", "NTA\n\nShe didnt ask.", "Netflix working on banning people that use accounts not in the same household.  This kind of stuff will start showing up on your bill eventually ... NTA", "I don't really understand why it makes you angry if you'd be fine with it if she asked first.\n\nThat being said I don't think you're an asshole for having feelings about it, even if I don't understand.", "Asking forgiveness is easier than asking permission. I suspect she gave it away in a moment without thought. \"Oh you have to see X. You don't have Netflix? Here's my login. Let me know what you think?\"\nFair chance she really didn't understand harm. After all, you shared. But Netflix tighting rules has been in press and may have led to understanding and confession.\n\nSo hard one to call. Probably NAH. Your account, your choices and she did share without permission. But can see how it could happen and be bad thing to break a friendship over if only issue.", "NTA She didn\u2019t ask. I really can\u2019t stand people who do something & then ask if it was okay after the fact. If she really cared she would\u2019ve ask how you felt about it before doing it.", "Doing it immediately was smart because OP was able to change their password on their account before their friend/partner could change the password for them and lock them out. So much faster and easier than having to deal with customer service to prove your identity that it\u2019s your account. \n\nMany individual accounts only allow two devices to stream at once. If her partner has the password and wants to watch a movie together with OP\u2019s friend, that essentially prevents OP from having access to watch Netflix when they want, on their own account that they pay for. \n\nShe should have asked permission first, but I think that she got the hint when OP hung up on her. NTA", "NTA. You were already doing her a favour, what she did was rude.", "ESH. She violated your trust, and you were right to take it away, BUT you should have been direct. Hanging up and booting them out was kind of passive aggressive.", "NTA. It is your account. You are the one paying for it, so you can decide who has access. Additionally, you did your friend a favor. The least she could do is communicate.", "NTA.  I don't know why you shared it to begin with.", "NTA you pay 100% of the bill, you get to decide who has access to it.  She gave it away without asking.", "ESH. You could\u2019ve used your words and told her \u2018I\u2019m not cool with this, I\u2019m changing my password\u2019 instead of pretending things were ok.\n\nBut either way, you were not \u2018being selfish\u2019 - that falls on her, not you.", "NTA. She gave away your account info without even asking you, which is not cool. You were OK for her to use the account because of her circumstances, it doesn't mean she can share it with others.", "YTA - She asked if you were mad and you didn't communicate your feelings.  You could have texted her after composing yourself and said... 'Hey friend.  In answer to your question if I am mad, the answer is 'yes', I'm very mad.  It was disrespectful of you to share my account with your boyfriend.  Please have him log out immediately.'", "ESH - this was a time to say \"I'm not cool with sharing this with you any longer.\" By just changing the login info you're  conveying the same message, but in a way that implies you're not willing to face your friend.", "I think taking time to compose your thoughts is an excellent thing to do in life. That said, esh. She should've asked, and it's your right to make it private. But instead of talking with this friend, stating a boundary had been crossed you hung up and kicked her off. Still your right by all means but not how i would have handled things. If I was the friend after being hung up on then seeing I was kicked off Netflix, I'd be wondering if we are still friends tbh. I'd be freaking out that I ruined a friendship. \n\nJust to reclarify. She did wrong. It's your account and still your right to switch things up.", "Definite NTA. I did the same. Gave it to a friend, she shared the password, I went to watch after work and couldn't because it was already playing on too many devices.\n\nChanged the password and kicked them off right then and sent a salty message about stopping me watching a service *I* pay for", "NTA. It's your account.. she should of ASKED BEFORE sharing it. \n\n And even then if she is watching stuff of her tv she could save the log in info and boom anytime he is there he could long in.", "NTA the fact she is sharing an account t that isn't hers says it all. You don't know this person, how do you know they won't be sharing your information with people you don't know? You did the right thing and don't let her back on, that's awful.", "NTA.\n\nThis is your account and wasn't hers to share credentials with anyone. You don't know this person or what type of device they are signing in on. What if that device is compromised, those credentials could be released on the web then. You did the right thing to sign out of all devices.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I mean, in an ideal world, you\u2019d have told her it bothered you. But it\u2019s not an ideal world and she FAFO.", "NTA. Your consent was needed.", "I'm going ESH ONLY because you didn't talk to said friend about the violation of a boundary. Taking time for composure is something i ALWAYS recommend, but definitely always have a discussion. \n\n You did, however, have every right to rescind permissions, and with the lack of respect this friend showed by not asking, I don't blame you for doing so.", "ESH she should not have shared the account without talking to you first, but *without communicating* changing the password and signing her out is petty and childish. You are old enough to tell her why you are upset and that you don't feel comfortable with her sharing your account if she is going to give the password away without telling you without blowing up your friendship. She was inconsiderate and thoughtless, you are being malicious.", "NTA. This is a great example of the problem with password sharing. People think once it is shared with them they are free to share with others. She was out of line and cutting off access was reasonable.", "NTA. \n\nIt's your account. It was very presumptuous for her to share **your account** without consulting you first. \n\nYou did exactly what I would do.", "NTA. My parents have my Netflix and on the rare occasions where they\u2019re both watching, but a different show on different TVs, I\u2019ve been locked out of my own account.  Also-Netflix is cracking down on this all together, it won\u2019t be long before they are forced to get their own anyway.", "NTA If your friend gave your Netflix password away without asking you first who else was she going to give it to without your permission? And who's to say that this boyfriend won't give it to someone else? You did the right thing. Keep the new password to yourself and don't share with anyone else not even your best friend.", "NTA but hanging up and immediately changing password is pretty immature. Sounds like you just did that because you were pissed, not taking time to \u201ccompose\u201d yourself. Be honest", "I thought Netflix stopped account sharing.", "NTA", "NTA she shared your password and account without your consent. Let her partner and her create an account to share together.", "You were doing her a favor and she decided that gave her permission to help herself.  Some people are like that and now you know she is one of them.  You did the reasonable thing but you really should speak to her and explain that what she did with your account was presumptuous so she should ask her boyfriend to open an account for the two if them.", "NTA. You pay for it. You can decide who you share that account with. They proved with their actions they can't be trusted with your Netflix account. You did the right thing.", "NTA. It's pretty obnoxious to take a kind gesture and assume that means you can treat it exactly like it's yours and then give the password to whoever else you want to. All she had to do was ask, but she decided to do it without asking your permission.", "Yeah - surely between her and her gf they can afford a basic account.", "The old adage of \"ask for forgiveness not consent\" shouldn't always be followed", "I hung up because I prefer tasting my words before saying them. I didn't wanna be hurtful in the heat of the moment. But I see your point. Thank you.", "Yeah, I could have handled the situation better and communicated my feelings. Thank you for your judgment, I'll try to rectify what I did.", "Yeah, you're right. I just dislike confrontation and I ended the call because I like to think before I speak. I did not wanna say anything hurtful in the heat of the moment.", "I think hanging up was an overstatement. Not like I slammed the phone on her, I just kinda rushed the conversation and said bye.", "But thank you so much for your opinion. I see your point", "Yep, I don't know her girlfriend at all. And they've been online dating a few years now. Mind you when I mentioned an online FRIEND I made, she literally pushed me to share their facebook. Off topic but yeah. Thank you so much for your judgment.", "PS. Obviously I did not share said facebook cos I respect privacy \ud83d\ude43", "As a cybersecurity professional I cannot upvote this enough.  \nUsing this opportunity as a PSA that using phrases as a password is much much stronger than a normal password", "That was my first thought. Please go around and change your passwords asap.\n\nAlso NTA. The nerve.", "I know right, who here does not share their Netflix account with friends or family? OP can take away access but I don\u2019t understand her reacting this way nor the people cheering on blowing up the friendship. Just tell the friend that and ask her to remove the device. Give her a chance and then remove the device yourself if she doesn\u2019t. It shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. Not everyone has the same boundaries and I wouldn\u2019t care but respect that some people do and would just ask first. \u201cAs she pleases\u201d might have been interpreted to \u201cuse on boyfriend\u2019s tv to watch movies with him.\u201d\nOP needs to use her words. If they are young I hope it\u2019s a learning experience.", "No, at least not in my country.", "Thank you so much. I would seriously have been MORE than okay with both of them using it had she asked. Hell she could have even just informed me.", "You would think so, and if they can\u2019t, they do without.", "Totally, I get that, and that's a good strategy - but you should've called back and laid down the boundary directly.", "I don't think you're the AH here. This is on your friend. She placed you in a situation of either having a confrontation or just complying with her wants.\n\nIt's not ideal to do what you did as it will have an effect on your friendship but it's not unreasonable either. \n\nNTA", "I just learned this recently, are there any bonus points for like non english or is length the only thing that really matters in delaying a hack?", "They will be soon then. I understand it's a policy they're rolling out worldwide.", "Where's that", "She did inform you, you told her it was OK then after you put the phone down you kicked them both out.  Seems a bit of an over-reaction to me.", "I agree so much. I am just so terrified of confrontation. Cue back to my therapist last week teaching me to set boundaries and feeling comfortable doing so. This would have been a wonderful opporunity to apply that.", "now is your opportunity to practice this. Call her up and tell her you've changed the password and are no longer comfortable sharing it with her because she didn't bother to ask before sharing something that didn't belong to her in the first place."]}
