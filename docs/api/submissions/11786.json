NTA.", "NTA, it's your account that you pay for.  You're not paying for other people to use and share it with their friends until you can't even watch something when you want to.", "NTA. She should of asked. She thinks it\u2019s her account since she gave out the pw. Who knows who she will give it to next. Plus you\u2019re sharing to help her financially, not her bf.", "NTA but if something this simple makes you livid you have bigger problems lol.", "NTA but if she is a good friend of yours you could let her boyfriend to use it. As long as they don\u2019t share it with anyone else", "NTA, she should've asked before doing it", "NTA. I once lent a friend a copy of a game I owned on CD, plus an expansion. She lent it to her then BF so he could play too without asking me. They broke up and I never saw the game or expansion again, nor any form of apology or monetary recompense. Kept the friend for a few years more, but any closeness we had started fading right then. Don't do it if they act like they own it personally. Not worth it.", "NTA. No one should share a password that they have been given as a favor. That is just greedy and rude.\n\nAs others have noted, Netflix is going to limit password sharing. They have already done so in some countries including Canada most recently. I mention Canada because it means that Netflix is gong to start in the USA and other relatively affluent markets as soon as they see what happens in Canada. \n\nAlso you do pay to have multiple people. I live alone so I have the basic plan which is one device at a time since that is all I need. If I wanted to have a plan that enabled multiple devices to stream simultaneously, it would cost me an additional $5.00 per month. Obviously it is worth it if you have multiple family members in your house but makes no sense for a single person to pay extra to gift their friends \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nShe didn't ask. Perfect case of FAFO. You're good.", "NTA", "NTA. Pretty much the same situation happened to my son a couple years ago- gave permission and password to a friend, who gave the info to their parents and also shared with their long-distance boyfriend and he gave the info to his parents. We went to get on and watch something but couldn't because they all were on. He immediately signed them all out and changed the password. Told friend since they shared without permission to so many people he was rescinding his permission.", "NTA - As they say, it\u2019s better to ask permission than beg forgiveness.", "NTA", "NTA but but you're not being completely honest. You did not give her access to your account to \"use as she pleases.\" You gave it to her because you thought she would be sensible and discrete. If her partner needed Netflix, then they should purchase a subscription.", "My ex-husband is still letting me use his Netflix account, but I expect my access to vanish any day with the crack down Netflix is doing.", "NTA - this is why I always check who logged in when I get a notification of a new log in on my account.       \nYou let your friend use it not her new relationship.      It was extremely rude of her to give it to someone else without asking.      \nI personally think it\u2019s actually rude of her to ask as well.       \nDo not give her the password again she\u2019ll only give it out again.      \nHow many people will she end up giving it to ?", "NTA. If you feel bad, you can always tell her the new one later, if she promises to keep it secret. If you don't feel bad, you're still not TA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nNetflix are cracking down on the sharing of passwords. You could fly under the radar with just your friend using your account,  but her boyfriend too, plus whoever else he decides to share it with, you might end up getting into trouble and losing your Netflix account all together.", "First of all, Netflix isn't that expensive, but if it is too expensive for her.  Then she needs to be working and educating herself for a better job.   Why doesn't her guy already have an account and he share his password with her?   So she is broke and dating someone else who is broke and acting like you owe both of them entertainment when they should be working. \n\nShe betrayed your trust and now acts all entitled, she isn't much of a friend as much as she is a mooch.  And if this is what ends the friendship, then it allows you to go and make better friends with other people in this world. \n\nNTA", "NTA. She now has someone she can split the cost with. It wasn\u2019t her information to share.", "Esh, but only because you didn\u2019t tell her when you had the chance.", "NTA.", "NTA... you did not extend permission to anyone else and she should have asked first.", "NTA, especially Netflix trying their damndest to charge account holders extra for extra screens to be playing", "Actually not petty because she shared your information without your consent. Definitely NTA.", "It's the audacity for me. Yeah, I shared your Netflix account information that you pay for entirely with my SO without your permission. Are you mad? In what quadrant of space would anyone be happy with this situation? I don't even like it when someone shares my phone number. Nowhere  near TA.", "Nta\n You aren't selfish for not allowing people on your account, you pay for. Sharing with someone does not give them the right to give it to anyone else without permission from you FIRST.", "NTA, my own sister, tried doing this, and I told her no. She got mad and didn't see the big deal. This was when you could order DVDs, too, and her friend went in, changed the address, and ordered DVDs to rent. Luckily, they sent them back, and I wasn't charged for DVDs not being returned.", "NTA.  Netflix is cracking down on this and they will need their own accounts soon anyways.  Devices will need to \"check in\" at your primary location soon or they will be blocked.\n\n\"To ensure uninterrupted access to Netflix, connect to the Wi-Fi at your primary location, open the Netflix app or website, and watch something at least once every 31 days. This creates a trusted device so you can watch Netflix, even when you\u2019re away from your primary location.\r  \n\r  \nIf you are away from your primary location for an extended period of time, your device may be blocked from watching Netflix. You can request a temporary access code to continue watching.\"\n\nPlus there is a 720P $7/month with ads option now they can get for themselves.", "NTA, and I *think* that if the two of them were watching something at the same time and you tried to watch something, you would have been blocked from doing so. This is based on one experience when my mom and niece were watching from two different locations and I tried to log in and couldn't view anything. Besides that, I believe Netflix is cracking down on password sharing.", "Info: if they wanted to watch Netflix together why couldn't her BF pay for it and share the account with her? It's not on you to pay for your friend's BF.", "For sure NTA \n\nYou only get so many shares and they shared it with a hookup. The end. I shared my HBO password once and that person gave it to their sister in law. I signed out of all accounts within the hour.", "NTA my big hang up is that she has no idea what else you use that password for. You\u2019re not supposed to reuse passwords cuz security but almost everyone does. For all she knows she also just gave him access to your email and bank information.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t hers to give and now you know she can\u2019t be trusted. If she asks tell her that!", "nta", "Yeah it's just plain disrespectful. It's *your* personal password that she shared with mouth your permission. \n\nAnd they're just online dating? That makes it even sketchier to me.", "Tell your friend she should've gotten Discord and screen-shared from there. That's what I do, I don't give out mine or other people's passwords. If she really wants to watch movies with her boyfriend, she could do that AND talk in a voice channel at the same time. And Discord is free", "She did kind of just inform you, though lol,so......", "I have done this several times, giving away my brother's and parent's Netflix accounts. I have definitely accepted it when they changed the passwords! NTA, it's your account, you are free to do with it whar you want", "Yeah so now your friends BF has your email/password combo to everything, should they go try to login with it wherever.\n\nHopefully you have a password manager so you know where you use that password and it's variants across multiple sites, so you can go change it...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor anyone that is ever thinking about sharing their password, even with their friends: Make sure you change it to something unique before you share it, and assume that it is no longer secure once you do.", "I think it's time to change that password.", "I share my Amazon, Hulu, and Disney Plus login with multiple people and I make sure that the password for those is unique. My friends have teased me bc the PWs for those is something like ChickenTender69! but I need it to memorable haha", "I reuse a ton of passwords, but the passwords for my streaming accounts are only for my streaming accounts so that I avoid the specific problem", "That\u2019s a disaster waiting to happen.", "I believe the problem here is she did it after the fact. One of those \"ask forgiveness instead of permission.\"", "That\u2019s what I thought too.", "I appreciate your commitment to being part of the problem instead of part of the solution. \ud83e\udee1", "Does it matter if you reuse the same password for everything that is unimportant? Like throwaway accounts for free trials & such. What if you also have no money and a shit credit score so you really aren\u2019t a great identity to steal? Asking for a friend", "If someone's a very close friend though you'd hope to be able to trust them with that info anyway. Just seems like common decency to ask your friend who owns the account first if they're alright with another person using it as well.", "is your Amazon Prime Video account linked to your main Amazon account with a stored credit card?  If so I would look into securing that.  I'm sure there is a way to decouple those two things.", "Not in Canada they didn't.  We now have to register our home network with Netflix and pay $8 a month for add on users (ie, not home network users).", "they've slowed their role but they are still working on plans to crack down on password sharing--just not going to use the method they're using in other markets", "They\u2019re still rolling it out. They are doing it in Canada now. The US is next.", "I live in Portugal and they didn't backpedal here, even thought lots of people cancelled their accounts (me included). We have restrictions on how account sharing can be done and we need to pay for \"extra members\". It's ridiculous, especially when Netflix is the most expensive streaming service atm in the country, even Disney+ is cheaper.", "Thank you! Idk how I missed this but I did. I have a 19 year old daughter who doesn't live at home so she's broke af. I didn't want to have to kick her off our Netflix bc it's like one of the only things she can enjoy. We likely would have just gotten her her own account but I wasn't too pleased about having to give the bastards more money.", "That would\u2019ve been a nightmare had it gone through\u2026", "People are getting caught up with the fact she asked after the fact. That's not really any different than saying hey I gave it away. Neither required OP permission,they got to the same place, why are they mad about the directions getting there if it is the same result? I'd be more pissed if they just casually said they gave it away instead of asking even after the fact. One at least shows some semblance of awareness.", "Does the account have your personal information like your name, date of birth, address or financial information? Personal information is gold to malicious actors", "No, this is not true. My Netflix password is less important than my banking password, and my friends Disney + password is as important as my Netflix password. I won't keep my friends password as secret as my backing password. After all, my friend already shared it - with me.\nAlso, on average, your friend is al likely to be hacked as you are, so you doubled the risk by giving it out.", "Of course the friend should have had the decency to ask first.  \n\nThis is my exact point.  It is improper to have a situation where a friend could even have the ability do this in the first place.", "Yeah, I actually have had only 1 person ever use my CC on Amazon video to rent a movie. I couldn\u2019t track exactly who it was but I had my suspicions so I kicked that person just to make sure. I also added a PIN so people can\u2019t buy movies with my card anymore.", "They have implemented it in Canada, with a \"date\" to set your primary location etc.... Except i didn't, and it still entirely works! (My mom uses it, and it's still working for her!)", "Im in Canada I think they stopped doing that. I'm a leech and I haven't got the warning again. Only lasted a couple days.", "Yeah, the minute they pull it, I'm cancelling. I pay for 4 screens, I want to be able to use those as I please with family who's moved out or even myself when I'm travelling or visiting other places.\n\nI think they'll have a harder time implementing it in the US, but likely will eventually, to some degree.", "That's ridiculous.  You pay for the number of screens that can be using the service at the same time.  It shouldn't matter whether the screens are in the same place.  They're paid for regardless.", "> Also, on average, your friend is al likely to be hacked as you are, so you doubled the risk by giving it out.\n\nThis is admittedly a fair point I hadn't really considered. And would also agree with the general rule that it's probably best to ensure your top priority passwords are different from ones you use for banking.", "Their plan did have an ability to use it in multiple houses -- like with winter/summer homes, vacation travel and mobile devices.  And they also are proposing that for a family member that moves out, you can add them for a low fee (like five bucks).  They just don't want relationships like the OP to continue.", "I agree. That's why I finally cancelled my Netflix service.", "Most of my family split up and went their own ways, so I'd end up paying that $5 fee often. Just not really worth it. It's great for the 3 parties that get to use it now, but if they want to make it so only my house can use it without fees - I'd rather just cancel and use other services. Great if it works for others, but doesn't really fit my current uses with their plans.", "NTA. My best friend's mom asked to use my Paramount. I agreed. My best friend asked me herself if she could also use it and she's my friend.", "NTA she took the p*ss could have at least asked first . Also aren\u2019t Netflix cracking down on account sharing anyway? If so, she\u2019s put your account at risk", "NTA. What's to stop the boyfriend, that you don't even know, from sharing it with even more people \ud83d\ude44 that you don't know. Pretty casual of your friend to be so generous with your account!", "NTA, when people ask for an inch and take a mile, you take that inch away!", "NTA. Really do hate when people do this. If you aren't paying for it, you have no right to give out the password.", "My ex did this. He went to his parents house and signed them in to my Netflix, HBO Max, and Prime. We hadn\u2019t even been dating that long! A week later, due to unrelated issues, I ended things, and I totally changed my passwords and signed out all devices. His mom called him and complained and he was mad at ME! \n\nGeeze. Pay for your own streaming! This single mom isn\u2019t supporting all of y\u2019all! \n\nNTA", "NTA.  We know a couple who let their sons use their Netflix account while they were away at college. They changed the password last year when they found 38(!) separate people logged on using their account.\n\nOnce you give that info away, you're at the mercy of the least-scrupulous person who gets it.", "NTA.  You will soon be paying extra for others to use your account.", "NTA. I\u2019m logged into a streaming service one of my ex\u2019s pays for, and I don\u2019t know the password or even his email honestly but even if I did, I cannot imagine sharing that info with someone.", "NTA. It's you're account and you pay for it. You can do whatever you wish with it. Besides, Netflix is cracking down on account sharing anyways. She would have eventually lost it either way.", "NTA.  Your friend is.\n\nShe didn't even ask first.\n\nDon't worry tho, NetFlix is eventually fixing the password sharing issue   By you taking control before this happens, you'll be in better shape than most.", "NTA. The login/pw is yours. It's not your friends to share without your permission. Plus she should honestly be more considerate given Netflix might penalize you if discovered. If that were to happen, you're the only one who faces penalty while nothing happens to your friend or her BF.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nyou don't give out **anyone's** private password or information, without permission. Keep it shut down.", "And this is probably part of the reason why Netflix keeps saying that they want to crack down on this behavior. \n\nI get sharing an account within a household, but then give it to a friend who WITHOUT permission decides that it is okay to give it to another friend. Just rude.", "I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019ve done something similar. Except I logged in on someone else\u2019s device (technically I didn\u2019t give them the password)", "NTA- your friend is for dating someone that can't afford a $15 a month Netflix subscription!", "NTA I once had an ex get pissed I changed my password when he hadn\u2019t paid toward any of the streaming services when we broke up. He texted me that I \u201cmust hate him\u201d. He was 26 I was 21", "Nta and not her call to make.", "NTA. She is.", "NTA.\n\nRespect is great, when it's used appropriately. It's no longer respect if it's after the fact.\n\nYour account, your bill, your rules.", "Then you deserve whatever happens to any of your accounts. This is so goddamn stupid, honestly to god.", "Ooh.  That's asking for trouble.  \n\nI use an Apple product that makes it very easy to generate and save password in an iCloud account.  I know there are other apps out there to generate a REALLY strong password then be able to find that password later.", "Another avenue of passive anger taken from us.  When will this end?!   /s", "Ooh. Good to know. Thx!", "Ooh. Good to know. Thx! Not that I\u2019m doing that, of course . . . .", "God.  Some people are just so bored they go out of their way to be dicks.  Good for you man!", "I hope not! I travel and use Netflix other places, and so do my kids because their dad and I are divorced. It would make no sense to have to pay extra for them to use Netflix somewhere else!", "i more meant getting into your Amazon shopping account any buying...anything...  But yeah that too.", "Has it been a full month since that date yet? I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s going to self-destruct a month in since they claimed you could use Netflix in different locations \u201cas long as that device logged in on your home network within the last month\u201d\u2014like maybe that gave everybody a 1mo grace period on it.", "Amazon tracks which cards are used to buy things to which addresses. They\u2019d have to retype in the card number.", "It was 8$ per month on the email we got (CAD) per additional user up to 2, but only on the premium plan. So it would be 37/month to use in 3 seperate households. When the premium plan is already paying for 4 screens.", "It only works for me if we can have it at our winter/summer place and on my ipad at the gym.  Otherwise, well, we have other options.", "Wow.  That gets expensive.  It's about $20 US now and I have a daughter and a niece on my plan.  They are both aware that they will have to have their own plans in the future."]}
