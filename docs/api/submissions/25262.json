It can also transfer fungal infections, among other things, so gross.\n\nI don't use douche, but I bought some just for the box. I put all of my razors and the extra blades in there, because I knew he'd never check a douche box for a razor.

I\u2019ve stated that I believe that OP\u2019s brother is wrong to have used her soaps. Since the post didn\u2019t say if OPs brother was aware of the location, I stated that he could have asked, reimbursed, and then apologized about his behavior. I provided a reason for the public embarrassment being bad.  I provided other potential solutions to the issue.\n\nI believe I stated that I understood why she did what she did.\n\nCould someone please explain the down votes.

Bc she makes it very clear that her brother won't steal her bodywash bc he doesn't want to smell like a girl, so *he's* the one who thinks \"feminine\" scsnts are emasculating. OP's just using his own opinion against him. \n\n>Especially when the super-easy solution here would be 'don't leave your shampoo and soap in the bathroom for everybody to use.'\n\nAh, yes, it makes total sense for OP to have to repeatedly take out and put back all her shower products every day just bc her brother can't respect her things. Just bc it's in the bathroom they share doesn't mean the things she gets for herself are for \"everybody to use.\" If the brother was using her toothbrush or towel, would you say the same thing?", "> Ah, yes, it makes total sense for OP to have to repeatedly take out and put back all her shower products every day just bc her brother can't respect her things.\n\nIt does make total sense. It's why there's things like 'shower caddies.'\n\nIf brother won't respect her things, it's her decision to a) start waging a war, or b) just keep her things to herself.\n\nWe don't live in a perfect world where people 'should' do things.

Maybe the brother would just come take it out of her room. Maybe she isn't able to lock her room to keep him out of it.\n\n>I 'should' be able to walk down any street in any city loudly singing about how happy I am that I'm carrying a giant sack full of hundred dollar bills, and swinging said sack merrily to and fro.\n\nI don't know how you think announcing yourself carrying money to a bunch of strangers is comparable to expecting your brother to not use the shampoo you paid for. You realize there's a complete difference in level of trust between an older brother and random ppl you meet in public, right?", "NTA...
