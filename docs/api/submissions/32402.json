Sure, she may have expected a \"what happens on the trip stays on the trip\" attitude, but unless that was clearly stated up front with an opportunity for people to back out cost free, then she needs to accept the outcome of her actions.

It wasn't really your business and now you're the baddie for nothing.", "ESH Emily is the worst for sure.

It's a very hurtful situation and none of you cared how this info reaches the guy or for the fact that he'll feel worse that everybody, including the girls and all the guys knew before him. You caused him unnecessary extra pain.\nObviously the cheating girl is the biggest a hole and her friends follow next. \n\nAll this being said, be sure that if the roles were reversed, none of the guys would tell their gfs your bf is cheating, just food for thought.", "No. NTA and you need to stay far away from these losers. \n\nIts not your fault that Emily was cheating - that is all on Emily.

OP's boyfriend is also in the wrong in airing it out so publicly.\n\nAt the end of the day, all of this shit is really between Emily and her boyfriend and what their relationship is like.

It's honestly beyond the pale; I think you might be insane.", "honestly i don't even think it's really AH behavior to get drunk and gossip about someone who is cheating on their bf in a public setting. don't do shit like that in front of a bunch of acquaintances if you're worried about gossip!", "You're saying that like it matters.\n\nOdd.", "Yes, your immature reply has changed my mind, cheater defender.", "I was quoting Star Wars for some levity.
