My parents and I have since sent two of our dogs over the rainbow bridge, the first one had to cross over the rainbow bridge very unexpectedly, and the second one also had to be sent over unexpectedly although not as suddenly, we were able to be there with them in their final moments, just hugging them, kissing them, telling them how much we loved them, how they were good girls, how we'll see them again, stuff like that and while it was absolutely soul-crushing to lose them it was a little bit easier than losing our rabbit because we were able to be present with them in those final moments.

I'm glad you were there and I'm sorry the step dad was so unkind to your dad about it. I'm not sure what his motivation is but I doubt he is trying to replace your dad. It seems that there were a lot of raw feelings and sometimes people don't think that kids should participate in end of life situation like that.  Quite possibly that was it.

I took the boy to the skateboard park and out for ice cream or lunch after.   Dad wasn't around. Father's Day rolls around and their dad, who does nothing, gets a card while I, who does everything with mom, gets not even a nod of thanks. \n\nIs he trying to \"be your dad\" or is he just trying to fill a role for you? He's THERE so he's being responsible. That's something.  Give him a chance at least. He may not know or understand. He's still young and has a lot to learn.  It's really not easy to help raise other people's kids.  He's not your father but he is thrust into that role to some degree. And mom needs help sometimes.\n\nAs for the dog, I'm sorry.  I know how hard that is.  You're right.  You need to be able to say goodbye and your dog likely wants to be with you when he goes too. They need that love.  They look for you.

It's disgusting!", "Um you know you do not need to explain this stuff as Ive been living with Type 1 diabetes for 18 yrs now and already have known all this for that period of time. That is also how I know the cost of Insulin in the US. I spent a period of time without insurance,lemme just say not all that fun. 1 box of 2 Humolog pens was $500. \n\nFurthermore from what I hear,a lot have issues with that insulin from Walmart.\n\nIts fucking absurd for Insulin to cost that much. It is extremely cheap to make.", "My baby was miserable and in pain. He didn't know what was happening and he just wanted to rest. Whether it was me holding him or the doctor as long as he finally got relief he would be ok.\n\nI'm not a bad person. The vets don't judge me and I can't judge myself either.", "Sorry you feel that way but it\u2019s not always accessible for certain places. I wanted to be there for my bunny when she had to be put down due to a neurological problem that had her unable to walk and we still don\u2019t know what happened. It was so bad that she would pee on the spot and unable to move. That was so hard to see and even tried exercises so we can get her legs to function again but she kept declining. \n\nI wanted to be there for her but I was told I couldn\u2019t due to COVID issues and had to leave her behind as well the procedure for rabbits were different from cats/dogs for some reason I can\u2019t remember but I do remember I couldn\u2019t be there for her as much as I wanted to. So get your head out of your butt and think much more from\nDifferent sides of life and have better empathy. When you deal with death after death in the same year it will mess you up mentally.", "I also had a cat that developed diabetes as he got older.  IDK if it was the high-value treats he got when receiving his injections (and ONLY then) or just because he felt better afterwards, but it didn't take our cat long to get VERY vocal when it was time for his shots. \n\nHe'd start trying to herd us into the kitchen & yell at us about 15 minutes before his medication time - we joked that he needed his \"fix\".\n\nHe was diagnosed at around 10 years old and lived to be 19.  RIP Smokey Joe.", "Sorry, I thought you were looking for information.", "I\u2019m so sorry to hear about your cat. My dog had been having leg issues and when we took her to the vet earlier in the year they told us she was partially paralyzed which added to our decision that it was best to put her down. My parents waited until I had graduated to make the appointment so I could at least say goodbye (I was at a college five hours away so it wasn\u2019t easy trying to move between home and school). I\u2019m just glad we, my parents and I, got to be there. My brothers didn\u2019t make it to the appointment because one lives far away and the other had work that he couldn\u2019t get out of and I don\u2019t consider them bad people at all. They loved her as much as I did.", "I need empathy? You need to really figure out what empathy is. And obviously if a vet isn\u2019t allowing you to be there then that\u2019s a whole different ball game. I would see a different vet if I were you though. \n\nWhat we are talking about here is people who are literally choosing not to be with their pet when they get a lethal injection. I don\u2019t give a crap whether someone can handle it or not. You suck it up and hold them. End of discussion.", "Nope,making a point about the absurdity.", "No you\u2019re lacking majorly from it and the vet I went to is one of the better ones. You\u2019re just childish that acts as if they know how everything works. \n\nIt\u2019s not an end of discussion if you\u2019re trying to bulldoze your way thru. You act as if you\u2019re hier than thou and Better than anyone at this point. Honestly that makes you lack of empathy. Empathy is understanding not what you\u2019re doing here. You\u2019re generalizing a huge group and I simply gave one example of my own experience  and you\u2019re already trying to challenge it full simply by telling me I need another vet. Everyone has different circumstances and different scenarios in what they do. That\u2019s empathy is simply being understanding for those people who are unable to make that decision or making that decision.", "Us talking about one VERY specific topic means that I am acting as if I know how everything works? I don\u2019t know shit about a lot of things. But I am very familiar with animals and having to say goodbye to them. \n\nA vet shouldn\u2019t keep you from your animal unless it would put your animal in harms way. I may not know a ton about being a vet but I do know how google works and it clearly states that the best way to put a rabbit to sleep is the exact same way for a cat or dog. So I\u2019m confused as to how or why you wouldn\u2019t be allowed near your pet. And either way it\u2019s not even a point of this discussion so why we need to be talking about your friggin rabbit makes no sense. The topic here is about people deciding NOT to be with their pets.\n\nYou do in fact have empathy. And it is very misplaced in my opinion. I empathize with the animal who is in its final moments of life. You are empathizing with the people who are making the decision for their animal that it\u2019s time to end the suffering and lack their own empathy and responsibility to be there and hold their animal through the decision that it doesn\u2019t get to make.", "Nope I empathize with both sides of coin. You may think we are different topics but it\u2019s still the same topic. The way you talk is very generalizing and I would be in that group. the words you speak says you act as if you know but you don\u2019t. That\u2019s arrogance and extremely ignorant on the subject matter when dealing with the medical side of things.\n\nMy rabbit does make sense, because I couldn\u2019t be there. The very same person you despise cuz I wasn\u2019t there for her. The same scenario of an owner who couldn\u2019t be there for their pet. We all had different circumstances and different scenarios but nonetheless I was still wasn\u2019t there for her. It can be ranged to where someone not making it in time due to work/traffic/life event, pet dying right after their owner leaves, or out of nowhere while the owner was gone. You don\u2019t know their circumstances so you shouldn\u2019t spouting your hate on the subject."]}
