First, it was very mature and compassionate for you to be there when your lifelong friend's time came. I'm sorry for your loss.  \n\n\nTo the point; you're absolutely right. Your Mom's husband is *not* your father. While it would be to everyone's benefit for you to try to cultivate a civil relationship with him, this isn't the sort of thing where he has *any* business butting in. Hell, I think your actual biological parents would've been wrong for trying to prevent you from being there.", "NTA. Exhausted by presumptuous step people. They are only family if both sides agree. Not just because the adult decides they want the job. Good intentions or otherwise. It's not right to presume such a role.", "That age gap tho lol", "NTA \n\nIt was not his place to insert himself into a situation where he wasn't invited. Nobody asked for his opinion. I'm glad you were able to be there. It's so important for a pet to have the comfort of its people at such a time.", "NTA\n\nYou have a dad and a mom. He's neither.\n\nBut that's true for everything. You don't get to say that and then expect things from him.", "NTA. He needs to know his place and stay in it.", "NTA - Sounds like stepdad has trauma from his own experience. That shouldn't be reflected onto you. I'm glad you told him to step out. You did the best thing for your best friend. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA You already have a dad. A dad you love and have a relationship with. And no new guy just because he is married to your mom is gonna replace your dad. And that wa your beloved childhood pet. You had every right to decide if you wanted to be there or not.", "NTA, it\u2019s totally inappropriate for your step parent to argue with your parent in front of you like that. Maybe he has traumatic memories of the loss of his own pet that caused him to act in that way, maybe he\u2019s just a jerk.", "NTA \u2013 he\u2019s a d-bag married to your mom.

It\u2019s insulting that your stepfather questioned your father\u2019s judgment. \n\nIf you want to try to smooth things over with your stepfather, you could tell him you appreciate that he wants what\u2019s best for you, but your father does too. It was a difficult time and you snapped. Adults should be able to understand.", "NTA.  You're the only adult in the room.  I commend you for being their for Matt.

But not if you're 15.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I was about your age when I had to have my wonderful rabbit, who was my first real pet, put down due to her having an infection in her brain that was causing seizures. My parents and I weren't able to be there with her in her final moments and that made things so much harder. My parents and I have since sent two of our dogs over the rainbow bridge, the first one had to cross over the rainbow bridge very unexpectedly, and the second one also had to be sent over unexpectedly although not as suddenly, we were able to be there with them in their final moments, just hugging them, kissing them, telling them how much we loved them, how they were good girls, how we'll see them again, stuff like that and while it was absolutely soul-crushing to lose them it was a little bit easier than losing our rabbit because we were able to be present with them in those final moments. All that to say, from personal experience, it hurts far more to ***not*** be with your beloved pet in their final moments than it is to be with them.", "Defs NTA, it\u2019s not traumatising to say goodbye to your little bro-dog, it\u2019s healthy! It would\u2019ve been traumatising to take that decision away from you.", "Good on you for giving your friend the final gift of comfort as he passed.  Matt loved you very much, OP.", "NTA\n\nNo, he didn't have good intentions. He married your mother a year ago and since you live at your dads he probably barely knows you or how strong you are as an individual.

I'm glad you were there and I'm sorry the step dad was so unkind to your dad about it. I'm not sure what his motivation is but I doubt he is trying to replace your dad. It seems that there were a lot of raw feelings and sometimes people don't think that kids should participate in end of life situation like that.  Quite possibly that was it. Maybe you can explain to him how meaningful it was for you to be there to comfort your dog and it might be something he can understand.", "NTA.\n\nYou're 15, not 5. That's plenty old enough for you to determine whether you can handle the reality of death.\n\nThe not asking you initially was bad enough but could probably let it slide. The response of step father just acting like you weren't there and yelling at your Dad for it was disrespectful and out of line.\n\nI hope he apologizes and maybe you guys can talk. I don't know why he's treating you like you don't know your own mind...", "NTA. This guy overstepped and someone had to let him know it.", "NTA. Your mom married a kid half her age and he\u2019s trying to be dad when he isnt. He was 15 when you were born ffs. \n\nPretty sure what you want here is important and this guy should shove it.", "Of course not. I have a step dad who has never learned to mind his own business. Constantly getting involved in personal disputes between me and my mother and always overstepping his boundaries. I have told him this crap several times and he never got the memo.

In fact, I can see her never speaking to, or seeing, him again. At least not until matey is out of the picture and even then...\n\nNTA. Stand your ground fella.", "NTA. He wouldn't be your father even if your dad was out of the picture. What you said was perfectly true and entirely reasonable even if your stepdad did have 'good intentions'.

Yes he deserves respect but he must respect you as being nearly an adult. \n\nI won't devalue his input since step-parents are still parents but he was put voted 3-1 so he should have just let it go.\n\nI don't blame you for yelling either. Your beloved fur-family member had just died. All y'all's emotions were high. He shouldn't take it to heart. Hopefully next time y'all talk, y'all will be respectful towards each other.", "Nta, your step dad tried to be controlling and harmful, you dont need to be civil", "NTA, step parents need to back the fuck off and realize, that with very few exceptions, they arent actual parents.", " You're not nearly at the level of an adult and your treatment of the people trying to look after you shows as much.", "First, I'm sorry for your loss. A slight AH for how rude you said what you said but NTA for needing to say it.", "NTA. However you better never ask the man for anything ever. You made it clear how you feel so I hope he never helps you in anyway.", "NTA, but did you ever think maybe your stepdad went through the same thing and it actually traumatized him?", "Soft YTA. Your mom is right, you could have been more civil.", "NAH. Watching something die isn\u2019t an easy thing, especially for a child.", "As someone who's had to try to fill A role of some kind, I know how hard it can be. I'm not the dad but I AM providing for the family (Dad wasn't providing child support).  I do take the kids to the doctor, pay for groceries, take them out to dinner, take them to movies, etc. I taught the girl how to drive. I let her drive my car to school. I took the boy to the skateboard park and out for ice cream or lunch after.   Dad wasn't around. Father's Day rolls around and their dad, who does nothing, gets a card while I, who does everything with mom, gets not even a nod of thanks. \n\nIs he trying to \"be your dad\" or is he just trying to fill a role for you? He's THERE so he's being responsible. That's something.  Give him a chance at least. He may not know or understand. He's still young and has a lot to learn.  It's really not easy to help raise other people's kids.  He's not your father but he is thrust into that role to some degree. And mom needs help sometimes.\n\nAs for the dog, I'm sorry.  I know how hard that is.  You're right.  You need to be able to say goodbye and your dog likely wants to be with you when he goes too. They need that love.  They look for you.

For many of those people who can't be there, it will absolutely break them to experience that. We always sedate the pets first, so that it's peaceful and they don't pass away scared. Most owners that can't be there for the actual euthanasia stay with their pets while the sedation kicks in.
