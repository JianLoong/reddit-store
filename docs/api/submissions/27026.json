My parents and I have since sent two of our dogs over the rainbow bridge, the first one had to cross over the rainbow bridge very unexpectedly, and the second one also had to be sent over unexpectedly although not as suddenly, we were able to be there with them in their final moments, just hugging them, kissing them, telling them how much we loved them, how they were good girls, how we'll see them again, stuff like that and while it was absolutely soul-crushing to lose them it was a little bit easier than losing our rabbit because we were able to be present with them in those final moments.

I'm glad you were there and I'm sorry the step dad was so unkind to your dad about it. I'm not sure what his motivation is but I doubt he is trying to replace your dad. It seems that there were a lot of raw feelings and sometimes people don't think that kids should participate in end of life situation like that.  Quite possibly that was it.

I took the boy to the skateboard park and out for ice cream or lunch after.   Dad wasn't around. Father's Day rolls around and their dad, who does nothing, gets a card while I, who does everything with mom, gets not even a nod of thanks. \n\nIs he trying to \"be your dad\" or is he just trying to fill a role for you? He's THERE so he's being responsible. That's something.  Give him a chance at least. He may not know or understand. He's still young and has a lot to learn.  It's really not easy to help raise other people's kids.  He's not your father but he is thrust into that role to some degree. And mom needs help sometimes.\n\nAs for the dog, I'm sorry.  I know how hard that is.  You're right.  You need to be able to say goodbye and your dog likely wants to be with you when he goes too. They need that love.  They look for you.

He trying to deny that moment for you is AH and you responded with same likeness, no matter of intentions.

Step dad has no say", "I'm so sorry about your dog. I hope he had an easy way over the rainbow bridge. \n\nNTA the new partner of your mother had no right to intervene, you are old enough to make such a decision.

He has some cheek telling off your dad because of what he thinks about a decision you and your dad made about you being there. You live with your dad who knows you.

Being a pet owner the decision to help our pets cross over is the hardest part of ownership. But we repay the unconditional love and smiles they have given us through the years. You sound mature but my only advice is watch your words. Your stepfather needs boundaries but when you advocate for yourself choose your words carefully. I understand you were upset and rightfully so but next time use a word or words your parents have established with the stepfather. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry about your dog.

He should have been trying to build a good repor with you and kept all this to himself. For the future, though, try not to be so aggressive towards him. He is married to your mother, whom I'm guessing you do love. You've said what you've said, so just own it, but grow past. I understand you're young, but he probably isn't going anywhere, and you will save yourself a lot of grief. \nI suggest that you discuss this with your mother. Tell her how it made you feel and ask her to talk to him about this. He overstepped his role and as his wife and your mother, she needs to make him understand that you don't need that from him. His role as a step is to support and encourage you, not dictate his feelings.", "NTA\n\nWhilst it's not necessarily him trying to be your dad, it is definitely him being out of line and ignoring your decision to be there.

It sounds like he will be a continuing part of your life, and you will both need to respect one another and get along. That includes him knowing your boundaries and accepting them.", "NTA - if you have a good relationship with your dad then step-dad needs to learn his place.", "I fully expected this to be a case where the stepdad tries to be present and caring and just a snide, entitled, ahole, of a kid trying to create conflict where there is none.\n\nThis is not the case.  If you wanted to be present for your furry family member's crossing, and your bio dad provided the opportunity, it's not your step dad's place to attempt to interfere.\n\nThere is a time and a place to add input.

I've made it clear to everyone, I was not going to be placing myself into parental decisions, will respect them.\n\nYou just clearly told him to respect your boundaries, and also your own authority, not only your parent's, you are 15 not 7.\n\nYou might want to have a discussion with your mom and him, or your mom alone or him alone. State clearly what bothered you in the situation, and make sure to use an appropriate tone and discuss calmly (as much as possible) \n\nYour parents still have some authority over you, but even if he married your mom, he's not your parent.

And your Dad was right for letting you decide", "Perhaps\u2026it really depends on how often your day stuff like this to him and how much your step dad tries to intervene and the manner he does so. Stepdad was looking out for your best interest and he knows that he\u2019s not your dad. These are complicated emotions, so I understand your lashing out. Your stepdad is an adult and should be able to process you being upset. However, it is awesome to have support and love from a whole group of people, even if they\u2019re not your bio-parent. \nI\u2019m not going to say whether your an ah or not, because I really don\u2019t have enough info to judge.
