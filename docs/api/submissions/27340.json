It is reasonable to expect an adult to know their NINO or to have correspondence with it on, and these days I believe it's on child benefits or birth documentation - I'm old, it wasn't when I was born ;p. So, 'ask your mum' is a reasonable response.)", "This seems like an innocuous interaction from your perspective.\n\nMy only thought on why they might be upset - you know they live at home, but do you know they have a mom there?  Is there maybe something up with the mom that they would be sensitive about?  Maybe the mom left, or is an alcoholic and the dad is the one to ask, or the mom is career-focused and the dad is a SAHD.  Or maybe they have two dads?  If they have a situation like that, they may have thought it was a dig at them.\n\nProbably just a young person being sensitive, and I think you were NTA, but \"ask a parent\" is probably better language to use as a default (as opposed to the mom being the \"default parent\").", "NTA Being a retired teacher myself, I can completely believe this happened exactly the way you wrote it.\n\nI had a mother once send me a note telling me that the reason her daughter had not done her homework was because she had a sudden allergy to pencil lead.\n\nYour story pales in comparison to some of the craziness teachers deal with.", "NTA. \n\nHowever, as a parentless teen/adult myself, I\u2019ve learned to never assume there\u2019s a parent that can help at home. Even if there is an adult at home, even if that person is the persons parent, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re an active or helpful parent. Because of my own situation I don\u2019t ever say \u201cask your mom\u201d or \u201ctalk to your dad\u201d unless I know the person very well and know their parental situation. The amount of times I\u2019ve been left to figure shit out on my own because whoever I\u2019m talking to *assumes* my mother would be able to help is disheartening and kind of frustrating. Yes my mom SHOULD know my social security number and yes she SHOULD have a card for me. But she doesn\u2019t. I had to figure it out on my own because every adult I tried to get help from just assumed my parents would have my card or know my number. And then I was mocked for being an adult that didn\u2019t know it. How am I supposed to know if my own parents don\u2019t? I didn\u2019t know my social security number until well into young adulthood.\n\nI\u2019m just saying, you didn\u2019t do anything intentionally wrong, but in the future try to avoid \u201cask your mom.\u201d It\u2019s dismissive, unhelpful, and assumes there\u2019s a parent that can help at home. You\u2019d be shocked how many students don\u2019t have parents, or at least don\u2019t have active parents. If a student is asking you for help, they\u2019ve likely already considered asking their own parents, or they already did ask their own parents. Next time try to help without assuming there is a parent to turn to.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird for the student not to know the number, because they\u2019re still fairly young and probably not used to filling out legal forms (also due to some context below). That being said, \u201cask your mom\u201d is risky even if you know they live at home. You don\u2019t necessarily know if they have 2 dads; dad & stepmom; live with relatives or foster parents; mom may be abusive or have issues with drugs or mental illness, etc. You aren\u2019t an asshole for saying it, I just would advise you to try something like \u201cis there someone that you can ask? Maybe a parent or guardian?\u201d The student definitely shouldn\u2019t have reported you, and you should explain to your supervisor what happened and that you weren\u2019t trying to insult anyone, you just thought that a parent might have the necessary information. \n\nContext:\nI\u2019m Canadian so I\u2019m assuming this is like a SIN (social insurance number). People my parent\u2019s age had to give this out for a lot of forms, so it was common to have memorized. Due to identity theft risks there have now been laws passed that make it illegal to request this information except in very specific circumstances (payroll and tax forms, etc). So I rarely use it and don\u2019t have it memorized, neither do most of my friends (early 30s). I do have the card with the number printed on it that I can grab when I need it (kept at home in case I lose my wallet), but my parents kept that until I was in my teens at least - maybe until I got my first job at 16? I eventually ended up saving the number in my phone for convenience.", "NTA: the student trying to start drama for no reason\ud83d\ude29", "NTA\n\nGood lord.  What's with people these days?", "Ugh, sounds like a typical student trying to make drama out of nothing. You're not the asshole for telling them to ask their mom, that's just common sense.

I understand your intentions were good, but you need to challenge your own subconscious bias, avoid making assumptions, and move towards using more inclusive language by default. I also find it interesting you assume \u201cmum\u201d is the parent who knows this stuff and looks after the paperwork. \n\nAs much as your student\u2019s reaction seems like overkill to you, there might well be something that makes them feel particularly sensitive about your response. Students might have a single dad, two dads or a trans or nonbinary parent or parents, have been raised by grandparents, have lost a parent etc. Those that do have a mum may not be in a position to ask them if there\u2019s conflict or abuse at home, if illness or disability makes it difficult, or for a myriad of other reasons. It can be frustrating and upsetting for students from families outside the traditional cishet nuclear 2.4 kids norm to deal with assumptions like yours, and more so if there\u2019s something difficult or traumatic going on. \n\nIn future, I would avoid gendered terms unless you\u2019re 100% sure, and probably steer away from \u201cparent\u201d too, although with undergraduates it\u2019s difficult to know what to use instead - I use \u201cyour grownup(s)\u201d with primary kids by default but it\u2019s a bit young for undergrads. Perhaps \u201csomeone at home\u201d if you are absolutely certain it\u2019s relevant, but in this scenario would steer students towards solutions they can find independently. \n\nFor this specific scenario might be useful to know that people can log on to the Government Gateway website to find their NI number. [This](https://www.gov.uk/lost-national-insurance-number) might be helpful.
