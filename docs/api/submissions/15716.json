This is probably significant of deeper issues in your relationship.", "Personally, if I lost $20 that shit would be bugging me for weeks. I'd be in traffic and itd randomly pop in my head and id search my car for it.

Almost everything can be done with debit/credit so if cash is lying around it's almost always for something specific like work lunch or gas pool\n\nIf my partner just assumed cash was free game and took the $20 I needed to get a burrito off the roach coach, I'd be pissed", "Cheers! :) And agree!
