To completely butcher the order to suit his preferences only is massively overstepping however.\n\nNext time, he needs to pay attention to them previous orders - the selections ordered, the amounts bought, and consider what was left over before making any big changes.", "NTA, if he pulls this again, take ALL of the leftover supreme pizzas and donate them to a food bank, or homeless shelter.

My work did a pizza party and for SOME REASON there were 2 Hawaiian, 2 BBQ chicken, 2 uber Supreme (with tons of mushrooms) and 2 veggie (with tons of mushrooms).  They were all dripping with toppings.  As someone who doesn't like bbq sauce or mushrooms it was such a depressing choice.  Everyone know you should order at least one cheese and one pepperoni!!!

I then also had to order a special gluten free pizza, as well.   \n\nReally, pizza can be tough to order because everyone has their topics they like, and despise.   Then throw in appetizers and it can open up a direct wormhole to hell.  Although the spinach/artichoke dip was liked by most.

Our dorm/meal plan was *mandatory* for 2 years so people had to eat there else they would be wasting like 3K a year on food they didn\u2019t eat. I had veggie friends and friends with a variety of allergies and they were basically doing roulette each time because food wasn\u2019t properly labeled, was cross-contaminated, and there were very few vegetarian mains (some days there were none except the salad bar). They also chronically undercooked chicken at the grill to the point where one student made an anonymous Instagram page where people would send in pictures of their pink chicken and they would post them to expose the dining hall lol. We formed a whole student government committee to bully the catering company and school and eventually got them to include veggie burgers, gluten free breads, proper signage for allergies, shut down the chicken until the workers had a food safety class, etc. the food wasn\u2019t really any tastier after that but at least it wasn\u2019t poisoning people anymore", "There should always be excess cheese or veggie pizza if anything left since basically anyone can eat that unless they have allergies. And what about the dairy free folks? It doesn\u2019t sound like he ordered even a single pizza that they could eat.
