Ever since young, he\u2019s always bullied me for not being as smart as him, and sneering at my passion for sports. Our parents tried to stop him, but Asian household meant they valued brains over brawn so he was always favoured growing up. Less so now as I have a stable job and able to show my worth. I still do love them, but not Tim. He can\u2019t bully me as much as I out-muscle and outsize him, but the insults and jabs over 10 years are a sticking point. \n\nEnd of last year, I came out as gay. My parents took time to accept it, dad is even going to Asian support groups to find out more. Tim however went off the rockers, verbally screaming at how I was a disgrace and a shame, I must have ruined our genes, mocking whether I even had a \u2018real penis\u2019. Mum says that he just needs more time to process, but he\u2019s shown none of that, getting worse and joining this religious group at his university.\n\nThis weekend, I came home late to find my room had been emptied completely. My clothes, posters, all my gym and sport equipment, all my books, everything gone. The only thing intact was my laptop. I asked my parents and they had no idea as they were out, and left the house to Tim and his \u2018project group\u2019. Called him downstairs, and he said that he was curing my \u2018perverted ways\u2019 and that him and his religious group are going to \u2018change me for the better\u2019. I won\u2019t repeat all he said, but he made a list of everything he threw out and why each made me a pervert. Among the items he threw out was a signed item worth $1200.\n\nI am finally fed up, and straight up told my parents that either he stays or I stay, but I\u2019m not living with someone who hates me. I recounted since young about him bullying, insulting, stealing and ruining my stuff (this wasn\u2019t the first). I made it clear that while I love them, if they still supported Tim ruining my life, I was cutting off contact. I grabbed my laptop and bag (because I had nothing left) and left, staying at a friend\u2019s place.\n\nI\u2019ve cooled down, and called my mum saying that I won\u2019t cut off contact, but while Tim is still living at home, I won\u2019t ever be visiting. She has begged me to reconsider, that we can still fix the relationship, that she and dad are getting my stuff back, but I\u2019m adamant that I can\u2019t co-exist with Tim. I have money saved up so I can rent and survive easily enough, so living is not an issue for me, unlike Tim who's still studying.\n\nMy friends support my decision to move out, but my relatives have been saying that I\u2019m going overboard, that I shouldn\u2019t punish my parents for what Tim did, that I should still show \u2018filial piety\u2019. They all say I\u2019m an asshole for forcing my parents between two sons, even if Tim is wrong. I am close to my relatives, I have a cousin who may as well be my actual brother, and even he thinks I should not be so aggressive with cutting Tim out. I do feel bad for my parents, but I don't think I'm wrong to get away from that toxicity.

There's no question.", "NTA - Your brother not accepting your lifestyle is one thing. Your brother going out of his way to get rid of your stuff while nobody is home is a completely different thing. That's beyond out of control and your parents shouldn't forgive Tim for this either. After all, chances are they paid for a lot of that stuff too. I was the favorite child and spoiled rotten growing up, but I can tell you this from experience but I greatly admire my sibling for making a life of their own. The best revenge is success.

You are absolutely in the right by finding a safe space to live instead.\n\nYour brother's behaviour was atrocious. I hope you can continue to have a good relationship with your parents, but your brother is the one at fault here, and that relationship should be on pause until he can sort some things out.\n\nFrom one queer to another, sometimes you're born into family, sometimes you grow into a family.

Stay away from all of them, because as you said, your parents have enabled Tim's bullying behavior for years and basically swept it under the rug, pretending it doesn't exist. Be extremely cautious regarding his newfound religious beliefs; they are just as toxic as his bullying you for most of your life. Press whatever charges you can against him for throwing away your things, and file a protective order against him so he can't be within a certain distance from you at any time.

He stole and threw out your stuff, there needs to be consequences for that.", "NTA. I'm sorry your brother is abusive and your parents have enabled him. Their enabling him as he bullied you as a child has likely led to him being unable to accept when he's wrong as an adult and you should absolutely keep firm in going no contact with your brother. It's unlikely he'll ever change. I hope that you can have some sort of relationship with your parents in the future if you so choose, but please remember to put yourself first. You deserve better!", "NTA.\n\nThis is exactly the type of situation where the parents have to make a tough judgment call. They want to bury their heads in the sand and keep their two sons together but it is clearly not working.\n\nYou did the right thing in getting away and forcing their hand.

I\u2019m confused as to why you think Tim is smarter than you? Is it merely because he\u2019s been telling you this?", "NTA\n\nHoly Jalape\u00f1o! Tim's actions are those of an unhinged fundamentalist. What they did was theft and destruction of property, and for our own safety and mental health, you need to stay as far away as you can from him and his 'project group'.\n\nMake sure you do not come in contact with Tim when you decide to visit your parents. He will make a scene, try to shame you and may even call his posse again to gang up on you.\n\nI will not call your parents A H, but they are at least na\u00efve if they think your relationship with Tim can be salvaged after the stunt he pulled.\n\nAs for your relatives, they weren't the ones who had to deal with all the toxicity, so their opinions are completely misguided. \n\nDo not cave in, OP. Your brother does not care about your wellbeing, only his distorted ideas. Why should you risk getting hurt again just to appease the rest of the family?", "NTA, Tim needs therapy and a reality check", "NTA \n\nFirst of all, nothing wrong with being gay. Hopefully you have enough support to make it through.\n\nSecond, I would press charges against your brother for theft. Make a good list of what you had and add photo's.\n\nThird, your parents are propper people. As far as I understand they make an effort to understand you and try to become more familiar and loving with who you are.\n\nNow, since they are like that you could invite them to your place or go out. Explain again how you have felt since you were younger and now and that your brother is going medieval. I could imagine they understand your stand and will work with it.\n\nAlso, you don't force them to choose. You just say, I don't want to be in the same space/building as my brother. That's very doable.\n\nI'd say go live your life to the fullest and without your brother.\n\nOw and btw, since your brother is now a fundamentelist believer, you have outsmarted him by a billion years.", "NTA\n\nMake it a contingency on \"forgiving\" your brother that you record his confession of what he did, who helped him, how he did it, and why he did it.  Then use that recording as evidence when you file police charges against him and his accomplices and sue him for property damage.", "NTA.  I'll be the first to admit that I don't come from a culture that inherently values filial piety as much as your family's culture does.  But one thing that I would point out to you is that these types of power dynamics, where one person or group is in a position of authority and others are supposed to be obedient to that authority, have certain implied responsibilities from both sides of the agreement.  The one that always gets publicized is that the one person, group, or party is supposed to be obedient to person or group with authority, but the one that gets ignored is that the group in the position of authority is obliged to ensure that the people being obedient are well taken care of.  Your parents, despite their best intentions and efforts, are not doing that right now.\n\nIf your parents can't hold up their end of the bargain, you shouldn't feel an obligation to hold up yours.", "NTA.

But the truth is your brother is involved with a cult and you're not safe around him, thing that your cousin is probably not grabbing.\nI also suggest you to push charges not against your brother (would make the situation worse) but against the group itself in order to protect yourself and further people who could do the same.\nAlso: blame on your parents for not forbidding the group to enter their house", "NTA\n\n>Tim however went off the rockers, verbally screaming at how I was a disgrace and a shame\n\nHomophobia 100% ah.\n\nTim is not making you feel welcome. If he doesn't leave you must. I love that your dad is going to support groups that is a much healthier way of coping that what Tim is doing. Honestly if you feel like you've given it all you can I can't blame you for doing this. \n\nIF AT ALL POSSIBLE I would suggest sitting down with Tim and telling him what you are doing. If he is happy for you to destroy the relationship you have with your family he is not worth putting up with. If he is willing to have his parents defend his horrific views instead of accepting you into the house then the guy doesn't deserve to have you in his life.", "NTA \n\nI hope you press charges Against your brother and his group for stealing your stuff and demand apologies and restitution", "Ask your friends and family where and when you should draw the line then?

But without truly understanding said culture and language, you may know the joke, but you'll never quite get it and find it funny, especially if you hear the joke much later in life.\n\nIts why representation in media is important. Just being even slightly aware of specific gay people existing out there in the world, or even in fictional media, goes a long way in making that learning curve easier.", "100%", "There may not be clear translations of the terms he's using - insults are often figurative, so literal translations aren't that helpful.", "The temptation would be soooo strong.", "Please hear that you express to your parents and family that a home should be safe. Being robbed from and harassed even by a family member is far from safe. You can\u2019t live there because it\u2019s not a safe environment for you. Don\u2019t let your parents/family know where you live/are staying. Always meet them at neutral spaces from now on because your brother can\u2019t be trusted. If he escalates you might need to transfer somewhere else. It would suck to lose support structures like your friends but I\u2019m worried your brother\u2019s new found friends might take it upon themselves to harm you for your brother.", "The dumbells part got me.  I get the feeling your brother is very insecure about his physical attributes.  I don't think he can stand that you are \"better\" than him at anything.  I'm guessing the physical strength/muscle tone difference between you two is quite striking.", "The company I work for also looks favorably on people who were in competitive teams, especially for applicants just out of college, since they often don't have a ton of work experience. Doesn't have to be a sport, but anything that demonstrates your ability to work in a team environment is a positive. It shows you can work with people who you may not personally like, you understand that your other team members are counting on you to do your part, and you understand that if the team doesn't succeed, no one on the team wins.", "Why do you think that cutting off parents who are financially and emotionally supporting your bully is wrong?", "I don't think there was sarcasm there....", "gum chewing is still an issue, I assume?", "[This guy has a lot of influence in Uganda](https://youtu.be/euXQbZDwV0w).

With a brother like that I would straight up go to the cops and report him as homophobic.", "Wow such a punishment. Leave, tell them to repay everything as they are supporting your brother's behaviour and lifestyle. Don't cut them off completely but cut off the brother.

They will want you to be the biger person and ignore his abuse and threats and stealing from you b/c \"family\".\n\nIf they thought family was important, they would have stood up for you, their son, a long time ago. I mean REALLY stand up, not just wagging theor finger  at your brother. If they REALLY believed in family, they would have never allowed their son thentreat their other son this way. The one NOT showing family vales in your brother, yet he has gotten a pass for years and you are being called unfair b/c you have had enough. \n\nUnderstand that you brother and his friends are threatening you. Religious geoups like the one he joined pomote tourture techniques to \"make\" people straight. We are not just talking money here. He is straight up threatening to kidnapping and torture the \"gay\" out of you. \n\nYour parents are not idiots. They know your brother and his friends are a phyaical threat to you, but they want you back in the home to make themselves feel better and look good, your safety be dammed.\n\nYou need to understand that your parents had a huge role in creating this monster and that ultimately, their soloution is to have you continue to suffer abuse and hate while they wag their fingers at your brother, but continue to support and pamper him.\n\nThey don't care nearly enough about what your brother has done to you your entire life. They would rather LOOK like good parents than BE good parents. They would rather you be in danger than have your brother suffer the slightest of consequences.", "He committed a felony with the amount that he stole.", "Tell your parents and brother you will be filing a police report and letting the university know what this \"student organization\" has done.", "Because they have two kids to care for.\n\nThey are supportive of OP and they can't control his asshole brother, they can only control themselves.\n\nAsking parents to kick out one child is putting them in an impossible situation.", "In the post op states that the parents aren\u2019t home or aware of what brother Dad to his room.", "Actually, the parents were gone when brother came in and stole all his stuff.", "Depending on where they live, the cops may be on the brother's side over that.", "First off, they have two adults.
