I wish you strength and peace.", "YTA\n\nIf you completely keep your kid from their sibling and hide that the sibling exists. Neither child is responsible for the behavior of the parents. DNA tests are given as gifts these days. I imagine it will become even more common as the kids age. Hiding an entire sibling will lead to permanent damage to your relationship with your son. It is completely reasonable for you to want nothing to do with Christie. But you can make sure your kid knows about the sibling and allow them to meet that sibling when they are older. A day or weekend visit with the paternal grandparents would be a way for the kids to know eachother but not interact with the mom.", "NTA. \n\nSomehow, and I don\u2019t know why, but I don\u2019t believe Christie.

However, your son is going to find out someday that he's got that half-brother out there.  He may want to make contact, and you need to be prepared for that and probably should allow it even if you yourself don't have any contact with Christie.  I would suggest that when the time comes, you be honest with your son about what happened.  Secrets are never good because the truth always comes out, and if your son finds out the truth from someone else, he'll accuse you of having lied to him.", "NTA", "Nta.\n\nBut your kids are still siblings... And that's more important that a cheating dead fiance and his mistress.\n\nIt sucks. It's a shitty situation. But unfortunately it's a situation you're in.", "No, NTA.\n\nBut what you need to realize is that there are DNA services nowadays. Your child is quite likely to subscribe to one of those one day and figure out that he has a half brother. Then you will have some explaining to do. He may be resentful of you if he perceives this as you cutting ties to a link to his father.", "NTA and also don\u2019t make any final decisions now. Let your feelings flow and stay healthy. \n\nSorry for your losses and this drama, wishing you the best in the future with your baby. \n\nI can\u2019t compare, but if it helps. As a single parent, I knew I had to choose if I\u2019d enjoy it like one, or let the issues around me cloud it. My first echo/ultrasound was the day I knew I couldn\u2019t hold any grudges to my situation. My little baby was a gift if I took it like one. My feelings that day told me I\u2019d never be angry like that, if it kept love away from this child who gave me so much already. I promised myself and baby I can\u2019t be bitter, that\u2019s not the life I want. And I texted to the father - I\u2019d never hate him. He gave me the best gift. \n\n8 years later I\u2019m trying to bridge things for my child to have the other half of his family, I never closed the door or made demands. It\u2019s hard being neutral, you get used to it, and life goes on\u2026it will be ok. \n\nI\u2019m not saying I did it right, cant tell you. Just take your time if you\u2019re not sure.

You are already influencing your child.", "I would abort with the quickness but that\u2019s just me and I\u2019m not a woman so it\u2019s easy for me to say.

Alot of people want to know biological relatives.   They could become very upset at his mom if they find out that she hid this from them. \n\n  And realistically, this will come out.   Op and Christie probably have overlapping social circles.  Then there is the shared grandparents.  Are they supposed to hide the pictures of the other grand kid when s/he visits?\n\n/ she doesn't need to facilitate visits, but denying the half sib's existence will not end well for OP.", "I'll tell her to do the DNA test tomorrow (per email).", "I changed my mind and i'll let them meet, ONLY if my child wants to.", "Thanks. My boyfriend parents received everything, but they let me keep everything i wanted. I hope everything goes well and does not do that.", "I'll tell my son about his brother, and let him meet him if he wants, but Christie can't be there.", "I don't think so, but i will ask her for a DNA test again.", "Thank you for comment! :)", "Thank you! I will tell my kid about his sibling.", "Thanks for comment :)", "Thanks for your opinion", "Thanks for comment. :)", "Thanks for your comment and the kind words.\n\nI will let my kid meet his brother, but without Christie.

I'll take it into account", "I won't get an abortion. I love my kid even though he is still not born.", "OP, no judgement from me. I would just point out that realistically you might not have much control in if/how/when your kid knows about Christies kid. \n\nThat is, I imagine that you will allow some relationship of your kid with the paternal family and that the paternal family will also accept Christies kid (if proven to be related to them). Thus, the paternal family will have open relationships with both kids. Even if you not allow them to meet, they will most likely be aware of each other from the start.\n\nUnless, of course, you do not want to allow a relationship with the paternal family, or they do not want a relationship with one of the kids.", "If you are in the US she may have to have a DNA test to prove the child's connection to the paternal side if she wants to get social security benefits for the child. \n\nYou still have time to make a decisions, right now you need to focus on your own mental & physical health.  ((hugs))", "Not wanting to prove something is often an indication of lying", "Any that is totally reasonable. Kids are impressionable and exposing them to ppl like that isn't good for them either. Personally, I'd wait until they're old enough to actually understand the situation to explain it.\n\nThey aren't losing a sib they've know all their life, they just have the chance to gain one later in life.", "Then if it really hurts the best you can do is just remain neutral about the child and when your child is old enough be a supportive presence if they choose to pursue a relationship with their sibling. However you are not obligated to facilitate a relationship between them. Your friend should have thought of these consequences before she did that with your late fiance. Your child needs a healthy and happy mother more than they need a half sibling. Because to be honest in the beginning you're gonna have to do most of the work to maintain a relationship between the kids which means extensive contact between you and your ex friend. Doing that while still healing will probably severely stunt your healing journey so I wouldn't recommend it. Also with the way your friend has been acting lately I have a feeling she's going to be using her future child as a pawn for the future. You are going to be to the first person she calls when she needs something and the first person she is going to use the \"but our kids are brothers\" excuse and what's stopping her from trying to poison your child against you or harm them? Parents can alienate their kids from the other parent so it's not an impossible idea. She's literally the most untrustworthy and harmful person in your life currently. I'd suggest you just cut your losses with her and try to move on for your and your future child's sake and just let them know about the circumstances when they are old enough to understand the entire situation. Don't let yourself be manipulated and hurt anymore please. You deserve more than this.", "I am so glad you changed your mind OP. My parents kept my half sibling a secret until we all became adults and I will never forgive them for it. I understand why they did it but for me it's unforgivable. She missed my wedding because I didn't even know she existed and I missed her high school graduation and entire childhood. \n\nThat said your kid is not me and could have a very different reaction but by at least making sure they know about their sibling from a young age with the choice to meet them you'll avoid the potential future my parents and my siblings and I are dealing with.", "You are going through something incredibly difficult, and you\u2019re not wrong to try to separate yourself as much as possible from this devastating situation. \n\nMy comment was not meant to push you into any particular decision, but to demonstrate the ways in which separating yourself will become complicated over the years. \n\nYour decision to allow/support contact is one that is incredibly brave and will take a lot of effort and healing, and I applaud it. \n\nNow is the time to reach out to your support system - friends and family - for emotional support and task support. As a single mother, especially one with such a complicated situation, you will want an army of people you can call on to help you with everything from going with you to appointments, babysitting, or even taking your son to play dates with his brother or dropping him off at his grandparents so you can avoid your ex-best friend.
