Our shared crap dad wasn't enough for me to want to bond.\n\nYour kiddo may eventually want to meet his sibling, and I think you should prepare yourself for that, but you don't have to raise you kiddo alongside your ex friends just because they may be half-sibs.

People who love and support each other make a family. This woman will destabilize your relationships as she tries to insert herself into your life as some kind of fake twin or sister wife. \n\nIf this was your fianc\u00e9's child and your finace was alive to make them part of his life there might be a reason to introduce your children. If your friend hadn't told this story, your definitely would have introduced your children. They aren't brothers unless you raise them to be brothers. \n\nIDK what kind of game she is playing, but whatever it is, it isn't healthy and is always going to be underpinned with manipulation and cruelty. Protect your family from her. There is something very, very wrong here.", "Wait, did I misunderstand or did you put in the wrong times?\n\nI read Matias died in July and you found out you\u2019re pregnant 2 weeks ago.

Get a DNA test to confirm, but again, you owe her nothing, and if the DNA test confirms, this is a problem you can push down the road to deal with later.

Just focus on having a healthy baby and take care of yourself.\n\nNTA for how you reacted", "Yeah, people are often very focused on DNA connections. Since OP's child hasn't been introduced to the other child (obviously, since they're still in utero), it is no different than deciding not to have the child associate with any of her other former friends' children. DNA doesn't make a family. It can be a starting point, but it doesn't have to be.", "I put the wrong time, i converted the weeks wrong.
