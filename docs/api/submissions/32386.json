All kinds of people with all kinds of scars and injuries and disabilities and deformities use public pools. Kids need to get used to people who are different.  Car crash or self-harm, people with scars are a perfectly normal part of life and nothing to be scared of.\n\nDo NOT let this one empathy-free inconsiderate ASSHOLE spoil your fun.   You were brave, and she shit all over you, but that's not your fault, and most people won't behave as badly as she did.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThat woman was incredibly rude insulting and insensitive.\n\nPlease don't give up. Go back and if it happens again tell whoever says anything to mind their own business and to stop being rude and insulting.", "NTA - firstly kids think scars are really cool so that woman was talking out of her arse. Second, people suck and I'm sorry that this happened to you.", "Absolutely not an asshole. There\u2019s literally nothing you can do about that and it has zero negative effect on anyone else. \n\nIf anything, that woman who approached you is the asshole. She should have used this as an opportunity to teach her children about self esteem and confidence, but she went out of her way to set the exact opposite example for them.", "NTA. First off I just want to say I\u2019m so proud of you for being brave and stepping outside of your comfort zone! You deserve to live your life happy and unbothered!\n\nThat lady was an AH. Please don\u2019t let this horrendous woman bring you down, she should be so embarrassed for how she behaved. You weren\u2019t scaring the kids or anyone else, I bet you anything that that woman has her own confidence issues and takes it out on others. \n\nI hope you gain the courage to go back and wear your one piece and just enjoy yourself to the fullest!", "NTA\n\nYour encounter with this woman is extremely unfortunate; people can be irrational   \n and rude sometimes. Try not to let her prevent you from using the pool in your one-piece whenever you like. If she approaches you again, tell her her mouth is frightening to you so you'd like her to leave you alone.", "NTA. No way you were scaring the children and if you were their parents need to have a conversation about why some people might look different due to scars. I have a friend with scars all over because she had cancer and a ton of surgeries. People look like they look and other people need to learn to deal with it or mid their own business.", "NTA, obviously. If she was even remotely near being a good parent she would have taken the time to educate her children on bodies, what can happen to them and how they are all different. She could have explained kindness and acceptance and gone on with her day without you having a clue of what happened. \n\nShe's an asshole, and a shitty parent. \nYou wear whatever you want.", "NTA!!!", "NTA  \nIt blows my mind that anyone would even think of walking up to a stranger in that situation. I don't buy for a second that your scars were scaring children. Kids don't get scared of things they don't at all understand. If anything, the kid(s) were likely curious and were asking questions... mommy didn't feel like answering so she tried to get you to leave/cover up.", "NTA. You be you and never apologize.", "NTA. You should be able to go out in public dressed however you want. The lady was the ass here. Not to sound too much like an after school special, but she could have told \u201cthe children\u201d that every one is different, and that\u2019s ok we shouldn\u2019t judge people just by looks alone.\n\nI do hope you find the courage to try again", "NTA\n\nMost kids think scars are pretty cool!  I have a scar on my back and my go to explanation is \"fought a bear and lost\".  If they ask, you dont have to tell the truth!  Just make up something cool.  \n\n\"Yeah these are gnarly, I went sand surfing in the Sahara Desert.\"\n\n\"I got attacked by a giant squid when I was scuba diving!\"\n\n\"I went to Burning Man!\"", "NTA\n\nAnd she was lying. No kids are scared of scars, they think they are cool.\nWe had a teacher with some scars that he used to show us and tell stories about. Nobody thought they were scary, at most a bit curious. Most kids haven't seen many scars, and pretty much associate them to pirates or other cartoon stuff.", "NTA that women was rude. Children won\u2019t be scared by scars. They maybe ask why your skin looks different but a good parent just explains it to them and they will go on with their life. You are beautiful the way you are and scars are a sign of you being a survivor and strong. Don\u2019t ever think you have to cover up for others.", "NTA\n\nIf you had scars on your face, would she be expecting you to cover them?", "BTA of course, scars happen and that mother isn\u2019t \u201eprotecting her kids\u201c, she\u2018s missing out on a chance to teach them something.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to be out in public without having to cover yourself up. I doubt that the children were actually scared. If they were, it would have been the parents' job to explain to them that some people have scars and it's nothing to be afraid of. \n\nThat woman was cruel, insensitive, and disrespectful. I'm really sorry you had such a bad experience, especially when it was the first time you went out in a one-piece.", "If anything, you\u2019re a positive role model wearing what you want to wear. Some of those children may have scars themselves one day, and maybe they\u2019ll remember you. You have a right to exist how you want to as much as anyone and it\u2019s never too early for children to learn that.", "NTA \n\nWhen I was a kid I had surgery scars I was super self conscious about - so much so that I simply refused to go swimming, or to do anything else that might involve me revealing my torso. \n\nYou *never* saw people normalising scars and bodies that looked like mine - especially young women I could relate to. All I had was my mother telling me it \"wasn't that bad\". \n\nOf course if I'd seen you, I'd never have said a thing because I wouldn't want to make you feel self conscious, so you'd never know. But it would have been good for me to see someone like you, with scars more severe mine, just living their life.", "NTA \nKids need to be exposed to non normative bodies. And that includes scarring as well as mutations, amputations etc. Because bodies are different. You didn't tell them a scary gory tale as to how you got these scars, you just dared to have a body. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThere is always going to be one asshole who tries to ruin things.  Everyone else either wont care, wont notice or if they do notice will appreciate the strength it takes for you to wear the swimsuit.\n\nIgnore her because she isn't worth your time and good for you for being able to take this step.", "No one has the right to judge or your body. They don\u2019t know what you have experience or the consequences. Your scars are part of you and you have right to be comfortable in your own skin. It is not your responsibility to make others feel comfortable.\n\nEveryone, kids and adults alike need to more accepting of differences, no matter what and this can help kids to gain compassion and will willing to learn there is not a perfect appearance, no matter what social media pushes on society.\n\nDo want your feel comfortable with, NOT for others but for yourself, scars show that you have really struggles but also how strong you are.\n\nAs someone who have a lot of scars in my arms from self harm, which I covered up for many years, I don\u2019t and will never promote self harm, but they are part of me and reminder how low I was and what I have done to get this point in my life, not a picture of health, but aware of many triggers and using more positive coping mechanisms.\n\nYou are NTA, don\u2019t let anyone make you doubt or feel less because they are too judgemental and have no compassion. Because you will be worth more than them any day.", "NTA and you should get right back to the pool in your one piece. You've come a long way and I would hate for this busybody to set you back.\n\nIt's hard to feel positive and proud about a body that doesn't look like how we're told it's supposed to look. YOU HAVE COME SO FAR!! Don't let all the hard work go to waste. Every scar is a trophy of something you survived and overcame.", "NTA ---- DO NOT ever hide yourself away NEVER be ashamed of who or what you are, if anybody ever complains to you again about your scars or that your scaring the children, your only answer should be, well don't look then/tell them to stop staring, oh and other response I just thought of, that sounds like a you problem.", "Nta", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ONLY AH was that woman.", "Absolutely NTA.  Look, no matter how gnarly your scars are I seriously doubt they're actually scaring the children.  Even if they are, that's not your problem, it's the parents of those kids that needs to educate them better.  You shouldn't have to got to any extra lengths to use a public amenity.  Honestly I expect most kids are just going to be curious and the parent in question would rather get mad at you than teach their child not to stare or ask potentially uncomfortable questions.

I hope you find the strength to get back out there wearing whatever makes you feel beautiful.", "NTA scars happen and that woman is teaching her child to be shallow minded.", "NTA and this woman was incredibly selfish and rude. The reason children are scared is often that they are exposed to something they are not used to see. As a parent, people should take some time to explain how things like this happen, and how it is perfectly okay. \n\nYou have been extremely brave to go to therapy and to accept it. Plase, do not let this episode and some people's stupidity weaken you. You are right, and no one can make you cover you up. Take care", "NTA! Children usually are just interested not scared!

You are beautiful however many scars you have", "[removed]", "NTA, but the woman who asked you to cover up was a huge AH.\n\nI hope that you are able to go back, and swim in a one piece (or, if you want, a bikini!) and that you don't let this one rude, entitled and intolerant woman prevent you from swimming or going out in short sleeves / shorts etc. \n\nI think children are much more likely to be curious than scared, and it is the responsibility of their parents to deal with any questions or indeed any upset they might feel.\n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong, and if you have a similar experience in future, then it's totally fine to say something like \"No thanks, I'm more comfortable like this\" and them move n. If someone refuses to accept that then report to the lifeguard or other staff that they are harassing you by making unsolicited personal comments about your body and appearance. \n\n(I think you may also find you do get asked questions by younger children - you may feel more comfortable if you have a planned reply. A friend of mine who had a lot of scars used to tell children he got his scars fighting pirates. Obviously you don't owe anyone an explanation, but you might feel more comfortable having a planned response if someone is nosy or curious)", "Definitely NTA.\n\nAs some others have said, usually kids aren't scared of scars and even if a kid was scared, that is tbh not really your problem if I'm being quite honest.\n\nJust ignore people like that woman.

He's varied answers from sword fighting to wrestling with sharks/crocodiles.\n\nObviously his scars may be different to ops but the point I'm trying to make is, unlike adults, kids are almost always intrigued by what they don't understand rather than scared as the above commenter points out. It was likely the awful person speaking to you who had a problem and had to hide behind her kids because she knew she was being terrible.\n\nOp it's completely up to you what you are comfortable wearing and I know how encounters like this can really knock your confidence.
