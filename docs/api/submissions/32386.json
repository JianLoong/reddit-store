You have full right to be there and to wear what you want. Scars are a road map to where you have been in life and are memories good and bad of your life. Again screw anyone who belittles you for being you.", "never the asshole. NTA. i\u2019m so sorry", "NTA. When I was four I got really scared when I saw a woman with an amputated leg in the changing rooms at the pool because I had at that age no idea that could even happen to people. And yes it did traumatise me and made me scared it could happen to me but the solution to that would not have been for amputees to hide but for my mother to sit down with me and talk about it. If my mother had confronted that lady and told her to hide herself now THAT would have been something I would have looked back on and felt mortified about.", "Screw her. NTA.", "NTA you can\u2019t just erase scars and you shouldn\u2019t have to hide away in shame because of small minded people. I strongly doubt you were scaring children and if anything it was a chance for them to learn/ their parents to teach them that people all look different, whether that\u2019s the colour of their eyes, texture of their hair, skin tone, clothing, tattoos etc, or in this case, scars. I\u2019m really glad that you have been working through how you feel with having and showing your scars: please don\u2019t let your brilliant progress be undone by a singular prick. I understand how much courage it can take to make the first step and not hide your scars, and am really proud of you <3 keep going strong OP", "NTA- we are not responsible for anyone's reactions but our own. If a woman can't handle seeing scars, she has a problem, not you. I am sorry you had to experience someone else's insecurities/issues that they took out on you. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. If children are scared, their parents can take them somewhere else, not try and order you about.", "I'm so sorry that happened to you! Absolutely NTA!\n\nChildren don't really tend to be scared when they see someone who looks different to them, they're often curious first. There are plenty of people with scarring or conditions that cannot be hidden (not to mention people who use mobility aids like wheelchairs), so this mom is doing NO ONE a service by trying to shelter them from the reality of our diverse world.\n\nI have scars on my thighs and arms. If someone tried to make me feel ashamed when the reason I even HAVE those scars is because of how vulnerable and ashamed I felt as a child, I would throw hands SO FAST. I would be absolutely feral, so good on you for not blowing up at this woman and making a scene. You are NTA, you're a much better person than me", "NTA. I doubt the kids were actually scared. More likely, they were asking questions that the parent didn't want to take the time to answer. It's not selfish to want to be able to live your life being comfortable and not having to hide.\n\nGo out and buy yourself a fabulous new swim suit as a self reward for bravely dealing with an unhappy person.", "No, the lady was in the wrong and rude. She should have explained to the children that some people look different. It was the perfect opportunity for a learning moment in their upbringing. I'm sorry for you, you shouldn't need to have to cover up.", "Oh no children exposed to reality", "NTA\n\nlets not only think about HOW your scars would affect people.you should also consider the WHY.scars are some things that can be eventually formed on anybody's body, why would children be taught that their fear of scars is justified? scars are completely ok to have and you shouldn't worry about what children may feel about them. it's not like your scars can actually hurt them in any way, shape or form. their parents should take responsibility and teach them that their fear is irrational and that scars are a normal thing to have and people who have them deserve respect.  \nthe lady was an asshole for not taking that responsibility and telling her children in a tongue-in-cheek way that their fear of other people's physical circumstances is justified and that they are entitled to their feeling of comfort towards how other people look like while really, they aren't. don't cover yourself up for the sake of some entitled assholes who never learned to keep their head in their own ass.", "NTA. I have a large scar on my knee, it\u2019s nowhere as big as yours, but it\u2019s noticeable. I teach kindergarten and it\u2019s either ignored, or they\u2019re curious. I tell them I got it when I was their age when I tripped. Once they get the answer, they don\u2019t care. Plus I\u2019ve found that when a kid scrapes their knee they are comforted (or at least distracted) to hear about how I have a scrape too.\n\nBottom line is kids don\u2019t care about scars. I teach a kid with a big scar right now and have never heard any comments. I taught a kid missing fingers and it was approached with curiosity, or simply ignored. Don\u2019t let that awful woman keep you from feeling comfortable in your own body. Scars are nothing to be ashamed about, and the only people who seem to care are people like that awful woman.", "NTA. That woman needs to mind her business. She needs to parent her kids and teach the\n tolerance. I\u2019m sorry that your bravery was met with intolerance. If you want to wear a bathing suit, do so.", "Children are only scared because of how asshole adults behave. Like the woman who spoke to you. What is unattractive and ugly is people like that who can't accept others. Not some scars on your body. \n\nNTA", "NTA I'm sorry someone treated you this way you have every right to wear whatever you want. I've found most kids are more interested to see how people get scars then show their own", "Even if some children WERE scared, it doesn\u2019t make a difference. OP was not doing anything wrong- they were using the facilities as they\u2019re intended to be used and not harassing anyone.", "This. I was a swimmer for eight years, and I have seen a ton of different female bodies. Whenever I feel insecure after looking too much at Instagram, I go to the public pool and see all these naked women in different shapes and forms. So reassuring.\nNTA and don't cover up! And even if kids would be scared, how is it your problem? It's a great learning lesson for the.", "Agreed!  How about using her energy to talk to children about kindness and empathy for other people's suffering.  Sure wish I was the manager at this pool and OP came to me!", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that.", "Pretty much every conversation I've ever had with my child regarding everything from having a prosthetic limb to using wheelchair or walker, to having a service dog. Normalizing with your kid that everyone is different and that people don't owe you an explanation is a huge step toward teaching empathy.", "Also, men don\u2019t get criticized as much for imperfect bodies as women.", "My grandfather's stomach is also a hodgepodge of scars from several childhood surgeries (back in the 30s/40s, so impressive he survived them all). When my mom was a kid and they'd go to the beach and other kids would ask about his scars, his go to story was being \"shot with a machine gun during the war\" which obviously little kids found super impressive lol", "Good point! Some kids will cry about any damn thing.", "Honestly, this could have been an awesome teaching moment / life lesson for the parent to give the kids. Too bad the mom can\u2019t teach the kids some empathy, but it seems like something she, herself, never learned.\n\nNTA", "They really did. \n\nI have 3 kids. The youngest is a very curious kid. \nPerhaps the one with most curiosity when it comes to the world and people. \n\nIt's not uncommon we encounter something or a person that causes a question like \"mom. Why does that person only have one leg\" \nAnd for a second, I'll catch myself thinking \"oh why did you say that so loudly?\" But... that's my adult feelings. I know why someone might be missing a leg. So I don't bring attention to it. But a kid does not know. \nSo we have a small talk (in kids hight) \n\nKids really are a lot more curious. And will take most answers, and just move on with a \"aha\" \nIt's us adults that are scared of the world and things that are \"different\" \nHonestly, we could learn a lot from kids. And how they view the world a lot more simply.", "Yeah that\u2019s what I would do", "Notice how it's other women that criticize women.", "The call is coming from inside the house."]}
