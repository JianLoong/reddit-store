It's too expensive.  GF and I made reservations for all of us at XYZ restaurant.  We hope you'll join us.\"\n\nLet your GF know this is happening.  This isn't you being controlling, this is you refusing to be jerked around financially by her BFF.  \n\nIn terms of Lyn ordering all kind of food and drink for your GF, is GF OK with this?

Maybe you modeling being polite but firm in setting limits with Lyn will help her.\n\nIf your GF is a person who likes others to make all her decisions for her and take charge and tell her what to do and treat her as if she has no agency, you'd better make sure you want a relationship with a wife like this before you tie the knot.

You should have (1) told your GF that you wouldn\u2019t be paying for her friend\u2019s food and (2) told the friend that you would only be paying for you and your GFs food BEFORE going to that restaurant.

Its shitty that she seems to be taking advantage of you, but you really need to work on communicating your frustration and establishing boundaries quickly rather than changing expectations privately like you did here. If i had to take a stab, id say your GF is basing her \u201casshole\u201d verdict on the fact that you randomly made that decision without consulting her at all, in the middle of an expensive restaurant when everyone was expecting to continue the status quo.

I hope OP is able to break this successfully", "Lyn when Sammy are both AHs in this situation.", "EXACTLY.  They wanted a free EXPENSIVE meal and were abusing the gf's sweet and accommodating nature. Thank God OP has a spine. NTA", "Still works, they ate every one of the items.", "It works out as long as you roughly order meals worth the same amount, but the end result is exactly the same as splitting the check", "We don't worry too much about that. She drinks alcohol and I don't but it all works out over time.", "That\u2019s my point, though - if you order similar food and she drinks alcohol then it *doesn\u2019t* work out over time\n\nTo be clear, if you\u2019re okay with that then it\u2019s fine - but unless your food is consistently markedly more expensive than hers, then you **are** subsidising her drinks\n\nIf your meal+drink is $20 and hers is $30, then after 2 meals you\u2019ve paid $50 for $40 worth of food+drink, and she\u2019s paid $50 for $60 worth of food+drink\n\nIn many friendships it truly does \u201cwork out over time\u201d - eg if you sometimes drink and they sometimes drink it won\u2019t be the exact same every meal but it\u2019ll pretty much average out over time. But that only applies if your meals *on average* work out to be roughly the same price"]}
