That\u2019s the name that the shelter gave her, I thought it it suited her and she responds to it, so I didn\u2019t change it. \n\nThe other week, my pregnant cousin \u201cCarrie\u201d (who I\u2019m moderately close to) posted a list of potential baby names on her social media and Millie was on the list. I commented to remind her of my cat\u2019s name, and she DMed me to ask me to change Millie\u2019s name because she and her fianc\u00e9 really liked that name for their daughter. I refused because my cat had her name first, and Carrie called me selfish for valuing a \u201cstupid cat\u201d over her daughter. I told her that my cat is not stupid, and that I wouldn\u2019t mind if her baby shared a name with my cat, but if it was an issue for her, she could choose a different name. She again called me selfish and said she had to go. \n\nI was feeling a bit conflicted, so I went to my sister (a mother herself so I hoped she\u2019d offer some perspective) and she said that she understands where I was coming from, but that babies should come before pets. She said that it would be really kind of me to change my cat\u2019s name, and that she knows how important a couple\u2019s \u201cdream name\u201d is.\n\nNow I\u2019m feeling more confused than ever, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1685912779, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140qdyr/aita_for_not_changing_my_cats_name/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were right they can either still use Millie or pick a new name, they might change their mind by the time the baby arrives. Also posts a list of potential names on social media, is she trying to reserve all the names until she picks??", "NTA\n\nIt might just be pregnancy brain, but your cousin is acting entitled. Your cat already has a name, it\u2019s Millie. If your cousin doesn\u2019t want her daughter to share a name with a cat she can cope. Your sister though, she\u2019s off her rocker.", "NTA \n\nIf it is in a list of potential names calling Millie \u201cThe dream name\u201d is a bit of a stretch. Also, Millie is super common and there is literally nothing stopping from them from naming their daughter Millie. How much is this kid even going to be around this cat? How is this even an issue at all? The cat already had this name, why change.\n\nYour cousin isn\u2019t thinking about this with a clear head.", "NTA\n\nMy aunt and uncle had a dog with the same name as me. Somehow my parents and I both survived this extremely traumatic experience.", "NTA\n\nThey're seriously mad because a cat you adopted happened to have the same name that is a POTENTIAL name for their child that isn't even here yet?? Don't let them pressure you to change the name, keep the name Millie. If she's so bothered that your cat is named Millie, she can choose another name or suck it up and deal with it.", "Of course you are NTA!\n\nI really don't get the problem with having the child and cat having the same name.

The two can share a name. She doesn't own the cat you do! Both of you have the right to name said children/pet your the guardian of whatever you so please. She's not even sure if she's going to name the child Millie either yet. She told you she has a listen of names she can pick from.

Honestly.", "NTA, your sister and your cousin are being absurd.  Please keep the name.", "NTA. My cousin has both a cat, and a niece, with the same name.

Your cousin can get over herself.", "That\u2019s ridiculous. No, don\u2019t change the name. It will be confusing for that cat, which coming from a shelter, probably already has other things going on. There is no reason at all why a baby can\u2019t be named the same as a cat. No one is going to get the two of them confused. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou cat had the name first. Tell Carrie to build a bridge and get the fuck over it.", "nta you name the cat before the baby exists.
