Just because some of us would doesn't mean you need to do so.\n\nETA I can't see the comment to reply, but I had a notification this is in Phoenix. In which case, OP, if you do drop the rent you'll want to keep it at low market rate. If you go below market rate it starts affecting your ability to depreciate the property for tax purposes.
