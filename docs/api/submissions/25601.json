You are correct that you aren't charging them double, they demand that no one have access to the home while they are gone, then they should be paying for it; you still have to pay your mortgage and property taxes, even if you don't use your home. If your siblings are so concerned, then they can offer to pitch in with the payment.", "NTA. Your parents are taking a house that could be producing income for you. If they want exclusive use, they should pay for exclusive use.\n\nIt would be perfectly fair to only charge them for the months they're there if they'd just put their stuff in storage when they move out so you can make money via tenants during those 6 months.\n\nAs far as a discount goes, it would mean you're subsidizing them. That makes sense if you *want* them there, e.g.: for baby sitting. Otherwise, if they think the rent is too high, let them find a place that suits them better. That would actually be the preferred choice, as having business relationships with your family is generally a bad idea.", "NTA. They are taking up space even when not there, you can point out that its storage and place holding fees. Heck if they rented from anybody else they'd be paying year round too", "NTA\n\nIf they want control of the property full time, they need to rent it full time.\n\n\"Market rate\" is often a little nebulous. In the US going to far below it can have tax implications, but \"lane house\" makes me think this isn't the US. But if you're used to the income that market rate brings in you don't have to lower it for them. Just because some of us would doesn't mean you need to do so.", "NTA, based on what's here. It seems silly that they would expect to only pay for the months they're there while also asking you to not rent it when they're not there. If they're not paying for it, it's not their home.\n\nLike, maybe you could bend a little bit on full market rate (unless it's an in-demand property where you're making big bucks, there is inherent value to knowing the place is fully booked and with a tenant you presumably trust rather than rolling the dice on AirBNB), but yeah, if they don't want you to rent it out and see it as \"their home,\" they've got to pay accordingly.", "INFO: What is your financial relationship like otherwise? Do you consider your parents to be generous people, or grifter types? Or something in between?\n\nHave they helped you with things financially since you've been an adult?\n\nDo you truly need the rent money to keep yourself afloat?\n\nYou say \"half the year\", but you also say, \"winters\".

You could though give them a lower rate considering they are your parents and lower risk tenants, so it\u2019s more likely you\u2019ll get paid on time and that your property will br taken care of.", "NTA. If they want exclusive use of the property they can pay for exclusive use of the property. That's how renting works. You aren't charging double rent, you're charging rent. They're trying to take advantage because you're family. \n\nThey can fully vacate the property every six months, they can organise their belongings in the house so it can be rented for the six months they aren't there, they can pay rent for the property they are occupying (they occupy the property even if they themselves aren't physically there).\n\nOr my personal favourite: since they've already proven that they're going to treat your property like something they can control and are entitled to, they've proven they can't be trusted. Don't rent to them at all. Like lending money, renting to family never works out well, especially if it starts with animosity.", "NTA. The profits from the house are part of your income. They cannot ask you to reduce your income. \n\nYou said in another comment that at 18 you were basically told to become financially independent so same goes for them.", "Maybe you could compromise and charge them a lesser rate for the half year they aren't there. Like they aren't doing wear and tear during that time and stuff, but they are preventing others from staying there and using it as storage.  \n\n\nThat or maybe have them contribute to the cost of building a shed on the property and offer to help them move personal effects into storage so you can rent it out as temporary accomodation without them feeling as much that there space and bed and stuff has been violated by strangers?", "NTA", "If you were to rent  from anybody else, not gonna hear any of that nonsense your stuffs there you pay rent. If it's not there, it should be rented out.", "NTA.  They aren't paying double, they're paying for the space they are taking.  They're still responsible for it if you aren't free to rent it out when they aren't there.  In the end it looks like it will be tough to make them happy and you'd be better off letting your generous siblings take them in.", "NTA\n\nThey can rent another home instead.. they don't have to live in your home and you lose out on 6 months worth of rent.\n\nIf your siblings are so incensed about it... they can rent their second homes to the parents instead.... but let me guess they either don't want to lose out on 6 months worth of income... or they don't have one.\n\nDon't mix business with family.  It never ends well.  If you do end up leasing the property to them, you need an iron clad contract (get a proper legal person to draw it up) and let a real estate agent/property manager manage it.  Because if you give an inch... they'll take a mile and before long they'll be living for free with you covering all the bills.\n\nYou are just being the good business person they expected when they threw you out of the family nest to find your way....", "ESH Them because they are TA in this situation \n\nYou because you need to work on your communication and maths.\n\n1 x \u201cpaying rent for the whole time that you wish to have exclusive possession of the house\u201d = 1 rent.\n\nThere is no double about it.

They want to live the snowbird lifestyle, they need to realize that that comes with downsides, like having to either pay rent on two places or having to rent month to month and pack up and move their stuff with them when they head out.", "Or they'd have to rent month to month and take their stuff with them (or put it in storage) when they leave.

The entitlement will only increase.", "In some ways, not having anyone there for the half-year is *worse* than having someone there--no one handling the yard, no one making sure that things are running properly.
