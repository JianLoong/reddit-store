My son doesn't see his mother, Alice(39f), very often, as she will only see him when he is visiting his grandparents, as she lives with her parents. I have a pretty good relationship with his grandparents, and they have helped me out a lot. My son stays with his grandparents (60s) during most of the summer, and he will see them a couple times during the year.  \nLast spring, I had to move abroad for work, so my son stayed with his grandparents June, July, August. This is the most amount of time he has spent with his mother. I don't have the best relationship with his mother. She is a fine person, but not the best parent, as she doesn't make an effort to spend time with our son, and when she does, she will constantly bad mouth me in front of him. I got back from my work at the beginning of August, and my son spent the rest of the summer with me.  \nMy son told me, that he has asked his mother if he could shave his arms and legs, as he didn't like the feel of the hair on them. Alice had gotten mad at him, telling him that boys shouldn't shave their arms and legs, and that it was \"unmanly,\" and that it was a \"sissy\" thing to do. She also told him that I would be mad at him if he did it. My son decided to do it anyways, and to just wearing long sleeve shirts and sweatpants that rest of the time he was there. My son had believed his mother, when she said that I would be mad, but still wanted to tell me. I told him I could never be mad at him for that, and that if shaving his arms and legs was what made him feel better, he could do it.  \nFast forward to now, it's been a few months, and my son has continued shaving his arms and legs. He hasn't seem his mother since the summer, so she still doesn't know. Yesterday, we had gone and visited some of my family, for thanksgiving. I was talking to my siblings, and my sister (38f) made a comment about my son not having hair on his arms. I don't have a good relationship with my sister, and she will always make comments about the way I raise my son. She was making jokes and laughing, asking me how my son didn't have arm hair. I told her that he just shaves it off. My sister started flipping out, saying that guys shouldn't shave their arms, and all that sort of stuff. I had had enough, and decided to just leave early.  \nToday, Alice messages me, asking how could I let him shave his arms and legs. My sister was friends with her, and told her what had happened. She started going off at me, saying I was a terrible parent, and that I should never have let my son do it. I told her that it was his body, and if he wanted to shave he could. We went back and forth for quite some time. Eventually she said that she was his parent too, and that she got to make decisions as well. I said that if she had wanted to make decisions, she should have been more in his life, and not only show up when her parents make her.\n\nAITA for letting my son shave?", "created_utc": 1700954477, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183wj36/aita_for_letting_my_son_shave/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your ex and sister enforcing that idea that men shaving is \u201csissy\u201d or \u201cunmanly\u201d is such a sexist remark and absolutely not okay and is what creates toxic men.
