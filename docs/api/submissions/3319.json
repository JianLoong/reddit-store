Reporting his behavior would practically be an act of public service.", "Gripe water is pretty much TUMS for children, but it's in liquid form and also includes herbs like ginger and chamomile. Our pediatrician told us before her first flight at 4 months old that the change in pressures while flying doesn't just hurt infant's ears but can also cause an uncomfortable feeling of bloating/swelling in their stomachs and that gripe water can help relieve it. 10/10 would recommend. I'm gonna include a link to the brand we use, it's been a lifesaver! My husband also used it in a pinch when we were out of Pepto and it helped settle his stomach. It's not just for kids!\n\n\n\nhttps://www.littleremedies.com/remedies/stomach-gas-remedies/little-remedies-gripe-water-chamomile", "My family and I travel frequently and I grew up traveling a lot, as well. While I can empathize that kids can be unpredictable in the best of times, my husband and I have made it a point to teach our kid how to be a respectful traveler. I've been on flights where parents let their kids run wild and it fucking sucks. I don't want to judge or shame other parents since I don't know what they're going through, but now that our kid is old enough, my husband and I talk with our kid before traveling and outline appropriate behavior (obviously in child-friendly terms). We will also never hesitate to correct her behavior if she's being disruptive to other passengers. It's what my parents did with me when I was a kid and it worked well for them so we're just using their model and it's worked great for us, as well.", "Wheny son was sent overseas, his company booked him, wife and boys (2 and 4 months) in first class. Kids were great. No one said a word.", "I agree.", "THIS. But unfortunately these kind of people really don't know how to be happy and their only way to live is to be angry/upset AND live to make others miserable as well. NTA", "Even if your kiddo struggled for any length of time, first class isn't sound proof from economy. If he wants to be undisturbed, fly private. You spent the extra money for your comfort, so can he.", "Omg yes, what an absolutely rude, unhinged thing to say to you. No question that was unnecessary. \n\nIt\u2019s funny, I was just upgraded to first class on a shorter flight, and someone had their baby on their lap. It never occurred to me to be upset about that lol. Also the kid was like yours, well behaved and super cute.", "I may be a petty bitch, but I refuse to subject anyone to a toddler meltdown lol no one wants to deal with a screaming baby on an airplane.", "It\u2019s one thing when it\u2019s cross country. Out of line. But I\u2019m an enclosed space where they were targeted three times, valid reason.", "Careful; that\u2019s the hard stuff!"]}
