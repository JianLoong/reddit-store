Since we could afford it due to a nice pay raise my husband recently got, we decided to splurge on 1st class tickets for the trip.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: My toddler has always been a good flyer and has flown a lot throughout her short life. We follow our pediatrician recommendation to give her a dose of baby Tylenol and gripe water 30 minutes before travel and she's never been disruptive or cried on an airplane, this flight included. She's good at staying in her seat and tells us when she a needs to go potty, food, a toy, etc. She stayed seated and quietly playing throughout the flight, only getting up when she had to go potty.\n\n\n\n\nThe issue was withanother 1st class passenger. We boarded early since my husband is disabled and when another 1st class passenger saw us he started glaring. Shortly after he sat down a flight attendant came up and asked to see our boarding passes to make sure we were seated correctly. We showed her our boarding passes and she was like \"cool, yall are good\". A few minutes later a second flight attendant came up and asked again to see our boarding passes. We showed them and again she was like \"cool yall are good\". We take off and all is good. My kid fell asleep in the middle of coloring, husband is snoozing, I'm listening to music when I get a tap on my shoulder. It was the guy that glared at us as he boarded and before I could even get a word out he told me that children weren't allowed in 1st class and that we needed to move to our \"real\" seats. I realized he was probably the person that complained before takeoff that we were in the wrong seats and decided before I got upset I wanted the flight attendants to deal with this. I told him that I did not feel comfortable talking with him and that I was calling a flight attendant to come handle this. He got flustered but ultimately stood awkwardly next to me in the aisle until a flight attendant came to clear things up.\n\nThe flight attendant came and explained to him that we were in the correct seats that we paid for and asked that he sit back down and not bother us again. He did go back to his seat but as we were getting off the plane he whispered to me that I was a \"fat cunt\" and that he pays too much money for first class to be surrounded by children. My kid was the only kid in 1st class and she didn't misbehave or even cry so at first I felt like I was in the right, but after talking to family at Thanksgiving many of them told me that we should book economy next time because people pay extra to relax in 1st class.

Woodward took his inspiration from the treatments for malaria and \"fen fever\". He noted that the formula used to treat fen fever was an effective \"soother of fretful babies and provided relief from gastrointestinal troubles in infants.\" The original Woodward's Gripe Water contained 3.6% alcohol, dill oil, sodium bicarbonate, sugar, and water. Woodward registered \"Gripe Water\" as a trademark in 1876. It was initially marketed with the slogan \"Granny told Mother and Mother told me.\"[5] The modern era formula for Woodward's Gripe water does not contain alcohol or sugar.\n\n> Prior to alcohol's removal from the recipe, Woodward's maximum recommended dose of gripe water contained an alcohol content equivalent to five tots of whiskey for an 80kg adult. It was only in 1992 that Britain mandated that alcohol be removed from Gripe water, and in 1993 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered an automatic detention of all shipments of Woodward's Gripe Water into the U.S. on the basis of its being an unapproved drug.[7][8] In response to the FDA's import alert, gripe water products are sold as dietary supplements.[5]", "This is how virtually every single research study of the long-term effects of a low-grade intervention works, especially on children.

Sure maybe I might have preferred to just watch my movie without interruptions, but I will absolutely play a little peek-a-boo if it means we can all avoid 8 hours of screaming. \n\n(Her parents were keeping an eye on her and overall everyone around us seemed happy to have her wander a bit down the aisle for the same reason. Everyone needs to stretch their legs, kids included.)", "That super sucks. Every flight I've taken with them does Family Boarding between A and B group. Anyone with kids.... just not sure what the cutoff age for kids is for them!", "Hate cattle call boarding. Add to that, I\u2019m not sure where they get their reputation as a low cost carrier. I always check and it\u2019s cheaper to fly a major airline and pay for baggage fees than fly them with their free bags and I get to pick my seat ahead of time and boarding is so much less stressful.  I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m the last one on the plane cause my seat is waiting for me.", "Before I was a mom my self I was on a flight with a mom and her four year old traveling alone.  I read to the kid and chatted with her while the mom had a Bloody Mary. The mom was grateful and I had fun and the kid behaved better for a stranger. \n\nNow I\u2019m a mom who travels with my own kid and haven\u2019t had that level of kindness from a stranger yet but have definitely had a few older women compliment my child when it was clear I was stressed, which I really appreciated.", "iirc you have to be traveling with a kid age 6 or under", "I also go to a lot of art museums and galleries, and museums in particular almost always have reduced or free admission for children. Odd, if it\u2019s not a proper environment for children to learn and explore in, no?\n\nOf course kids can\u2019t run around touching art, but you kinda need to take them places to teach them how to behave in them.", "I never said it\u2019s not a proper environment for children to learn or explore. One of the small museums I volunteered at (a historic house) had a designated children\u2019s room with material for younger kids to touch/read/color. No one, including children, could touch artifacts in the other rooms, except the gift shop.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not saying they shouldn\u2019t go to places like museums or theaters or the vet. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s the parents\u2019 responsibility to teach them how to behave appropriately in those spaces. My parents taught me that it wasn\u2019t appropriate to run and scream everywhere long before I went to any of those types of places though.", "Every comment just makes me want to sit next to a baby more. Manspreading and milk drunk? Sounds like a highly entertaining and adorable way to spend the flight. I can bounce off the tiny baby rolls if there\u2019s turbulence.", "YTA\n\nYou can afford 3 cross country seats first class in this country. That makes YTA because you have too much money and are contributing to wealth disparity. But probably not what you are looking for", "Exactly. If he can afford 1st class then he can afford for some good quality noise cancelling headphones. His comfort is not anybody else's responsibility but his.", "I literally JUST had this happen to us on our last cross country flight. They sat my husband and I together, and put my (almost) two year old son- which was listed on the ticket we purchased as infant in seat, hello?!- in a seat three rows behind us. Took 20 minutes at the gate computer to fix before the flight. Absolutely bonkers.", "You do know studies can be conducted via surveys?", "Some people\u2019s drug of choice is outrage.", "Sorry but a toddler crying is ear piercing especially in a small space, your kids are not someone elses problem.  If you know your kid is a bad flyer, take economy.  Even noise cancelling headphones cannot drone out an ear piercing cry.  In Ops case sounds like she knows her kid flies fine so 1st class is not an issue,", "It's one of these things that make me happy to be in the EU. There are loads of passenger protections, so if your airline cancels your flight and it delays you significantly (at least 3 hours iirc), they have to issue compensation.", "That\u2019s good for you but I can\u2019t sleep for shit on an airplane. Whether in first class or economy. I do think parents should be honest with themselves if they have a kid who is well behaved enough to be flying or if they\u2019re going to inflict hours of loud annoying noises for everyone else.", "Wrong. You never know whether or not your kid is going to cry for certain, and you don't owe anyone around you more than your best effort to keep a child quiet. You have a right to fly with a toddler in whatever seats you want.", "I flew out to see see a friend on United.   When I said that I needed to pick up checked luggage, she was horrified: \"You checked luggage when you were flying United!  Don't you know never to do that!\"   Yeah, they lost the luggage, although it showed up a few hours later.   Fortunately, I did have necessities, like my medication, in my carry on.", "Yeah, no. I have heard a childfree person (she mentioned it) bitching about my son when he was quietly minding his own business, in a space that belonged to friends of mine (ie not her place, not her rules). I've literally had someone try to object to the presence of my son IN MY HOUSE.  I've encountered that attitude plenty.", "While even massive creeps can have their boundaries, I agree, it's unlikely that would be the thing to stop him.", "No one says you don't have the right but if you are a considerate human being you would not put a toddler you know cries in first class.  That is called being selfish, the parents don't want to sacrifice their comfort while ruining the flight for everyone else.", "Hehe, that's one of my favourite bits too! When he bends over and puts his hand on it :D", "Are you saying that every childfree person is like that? I\u2019ve encountered rude parents, does that mean every parent is rude?", "Nobody said every CF person is like that. You were the one who made the claim that basically none of them are, which is clearly untrue for anyone who can read and has been to that subreddit.", "LOL. I'm not falling for that very transparent attempt to deflect.", "I was on a long flight one time.    An older woman was walking around the plane with a baby to soothe her.   Grandmother, I thought.  Then a second woman came around with the same baby.   Big family trip, I thought, both grandmothers.   Then a third woman.   I forget how many women came around with that baby, but I finally asked, and it turned out that none of the women were relatives.   They were just kindly taking turns keeping baby happy.", "This exactly. You paid for the seats, end of story. NTA", "This is a typical rude/entitled attitude of people who value money over manners. Just because we can afford to do something, it does not automatically mean that it's all right. No one is disputing whether this person has the *right* to book a small child in first class, but whether she and her husband are thoughtless for doing so.\n\nPeople have become less and less concerned with the comfort of others, and merely concerned with what they are entitled to do, everyone else be damned. I have a child, and I am well aware of the fact that not everyone thinks she is a little darling and should welcome her into what should rightly remain adult spaces, therefore, I do not impose her upon other people in such situations.\n\nWe would all be better off if people thought less about what they \"have a right\" to do, and thought more about what is the thoughtful and polite thing to do.", "I actually disagree about it being okay to be entitled to seats if you have a disruptive child. This dude was a complete asshole. But first class is a rare treat (or even a once in a lifetime one) and if a child is crying in it, that really extra sucks. I fly a lot. I fly economy. I expect crying children (and there almost always are). I am not upset at all about that, but I admittedly would be if it was first class. I don\u2019t care if they bought the tickets. That doesn\u2019t automatically give them a right to ruin a very rare luxury for others.", "Problem is being away from children wasn't a perk from those tickets, if the airline doesn't have a minimal age for 1st class. He paid good money for extra room, bigger seats, better services. But being away from children wasn't something he was entitled to.", "It's even more selfish to not be accommodating and understanding of kids that are just kids. They're developing and learning to control themselves. It's completely unreasonable to expect kids to be behaved 100% of the time and also to expect public transportation to exclude kids", "I stand by my opinion that no, they are not \"thoughtless\"  nor are they the asshole. \n\nI feel it would be easier to calm a crying child in first class with more space and comfort. maybe the polite thing to do it TO book first class and only disrupt the 20 people there as apposed to the 100 in economy.  disrupt only the minority instead of he masses", "And if they\u2019re not, then what? They shouldn\u2019t fly? There are definitely ways you can mitigate the noise, but at the end of the day, kids are people and should be allowed on planes and other public spaces. The guy should have flown private, if kids are that annoying to him.", "She should definitely sit next to my husband. He is the baby Junkie. I am not so good with kids but even I will take a baby or a toddler away from a parent and play with it for a while so the parent can get settled. It's just normal human interaction.", "\ud83d\ude2d we had a flight with our almost 2 year old and 2 month old last year right before Thanksgiving to go to my grandfather's funeral. And the amount of hate I got for having my newborn on the flight was unreal, save for the sweet lady I sat next to who helped me get situated and comfortable, and even helped me with my drink during the flight.", "I wish I could give you an award for this! I've had to travel with both my kids twice by myself and the few times that someone offered to help me were a blessing as I had paid for extra help from the airline (I am also physically disabled) and was told I was SOL because they didn't have enough staff.", "Thanks, it was a lovely and rewarding experience. I simply didn't want my own children, for good reasons, involving my nuclear family. To my surprise, little kids gravitated to me, and I enjoyed them. This particular situation was a challenge, & (35+  yrs later), I'm pleased that my (late 20s) self said \"get over it and help two fellow humans.\" My husband was seated a few rows back. After we landed in London, my husband & I accompanied mom & infant, helped with her carry on luggage, went with them to baggage claim, etc, saw to their safety until she & little one were met. It was a good karma experience, all around, but especially for me. Still remember how sweet it was to nap, with this little boy held securely, and he was totally relaxed, trustingly, in my arms. I am so grateful to revisit this memory.", "Where do you live? Where I'm from children under 10 aren't allowed to be outside of economy because of crying. YTA in my opinion because alot of places do this....also I doubt that this story is true since toddlers cry 24/7 so she was probably crying. I mean he couldn't have came up to you for no reason, yes?", "I am not aware of any commercial airline banning children under a certain age from any class. However, if they did, it couldn\u2019t be the airline in OP\u2019s case. \n\nWhen one books tickets for kids, one must provide the ages of any children, as well as their names and birthdays. This is because there are safety rules, both for the aircraft (e.g. prevent kids blocking emergency exits) and for the child (prevent human trafficking). \n\nA child as young as OP\u2019s would also probably need a special seat (should parents choose buy one - under two they can also just sit on laps), or seatbelt addition for sitting on a parent\u2019s lap during takeoff and landing (depending on jurisdiction). \n\nThen, at checkin and/or boarding, IDs must be shown, even in jurisdictions where an adult might not need to show ID (a flight within the Schengen area for example), again for security and anti-human trafficking rules. \n\nIn short, I\u2019ve never heard of an airline banning babies from any particular class, but if one did, the airline would see at the time of sale and prior to boarding that OP\u2019s baby is an actual baby, and would have acted at that time.\n\nI guessing that the antagonist doesn\u2019t fly a great deal, for while babies aren\u2019t very common fliers at all, they do sometime also fly first and business class. \n\nIf anything, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn that  that they fly those classes more than economy, when parents can afford it. There were definitely flights when I could have propped up against a window and made it work in economy on my own, but where a lie-flat seat made all the difference to my toddler.\n\nNTA. OP did nothing wrong and the antagonist confused their own limited experience with comprehensive knowledge. Once, the flight attendant established that OP and her family were in the right place, he should have accepted his error and shut up.", "Exactly. I personally would hateeee if I paid first class to have a disruptive kid there but that would be my own internal problem to deal with, lucky they provide headphones and ear plugs in first class fi you forget your own!", "Oh, no, I've had to fly next to a muttering creep too.  In coach, but, yes, these people do exist.  How DARE people they don't want to look at be in THEIR line of sight on this commercially owned mass conveyance that apparently exists solely for THEM.", "I once spent a 16-hour flight in the middle section of three seats, I had one aisle seat, a small baby was in the middle, and a parent was on the other side. It was *lovely* because I never had to get up to let the person in the middle out! Also I got both arm rests. It was almost better than having an empty seat, because there was no risk of someone else coming along wanting to sit there.", "I was going to say this, except substitute \"entitled AH\" for \"grown up child\".", "Agreed. That man would find a stump to argue with if it was female and he thought he could get away with it. Look to his calling her a c\\*\\*\\*\\*.

Two different airlines, both required it.", "Not sure about Europe, but British Airways is particularly bad about this.\n\nAFAIK unless you're flying with a child under two, or have sufficient Executive Club status, advance seat assignments aren't free, and can cost as much as a few hundred pounds.", "Pre booked even\nLol", "> But I can guarantee Air Canada's business class is better than any of the big three American carriers' top cabins.\n\nIf you get a 3-class plane, the U.S. airlines provide good service.
