He said he wanted to go but his SO is unable to leave her dog for long periods of time (senior dog who refuses to eat if she's not home). He thought I may want to take a look at it.\n\nI did and it was a damn good deal for visiting countries I've always wanted to see. But you have to get two tickets to get the deal. \nI tried inviting friends but no one was able to afford it or get the time off.\n\nSo I asked my dad if he would be interested in going. This was quite literally something we had talked about doing when I was a teenager so it seemed too perfect. He said to give him some time to ask his SO if it was ok and time went on.\n\nA week or so later he called me to say that it looks like he can go, most excellent. And so planning for excursions and whatnot begins.\n\nThen another week later I was picking him up for a doctor's appointment and he told me that his SO changed her mind. She didn't want him to go on a trip that she wants to go on but can't and said that couples don't take vacations separately and if he went then they'd have to reconsider their relationship.\nWhich can I just say, the fuck? \n\nOver the next couple weeks I would get texts from my dad about how he's been trying to calm her down or discuss it which makes it sound like tensions are rising in their household which makes me feel guilty for instigating it.\n\nSo now I'm hurt, pissed off and feeling guilty so I decided to call it off and cancel the trip. \nI told my dad that I cancelled it and I guess he told her and now she's crying and I'm crying and this is all just so goddamn stupid. I don't understand why it bothers me so much, if I had any acting ability this would be amazing because now I can cry on cue just thinking about the situation. \nI made that joke to my dad and I'm regretting it because every now and then he brings it up just for me to start crying just to see if it still works. \n\nFor Christmas he got me a suitcase... and it took everything I had to smile and be respectful and say thank you because I couldn't tell if it was intentional or not.\nAnd then when he and his SO dropped me off at my place and I was taking it out of the trunk he asked if the gift made me happy or sad and I just started to cry again. Which freaked out my dad's SO because I never cry and she didn't hear what he said. I just rushed into my apartment and I haven't talked to him since. \n\nHe invited me to meet up today to get food so I'm going to ask him what the fuck all that was about.\n\nIt's just wild to me that all this is from a goddamn vacation.\n\nSo AITA for inviting my dad on a cruise?", "created_utc": 1704482788, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zf66b/aita_for_inviting_my_dad_on_a_cruise/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Couples absolutely can travel separately, especially if its a trip with your kid\n\nEdit - your dad bringing this up periodically to make you cry is incredibly concerning behavior. Hes a huge AH for that", "NTA  - so is your Dad never to go on vacation because of her pet?  That is ridiculous.  It's the perfect opportunity for a dad/daughter bonding moment.  Yes, couples can go on vacation without each other.  Some people can't be happy for others - she's grounded due to her pet so in her mind your Dad must be too.  That's just selfish.", "NTA but your's dad's SO is a giant A H: robbing the person she (supposedly) loves from a once-in-a-lifetime experience he could have shared with his kid", "NTA, but IMHO opinion your dad sure is for intentionally making you cry, not once but several times. And the suitcase thing? The whole thing doesn't make sense. Has he always seen cruelty are funny?\n\nI get that many people are overly protective of their pets. But his SO has a real problem if she wants to tie him to her drama. At first this sounded like a great family, you and your dad taking a once in a lifetime trip. at the end it sounds like they both need some professional help.\n\nEdit: if you're weird for inviting or wanting to travel with a parent so are a whole bunch of other people! My parents both loved to travel but were terrible together so I took many trips with my mother or my father. He brought it up, he said he's like to go. What's wrong with that?", "Absolutely NTA!!! It's completely okay and normal for a parent and their kid to go on a trip together, it would be wonderful bonding time for you both. It's obvious the SO is insecure and controlling. It also seems like your dad is having a hard time trying to navigate the situation. I'm sorry this is happening, that's so upsetting and you have every right to be upset, angry and confused. I think anyone would get overwhelmed with this much back and forth", "NTA but your dad\u2019s partner is the AH. She can\u2019t go, fine. But going out of your way to make sure your partner can\u2019t have a special time with their daughter is next level of assholery.", "NTA. but your dad is an AH. Why is he letting his SO rule his life? He should have stood up for you and joined you on this amazing cruise. The SO also sucks with her selfishness. You tried to do an amazing thing OP; so sorry that it didn't work out.\n\nAnd what's with luggage as a gift? It's like they are sticking it to you. \n\nAnd pet dog trumps daughter. Yeesh.", "NTA - The fact that SO was initially OK with it shows that you're not in the wrong. If this was such an outlandishly offensive idea, she wouldn't have initially agreed.", "NTA and whilst it may be unconventional for couples to go on holidays separately, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going with his friends he\u2019d be going with you, his child! I think it\u2019s lovely that you wanted to do that for him knowing it was something he really wanted and personally I don\u2019t think he should have asked her for permission.", "NTA.\n\nDad's SO is a piece of work driving that wedge between you both.", "NTA - I know plenty of parents that will take a vacation with their adult child even some who do it without the other parent despite still being in a happy relationship. His SO seems to like drama too much. And you didn't instigate drama, she did.", "NTA - your Dad\u2019s SO is the AH. She got FOMO (fear of missing out) and threw an adult temper tantrum because she chooses to stay home with her dog.", "NTA. In the last 10 years I (60M) I have done cruises with my Dad. I have done cruises with my married adult daughter. Obviously I\u2019ve done cruises and many vacations with my spouse (not daughter\u2019s bio mom). \n\nI enjoy a solo week away every year since 2015. My wife takes a week as well to go to an all inclusive with her gf. \n\nNone of these choices is wrong and none are damaging to any other relationship. \n\nYour father\u2019s SO is a clutching, prig of a woman. \n\nNone of this is", "NTA I guess to me the idea that you can't go on a trip w/o your SO is just odd because my parents did that. Not frequently and typically it was taking one kid on a trip and not the other (because my mom and I believe camping is staying in a 1 star hotel and my dad and sister actually like sleeping in a tent. I'm not convinced we're related.)", "Absolutely NTA, you just wanted share a wonderful experience with your father.  His SO is so insecure that she decided to crap all over.   If I was not able to go,  I would never stand in the way of my husband traveling with our daughter. This sounds like an amazing trip.  Is there any way you guys can still do it?", "This was about a grown man wanting to spend sometime with his daughter. That the SO behaved childishly is ridiculous. Her reasoning is also pretty childish. \n\nNo reason the two of them cant go on a trip after elderly dog goes to the great dog park in the sky. \n\nYour father needs to pull up his big boy pants and seriously think about this. \n\nNTA", "NTA at all, maybe you should distance yourself from their weird dynamic for a bit. SO clearly is making this about her, she freaked out at you showing emotions and neither thought to go after you and talk through it. \n\nI have an older dog with issues and would never make others revolve their life around it. \n\nSending hugs!", "NTA\n\nYour dad seems to be with some kind of manipulative person/an abuser. I'd ask him if she treats him poorly on other occasions. It's totally normal for people who are in a couple to go on a holiday the other person isn't joining in on. People have different friend groups, different schedules, different physical abilities, different places they want to see. Your father's partner is a total ahole here.\n\nI don't understand the suitcase gift. Did you ask for it? Did your dad pick it out or his partner?", "NTA. \n\nI've been taking my (not-yet-adult) kids one at a time on fun little trips over the years. I'd have no problem if my husband did the same, even as our kids become adults.\n\nI went on a few trips with my mom as well, and I'd give anything to have my dad alive to go on a cruise with him and have some one-on-one time.", "NTA - The SO is missing the point: An adult child and their dad should go on vacation. He can also take vacations with her. It's not all or nothing but rather both. I am so sorry. What a wonderfully wasted opportunity. Acknowledge the tears; no need keeping them in. We are on the earth a short time. Find your joy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Sounds to me like your dad's wife is jealous plain and simple and now she's upset because she knows she's wrong and looks like the bad guy. Odds are she tried talking to people about it and they all said she was being unreasonable and now she's mad she's the bad guy. Please update with how this plays out I can't imagine this is over yet", "NTA.  WTF?  OP's dad and his SO deserve each other.  SO won't leave her dog, so Dad can't go on vacation?  That's really a selfish move, and she's an AH.  But Dad keeps prodding OP for fun to see if he can make her cry?  Giving OP a suitcase for Xmas, and then prodding OP AGAIN to make her cry about it!?  Looks like he was expecting tears when OP opened it, and was disappointed when she didn't, so he upped the pressure by asking about it.  This is not what a loving relationship looks like, and Dad's a major AH.  OP should send him a \"Parenting for Dummies\" book.\n\nI'd cut both those AHs out of my life and go on a vacation without talking to either of them about it.  Then I'd post a selfie of myself on a beach or at a famous tourist site, sitting on that f-ing suitcase.", "NTA My parents (in their 70s) been on several separate vacations over the years, sometimes with a friend / friends, a sports club or with me. It was never a big deal. Couples don't need to stick together at all times to be a couple.", "NTA. It's perfectly reasonable to ask your dad to go with you on a trip you both want to take. Your dad and his SO though... it's real AH behavior to keep bringing it up just to make you cry, and if that gift was deliberate that's even worse, so he is absolutely TA. And his SO is *also* TA for refusing to let him go just because she can't. Does she expect him to never travel just because her dog is sick for however many years the dog has left? That's absurd. Sounds like it might be a good time to take a break from talking to your dad for a bit, until you feel better and until he learns not to be a jerk to you about this.", "You don\u2019t think he\u2019s a total ass for bring it up in various ways, just to watch her cry?\n\nThe SO may be wrong, but her dad is cruel.  Nothing he did was by accident.", "Ngl, getting OP a suitcase for Christmas feels like pouring more salt on that wound. I cannot imagine why he thought that gift was a good idea. I think he's enjoying this. Maybe he loves how devastated she is by not being able to go with him. Like some twisted \"look how much my daughter loves me\" kind of sentiment.", "[deleted]", "What?
