In future, I will try to be more clear but I also ask that you don't make negative comments on my coffee choices, okay?\" \n\n\n\n\n*Before someone says it, yes statistically autisitic people are not the \"norm\" but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt to hear you're \"abnormal\".", "[removed]", "this is the way. he's autistic. bluntly explaining the truth to him is the way to go. he'll internalize that so much easier and more fully than being made fun of. he probably didn't realize he was being rude and will be devestated he came off that way. if he's not upset with himself for missing the cues, and making you feel bad then he's the ass hole. otherwise NAH", "Yeah, if anything, he should have apologised and explained that it wasn\u2019t personal, it was just his special interest, and that he will try his best to not repeat the behaviour in the future now that he knows it makes her uncomfortable. It could have been a moment about the importance of communicating boundaries clearly to him and a positive reset from the day the before.", "THIS!", ">You don't know if I am autistic and D.D. is my safe food.\n\nLOL, yes, this would be PERFECT.", "I came to say this. My husband and I are pretty into coffee, and would totally tease one another about getting \u201cbad coffee\u201d something like \u201cwow, you must have really needed coffee to get it from there!\u201d But would never do that to someone else. We did however rate all the convenience store coffee in order from best to worst and I\u2019ve had someone ask me which convenience store they should go to if they\u2019re just getting black coffee lol so I like to think we\u2019re helpful in our obsession.", "I\u2019m like you honestly, I love coffee, I\u2019m snobby about it FOR MYSELF and I don\u2019t really give a fuck what other people drink. There\u2019s a Dunkin around the corner from my office and my coworkers go there sometimes (mostly cause it\u2019s the cheapest place in midtown NYC). They invite me sometimes. I say no thank you. It\u2019s really that easy.\n\nBut I do agree with the coworker that Dunkin coffee is fucking disgusting (where is the coffee flavor??? It is brown water) and I would never drink it.", "especially when Parker was bean such a massive AH.", "I see what you did there  lol", "Going to concur with this considering at a much earlier stage of my life I was the \"Parker\" but I had a good boss and excellent understanding coworkers who helped me be me whilst guiding me to better understand that I may need to limit some of my passions around others as they may not be interested at all in the same things. \n\nI will also concur that being told your abnormal does indeed cut deep, you will never be normal no matter how hard you try or mask and you will have to accept that people will notice that and call you out for it as they will not know your difference. \n\nEven if there's no further interaction going forward the op is NTA however an olive branch apology with the condition of \"I will always point out when you're taking shit too far\" I know I would appreciate that situation as that's what I got. But again that's not your job and doesn't change the NTA either way if you choose not to.", "Autism is not an excuse to be rude. Though I wouldn\u2019t suggest he is faking his autism for \u201cconvenience\u201d.", "I like this solution", "She didn\u2019t know he was autistic", "You do know that OP is the one who wrote this, not Parker, right? So Parker has no way of knowing you're telling him to leave OP alone.", "he wasn\u2019t just trying to share something, he was actively being a dick. Being autistic doesn\u2019t excuse this stuff. I\u2019m autistic, I\u2019m well aware that we can be insufferable when we don\u2019t know when to quit talking, idk how he hasn\u2019t learned that yet, or how he got a job like this", "i thought that too until op mentioned that he has coffee making materials at the office", "That was my first thought too. This was a misguided and creepy attempt at flirting.", "I honestly thought this myself as I read it :(", "As a counterpoint, as someone who also has a lot of special interests and poor social skills, I'll still argue that Parker is being too sensitive here.\n\nI've been told multiple times that it's \"not normal\" to be as obsessed as I am about some things. Do you know when I'm told that? It's when I'm not getting the hint that it's time to shut up about my interests. I don't take it as a personal attack against me or my interest; I recognize that they're (correctly) saying that it's not a good thing to keep talking about your interests when nobody's interested.\n\nInstead of OP apologizing, she should probably explain to Parker that she wasn't insulting his interest, but rather returning his teases and making it very clear she was no longer interested in hearing about how much he was judging her choice of coffee.", "The OP, apologizing to Patrick after he repeatedly insulted her? Well, if she doesn't respect herself the slightest bit, that might be an option.\n\nPolitely informing him her response was about his harassing behavior rather than his tastes is one thing\u00a0\u2014 the right thing to do. *Apologizing* after he verbally pissed all over her tastes, which were none of his business in the first place? Only after he apologizes first for being an AH to her.", "I disagree. I have autism, it does hurt to be told you're abnormal, but OP said it's not normal to be this \"intense\" not \"you're abnormal\". If he hadn't been so rude all day then it wouldn't have even come to that. OP doesn't need to apologise - if I were Parker, I'd take it as another social lesson in the seemingly endless cues and whateverisms I seem to miss all the time. He needs to realise that his behaviour didn't come off as he wanted and take something from that. It sucks but just because we have autism it doesn't mean we can just stop trying to learn social skills and become stagnant and rude people. And I speak from experience, it's HARD but you have to keep learning.\n\nUltimately, if you think OP should apologise for miscommunicating then so should Parker x10 because he was being nasty all day and OP said one thing after reaching their limit that wasn't even rude, just short which most people would be at that point. Autism isn't an excuse, it may help explain things but you don't use it to get out of jail free so to speak.", "The thing about normal is that it is actually statistically very abnormal to actually be normal.", "Yes, this! Make it clear you weren\u2019t intending to disrespect his special interest, your only issue was that he kept pestering you about your own preferences. Even his offer to make you a coffee was tinged with insult, that\u2019s what\u2019s the issue.", "Great response", "The way you are directing her to speak to him sounds like someone speaking to a particularly dumb and sensitive child, not an adult co-worker.\n\nOP did not say anything rude or impolite. They were trying to fob off Parker's harassment by making a joke about it.", "Over here! We've got a bot! Found one!", "I am super into coffee. And tea. I like everything particular. \n\nThat doesn't give anyone the right to berate you. There's ways to share a passion like that without scolding someone for their tastes - everyone likes different things.", "This is the way. It's one thing to be helpful in your obsession, but quite another to demean other people who don't share it.\n\nYou've dangled it out there, and now I'm curious - care to share what your top 5 convenience store coffees are?", "Actual conversation between me and Mrs. Baka (she doesn't drink coffee) on a long drive:\n\nMrs.: Do you want a cup of coffee? There's a Dunkin' at the next exit, they have coffee.\n\nMe:  I can wait.\n\nI know there are tons of folks who like it, but I'm not one of them.", "I am genuinely curious here. Not trying to \u201cgotcha\u201d here or anything.\n\nI understand that people on the spectrum can experience difficulties social cues and/or reigning in their special interests, and can sometimes be blunt with their phrasing. But in Parker\u2019s case, I\u2019m having difficulty understanding how he would not find things like \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know good coffee if it hit you in the face\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re crazy for drinking that trash\u201d as anything but mean or rude.\n\nLike it would be one thing if he just, I dunno, rambled on about what coffee beans he finds the highest quality, or his top 5 coffee places, but he didn\u2019t do that.\n\nIMO, if you feel like something you\u2019re interested in makes it okay to insult someone to their face like that, I would also consider it abnormal, neurodivergent or not.\n\nHow does someone on the spectrum process speaking to someone in this manner?", "I agree. OP is NTA but could apologize for using the word not normal, on condition that the guy first apologizes for antagonizing her over her coffee choice.", "Exactly. Not OP\u2019s job. Google is Parker\u2019s friend. He can read all about how to stop being inappropriate at work.", "I had to read your sentence a bunch of times to figure out you were using \"people\" as a verb.", "Op snapped at the coworker when the coworker was simply emphasizing their quirky like of coffee....OP could've just said \"no thanks I'm good\" instead they implied the coworker was weird \".... it's not normal....\" Oh yes it is normal to be a coffee savant... perfectly.", "I didn't say that it excused him. I acknowledged it was an awkward communication that made OP feel uncomfortable. That's not OK. However, I am approaching the situation with a level of empathy for *all* parties and explaining how it may have occurred so that it might be avoided in the future. I would have really benefited from some compassion when I was developing social skills at a slower rate than other people (I still benefit from compassion when I get it wrong now). As for \"idk how he hasn't learned that yet\", you must be aware that not every autistic person is able to develop or use the same set of skills? And that one of the ways we develop is by people telling us we got it wrong? Hence me suggesting she explain to him that she felt uncomfortable, so he has that data for the future.", "I am not drinking anything someone that intense gives me.", "Lmao hr my coworker noticed my coffee cup, arrest him for rape.", "NTA he has to learn boundaries", "Yeah, my first reaction was that he was, very, very awkwardly, hitting on OP.\n\nDoesn't seem like that, though.", "I mean, I'm somewhat familiar with the coffee scene. People really are just this intense about coffee and truly see bad coffee as an offence, like socks and sandals, or crocs, or pickle ice cream, or pairing stripes with spots, or whatever other fashion and food atrocities there are people feel strongly about. Like putting ketchup on pasta in front of an Italian person, or putting pineapple on pizza. If he's anything like most coffee enthusiasts, he cares more about the relationship between you and coffee than anything between you guys.", "Wouldn't be surprised if he's one of those that thinks 'oh, OP just needs to go to pound town, and I'm the right man for the job to turn her straight'", "LOL not saying that's the case, but some men think that's just a bonus/he can turn you straight/you'll miss xyz. So I'd definitely put some space in between you and coffee guy, because making you a drink is a way too \"nice guy\" move.", "YES! I was just thinking that it would be a totally different story if he saw the Dunkin cup and said to OP: \"Hey, I saw you grabbed Dunkin. I have a moka pot in the break room, and was going to make some coffee, do you want a cup?\"  \n\n\nThat's a nice way to do a favor for someone and not make them feel bad. And also not be creepy or harassing while still showing off his coffee skills.", "Agreed. I have special interests I won't STFU about sometimes, but when someone loses their cool at me I'm always embarrassed and the one doing the apologizing later on. I might disclose the condition that makes me hyperfixate and miss social cues, but only as an explanation for why \\*I\\* made a faux pas\u2014not them.", "I live in Japan, and we just rated the major chains, but it was 7/11, Lawson, Daily, K, then Family Mart. Since then Family mart bought out K and changed their beans so I personally think their coffee is better than Lawson now, but 7 is still the best.", "Happy to answer especially as this example behaviour will become more common unfortunately for reasons I'll explain.\n\nBasically I was lucky I suppose that my diagnosis was much later as an adult, but my father was also diagnosed at the same time and already in his final years in the military, as was my younger brother who was still a young just coming into teenage years and then my youngest of my younger sisters (1/4 kids neurotypical ). So whilst we all got the benefit of \"that explains so much\" it never changed how my parents raised us beyond the typical stricter on the first child. We were still expected to be kind, considerate, generous etc even if we didn't understand why we had to be. Our world views were challenged again and again, the slowness in our understanding and remembering to be this way was accepted compassionately and obviously selfish, mean spirited behaviour was punished. \n\nWe were taught how to talk to people fairly , how to try and understand it from their point of view , to attest to how slow we are in this regard it's taken me 30 years to truly put myself into someone else's shoes and understand it. I understand the benefit of how I was raised and the disadvantages of how I see so many other children in my position being raised where the parents are bowing to instead of challenging the world view of their divergent children as it's easier and results in less meltdowns. You can still discipline autistic and ADHD children and hold them to the same standards as typical children (level of how autism affects them dependent of course) you just need more patience and to be gentle about it.\n\nThe golden rules I was taught when talking to people\n\n1. Is it true ?\n2. Is it necessary?\n3. Will it cause no harm?\n\nIf only one of those statements is a yes then don't say anything.\n\nAs more and more parents use autism/ADHD as a method of excusing their child's behaviour instead of taking the longer and harder path to help actually fit better into society they inadvertently teach the child that society should fit around them rather than fitting around each other.\n\nTo Parker he cannot understand why on earth would the OP enjoy terrible coffee , she must indeed have something wrong  in her head as that is the understanding his parents have inflicted by excusing his behaviour and bending  the world around him and by never forcing him to challenge his world view as far as he's aware this is the only world view.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 sorry", ">He started going off on my taste, how I wouldn\u2019t know good coffee if it hit me in the face, how I was crazy to drink that trash at various points throughout the day.\n\nCoworker was a rude ass.", "Quirky!~", ">As for \"idk how he hasn't learned that yet\", you must be aware that not every autistic person is able to develop or use the same set of skills?\n\nIf he's capable of going through school and getting a job, then he's capable of learning the skills needed to not harrass his coworkers. At 27 years old, it is his responsibility to access the tools and resources he needs to be able to succeed in life, and that includes making sure he knows the correct way to treat his coworkers. It would be irresponsible of him to enter the workforce if he isn't aware of how to follow the rules.", "Yo me too, and he is a HR violator.  Its called harassment", "Me too.", "Yep sometimes people just won't learn unless they have experiences like this one. Absolutely NTA", "Definitely this. \"Did you want some of the coffee I make.

Sounds like you had some really great, patient parents!", "No he wasn't..... it's like calling a sports fan weird for being passionate about football...OP is TA, they could've rolled their eyes and walked away any time.... but they unnecessarily insulted the coworker", "But your username.. think of all the chats you could have about coffee. \ud83d\ude02", "So your saying that it's ok for a coworker to constantly talk crap about how you drink your coffee?", "Slack here would be accepting his apology, except it doesn\u2019t seem like he gave an apology in the first place.
