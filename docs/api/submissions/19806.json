Btw, he did quit his job (not let go) and he doesn't contribute in any way? And why isn't he staying with his girlfriend, but has her come to your place?", "NTA.\n\nBut you kinda created this situation, you know?  I'm sure this person has shown questionable decision-making and \"cheap\" behaviors in the past, and yet you let into your home for some indeterminate period without charging him a dime.  You practically told him \"Yes, take advantage of us, buddy!\"  This was a mistake on your part and it is heartbreaking to watch.  I know friends are supposed to help each other, but you're doing too much, bro.\n\nYou need to push him out.  Give him 30 days to find a place under the threat of eviction (i.e., throwing his shit out).   As long as you're paying for everything, he has no incentive to get a job and be self-supporting.  Do it for your gf if you can't do it for yourself.", "NTA\n\nThis is what always seems to happen with good intentions.  Seems like a good dude, just help him get back on his feet and everyone feels good about themselves.\n\nAnd all involved dont set a timeline (written or verbal) .........  and this is where we always seem to end up.\n\nHave a sit down and set a timeline, ask questions and solicit questions from him.  Make sure this is crystal clear with no room for supposition. Then provide an eviction countdown as the days start getting closer.\n\nAs for the food, I think you need to completely shut him out on this as he has utterly abused you here.

But it sounds like you never set expectations with him? So now from his perspective he's offered to pay you to offset him being there as part of the deal and you keep saying no to that but building resentment about him not paying until you got mad.\n\nHe can't read your mind, so you can't expect him to understand \"I don't want you contributing financially since you're down on your luck\" and \"I expect you to contribute financially in this specific way\" without discussing it. Don't assume he is just going to catch onto your norms when you hint at stuff, just tell him it's part of the deal.", "YTA to yourself. Kick the user out.
