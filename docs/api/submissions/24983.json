She has no right to use his money. \n\nMy mom and Maddie are really mad since then because apparently they were counting on me to help her out because my grandparents are paying my college tuitions and I promised to always help her. Yesterday Maddie talked to her counselor, who told her that she should rethink what colleges she wants to apply to because she would have to take out large loans to pay for her dream school. Her counselor told her she should go to community college first to save money. \n\nMaddie started crying when she got home and said that her life is ruined and she has to go to community college.

A child that young doesn't have the mental capacity to make a promise of that nature.

What was unfair was that, based on that promise, that her parents didn\u2019t save enough money for her tuition.

Maddie needs to make a call on whether she\u2019s prepared to make sacrifices to get the education she wants.\n\nQuite frankly, your mum and stepfather are major AHs for assuming for years you would financially contribute.

I understand college is expensive.  Your sister is not alone in navigating college/funds/loans.  However, you are not responsible for her choices and should not be put in the position you are by the three of them.  You lost your father and recieved money from his death.  That is for you, not her or your mom and step dad.    \n\nQuestion:  what has your mother done with snything she recieved from your father's death?  What about survivors benefits that she may have recieved for you through out the years?", "NTA. Im sure your grandparents are stepping up with tuition precisely so that you can use your inheritance further up ahead, to pay for a masters, buy a house or whatever. In fact life it\u2019s not fair but you\u2019re making do with what you have, your stepsister should do it too.\nAnd if your mother mentions this again I\u2019d recommend spending some time with your grandparents as this would clearly show your mother doesn\u2019t have your best interest as her priority.", "NTA \n\n'No' is a complete answer. Life is not fair and expecting you to pay for her college without asking is nuts. Having a tantrum because of it is appalling.", "Hey, you made a promise to love and support your stepsister like a real sister and that comes with the obligation to pay for her college\u2026 wait [checks notes] it doesn\u2019t. Also you were 7 when they baited you into that promise. NTA. Hard", "Nta", "NTA. That was your dad\u2019s gift to you and you alone. It was meant to take care of you. She is not entitled to your money.", "NTA. Your mother is out of her mind if she genuinely believes you should give part of the money your dad left you when he DIED to fund your stepsister\u2019s education. It\u2019s great that your grandparents are paying for your college, but you still don\u2019t owe her the inheritance.", ">Maddie started crying when she got home and said that her life is ruined and she has to go to community college.\n\nAwww. That sucks for her. Her dream is ruined because she can't take tens of thousands of dollars out of her step-sister's inheritance from a deceased father. \nShe can go hug her dad. \n\n>My mom and Maddie are really mad since then because apparently they were counting on me to help her out because my grandparents are paying my college tuitions and I promised to always help her.\n\nPromises made at six are totally legally binding! Maddie doesn't even need the damn money, she just wants it. I hope you can stay with your grandparents. NTA. These situations are exactly why I tell people to set up trusts and leave things to their kids not their spouses because too often spouses use those resources on step children or new kids and screw over the original kid. \n\nYour mom likely got a monthly death benefit from the government. In the US they can be pretty decent as in probably covered most of your expenses. Your step sister likely benefitted from more overall money in the household there. Maddie isn't going to have a ruined life. This is a want, not a need. She needs to go blame her father for having her with someone that ended up in jail and for not marrying a rich woman.", "NTA\nI also lost my father young, at 10. My response would have been exactly the same. No amount of money could ever make up for the loss of a parent. No one is entitled to that inheritance except you. The fact that your mother does not get this is painful. I\u2019m sorry that they are not being more sensitive to your situation.", "So they want to hold you to something you were probably prompted to say at 6 years old, at six you still think you can fly if you put a fucking jacket on your head FFS.\nOp you don't owe anything to your Step sister her family have had her while life to save for her college, they just assumed you would hand over your father's money to your mum's new husbands child no, nope no way In Hell.that is terrible thing to do, and didn't you have to watch her have her father there her whole life , just cause your mum got married to her dad she played second to money not you, NTA not one bit, \n good luck in College cause if you give her money it won't stop they will just hit you up again for wedding or baby's put your foot down now.", "Nta. Remind her your dad had to DIE for you to have that money. I've lost enough family/friends and I'd rather them back than have the money.", "Absolutely not. AND, put that money into compounding safe funds, get a financial advisor and FORGET ABOUT IT. 99% of people don\u2019t have this, and they are fine making their way through life.\n\nIf you DONT TOUCH IT by the time you\u2019re 50-60, you\u2019ll probably be able to retire or at least be work optional.\n\nDONT TOUCH IT. FOR DECADES.\n\nNOT for your mom\nNOT for your step sister\nNOT FOR YOURSELF.\n\nLet it be gone from your mins", "OMGDS...NTA Opie you don't owe anyone anything. The ENTITLEMENT is nauseating!", "NTA\nDon\u2019t you dare let them bully/guilt you into paying a dime. Your dad was responsible enough to be planning ahead for you. He went the extra step to ensure even in death, you would be taken of. That money is for you. \nMaddie\u2019s parents are responsible for her, not you! Plus, if she was really that motivated, there are TONS of scholarships and grants available to those who need them. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re in the states. She needs to apply for FAFSA when it opens in December this year. Then ask her counselor about all the local scholarship opportunities any apply to all of them. If she keeps her GPA up, many colleges offer merit scholarships. There are so many other options for her. Like, so, so many! She just has to try even a little bit.\nIt\u2019s extremely toxic of your mother to even put that on you. Shame on her. I hope you\u2019ve talked to you grandparents about this too. They could probably help get legal involved. There may already be protections in place to prevent you from being taken advantage of like this. \nGood luck and I\u2019m so sorry you are having to struggle with this.", "Eliciting a promise form a child to always love and help a stepsibling is already ick\u2026 but if by \u201chelping\u201d what they meant was financially supporting then that was really gross and manipulative. You can \u201chelp\u201d Maddie in lots of ways without giving her a dime. The cost of your inheritance was your father\u2019s life. Unless she\u2019s paid the same cost, she\u2019s not entitled to any of your money and it was selfish, entitled and foolish of all of them to think that is what was going to happen.\n\nSave your money. Use it in a way that would make your dad proud. Make sure your mom doesn\u2019t have access to the money!! It sounds like she\u2019d try to steal it to show you how she thinks it should be spent. \n\nNTA", "If OP\u2019s dad hadn\u2019t died, she probably wouldn\u2019t have a stepsister that\u2019s \u201calways second to her\u201d and stepsister\u2019s parents would be in the same place. NTA but the parents and stepsister are.", "Perfect response", "What does \"deserve\" mean? Does OP \"deserve\" anything? You think inheritances are meritocracy in any sense of the word?\n\nThe difference between Maddy and OP, two 17 year old girls with comparable dreams and ambitions, is that one of them came from the proper sperm cell to be a nepo baby? And that's good and appropriate, according to this sub?\n\nYou can say it's how stuff legally works. Hoarding wealth is legal, giving a leg up to your blood relatives is legal, etc. There's no \"deserving\" or moral virtue in any of it. OP isn't better than Maddie or more deserving. She was just lucky to be put in a position where she's granted a privileged start of her adult life that will likely set her up for good, while Maddy needs to look at decades of debt. OP *can* do things to ameliorate that with no grand cost to herself comparably, especially with the financial security of her grandparents' wealth and her projected earning potential, and she chooses not to. \n\nYou can say it's unfair Maddy has her dad and OP doesn't, but Maddy's dad did in fact by the sounds of it step up and acted as a father figure for OP. If he was of the same mind as OP, he would have said not my kid not my problem. \n\nOP can legally do this, obviously, but if I were Maddy's dad I'd tell her she's dead to me and take away all her belongings that she accumulated over the years that were paid out of his salary. Her grandparents can afford to replace it. Oh, it'd make her feel bad or some of her stuff has sentimental value? Too bad, she's not his child.", "That would be an equivalence if OP's dad were dying right in front of Maddy and Maddy refused to help saying its none of her concern. I'm assuming that's not what happened. \n\nOP can help Maddy with no great cost to herself considering her financial situation with a good college lined up paid for and grandparents' assets. She's in a position to help without hurting herself much or like, practically at all. She just chooses not to.\n\n She's a spiteful privileged brat and I hope her stepfather and Maddy cut her out of their lives, then she can buy herself a new nuclear family.", "She\u2019s in jail", "I meant it\u2019s her fault she\u2019s always been second in academics, sports, and extracurriculars, which is what she was talking about when she said she\u2019s tired of always being second to me", "Her bio mom is in jail", "Yes, my dad legally left everything to my uncle so my mom couldn\u2019t access it.", "My parents were divorced by then so she didn\u2019t inherit anything and I don\u2019t know if she gets any survivors benefits or what she\u2019s does with them", "This blows my mind. If I was held accountable for all the shit I promised when I was 7, I would be living in a house shaped like a dog with 12 children while working as a police officer. \n\nKids promise stupid shit. That's why they can't be held accountable.  \n\nOP NTA, go live your life and let your stepsister learn that life isn't always fair. Sometimes you get stuck with parents that can't plan. That is the parent's fault.", "Not only is it possible but you should absolutely do it.\n\nIn the USA you would set up what is called a Living Trust in which you have complete control of the assets until you die.\n\nYou name a beneficiary just like you would a will and can change the beneficiaries at any time until you die just like a will.\n\nYou are typically the Trustee and appoint one or more Co-Trustees. Typically this is the spouse although to be extra careful one would also appoint a child as a co-trustee in the event that spouses die at the same time. Obviously you don\u2019t appoint a child until they are of an age when they are capable. When children are still young, you would appoint a trusted individual as a co trustee. This can be different than the person you select as the guardian of a minor child. \n\nThis example is for a typical situation in which assets are owned by both spouses equally. You can have Living Trusts set up so that they are separate in the event that assets are owned separately or beneficiaries are different.\n\nThe benefit to a Living Trust is that you avoid the expense and delays of probate. Also it is very helpful because when a child is a Co-Trustee they are able to seamlessly take over finances when their parent becomes incapacitated and the child can handle everything very easily when the parent dies.\n\nThe Trustee has no legal ability to use the assets of the trust except for the benefit of the owner of the trust. In my situation, I was a co trustee of my father\u2019s trust and when he got to a certain age, I began writing checks for him and dealing with his finances. I could not write a check for my benefit As that would be embezzling. When he died, it really made things easier as well as I just wrote checks for funeral expenses and last bills. Since I was the beneficiary I just provided copies of the trust to his various brokerage accounts and they were transferred to me without the need for a probate proceeding. \n\nThese trusts are not the same as the kind of generation skipping trusts that wealthy people set up to avoid taxes but are something that anyone - even just a home - should have in place.", "You wrote all of this out to fantasize about further emotionally traumatizing someone who is still, by definition, a child. You used all this pseudo-intellectualism to give merit to what you said and make it sound as matter-of-fact and not emotionally charged. The thing is, we can tell you are seething with rage that someone\u2019s parent died and left them money that she did not earn, but her dad surely did, through paying for life insurance or work. Literally seek help. And she does not have a privileged start. Her dad died, that is the only reason she was left any inheritance so that even if she ended up alone in the world once he was gone, her dad could at least ease the financial burden of him not being there.", "And natural talent had no influence at all.  It\u2019s not like those sorts of things come easier to some people than others.  It\u2019s just because you\u2019re so much better.", "Haaaa. There we go. Your mom probably got ~$900/month in SSI benefits a month that paid for you."]}
