She has no right to use his money. \n\nMy mom and Maddie are really mad since then because apparently they were counting on me to help her out because my grandparents are paying my college tuitions and I promised to always help her. Yesterday Maddie talked to her counselor, who told her that she should rethink what colleges she wants to apply to because she would have to take out large loans to pay for her dream school.

A child that young doesn't have the mental capacity to make a promise of that nature.

Maddie needs to make a call on whether she\u2019s prepared to make sacrifices to get the education she wants.\n\nQuite frankly, your mum and stepfather are major AHs for assuming for years you would financially contribute.

You don't owe them anything,plain and simple. Focus on your future and ignore them. Life is in fact not fair,your dad died and hers is right there. Your mother and stepfather's lack of planning is not your business", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour father left that money to you. If he had wanted it to go to any future stepchildren your mother had, he would have said so. Maddie's dreams would not be \"ruined\" if she hadn't counted on using your money to fund them. There is nothing wrong with community college.", "You are NTA for not sharing your money and heck, no please don't. Your mom is TA for expecting you to do so, you lost your dad!  Why hasn't stepdad done a thing for his own kid?  My (60F) hubby and I started saving when our first kid was about 2 months old, and we saved for both kids enough to pay for most of their college.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with community college for 2 years and then finishing up at her fancy school IF her grades are high enough.  Both of our kids became RAs their senior year to save the housing cost on campus and both had jobs during the summer.  What has Maddie saved up for her schooling?\n\nEdit to add: I forgot she had a mom, if her bio mom hasn't died, why didn't she save for Maddie's college?", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely don't give any of your money to Maddie, your Mom or your Stepdad.  That's your money, not theirs.  \n\nYour Mom and Stepdad have known their financial situation for years and had 11 years in which to save and invest for Maddie's college expenses.  And yet, they encouraged Maddie to believe she could attend whatever school she wanted.  That was extremely irresponsible parenting on their part.  But it isn't your responsibility to just give them your money because your parents encouraged Maddie to have dreams they knew they couldn't afford. \n\nIf Mom and Stepdad want Maddie to attend a certain school, Mom and Stepdad can figure out how to help her pay for, or finance, it.\n\nThe counselor did Maddie a favor in telling her to be more realistic during college application season.  It's possible, too, that advice was partly based on Maddie's school performance or other application considerations.  Even state flagship universities can be very competitive to get admitted into. \n\nIn addition to local community college, Maddie could look into any colleges within commuting distance (room and meal plan are expenice and staying at home can save about half the cost of attendance).\n\nYou should consider talking to your grandparents and letting them know what's going on.  They may be willing to have a conversation with your Mom about her behavior.  Or they might be able to offer you a place to stay if things become uncomfortable at home.\n\nLastly, please don't equate love with money.  You like ve your Mom, but that doesn't mean you should give her money.  And you shouldn't feel like you need to pay for things for saying partners.  Love people enough to let them be independent and responsible for themselves.  You don't need to buy their love.", "NTA. OP, is the money in an account that your mom and stepdad can't access?", "NTA.\n\nYour stepsister is dumb. If her funds are limited, community college is a great choice. I am currently enrolled in community college, following the transfer guide published by my university of choice to the letter, and I estimate that this strategy is saving me approximately $52,000.\n\nI also realized that, while following the transfer guide, I could complete an associate's degree in another subject with only a few additional courses. So, I will major in government at my university of choice but I am also completing a Spanish AA at my community college.\n\nWhen she is done pouting / sullying your father's memory for her own selfish desire, I recommend suggesting this course of action to her.", "NTA.  She can take out loans like everyone else, or adjust her schooling expectations like everyone else. There are loans, grants, scholarships and JOBS if she really wants to make it happen. Not your fault that the parents didn't save money or couldn't, but they have no right to ask, expect, or touch the money that YOUR father left you.  Having dealt with something similar myself, I just don't talk about it and keep a low profile. Hopefully they have no ability to touch those funds.  If they pressure you too much I'd honestly find somewhere else to stay that is safe. They'll just turn up the heat once the time nears to start school probably. Glad you have a good head on your shoulders. Their entitlement amidst your trauma and loss disgusts me.  Being a young female in today's economy I'd hang on to every penny.", "NTA. Your mom and stepdad are trying to hold you to a vague promise made by a 6year old you. Your dad left you that money and your grandparents are trying to help you out also.

The entitlement is incredible.", "NTA - she has both her parents.", "\"It's not fair that you get money and I don't!!\"\n\nYou're right; it's **absolutely** unfair that *my father died* and that's the *only* reason you're even a part of my family in the first place.

The daughter has a number of half siblings/stepsiblings, who have to take out loans, went to public school (while she went to private), etc. She has a better car than even her mom. It sucks for them, but it is unfair for them to demand she share the money we give with them. It is unfair for your mom to do that for you.", "Has your stepsister considered applying for scholarships?\n\nif she has good grades and extracurriculars, I suggest she apply for ROTC scholarship by going to a recruiting center and talking to an officer recruiter.

That should be enough to shut everyone down.\n\n> when I was six or seven, I promised that I would love my stepsister like my real sister and help her however I could.\n\nThat is some manipulative BS you mother and step father pulled. They had this planned all along.", "NTA- You dont owe her anything her father should have saved more for her to go. That was left to you by your dad. Tell your mom to take her head out her ass, you dont owe your stepsister anything.", "NTA. First, a promise by a six year old is not legally or morally binding. Expecting that a child saying this requires them to finance a college education is ludicrous. You can help your step-sister by showing her how to apply for scholarships, do a work study, etc. That is help too. In the end you get to decide how you can help, if at all.  I'm sorry your step-sister can't go to her \"dream school\". That happens to a lot of people. We have to live within our means.", "Not only that bit the reason her mother says she should pay being that OP made a \"promise\" to always help her sister our when she was SRVEN YEARS OLD! It's insane for the mother to hold that against op now! A 7 year old doesn't understand how much money college costs, it's crazy to think her mother would assume that's what she meant.", ">They extracted this promise from you when you were 6 and are now trying to use it against you because they failed to save for Maddie's college expenses.\n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder if they were as diligent as they could have been in saving for Maddie\u2019s college, or if they prioritized other things because they expected to be able to badger the OP into chipping in a nice chunk of change.", "It\u2019s refreshing to see this. Too many people don\u2019t take the proper precautions, and their kids lose the inheritance they intended for them to a stepparent or stepsiblings or half-siblings. \n\nJust make sure that, whoever the trustee is, they know that the money is for your child and your child only. For some people, I can see how they would justify any spending \u201cfor the family\u201d as being for the benefit of the child, for example paying for a vacation for the whole family from the child\u2019s trust fund, rather than just the child\u2019s share of the cost, or using the child\u2019s trust fund to buy a car for the parent or stepparent because it will sometimes be used to drive the child places.", "Absolutely not.

If her parents have no money, she fills out the FAFSA by October or so, and then she'll get scholarships based on her need.  If she had good grades, her dream school will give her scholarships.  She can apply to all the local scholarships, if any (like Lions club type of things).
