Isn't it more important that the people you love are with you, safe, and having fun?\n\nHad someone worn crocs to mine, I doubt I would even have noticed.", "Not in this area no, it's basically like a village with some shops and restaurant but they're mainly like outdoorsy shops.

I would have only had an hour to look for something, everything shuts really early and thats assuming I can find something in Ambleside. I didn't have the time to go to the next big town over and look. Also like everyone was busy seeing family so no-one could drive and look with me and I didn't feel comfortable with driving on my ankle. I would have looked if I had more time but that hour would have been a push alone", "INFO: is it often that u do something like this?

You could have bought a pair of flats to wear.", "Obviously NTA. Imagine if you'd fallen and broken your ankle a week before and had to turn up in a massive brace!\n\n Injuries happen, and tbf there are a lot worse places to go than Loughrigg Fell if you're looking to get your ankle snapped around there. You didn't go anywhere you're very likely to get hurt, you had an accident and couldn't wear heels most of the wedding day; c'est la vie. \n\nI'd be appreciative, were it my wedding, that you were even making the effort with the photos.

You are totally NTA here.", "NTA - it\u2019s not terribly uncommon to change into more comfortable shoes for a reception when there\u2019s going to be dancing.  Heck, my sister wore sneakers to her own wedding reception.", "I'm sorry (not sorry)  but crocs are an abomination in itself. Let alone in a wedding. Sneakers would have been better any day of the week", "Or could've gone to a shoe store and bought some flats. Did you ruin the wedding, no. Did you stand out, yes", "Why my sister and I don't get on is because of her husband, not really because I've done something like this to her. \n\nYeah when we have family get togethers, I tend to dress less formally than other members. Like one time we all went to a dinner when one of my uncles was flying into the country. I dressed in the dress code but they all went up and beyond because they think its better to be overdressed and some of my aunts hate that I don't go along with them in that regard", "If she hurt her ankle her foot could also be swollen. It could hurt her too much to try to get her foot into a regular shoe or sneakers. She did put on heels for the photos. I think it was reasonable to wear the crocs if that caused her less pain. I think her sister was a little harsh with her. Accidents happen.", "The Lake District is quite remote and has no large shopping areas.", "If her foot was swollen due to the injury to her ankle it could have been difficult to even get flats on. I am speaking from experience here. I once sprained my ankle so badly part of my foot swelled badly. It was even difficult to wear flat sandals   because my foot was swollen even though the sandals were quite open. I ended up in fuzzy slippers because that\u2019s all I could get on my foot.  People are being a little harsh here.  She managed to wear heels for the wedding pictures then changed them out.", "One of my friends did a floor-length gown and wore sneakers!", "The Lake District is not somewhere where it's easy to just go buy new shoes, unless you want wellies or walking boots.", "Depends where OP was staying and what time they had the fall. May have been no shoe shops or the shops may have been closed by that time. Many Lake District towns are very small.", "ah okay! makes sense then", "Awesome! One of my sisters did the same thing years ago-she doesn't have any mobility issues, she's a runner and didn't want to spend good money on shoes she wouldn't be able to run in. I liked her reasoning!

Then the bride would complain about that.", "How dare OP and her parents use their downtime for something they enjoy in a beautiful location?! Everyone knows they should have sat immobile thinking wedding thoughts about the wedding king and queen the entire wedding weekend!", "People are allowed to do other things. Not everything about a wedding weekend revolves around a wedding. I\u2019m so tired of the \u201cme, me, my special day\u201d attitude.", "Ballerina flats with no ankle support or heel support? Yes, those will be excellent for an ankle injury. SMH.", "no, the sister is for worrying more about looks outside of pictures than her own sisters comfort. normally yes but op got injured", "Ballerina flats for an ankle injury? It was bad enough she apparently should have gone to the hospital, but you\u2019re telling her to suck it up and aggravate it further in dirt cheap ballerina flats from some corner shop that will offer absolutely no support?", "And? She had crocs that cost her nothing that day. She didn\u2019t have to travel anywhere to get them. Makes sense to me to not bring them along.", "I would say a minor asshole at most.", "Crocs are awesome for people who have problem feet. Do they look good? Oh hell no. But having gone decades wearing the \"pretty shoes\" and doing less because every step hurt like a mf, I'll take the Crocs if it means I can do things.", "I used to think the same until I tried them (whilst working in a clinic setting during the pandemic, they are super easy to clean and ticked all the hygiene boxes). Now I own two pairs and have converted several people to them too. And you know what is adorable? Children\u2019s crocs \u2764\ufe0f", "For the wedding I told people they can wear whatever they feel fabulous and comfortable in but politely requested no Crocs. As soon as I saw this post I was like ahh YTA. Just because they are sooo gross. I think with an injury I agree with not wearing heels but trainers would have been better.", "such a weird personal opinion. they\u2019re shoes you do not have to wear, who cares? are you spending that much time looking at people\u2019s feet? lmfao", "Have you been to the Lake District?  Because I live there and you don\u2019t just pop out and buy some shoes, depending on where you are, because everything is 50 miles and five hundred back roads away", "Whilst there's at least one small town near Loughrigg, you're only getting there by car, you'd find it easier buying walking shoes than flat shoes suitable for a wedding and shopping hours are also typically short so you'd have to be luckily with time. If you can only wear crocs, than you can only wear crocs.\n\nNTA", "Oh no, god forbid anybody ever stand out.", "I don't know about the weddings you attend, but in my culture people have turned very bold in the past few years. The number of ppl wearing trainers is appalling... i don't get why you'd wear a formal ballgown just to pair it up with your workout shoes unless you have an injury. Still a small improvement after the \"barefoot\" era when ppl got drunk and ditched the shoes altogether by the end of the night... op would have fit right in", "Entirely unreasonable.", "I have wide feet... they don't really sell that many flats in EE.  Just throwing this out there.", "Now there is a practical bride. \ud83d\ude02", "Sounds like she was determined to be annoyed about something!", "I also this the sister was harsh, which is why I voted ESH. I definitely wouldn\u2019t suggest anything that would further damage her ankle but some sandals would\u2019ve been more wedding appropriate.", "All these \u201cjust go buy flats people!\u201d are really showing they have no idea what the Lakes District is like AND no idea how terrible an idea flats are for an ankle injury.\n\nAt least if they said, \u201cshould have just gone and bought hiking boots!\u201d they\u2019d be closer to an actual idea\u2026", "Not all that different than crocks in that respect though", "And Crocs that she still changed up for heels at picture time.\n\nWould OPs sister have preferred a cast and crutches?", "Ohhh, apparently ballerina shoes are the only ones that exist?", "I think I'm broken because they are not comfortable to me at all. I broke my ankle a few months back and when I went back to work aftwr the cast came off, none of my shoes fit on the swollen foot. I caved and bought Crocs because everyone swore they were so comfortable! I wore them for one day and hated them for every second. Couldn't wear them barefoot because they were so hard on the soles of my feet and even with socks (which an abomination anyway), they weren't at all comfortable", "Perhaps OP could not get their foot into trainers because of swelling. OP had appropriate footwear for pictures. It\u2019s not a fashion show. Wedding culture is toxic.", "From my reading online, some places in europe tend to not be open all the time like in the US", "And just to provide some context for the Americans as a 50 mile drive is nothing to them.\n\nIn the UK doing a 50 mile drive is something you rarely do. Most people will find anything more than a 30 mile commute to work excessive. \n\nThe distance between our 2 biggest cities, London and Birmingham is 120 or 2.5hours and for us this is like driving from Boston to Washington.", "I live just outside the Lake District.  The roads are rammed with slow moving traffic because of the large amount of tourist\u2026 and then someone decides to dig up a road and installs temporary traffic lights and you\u2019re going nowhere.", "High heels are ridiculously painful and awful for your feet. I\u2019m not saying everyone should break dress code, but if it\u2019s the end of the night or after the ceremony and pictures and the bride and guests want to just wear trainers or hell even crocs with their fancy cloths I see no problem with it.", "Maybe you have a pair of sandles stored up your arse for emergencies but OP apparently did not. What tf is she supposed to do in the arse end of nowhere (the Lake District) when she is away for the week with a pre-packed bag? The Lake District is like Yellowstone for the UK, except there\u2019s a crap tonne of fudge shops instead of bears.", "yes, so true!! then the sister would be mad bc theyre not aesthetic \ud83d\ude44", "You\u2019re the one who suggested cheap ballerina flats that one could just pop out and buy.\n\nBut by all mean, suggest some alternatives that are both wedding appropriate, supportive of an ankle injury, and easily available to grab quick in the lakes district. \n\nBecause if she\u2019d handled it properly, the doctor would have likely had her in a walking cast. OP should have done that so her sister could forever remember her injury in photos and taken up even more attention with everyone asking her what happened to her.", "And a 50 mile drive in the Lake District could take a couple of hours\u2026 you\u2019re on single - lane back roads not a several lane motorway", "And sheep. Don't forget the sheep.", "There\u2019s a lot more in the Lake District than Yellowstone. OP said she was in Ambleside which has a lot more shops than anywhere in Yellowstone. National parks in England are significantly less remote than in the USA", "Girl, ignore these people. You\u2019re allowed to walk. You\u2019re allowed to wear shoes. You\u2019re allowed to fucking exist outside of a wedding! People hurt themselves all the time just walking about their homes. What - were you not supposed to use stairs or sharp knives in the run up to *someone else\u2019s wedding* just in case you suffered an injury and your bandages distracted from the bride? No. Your sister needs to get over herself and so does everyone saying you\u2019re an A. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChrist alive, it\u2019s not like you wore unsanctioned footwear down the aisle?! Even in pictures you could have just stood behind someone. You generously changed into heel for the pics but did not have to. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForget these people. Heal your ankle. Live your life.", "don't pretend crocs support ankle injury Ms Doctor xDDDD", "Uh-huh.  I bet you have lots of friends.  And you seem super sympathetic towards the disabled, also a plus."]}
