Isn't it more important that the people you love are with you, safe, and having fun?\n\nHad someone worn crocs to mine, I doubt I would even have noticed.", "Not in this area no, it's basically like a village with some shops and restaurant but they're mainly like outdoorsy shops.

I would have only had an hour to look for something, everything shuts really early and thats assuming I can find something in Ambleside.

Also like everyone was busy seeing family so no-one could drive and look with me and I didn't feel comfortable with driving on my ankle.

You could have bought a pair of flats to wear.", "Obviously NTA. Imagine if you'd fallen and broken your ankle a week before and had to turn up in a massive brace!\n\n Injuries happen, and tbf there are a lot worse places to go than Loughrigg Fell if you're looking to get your ankle snapped around there. You didn't go anywhere you're very likely to get hurt, you had an accident and couldn't wear heels most of the wedding day; c'est la vie. \n\nI'd be appreciative, were it my wedding, that you were even making the effort with the photos.

Sneakers would have been better any day of the week", "[deleted]", "Why my sister and I don't get on is because of her husband, not really because I've done something like this to her. \n\nYeah when we have family get togethers, I tend to dress less formally than other members.

I dressed in the dress code but they all went up and beyond because they think its better to be overdressed and some of my aunts hate that I don't go along with them in that regard", "If she hurt her ankle her foot could also be swollen.

Accidents happen.", "The Lake District is quite remote and has no large shopping areas.", "If her foot was swollen due to the injury to her ankle it could have been difficult to even get flats on. I am speaking from experience here. I once sprained my ankle so badly part of my foot swelled badly. It was even difficult to wear flat sandals   because my foot was swollen even though the sandals were quite open. I ended up in fuzzy slippers because that\u2019s all I could get on my foot.

One of my sisters did the same thing years ago-she doesn't have any mobility issues, she's a runner and didn't want to spend good money on shoes she wouldn't be able to run in. I liked her reasoning!

Yuck.", "NTA - you changed shoes when it mattered. It's not like you were planning on spraining your ankle, so you didn't bring any backup wedding shoes (like some flats or something) - she's overreacting.", "NTA. \nNow have a fun family vacation with your new very endearing SIL", "Yup as soon as I heard they were backup shoes she didn\u2019t wear in photos I said NTA. My grandmother IL wore sneakers to our wedding because she had foot surgery. My MIL did her mother/son dance in flip flops bc she had already taken off her wedding shoes. I did not give one singular flying fuck because I was too excited *celebrating my wedding.* \n\nHad a boot due to a broken ankle at my friend\u2019s wedding. Ended up having to buy a last minute romper outfit at target because my planned dress would\u2019ve been a disaster. It wasn\u2019t really up to dress code. Asked my friend permission (but really more of a heads up) and she didn\u2019t care at all either. This is perfectly acceptable wedding etiquette.", "That's amazing, lol.", "It's not dangerous to us. I've run longer distances than that, done fell running before, ran in all kinds of weather. If I felt I was in any danger, I would have pushed for a different activity but this was an accident, a fluke\n\nI wasn't that keen on it but that's what my parents wanted to do it and I wanted to spend some time with them before the wedding and since I don't see them that often", "It's not a dangerous activity to me or my parents. Just a fluke on my part", "What's H&S? Also, Crocs are in right now", "It isn't risky to my family, it was an accident. We trail run, fell run similar distances, all sorts of weather.\n\nI figured if I didn't go, my sister would kick up a fuss about it. It would have been the talk of the wedding.", "Why did the aunts \u201cknow\u201d you wouldn\u2019t follow dress code? Have you done this before?", "This kinda falls under the category of celebrities not doing things that could get them hurt while filming a project", "I think you're not necessarily the AH, because a reasonable person wouldn't object to an injured guest slipping into crocs when to ease their pain, especially as you were in heels for the photos.\n\nHowever ... I know the Lake District. I assume, if you were injured running on Loughrigg that you were staying near Ambleside. Ambleside definitely has non-outdoors clothing shops. Google is giving me this one:\n\nhttps://www.rushambleside.co.uk/#womenswear\n\nMight have been worth a quick phone call if you were anticipating that your sister might have a funny reaction to the crocs.", "Health and Safety. Hospital staff are prohibited by some hospitals to wear Crocs as Crocs have holes in them, so if a needle/scalpel falls, they could get injured or infected. \nI\u2019m not sure in what universe Crocs are \u201cin\u201d, but if they are, they should be banned. Surely you could have found nicer flats to wear (ballerina flats, Converse-like trainers, flip-flops, Toms, anything else, really!)", "May I ask why? I think they're really comfy", "Yeah we were staying in Ambleside. I guess I must have missed it when I was going through my head thinking about the shops in the town", "I have a pair that I love because they have a plush inside like slippers. They're as cozy as soft slippers, but with a back to hold them in place. And unlike the normal crocs, they don't rub against my bare skin with that rubber stuff.", "I have foot problems to the point I have had extensive surgery done on my right ankle because I damaged it so bad.\n\nI freaking loathe crocs. They are not comfortable and actually have caused issues when I tried to wear them. My Mom loved them and I was all great for you. I loathe them with the passion of a thousand suns.\n\nSo, you are not alone.", "You\u2019re not broken, they\u2019re not for everyone. I like mine for gardening, slippers, and water shoes.", "BUT YOU NEVER ASK HER.  You thought it was okay AND YOU WERE WRONG.", "I guess I would have been wrong either way in your eyes then", "That's what I want for my wedding album, nice classic photos and then just random photos of things that look interesting or if something cool is happening. Your photographer sounds great", "Lots of shops in the Lake District sell sandals which might not be perfect wedding attire but are a lot better than crocs", "I think if you asked her, and she told you to come or not, you would not be an AH in anyway.  But I guess since you never thought that that was possible ... it is like you never even consider about other people or something.", ">suitable replacement shoes available for a wedding? No\n\nIf it's not the heels, all women were in heels, it's not suitable for a wedding. Sandals wouldn't have been good enough", "Yeah! https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14hwttm/aita_for_saying_no_to_my_wife_to_be_a_bridesmaid/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1", "Sandals wouldn\u2019t have been better than crocs?", "Omg I did read that one!
