It's so beautiful here, they had a lovely outdoor wedding, it was very intimate and only included family and friends because they wanted to go all out and make a mini-holiday of it. We all arrived Wednesday morning and are due to leave on Sunday so people can go to work.\n\nIf you know the Lake District, there are lots of beautiful walks and scenic views. My family are quite seasoned runners and hikers so my parents and I did a 12K trail run/hike of Loughrigg on Thursday. It wasn't my idea, more so my parents, but I run longer distances on the road so thought how hard could it be? I also don't see my parents often and thought it would be nice to do something with them while they aren't pre-occupied with work. It was rocky in some parts and you have to be careful on your feet. I was not careful enough and had a bad fall and hurt my ankle. \n\nThe only shoes I brought with me were my road trainers, trail trainers (I hike in these anyway), my wedding heels (3 inch) and Crocs since I wear them to travel in. Because I was feeling some pain on the day of the wedding (Friday), I brought them with me incase I needed them and I did end up needing them so I wore them during the wedding. For official photos, I wore the heels but then would change into my crocs when nothing too important was going on.\n\nMy sister saw me in my crocs while I was at down and asked me why I wasn't in my heels. I explained that I had a bad fall when I was running and this was more comfortable and I didn't want to aggravate my ankle. She wasn't very happy and said I shouldn't have gone if it was too risky for me. I asked her what the point of having the wedding in the Lakes was if she didn't want any of us to take advantage of the trails. She said that wasn't the point and it was rude to show up in Crocs. I said that I really should have gone to the hospital but I didn't want to detract from her wedding so she should be grateful I'm here even in my Crocs. My sister and I aren't particularly close.\n\nMy sister has been messaging families about my Crocs and now I'm getting grief for wearing them at a formal event and my aunts have been making snide remarks about how they knew I wasn't going to follow the dress code.

They were backup shoes and you had an injury. You wore the heels for pics. Wedding culture has become so toxic. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA - \"Your options were having me there in crocs or not there at all.  Which one did you prefer?\"", "NTA- oh, ffs, your sis needs to get over herself. You wore the appropriate footwear for the photos and put yourself in pain to do so. She should be grateful you were willing to do that much, not snipe at you for not doing more. Crocs in the wedding photos could have been a funny family story to share in the years to come if she didn't have such a stick up her arse.", "Listen, if you show up to a nice wedding and a T-shirt and shorts then you're going to be an ass. \n\nBut you had a good reason because you were injured. What was the bride going to do if someone broke their ankle kicked them out? NTA", "NTA - you made the effort to change when it mattered for the photos.   \n\nIf you'd fractured your ankle Im sure there would be no grief for a plaster and crutches.   Or if you went to hospital maybe you'd have crutches and a compression bandage and crocs anyways.", "NTA. Your sister tho\u2026wowza. Ungrateful!!!", "NTA at all. You still wore the heels for what counts, the photos which will be displayed and what the wedding will be remembered by. She should be happy you cared enough to do that. Besides, it's just plain cruel to expect somebody to wear heels all of the time with an injured ankle of all things.", "NTA. You had an injured foot. Heels are the last thing anyone should wear with a foot injury for crying out loud. Your sister was being insensitive. And what is up with the family gossiping behind your back? You wouldn\u2019t happen to be the family scapegoat would you?", "Soft YTA- out of all of the shoes you brought, why the crocs? If you can\u2019t walk in the heels, that\u2019s ok (at least tell your sister beforehand,) but what about the running shoes? \n(I also don\u2019t think that trail running the day before a wedding on unknown trails is a very good idea)", "ESH. I get that hurting your ankle was out of your control but crocs really aren\u2019t wedding appropriate and your sister is allowed to be a bit upset given that you didn\u2019t seem to try too hard to find a solution.", "is there a reason you didn't wear one of your other shoes, rather than the crocs? unless i'm mistaken the crocs are the most unsightly of all the shoes you had. wouldn't one of the others have worked better?\n\ni suppose it's possible it's easier to switch between crocs and heels than other shoes and heels?", "NAH\u2026 I get why you wore them but I can also see someone being a bit annoyed since Crocs look pretty obnoxious. If you guys already have a contentious history, that would definitely inflame the situation", "NAH but come on. There are no stores where this wedding is taking place? You could have bought a pair of flats. You might have even been able to order flats from somewhere and had them overnighted.\n\nCrocs are repulsive (even for traveling) and wearing them to a wedding is ridiculous. She probably would have been less offended if you just took off your shoes altogether,  plenty of women end up barefoot as weddings go on.", "NTA. Your sister is though.  You wore the heels for the photos, rest of the time you were comfortable,  really you should of gone and got it xrayed.  I hope you will just to be sure there's no fracture.....and take a photo of the xray, send it to your sister with \"Great news!  It's not broken \"", "NTA, no one is going to remember  in 5 years what people wore on their feet at a wedding especially when you wore the heels for all the important bits and formal photos. Your sister is freshly married and should be busy sexing not texting", "NTA You did the best you could with the footwear you had available and even wore the heels for the photos despite your injury. She\u2019s being awfully petty to fixate on your shoes, which no one will remember in a few years, on what should be one of the happiest days of her life. \n\nJust tell that you\u2019re sorry about having to wear the crocs due to your injury and then talk about how great SHE looked and how lovely her wedding was. Hopefully she\u2019ll get over it soon and focus on more joyful topics! Hope you\u2019re feeling better.", "NTA I was totally ready to call you TA but you had a legitimate reason. If you had gone to the doctor beforehand you would have shown up in a boot or a cast, which would have been more unsightly. \n\nYou wore your heels in the pictures that will be a permanent record of the event. Your sister has nothing to be upset about as you made the best of a difficult situation. She should be more concerned that you injured your yourself.", "YTA\n\nNot for going on the trail, not for falling, and not for wanting to not aggravate your ankle. YTA because you decided you didn't need to try and salvage a wedding aesthetic. This is a one-time event. You could have sent your parents into town to grab you a cheap pair of flats. Stop acting like the option was just Crocs or heels.\n\nSwallow your pride and apologize. You messed up.", "YTA. \n\nYou knew the running shoes you brought were not safe for the rocky trail terrain, but you went on the hike anyway and paid the price by hurting your ankle. \n\nYour sister's wedding was not in the Lakes so that you personally could go on a hike. It was there because she and her husband wanted it to be. \n\nYou were careless, got injured due to carelessness, then wore the most hideous shoes known to man to your own sister's wedding. \n\nYou put your own good time ahead of your sister's wedding. You are the asshole here.", "NTA. God, she cares more about aesthetics at her wedding than her sister's own comfort and safety after a fall/risk of aggravating it further. Didn't you know you were supposed to sit in a bubble unmoving until her perfect day? She's the massive A as are your aunts", "Since you brought heels as a quick change, I'm going with NTA\n\nI was fully prepared to go the other way, but you did your best", "YTA\n\n1) Engaging in somewhat risky behavior like trail running on an unfamiliar trail probably wasn't the best idea right before the big event--which you demonstrated by twisting your ankle. Your family could have just as easily enjoyed the scenery with a nice sedate walk in a flat area. So bad decision #1 right there.\n\n2) Were there really no stores in the area? **Could you not have purchased a simple, comfortable and appropriate pair of ballet flats that you could have worn to the wedding? Or a tasteful sandal?** Literally any shoe out there would have been nicer than a pair of Crocs. So I am finding it hard to believe that you tried your hardest to solve this dilemma and feel that your stated animosity towards your sister likely played a part.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yeah, no one will be looking at the photos in a few years....and certainly not looking at footwear.", "NTA. You did well to get through the photos in heels.", "NTA. Your sister is making a mountain from a mole hill.", "A few years ago, my husband and I attended a very elegant outdoors black tie wedding. Even though all guests were warned that tuxedos and full length gowns were compulsory, we were also warned to bring shoes suitable for walking in grass on possibly uneven ground. I had to go out and buy dressy looking silver flats but was amused to see that after the wedding ceremony, the entire wedding party and their families all changed into Crocs!

Problem solved.", "Even if you hadn't changed into the heels for photos and just kept the crocs on, WHO CARES?!!

Idk why people get so fixated on appearances, especially on a day that is meant to celebrate connection.\n\nNTA.", "And at least she had the decency to choose a nice Croc color?? Hope you had some Jibbitz on hand  just for the FU lol", "I don't know, I wouldn't put it past her though", "I am definitely the black sheep of the family. When I was younger, everyone sort of expected me to go in a certain direction with my life but I moved away and decided to do something different", "My crocs are white and my running shoes are bright pink with purple stripes. I felt my Crocs would stand out less since my dress was a pastel blue.\n\nIt was less so my idea but my parents and I wanted some one-on-one time with them", "Well like my Crocs are white, my road shoes are bright pink, my trail shoes are green and reflective. I figured my Crocs are the least attention drawing and also go well with my dress anyway", "Yeah we were kind of arguing before she got engaged because I don't like her husband very much", ">I get why you wore them but I can also see someone being a bit annoyed since Crocs look pretty obnoxious.\n\nBut why is perfect appearance so damn important?  Isn't it more important that the people you love are with you, safe, and having fun?\n\nHad someone worn crocs to mine, I doubt I would even have noticed.", "Not in this area no, it's basically like a village with some shops and restaurant but they're mainly like outdoorsy shops. Definitely catered to hiking. No-one could drive me and I didn't feel comfortable doing so myself with my ankle.\n\nMy crocs are so comfy, I wear them every time I travel", "Lake District is a national park with small towns/ villages", "Fingers crossed, I've really tried to minimise moving around since the fall. My Dad is taking me to get it checked out on Monday", "Thankyou! I am feeling a bit better, got some painkillers. My parents have been a massive help", "Not sure if you're familiar with the Lake District but there are no Primarks or H&M's or anything like that. The majority of the shops are hiking ones and like gift shops. While I could have asked someone to go with me to look, it would have taken a drive and no-one had the time to go with me and I didn't feel comfortable driving with my ankle", ">shoes I brought with me were my road trainers, trail trainers (I hike in these anyway)\n\nNope definitely safe, used my trail ones", "Yeah, I figured it made sense so the proper photos looked good", "1. They could have but this is what my parents wanted to do and since I don't see them often, I obliged\n2. No. All the main shops are hiking and outdoors ones. Its not like a city centre and very unlikely I would have found anything suited towards a wedding. I also couldn't really drive myself in or had the time to look", "Yeah, the neon crocs are a headache lol and don't really match with anything so I got white ones", "Also easier to take on and off for photos", "It\u2019s hard ESH her for not understanding you for going hiking even with chance. She probably thought you were faking.", "ok gotcha!", "Oof. OP, honestly, did you wear the crocs as a sort of protest then? I think it could definitely look like that from the outside", "I don't think she noticed when I was stood up, I was sat down with my leg crossed over the other one and she saw", "I'm not going to sit here and argue with you. You asked for an opinion and you got one. Like, read what you just typed. It's another excuse. \n\nYou didn't come here for an opinion. You came for validation. I'm not gonna give it to you. Sounds like your sister is tired of you excusing your way out of apologies. Hope losing your sister is worth right-fighting over some shoes.", "Maybe? But she asked our parents and they also explained", "No, they were just the least offensive shoe option I had with me. If I really wanted to protest, I could have gone to the hospital or not showed up at all", "An excuse, or a reason? OP said there weren't any stores nearby that sold appropriate shoes for a wedding. So what is she supposed to do?", "I'm not arguing, just clarifying there are no clothing shops here or anywhere suitable for a wedding attire", "You seem nice \ud83d\ude44", "Alright, fair enough. appreciate the honesty with that!", "I really can't imagine getting upset over crocs, especially with the setting she chose.  I can't tell you what any of my guests wore. or even what shoes I wore.  I was too busy caring about having my favorite people with me and having a good time.", "I mean, it's just not true. There's a Pavers nearby that she could have gotten wedges or flats at.", "Outdoor stores often have hiking sandals which would\u2019ve probably been more wedding appropriate than crocs.", "Yep, me disagreeing and explaining why she's wrong makes me a bully. Wah.", "Right! The scenery was so gorgeous, she should have been enjoying that lol", "No Pavers in Ambleside, would have had to drive", "Potentially, though I felt the reaction from my sister would have been the same if i'd showed up in any kind of casual footwear. All of the women were in heels apart from the kid", "It\u2019s completely unreasonable to expect people to wear heels and would definitely make your sister ah AH but it still seems like you could\u2019ve tried harder to find something better than crocs", "The time restraint made it really difficult because it all happened the day before the wedding. I would have only had an hour to look for something, everything shuts really early and thats assuming I can find something in Ambleside. I didn't have the time to go to the next big town over and look. Also like everyone was busy seeing family so no-one could drive and look with me and I didn't feel comfortable with driving on my ankle. I would have looked if I had more time but that hour would have been a push alone"]}
