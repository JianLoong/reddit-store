We always had a good relationship for decades even though we moved to far away cities. \n\nHer husband Aaron (36M) has his own startup company built from scratch and is quite a workaholic. When I quit my job 2 years ago, she offered me a job in her husband's firm where she also works.\n\nOne day, she called me crying. Apparently, she had texted a guy months ago then felt guilty and stopped, deleted the texts. Aaron just found out, instantly fired her. put divorce papers and Threatened her with not showing the kids. telling kids their mother cheated if she did not sign the papers.\n\nYou know, I was still a good friend to her during all this. I was like, you made a mistake yes, but it doesn't mean you should be homeless. I mean, I hate cheaters but, I get it.. in a way at least. He neglected her way too long. he was her first boyfriend and I get why she might wonder if grass was greener. All good reasons to divorce tho not cheating. \n\nShe agreed to most of his demands, and he calmed down.She did some meditation stuff and forgave herself. And She was happy as clam 3 weeks later. \n\nMeanwhile, Aaron, started rethinking the decisions Sarah made for the company. I asked Aaron if I should brace myself for dismissal, since she hired me. He assured me, \"we are profesionals, you provide value.\"  \nso, I rejected a good paying a job offer.

I texted back, Aaron lied to me multiple times, I do not need his words, I need actions.

They are not good people.", "Atleast in the US this would be easy to collect. The corporate veil doesn't really apply to not paying your employees. She can collect it from Aaron.", "If OP is in the US, Aaron can get fined heavily & even charged with a misdemeanor with an additional fine for not paying immediately. My cousin had a company that refused to pay him two weeks wages (he\u2019s a truck driver) and they got slammed by the labor board as well as Class B misdemeanor with a $500 fine. So the $800 he was owed ended up costing them $4000 with attorney fees, fines  and a criminal record.", "Sounds like there is more to that story, texting a man does not constitute cheating, although, questionable behavior, he can\u2019t just fire her if the business was formed with marital assets, she shouldn\u2019t have rolled over and accepted his bogus requirements for the divorce and he sounds like a major AH, only downside is OP missed out on another opportunity but they are lucky to get away from that snake and massive dumpster fire.", "By my country's law, he has to pay me for firing me for no reason (for 2 years of employment approx. 4 times my salary). The only exception would be if I have a performance issue that I failed to solve despite all his efforts to train me. Or if I commit a shameful act like taking bribes or something, which is not the case.\n\nthere is no law about 15 days, that is a plain lie, as my lawyer said. But lawyer missed something. I cannot sue him. He is a small company under 30 employees. The law assumes he may not have the means to pay me due to the small size of the company. The law tries to protect like small restaurants etc, but this guy works with AI and stuff and all his employees are coders... He doesn't need to hire people, he earns millions just with few people owns multiple homes and luxury cars.\n\nso I cannot sue him for wrongful termination or reemployment lawsuit due to company size. All I can do is debt collection lawsuit saying this guy owes me this much money. Which will probably drag on too much and I will end up with less money for giving lawyers.\n\nI know I am not TA towards Aaron. but I wasn't sure for being that harsh to Sarah since she indeed going through hard times and may fail to be a good friend to me due to these stressful days.\n\nFunny thing is, he didn't need to pay me anything if he could just be honest and said he wasn't sure he wanted to work with me anymore in that meeting. I would just accept other firm's offer and quit myself.", "So you never got paid?"]}
