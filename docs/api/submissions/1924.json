She said she didn't want hers, because it wasn't white (pastel pink) and my body and hers were more similar. \n\nI said I didn't want to, because even though we have similar bodies, it would need adjustment in the breasts and hips area. I don't want to \"modify\" the dress. But that I could borrow her the veil so she can have something from our mother. \n\n\nShe started complaining, saying that it wouldn't hurt me to borrow the dress, the adjustments would be minimal, she was the only one of the sisters who can't have something done by our mom and she basically has to turn to me to get something of hers. She practically begged me to borrow the dress. \n\nI feel bad for her, but I really don''t want to modify something in the dress, because it's a memory of my mom and one of the best days of my life, it was just for me. In the face of all this, I don't feel comfortable borrowing the dress, but that I could make the concession of the veil. \n\nShe walked away crying after I stood by my decision, saying that I was being selfish not to allow her to have any feeling close to having something done for our mother and not being able to share something so special with her too, when she never will have something close to that.\n\n People are calling me an AH (our father, fianc\u00e9 and in-laws - except my older sister who didn't chose \"sides\")\n\nAITA?\n\nExtra: It's not a dress I wear all the time ofc, but it's literally something that is unique to each daughter. The 3 of us have flower names, on my dress and my older sister's had details of our flowers. Modifying something so unique made entirely by my mother, someone else would come and modify it, it's really very difficult for me.", "created_utc": 1668041729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yr0y2p/aita_for_refusing_to_borrow_my_wedding_made_by_my/", "score": 1113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why don't you and your sister have a dress made for her with the flowers of her name on it - so while it won't be from your mom, it will be from her \"big sisters\". Honestly you not TA and hopefully she will accept this.", "NAH. I\u2019m so sorry for both of you. She\u2019s right that it isn\u2019t fair that she won\u2019t get a dress, but you would be losing yours. I think the veil is a good compromise if your mother made that as well. Or do you have your mother\u2019s dress?", "NAH - Honestly, my heart breaks for both of you. You don\u2019t want to change something your mother did for you. She doesn\u2019t want to be the only one without something made by your mother. It\u2019s just really sad and you\u2019re both hurting, and both want your mama. That\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t go away.\n\nI completely understand you not wanting to let her borrow the dress and you are definitely not obligated to. You made the choice that feels right to you and that\u2019s admirable. Though I understand your sister getting emotional as well, she wants a piece of her mom with her too and just feels sad that she can\u2019t share this memory with her.\n\nYou don\u2019t really have any advice other than to be kind to each other right now. You\u2019re both going through a lot of pain and grief and you need each other\u2019s support through this. Would it be possible to commission a dress that matches your mom\u2019s design? It won\u2019t be the same but it\u2019ll have a bit of the spirit in there. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re both going through this.", "NAH. You may not wear the dress but it\u2019s a memento that you don\u2019t want modified and you conceded to let her wear the veil. Is there anything of your mothers you could incorporate into a different dress?", "NTA. It would have been N A H, but your sister decided to get family to start attacking you.\n\nI feel for your sister, to not be able to have her gorgeous dress made for her by her mother. It's not fair that your mother can't be there.\n\nHowever, the circumstances of life do not entitle your sister to the dress your mother made for you. Would it be a beautiful gesture on your part? Of course. But the fact is that your dress has a great deal of meaning to you that the required alterations could ruin. It's a special thing between you and your mother. Your sister's inability to have one of her own is not your responsibility.", "I can definitely see both sides to this...but ultimately I don't think OP is an AH.\nI don't think there's any AH in this situation. The sister feels left out because the mother died, a situation no one could control or change. Obviously her feelings are valid. But so are yours. This would be taking away from your special thing since she would be doing some altering, whether or not it's small. You want to have the memory of your mom, which is reasonable.As long as you were kind to your sister, which you seem to have been based on the story, you're NTA.", "NAH just a sad, painful situation for both of you. Understandable for her to ask, and absolutely justified for you to say no. Just be compassionate for each other \ud83d\udc95", "NTA. It's heartbreaking because I can see there isn't a solution that works. \n\nSince your mother made the dresses surely she was a wonderful seamstress. Did she make anything else for any of you that could be part of her \"something old\"? It absolutely isn't the same thing but it might still help her pain a little.", "INFO: would the dress need to be taken in or let out? If taken in, this can be done with a running stitch and easily removed without damaging the dress. You could offer for her to wear it to the ceremony then change for the reception, if that\u2019s the case.", "Mild YTA.  She asked, you refused which was your right to do.  However, from her POV she was NEVER going to have that connection to a mother that she too had lost.\n\nI get that the dress is special to you. You\u2019ve made it clear that it means more to you than your flesh and blood sister.  So when your relationship falls apart, take comfort in knowing that a piece of material is still in tact to keep you company.  Rather than sharing the special bond you had with your mother with your sister.\n\nAgain, she asked.  You refused.  And that was your selfish right to do, but it was an AH move.", "NAH - I can't imagine how hard this must be for all of you. My only consideration would be that yes of course this is hard for you, it sounds like your mom and wedding were amazing. Your sister can't have that same emotional connection with a dress made specifically for her but even worse she has to have her wedding without your mom there at all, which has to cast a shadow over her hopefully amazing day. \n\nOf course you're not the asshole, the dress is yours to do with what you want, but I myself couldn't imagine denying my sister that sliver of my moms' presence when you got to have not just a dress made just for you, but your mom there herself. I hope whatever ends up happening you all are able to heal and honor your mom, my condolences.", "NTA. Its very sad but the dress is symbolic for you, it was made for you, I don't understand why even the in-laws have to talk about something that doesn't concern them.\n\nIn these reddit posts I see that entitled people have no respect for the loss and memory of others. You don't have to lend it, it's not your fault she had a different fate.", "NTA it's your wedding dress and you don't need to share it", "NAH. What a heartbreaking dilemma though. I\u2019d like to give you some food for thought though\u2026 as an old woman with her wedding dress stuffed in a garment bag (25+ years \ud83d\udcaa married), surrounded by even OLDER women with their wedding dresses stuffed in a bag (50++ years \ud83d\udcaa married)\u2026 we were discussing what to do with them. Not like I\u2019ll be buried in it. Nor will my mom. Nor will my sister nor 93 year old aunt \u2026 (most of us no longer weigh what we wore aallllll those years ago). It\u2019s a burden to have our kids try to keep track of them or store them. And to be honest, with the exception of my aunts, styles, fabric and craftsmanship has changed so much that even in a quality controlled environment, they\u2019d all probably rip on contact. If I\u2019d known now what I didn\u2019t know then, I would\u2019ve happily donated my dress (as we all agreed) and let someone else enjoy the poofy satiny and bunched up hot mess that was *de rigueur* for our respective time (princess D\u2019s poofy sleeves had nuthin\u2019 on me! And yes I still look at my photos and cringe, lol.) The bonus for you is you get to donate that to your flesh and blood and your mom will probably be thrilled and smiling somewhere. Just food for thought, OP.\n\nETA for my atrocious grammar. Which clearly is still cringy even post edits. Oh well.", "NTA But Def not being empathetic", "NTA your sister isn\u2019t entitled to your dress. It\u2019s yours to cherish and keep. Do not let anyone guilt you into doing something your not comfortable with.", "Nta I can understand your sister asking but you are under no obligation to loan it to her. She should have dropped it when you said no.", "NTA. It was something special that your mother made for you, especially all the small details she included personally for just you. \n\nIs your mother's wedding dress still around? If so, maybe have your sister borrow that dress since it was your mother's and could be a special moment for her", "NTA.\n\n\nIt's yours, so you can decide whether she can borrow it or not. She's gaslighting you. I understand that she wants to wear something your Mom made, but she also needs to understand and respect your decision.", "NTA.  I'm so sorry for your loss.  It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.    Is there any part of you that wants to loan her the dress?  What would your mom want?  Maybe the seamstress could alter it so it could be changed back.  Even if your sister borrows the dress, it still will have been made just for you. You could tell your sister you want the dress back after the wedding.\n\nThe big question is, will you be sorry later if you say no?  It is ultimately up to you.  You are the one who needs to be comfortable with the decison long term.  Not the AH if you can't do it.  Just encouraging you to really consider it before you say no.  Apologies if even asking these questions is offensive.", "You and your sister should just contribute funds to a new dress. She wants the sentiment, not the actual dress. I would pay to have something of your moms sewn into a wedding dress you and your sister help her buy. Like a heart from one of her blue dresses. Her jewelry, etc. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nThe dress was made to be unique to your name by the flowers on it, and lending it to your sister will result in changes, I totally get it.    If she said there were be NO MODIFICATIONS to the dress I would think that maybe she should get to wear it, but something so sentimental and special shouldn't be modified in order for someone to borrow it.\n\n\nYou offered her the veil.  \n\n\nWhat I do suggest she do is take pictures of it and see if she can one custom made for her that is just like what you mother made.  No it's not the same, but if it were me I wouldn't want to wear a dress that my mom made special for someone else, if I could not have her do it, then I'd find another way to have a dress made and provide pictures so I could have some of the designs could be incorporated.", "NAH. I get that the dress is special to you because your mum made it, and it was part of your wedding day. That's what your sister wants  too. Except she can't have her own dress, so she's asked to borrow yours. \nI know it may need alterations, but that won't take away the memories of the dress or your wedding. You have it in your power to do something very special for your sister. Few of us have these chances and choices in our lives, you may never again have the opportunity to impact someone's life in such a positive way.", "Nta\n\nIt sucks for your sister. But altering a dress would no longer make it the dress your  mother made.i cam understand that. \n\nThis is a no win situation for someone. \n\nYou offered the vail to compromise.", "Nta... It's your dress... But.... Do you wear this dress? Outside of it sitting in the closet gathering dust... at least this way it would get to be worn again..what would your mom want? What would she say to your denial? What would it be like to see her in it? I'd think long and hard about the way this could be a way to see your mom's memory and work come alive again. But, I also understand how this dress is so important to you.", "NAH. You\u2019re in a difficult situation, and I understand how important the dress is to you. However, your sister lost her mom too, and her wedding is probably another reminder of something that you guys\u2019 mom missed out on. If the dress is not being used for the foreseeable future, I could see compromising so long as the adjustments are minimal, but if you\u2019re attached to the dress, are there other things you could compromise on besides the veil?", "NTA\nIf you lend her you are unlikely to get it back.", "I'm so sorry for your l loss!  NTA. It's your dress, made by your mother specifically for you, and you get to decide what happens to it. It's sad you're younger sister isn't able to have her own dress, but modifying your dress to fit won't make it her own unique dress. You offered a reasonable compromise to allow her to use your veil and she's unwilling to accept that, or ask your older sister to borrow her dress.", "NTA", "NTA, it sucks, and it's unfair, but is also not your fault.\n\nI'm paranoid, and this wouldn't be the first time something like this happens, buuuuuttt....\n\nSecure your dress as best as you can. Make sure only you (And your husband?) has access to it, or one day you might find it gone because someone wanted to make things \"fair\"\n\nI would be also very wary of actually lending her your dress, as you mention it was very personalized, sister could modify more than the size and then she will say it's \"her\" dress now that it was modified. Even if she swears she will only adjust the size, I wouldn't believe it. \n\nBest of Luck", "NAH. It seems that your sister got emotionally reactive as a result of her grief.

Like a necklace or something?", "Nah. I see both sides.\n\nThsts super meaningful.for you but...\nI really do feel for her. If I was in your shoes, truthfully, I would have let her wear it if I had a good relationship with her.\n\nI'd feel like my mom would have wanted me to be a kind sibling and I just honestly really disagree with your choice.  I don't think your an ah because grief is hard and I get you are attached to it.", "NTA but honestly I think it\u2019s sad you can\u2019t share this with your sister. She can\u2019t have what you did, and let\u2019s be honest you\u2019re not going to wear you dress again. \nIt\u2019s yours, no one can force you and you have to do what\u2019s right for you, I just can understand your sister\u2019s emotions.", "NAH - but you're telling your family that you love the dress from your deceased mother more than you love your living sister who also misses her mother.\n\nAgain...at this point NAH, but that's why they are calling you the AH.  \n\nHopefully you can all work it out.  I'm sorry for your loss.", "Slight YTA. \n\nI assume this is your mum\u2019s daughter too and not the usual AITA for not lending the veil/necklace that my step-sister wants from the side of the fam that isn\u2019t ours\u2026\n\nIf that is the case, this poor girl is walking in at a disadvantage. She won\u2019t have HER OWN MOTHER there that day, and she knows there are minimal alterations involved in the ask. \n\nIf you\u2019re holding on to the dress for a future daughter (also needing alterations, btw) and are worried about reception stains, why don\u2019t you compromise?

I don\u2019t know how close you are, but I would worry about damage to the relationship going forward. Will it be worth it?", "NTA and the people calling you an AH are AHs, sucks that she won't get a dress specially made for her by your mom but wearing yours wouldn't change that, damaging your mother's gift to you. Just lending her the veil would be generous and frankly she doesn't deserve even that for how she reacted to your refusal.", "YTA. Let your sister have that connection to your and her mother on her big day. The dress is a memento, not the actual memory. You can keep the veil.\n\nETA: Soft YTA though. You both lost your mother, and it wasn\u2019t that long ago. Maybe this can bring you closer together.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t wrong of your sister to ask, but she should have accepted your no and stopped pushing the matter. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re going to use the dress again or not.

But your sister never has a chance at that and this could be it. Also do you plan to wear it? Do you have it out looking at it all the time? Or is it packed away doing nothing? \n\nOn the other hand you did offer the veil something from your mom as well as a way to have something from her on her wedding day. Her begging you when you have said no also sucks. She needs to respect that it is yours and you can choose what you want to do with it.", "NTA but would you be able to help your sister get a replica made, and she can alter that one as she likes ?", "NAH. This is a really horrible situation and I feel bad for both you and your sister. But that dress is something special to you and I don't blame you for wanting to preserve it. At the same time I understand why your sister wants this dress and it's sad she never got an opportunity to have one made by her mum.", "NTA. While I sympathize with your sister, she is asking too much. Can you and your older sister contribute to having a copy of  your dress made in the correct size and with the correct flowers for your youngest sister? Combined with the borrowed veil, it can be her something borrowed and something new? Again, sympathize with everyone here, but your younger sister missing out on a mother made dress does NOT give her the right to yours...", "NAH. \n\nIt was brave of her to communicate her wants, and perfectly acceptable for you to maintain your boundary. \n\nYour family are being assholes for choosing a side, this is a no-win situation. \n\nFor a solution - do you know if your mother kept the patterns and designs for yours and your other sister\u2019s wedding dresses? If she did, perhaps your father still has them if her sewing things are still in the house. Or if her sewing things went to another person, the patterns may be there. Sewing people are hoarders with their patterns.

You\u2019re being selfish and greedy.", "I think YTA, it\u2019s a dress, most likely not something you will wear again, and you could probably get adjustments made that could be undone.

I can empathize your stance but also your sisters. Losing a mother is difficult as you both clearly cherish each others individual relationships with her however I would encourage/suggest sharing her memory together? Parents and extend family will pass way and the best way to foster love for them is sharing it with others. If you value your relationship with your sister maybe it\u2019s best to lend her the dress? Would your mom support this alternative instead?", "YTA - You are lucky to have a healthy little sister to share it with, and you seem to value the dress more than your relationship with her. If \u201cmodifying\u201d the dress is actually that important to you, perhaps you could simply request your sister cover the alterations to have it re-fitted to you (just in case you get married again or something?) It\u2019s obviously your possession - and you are entitled to do whatever you like with it, just do so with open eyes, and understand that relationships tend to be more valuable than possessions over time.", "NTA but there are no winners.

Not to mention it\u2019s your flower embroidered. \nBut I feel for your sister. It has to be so hard to lose your mom before your wedding especially when your sister got handmade dresses from her. I thought the offer of the veil was very thoughtful. Perhaps your other sister has another item of your mothers she can share with her and it will be like two parts of mom there for her, one from each of you. There has to be some way to compromise. \nI do think it was very unfair of her to get everyone to harass you about it.", "Info: if the dress did not need to be altered would you allow your sister to wear it?", "NTA. And don\u2019t listen to these people\u2026it\u2019s your dress. Doesn\u2019t matter if you wear it or not.

What would your mom want you to do? I'm guessing she'd hope you would share the dress she so lovingly made. Maybe you were just surprised by the request and need some time to grieve the loss of your mom in this moment. It's not the dress you're attached to. It's your mom. Share with your sister graciously. Maybe you can have a section of the dress made into something pretty for yourself and give the rest to your sister to modify with her own flowers.", "Nah", "If it were my sister, I would lend her the dress and love the dress all the more for her wearing it.  It sounds like your sister is will to compromise on the alterations.  It is your dress but what would your mom want you to do?", "NTA and WTF is with all the NAH. Sorry to be the one to say it but your mom is no longer able to provide that gift to your sister and that's not anyone's fault. But it also isn't OP responsibility to step up to the plate to give her younger sister a memory that doesn't belong to her. It's time to make new memories hence why she is getting married.", "NTA. \nIt's your dress. You offered her the veil. That's more than enough. \nYour family is being ridiculous.", "NAH. It\u2019s your choice, but man, your poor sister. I would really think about trying to let this happen. You won\u2019t ever wear the dress again. It will still be something special to you. You\u2019ll still have the dress, and the pictures. Your sister will have to pick something else out and know that she losing more of her mom. What would your mom want you to do?", "INFO: is your dress obviously a wedding dress? Do you plan to ever wear it again, like to a cocktail party?", "NTA while it was ok for your sister to ask it needed to end there. I understand her sorrow and grief by not having a dress made by your mother as your other sisters did but it is not anyones fault.\n\nCan you and your other sisters come together to help create something for your sister? Is there a bit of fabric you each would be able to cut out if your dresses that could be down into her dress (only if you\u2019re all comfortable). I think coming together with your other sisters and tossing ideas around to try to help would at least show your sister that you care.", "NTA!! It\u2019s your dress, unique and made for you. No matter what you never owe anyone your possessions. You tried to compromise with the veil and she said no. Surely there are other things of her mothers like jewelry or something that she can use to feel like her mother is close. Anything but your dress, don\u2019t let anyone guilt you into it!", "I really hope OP reads this. My mom passed before I met my husband, so it really hurts that he never met her and that she never knew I found someone lovely after a couple of real AHs. It was also REALLY hard to plan a wedding without her. She was able to be there every step of the way for my sister, and I felt kind of lost.  \n\nLuckily my sister stepped up. She was there to help me find a dress, came with me to seamstress appointments, gave me things of my grandmas that she\u2019d inherited as my something borrowed and old, and really just channeled my mom so that I wouldn\u2019t feel alone or sad. \n\nIf they can make the time to help her find the perfect dress, find someone who can alter it with a flower, lend some other things from mom, and just do the things mom did for them\u2026it can really go along way to make the day not feel like a big part is missing.", "This is a lovely idea. If having a dress commissioned may be a financial burden, perhaps your dad could help. Or, maybe he would just want to be involved as a tribute to your mom.", "THIS is a beautiful idea. Perhaps you can help sis with wedding dress shopping. It won't be mom's creation, but to honor her. She can have her flowers on the dress and other memories of mom. That way this dress would be unique and also paying homage to her. I'll go with NAH.", "I was going to ask this, are there any accessories associated with mom? A necklace, a ring? \n\nI don't think your sister was an AH to ask, and I don't think you're an AH to say no, so I agree with NAH, but I do think it's a no-win situation.", "I agree this is so sad. And I totally understand both perspectives. I agree the veil is a good compromise, but perhaps sis can also find other ways to honor mom at the wedding and OP and older sis can assist with this. I do hope the sisters work it out. NAH.", "She offered her veil, so she would have that sliver of her mom. I agree, it\u2019s awful and heartbreaking in several ways.", "I feel like if the younger sister is being this pushy to get the dress, she isn\u2019t going to want to give it back.

It's hard to tell from such a short account but it seems like there's still a lot of healing needed in their whole family, hopefully they get there together.", "It\u2019s something her late mother made for her. It\u2019s understandable that she wouldn\u2019t want to see it modified. People grieve in different ways and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. For one person the right choice would be sharing the dress, for another the right choice is to hold onto it. Neither choice is wrong inherently, it depends on the person.", "Goodness, I hope you don\u2019t have siblings because you clearly wouldn\u2019t care about them at all.", "NTA. You stood by your decision, you\u2019re not an asshole for that. I\u2019d stand your ground too.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s a very sad situation, because your mother couldn\u2019t make one for your sister, she had *no right* to force you to do something you didn\u2019t want to do. This dress is sentimental to you and was made for you specifically, and you don\u2019t want to change that- that\u2019s a good enough excuse.\n\nThat\u2019s why I say NTA and not N A H like some have said. Your sister should\u2019ve dropped the conversation when you obviously weren\u2019t willing to budge. Offering the veil is honestly a good thing to do, and perhaps she could copy the style of yours (and other sister\u2019s dress as well maybe) to make it similar to mother\u2019s style. Her getting everyone to be against you is also an AH move, making you feel guilty for saying no.", "NTA", "NTA. It's not YOUR fault that she did not receive a dress. You offering the veil was kind enough. She could have appreciated it, but instead she kept complaining. Wrong of her imo.

You have a strong attachment to the dress, and she doesn\u2019t, she just likes the idea of it.\n\nI can\u2019t help but think that there is more going on here?  Is there, or has there been, much competition between the two of you?  Is one of you the favoured child?  It kinda of sounds like she\u2019s trying to take away a happy memory from you rather than make a happy memory of her own.  The whole thing sounds manipulative and entitled on her part.", "No judgement, difficult situation, but what would your mum want? (Hypothetical question).", "YTA\n\nShe was her mom too right? Remember how you felt when you got the dress? If it was anyone else then it's fine, but she is your sister. It's not like she is going to keep ot forever.

Anyway it's your decision.", "NTA.  A wedding dress is sacred, and one handmade by a mother is even more so.  Not to be cruel, but: a) no one could have known when your mother would pass; if she thought she was going to pass so early she probably would have made Jess's dress ahead of time; 2) it's not your problem or your other sister's problem that Jess got engaged when it was too late for your mother to make a dress.

It's understandable she was upset when you said no. Buttttt I do think she's an asshole for throwing a tantrum when you said no. She is being very \"all or nothing\" about it. It was kind of you to offer your veil to give her something to feel close to mom on her wedding day. But that's not good enough? It has to be your dress.

I watched them both get prom dresses, homecoming dresses, graduation dresses, and wedding dresses. I watched  them get wedding quilts, baby blankets, and baby clothes. I watched them get to have HER at all of their major life milestones. I got nothing. \n\nShe was missing from every milestone and life event that I had. Neither of them were kind enough to ever allow me to borrow a dress or to give me single square of their quilts.

Alternatively, you and your sister could each take a bit of fabric from both your dresses and have a new dress made for your sister.

You could make it a condition to get the dress back, or not make permanent alterations. I can\u2019t help but think if your mother made two wedding dresses, she\u2019d have made other personal things for you in your lifetime. How would your mom have felt about this?

You will always have that special gift from your mom and perfect wedding day with your whole family. Your sister won't even have your mom there alive to watch her walk down the aisle. \n\nIm not saying you should give away the dress, but some minor modifications to the dress won't tarnish the memory of your mom making you your perfect wedding dress and wont destroy it so you will still be able to keep it forever.

Maybe even alter another dress together if that\u2019s possible.", "NTA I can understand not wanting to alter it because then someone else's stitching goes in it. I think you were very kind to offer the veil. \n\nMaybe offer to give her the veil if you want to be extra compassionate. That way she can keep something you're mother made from her wedding. This has to be a really hard time for her not to have her mother there with her as she's getting married.", "NTA. The dress is personal to you and one specifically made to your uniqueness, it's awful that your sister didn't get that experience herself but it's alright to be selfish with something that means so much to you.", "NTA. \n\nI get her desire. I really do, because cancer took your mother away from all of you and it really sucks that she didn\u2019t get a dress. \n\nThat being said, she\u2019s not entitled to yours. It\u2019s your special dress. It\u2019s a very pure item, in a sense, straight from your mother to you, *for you*, and not another one like it. \nHer putting it on in the first place breaks that specialness outright,and she expects you to let her tear it apart to fit her instead? That makes it more *her* dress than yours, in a way. \n\nI\u2019m the same way as you with sentimental items like that. I don\u2019t blame you for saying no at all, because I would too.

Your sister knows what the dress means to you but asking to borrow it and it being so special would bring you into this experience for her too.

How about a compromise? If you know a really good seamstress, someone you trust, maybe you allow only that person to make the minor adjustments?

Could you and your older sister maybe get together and have a dress made for your younger sister's wedding? Get the flower details you mentioned, have it made to her liking. It might not be plausible, as it could be pretty pricey. It also wouldn't be exactly the same since it didn't come from your mom. But maybe if it was a gift from both of you, and you lend her your veil, plus your older sister loans her an accessory she wore in her wedding, it might be almost as good. It could be your guys' gift to her. I'm sorry for the loss of your mother, and I wish all three of you lovely ladies the best no matter what happens next.", "Yeah, it's heartbreaking. There might be a dress unique to each daughter, but not one for *every* daughter. And I fully see that a veil is just not the same. OP, do any other members of the family sew? Is there an old wedding dress of your mom's, that could be pulled out and turned into something for your sister? Because just washing your hands clean of the situation might not be an option here. She misses her too, and she never got the experince your sister and you cherish so much. That has to fucking sting.", "I agree it's NAH, but honestly do women actually wear their dresses again? Or do they just collect dust in the closet forever? Seems like a good use of the dress to lend it to your sister, but not an AH to keep it for herself.", " I don't think there's any AH in this situation. The sister feels left out because the mother died, a situation no one could control or change.", "Just so you know in the future, if there\u2019s no AH in the situation as you say, it\u2019s NAH otherwise NTA would state the opposing party (sister in this case) is an AH", "Formal gowns absolutely do not work like this.", "This one, although I don't think it's mild - it's just YTA.  OP has had so much more than her sister with regards to their mother.  OP has had the experience of spending time with her mom planning, designing, and making the dress - OP's sister will never have that.  OP has had the experience of having her mother help her plan her entire wedding - OP's sister will never have that.  OP has had the experience of having her mother at her wedding, celebrating her joy.  OP got to wear a dress made by her mother which had flowers that resonated with her name.  OP had a mother who met and got to know her boyfriend, then fiance, then husband, and got to share those special moments with her mom.  OP likely has special memories of these times with her mother.  OP's sister has had none of those special times.  OP has an opportunity to create a special shared memory and bond with her sister.  Yet, OP seems more worried about where an embroidered flower is on a garment she likely will never wear again than she is about seriously damaging her relationship with her sister.  You sound extremely selfish, OP - my guess is this action is revealing your true colors to your family members.", "I agree. To me, it would be so nice to share the dress with my sister. Being able to share that special connection with our mom in the sharing of the dress.", "lmao not letting someone alter and use your belongings isnt selfish and greedy, it would actually be the other way around", "We have no reason to think that OP\u2019s sister would keep the dress - OP obviously knows her sister better than any of us, and presumably if she suspected her sister would pull something like that, she would\u2019ve mentioned it as part of her decision-making process.\n\nI hardly think asking to borrow something sentimental, made by your dead mother who won\u2019t be able to see her get married, makes the sister a bully.", "Undoing changes is not always possible.

It seems like it's just a \"you\" problem.", "Since your mother made the dresses surely she was a wonderful seamstress.", " Its very sad but the dress is symbolic for you, it was made for you, I don't understand why even the in-laws have to talk about something that doesn't concern them.", "Now it's a bad mojo dress if lent, there would still be drama.

I understand the instinct, but YTA", "That's a brilliant idea!\n\nAnd also reach out to any family that might have items if significance your sister could borrow.\n\nI get why you don't want to lend your dress AND as the youngest sister in my family I understand why this means a lot to your sister.\n\nI can gradp why she would prefer yours to your older sister.  BUT if it's really about connection to your mom I'm stymied that she wouldn't use a dress made by your mother that is available.", "This, OP. I believe this would be the best compromise. Have a dress made that resembles very closely how your mom would have made it. Then you and your sister can lend her an accessory from each of your wedding.", "This is an excellent suggestion!", "I was thinking if the mom had left fabric behind that can be sewed on the inside of the dress. Or if the flowers in the dresses were 3d maybe each sister would be willing to give one to the sister, that way younger sister can have a flower representing her made by the fabric of an old shirt of mom and the two flowers from the sisters dresses sewed onto the dress that were made by mom", "Sister\u2019s appeal sounded less pushy/entitled to me and more\u2026 desperately sad.  \n\nYou may very well be right, but I think it\u2019s also worth considering that AITA has made us all way more cynical", "I don't have the greatest relationship with my sisters, and it also seems like a no-brainer to me. Truthfully it seems cruel not to let the sister alter and wear it, especially since she never got the chance to get a dress from their mom. Surely it's what their mom would have wanted too. OP has no use for the dress anymore, so it would be great to give it such a meaningful purpose. Then she could give it new life after by preserving and displaying the personalized flower details, maybe by framing the embroidery. It's not like OP will wear it again, so why not keep her mom's memory alive and honor her? I think the sister, who is also grieving and clearly thought OP would understand the sentiment behind her request, must be incredibly hurt by this.", "Agreed. Not to mention- it was obviously moms intention to eventually make younger sister her dress when the time came, but unfortunately mom is no longer here to fulfill that dream she had for her daughters.. \nthere\u2019s no way a mom like that would\u2019ve stopped at 2/3 daughters\u2026 if OP doesn\u2019t want to do it for her sister- fine, that\u2019s one thing. \n\nOP should consider doing this for her mother who clearly wished to make 3/3.", "And it\u2019s not like she wears the dress.
