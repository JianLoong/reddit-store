She said she didn't want hers, because it wasn't white (pastel pink) and my body and hers were more similar. \n\nI said I didn't want to, because even though we have similar bodies, it would need adjustment in the breasts and hips area. I don't want to \"modify\" the dress. But that I could borrow her the veil so she can have something from our mother. \n\n\nShe started complaining, saying that it wouldn't hurt me to borrow the dress, the adjustments would be minimal, she was the only one of the sisters who can't have something done by our mom and she basically has to turn to me to get something of hers. She practically begged me to borrow the dress. \n\nI feel bad for her, but I really don''t want to modify something in the dress, because it's a memory of my mom and one of the best days of my life, it was just for me. In the face of all this, I don't feel comfortable borrowing the dress, but that I could make the concession of the veil. \n\nShe walked away crying after I stood by my decision, saying that I was being selfish not to allow her to have any feeling close to having something done for our mother and not being able to share something so special with her too, when she never will have something close to that.\n\n People are calling me an AH (our father, fianc\u00e9 and in-laws - except my older sister who didn't chose \"sides\")\n\nAITA?\n\nExtra: It's not a dress I wear all the time ofc, but it's literally something that is unique to each daughter. The 3 of us have flower names, on my dress and my older sister's had details of our flowers. Modifying something so unique made entirely by my mother, someone else would come and modify it, it's really very difficult for me.", "created_utc": 1668041729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yr0y2p/aita_for_refusing_to_borrow_my_wedding_made_by_my/", "score": 181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why don't you and your sister have a dress made for her with the flowers of her name on it - so while it won't be from your mom, it will be from her \"big sisters\". Honestly you not TA and hopefully she will accept this.", "NAH. I\u2019m so sorry for both of you. She\u2019s right that it isn\u2019t fair that she won\u2019t get a dress, but you would be losing yours. I think the veil is a good compromise if your mother made that as well. Or do you have your mother\u2019s dress?", "NAH - Honestly, my heart breaks for both of you. You don\u2019t want to change something your mother did for you. She doesn\u2019t want to be the only one without something made by your mother. It\u2019s just really sad and you\u2019re both hurting, and both want your mama. That\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t go away.\n\nI completely understand you not wanting to let her borrow the dress and you are definitely not obligated to. You made the choice that feels right to you and that\u2019s admirable. Though I understand your sister getting emotional as well, she wants a piece of her mom with her too and just feels sad that she can\u2019t share this memory with her.\n\nYou don\u2019t really have any advice other than to be kind to each other right now. You\u2019re both going through a lot of pain and grief and you need each other\u2019s support through this. Would it be possible to commission a dress that matches your mom\u2019s design? It won\u2019t be the same but it\u2019ll have a bit of the spirit in there. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re both going through this.", "NAH. You may not wear the dress but it\u2019s a memento that you don\u2019t want modified and you conceded to let her wear the veil. Is there anything of your mothers you could incorporate into a different dress?", "NTA. It would have been N A H, but your sister decided to get family to start attacking you.\n\nI feel for your sister, to not be able to have her gorgeous dress made for her by her mother. It's not fair that your mother can't be there.\n\nHowever, the circumstances of life do not entitle your sister to the dress your mother made for you. Would it be a beautiful gesture on your part? Of course. But the fact is that your dress has a great deal of meaning to you that the required alterations could ruin. It's a special thing between you and your mother. Your sister's inability to have one of her own is not your responsibility.", "I can definitely see both sides to this...but ultimately I don't think OP is an AH.\nI don't think there's any AH in this situation. The sister feels left out because the mother died, a situation no one could control or change. Obviously her feelings are valid. But so are yours. This would be taking away from your special thing since she would be doing some altering, whether or not it's small. You want to have the memory of your mom, which is reasonable.As long as you were kind to your sister, which you seem to have been based on the story, you're NTA.", "NAH just a sad, painful situation for both of you. Understandable for her to ask, and absolutely justified for you to say no. Just be compassionate for each other \ud83d\udc95", "NTA. It's heartbreaking because I can see there isn't a solution that works. \n\nSince your mother made the dresses surely she was a wonderful seamstress. Did she make anything else for any of you that could be part of her \"something old\"? It absolutely isn't the same thing but it might still help her pain a little.", "INFO: would the dress need to be taken in or let out? If taken in, this can be done with a running stitch and easily removed without damaging the dress. You could offer for her to wear it to the ceremony then change for the reception, if that\u2019s the case.", "Mild YTA.  She asked, you refused which was your right to do.  However, from her POV she was NEVER going to have that connection to a mother that she too had lost.\n\nI get that the dress is special to you. You\u2019ve made it clear that it means more to you than your flesh and blood sister.  So when your relationship falls apart, take comfort in knowing that a piece of material is still in tact to keep you company.  Rather than sharing the special bond you had with your mother with your sister.\n\nAgain, she asked.  You refused.  And that was your selfish right to do, but it was an AH move.", "NAH - I can't imagine how hard this must be for all of you. My only consideration would be that yes of course this is hard for you, it sounds like your mom and wedding were amazing. Your sister can't have that same emotional connection with a dress made specifically for her but even worse she has to have her wedding without your mom there at all, which has to cast a shadow over her hopefully amazing day. \n\nOf course you're not the asshole, the dress is yours to do with what you want, but I myself couldn't imagine denying my sister that sliver of my moms' presence when you got to have not just a dress made just for you, but your mom there herself. I hope whatever ends up happening you all are able to heal and honor your mom, my condolences.", "NTA. Its very sad but the dress is symbolic for you, it was made for you, I don't understand why even the in-laws have to talk about something that doesn't concern them.\n\nIn these reddit posts I see that entitled people have no respect for the loss and memory of others. You don't have to lend it, it's not your fault she had a different fate.", "NTA it's your wedding dress and you don't need to share it", "NAH. What a heartbreaking dilemma though. I\u2019d like to give you some food for thought though\u2026 as an old woman with her wedding dress stuffed in a garment bag (25+ years \ud83d\udcaa married), surrounded by even OLDER women with their wedding dresses stuffed in a bag (50++ years \ud83d\udcaa married)\u2026 we were discussing what to do with them. Not like I\u2019ll be buried in it. Nor will my mom. Nor will my sister nor 93 year old aunt \u2026 (most of us no longer weigh what we wore aallllll those years ago). It\u2019s a burden to have our kids try to keep track of them or store them. And to be honest, with the exception of my aunts, styles, fabric and craftsmanship has changed so much that even in a quality controlled environment, they\u2019d all probably rip on contact. If I\u2019d known now what I didn\u2019t know then, I would\u2019ve happily donated my dress (as we all agreed) and let someone else enjoy the poofy satiny and bunched up hot mess that was *de rigueur* for our respective time (princess D\u2019s poofy sleeves had nuthin\u2019 on me! And yes I still look at my photos and cringe, lol.) The bonus for you is you get to donate that to your flesh and blood and your mom will probably be thrilled and smiling somewhere. Just food for thought, OP.\n\nETA for my atrocious grammar. Which clearly is still cringy even post edits. Oh well.", "NTA But Def not being empathetic", "NTA your sister isn\u2019t entitled to your dress. It\u2019s yours to cherish and keep. Do not let anyone guilt you into doing something your not comfortable with.", "Nta I can understand your sister asking but you are under no obligation to loan it to her. She should have dropped it when you said no.", "NTA. It was something special that your mother made for you, especially all the small details she included personally for just you. \n\nIs your mother's wedding dress still around? If so, maybe have your sister borrow that dress since it was your mother's and could be a special moment for her", "NTA.\n\n\nIt's yours, so you can decide whether she can borrow it or not. She's gaslighting you. I understand that she wants to wear something your Mom made, but she also needs to understand and respect your decision.", "NTA.  I'm so sorry for your loss.  It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.    Is there any part of you that wants to loan her the dress?  What would your mom want?  Maybe the seamstress could alter it so it could be changed back.  Even if your sister borrows the dress, it still will have been made just for you. You could tell your sister you want the dress back after the wedding.\n\nThe big question is, will you be sorry later if you say no?  It is ultimately up to you.  You are the one who needs to be comfortable with the decison long term.  Not the AH if you can't do it.  Just encouraging you to really consider it before you say no.  Apologies if even asking these questions is offensive.", "You and your sister should just contribute funds to a new dress. She wants the sentiment, not the actual dress. I would pay to have something of your moms sewn into a wedding dress you and your sister help her buy. Like a heart from one of her blue dresses. Her jewelry, etc. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nThe dress was made to be unique to your name by the flowers on it, and lending it to your sister will result in changes, I totally get it.    If she said there were be NO MODIFICATIONS to the dress I would think that maybe she should get to wear it, but something so sentimental and special shouldn't be modified in order for someone to borrow it.\n\n\nYou offered her the veil.  \n\n\nWhat I do suggest she do is take pictures of it and see if she can one custom made for her that is just like what you mother made.  No it's not the same, but if it were me I wouldn't want to wear a dress that my mom made special for someone else, if I could not have her do it, then I'd find another way to have a dress made and provide pictures so I could have some of the designs could be incorporated.", "NAH. I get that the dress is special to you because your mum made it, and it was part of your wedding day. That's what your sister wants  too. Except she can't have her own dress, so she's asked to borrow yours. \nI know it may need alterations, but that won't take away the memories of the dress or your wedding. You have it in your power to do something very special for your sister. Few of us have these chances and choices in our lives, you may never again have the opportunity to impact someone's life in such a positive way.", "Nta\n\nIt sucks for your sister. But altering a dress would no longer make it the dress your  mother made.i cam understand that. \n\nThis is a no win situation for someone. \n\nYou offered the vail to compromise.", "Nta... It's your dress... But.... Do you wear this dress? Outside of it sitting in the closet gathering dust... at least this way it would get to be worn again..what would your mom want? What would she say to your denial? What would it be like to see her in it? I'd think long and hard about the way this could be a way to see your mom's memory and work come alive again. But, I also understand how this dress is so important to you.", "NAH. You\u2019re in a difficult situation, and I understand how important the dress is to you. However, your sister lost her mom too, and her wedding is probably another reminder of something that you guys\u2019 mom missed out on. If the dress is not being used for the foreseeable future, I could see compromising so long as the adjustments are minimal, but if you\u2019re attached to the dress, are there other things you could compromise on besides the veil?", "NTA\nIf you lend her you are unlikely to get it back.", "I'm so sorry for your l loss!  NTA. It's your dress, made by your mother specifically for you, and you get to decide what happens to it. It's sad you're younger sister isn't able to have her own dress, but modifying your dress to fit won't make it her own unique dress. You offered a reasonable compromise to allow her to use your veil and she's unwilling to accept that, or ask your older sister to borrow her dress.", "NTA", "NTA, it sucks, and it's unfair, but is also not your fault.\n\nI'm paranoid, and this wouldn't be the first time something like this happens, buuuuuttt....\n\nSecure your dress as best as you can. Make sure only you (And your husband?) has access to it, or one day you might find it gone because someone wanted to make things \"fair\"\n\nI would be also very wary of actually lending her your dress, as you mention it was very personalized, sister could modify more than the size and then she will say it's \"her\" dress now that it was modified. Even if she swears she will only adjust the size, I wouldn't believe it. \n\nBest of Luck", "NAH. It seems that your sister got emotionally reactive as a result of her grief.

I'm sorry for your loss.", "Slight YTA. \n\nI assume this is your mum\u2019s daughter too and not the usual AITA for not lending the veil/necklace that my step-sister wants from the side of the fam that isn\u2019t ours\u2026\n\nIf that is the case, this poor girl is walking in at a disadvantage.

Will it be worth it?", "NTA and the people calling you an AH are AHs, sucks that she won't get a dress specially made for her by your mom but wearing yours wouldn't change that, damaging your mother's gift to you.

While I sympathize with your sister, she is asking too much.

Again, sympathize with everyone here, but your younger sister missing out on a mother made dress does NOT give her the right to yours...", "NAH. \n\nIt was brave of her to communicate her wants, and perfectly acceptable for you to maintain your boundary. \n\nYour family are being assholes for choosing a side, this is a no-win situation. \n\nFor a solution - do you know if your mother kept the patterns and designs for yours and your other sister\u2019s wedding dresses? If she did, perhaps your father still has them if her sewing things are still in the house. Or if her sewing things went to another person, the patterns may be there. Sewing people are hoarders with their patterns.

In the face of all this, I don't feel comfortable borrowing the dress, but that I could make the concession of the veil. \n\nShe walked away crying after I stood by my decision, saying that I was being selfish not to allow her to have any feeling close to having something done for our mother and not being able to share something so special with her too, when she never will have something close to that.\n\n People are calling me an AH (our father, fianc\u00e9 and in-laws - except my older sister who didn't chose \"sides\")\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I thought the offer of the veil was very thoughtful. Perhaps your other sister has another item of your mothers she can share with her and it will be like two parts of mom there for her, one from each of you. There has to be some way to compromise. \nI do think it was very unfair of her to get everyone to harass you about it.", "Info: if the dress did not need to be altered would you allow your sister to wear it?", "NTA. And don\u2019t listen to these people\u2026it\u2019s your dress. Doesn\u2019t matter if you wear it or not. If it really was just about being close to your mom, she\u2019d borrow your other sister\u2019s dress.", "YTA. as long as she'll keep the dress in good care, you should let her borrow it.", "I can see why it would be hard but it would also be a beautiful gesture of kindness toward your sister. What would your mom want you to do? I'm guessing she'd hope you would share the dress she so lovingly made. Maybe you were just surprised by the request and need some time to grieve the loss of your mom in this moment. It's not the dress you're attached to. It's your mom. Share with your sister graciously. Maybe you can have a section of the dress made into something pretty for yourself and give the rest to your sister to modify with her own flowers.", "Nah", "If it were my sister, I would lend her the dress and love the dress all the more for her wearing it.  It sounds like your sister is will to compromise on the alterations.  It is your dress but what would your mom want you to do?", "NTA and WTF is with all the NAH. Sorry to be the one to say it but your mom is no longer able to provide that gift to your sister and that's not anyone's fault. But it also isn't OP responsibility to step up to the plate to give her younger sister a memory that doesn't belong to her. It's time to make new memories hence why she is getting married.", "NTA. \nIt's your dress. You offered her the veil. That's more than enough. \nYour family is being ridiculous.", "NAH. It\u2019s your choice, but man, your poor sister. I would really think about trying to let this happen. You won\u2019t ever wear the dress again. It will still be something special to you. You\u2019ll still have the dress, and the pictures. Your sister will have to pick something else out and know that she losing more of her mom. What would your mom want you to do?", "INFO: is your dress obviously a wedding dress? Do you plan to ever wear it again, like to a cocktail party?", "NTA while it was ok for your sister to ask it needed to end there. I understand her sorrow and grief by not having a dress made by your mother as your other sisters did but it is not anyones fault.\n\nCan you and your other sisters come together to help create something for your sister? Is there a bit of fabric you each would be able to cut out if your dresses that could be down into her dress (only if you\u2019re all comfortable). I think coming together with your other sisters and tossing ideas around to try to help would at least show your sister that you care.", "NTA!! It\u2019s your dress, unique and made for you. No matter what you never owe anyone your possessions. You tried to compromise with the veil and she said no. Surely there are other things of her mothers like jewelry or something that she can use to feel like her mother is close. Anything but your dress, don\u2019t let anyone guilt you into it!", "I really hope OP reads this. My mom passed before I met my husband, so it really hurts that he never met her and that she never knew I found someone lovely after a couple of real AHs. It was also REALLY hard to plan a wedding without her. She was able to be there every step of the way for my sister, and I felt kind of lost.  \n\nLuckily my sister stepped up. She was there to help me find a dress, came with me to seamstress appointments, gave me things of my grandmas that she\u2019d inherited as my something borrowed and old, and really just channeled my mom so that I wouldn\u2019t feel alone or sad. \n\nIf they can make the time to help her find the perfect dress, find someone who can alter it with a flower, lend some other things from mom, and just do the things mom did for them\u2026it can really go along way to make the day not feel like a big part is missing.", "This is a lovely idea. If having a dress commissioned may be a financial burden, perhaps your dad could help. Or, maybe he would just want to be involved as a tribute to your mom.", "THIS is a beautiful idea. Perhaps you can help sis with wedding dress shopping. It won't be mom's creation, but to honor her. She can have her flowers on the dress and other memories of mom. That way this dress would be unique and also paying homage to her. I'll go with NAH.", "I was going to ask this, are there any accessories associated with mom? A necklace, a ring? \n\nI don't think your sister was an AH to ask, and I don't think you're an AH to say no, so I agree with NAH, but I do think it's a no-win situation.", "I agree this is so sad. And I totally understand both perspectives. I agree the veil is a good compromise, but perhaps sis can also find other ways to honor mom at the wedding and OP and older sis can assist with this. I do hope the sisters work it out. NAH.", "She offered her veil, so she would have that sliver of her mom. I agree, it\u2019s awful and heartbreaking in several ways.", "I feel like if the younger sister is being this pushy to get the dress, she isn\u2019t going to want to give it back. Then op wouldn\u2019t have the dress, sentiment, and family because the younger sister turned them on her.", "OP, you can just leave it in the closet forever instead -_- YTA", "Gas lighting how? Ops nta tho", "\u201c\u2026this could be a way to see your mom\u2019s memory and work come alive again.\u201d This hit me hard. Good perspective.", "Such a thoughtful reply.", "No way. Her wedding, her day, her dress! She doesn't want the dress altered as it was literally made for her. She offered the veil. And obviously it doesn't mean that much to her sister(bride to be)because she has another sister to ask but she doesn't want that one... Why not? It was made by her mom too... If that's the whole reason", "It\u2019s not hard to understand at all.", "im guessing OP is not a native speaker of English.", "Sorry, Google messed up ;-;", "Can\u2019t the same be said to the sister", "Fair enough, it is all just heartbreaking! It's hard to tell from such a short account but it seems like there's still a lot of healing needed in their whole family, hopefully they get there together.", "It\u2019s something her late mother made for her. It\u2019s understandable that she wouldn\u2019t want to see it modified. People grieve in different ways and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. For one person the right choice would be sharing the dress, for another the right choice is to hold onto it. Neither choice is wrong inherently, it depends on the person.", "Goodness, I hope you don\u2019t have siblings because you clearly wouldn\u2019t care about them at all."]}
