Tell your Mum no. Again and again. Point out you are not a dick. Point out that you said you would not do it and they ignored you. This is on them. Nor are your sisters the same. Your Mum is the one who is in love. Not you. It is unreasonable to think someone you met so recently is the same as a person you grew up with. You don't feel the same towards them.

Ella was in a different situation and you felt no need to help so you didn't.\n\nElla's current heartbreak is *not your fault* and your parents are major AH for implying and saying that it is. And they are double AH for expecting you to treat your stepsister the same as your sister when you've made it clear you don't feel the same way. The only person in the post that you've mentioned with a responsibility to protect Ella is her dad (and maybe your mom). By their own logic *Ella's dad failed her the most because a parent's ultimate role is to protect their children*. You shouldn't have had to step in for either Ella or your sister.", "NTA. You can't force a bond with someone. Would it have been nice of you to do? Absolutely. Also, your mom is full of baloney. It's NOT your responsibility to screen potential dating partners.
