The concierge has been booking activities and restaurants for ages. \n\nThis was in February so the trip was about 11 months away, and in that time my wife got pregnant. \n\nThe problem is my wife loves all winter sports and activities but in her condition she cannot participate in 2/3 of what was organised. My sister said it\u2019s fine, the hotel has 2 floors of spa and wellness facilities and there\u2019s plenty to do outside of physical activities in the area, which some other family will be doing anyway and we can always ask the concierge for appropriate experiences. \n\nThis won\u2019t work as my wife doesn\u2019t like being left out and winter really is her favourite season, and we can\u2019t afford a trip like this ourselves. It\u2019s really upsetting her that she won\u2019t be part of the group to go mushing or skiing or fat biking and she\u2019d have to see photos or hear about it later. \n\nI\u2019ve asked my sister if we can\u2019t postpone the trip but she\u2019s said that\u2019s out of the question as niece goes to college in February and so much time and money went into this trip already. Maybe we could go somewhere warm where my wife won\u2019t feel as bad for not participating in water activities but my sister said this wasn\u2019t a decision for us to make, we\u2019re just guests. We\u2019ve just come to a standstill still where I called her selfish and inconsiderate and she said that\u2019s hypocritical since I want to change 8 people\u2019s plans due to my family planning. \n\nShe told our parents about our talk and they called and told my prepare my wife and I for being unable to attend or do many things in the upcoming years, \u201cparenting means putting your own wishes to the side.\u201d They told us to be glad for the trip we\u2019ll have even if we can\u2019t do everything as planned, we\u2019ll need to learn to be flexible soon anyway. \n\nBut I feel like that\u2019s beyond the point. This trip was organized to make everyone happy and now my wife will be excluded from most if it it just feels really unfair to her, especially when this can all be scheduled for next NY or something. AWTA?\n\nEdit: alright I got it, AITA. I\u2019ll just see what pregnancy friendly snow activities are available and ask people to limit talk about their skiing and mushing.\n\nEdit2: since people keep bringing this up, I will be staying with my wife during this trip, but it won\u2019t change most of the others going on to do activities that we all planned and talked about doing together.  Or that we\u2019d have to hear about what we missed out on later during dinner or something.", "created_utc": 1670893210, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkhmmx/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_modify_our_vacation/", "score": 1614, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's not anyones fault and frankly they have offered other activities and said concierge would do their best to find activities for her. The fact you think you can ruin or change someone elses vacation is beyond wild to me. I once had a serious surgery before a disney vacation one year. I didn't force my entire family to change their trip for me.

The concierge has been booking activities and restaurants for ages. \n\nThis was in February so the trip was about 11 months away, and in that time my wife got pregnant. \n\nThe problem is my wife loves all winter sports and activities but in her condition she cannot participate in 2/3 of what was organised. My sister said it\u2019s fine, the hotel has 2 floors of spa and wellness facilities and there\u2019s plenty to do outside of physical activities in the area, which some other family will be doing anyway and we can always ask the concierge for appropriate experiences. \n\nThis won\u2019t work as my wife doesn\u2019t like being left out and winter really is her favourite season, and we can\u2019t afford a trip like this ourselves. It\u2019s really upsetting her that she won\u2019t be part of the group to go mushing or skiing or fat biking and she\u2019d have to see photos or hear about it later. \n\nI\u2019ve asked my sister if we can\u2019t postpone the trip but she\u2019s said that\u2019s out of the question as niece goes to college in February and so much time and money went into this trip already. Maybe we could go somewhere warm where my wife won\u2019t feel as bad for not participating in water activities but my sister said this wasn\u2019t a decision for us to make, we\u2019re just guests. We\u2019ve just come to a standstill still where I called her selfish and inconsiderate and she said that\u2019s hypocritical since I want to change 8 people\u2019s plans due to my family planning. \n\nShe told our parents about our talk and they called and told my prepare my wife and I for being unable to attend or do many things in the upcoming years, \u201cparenting means putting your own wishes to the side.\u201d They told us to be glad for the trip we\u2019ll have even if we can\u2019t do everything as planned, we\u2019ll need to learn to be flexible soon anyway. \n\nBut I feel like that\u2019s beyond the point. This trip was organized to make everyone happy and now my wife will be excluded from most if it it just feels really unfair to her, especially when this can all be scheduled for next NY or something.

She ended up in hospital.   \nPeople like that are dangerous, bordering on malicious instead of incompetency.", "My uncle believes that because he\u2019s the father of my grandfather\u2019s only \u201ctrue\u201d grandson, no family reunion would be complete without him and his family. He was shocked when no one begged him to come for the next one. His son has a job now and he pays his own way to come to reunions.", "I\u2019m glad your cousin somehow managed to grow up to be reasonable with such a self-obsessed asshole father", "We\u2019re all happy about that! He\u2019s a little weird with money, but pays his own way and never asks to be subsidized.", "I have it!!!!! Your wife can get the trip postponed a year so she can get the new graduate to babysit so mom can go skiing! Perfect!  Betcha the new graduate and her generous parents will just love that idea!  After all, what else is a girl for in a family but to serve the pregnant lady who could have avoided pregnancy but chose not to.  The new graduate\u2019s folks are probably dying to switch their love and loyalty to you and your wife.  Have you asked them to buy you s house yet?", "YTA\n\nTalk about choosy beggars.  Not only is your wife throwing a tantrum over a something she is getting for free when the whole event isn't for her benefit, but you actually dared say those providing it for you are selfish?  It was NOT set up to make everyone happy.  It was set up to make your niece happy.  You and your wife are baggage that are being brought along out of kindness.  Yet you actually tried to hassle the others into bending to your wife being rotten and they aren't even allowed to talk about the things they enjoyed if it might possibly hurt her egotistical feelings?  That's insane.  -It's not your trip.  You were invited as a courtesy-  Honestly, if I were them, I would have uninvited both of you the instant you started getting pissy.\n\nYour parents are right.  You 100% need to get over yourselves before the baby arrives.  Your wife sounds deeply self centered and you are an enabler to her vanity.  Are you really sure you guys are ready to be parents?", "Wow, some people on Reddit are UNHINGED. You called your sister who is giving you a free trip to France selfish because you and your wife don\u2019t know how to use birth control. You are lucky she didn\u2019t rescind the trip offer.", "YTA, it won't work because your wife doesn't like being left out?!?\n\nIt's a free vacation to celebrate your niece! \n\nSeriously the absolute gall to make demands is appalling!", "YTA\nHow self-centered do you have to be to think that a celebration for someone else should cater to your wife\nIf your wife doesn't want to miss out on some parts of the trip maybe the two of you should just be uninvited", "You honestly think it is okay to change the plans of 8 people to make your 1 wife happy?

Other people were invited to join a trip planned \nAs a graduation present.  This trip was never designed to be a trip for you and your wife.  You are invited but it isn\u2019t your trip.  \n\nMissing out on the skiing and other stuff is a cost of being pregnant. The new graduate should not have to give up her present for your wife\u2019s wish to have the whole trip focus on her having a good time.\n\nYou and she can stay home.  You and she can go and be grateful for the free trip.  You and she can make it a romantic memory for the two of you snd enjoy the spa services and meals.  She wants to be included but the trip is a graduation present; it isn\u2019t her trip, make the most of it or stay home.", "Lol... this trip was planned around your niece. Not your wife. Get a grip on your entitlement. It's gross. Yta... so is your wife.", "YTA \n\nI'm trying hard not to laugh at the entitlement rolling off you and your wife from reading the post plus edits. \n\nThis trip has gone to your heads. Seriously, you're both guests not paying for anything. But are trying to adjust it like you paid and planned the whole thing. You're lucky your sister doesn't uninvite you both and make you sit through a slide show when they get back.", "This CANT be real. People have been getting pregnant since the dawn of time. You\u2019re not special. You\u2019re not unique. Your wife needs to get a grip. When I was pregnant I would have loved to lay about in the hotel going to the spa. ADAPT. OVERCOME. Get a damn grip.", "Oh, this is gold, thanks so much for the laughs your post gave me. This trip is to celebrate your sister daughter, not to celebrate you and your wife, you aren't paying for it, your wife doesn't like feeling left out, and your solution is 11 months of planning g get thrown aside to suit your wife's petulant behavior. Buckle up buttercup, there are so many thongs you and your wife will miss out on once your baby is here, and if I were you, I'd expect to not be invited along, all expenses paid, for quite some time after this", "Not only are YTA, after you acknowledge it you KEEP whining like a little kid because now you might miss the activities.  You have a great free vacation in France - surely you can find some fun way to pass the time - sleigh rides,  shopping, eating out, sightseeing, visiting museums.

Literally no one is making you go on this trip, go find other winter things to do with your wife", "YTA. Your boring self and your boring wife can go sit in a bubble somewhere instead of ruining your nieces graduation trip. The entitlement is so strong, get a grip.

It's for your niece and they were kind enough to include you. The audacity of you calling them selfish. Really?! You would have been uninvited right there if it were me.

And you sound like a very whiny twerp saying you and wife will have to listen to others talking about what fun they had skiing etc. I am appalled at your childish behavior. I fear for your children if this is how you intend on teaching them morals and values. Again, you are a HUGE AH.", "This! If OPs wife is going to sulk the entire trip because people are talking about their experiences, she should stay home. It's a free trip to a luxury destination.

But still stupid nonetheless.", "You would be surprised.\n\nYTA.", "Yeah OPs lack of self awareness is really quite astounding. I wonder if he will be aware of how much everyone else will hate him and his wife when he goes around asking them not to talk about their fun experiences on this trip. Honestly it just sounds like OP is desperately trying to appease his entitled wife so that he doesn't have to deal with her being cranky. I'm a little scared to think of the kind of human they will raise.", "I was just thinking that!! The fact that they are still invited to this trip (that sis did NOT have to invite them to in the first place) after this is really showing how kind and patient sister is.
