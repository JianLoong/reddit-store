The concierge has been booking activities and restaurants for ages. \n\nThis was in February so the trip was about 11 months away, and in that time my wife got pregnant. \n\nThe problem is my wife loves all winter sports and activities but in her condition she cannot participate in 2/3 of what was organised. My sister said it\u2019s fine, the hotel has 2 floors of spa and wellness facilities and there\u2019s plenty to do outside of physical activities in the area, which some other family will be doing anyway and we can always ask the concierge for appropriate experiences. \n\nThis won\u2019t work as my wife doesn\u2019t like being left out and winter really is her favourite season, and we can\u2019t afford a trip like this ourselves. It\u2019s really upsetting her that she won\u2019t be part of the group to go mushing or skiing or fat biking and she\u2019d have to see photos or hear about it later. \n\nI\u2019ve asked my sister if we can\u2019t postpone the trip but she\u2019s said that\u2019s out of the question as niece goes to college in February and so much time and money went into this trip already. Maybe we could go somewhere warm where my wife won\u2019t feel as bad for not participating in water activities but my sister said this wasn\u2019t a decision for us to make, we\u2019re just guests. We\u2019ve just come to a standstill still where I called her selfish and inconsiderate and she said that\u2019s hypocritical since I want to change 8 people\u2019s plans due to my family planning. \n\nShe told our parents about our talk and they called and told my prepare my wife and I for being unable to attend or do many things in the upcoming years, \u201cparenting means putting your own wishes to the side.\u201d They told us to be glad for the trip we\u2019ll have even if we can\u2019t do everything as planned, we\u2019ll need to learn to be flexible soon anyway. \n\nBut I feel like that\u2019s beyond the point. This trip was organized to make everyone happy and now my wife will be excluded from most if it it just feels really unfair to her, especially when this can all be scheduled for next NY or something. AWTA?\n\nEdit: alright I got it, AITA. I\u2019ll just see what pregnancy friendly snow activities are available and ask people to limit talk about their skiing and mushing.\n\nEdit2: since people keep bringing this up, I will be staying with my wife during this trip, but it won\u2019t change most of the others going on to do activities that we all planned and talked about doing together.  Or that we\u2019d have to hear about what we missed out on later during dinner or something.", "created_utc": 1670893210, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkhmmx/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_modify_our_vacation/", "score": 260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one made you two have a baby. No one should have their trip ruined because your two are expecting. If you wife is going to feel left out then too bad. That's not anyones fault and frankly they have offered other activities and said concierge would do their best to find activities for her. The fact you think you can ruin or change someone elses vacation is beyond wild to me. I once had a serious surgery before a disney vacation one year. I didn't force my entire family to change their trip for me.

The concierge has been booking activities and restaurants for ages. \n\nThis was in February so the trip was about 11 months away, and in that time my wife got pregnant. \n\nThe problem is my wife loves all winter sports and activities but in her condition she cannot participate in 2/3 of what was organised. My sister said it\u2019s fine, the hotel has 2 floors of spa and wellness facilities and there\u2019s plenty to do outside of physical activities in the area, which some other family will be doing anyway and we can always ask the concierge for appropriate experiences. \n\nThis won\u2019t work as my wife doesn\u2019t like being left out and winter really is her favourite season, and we can\u2019t afford a trip like this ourselves. It\u2019s really upsetting her that she won\u2019t be part of the group to go mushing or skiing or fat biking and she\u2019d have to see photos or hear about it later. \n\nI\u2019ve asked my sister if we can\u2019t postpone the trip but she\u2019s said that\u2019s out of the question as niece goes to college in February and so much time and money went into this trip already. Maybe we could go somewhere warm where my wife won\u2019t feel as bad for not participating in water activities but my sister said this wasn\u2019t a decision for us to make, we\u2019re just guests. We\u2019ve just come to a standstill still where I called her selfish and inconsiderate and she said that\u2019s hypocritical since I want to change 8 people\u2019s plans due to my family planning. \n\nShe told our parents about our talk and they called and told my prepare my wife and I for being unable to attend or do many things in the upcoming years, \u201cparenting means putting your own wishes to the side.\u201d They told us to be glad for the trip we\u2019ll have even if we can\u2019t do everything as planned, we\u2019ll need to learn to be flexible soon anyway. \n\nBut I feel like that\u2019s beyond the point. This trip was organized to make everyone happy and now my wife will be excluded from most if it it just feels really unfair to her, especially when this can all be scheduled for next NY or something.

Entitled much?", "He trip was set up to make everyone happy? No, it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s a celebration for your niece, so it\u2019s going to be what your niece wants. You and your wife\u2019s feelings about this are unimportant. Your niece, her parents and everyone else except you are not there to accommodate your pregnant wife.\n\nPregnancy since the beginning of time has curtailed women\u2019s activities, whether you\u2019re throwing up or exhausted or can\u2019t get comfortable enough to sleep.

At our last family reunion, my mom and her siblings paid for my uncle\u2019s family to come because they couldn\u2019t have otherwise. The entire time they complained about their hotel, the restaurants, and the activities, all of which they paid exactly $0 for.

Spas and such aren\u2019t even usually my thing, but a beautiful place to be, family to spend time with, and the chance of a really good massage plus some other pampering? Wonderful food? Other safe activities too? That sounds absolutely heavenly!

I *love* wine. For my sister\u2019s 21st birthday, my family scheduled a trip to one of the best wine regions in the world. Guess who was 2 months pregnant when we went to wine heaven? Me. Guess who couldn\u2019t drink wine in wine heaven? Me. There was nothing else to fucking do there either so I got to spend the trip watching my family get wasted on - in their words - \u201cthe most delicious wine ever.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m **still** saying you\u2019re the asshole here. \n\nSo yea, YTA.
