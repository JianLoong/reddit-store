It sounds like she is deeply ashamed and embarrassed and is taking it out on you.\n\nI wish you both the best of luck.", "NTA, if you couldn\u2019t lift her, you couldn\u2019t lift her, period and did what any smart person in your situation would- ask for help.", "NTA.  As I have gotten older, I have had to start using a walker because I'm a fall risk.  And I do get embarrassed when I fall and need help to get up.   So I get how your sister feels.\n\nThat being said, she has no right to take her anger out on you.  You could not help her on your own.  What did she expect?  That you would just leave her there?  Was she planning to just live in that one spot at the mall for the rest of her life.  Expecting people to bring her something from the food court.  Ridiculous of her to be mad at you.", "NTA\n\nYou probably shouldn't have added that bit about her losing weight (you're not **incorrect**, it's just not the thing to say to an overweight person).\n\nYou were right in getting help. She is unfortunately very heavy and was unable to help herself. My guess is that she was embarrassed and angry at herself and took it out on you.", "NTA it\u2019s either accept help from a stranger or she would still be lying there now. Maybe the comment about losing weight was a bit harsh considering how raw the embarrassment was but you\u2019re definitely not the asshole for getting her up the way you did.", "NTA: Your only other choice was to leave her there and call 911 for help...  and I suspect she would be even MORE embarrassed just sitting there waiting, and then have multiple rescue personal lifting her up.", "NTA. Would she have been less embarrassed to be left on the ground? Sometimes, if you take any action to make a bad situation less bad, you will be blamed for it still being bad.", "NTA if she can't even get herself up at 18 she needs to change something cuz my 79 year old grandma aint even got knees that bad.", "nta. lucy needs to take responsibility for her own well being. It\u2019s unfair for her to expect you to risk injury yourself by lifting her when I can only assume she\u2019s atleast double your weight. i\u2019m sure it was embarrassing but the alternative was to lay on the ground waiting for emergency services, which I imagine would be quite worse", "Yeah NTA. I know commenting on weight can be taboo to some but this is a more extreme case. Her expecting you to lift her up on your own is insane and quite frankly not your job which is how she made it sound.\n\nThe truth is hard but her life is at risk at that weight.", "NTA. \n\nShe's probably mad and/or embarrassed are her self, her weight, and her inability to do something as simple as get up off the floor and took it out on you. \n\nIt's not fair to you. You did not do anything wrong. You cannot lift 400lbs and eventually someone would have to help because she can't just lie on the floor. \n\nThis is either gonna be the wake up call for her or she's gonna get worse before she hopefully gets better", "NTA - truth hurts sometimes.", "NTA.   \nEmbarrassment is better than injury. You needed help. What was she going to do? Stay on the floor forever?", "NTA. Doesn't look like you had any other option. Maybe at home Lucy can practice ways to get up from the ground - like could she manage it if you were able to pull a chair over or something? It could be useful.", "NTA\n\nand \n\nNTA for telling her off.\n\nI guess if it happens again, she just lays on the floor until she looses enough weight?", "NTA. You can hurt yourself trying to help someone if they are too heavy or you are not trained to move people correctly. The only safe option for you would be to leave her on the floor or ask for  help. Which would mean even more people seeing her like that. \n\nFYI- it's not all that uncommon for rescue personnel to be called (non emergently) to help get very large people up off the floor in situations like that. No employees at the mall were likely trained in patient movement. Security guards aren't copt aren't managers aren't etc. They likely would have been prohibited from helping due to liablilty issues.  And if rescue personnel had been summoned, it would likely have been a crew of several people.  I had a neighbor who was about that size and would call 911 for help to get up not infrequently. Every time it was at least 6 men. (occasionally 5 men and a woman) Your cousin is lucky that guy was willing to help and that's all it took. She probably only needed a bit more than you could provide, but if help had been summoned it would have likely been several people.", "NTA. She of all people should understand that sometimes you just need a little help!", "NTA. She needs to get her priorities straight and lose weight. I get that she was embarrassed. She should use that to power a weight loss strategy. And yes, I\u2019m sure people will downvote this, but the reality is she is killing herself slowly and the reality also is that it is overeating and eating terrible foods to do it. Some people have predispositions to gaining and retaining weight. But you don\u2019t get to that level of obesity without going way, way overboard. \n\nI think approaching this with concern is crucial. Has she ever gotten into a treatment program to figure out a strategy for weight loss?", "NTA. Your statement was a bit harsh but under the circumstances I don\u2019t really blame you. And asking the stranger for help certainly wasn\u2019t assholeish at all. I do feel for her, I\u2019m sure she was feeling very ashamed and embarrassed, but she shouldn\u2019t have taken that out on you.", "NTA.  If she doesn't want strangers helping her stand, she should lose weight.", "NTA \n\nYou definitely shouldn\u2019t of mentioned her weight when she was already clearly embarrassed by it.", "YTA- But not for getting help. Lucy was embarrassed and that's why she reacted that way. You are the asshole for directly saying if she wanted to be picked up without help taht she needs to get down to a weight that it's manageable at. She was already embarrassed, that comment was just harsh and unnecessary.", "NTA next time let her call AAA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even dropping 20 pounds will do wonders for her knees.", "Lucy TA. Lifting fat people who can\u2019t do for themselves. (Either cause they legit can\u2019t or refuse to.)\n\nWill really mess up your back. CNA\u2019s, Techs and many other medical professionals can tell you this.

Sure, but I get why you said it and she was rude too.", "NTA either she accepts help when things like that happen OR you call for help (ie ambulance or police both of which may have to file a report) so I guess it\u2019s up to her. Either way you asking for help is again NTA but the way she treated you was.", "NTA how many of her friends can lift that weight?", "YTA asshole only for the losing weight comment. My mom has bad knees and when she has fallen getting her up is an ordeal, and I\u2019m rather strong and she weighs nothing approaching 440. \n\nBut no, N T A for getting help and not hurting yourself.", "NTA. Not in the slightest. I know it sounds harsh, anc it probably is, but if she can't get up on her own because she is so heavy then perhaps she needs to lose weight. Her knee issues could also be related to he weight honestly, though there could be a lot of unrelated issues.\n\nAnd honestly, your a better person than I am. If I were in your shoes and she fell again I wouldn't do anything. She can figure that out on her own. If she doesn't want help from a stranger, that's her problem.", "Lucy needs to not blame the LW for her insbility to get up.\n\nLW was not wrong.\n\nSigned  \nFat Girl.", "Well, yes, Lucy was embarrassed, and the embarrassment led to her lashing out. However, just because it\u2019s logical doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right. Lucy was very wrong to lash out at OP like that. OP didn\u2019t say anything unduly mean, and it certainly wasn\u2019t \u201cunnecessary.\u201d Lucy offered some deeply invalid criticism, and OP had every right to explain/justify herself.", "As someone who has struggled with their own weight and is currently working on it. This is the kind of stuff that lets people know where they stand in the world. If she wants to get upon her own she needs to work on her physique until she can."]}
