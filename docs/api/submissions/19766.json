Tell them you're going to Brazil or Turkey or the Artic Circle. Eventually they'll figure it out.", "NTA. Enjoy your trip. One\u2019s vacation should not always have to be a family one, especially when kids are dumped on you to babysit because of \u201cso and so needs a break\u201d, BS.  Don\u2019t allow idiot family gaslight you. They are the AH for doing so. You\u2019re going to love Japan.", "Turn your phone off asap.  NTAH.  Before I got married I loved going on vacations alone.  Now I take my two little girls with me so they can see the world even if they won't remember a lot of it.  It's your vacation, go when and wherever you want to alone or with the whole fam...", "How does a giant family mobilize like this for everyone to be able to take the same times off to travel when anyone has planned a trip ?? No work, obligations, school, prior commitments ? You\u2019re def NTA but I don\u2019t understand how this is possible", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of fucked up toxic codependent shit is this?", "NTA temporarily blocks for a sense of peace.", "NTA- next time tell them you\u2019re going to a different country than where you\u2019re really going. They can have their family trip and you can enjoy your solo trip! \n\u201cOhhh did I say I was going to London? I meant London, Ontario in Canada! Sorry for the confusion!\u201d", "NTA. It may feel bad in the moment, but you should absolutely be proud of yourself for setting a boundary with your family.", "You are definitely NTA.  What an entitled family just turning everything into a family holiday (I could not think of anything worse.  They are disrespectful of your decision (you had no need to even think if including them).  As for blowing up your phone and creating drama - how childish they are.  This is us proof for never holiday in with them ever again.", "Nope. NTA. Enjoy Japan! I hope to visit someday!", "Wtf your family is weird", "Either this is made up or you just want to share how crazy your family is smh. NTA.", "NTA. Your family need to plan their own trips without leveraging off yours. The entitlement to berate you for having a solo holiday!!", "Nta.  Everyone is entitled to alone time.", "NTA. My family is somewhat similar, but they at least ask. Sometimes they'll go to the same place as me, but we'll be completely separate (aka I do my things, they do theirs, and if we feel like it, maybe we meet up for meals).\n\nAlso the babysitting thing is ridiculous lol. I'm in a a similar position, but my siblings know I don't like kids and therefore don't expect me to entertain them beyond just normal life.\n\nP.S. have fun in Japan :) I live here so if you want any food recs feel free to hmu", "NTA\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to do a vacation on your own. \n\nPersonally I think it weird that the family constantly tries/turns it into a family event. That would drive me bonkers. \n\nNo you are not selfish for wanting a solo trip autistic or not.", "NTA\n\nYour family sounds insane.", "NTA. And they just can't figure out why you don't want to travel with them?", "They can't handle boundaries...like none of them?", "Oh God, absolutely not! You're an adult and can do whatever you want. Sounds like they're also pissed because they have to watch their own kids. I must've been absent from school the day we were taught that we weren't allowed to go on vacations without family tagging along. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "NTA Its really creepy that you cant do things on your own. I guess that is also why you didn't even invite one friend for safety kind of thing. Seems like you need some space and fresh air. I feel like the capsule was so more so they couldn't come in the first place because there would be cheap accommodation that weren't the pods. I hope you have fun. I've always wanted to go.", "NTA - and good for you for standing up for yourself and putting a stop to this nonsense. Well done. If I were you, I would never tolerate the whole \u201cwe can all go on vacation together and I get stuck being the built in babysitter\u201d ever again. Mute your phone and have a wonderful trip!", "NTA. It\u2019s your vacation that you want to do solo. They can be upset but it\u2019s your choice to not invite them to come along. They\u2019re just gonna have to deal with it.", "Wow I can barely even convince my parents to go on a holiday, forget about convincing my entire extended family; I beg my cousins/aunts and uncles all the time but nothing has ever materialised, everyone is always like someday. I can barely coordinate a trip with one friend, group trips are practically impossible \n\nI can\u2019t imagine having the entire extended family follow me on every trip I book! How is that even logistically possible even if they have the money, what about school for the kids and time off from work? \n\nNTA obviously", "Every vacation from now on is in the Amazon. To visit man sized snakes. NTA.", "NTA.  Turn off the phone for awhile.", "You come from a family of selfish freaks", "NTA.  Your family seems rather entitled to your time, plus they get a free babysitter.  This trip is about you and your desires, it has nothing to do with them.  You are an adult, and you get to do what you want, and I would include not babysitting anymore.  Go have your solo trip, it's your life and your money.  I hope you have a wonderful time.", "NTA\n\nThey want to go to Japan and don\u2019t have a babysitter.", "NTA - you are an adult and you can go on a vacation by yourself if you so want. They are the AH by trying to make you feel guilty.\n\nSuggestion - tell the family they CAN go on a vacation to Japan with you. Pick a different date and tell them since it is going to be more expensive they will have to pay for it.  AND go on the vacation by yourself and do not tell them. So you get two vacations to Japan.\n\nSide note - I go on vacations and don't tell them family before and sometimes after. Don't want to deal with a different kind of BS.", "NTA\n\nSOOOOO NTA\n\nWhat the actual-", "NTA, enjoy your shiny new spine, OP \ud83e\udd70", "NTA it is plain rude to invite themselves on your trip and then expect you to babysit.\n\nKeep booking your own trips and keep it secreet", "NTA.  This is ridiculous and needs to stop.", "NTA\nNone of this is your fault", "you are not TA. Everyone deserves to have a breather and alone time.", "NTA\n\nLow contact time, have a wonderful child-free holiday.", "Why did you answer at all? Do they pay your bills?\nNTA for booking the female only hotel.\nTotal AH for explaining yourself.\nNo, can\u2019t make it. I already made plans.\n\nFamily: Who, what, where, why?\nYou: silence. Or: If I talk too much, it won\u2019t be what I envisioned. Stay tuned!", "lol these people sound so strange. I\u2019m over here trying to avoid big family vacations because they\u2019re a nightmare and they\u2019re putting themselves in financial ruin to all bunk together every summer. Can I ask what culture you\u2019re from?", "Oooh. Sounds like a tiny country I know in the middle of the Pacific.", "Start lying about where you're going.  I've heard North Korea is lovely.", "Have you tried refusing to provide a reason? Like, stand your ground, don't say anything. They're not entitled to any of that information. \"Sorry, I won't tell you, you don't respect my boundaries\".", "I have taken several solo trips and had a great time. Usually road trips. Travelling solo means no plan, no deadline, no compromising, just wake up each day and do whatever YOU want to do. It's great.     \nEnjoy your trip and have a great time.", "The older they get the more they can see that their parents are both fobbing them off on you against your will and that this is their future.", "Yes, there's a bot.", "OP needs to let them be on an information diet", "First generation gets rich through a mix of good luck and hard work.\n\nSecond generation understands that.\n\nThird generation thinks they're rich because it's their destiny, and eventually goes broke.", "I thought it was just the first one that counted?", "Nah, 70% of families lose their wealth in the second generation too. Spoiled brats happen fast. \n\nBut true, they're 20% more likely to understand what made the wealth happen.", "Or a great crime."]}
