Someone mentions they're going on vacation? They all suggest to make it a family trip/reunion. And I have a large family with a lot of younger cousins/nieces and nephews, which can get really overwhelming because I'm autistic. (something they don't get and call me rude for whenever I leave early at events)\n\nI booked plane tickets to Japan for this upcoming July a while ago, since I've always wanted to visit. My hotel is a women's-only capsule hotel, something I chose deliberately because it's a. cheaper and b. I feel much safer in women's only accommodation, especially since I'm travelling alone to a country I've never been to.\n\nI was invited to my niece's birthday recently, and stated that I wouldn't be able to attend. I initially tried not to disclose the reason as I knew they'd try and make it a family trip (I do this whenever I go on holiday and don't tell them until I'm already gone). However, I got pressured for the reason a lot and eventually had to say that I'd be on holiday then in Japan. Immediately, my aunt was like \"oh, what hotel are you staying at? We'll book rooms too and make it a big family summer holiday!!\". At this point, I realised that they probably wouldn't be able to book the same capsule hotel I was in as the rooms are single person and women-only. So I went ahead and told them anyway.\n\nWell, one of my family members must've looked it up and told the rest of them this, because I got a barrage of texts saying how dare I not make my vacation inclusive of them and that I was being incredibly selfish. I snapped back in our groupchat and said that I was sick of them inviting themselves on every single holiday, that just because we're family we don't need to spend all our time off together, and that I would most certainly NOT be welcoming of them trying to do anything with me on MY solo vacation to a country I've been wanting to visit for many years, that I have paid for myself. Not to mention, on previous family trips, I've been stuck babysitting my younger family because I'm the youngest adult.\n\nLong story short, everyone is blowing up my phone now for what I said.

Go to Japan and have the time of your life. I went on a family vaca last year and it was exhausting and when I returned, I felt like I needed another vacation.
