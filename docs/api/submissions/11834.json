{"id": 11834, "submission_id": "11maj3i", "title": "AITA for asking my brother to move out?", "selftext": "My adult brother (33) has been living with me and my children for the last 6 years.  I don't charge him much to live here, just enough to cover some utilities and such. The last couple of years he has traveled for work, so at times he is gone for weeks at a time and times he is home for weeks at a time.  He has what I would classify as undiagnosed mental health issues.  Without going into a long detailed list, he lashes out at family and says incredibly rude/mean things when he is in his \u201cepisodes\u201d. We all know he has issues and dont take it to heart because of that but it really affects our family from time to time. There have been times where I have left my house for the night with the kids because of him and I getting into fights over him being rude/disrespectful.  The last time we got into an argument, I told him it would be the last time, no more warnings and he would be asked to leave, this was in October.  This weekend he came home from being out of town for a month and picked a fight with me through text message while we both were in the house. I approached him in his room immediately and he continued to say some disrespectful things again and then tried to shut a door on me that I was standing in the door way.  I lost my cool and told him when he comes home from his next trip he needs to pack and leave. I ended up taking the kids that night to my boyfriends house so I wouldn't have to be there and see him anymore. He was leaving the next morning for work. \n\nAITA for asking him to actively plan/move when he gets back?  My mother is incredible furious at me saying that I am not being reasonable and that he needs 3-6 months to find a place to live.  I don't think I am being unreasonable given that he has had warnings but now somehow I am the bad guy. I\u2019ve excused his behavior for years but i\u2019ve had enough.", "created_utc": 1678315035, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11maj3i/aita_for_asking_my_brother_to_move_out/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like she doesn\u2019t want him in her house either.", "NTA. He\u2019s had years to figure shit out and hasn\u2019t.", "NTA. Did you ask, I might suggest that YTA for exposing your kids to this for the last several years. He needs to leave, and mom can take him in if she\u2019s so concerned.", "NTA\n\nHis \u201cmental health issues\u201d are his problem. When they become your problem you are in control.", "So your adult brother, who us living with you basically rent free, is Rude and cruel to the point were you sometimes have to take your children out of your own house. He tried to slam a door on you while you were stood in the doorway and generally behaves in a way that negatively affects your family after you've put him up for six years. \nThis being, as you specified, not the whole, detailed list- implying that there is more. \n\nAnd now you've kicked him out. \n\nNo, darling, you are absolutely NTA.", "NTA to start since your brother is starting arguments in front of your kids that's bad already, and then he's stressing you out, and then there is the parental stress.\nThis can only escalate so it's best to stop it before it does", "If your mother is so concerned about him she can let him move in with her.\n\nYou gave him fair warning.", "NTA\n\nFor six years, you've been teaching your kids that being yelled at and emotionally abused is normal. If you have daugthers, they'll accept that kind of behavior from men. If you have sons, they'll think they get to lash out when they're frustrated. Time to change that.\n\nAnd if the problem is he doesn't have time to find a place, find it for him.  You can faciltate him signing a lease and you can even have his stuff moved. Personally, I wouldn't allow him back in my home.", "NTA. Move him in with your mother, problem solved.", " *I have left my house for the night with the kids because of him* \n\nThat's seriously messed up, that **his behavior is so bad you have to leave your home**.  \n\nNTA.  You did this correctly.  **You set the rule, told him the consequence** of breaking it.  **He broke it.  You told him the consequence** of his bad behavior is exactly what you said it would be.  This isn't your fault.  He did the bad behavior, and broke your rule.  **He has the results of that to handle now.  That's not your fault** either.  It's what adults do: make choices, and take the consequences that follow.  \n\nDon't know the legal rules where you live for someone living in your house as a guest for that long.  You might need to give him a written notice that he needs to be out on Date.  If you do, find out and do it.  \"Just a reminder that your date to be out of my house is Date.\"   **You might be able to pack up his stuff while he's gone and put it in storage for him so you can change all your locks before he comes back** and not have to deal with him again.  **Because you have had to leave your home, with your children, due to his behaviors, it's possible that you can do this, to protect yourself** and your children from even more of his bad behaviors.  I hope you can, because then you can put up No Trespassing signs and keep him away.\n\n**This has nothing to do with your mother.**  It's your business, not hers.  **It's okay to tell her that you \"aren't discussing this with her.\"**  It's okay to say to her \"Mom, I'm not going to be talking to you for the next Week/Weeks/Month, because you aren't respecting my decision to protect my family.\" \n\n**Will he have to find a place?  Yes**.  Could he have already been working on this, knowing he was likely to behave badly again?  Yes, **he could have been looking since October**, which is what, five months ago?   If he has to rent a weekly motel room for a while until he finds a place, that isn't your problem, it's his.  He had time to plan, and again, it was his choice not to plan ahead and find a place.  So if he has to couch surf, or pay for a hotel, or **whatever he does, that's on him, not you.**  You aren't responsible for solving his issues.  He is.  You have given him enough, for years.\n\n**I'd also plan for what to do if he doesn't do anything to move out.**  If you tell him Date to be moved out, and he hasn't packed up by the day before, have a plan to have a bunch of your friends come over and \"help\" him pack up.  Have boxes, tape, markers, and food for them.  Maybe have someone take your kids elsewhere for safety.  If you know someone with a truck, they can load it with his stuff, and if he doesn't have a place to go, he can go rent a storage unit or ask your mother for garage space.  Don't make the mistake I did getting someone out and give them garage space.  That's another mess to have to handle.\n\nAt this point, the priority isn't what your mother thinks.  It's protecting your home, and your children, from someone that behaves badly enough that you have to leave.", "NTA should have been kicked out 5 years and 6 months ago. You shouldn't be fleeing YOUR house because of HIS problems.", "Your mother can take him in then", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not his fault that he has mental health issues, but it is his fault that he\u2019s not acknowledging that they directly affect his family (your kids included) and that he doesn\u2019t seek therapy. As soon as his issues put you and your kids\u2019 well-being in jeopardy, then it\u2019s fully within your right to intervene.\n\nUltimately, if he keeps going down this path, everyone in your family will resent him, your kids will remember him as their \u201ccrazy unhinged uncle\u201d\n\nMy stepfather is like this. He\u2019s an alcoholic and has many mental issues that he never took care of. Treated his family (including me) like crap. Nearly everyone in my family on my moms side hat him at worst and barely tolerate him at best. This is what unchecked mental issues do to people", "NTA he\u2019s a grown man! That\u2019s plenty of time to figure out a new living arrangement. He was warned and knew what would happen!", "NTA! Mental issues are not meant to be used to mooch off family and he's been doing it long enough. Mental issues may explain certain behaviours, but they certainly do not excuse continued blatant disrespect and rudeness. He has gotten way to used to not having to fully take himself in charge.\n\nFor your and your family's sanity he needs to move out. He seems to already have a job, that's a good thing. Now he needs to haul himself into proper therapy for diagnosis, medication, and all the rest. \n\nIf your mom is that upset you are kicking him out, then why doesn't she take him in while he is looking for an apartment? Do not give hime any kind of extended deadline, he will most likely take advantage of it. A week or two would be quite sufficient.", "NTA. He doesn't need 3 to 6 months to fine a new place to live. He can throw his stuff in storage and find a new apartment to rent starting in April. He has money to do so since he basically pays you nothing. If your mom is so concerned she should put her time into helping him instead of making you look like the bad guy in all this.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely not! When your home becomes a place you have to leave because a freeloading lodger is being an asshole then it\u2019s time to kick said lodger out. It doesn\u2019t matter who they are, it\u2019s YOUR home so what you say goes. \n\nYour brother is the a-hole for his behaviour in your home. Your mother is the a-hole for expecting you to just roll over because of his situation. She\u2019s his mother, she can put him up.", "NTA Give him time and notice? I think you did that the last time he went into anger mode. It's time he leaves.", "NTA", "NTA. You gave him a more than fair warning.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Be sure and get some legal advice before putting him out.  You may need to actually go the eviction route.
