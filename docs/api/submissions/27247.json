We planned on making it our custom dream home. We both work really hard to get what we have, work even harder every weekend with demo & renovations. \n\nWell, about 5 months into it, her sister had some sort of argument with her mom about having to pick up some slack & without our consent, she just picked a room & moved her things into our home. At the time, the property was vacant since my partner & I had our apartment in Dallas & travel every weekend to renovate. \nAfter a while, my home didn\u2019t even feel like ours anymore. It was filled with her things & boxes everywhere. We had a discussion about cleanliness since we were working really hard to renovate it. We thought that would be it, common courtesy. \n\nFF, i finally moved in a couple months ago but my partner was called to Louisiana for work for awhile. I WFH & can\u2019t help but notice her sisters routine, or lack of. She works for uber & tells my partner she works almost every other night & how she\u2019s always busy. \nBut since I\u2019ve been here, she\u2019s gone to work about 5-7 times this past 2 months, she\u2019s not cleaning up after herself even after we\u2019ve kindly asked. I went into the kitchen for some water the other night & found a whole stick of butter melted dripping from my new spice rack, down to the counters & into the floors. She went out with her friends that night to a party so I had to clean it. I sent her a photo & reminded her to clean up after herself.  She told me she was high & forgot to clean. \nI noticed she started eating my groceries before I could even get a chance to sometimes, & doesn\u2019t provide or contribute to anything. She sees me cleaning the living room or hallways & she just gets up from her bed to close her bedroom door so she can keep watching things on her phone which is being paid by her mom & using my wifi.\nAt first I was trying to be patient as I hoped it was just temporary & I love my partner & I would do anything for her. But It\u2019s been a year now that she\u2019s been living in our home & doesn\u2019t seem to understand what she is doing/not doing is wrong. \nWhen we asked her to get a job or help around the house at least, she said she feels cornered & being pressured & was being bullied then started crying & telling my partner she will live in her jeep to make me feel better.\n\nI feel like the story flipped on me as I\u2019m the bad person. I never kicked her out, but I asked her to help clean or something and to start getting motivated/ gain independence. We\u2019re the same age (29).

IDK anything about landlord/tenant law in your state but you may have to start formal eviction proceedings if, for example, she gets mail at your address.

If your partner loves and cares and respects you, she would never let it happen this way. Each person should handle their own family member and your partner is ok with this, then she\u2019s the AH, bigger than her sister. Why? Because the sister aims to use you, who she could care less.

My partner was first okay with her sister moving in, because she needed a place to stay after her argument- until we started seeing more about this and me personally living with her. I want to say she has my back, but when I bring up another episode she just kinda stays quiet. I mean I get it. I would feel torn and awkward if the roles were reversed.
