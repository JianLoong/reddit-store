Why is she opposed? Because she\u2019s uncomfortable with the age gap in our relationship. My fianc\u00e9 and I met five years through mutual friends and never before that. We were friends for a two years before I asked him out and now we\u2019re planning on getting married in the summer. \n\nWhen we announce our engagement to my family about four months ago, Mary  screeched in horror. She started screaming about how because he\u2019s \u201cso much older it\u2019s suspicious he wants to marry me\u201d and she kept saying \u201chow old were you when he was 18? Huh? Huh? 16!\u201d We were all taken aback and were very confused by her outburst. I reminded her that Brian and I didn\u2019t meet until I was 23 yo. and we were both working professionals. She just kept repeating the fact that when he was 18, I was sixteen. \n\nMy older sister (30 F) pointed out that her husband (31 M) is almost 2 years older than her. And my stepdad (45 M) pointed out our mom (50 F) is five years older and a difference of a few years in a relationship is normal in adult relationships. This only further upset Mary and she started repeatedly pointing out how old my older sister and her dad (my step dad) were when they\u2019re respective partners were 18 years old. She even told my mother that when \u201cshe (Mom) was in kindergarten, she would have dated a baby.\u201d\n\nFast forward, my mom and stepdad have talked with Mary a few times about the differences between young teenagers dating older people and adults dating people a few years older. My mom told my older sister and I that it\u2019s not about Brian or anyone specifically, but she\u2019s really struggling to understand the difference between a 28 yo dating a 30 yo and a 15 year old dating an 18 yo or older. And now she violently against my, our sister\u2019s, and our parents\u2019 relationships because we\u2019re with partners of different ages. And apparently, Mary is planning on objecting and causing a scene at the wedding since \u201cno one else understands how wrong this is, she\u2019ll make us\u201d. \n\nThis is where I might be the AH. She\u2019s been talking about doing this for months until I finally snapped and told her that since she can\u2019t listen to reason and be respectful, she\u2019s uninvited to the wedding. My mom thinks it\u2019s going too far by uninviting Mary from the wedding. Mary is just young and learning and that\u2019s no reason to uninvite her from my wedding. I, however, don\u2019t want my wedding ruined by a chronically online teen. And because I know some people will ask, Mary doesn\u2019t have any diagnosed disabilities and nothing to our knowledge that would cause her to struggle so much with social rules. This is the first time she\u2019s done anything like this. So, AITA?\n\nEdit: Our parents are currently working with her pediatrician to get her to a therapist. We\u2019re sure there\u2019s a deeper issue going on. They\u2019ve  hope she\u2019d come around to understand but it hasn\u2019t happened yet, which is why they didn\u2019t get her into therapy sooner.", "created_utc": 1672606660, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100t899/aita_for_uninviting_my_sister_from_my_wedding/", "score": 340, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sound crazy that she\u2019s so violently against such a tiny age gap\u2026when you said she was so opposed I had to go back and double check your ages. She clearly has an issue here but your wedding is not the place for her to make a stand so I think your well allowed to uninvite her. Maybe allow her at the reception but no way should she be allowed at your ceremony", "NTA\n\nAllowing a 14-year-old child to ruin such an important moment in your life would be a bad thing. She will outgrow her messed-up opinion. She can change. The past cannot. You\u2019ll never be able to redo your memories.", "NTA - at first I thought your sister is jealous of your relationship with your husband or maybe even has a crush on him? Or maybe she was interested in a guy 2 years older than her and he told her she\u2019s too young so now she\u2019s fixated on that? It would be a shame if you had to invite her from the wedding but I wouldn\u2019t blame you, have your parents considered taking her to a therapist? Maybe she\u2019d have an easier time talking this through with someone outside the family?", "NTA  \n\n\nIf your younger sister can not understand the basic relationship and still intends to cause trouble on your important day, then dropping her is not a problem.  \n\n\nWedding day is yours and your fiancee day not the day where the feeling of the family are taken care of.  \n\n\nI am pretty sure for every bride no wedding day is without any drama, so Identifying a potential drama and stopping it before it occurs will not be a big issue, unless you want to inform all the guest regarding this and tell them to ignore if any objection is raised?", "Nta. She obviously can\u2019t control herself and the wedding is about you and your partner, not her.", "NTA. Your sister is old enough to understand the age difference and is purposely being disruptive knowing how it upsets all of you. Teenage drama at its finest. \n\nYou have a right to a happy wedding day, without dealing with a teenager hell bent on making trouble. Sometimes you need family boundaries and this is one time it's perfecyly fine to take a stand.", "NTA wow I couldn't even believe what I was reading. I've had more mature thoughts on relationships come from my ten year old students. \n\nI would be giving the same ultimatum. Either keep quiet or don't come. \n\n\nUnless there's an underlying reason other than age that she knows about as to why you shouldn't be married...\n\n2 years.. my bf is 4 years older than me. My sister's husband is 10 years older. Man I just can't. If I heard that from a student in the schools I'd be in shock. Cause whoa.", "Nta - this would be a sign of other problems, perhaps she or someone close to her has been groomed? I'm afraid excluding her no matter she says going forwards is the only sensible move.", "NTA, but your sister definitely has something going on that needs to be looked into if she is so hung up on this. If she isn\u2019t already in therapy I\u2019d suggest it to your parents as maybe there is something going on that she isn\u2019t telling your family that this is a round about way of hinting at\u2026\nBut worst case, you could always have her at the reception but not the ceremony if she won\u2019t let the urge to object go if you want her there but want to avoid the disruption.

I wouldn't want someone who I knew would object at my wedding, either.\n\nTo be sure, a 2-year age gap could be a problem for a 14-year-old such as your sister. I can see why someone would find it problematic for a 9th grader to date a 7th grader, for example. However, it should be fairly obvious that such an age difference is not a concern at age 28 or 30.\n\nHow long is the wedding from now? If it's in awhile (e.g., next summer) and your sister gets her act together, you should consider including her since she is family and still a child. But if she continues to be like this shortly before the wedding, your option to not invite her is sensible.", "NTA.  I had to go back several times to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding.  You're marrying someone who's two years older than you?  That's hardly a stretch.  Mary seems to have some sort of hang-up on this and needs a serious talking-to or you need a deep-dive into why she's acting like this.  In any event, since she's already stated she's going to cause a fuss at the wedding you're okay to uninvite her.", "Edited cause I wasn't reading right. \n\nNTA The child needs to learn that if she intends to ruin an event the host has the right to not allow her to be there.", "NTA, she\u2019s being ridiculous", "NTA \n\nBut if this post is true then something has happened to Mary! \n\nSome older boy has done something to make her feel uncomfortable! Your Mum really needs to get to the bottom of this", "NTA\n\nLmao what age difference??? You\u2019re only 2 years younger", "Nta there\u2019s a lot of weird purity culture in teens these days where they think any age gap is a sign of creepy grooming (among other weird, oddly puritanical nonsensical things). It\u2019s a huge push that ultimately goes back to radfems and terfs. \n\nCheck out what she\u2019s been looking at online and I bet she\u2019s got an echo chamber of other teenagers repeating this kind of nonsense to each other and encouraging each other to make the people irl obey their flawed concepts. Dollars to donuts that\u2019s where this whole thing started.", "NTA! I wonder if your sister was approached online by someone older. Regardless, being a guest is a priveledge, and she's already indicated she'll abuse it. Your parents should get her into therapy to find out why she feels so strongly, but until she apologizes, she can't go. Good luck and have a lovely wedding!", "no you are not the asshole", "Wowzers. NTA", "NTA in some state,not sure if in All states, if someone objects for any reason the wedding can\u2019t go on.", "NTA, but for the sake of extreme diligence: has your sister demonstrated discomfort with your fiance before, and has she spent any time alone with him? I'm not accusing him of anything at all, but an extreme reaction like that *could* be the result of him having said/done something to her that made her uncomfortable: she could be afraid to admit what happened but since he's older than *you* too, she can still bring up the problem in an oblique way, and then act as though she feels the same way about *all* relationships in order to deflect any suspicion that her extreme reaction is from personal experience.  Again, no accusations, there is no reason to think this is what happened, it's just an extreme scenario worth ruling out.  Because even if there's a 1/1000 chance it's true, you're going to want to know before you get married.  \n\nI do think banning your sister from your wedding is an extreme reaction that you may regret in the long term, and that could cause a rift in your relationship that might never heal.  Sure, it's her fault, but she's a kid and less capable of seeing the potential long-term consequences of her behavior.  So it is ultimately your responsibility (and her parents') to resolve the situation.  Surely her parents can give her an \"if you cause a disruption, there will be *x* consequence/punishment\" warning.  Ruining a family wedding is a pretty major offense and could merit a pretty major consequence, major enough to deter her from attempting it.  \n\nIt may also be worth asking what she hopes to *accomplish*, and ask her to picture the scenario playing out.  Does she expect the wedding guests to be persuaded by her outburst, and to join her in objecting to the wedding: can she honestly imagine that happening, especially considering no one has agreed with her so far?  Can she imagine that, instead, the wedding guests will look at her in shock and confusion, and spend the rest of the night whispering about what must be wrong with her?  She's more likely to suffer extreme social embarrassment than to start a revolution.   \n\nRegardless of whether she is invited to the wedding, someone she trusts should speak to her calmly to rule out that she has been abused/groomed herself, by anyone or God forbid by your guy.", "NAH and mary is.... yikes. Hope with her being so chronically online she'll see this post and see how absolutely ridiculous she is and take a step back.", "NTA don't let her ruin your wedding day. She already said she would.... believe her.", "NTA\n\nShe definitely needs help.\n\nHere\u2019s something to keep in mind.  If you\u2019re Catholic and they get to the objection part of the ceremony and she objects? The priest will stop the ceremony and you probably will not be able to get married that day. I don\u2019t know how it is in other faiths, or even if that\u2019s part of a non-Christian ceremony. I would talk to your officiant now and let them know your concerns and what\u2019s going on to see what can be done or how it would be handled.", "NTA, the vicar at my brother and sil\u2019s wedding explain that it might be funny to object but if anyone did then they would have to stop the wedding and wouldn\u2019t be able to get married that day so please not to do it!! Wether or not that might be true for you as well doesn\u2019t matter, its not funny or even a good enough reason to do it!!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMAke sure to keep her away from the wedding. Keep some of your friends ready to keep your parents out if they bring her, or her if she tries to crash the wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is a disturbed kid, but you shouldn't let her mental problems ruin your wedding.", "This has got to be fake I can\u2019t believe that any 14 year old without any diagnosed condition would act like this.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Some of it's going to be people who love to complain and weaponize language around abuse against people they have petty squabbles with, like all internet drama, but there wouldn't be a niche or a label like that to exploit if there weren't *actual* predators out there to make the accusations sound damning and credible.\n\nI'm not saying this to knock anybody, just that I faced weirdo behavior towards me as a kid when the internet had far less reach into kids' everyday lives and mental conditioning, and when I was an extremely online young adult, I did see peers and former friends take their newfound seniority and start using it to manipulate and exploit or scam kids in turn. It's out here, same as it's out here in real life, and it's insidious.
