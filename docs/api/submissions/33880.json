If you continue to stay, you deserve what you get.", "Wait.....so you care that he eats a deer that he hunts himself because you like animals.... but you have no problem consuming beef from cattle that is raised and slaughtered for the purpose of food. You can find all sorts of horror stories on how those animals are treated. What about chicken? What about pork?!\n\nIs it because he hunts for sport? There are hunt8ng seasons to control the deer population because otherwise they breed too fast and can harm the ecosystem. \n\nIs it just because it's deer and you won't eat deer specifically?", "YTA. \n\nIf he's a good hunter, which I suspect he is, he is killing that deer far more humanely than any slaughterhouse killed a cow after it's had a significantly better life than a farm raised cow, so you can try to stand on some sort of moral high ground, but it does not wash.

I don't personally hunt, but I know people who do and I always tell them If you hunt to put food on the table that is fine, if you hunt for sport, it is not OK and you are not my friend.

Is there a solution here where he is not the bad guy?\n\nI get that it was Christmas dinner. But its not just your Christmas. Its his too. Is it so wrong of him to want to eat what he loves during Christmas? \n\nI am not saying you are the AH here.

Saying you\u2019ve never said anything negative about his hunting but you also won\u2019t eat or cook the meat is misleading. You don\u2019t support him in his hobby.

You say you won't eat the meat he hunts because you're an animal lover,  yet you're fine eating beef and other animals that other people have killed, that's pretty hypocritical of you. You can't say it's because you're an animal lover when you eat animals. You're lying to your husband and being unnecessarily difficult. If you don't like deer meat then say that,  but don't lie to him or us about why you won't eat the meat he hunts.", "So you're an animal lover who will eat beef and other animals that are factory raised and sent to slaughter, but you won't eat an animal if it's killed by one individual hunter?

What he's putting on the table is better for you and more humane than the slab of raised, farmed beef you're trying to get him to make you. At least his deer 1) have a chance to survive and 2) get to run free before meeting their demise.

Just because it\u2019s hunted?\n\nUpdate: per your comment, OP, you may not care much for the taste, but the real reason you don\u2019t eat venison is because it was hunted.

He is acting by a 10 yo child.  \n\nAre you sure he is hunting every time he tells you he is hunting? \n\nI give it another 8 months before attorneys are hired and paperwork filed.  These are fundamental core belief differences which will not be resolved.", "ESH.\n\nEdited a few things after rereading.\n\nYou should try things more than once. If this is about the taste like you're leaning into more than the not liking hunting aspect. There are ways to get rid of or minimize the gamey-ness. Surprisingly, I think squirrel tastes delicious but if anyone had cooked it other than my pappy, idk how it would have turned out.\n\nI liked pork years ago and slowly like it less and less as I age, now I barely even touch bacon and I used to be able to eat a pound of that myself.\n\nLook up some recipes and try some stuff out. It sounds like you completely shun a hobby he enjoys and won't hear any part of it. Not saying anything negative is a good start, but you can express interest in his interest over the hobby even if you don't like it yourself.\n\nWhy does your husband like hunting? Does he hunt more than deer? There is also turkey season and other things you can hunt as well, not just deer.\n\nNow onto his end, he knows you don't like deer and tried to make deer as a holiday dinner for you two. Yay he tried to cook.\n\nDid you acknowledge the effort when he said he was cooking, or did you launch straight to \"you know I don't like deer\".) Because there is a difference between them.\n\nHim: I planned to make dinner tonight, I wanted to make you deer pot roast\n\nYou option 1: thank you for making dinner, I don't really like deer though, if I picked up some beef could we make that instead?\n\nYou option 2: you know I don't like deer, let's make beef instead\n\nA compliment can do wonders to show you appreciate the effort even if you don't like the result. The fact that he pressed on despite you voicing your opinion was a turd move, though.\n\nYou mention you've been having problems in the relationship. The problems could be going both ways. It sounds like neither of you are even interested in what makes each other happy, so long as it's kept away from you.\n\nYou say you feel unwanted and from his reaction over the dinner, it sounds like he may be feeling the same way", "OP clearly stated why she won\u2019t eat deer at least the ones her husband kill and cooks.

Do you source where all your meat comes from?", "Hey if you dont like the taste, you dont like it. \n\nBut if this is deer he is hunting it is likely the most ethically sourced meat you will get.", "I agree.  I absolutely hate the taste of venison. My father used to tell me something was made with beef to get me to eat it and I could tell every time.

I got the impression she never tried venison and will not try venison simply because he obtained it as a result of his hobby (hunting) and she thinks he cares more about his hobby than he does for her, so that is her line in the sand.  In other words, there is a deeper issue here than what meat is served for dinner.", "Yes, she did - after I already posted this comment.", "I would like to hear it from OP, is it venison in general she does not like, or is it because it was taken in a hunt.", "The problem is this seems to be more about the source of the meat rather than the meat itself.", "I've eaten deer meat maybe a half dozen times, cooked in various ways, but I do NOT  like it. I'd be unhappy if it was served to me for Christmas dinner.", "She said it's because she's an animal lover, not because of the taste of deer meat.", "Yeah I\u2019d say she\u2019s in the majority opinion not wanting to eat venison but eating other types of meat.

That snippet of comment should have went with the hunting reasoning, not the taste reason. Will check and edit if I did that backwards above here\n\nEdit:checked, and I put it in the right line. If it was just about taste, I could understand that although there are recipes that help make deer taste less gamey, you just need to find one you like.
