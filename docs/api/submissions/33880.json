If this is about the taste like you're leaning into more than the not liking hunting aspect. There are ways to get rid of or minimize the gamey-ness.

Not saying anything negative is a good start, but you can express interest in his interest over the hobby even if you don't like it yourself.\n\nWhy does your husband like hunting? Does he hunt more than deer? There is also turkey season and other things you can hunt as well, not just deer.\n\nNow onto his end, he knows you don't like deer and tried to make deer as a holiday dinner for you two.

There are plenty of places where feral dogs are overpopulated", "Most grocery stores? Where are you?!? I've never seen deer on sale anywhere, and I'm pretty sure it's actually illegal to sell in many instances in my state. \n\nPlease try again, but maybe with some info and less condescension next time.", "That seems like odd phrasing, especially when they apparently have people over for him to go off on her in front of.  It is far more likely that he said he was cooking dinner.", "Well, she\u2019s said she\u2019s tried it and doesn\u2019t like it so let\u2019s rule that out", "I can't personally kill an animal either, but I still eat meat. Venison can be tough if not prepared correctly, but if that was her only problem then she should help him learn how to cook it.", "She\u2019s not hunting it. Her husband is and he\u2019s not asking her to. She has a high and mighty attitude about it because she\u2019s \u201can animal lover\u201d, but seemingly thinks other forms of killing to eat meat are more humane.", "Respectfully, it\u2019s a really dumb point of view.\n\nThe animals are hunted after living lives free and in their natural habitat. The factory farmed meat you eat is from animals raised in horrific conditions- cows that literally never touch grass and are coated in excrement and filth because they\u2019re so tightly packed together.\n\nI\u2019m a meat eater, but you must recognize the insane logical inconsistency of your stance", "He's clearly not hunting just as a hobby if he's actually eating the meat afterwards. What hobby hunters do you know who are killing more than they can eat? You can only get a certain number of deer each season, and it freezes very well. Nobody is going out in the cold, early morning just to sit in a tree quietly for a few hours and then not eat what they shoot.   FYI, deer hunting is really important in the US, because without it, there would be too many of them. They would just die because of starvation and disease.    \n\nBut sure, buy a bunch of steaks and chicken breasts at the grocery store! Those animals were treated so much better than the ones who lived their lives out in the wild.", "Show me a store in North America that sells dog or cat meat for human consumption legally. I'll wait.", "She very clearly states in the post that he said he was making dinner for her, ignored her appeals to him about not liking dear and wanting him to make something she likes, and then he threw a temper tantrum about not getting adequate praise for doing less than the bare minimum. \n\nHe\u2019s a major asshole and you\u2019re an asshole for defending him.", "Then why even bring up the hunting?  It's as simple as \"No thanks I don't like the taste of venison.\"", "Meanwhile the meat she\u2019s willing to eat is from literally tortured animals\n\nGod it\u2019s so stupid it honestly makes me mad lol", "Ok, let me clarify, I don't like HOBBY hunting. Hunting for need or as a cheaper alternative to store or farm bought I'm ok with. But again, I couldn't do it myself because I couldn't kill an animal. I also don't personally know any hunters, so I don't have any as a source of food, so I get store bought.", "I\u2019m not talking about legality in North America. I\u2019m asking about your personal comfort which doesn\u2019t seem to be a concern of yours to OP since she should just eat it up since it\u2019s more humane than factory meat even though she\u2019s made it known she\u2019s not comfortable with it."]}
