I graduated high school at 17 yo so I could move out the day I grabbed my diploma. I couch surfed for a couple of months until I turned 18 and got my first apparent at 18yo with my boyfriend. We worked minimum wage jobs, working 60+ hours a week so my bf and I could afford rent. When we moved in, we only had a bed, a small 30 in TV, my bfs xbox, and toiletries. Nothing else.\n\nOver the next two years, we began saving up money to get our first car. After getting a car we applied to a job that paid more for fewer hours. We get raises every few months and profit sharing every quarter. We slowly began to update our apartment. Now, the only thing we were missing was a couch.\n\nThe couch was donated to us by our apartment. Someone got evicted from their unit and left everything in there. The office, knowing we don't have a couch yet, gave us the couch.\n\nAfter all of the upgrades we decided to start hosting D&D at our house, just me, my bf (the DM), my BIL, and my sister who weighs a whopping 375 lbs.\n\nMy sister couldn't fit into any of our chairs, so she sat on our couch. We originally didn't have a problem with this until we noticed our couch began to divet in the middle, and the bar that held the futon together underneath started to bend.\n\nMy bf and I agreed we'd buy her a chair that's built for her weight. The chair just came in, and we had D&D on Friday. We showed the chair to my sister, hoping she would be grateful, we paid over $100 for this. We're not rich, so we had to dip into our savings to pay for this.\n\nMy sister got mad at us, accusing us of calling her fat. We tried to calm her down, but trying to calm her down just made her scream more.\n\nMy BIL was telling us to look at what we started, I have to go home to this. You got this couch for free, just buy another one, etc.\n\nWith my sister screaming in one ear and my BIL talking in the other, I lost it.\n\nI said (summarizing): \"Everyone, shut the f**k up! You are completely right! Your fat a*s is breaking our couch. You can lose weight easily but choose to stay a fat, slob. This is a problem you can literally run from, but you chose to be fat and collect taxpayers' money to stay home and eat more and gain more weight. Until you lose weight under 250 lbs. you're not allowed on our couch again.\"\n\nI admit it was a bit much, and I should have a better control on my feelings. I feel bad for saying what I said on Friday, but it felt good to finally say it. Last night, my BIL was texting me, saying my \"bullying\" caused her to have a mental breakdown, and I should apologize.

I don\u2019t believe you should let someone destroy your furniture just to not hurt her feelings. Obesity is a very serious problem and generally should be addressed before it kills the individual.", "ESH. You were NTA until your outburst. There was no need to scream about 'tax payers money' and calling her a fat slob. Just clearly stating that she is damaging your furniture and that is not fair on you was enough. The suggestion of you buying another couch would be enough to kick then out for disrespecting your property.\n\nYou stated you grew up in an abusive household so her weight, mental health and eating habits may have been due to this. You certainly didn't help here.", "ESH. She is fat and she shouldn't freak out about the chair. You on the other hand spit pure venom back at her. You called her a slob and accused her of just collecting welfare checks.\n\nYou both grew up in an abusive household and probably cope in different ways. You ever think her weight was a result of that?", "NTA \n\nShe cant just show up and break your furniture. I think what you said was harsh but something she needed to hear", "ESH. Your sister for trying to underestimate (or ignore) her weight and you for all the hurtful stuff you said in the end. It was sweet that you bought her a chair instead of excluding her altogether but you just can't say stuff like you did,  especially not to someone who struggles with weight", "ESH. Here\u2019s why: \n\n1-You went out of your way to accommodate her, which tbh was a nice gesture since most people wouldn\u2019t especially if they\u2019re struggling financially. \n\n2-She took offense to it, not realizing that her weight was breaking your furniture, and let her insecurities get the best of her. \n\n3-Your BIL should\u2019ve diffused the situation instead of affirming your sister\u2019s beliefs \n\n4- you took the AH cake with that whole rant you went on. It was unnecessary. Yes, they were ungrateful, but to go on such a hateful rant was very telling of the kind of personality you have.

She thinks that breaking your couch is ok?? Wow.\n\nHaving said that, your comments went a tad too far. Would have stopped with calling her fat and damaging your property- this makes it ESH", "Jesus ducking Christ YTA calling her a slob? A fucking bizzare reference to tax money?

That's appalling. \nMany people have issues with their weight and a reliance on food, many are well aware of those issues but are stuck in how to deal with it. \nI assume your sister also grew up in this abusive household, have you thought that her weight problem could stem from her childhood? Food becomes a comfort. \n\nYou were unnecessarily cruel and gained satisfaction from it.", "I would\u2019ve originally said NTA but tbh ESH. There are different reasons why people are overweight for sure, and you did the right thing by buying a specially made couch for her, and i don\u2019t think she should\u2019ve made as big of a deal out of it as she did.

I was totally with you until you went completely nuclear and cruel. Shame on you.", "YTA.

Not because you provided a chair but for your comments. The Fat Positive Body movement/community has often said one of its concerns with accessibility is chairs that support their weight. You provided proper accommodation. Honestly, a couch is far more expensive than a chair and a dedicated chair says you went out of your way to ensure she could be comfortable.", "Nta I read where you said you were over stimulated when both started yelling at you. Feels like they pushed you into you expressing your inner thoughts. Everyone calling you the ah is acting like they have never snapped when multiple people are yelling at them, specially family. You bought her a chair from your savings which means you were taking her comfort over any emergency that you might have by still purchasing a chair that could support her weight.", "YTA. I was on your side until you said what you said. It absolutely was too much; frankly, it was spiteful.\n\nYou really want an apology because she, completely unintentionally, damaged your sofa? And you don't think you owe her an apology for insulting her? Wild.\n\n'You can lose weight easily but choose to stay a fat, slob.'\n\nThis is quite an ignorant view. Maybe do some reading on obesity and the psychology behind this?", "YTA\nNot for wanting your Sil to sit in a chair made for her, but for the fatshaming bullshit you said to her.", "ESH, but you were unnecessarily cruel to boot.", "Ooof honestly, YTA. I didn't think you were until you went off the rails with this:\n\n>**Everyone, shut the f\\*\\*k up! You are completely right! Your fat a\\*s is breaking our couch.

But the way you handled it was really mean. You could have worded that in so many different (nicer) ways, but you chose to dig further into her insecurity while she was already feeling defensive about her weight. \n\nYou're NTA for asking her to not sit on the couch again, but YTA for pretty much everything else you said. \n\nAlso, this really didn't help your case either:\n\n>**I told him I'd apologize when she apologizes for bending our couch.**\n\nObviously her bending your couch wasn't intentional. \n\nAnd lastly, your last comment:\n\n>**AITA for calling my sister fat by buying her a chair that supports her weight?**\n\nYou didn't necessarily call her fat by buying a chair. You just straight up called her fat. and a slob.", "YTA for that cruel and obnoxious outburst. \n\nI\u2019m betting you won\u2019t ever need to worry about her sitting on anything in your house ever again.", "YTA\n\nFirstly, don't spend 100 dollars specifically on someone without telling or warning before hand is a lesson here. Then again I guess having an extra chair can't hurt but yeah.\n\nShe was being an ass, and very rude. But that doesn't make you any more justified. You absolutely shamed her as a person, that's fucked up. You went too far. All you had to say is \"the couch isn't built to sustain weight as it isn't that well made, this chair is. We'd like to not damage our property so this is the chair we'll use.\" And you'd have stayed completely in the right. But you let it get personal.\n\nAnd saying \"a whopping 375lbs\" is already kinda a bit much. You aren't introducing a wrestler. That's a human that you know.\n\nYou knew what you said would be hurtful and demeaning, and you liked that. You'll never not be the asshole for that.", "YTA - And the \u2018whopping\u2019 comment describing your sister\u2019s weight tells us all we need to know about you.", "'You can lose weight easily but choose to stay a fat, slob. This is a problem you can literally run from, but you chose to be fat and collect taxpayers' money to stay home and eat more and gain more weight. '\n\nI was with you until this which was just fatphobia and a real lack of empathy given she also presumably grew up in an abusive household.

You now don't even feel bad for the cruel things you said or even recognise them as ignorant\n\nYTA", "No one appreciates a favor they didn't ask for, and the way you describe the chair thing it would read like a veiled insult. And then you went and fully unveiled the insult screaming at her like that. You shamed her, you were being abusive, and that's no matter how big she is or how bent your _free_ couch is. You hurt her. And I don't know how you'd repair this because you don't seem to care very much about her wellbeing. \nI've never been obese but I know what it's like to have suffered in childhood and turning to food for it.

She must have thought you were friends. \nEdit: YTA", "I\u2019m sorry OP but YTA\n\n1. That\u2019s your sister. She didn\u2019t choose to be fat.

You could have said something like nobody sit on the couch until we fix it the bar is broken and it will permanently damage the couch. In the meantime here is this super comfy chair.\n\n3. I understand your reaction to explode when you\u2019re being yelled at by multiple people. Maybe if this happens again in the future take some deep breaths and excuse yourself to a quiet place until you have your control back.\n\n4. Apologize. She\u2019s probably playing your words over and over again in her head.", "ESH. You totally said some things you shouldn't have.

I know that there are a number of factors. I know that it is not easy to just loose weight. Of course, it is your free choice, to be whatever you like. But freedom, as in many other ways, is not endless. As soon as you influence someone elses freedom ( in this case destroying their furnature), you have to take responsibility for that. You can not behave like a little child, who does not get its candy. If you do so, you cannot complain, if others get emotional as well and call them assholes for that. I have obese family members, even to this extent, but they by themselves do not use furnature, they might break. Mainly because they would feel most embarrased themselves. Of course I love them regardless.\n\nThe yelling and insults by itself are AH material, but there is a backstory we have to take into account.\n\nThat being said in general somebody with a BMI of over 40 is fat. (The sister prob is >50) And stating that such a person is fat is not an insult it is just a fact. Of course you could say fat is negatively connected and use some other word, but it comes down to the same thing. Normally it is not necessary to mention such things, of course, because those people usually now they are fat and know that it is unhealthly, so stating the obvious does not change anything, but makes everyone feel bad.\n\nBut the sister seems to be in denial of her weight, so stating the obvious seems to be necessary. The way is imo justified by her behaviour before.\n\nI do not want a BMI discussion. Of course there are limits, but even the best trained strongman do not go beyond 40 on BMI, and I doubt sister is just heavy with muscles and bones.", "Nah, she's not the asshole for that.
