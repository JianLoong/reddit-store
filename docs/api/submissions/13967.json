I graduated high school at 17 yo so I could move out the day I grabbed my diploma. I couch surfed for a couple of months until I turned 18 and got my first apparent at 18yo with my boyfriend. We worked minimum wage jobs, working 60+ hours a week so my bf and I could afford rent. When we moved in, we only had a bed, a small 30 in TV, my bfs xbox, and toiletries. Nothing else.\n\nOver the next two years, we began saving up money to get our first car. After getting a car we applied to a job that paid more for fewer hours. We get raises every few months and profit sharing every quarter. We slowly began to update our apartment. Now, the only thing we were missing was a couch.\n\nThe couch was donated to us by our apartment. Someone got evicted from their unit and left everything in there. The office, knowing we don't have a couch yet, gave us the couch.\n\nAfter all of the upgrades we decided to start hosting D&D at our house, just me, my bf (the DM), my BIL, and my sister who weighs a whopping 375 lbs.\n\nMy sister couldn't fit into any of our chairs, so she sat on our couch. We originally didn't have a problem with this until we noticed our couch began to divet in the middle, and the bar that held the futon together underneath started to bend.\n\nMy bf and I agreed we'd buy her a chair that's built for her weight. The chair just came in, and we had D&D on Friday. We showed the chair to my sister, hoping she would be grateful, we paid over $100 for this. We're not rich, so we had to dip into our savings to pay for this.\n\nMy sister got mad at us, accusing us of calling her fat. We tried to calm her down, but trying to calm her down just made her scream more.\n\nMy BIL was telling us to look at what we started, I have to go home to this. You got this couch for free, just buy another one, etc.\n\nWith my sister screaming in one ear and my BIL talking in the other, I lost it.\n\nI said (summarizing): \"Everyone, shut the f**k up! You are completely right! Your fat a*s is breaking our couch. You can lose weight easily but choose to stay a fat, slob. This is a problem you can literally run from, but you chose to be fat and collect taxpayers' money to stay home and eat more and gain more weight. Until you lose weight under 250 lbs. you're not allowed on our couch again.\"\n\nI admit it was a bit much, and I should have a better control on my feelings. I feel bad for saying what I said on Friday, but it felt good to finally say it. Last night, my BIL was texting me, saying my \"bullying\" caused her to have a mental breakdown, and I should apologize.

I don\u2019t believe you should let someone destroy your furniture just to not hurt her feelings. Obesity is a very serious problem and generally should be addressed before it kills the individual.", "ESH. You were NTA until your outburst. There was no need to scream about 'tax payers money' and calling her a fat slob. Just clearly stating that she is damaging your furniture and that is not fair on you was enough. The suggestion of you buying another couch would be enough to kick then out for disrespecting your property.\n\nYou stated you grew up in an abusive household so her weight, mental health and eating habits may have been due to this. You certainly didn't help here.", "ESH. She is fat and she shouldn't freak out about the chair. You on the other hand spit pure venom back at her. You called her a slob and accused her of just collecting welfare checks.\n\nYou both grew up in an abusive household and probably cope in different ways. You ever think her weight was a result of that?", "NTA \n\nShe cant just show up and break your furniture. I think what you said was harsh but something she needed to hear", "ESH. Your sister for trying to underestimate (or ignore) her weight and you for all the hurtful stuff you said in the end. It was sweet that you bought her a chair instead of excluding her altogether but you just can't say stuff like you did,  especially not to someone who struggles with weight", "ESH. Here\u2019s why: \n\n1-You went out of your way to accommodate her, which tbh was a nice gesture since most people wouldn\u2019t especially if they\u2019re struggling financially. \n\n2-She took offense to it, not realizing that her weight was breaking your furniture, and let her insecurities get the best of her. \n\n3-Your BIL should\u2019ve diffused the situation instead of affirming your sister\u2019s beliefs \n\n4- you took the AH cake with that whole rant you went on. It was unnecessary. Yes, they were ungrateful, but to go on such a hateful rant was very telling of the kind of personality you have.

Would have stopped with calling her fat and damaging your property- this makes it ESH", "Jesus ducking Christ YTA calling her a slob? A fucking bizzare reference to tax money?

That's appalling. \nMany people have issues with their weight and a reliance on food, many are well aware of those issues but are stuck in how to deal with it. \nI assume your sister also grew up in this abusive household, have you thought that her weight problem could stem from her childhood? Food becomes a comfort. \n\nYou were unnecessarily cruel and gained satisfaction from it.", "ESH. There are different reasons why people are overweight for sure, and you did the right thing by buying a specially made couch for her, and i don\u2019t think she should\u2019ve made as big of a deal out of it as she did.

I was totally with you until you went completely nuclear and cruel. Shame on you.", "YTA.

Not because you provided a chair but for your comments. The Fat Positive Body movement/community has often said one of its concerns with accessibility is chairs that support their weight. You provided proper accommodation. Honestly, a couch is far more expensive than a chair and a dedicated chair says you went out of your way to ensure she could be comfortable.", "Nta I read where you said you were over stimulated when both started yelling at you. Feels like they pushed you into you expressing your inner thoughts. Everyone calling you the ah is acting like they have never snapped when multiple people are yelling at them, specially family. You bought her a chair from your savings which means you were taking her comfort over any emergency that you might have by still purchasing a chair that could support her weight.", "YTA. I was on your side until you said what you said. It absolutely was too much; frankly, it was spiteful.\n\nYou really want an apology because she, completely unintentionally, damaged your sofa? And you don't think you owe her an apology for insulting her? Wild.\n\n'You can lose weight easily but choose to stay a fat, slob.'\n\nThis is quite an ignorant view.

But the way you handled it was really mean. You could have worded that in so many different (nicer) ways, but you chose to dig further into her insecurity while she was already feeling defensive about her weight. \n\nYou're NTA for asking her to not sit on the couch again, but YTA for pretty much everything else you said. \n\nAlso, this really didn't help your case either:\n\n>**I told him I'd apologize when she apologizes for bending our couch.**\n\nObviously her bending your couch wasn't intentional. \n\nAnd lastly, your last comment:\n\n>**AITA for calling my sister fat by buying her a chair that supports her weight?**\n\nYou didn't necessarily call her fat by buying a chair. You just straight up called her fat. and a slob.", "YTA for that cruel and obnoxious outburst. \n\nI\u2019m betting you won\u2019t ever need to worry about her sitting on anything in your house ever again.", "YTA\n\nFirstly, don't spend 100 dollars specifically on someone without telling or warning before hand is a lesson here. Then again I guess having an extra chair can't hurt but yeah.\n\nShe was being an ass, and very rude. But that doesn't make you any more justified. You absolutely shamed her as a person, that's fucked up. You went too far. All you had to say is \"the couch isn't built to sustain weight as it isn't that well made, this chair is. We'd like to not damage our property so this is the chair we'll use.\" And you'd have stayed completely in the right. But you let it get personal.\n\nAnd saying \"a whopping 375lbs\" is already kinda a bit much. You aren't introducing a wrestler. That's a human that you know.\n\nYou knew what you said would be hurtful and demeaning, and you liked that. You'll never not be the asshole for that.", "YTA - And the \u2018whopping\u2019 comment describing your sister\u2019s weight tells us all we need to know about you.", "'You can lose weight easily but choose to stay a fat, slob. This is a problem you can literally run from, but you chose to be fat and collect taxpayers' money to stay home and eat more and gain more weight. '\n\nI was with you until this which was just fatphobia and a real lack of empathy given she also presumably grew up in an abusive household.

And then you went and fully unveiled the insult screaming at her like that. You shamed her, you were being abusive, and that's no matter how big she is or how bent your _free_ couch is. You hurt her. And I don't know how you'd repair this because you don't seem to care very much about her wellbeing. \nI've never been obese but I know what it's like to have suffered in childhood and turning to food for it.

She must have thought you were friends. \nEdit: YTA", "I\u2019m sorry OP but YTA\n\n1. That\u2019s your sister. She didn\u2019t choose to be fat.

You could have said something like nobody sit on the couch until we fix it the bar is broken and it will permanently damage the couch. In the meantime here is this super comfy chair.\n\n3. I understand your reaction to explode when you\u2019re being yelled at by multiple people. Maybe if this happens again in the future take some deep breaths and excuse yourself to a quiet place until you have your control back.\n\n4. Apologize. She\u2019s probably playing your words over and over again in her head.", "ESH. You totally said some things you shouldn't have.

Your sister is fat. She grew up in the same abusive household. Don't you think it's had a huge impact on her too? And to have you scream at her was probably a trigger for her. \nJust like having the sofa slowly be destroyed is a trigger for you because you've had to work so hard for everything you have. \nNAH to me, you're both triggered. You both need to find a way to deal with grewing up in abusive toxic family. You're probably both doing the best you can and it's not working.\nI grew up in an very abusive family.

In your self paraphrased quote, you seem to be making assumptions about why your sister is heavy and that she can make changes easily. Last, you\u2019ve assigned an arbitrary number to your sister\u2019s seating privileges in your home. It\u2019s not inherently bad to call someone fat and for many people it is a neutral descriptor of a physical characteristic. Instead, you are clearly using the word to describe what you see as character flaws. This is wrong, but I think you can grow from this! \n\nFrom your story, I can tell that you are capable of change and have a growth mindset. You\u2019ve accomplished a lot (with the partnership of your live in partner). You can do so much more with just a bit of effort and time. Educate yourself. Start with Aubrey Gordon\u2019s work. \n\nI will say that I recognize the frustration you must feel around your sister\u2019s reaction to seating that you bought specifically to accommodate her. Seating for fat folks is an accessibility issue. It\u2019s not uncommon for someone to arrive at a restaurant or theater or doctor\u2019s office and be unable to sit on the chairs provided due to the pain of the chair arms or hardware cutting into skin. Check in and see if the new chair is comfortable for sister.\n\nFinally, I assume your sister is sitting on that futon for maybe 3-4 hours a week. How many hours are you sitting on it each week playing Xbox? It\u2019s simply poor logic to assume that one person\u2019s usage is affecting the wear and tear on the futon even if you and partner are lighter. \n\nHere\u2019s your to do list: You owe your sister an apology for the assault on her character. Ask her if the new chair is comfortable and what she does/doesn\u2019t like about it. It sounds like this might be new for you, but again I can tell you\u2019re capable of growth: try to understand why she\u2019s upset. Finally, look up Aubrey Gordon - even just on Instagram.

There is every chance she has a condition that prevents her from losing weight. Reaching 375 pounds is not something that happens by just overeating. Calling her a fat slob, saying she can lose weight whenever she likes, and that she's a drain on taxpayer money are all awful things to say to someone who's overweight because there is every chance that she can't lose weight in the same way as someone who's able bodied.

You didn\u2019t mean to make her feel good about herself. Having an outburst because of how she spoke to you is fine, resorting to name calling an verbal abuse isn\u2019t", "OP, my brother is nearing 600lbs and his partner isn't far behind. They are HUGE and we had to buy special furniture just to accommodate them. Their weight is a symptom, nothing more, nothing less. They can't address the weight until we get them in a better situation and into therapy. They are both abuse survivors and struggle to access healthy food due to the fact they struggle to have the energy to cook or go grocery shopping. I don't think your sister wants to be that heavy, do you? There are far better ways of communicating your worries and concerns without accusing her of stealing resources. It sounds like you need to work on shedding that abusive past too. I would wait for her to calm down, apologize and ask her how she thinks discussions about her weight should happen. You can't be that heavy and ignore the fact that your weight causes physical challenges that need to be solved. So, how do you solve those physical challenges without hurting her feelings? I bet asking her that will help. It did with my brother.", "Yea you did.", "I don\u2019t buy the \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt her feelings\u201d for a single second. There is no way you didn\u2019t know how hurtful those words would be.\n\nI struggle with my weight, too, and I can assure you of a couple of things. First, it is not at all easy to lose weight. Second, fat people never need to be told they\u2019re fat. We are far more aware of it than anyone else. Third, shaming a person for their weight does not help most people slim down. Studies show that it actually has the opposite effect. \n\nI\u2019m not saying your sister was in the right. But the things you said definitely make this a YTA situation in my opinion.", "You should stand on what you said, you absolutely meant to hurt her feelings.", "You ARE abusive. You did mean to say it. You were cruel and made a show of her weight. Take her to the side and calmly explain the situation, and look for a seat together. And show the \u00a3100 chair.", "Cruelty and shame are sure ways to drive someone deep into old coping behavior though, OP. It never helps anyone change for the better. And in that moment, you weren\u2019t worried about your sister\u2019s health. You wanted to hurt her enough to shut her up and punish her for not being grateful that you spent money on a sturdy chair. \n\nYou were both AHs, but she acted like an AH because she got hurt. She was surprised by a big reminder of how fat she is in a place where she felt comfortable, safe, and valued. That\u2019s why she lashed out. When you\u2019re that heavy, you\u2019re reminded of it every minute of every day. You feel it with every step you take and you see it in the eyes of everyone who looks at you. You try to make yourself as small and as nothing as possible because of shame and pain. And you can\u2019t just diet and exercise it away easy peasy, because the reason you\u2019re fat is not because you\u2019re lazy and like food. You\u2019re fat because you learned early in life that being small and cute is dangerous, and your body needs that fat to feel big and unattractive enough to be left alone. You\u2019re fat because you\u2019re using food as an anesthetic for pain so deep you don\u2019t even know how to get at it. You\u2019re fat because it helps you survive, and the hardest thing in the world is to give up a survival mechanism. And you\u2019re fat because now your survival mechanism is murdering you and you\u2019re paralyzed by fear. You\u2019re also fat because decades of crap food have totally deranged your gut microbiome and when you try to change your eating habits, billions of hungry bacteria go nuts and send out chemical messages that create insane cravings. It takes a lot of knowledge, time, and a strong sense of self-worth to change that. Even though it wasn\u2019t meant as a jab, the \u201cfat chair\u201d told your sister that the one place she could go out and feel free and normal was just another place she was too big to be acceptable.\n\nI don\u2019t believe that you, on the other hand, were actually hurt by her outburst, even if you were surprised by it. That\u2019s why I vote YTA. I think you got angry because you got an unexpected response, and all the mean, judgmental thoughts you\u2019ve had about your sister, her weight, and her life came pouring out. What you did was ugly and hateful. You feel superior to your sister and you wanted to make sure she felt less than. And, sure, BIL was a moron for suggesting you buy a new futon, but you know he was just scrambling to manage his wife\u2019s response. He said a bunch of nonsense because he was surprised too. None of you have the maturity or self-control to stay kind, fair, and gracious when life throws you a curveball. \n\nYou should apologize, first in writing so she has time to think, and then in person. You hurt someone you claim you love, unintentionally to start with and then intentionally.  I get that this is a relationship full of pain and scarring because you\u2019ve both experienced abuse, but it\u2019s time for you to do the work you need to take control of your trauma so it doesn\u2019t hijack your behavior the way it did with your sister. Being kind, responsible, and humble now is a good way to start. Maybe it will inspire her to do some work on her own trauma too.", "Yet u did hurt her feelings", "I would argue that the outburst was abusive, but that by itself wouldn\u2019t be enough for me to peg OP as an abuser.", "No, but it should be cause for self reflection, whereas OP is just saying \u201cit felt good to say it.\u201d", "those aren't the only two options lol", "Fr, one outburst is apparently blatant abuse lmfao", "Nice false dichotomy.", "A lot of redditors, especially the ones who spend a lot of time on this sub, found this story hitting way too close to home - and they aren't identifying with OP in it.", "Just realized..

The reason OP is NTA, despite the harshness of her delivery, is because sister acted SUPER entitled and so did BIL. \u201cYou got this for free, just go buy a new one\u201d severely implicates that neither of them acknowledge what OP has been through or that they care.

They spent over $100 just so she could be comfortable in their home when she visits, and instead of being grateful, she takes it personally. \n\nWhether or not the rant was okay isn't something I want to parse, but your version of events ignores some context. \n\nFor the record, she had to know the couch was bending. There's no way you wouldn't be able to feel it if someone else can see it happening, so it's also rude to just... continue to break the furniture", "It is fatphobic that OP called her a fat slob and to just \"start running to lose weight\".", "People also don't choose to have other mental health issues but guess what.. they can choose to get help and make changes for themselves.

Saying \"fuck it\" is destructive for everyone involved, not just the individual.", "So, being fat gives the sister carte blanche to damage the OP's furniture, and to get upset when that fact is mentioned? I'm sorry, but 375lbs IS fat. I don't care if you want to try tapdancing around it, but that IS fat, and I guarantee you that the sister's ass was not spared the weight gain. \n\nYou also don't know whether or not the sister is a slob. Being fat does not inherently make one a slob, but there's nothing that stops the possibility. I've known some larger people who are always impeccably put together, and others who I never see without stains on their shirts with their bellies hanging out. I would call ANYONE who showed up in a food and sweat stained shirt a slob. It's not inherently tied to being larger, but they can coexist. Perhaps the OP calling her sister a fat slob was a simple fact. The truth can hurt, but it doesn't stop it from being true.

We can never assume. \n\nSo sure, point out you got a chair especially for her. Point out you'd rather her not use the couch because it's getting damaged.

Abuse affects different children in different ways, and it's easily possible your sister's weight problem is a consequence of the abuse. \n\nI don't know when her weight problems began - but significant weight problems are rarely about 'greed'. When children don't feel loved and protected, it sometimes activates a primeval desire to eat as much as possible - since there's a fear they will possibly be abandoned by their parents, when their parents don't seem to like them. Abandoned children would be at risk of starving in many eras, when these survival genes were programmed into humans. \n\nOr alternatively, food is the only thing that gives them a sense of comfort (in the absence of caring adults) - again, because food is associated with survival and being cared for. These (often subconscious) anxieties can remain hardwired into these children, when they become adults. And they are NOT easy to just 'undo'.\n\nIt sounds like you both need therapy, to gain insight into how your childhood is still affecting you. About a third of abused children never become abusers, regardless of circumstances. Another third are abusive most of the time. And the remaining third can be abusive, when under stress. But there's NEVER an excuse for it. \n\nDon't let your childhood turn you into an abuser, who refuses to have appropriate empathy or understanding towards family. It WILL come out again when you're frustrated. I'd hate that to happen to your own children in the future, should you ever have them.", "Of course this was an asshole move; it's absurd you'd have to ask. It's clear you have nothing but disdain and disgust for fat people. I'm not sure how you expected NOT to come off poorly in this- what, because you bought something (without the recipient's knowledge or input?). Buying shit doesn't make you an angel.\n\nAre body issues extremely emotional? Would it be obvious that it's something to tread carefully around? You'd think. But instead, you acted like an asshole and then came here asking to be absolved. YTA.", "Jesus the fat-phobia in these comments. Senseless attacks just for being fat. I think the sister was out of line for expecting you to just buy something she had a part in damaging. But, \n\nYTA for the outburst and it totally cancels out any mindful good deed you did about getting a chair that accommodates her weight. Her weight obviously contributed to breaking your couch, but in no single way is accusing her of all the additional BS the answer. You have one idea of what fatness is and how people become that way and decided there\u2019s one simple solve-all solution. You\u2019re ignorant and an abuser yourself to think what you shouted at her was appropriate in any sense.", "YTA. Wow, how f'ing cruel are you. That you are from an abusive family is apparent. That you opt to not do better is also apparent.\n\nIt wasn't \"a bit much\" - you were mean AF. I'm sorry you care more about objects than humans. Do better.", "YTA for the outburst - not for buying her a chair. You traumatized her for life. I\u2019m very sad for her. She grew up in the same household as you and it seems obvious that she is coping with her trauma by using food as comfort.", "That rant you gave your sister at the end? Yeah, that's been building up for a while right? You've had that attitude towards your sister and those beliefs about fatness for a while now? You just never said anything to her?\n\nIt doesn't matter. She knows that you feel that way and that's why she was upset about getting the chair. There's a 99.9% chance that you have communicated your derisive attitude towards her fatness in other ways over the years, just without using words, or saying it directly about her.\n\nEver expressed concerns about your own weight or the way that you feel or look in clothes when you feel like maybe you look fat or that you look like you've gained weight? Ever talked about fitness regimes in front of your sister or those weight loss shows or diet plans advertised all the time, or made any comment about them? Do you think it's possible that your sister\u2014who potentially grew up in the same household you did, one that you say is abusive\u2014has faced abuse, derision, or other dehumanization growing up in that household, and that her fatness was used as a means of delivering that abuse (e.g. verbal abuse including name calling about fatness, withholding food because of fatness, or tying it to whatever forms of abuse she did experience)?,  Do you think that having these attitudes constantly around her\u2014some of which are likely from the same people who abused you\u2014has made her very sensitive to anyone commenting on her weight? And even if she didn't grow up in the same household, don't you think it's likely that if you, her sister\u2014one of the people who loves and cares about her most in the world\u2014is capable of saying something like that to her, that strangers and assholes have been saying it to her without any compunction whatsoever for a while now? \n\nThe fact of the matter is not that you finally told her those things and so she finally knows them now. Because she's been told those things 100,000 times, but only so directly by people who are either abusive or who didn't matter as much to her. The fact of the matter is that you have finally directly confirmed to her that you are among the ranks of the armies of assholes out there shouting at her about what a useless, horrible person she is for how much she weighs. \n\nPeople are saying that your little rant towards her was \"justifiable AH\" and therefore doesn't count. But you literally took better care of your furniture, cared more about damage that has been done to your furniture, than to your sister. Prioritizing the wellbeing of inanimate objects over the wellbeing of humans is always YTA.\n\nI'm not saying her behavior was good. She could (should) have responded happy for a chair and then have the discussion about the emotional aspect with her husband afterwards without bringing you into it. But if \"justifiable AH\" means it doesn't count, then she's not the problem here, because the context of your feelings about her fatness makes her response justifiable. You don't say that you didn't mean what you said. You said it felt good to finally say it, which means you've been thinking it for a while and that you meant it 100%. And the fact that your sister knew that that attitude existed in your mind by your presenting her the chair, even though you hadn't said it out loud, doesn't make your sister wrong. Does it? Cuz she was right, wasn't she? You do think all of those horrible things about her because of her weight. Are you actually mad that her intuition made her understand that that's how you felt even though you were just presenting a chair? Are you actually mad that she was upset by her completely accurate interpretation of your thoughts based on your actions?", "YTA- not for buying the chair, but for the outburst. Telling someone overweight that they can easily lose weight but are choosing to stay fat is extremely insensitive. You called her a slob. Don't you think she'd lose weight if she could? When someone is that overweight, they probably have mental health issues that go along with it or an eating disorder. Calling someone out like that is cruel. And it's not easy to lose weight, it's not as simple as choosing to do it. Some of us have huge barriers to overcome. \n\nRegarding the chair, a better option might have been to talk to her ahead of time. Let her know that you were happy to get a chair she'd be more comfortable in and show her what you were thinking of getting. Make her feel like part of the decision. \n\nYou can also let her know that you are there to support her if she wants to try and get healthier, or see a therapist or whatever. I would also apologize for what you said, it went way too far. Especially making sure to apologize for calling her a slob and the comment about it being easy to lose weight. \n\nHonestly, if my sister ever said to me what you said to your sister, I'd probably never speak to her again. You showed a lack of empathy that nobody deserves. How did you not think that you buying the chair wouldn't open up a difficult and uncomfortable conversation?", "YTA.

And if she was left in the house alone after OP split\u2026 it was probably worse for her.\n\nSister might be so over sensitive about their weight that having a private conversation about the furniture and financial situation also may have gone sideways.

Big sis clearly has opinions about little sisters life choices. And since big sis has had to claw her way to everything she has now, I can see how she would have resentment. And how she probably feels like since she did it and was able to get out and make a little life for herself why can\u2019t little sister. I\u2019m not sure if BIL is an enabler or not but I do think he is in the wrong now for blaming big for littles breakdown. A mental breakdown doesn\u2019t happen in a day. Or one event.

It sounds like you've got a set of beliefs about weight and health that have created a bit of a bias (and maybe even resentment) towards people who are overweight.\n\nYou absolutely could have been blunt with your sister and told her that apparently your couch has a limited amount of weight it can support, and that it's breaking. That is true and honest. There's absolutely no issue with you buying a chair for her (that was, in fact, very kind), and her blowing up and getting offended does make her an asshole. Considering the circumstances, calling her \"fat\" was also true and she's the one that first felt the need to say it out loud and then get defensive.\n\nThe way that you answered her, though, makes me worry about the way that you think about and treat all fat people.\n\nI've done some extensive research on nutrition and health and worked closely with several expert nutritionists and specialized doctors.\n\n* Once someone has gained weight, their body changes forever. If an overweight person manages to lose some weight, their metabolism does not go back to what it was before the weight gain. So if that person originally was able to maintain a good weight (maybe female, 5'4\", 120 lbs, moderately sedentary) eating 1800 calories/day, after the weight gain (and then loss), their body can no longer maintain that same weight eating 1800 calories/day. They would now need to eat less (how much depends on their body + how much weight gain, but maybe 1200-1600 cals/day) - just to maintain their new current weight.\n* There is so much wrong with the US food industry, one being that there's hidden sugar in practically everything. And with rising costs, the access to healthy food is getting more difficult. Foods that are cheap tend to be sugary and high in unhealthy carbs (chips, pastries).\n* People have many different reasons for gaining weight - some of them are physical and/or genetic and out of their control.

If the US did a better job of making healthy food accessible and affordable (+also allowed the average workday to have time for exercise), they could make a lot more impact instead of bitching about \"fat people\" draining resources. Not to mention that the US government caused a good chunk of the health crisis (by listening to one biased man and letting him create the original Food Pyramid that actually messed up American health to what it is today and ALSO by not regulating the quality of food people are allowed to sell.

She's coping, just like you are.  But there is never an excuse to talk to someone the way you did - that was the abuse talking, where you lose control and go for blood.

I won't go into the latest scientific findings and research, but people who are fat generally have metabolic problems that are keeping them fat.  No one is fat by choice.\n\nThe other reason people get fat is because of extreme trauma or extreme depression.  If you see a little girl all of a sudden put on LOTS of weight, and you don't know that something traumatic happened to her like she was in a car accident with her mother and her mother died (to use an example I'm aware of) then it's highly likely that she was sexually assaulted (SA).  Your body has complex mechanisms that involve adrenaline and cortisol and other hormones that will kick in if you experience extreme trauma, especially if you're powerless to control your circumstances, which children are.  The road to becoming fat has many on ramps, is what I'm saying, and no one chooses to take one; the choice is usually made for you without your consent.

To resolve the issue, maybe you should apologize for *not letting her know in advance* that your couch (blame it on the couch) isn't strong enough for everyone's combined weight so you got her a special chair.

In fact, OP, a most important transition anyone should make into adulthood is learning how to express anger without descending into name calling.

They go out of their way to give you some axe body spray and make a big show about it. This was special axe body spray it cost $52.00!  Imagine you had been abused for it growing up. Imagine you were scared to shower because of sexual abuse by your father and so now you get triggered when people bring it up. Everytime you showered he would break in to watch you naked.

And I'm sorry, but anybody that thinks it should be easy for a 375 pound person to lose weight is an asshole. You don't get to 375 pounds without underlying issues, and sometimes, losing weight permanently requires untangling those issues. If those issues are from repeated childhood traumas, good stinking luck untying those knots. Personally, I was skinny as a rail until the next door neighbor started molesting me. I was also physically and emotionally abused at home. My entire childhood was a fight to survive... and eating made me feel better.\n\n\n\n\nI know the underlying issues. I know at least some of the disorders, but except for a few years where I was obsessed with exercise, I've been unable to do anything. I also have underlying medical issues that have gotten worse over the years to where I'm now wheelchair bound. I've got arthritis that makes moving painful... I've given up gaming even because using a keyboard or controller hurts my hands. My suffering was invisible to people until it became too much to bear.

They're obese by choice. They can change that.
