She asked if her cousin\u2019s son could stay with me Friday (tomorrow) until Tuesday, which is essentially less than 24h notice. He\u2019s underage and is apparently researching universities in my city. I live in the UK, the boy lives in Eastern Europe. When I asked when did he buy his ticket to my city (as that should be done in advance) she said today (they day before he was supposed to come). \n\nWhat is more I have plans for the weekend, a friend staying over in the guest bedroom and a roommate, who is very openly gay (my family is a very conservative, homophobic Christian family). \n\nI said that I can\u2019t host since I have a friend staying over at the weekend. She said if I could ask my friends if he could stay over with them as he can\u2019t book a hotel as he\u2019s underage and if I could find time to take care of him. I said I don\u2019t even know his name, not to mention never met him or his father or actually anyone from his family before in my life. I have no idea who this person is (to which my mom responded \u201ca good person\u201d). I don\u2019t think my mom ever met him as well, as she\u2019s not in touch with her family much. \n\nWhen I recommended airBNB or a youth hotel she said that I\u2019m being rude and unhelpful and she\u2019s not raised me to be so unkind. She seemed very disappointed in me and abruptly ended the call. I feel like garbage now. \n\nSo am I the asshole? I feel like I\u2019m not but her reaction makes me feel otherwise.\n\nUPDATE: the boy now has a hotel booked so looks like that was perfectly doable from the start. My mom said it was her idea for him to stay with me as it\u2019s \u201cthe best to be with a family\u201d. This person is a complete stranger to me.\n\nUPDATE 2: after consulting my younger brother (who lives with her) my mother surprisingly realised she was being unreasonable and I was actually not horrendous. She asked if I could meet the boy for a coffee one evening to talk to him about the UK, the city I live in and the universities and I said okay.", "created_utc": 1686833885, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14a1saw/aita_for_refusing_to_host_an_underage_boy_in_my/", "score": 811, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You shouldn't be expected to accommodate this for a number of reasons, but especially because you are already hosting and it would be incredibly inappropriate for you to ask your guest to share the space with a stranger. Honestly that suggestion is bizarre to me. Shrug - your family / cousin's child did inadequate planning. Your residence in the city is irrelevant to their problem, and isn't the solution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: PS, it sounds like maybe your mom volunteered your space without talking to you, which was grossly inappropriate, and now wants you to comply so that she can 'save face' or not have to go back and undo it.
