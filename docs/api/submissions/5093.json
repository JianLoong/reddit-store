I\u2019m sorry that your dad isn\u2019t supportive of you but it seems like you do have other family members who are. I think you made the right decision in not helping him move and not letting yourself be used like that. It\u2019s not the end of the world he can find other people to help or just do it on his own. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being petty at all. I\u2019d maybe leave lines of communication open though, allow him the opportunity to make amends and apologise if he changes and can be accepting.  Also his family calling you a girl? That just sounds so homophobic. Honestly don\u2019t understand how in this day and age people can be nasty and hateful over someone\u2019s romantic and s**ual interests, it really doesn\u2019t concern them and shouldn\u2019t change their relationship with a person or how they are treated.", "NTA \n1. He is a drug addict\n2. He is the reason u r getting evicted\n3. He talked about you behind ur back\n4.

Absolutely not. Ur too kind in my opinion", "NTA, and no it isn't petty to avoid Toxic people.  It's called being a responsible adult.
