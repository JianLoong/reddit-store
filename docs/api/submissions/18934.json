My wife is a SAHM and we're happy with this arrangement because I work a lot(I'm a heart surgeon) and we wanted our daughter to have adequate attention from at least one parent. Moreover, my wife didn't want to pursue her career after she conceived. \n\nMy family has always been very vocal about women getting educated and working even after marriage. My mother, my sisters, my aunts. All of them are highly educated and have successful careers. \n\nWhen we got married, she was working as an elementary school teacher. My mother didn't approve of our marriage because she wanted a more career oriented woman for me. But she came around after about a year of our marriage because I told her straight up that I didn't like her disrespecting my wife and we couldn't meet anymore if she didn't even try to be civil towards my wife. After that everything was going fine.... At least until my brother got married. His wife is a corporate lawyer and obviously my mother dotes on her so much because she's  apparently \"independent, headstrong, etc. etc.\" My wife feels insecure about it because my mother has never treated her that well. I asked her not to worry about it because my mother's opinion of her doesn't matter that much. \n\nWell, coming back to the situation, my brother and sister in law have a 10 year old daughter. She and our daughter play together every weekend since we all stay in the same neighbourhood. The thing is my niece goes to ballet and piano classes. She also has a private tutor. This is because her mom wants her to go to an Ivy league college. \n\nOur daughter just goes for art classes because she loves painting. \n\nSo yesterday, we all went to my mom's place for a family get together. After lunch, my wife said she'd bake cookies and a cake for teatime. The kids also went with her to help. While they were baking, my sister in law came home. She had gone to pick something up urgently from her friend after lunch. \n\nShe was furious on seeing her daughter in the kitchen baking with the other kids. She yelled at my wife saying that she has no rights to teach her daughter to be a traditional woman. I calmed her down and apologized saying that it wasn't our intention to interfere with her parenting and that my wife was just trying to do something fun with the kids. But she wasn't ready to listen and my mother joined in saying that she didn't mind my wife being a housewife but my wife shouldn't make the kids be like her(i.e. a housewife). She said that they were trying to make the kids be successful and my wife was trying to do the opposite. My wife started to cry and ran out of the house to the car. I told my mother that I wouldn't be crossing her doorstep again until she apologizes to my wife. Then I left  their house immediately with my daughter. \n\nI've been getting messages from my dad saying that I  should go back home.

They are demeaning your wife for not being \"the right kind of woman.\" Feminists haven't fought throughout history for women's equality to simply change the ways in which women are dictated to and demeaned.  It's about supporting a woman's right to choose her own path in life, not dictating who or what she should be, and making sure women have the same opportunities as men. If you take away the choice of being a SAHM, or at the very least demean it, how is this different than taking away a woman's choice to become a doctor or lawyer etc.? You're still telling women what they should and should not be, which is just wrong.\n\nAlso, I've never understood why caring for children is so devalued. Our teachers, daycare workers and anyone working with children should be valued right up there with doctors, lawyers etc. They are caring for and educating our CHILDREN!!

That's some pretty shitty parenting if they do.\n\nFinally, why do your mother and SIL want your niece to grow up to be a useless, entitled adult who can't take care of themselves? How will she learn basic life skills if she doesn't practice with the adults in her life? My 18-year-old son spent a lot of time over the years, including his teen years, learning to bake from my grandmother (a woman who had her own career and separate finances, btw, something not common for her generation).

There is a YouTuber (Sugarologie) I watch who recently did a scientific breakdown on how she made frosting really colorful, like some colors are difficult to get, red, black, etc. She is a baking scientist, like literally learnt it and that's how she came up with it.\n\nOP is NTA and I would also even restrict access to your daughter, OP.

Cooking, cleaning, doing laundry-maintaining and running a house are basic life skills that every individual should know. Money, success, steady employment can be here today and gone tomorrow. Great Depression/Great recession much. People may not always be able to afford or want to spend the money necessary to farm out those life skills. It\u2019s better to learn them young and have to brush up on them if need be than to have to get a crash course as an adult. \n\nThere are plenty of crazy successful people who also know how to keep their homes.

One extreme or the other is never healthy. Just as ONLY supporting education and careers is not healthy neither would it be healthy to say that a woman\u2019s place is ONLY in the home. Being supportive only if someone shares your goals is not ideal. Not everyone wants to be a lawyer/doctor/corporate climber. Not everyone should be. Not everyone should be a stay at home parent. \n\nI fear what would happen to any of the young girls if they decided not to pursue higher education or a career that is not as demanding. Being torn down for doing something you prefer by the people who should love and support you wouldn\u2019t just be demoralizing it would be tragic and cause lifelong issues.

The thing about domestic labor is that it needs to be done.  It sounds like the dream in OP\u2019s family is to make enough money to have a maid and a personal chef.  Whereas in my family, I was certainly encouraged to do something with the brains I was given\u2026but I grew up on the sane farm my maternal grandmother grew up on, so there was never shame associated with developing the skills needed to perform basic, self-care work such as cooking and cleaning.  In fact, those things were explicitly taught as necessary life skills.  The key is that they were taught to both me and my brother, and now he\u2019s a feminist husband to his wife, a physician, and takes care of most of the cooking and plenty of the cleaning.
