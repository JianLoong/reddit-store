My wife is a SAHM and we're happy with this arrangement because I work a lot(I'm a heart surgeon) and we wanted our daughter to have adequate attention from at least one parent. Moreover, my wife didn't want to pursue her career after she conceived. \n\nMy family has always been very vocal about women getting educated and working even after marriage. My mother, my sisters, my aunts. All of them are highly educated and have successful careers. \n\nWhen we got married, she was working as an elementary school teacher. My mother didn't approve of our marriage because she wanted a more career oriented woman for me. But she came around after about a year of our marriage because I told her straight up that I didn't like her disrespecting my wife and we couldn't meet anymore if she didn't even try to be civil towards my wife. After that everything was going fine.... At least until my brother got married. His wife is a corporate lawyer and obviously my mother dotes on her so much because she's  apparently \"independent, headstrong, etc. etc.\" My wife feels insecure about it because my mother has never treated her that well. I asked her not to worry about it because my mother's opinion of her doesn't matter that much. \n\nWell, coming back to the situation, my brother and sister in law have a 10 year old daughter. She and our daughter play together every weekend since we all stay in the same neighbourhood. The thing is my niece goes to ballet and piano classes. She also has a private tutor. This is because her mom wants her to go to an Ivy league college. \n\nOur daughter just goes for art classes because she loves painting. \n\nSo yesterday, we all went to my mom's place for a family get together. After lunch, my wife said she'd bake cookies and a cake for teatime. The kids also went with her to help. While they were baking, my sister in law came home. She had gone to pick something up urgently from her friend after lunch. \n\nShe was furious on seeing her daughter in the kitchen baking with the other kids. She yelled at my wife saying that she has no rights to teach her daughter to be a traditional woman. I calmed her down and apologized saying that it wasn't our intention to interfere with her parenting and that my wife was just trying to do something fun with the kids. But she wasn't ready to listen and my mother joined in saying that she didn't mind my wife being a housewife but my wife shouldn't make the kids be like her(i.e. a housewife). She said that they were trying to make the kids be successful and my wife was trying to do the opposite. My wife started to cry and ran out of the house to the car. I told my mother that I wouldn't be crossing her doorstep again until she apologizes to my wife. Then I left  their house immediately with my daughter. \n\nI've been getting messages from my dad saying that I  should go back home. I haven't replied to him. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685877458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1409yfj/aita_i_told_my_mom_to_apologize_to_my_wife/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nothing is wrong about being a SAHM!\n\nETA: the only reason gender roles are being rejected is because they were forced, the roles themselves aren't a problem, so if a family sees that those roles fits them best and they agree to them there shouldn't be a problem anymore. Your mom and sister need to be taught that", "NTA and good for you for having your wife\u2019s back and supporting her.  Your mom and SIL are straight up snobs.  Being independent woman means you can make a choice and that is what your wife has done by deciding to be a SAHM.

Continue to protect your wife from their snobbery and narrow mindedness.", "NTA\ncooking is a basic life skill for every human being be it a man or a woman. just like doing laundry and cleaning. I' m a career woman, and have a good career and salary, but I love cooking and baking. whenever I have free time, I will bake cookies and cakes\n\nI remember when my place was hit by a floods at the beginning of 2016. the water level is higher than most people home. thank god we live in a higher place so we could still live in our home. but we cant go anywhere else. there's no restaurant that open for food delivery. the only thing we could do is cooking our on food with any food supply we have at home. the flood lasted for more than a week.just imagine if none of us can cook, we could probably die of hunger/ food poising by eating non-edible homemade food", "NTA. Oh for fucks sake. So what, do they think, if you grow up and become a lawyer or a surgeon that you don\u2019t need to know how to bake or cook? Those are life skills that everyone should know basics about. I don\u2019t think for a minute your wife was trying to get those kids to be housewife\u2019s, it is just fun to bake. I\u2019m thankful your wife has you to support her. I mean, I feel like sometimes we are damned if we do and damned if we don\u2019t. If we are SAHM, we get blasted, if we have a job outside the home, we get blasted.

They've taken the stance of labelling some women as \"lesser\" instead of celebrating that all women have a right to *choose* their path in life - and your wife is living as she chooses. Instead of empowering women, they've become part of the problem that has held women back for so long.\n\nNTA, OP. Stand your ground, stand by your wife and support her and your daughter's choices.

I expect some people will say it was a bit harsh what you said to your mother, but at least you told her straight now! Sounds like you, your wife, and your daughter have a much healthier understanding how life is, how it\u2019s okay to do things that don\u2019t fit into other people\u2019s moulds, how it\u2019s okay to take on different roles in a marriage because we\u2019re not all superhuman and can\u2019t have everything we want.", "NTA - cooking is an essential skill, and it can be a fun activity for children, plus giving them fun, quality time with parents/family members.

Or do they just hire someone to do it for them? NTA", "Nta. Baking is not for any particular gender.

NTA !\nYour family is tho!\nBaking cookies (cakes, cupcakes etc) with the kids is an age old, time honored fun past time, and in some countries, a tradition. \nIt has nothing to do with undermining any other education, nor does it turn a child into a homemaker (which is not a bad thing to be! )\n\nYour wife didn\u2019t do it maliciously and the way your family treats her for not having a high powered executive job is disgusting, tbh\n\nYou would think your parents would be proud that their son is a heart surgeon and makes enough to provide a great lifestyle for his family so his wife doesn\u2019t have to work and can stay home with the kids. \n\nStand your ground, OP because you are right - your family needs to apologize to your wife AND they need an AITA-titude Adjustment BIG time", "NTA please tell your wife their are people / other women who respect SAHM it can be very rewarding. \nIt can also be difficult.

I donated cakes etc to local fundraisers- my kids were proud! I did this and still was able to be a professional.

All it does is create a nice memory.\n\nI honestly feel sorry for your niece. Putting her into different activities and tutoring her is all fine and good, but what if one day she decides she does not want to have the kind of career her mother envisions for her? Will she be belittled like your wife? Or worse, will she pursue something she does not want, just to please her mom and grandmom and then end up depressed because she never had the freedom to figure out what she wants in life?\n\nPlease tell your wife she is not doing anything wrong. By letting your own daughter pursue her interests and just be a child, you are doing her a huge favor. I am saying this as a teacher who has seen many teenagers suffer from burn-out and depression. The most important thing for a child is to be happy and feel loved. The confidence she is gaining by knowing she is okay just the way she is will help her be successful in the life she chooses for herself.", "NTA - a kid learning a necessary life skill has nothing to do with her future in college or career.
