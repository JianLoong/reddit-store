She has an almost 5 year old son who is not my child. We broke up because I suspected for months that she was sleeping with her friend Jace.

What ended the relationship was how she would run to him with everything and how she treated him more like a significant other than she did me. Even during her pregnancy with our son (and DNA proved he is my child) she was treating Jace more like the father than me. I tried to make it work but after our son was born I'd had enough and I broke up with her and filed for shared custody, which I was awarded. Our son wasn't even a month old at the time.

What backed this up was my ex had mentioned Jace had a daughter or more than one maybe that he had nothing to do with. Her son was born and she requested that I take a DNA test that proved I was not the father.

In fact, keep those messages in a folder just in case. If she can prove that you took on a fatherly role for the second one, she could try file for support anyway. Not saying she would succeed, but this stuff can always be determined by one missed court date. Never sign anything either! Not for school, benefits, nothing. You need to focus on your son only and I am sorry about the second child, but taking your son gives her more time with her second son. Not saying it makes up for no father, but she chose this.", "NTA and please don't let her guilt you into caring for her affair child. It's a dangerous slippery slope. The more you do, the more you'll be expected to do.", "NTA. \n\nThat younger kid is not your responsibility. That's plain and simple. However, remember that kid's parentage is not the kid's fault. Inviting him to a sleepover with his brother and the friend now and then wouldn't be so bad, would it?", "NTA. If your son desperately wanted his half brother with him for some occasions then I would say suck it up occasionally for his sake. But given he doesn\u2019t, then you are not responsible for someone else\u2019s kid.", "NTA. Seems like she tried to baby trap a deadbeat dad and failed? Well. It sucks for the kid but that's her problem to deal with and I don't think you have to make an extra effort just because your slimy ex wants you too", "NTA not your kid not your problem. The only thing I wonder\u2026 have you asked your son if he wants his brother to attend said sleepover? If your son wants him there then I don\u2019t see the harm in having him come but if he doesn\u2019t you should hold your ground. Either way your exs feelings about the situation are irrelevant. If she wants her younger son to have a father she can hound his biological father not you. I see nothing wrong with what you did.", "NTA. I think you handled that perfectly!", "She's the one who hurt her son by sleeping with a deadbeat. I understand her concern about the hurt her son is feeling by being left by his dad, but she's angry at the wrong person. She should find a father figure that isn't you.", "You\u2019re a legend OP. Keep being a good dad to your boy, and have the least interaction with your ex as possible.\n\nNTA", "NTA you can't be expected to be her other sons father because Jace pulled a disappearing act. You take care of your own son which is more than most guys do. Well done OP. \n\nJace should be held accountable and at least pay child support for his kid. As for your ex...she needs to remain faithful to a guy and maybe find a person willing to be a father.", "NTA. Boundaries are not your existence strong suit.", "NTA by a long shot, but I can't help but to feel sorry for the little boy. Of course he isn't your responsibility and you are very smart to stay away. If you help out in any way, she can take you to court claiming you've accepted responsibility for the kid and are likely to be on the hook for maintenance.", "Bahaha bahahahaha \ud83d\ude02 NTA", "NTA. \n\nAt the end of the day, your ex treated you horribly and you are not required to care for a child that isn't yours.\n\nNgl though my soft ass would probably take the other kid though just because I hate the thought of AHs like your ex caring for any child.\n\nBut that's not to shame you lol. You're definitely not obligated. It's just really sad for the kid man. Your ex sounds like she's the worst.", "NTA. I'm not here to judge you or your ex, but I think you have the right to decide who you want to be a father to. You are not obligated to take on her younger son, especially if he has a biological father who should be responsible for him. You are already doing your best to be a good dad to your own son, and that's commendable.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your kid, and your ex and relationship sounds full of drama", "Bot post", "NTA.

As of now I don't play any role. I don't even see him really. A sleepover would change that. If my son wanted him around I'd do it. But without that? I really don't want him to grow attached to me as the only adult male figure in his life or have him confuse me as his dad as well.", "I'm not even sure if she tried to trap him. I could see it being something they were both reckless with (knowing how they were together) and then reality hit when she realized he wasn't going to do better by her kid than he did with the other(s).", "I have not asked this time. But my son has been kind of clear before about not wanting to have him sleep at our home. His mom has brought this up around him and he thinks it would be a bad idea. He also specifically asked for this to be a sleepover with his best friend only. He'll only get to do that at our home so he's excited about that.", "Totally agree.  Thank you for stepping up and being a constant presence in your child\u2019s life.  I think your ex is realizing that she completely messed up.  Your a keeper.", "She was dating a guy last year (or maybe in 2021 I forget). Not sure what happened to him but I heard people say he ran once she told him she had two kids.", "I think what sucks the most for him is the fact she knows he has a biological father and instead of chasing that dude, she's chasing after me, who is not his dad, and leaving her son in limbo with it all.\n\nThere is that and then of course there is the risk of her dumping him on me and running like Jace seems to have done. Then I'd be left raising a child who is not mine and not even getting anything from her.", "I think in other circumstances my heart might have been soft like that and I would have just said I'll take the other kid on too. But even when he was just born and I had to take the DNA test, I always knew if the results came back that he wasn't mine, like I figured they would, I would not sign myself up to be his dad as well.\n\nI hope if she is actually struggling that she does at least try to chase after the father. Jace or whoever he is. Her kid doesn't deserve to be waiting forever for a better life because she's too busy trying to get me to claim him.", "It would be, if it weren\u2019t about a small child who\u2019s ACTUAL dad wants nothing to do with.", "Yea, if your kid doesn't want it, don't do it.", "That makes sense. And your ex really should respect your boundaries more. It's terrible that people like Jace exist in this world, and I think you did your ex a favor by sending her a picture of Jace and the family law attorney contact info. She should be going after his involvement, not yours.", "Good to hear your taking your sons wishes into account!", "In my experience, it isn't the number of kids, but the number different dad's and if they were ever married.  Like one kid with one guy is usually forgivable as a \"oops\" but 2 by 2 guys so close together, neither married to the lady... ummm, nope.  It kinda screams red flag to some, especially if she brought up that you needed a paternity test, because then it sounds like she was cheating on you.", "Yeah that's completely fair. And it's totally not your problem. It's seriously not me judging. She just sounds like one of those people who should not be allowed to have children which is just an upsetting thing in general. God knows what she's telling this poor child too. I'm so sorry this has even happened in your life at all. Glad you have your son obviously! Kids are the best haha being a parent is amazing. \n\nYeah I completely agree. She needs to sort her sh** out and prioritise his welfare herself and realise it's not your job.\n\nI hope it all settles down soon!", "I hate that parents can walk away from their kids like that. Even though ex was shitty to me and I'm positive she cheated, my son was always going to be my priority and nothing would make me walk away from him or not be his dad.", "I always try to take his wishes into account. I also try to make this two separate households thing easy on him. So I got him a little board for his room that way he can hang photos of whoever he likes and little mementos. I know when your parents are not together it can be hard for kids. So I try to help it not feel so bad. It's rough at times though because I can't do anything about how my ex is."]}
