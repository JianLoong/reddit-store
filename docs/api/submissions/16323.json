Your dad's ego is so fragile hes throwing a tantrum over that fact that people would HYPOTHETICALLY be upset at him for hiding a \"double life\" from his family", "ive actually seen the episode in question..whyis dad being so cagey?DOES he have secret children?", "NTA. If your father doesn't want to know the answer to these kinds of questions, he really shouldn't ask them... \n\nNo apology necessary.", "NTA. You were speaking in hypotheticals and not facts. I find it odd he took it so seriously. Perhaps it was the tone you used? If you think you sounded shitty towards him, you can explain you are sorry for the tone. You are allowed to have an opinion about people having secret families. For that, you did nothing wrong. I wouldn't let this situation sour the relationship you have with your Dad.", "NTA Tell him that if it were to have happened then it would be him with the conditional love as he would have betrayed your mothers love and the family to cheat with someone else. If that\u2019s the kind of person he was then surely he should expect that.  \n\nAs that isn\u2019t the case for him why is he upset, unless he has something he feels guilty about then there shouldn\u2019t be any problems.", "NTA, but this is why I hate, and try not to answer, these dumb hypotheticals. It is almost always a no-win situation.", "OP, You are not the asshole.\n\nOkay, so a lot of these comments seem to have this situation confused. This is a \"What If?\" This \"What If?\" isn't about past relationships and hiding another child from an old relationship. This, is about a man, choosing to cheat and have two separate lives. Two wives, at the same time, lying to each one about where This Unfaithful, lying husband is going, why they are gone so long, staying away from their families and children for long periods of time.\n\nShe's saying if you knowingly had a child, chose to hide them, stay away from them and lie to them, that you are vile. She didn't mean past marriages, relationships, one night stands, she meant current, right now, in the moment \"I have two families.\" This is Gross! sorry.", "NTA and now I'm wondering if he DOES have a child out there. It was a hypothetical question he is taking way too seriously.", "NTA You were speaking hypothetically and even in those hypothetical scenarios your comments were understandable. Your dad's acting kinda sus tho lol", "NTA and tbh his reaction is a little sus.\n\nIt reminds me of a post from not long ago where OPs bf kept asking her if she would support an affair baby, \"hypothetically\" of course.  But eventually admitted to cheating and affair partner is pregnant.", "NTA - it\u2019s a \u201cwhat if\u201d and even if it wasn\u2019t I would say Your dad is the one whose love is conditional. He literally gets upset/hangs up over the tiniest \u201cfake\u201d thing. But you saying you couldn\u2019t forgive a Real betrayal is out of line? \ud83d\ude02 No. \nIf he lied to his family for years and led a completely separate life he obviously doesn\u2019t love either of his families as much as himself. So you can\u2019t ask someone for more than you are willing to give. Right now his love for you is conditional on a \u201cwhat if\u201d situation not going his way. That\u2019s a bit disturbing that he wouldn\u2019t just laugh it off.", "INFO\n\nWhat if he had kids PRIOR to the relationship with your mom? Does it matter if he didn't know the child existed? If you're gonna play around with hypotheticals, you might as well be through about the details.", "NTA It was a hypothetical,  and it's still morally sound. I'd do the same.", "I feel like you have a lot to learn and some maturing to do, but NTA\n\nyou are allowed to have strong conviction in your values and to choose to keep a circle around you that shares your conviction, especially when it comes to honesty and the welfare of children\n\nyour expression of your conviction, however, needs finessing, or be warned that your circle may close quite quickly considering that others may value a more amicable temperament", "NTA, here's a news flash for your dad ALL love is conditional and he shouldn't ask questions if he doesn't want to hear the answer", "NTA but I have to wonder what your dad is not saying based on his response. Most people would just laugh, move on and not think twice about it.", "NTA. It was just a what if, and love usually is conditional, maybe with the exception of some parent\u2019s love for their children.", "NTA   This was a what if scenario. Your dad asked you what you meant pertaining the scenario to him and you told him.", "NTA it was a what if but the fact he is so upset makes me wonder if he does have secret children ?", "NTA. I need more info. I want to watch the episode. What season? Also did they mention how he divorced the wife with out knowing?  I am so sorry for your boyfriends son. \n\nSide note: you realize he has some secrets to react this way.", "NTA one of your parents has another kid or was married before, though", "\"What if I *did* have another child?\" Well, what if grasshoppers had machine guns? Birds sure as shit wouldn't mess with 'em, just like I wouldn't mess with you if you denied/hid the existence of your child.\n\nNTA, your dad seems to be looking for reasons to hurt his own feel bads, if he doesn't have another child y'all don't know about then he has nothing to worry about, you only said you'd cut him off if he did or if he had cheated on your mom, so.", "NTA- your dad probably cheats or cheated  on your mom.", "NTA - it was a hypothetical.\n\nApologize anyway though. \n\nSometimes being offended is about how things are taken, not how they are intended. He's your dad man, swallow this one.", "NTA\n\nIt must be difficult for a dad to realize that he's not infallable in the eyes of his son, but he is not. He needs to deal.", "YTA, your outlook is extremely black and white to the point of absurdity. Yes cheating is bad but someone doesn't lose all value to the world to the point that it would be better if they were dead because they cheated. He made a joke and you went nuclear. If you aren't therapy already I'd highly recommend it.", "If it's just a hypothetical, why are you so hung up on it?\n\nIf your comments have hurt your Dad, why not just apologize and move on? I think your Dad is hurt that everything he's done to raise you, love you, and support you over these last 22 years would be completely gone without any conversation. If I were him, it'd make me question a few things. People are complex creatures and I don't think life is as monochrome as you make it out to be. \n\nSoft YTA", "Of course YTA, you sound psychotic", "ESH.  Your dad overreacted but your comments were extremely cruel. \n\nThere are tons of reasons people may hide their past, and not all of them are because they are cheating or doing something wrong.  I\u2019ve worked with men who have been sexually assaulted and it resulted in pregnancies and children that they never got to meet.  I\u2019ve worked with men who has children very young and the mother\u2019s family cut them off, leaving them no choice.  I\u2019ve worked with men who have had children end up in prison, and they did not want to have contact with them or want to expose their new families to them.  There are so many scenarios in which a person might want to start over.   It\u2019s not ideal for them to hide it, but it\u2019s also understandable.  The world is not black and white.  \n\nNow, if you were referring specifically to a scenario in which your dad cheated or led a second, simultaneous life like in the show, that would be different.  But that\u2019s not what you said to him.  You told him that he would be garbage if he had other children.  \n\nYou owe your dad an apology and a more nuanced conversation about why and how such scenarios would be hurtful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was rooted in my own fear of abandonment and of my perfectionism trying to set up rules by which someone could have a perfect relationship. With therapy I've been able to move on from many of these and with life experience I've been able to see more perspective on why someone would do something like cheat.

To be fair, there are likely familial relationships where this would not be a betrayal. However, in many families, it is. And, personally, it would be far worse than one of my parents cheating."]}
