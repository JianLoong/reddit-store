Two wives, at the same time, lying to each one about where This Unfaithful, lying husband is going, why they are gone so long, staying away from their families and children for long periods of time.\n\nShe's saying if you knowingly had a child, chose to hide them, stay away from them and lie to them, that you are vile. She didn't mean past marriages, relationships, one night stands, she meant current, right now, in the moment \"I have two families.\" This is Gross! sorry.", "NTA and now I'm wondering if he DOES have a child out there.

If you aren't therapy already I'd highly recommend it.", "If it's just a hypothetical, why are you so hung up on it?\n\nIf your comments have hurt your Dad, why not just apologize and move on? I think your Dad is hurt that everything he's done to raise you, love you, and support you over these last 22 years would be completely gone without any conversation.

People are complex creatures and I don't think life is as monochrome as you make it out to be. \n\nSoft YTA", "Of course YTA, you sound psychotic", "ESH.  Your dad overreacted but your comments were extremely cruel. \n\nThere are tons of reasons people may hide their past, and not all of them are because they are cheating or doing something wrong.  I\u2019ve worked with men who have been sexually assaulted and it resulted in pregnancies and children that they never got to meet.  I\u2019ve worked with men who has children very young and the mother\u2019s family cut them off, leaving them no choice.  I\u2019ve worked with men who have had children end up in prison, and they did not want to have contact with them or want to expose their new families to them.  There are so many scenarios in which a person might want to start over.   It\u2019s not ideal for them to hide it, but it\u2019s also understandable.  The world is not black and white.  \n\nNow, if you were referring specifically to a scenario in which your dad cheated or led a second, simultaneous life like in the show, that would be different.  But that\u2019s not what you said to him.  You told him that he would be garbage if he had other children.  \n\nYou owe your dad an apology and a more nuanced conversation about why and how such scenarios would be hurtful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
