If we were a preemie, had to be given drugs for our lungs to develop, and our parents (and others) smoked while pregnant and throughout all of our childhood...\n\nHow fucked are my lungs? \n\nWhat if we also have had pneumonia as a kid and COVID several times despite being up to date on vaccines? XD", "I have no awards but would upvote this a million times if I could. As one of these statistics I can say you never forget who exposed you to cigarette smoke as a kid and wonder if they\u2019re the reason you have asthma for the rest of your life.", "I grew up in a home where both parents smoked constantly. I had horrible asthma and allergies. Until I moved to college. And all of a sudden I was able to play sports for the first time and breathe normally. Absolutely die on this hill.", "> third hand smoke\n\nWow TIL\n\nI knew it couldn't be healthy but didn't know it had a name and had been studied so much.", "I absolutely did die on this hill and my MIL still hates me for it. Never mind that my kid still has pulmonary issues 20+ years later. NTA", "My mom cut back to a pack a day when she was pregnant with my sister and I (it was the 80s), and, of course, we grew up in a smoky home. My sister is a severe asthmatic who nearly died as a kid; I have and always will blame my mother for it.", "I\u2019m a boomer and highly dislike smoking anyway, so this was never an issue in my life. The fact that a smoker is dangerous to a baby because of what\u2019s clinging to their clothing, even when they\u2019re not actively smoking, is a fairly new concept to me - I only heard about it a couple of years ago. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s common knowledge for us older people. NTA", "The news has been talking about second hand smoke for at least 30 years. Unless she lives under a rock, there's just no way she doesn't know exactly why OP is asking for what she is.", "My 32 week preemie is about to turn 18. Same. If the entire family catches a cold, the rest of us will have mild symptoms and he'll be in bed for a week. And we aren't and never have been around smokers.", "Yep. Same. My mother smokes even with me having asthma. One hand putting doing my breathing treatment, the other holding a cigarette. I always had major pulmonary and ENT problems. But smoking trumps having a healthy child. She even smoked whilst pregnant with me.", "Positive spin? You know a weak spot in your armor. Get your physical every year (free under most insurance), be honest and clear about your history (take time with the forms. Find out what you don\u2019t know about other family history. [You can see sample questionnaires here.](https://printabletemplates.com/medical/patient-registration-form/). Keep your own copies. \n\nLive your life. Do whatever you want. But stay ahead and give yourself an advantage.", "Second hand smoke yes, and I would hope she would know not to actually smoke around the baby. This is third hand smoke, not as well understood. I don\u2019t think smokers know their clothes stink, much less that the smell is due to hazardous particles. \n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/third-hand-smoke/faq-20057791", "Haha! Thankfully, I just had a physical and aside from being overweight (working on it - my thyroid went haywire for a while) and seeing a surgeon soon for a nerve issue I'm good."]}
