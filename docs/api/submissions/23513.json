Move your AC unit back to your bedroom, use your fans where and when you need to, keep your TV to normal limits and tell the neighbor to stop the harassment, or better yet, have the landlord tell them. Call your landlord so your landlord knows what's going on and have them deal with your completely unreasonable neighbor. If your neighbor is so noise sensitive he can invest in some noise canceling headphones. You also might want to invest in a security system in case your neighbor decides to escalate things.", "NTA you live in apartments and will always hear some noise from the neighbors. You\u2019re not blasting music and I highly doubt any of the noise is above the threshold to be considered a nuisance. He can go buy some earplugs. But yes letting the LL know is the best action here. Good luck!", "NTA, if his hearing is that sensitive he needs some earplugs or noise canceling headphones", "NTA. Stop answering the doors and stop doing whatever he wants. He lives in AN APARTMENT BUILDING. He needs to learn to deal with noises. Talk to your landlord and keep doing you.", "NTA\n\nTalk to the landlord, document every instance of the neighbor doing this (including what levels your TV was at, time of day, etc). Keep all the notes. \n\nIt's an apartment. Can't expect it to be completely quiet, and \\*definitely\\* can't expect neighbors to adjust their behaviour because HE start taking something that \"increases your hearing\".", "NTA\n\nI had the misfortune of apartment life in my younger years.  \"Reasonable\" noise is something that goes with that existence.  Loud and unreasonable noise can make life unbearable.  Nobody could possibly say that your noise is other than typical and completely acceptable.  You acted appropriately dealing with the landlord, and furthermore should tell the neighbor where to stick it sideways if he continues to harass you.", "NTA. I've had to take the stance that literally anything outside of city ordinance is harassment, to whatever degree the neighbors do it. I lived at an apartment complex like this with 32 noise complaints from the same lady who expected silence during daytime hours.", "NTA. The law in our country is that you are entitled to reasonable enjoyment of your own apartment, and reasonable noise between 7am and 11.30pm is protected. I would suspect your laws are similar? Trying to interfere with your use of air conditioning is obviously against that. I had a neighbour\u2019s tenant complain repeatedly over nothing, and I wrote to their landlord saying that I was trying to get on out of general agreeableness, but they were pushing it too far. He turned them out. Please do tell the landlord that the neighbours are nutjobs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Me, I work weird hours and sleep weird hours, and couldn't function without them, because my neighbors aren't going to stop living their lives for my schedule.", "NTA\n\nThis is an insane level of noise policing verging on harassment. I have worked nights while living in an apartment before. Your neighbor needs to figure out what he needs to do to mitigate noise. For me, it was a white noise machine. Noise during the day is absolutely normal. You aren't throwing a rager. Going to the landlord first is an excellent idea because your space is becoming unliveable due to harassment from your neighbor and will help if your neighbor starts making outlandish claims. Furthermore, move your AC back where you want it. \n\nNext time your neighbor complains to you, be frank: your AC is not turning off when it's hot out. He needs to figure something out for himself. You will respect quiet hours in the building, but not live silently. Your neighbor is harassing you and needs to sort out his sleep problems himself and stop making it your problem.", "NTA If wants silence he should buy a house. He should be wearing ear plugs or have white noise running in the bedroom. Get ahead of this and talk to the LL", "You have the right to make noise during day light  in most areas.
