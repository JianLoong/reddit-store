Is he involved with drugs ?", "NTA\n\nWhat? Just\u2026. What? \n\nThat\u2019s some creepy controlling crap right there. Lots of people shower before bed. My teenage son showers before bed. I don\u2019t care when he showers, as long as he showers. During school nights he has bedtime, because he has a hard time staying on track for school otherwise. But I would NEVER turn the hot water off on him for any reason. That\u2019s soooo mean.  \n\nI have some serious concerns about how your dad treats you kids. That isn\u2019t normal. I suggest talking to a school counselor.", "Your Dad is a control freak bully.  17 and in bed by 9?  Fucks sake.", "Clealry NTA\n\nYou dad is a huge one though in addition to being abusive and controlling. Please report this to authorities or reach out to any caring adults at your school - maybe a teacher or counselor.", "NTA. Why should you be in your room by 9? You're 17. That's abnormal.", " Nta and that rule is tyrannical", "NTA. Start a countdown app for the number of days until you turn 18. Gather your personal documents. Store them at a trusted friend's house if possible. Your dad is an abusive AH.", "Sorry you have a crazy dad. I do too.  What you have to understand is that this is all about control.  He sets up rules that are nearly impossible to follow but not completely impossible so he has a way to justify it.  When you follow the rules, he suddenly has no leverage over you and starts bending his own rules to be stricter just to watch you break them so he now has a reason to control you even more.  You follow the rules again and he'll add more.  It's a never ending cycle where the only winner is him. There is no sense or logic besides him wanting control over your behavior and your emotions. Please get out of there when you are able and never look back. Don't fall for the emotional and/or financial manipulation that he will inevitably use to gain back control once you leave.", "Wow, 9 pm lockdown starts. Guess a new A hole rule? No shower after such and such a time. I think your dad is mean spirited. He wanted you upset. And you delivered.

If he caught us using the restroom after we (my two older brothers and I (F)) went to bed, we would get yelled at. \n\nMy father used to abuse me at night. \n\nGet all of your important documents and keep them safe. Get out of there ASAP and stay safe, OP.", "NTA.\n\nI also doubt this is the only stupid rule and abusive behavior that your Dad has. Leave the house and don't look back", "You are 17 and should be more independent...and that includes not having to be in your room at 9pm. NTA. Say adios once you can.", "WTF is up with your dad and his rules? You are prohibited from leaving your bedroom after 9:00 p.m.? \nHaving said this, ultimately it's his house and he can make whatever rules he wants, as long is he is not being abusive or doing anything legal of course.
