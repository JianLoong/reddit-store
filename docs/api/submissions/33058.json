The biggest problem we've had so far is arguments about cooking. \n\nHe lived off of ramen and sandwiches before moving in, so he says I'm the one who cares about food (note that he happily eats what I cook, suggest recipes to try, and hasn't had any ramen since moving in, even though I bought it for him he chooses the food I make) so since I'm \"cooking for myself\" anyways I might as well cook for him too. \n\nI told him that isn't fair, either he needs to pick up more chores to compensate for never cooking, or he needs to cook ~3 days a week. He said he didn't care about food, so he shouldn't have to cook, I'm just doing it for myself. \n\nSo I only cooked for myself. I got him a pack of ramen (even got his preferred brand) and only made portions for one. He was pretty pissed when I made myself risotto and he got a bowl of ramen, and I reminded him he doesn't care about food. \n\nAITA here? I don't mean to be difficult, but I don't think expecting me to cook all the time is fair. After several conversations about this that lead nowhere I figured I should call his bluff. We pay bills 50/50 if that matters. \n\nIt's been about a week, he's angry and told me it's no more effort for me to cook for 2 than for 1, but it's about the principle.\n\nI have college full time and work part time, he works full time. \n\nRight now the chore split is about 60/40 on good days, with me doing 60%. This is excluding cooking. \n\nHE DOESN'T HAVE TO COOK. I just want cooking to \"count\" a chore so he'll compensate with doing something else. He argues that it's not a chore because I 'do it for myself anyways'. \n\nEDITED TO ADD THE CURRENT DEVISION OF CHORES: \n\nRight now we each do our own laundry and take turns doing dishes.\n\nI deep clean the kitchen and bathroom every two weeks, and he vacuums once a week and mops every two weeks.

Which is totally unfair.\n\nThis is assuming he's not making up for it by doing other chores. Maybe tell him you'll cook if he always does the dishes/cleanup himself?", "NTA. He's trying to pretend he doesn't care, but as soon as it inconveniences him he cares all of a sudden.  Clearly he does want you to cook for him and he values your cooking.  So what does he get.out of pretending he doesn't care?  It's just a way to devalue your labor so he doesn't feel obliged to contribute himself", "NTA and I think your math is a little off given your description - he's not doing almost half the chores even without cooking. You realize his expecting you to do most of the house chores is only going to get worse, right? \n\nOf course cooking counts as a chore. I hope you're not preparing his ramen for him, too.", "NTA\n\nPerhaps instead of taking turns doing the dishes, you could do the cooking and he can do all the dishes. - They are both daily chores and are kinda related so fairness is more or less baked in.\n\nHis argument that you are 'cooking for yourself anyway' isn't a good one really. If it stands, then his once a week vacuuming is for himself as well and shouldn't count. \n\nIf y'all want to work on this without the hurt feelings and the passive aggressive arguments, you might want to check out [https://www.fairplaylife.com/](https://www.fairplaylife.com/)", "NTA\n\nIf the workload is not balanced, you are right to call him on his bullshit.", "He\u2019s a baby. Date an adult.", "NTA you are another example of my men in relationships live lnger and better lifes and womens life gets worse and the extra stress will not add some years in your life neither.\n\nMove out untill he is a man you would like to live with, or get someone else.\n\nRight now a roommate would be a nicer partner to live with.", "NTA  \nyour boyfriend is exploiting you and using a technicality as an excuse.  \nyes, you already cook for yourself and making more isnt that much more work but you are partners and a partnership where you live together should make both of your lives easier by splitting the stuff that each already has to do in a single household. right now only HE is benefitting from that though.\n\nI dont know why all the other comments are arguing abt exact splitting of household chores and the sillyness of your percentages or the maturity of you/your relationship.  \nthe important part here is that your boyfriend is dead weight that is using you while being intellectually dishonest. he is literally lying to your face that he \"doesnt care about food\" in order to never pick up the slack and never take accountability for it.  \neven if it were true (which given your current predicament it evidently is \\*not\\*), he should still show care for YOU! and at least either pick up other household work to ease your workload OR take care of the food situation some times and at least pay for take out for both of you if he is that incompetent at cooking.\n\nIf i were you i would seriously reevaluate this relationship. your partner is lying to you to cheat the system of being there for you back when he benefits form your service to him. and that has nothing to do with being \"tit for tat\", it has to do with treating each other and each others's concerns and wishes with respect and open communication. which you are 100% entitled to expect from your partner, anything less is not an equal relationship.", "Girl, him vacuuming and mopping once a week and doing his own laundry while you do _literally everything else_ is not a 60/40 split.\nI actually sat down with my gf to divide chores based on time spent on things per week, and cooking is like half of total time spent on chores.\n\n\nHis argument that cooking shouldn't count as a chore falls apart instantly with one critical thought thrown against it: cook a 2 portion meal for two people and you have to cook again the next day. Cook a 2 portion meal for one person and you only have to cook one day, and you can just reheat the rest the next day.\n\n\nHaving to cook for 2 people instead of one _doubles_ the amount of time you need to spend on cooking.\n\n\nHe is a big dumb dumb.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA, you might want to rethink this relationship.  What other non-chores do you think he'll expect you to do down the line ... when you have kids, buy a house, have friends and family over? This doesn't bode well for the future.\n\nYou're still so young, you can do better.", "NTA and you are totally right to do this. He is dismissing your work and your time and your effort. He is acting as if cooking for him (or mentally thinking about what to cook so he likes it) is nothing. And refusing to take up more chores to compensate for the house work means he is unfair to your home work distribution. It is entirely about principle - the principle is that if you cook for both, he should do something at the house on behalf of both too. And you should totally include the cooking in the house chores. \n\nDon't back down on that or you will end up being the house maid in the relationship. Your time is just as valuable as his and your house is where you both live so you both need to contribute to it.", "NTA. If you do all the cooking now, you will do all of the cooking for your entire relationship. He says he doesn't care about food, but it sounds like he just can't be bothered to make more than instant noodles. You need to make your expectations clear and set boundaries now as you've just moved in together.", "NTA. He can\u2019t get out of accountability for meal prep by saying \u201cI don\u2019t care about food\u201d and then punish you for believing him.", "INFO: does he not do shit? You said you told him he needed to do \u201cmore\u201d just kind of wondering if more starts are 0 or if you feel like you\u2019re not doing comparable amounts of work around the house but he does actually do things?", "NTA, but, dump this boyfriend.  He's a child.  Also, find a significant other that you love to take care of and do things for and who does the same for you.  If you're spending your time worrying if everything is split completely evenly, you're not with the right person.  There will be many times throughout your life with someone where things will not be even or fair because stuff happens in life.  If that's going to be a problem, best to stay single.", "NTA\nBy reading some of your further comments the division of labour isn't even.  Honestly since you both pay 50/50 he is taking advantage, especially since he is saying cooking doesn't count but the thing is you're doing groceries and such on top of this. \nBetter you just sort out your own meals, wash your own dishes and each week the deep clean of the kitchen and bathroom swapped over and each take turns doing the vacuuming and mopping.", "NTA , he wants you to play mommy . If he doesn\u2019t help with cooking and groceries , he can stay without . \n\nIf you continue cooking for him , he\u2019ll always make you do it . It will become the norm . Often selfish people will try and convince you that because you\u2019re doing it for yourself it should be no issue doing it for them . \n\nDon\u2019t let him bully you . He can survive off of ramen the way he\u2019s been doing it .", "NTA\n\nAnd yes, it is more work to cook for two than for one. If you have to prepare the ingridients like cutting veggis etc, doubeling the amount of ingridients nearly doubles the amount of prep work time. \n\nI would continue to only cook for yourself. Cooking doesn't count as a chore? So ok, its your hobby then and he can join you in this hobby if he wants to benefit from it. \n\nIf you give in now, you will end up with a lot of resentements. \n\nIf you take over the chores of a lazy person (and yes, cooking is a chore) to be nice or bc you love them or bc you don't care doing more, you are doing both of you a disfavour. You will build up resentements (bc the appreciation will stop very fast), the lazy person becomes more lazy and more entitled. Being so lazy to a point he would rather eat processed food like ramen for every meal instead of cooking (when he can afford it) is not only impacting himself but also the people around him, especially you. By cooking for him you would only enable his bad habits. I wiuld even go as far as to cook really elaborated meals for myself. The more jealous he gets, the higher the chance he really really wants your cooking back and accept it is in fact a chore. \n\nYou are very young, let a lady a lot older than you (me) tell you this: make sure the chores change to 50/50 fast. If he is only contributing 30-40% already while you pay 50/50, he will reduce his 30% more and more over time and baam, you are living with a moody teenager you have to argue with about every little contribution you want from him. Its easier to put your foot down now, while he is stll used to do at least a third of the chores than wanting to change him when he reaches 0% or 5%. Plus you will resent the hell out of him, so the relationship will most likely fail. Don't spend your time to clean up behind and cooking for a grown ass man who isn't willing to contribute his part. You will regret having wasted your time on this. If he doesn't want to contribute 50%, then he is only in the relationship for having an easy life and not bc of you as a person. \n\nLet him be mad, enjoy your meals around him, either he leaves you (and then you know for sure he was only with you bc he thought he can take advantage of you and you are dumb enough to play along) or he will come around, realises he is acting lazy and entitled and you are his gf, not his mom and offers you to take over a part of your chores, if you cook for both of you. Or you can discuss another solution like him paying 70% of the expenses and you doing 70% of the chores if you want to (so just the 60% you are already doing and adding the cooking). But this relationship will only work in the long run, if its fair. \n\n\nIts a sad fact that a lot of ppl think as long they contribut 50% moneywise, it doesn't matter if they don't contribute 50% in chores", "NTA. \n\nHis logic is \n- i can't be arsed to cook for me or you\n- but you can be arsed to cook for you\n- so you should cook for me as well because i want nice food\n\nThis argument is based on the premise that he can't be arsed to cook for you. The conclusion of that thinking is that you have a duty to him, but he has no duty to you.\n\nNOPE. He's a lazy ass who needs a mommy to make sure he eats his veggies.", "NTA Why does he get to decide that you will be cook and he can just sit back and enjoy. Its not at all true he does not care about food, its that he does not care about what YOU have to eat. Its weaponized incompetence. A 12 year old can make simple dishes like pasta, omelettes, grilled or baked protein plus veg. You could show him a few dishes, work together on cooking make it fun and sensual. If he is open to that it may remove this unhealthy battle vibe from what should be a happy topic. But he cannot lie and say he does not care about food yet freak out you eat better than him. If he expects a trad wife he should come out and admit it.", "NTA. If you asked him to cook in order to split the chores more evenly and his stance is to say no and tell you that he doesn't care for food then he can have his ramen.", "NTA. There are so many ways he can step up with other chores, he is just not willing to.", "My ex husband was lucky if he could put cereal in a bowl and pour milk on it. It was really frustrating to be in charge of meals everyday especially the time I was puking and he still had the nerve to ask what was for dinner. He was also psychologically abusive so I left. My now husband cooks without any issue. I\u2019m a SAHM of 3 and he works so I do most of the cooking. He enjoys grilling so if we have burgers or steak he cooks. He never bats an eye when I meal plan and it\u2019s a meal he likes to cook. I don\u2019t have to ask he just does it. I also try and plan these meals on weekends when he has more time. If you think someone not contributing to cooking is going to be a problem then better to let them know now or get out before further commitment is made. Also I like your pettiness because to me it\u2019s exactly what I would have done.

Right now he doesn\u2019t even do the washing up after she cooked. \n\nThis isn\u2019t 1950\u2019s and before anyone start coming up with crap like \u201cthis is what feminism has done - making women so petty, and not wanting to cook for their partner\u201d, household chores are work, and if two people live in the same fucking place, then both should do the chores equally.  If one cook daily, then the partner will do the washing up and clean countertop/stove afterward.  Likewise with all the other chores, she change the duvet cover/sheet weekly, he take out the trash and hoover weekly.", "This sounds like a really good way to split chores. I like it.", "My uni housemates and I did this! We would cook for ourselves too, but because I enjoy cooking and they all loved my food (and I hate doing the dishes lol) I would regularly cook group meals and they\u2019d all clean up afterwards. It worked great because everyone got a nice healthy meal, and they didn\u2019t mind dealing with all the gross bits in the sink! Win win!\n\nThat being said, if I was still expected to clean afterwards, I wouldn\u2019t have cooked for everyone as much as I did. It\u2019s about give and take, and just because someone is giving it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t give in return.", "Same! Although my husband has been doing the dishes more frequently after he cooks because pregnancy f-ed my back up and he knows it hurts if I stand hunched at the sink too long.", "The \"cooks don't clean\" thing led to one of the funnier unintentional benefits in my house. My partner and I both enjoy cooking and will often make a meal together, then have a \"fight\" over who \"gets to\" do the dishes. Well, the kids picked up on this and started being the judges over who is allowed to do the dishes on a given night, then they started trying to get to the sink before we could. Our eight year old laughed at us because he \"got\" to do the dishes just the other night.\n\nI suppose I should be grateful, but to be honest I was a bit miffed - it was clearly my turn!", "Same here. My girlfriend is a great cook, while I consider it literally a chore. So she cooks, I clean up after - load the dishwasher, wash the pots and pans, clean the kitchen.

Shitty, lazy men, not so much.", "We will.", "Lmao self burn, those are rare.\nWomen prefer cats than putting up with you, how sad and pathetic", "Living with a cat >> living with a man who acts like a child. It's pretty fun to see some men scared enough by that, trying to turn the tables to make it look like women are the losers.", "Oh honey. You really thought you did something there. Adorable.", "A cat is a much better roommate than a man that treats his girlfriend like his mommy.", "ask urself why women prefer being alone than spending their lives with lazy men", "Lmfao a cat treats you better than men like this. Funnily enough, y'all need to realize that this is not a threat or a downside. Men like you are the shit end of the stick.", "unfortunately the best strategy I know is to stop doing his chores all together (granted he knows those are specifically his, but I hate this notion that one cannot simply look around and not know what needs to be done). it might get worse before it get's better. Or it might clear up his intention about maintaining HIS shared living space when he can push of responsibility to someone else - then you'll know exactly who you're dealing with.", "Does he bring anything to the relationship apart from aggro and more chores for you? NTA", "[deleted]", "From your edit, he vacuums once a week and mops twice a month. And you do ALL of the other collective chores? All of the cooking, all of the other cleaning, the grocery shopping, the trash?\n\nDear that's not a 60/40 split, that's like a 95/5 split. \n\nIn addition, he is working one job while you are in effect working 1.5 jobs.\n\nWhat does he do with all his free time??", "NTA - your hours of school/work are the same.  If he wants you to do all the cooking/kitchen work then he needs to take up the slack in other areas!!!  \n\nPlease show him this comment.  He is acting like a spoiled child and needs to grow up and be a full partner.", "He wasn\u2019t understanding the words, so you had to actually demonstrate it. This is barely petty considering you even went to the trouble of making his ramen.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Don't listen to comments saying you are the one nit-picking, OP. He is the one who began this whole thing by essentially trying to shirk his way out of a fair share of house chores by claiming that what you do doesn't count.", "No don\u2019t listen to this guy, you\u2019re NTA \n\nYour BF doesn\u2019t want to cook (and it sounds like he also doesn\u2019t want to do other chores either)\nYou\u2019re not happy with the division of labour and your brought it up and instead of hearing your complaints he brushed it off and said it was no big deal to cook for 2. \n\nAnd well if it\u2019s really not such a big deal why doesn\u2019t he do it..? \n\nHe sounds extremely lazy and selfish and not ready for a serious relationship.

OKAY-so back to the drawing board in my response. Move out. He is not ready for a long term relationship if he doesn\u2019t understand that he should WANT to contribute towards the relationship. A giving partner does not have to be told to contribute. A giving partner WANTS to contribute to make the other partner happy. A real life, solid partnership (of any kind) will always fit the description of each partner always trying to outdo the other with good deeds. Watch anyone with a solid, happy relationship that has lasted longer than 15 years. That is the secret. Person A does something for person B and person B does something for person A. No one in these scenarios sits down and tallies each others\u2019 contributions or has to be told. Each person just does whatever he/she sees as needed and if they can\u2019t think of something, they ASK each other for what needs to be done.", "There was a post the other day about a bf & gf that took over the last few months of a friends lease.

I was only talking about the actual cooking, and this 5% thing isn\u2019t a finite number. Please don\u2019t take it as a literal calculation. \n\nIn my marriage, I do about 80% of the cooking, 100% of the meal planning, and about 20% of the clean up. My husband does 100% of the shopping, put away, and 80% of the clean up. Plus, we maintain 3 different household diets (1 vegan, 1 pescatarian, 1 eats everything, 2 vegetarians have left the nest). \n\nI own a company that operates 2nd shift (dinner time) so I usually do all the prep I can in the mornings while he works a traditional shift. Then, he does the final touches (baking, salad assembly, etc.) so dinner is on the table for us all when I get home at 8pm. When the kids were home, they contributed too. \n\nI take cooking to actually mean cooking. The side chores that go with it were not what I was talking about, which was the entire point. CHORES should be evenly divided.", "My partner (male) and is an ex chef. Don\u2019t listen to nonsense about men not being able to cook, professional kitchens are male dominated industries. It really sounds like your partner is trying to pull some weaponised incompetence. No one wants to cook every single night, and you are studying and working. Cooking is a basic life skill, for me it is a red flag if any person can\u2019t feed themselves healthy as an adult. Also the other gender role stuff is irrelevant, I\u2019m the one in my relationship that fixes things and owns all the tools. Relationships are balance no one party should be expected to do all of one type of chore all the time, pick up when the other falls behind, try to make each other\u2019s lives easier and you will be happy.", "I don't think that really works as they probably have different standards - my partner gets bothered if the house isn't hoovered for a week, whereas I reckon I could leave it for 2 weeks to a month before it really bothered me, if left to my own devices.

He lives there. All those things they are jointly responsible for. Not just the bills.  Percentages matter when she is already doing 60-70% of tasks and that doesn't include the cooking.
