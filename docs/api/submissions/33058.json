The biggest problem we've had so far is arguments about cooking. \n\nHe lived off of ramen and sandwiches before moving in, so he says I'm the one who cares about food (note that he happily eats what I cook, suggest recipes to try, and hasn't had any ramen since moving in, even though I bought it for him he chooses the food I make) so since I'm \"cooking for myself\" anyways I might as well cook for him too. \n\nI told him that isn't fair, either he needs to pick up more chores to compensate for never cooking, or he needs to cook ~3 days a week. He said he didn't care about food, so he shouldn't have to cook, I'm just doing it for myself. \n\nSo I only cooked for myself. I got him a pack of ramen (even got his preferred brand) and only made portions for one. He was pretty pissed when I made myself risotto and he got a bowl of ramen, and I reminded him he doesn't care about food. \n\nAITA here? I don't mean to be difficult, but I don't think expecting me to cook all the time is fair. After several conversations about this that lead nowhere I figured I should call his bluff. We pay bills 50/50 if that matters. \n\nIt's been about a week, he's angry and told me it's no more effort for me to cook for 2 than for 1, but it's about the principle.\n\nI have college full time and work part time, he works full time. \n\nRight now the chore split is about 60/40 on good days, with me doing 60%. This is excluding cooking. \n\nHE DOESN'T HAVE TO COOK. I just want cooking to \"count\" a chore so he'll compensate with doing something else. He argues that it's not a chore because I 'do it for myself anyways'. \n\nEDITED TO ADD THE CURRENT DEVISION OF CHORES: \n\nRight now we each do our own laundry and take turns doing dishes.\n\nI deep clean the kitchen and bathroom every two weeks, and he vacuums once a week and mops every two weeks.

Which is totally unfair.\n\nThis is assuming he's not making up for it by doing other chores. Maybe tell him you'll cook if he always does the dishes/cleanup himself?", "NTA. He's trying to pretend he doesn't care, but as soon as it inconveniences him he cares all of a sudden.  Clearly he does want you to cook for him and he values your cooking.  So what does he get.out of pretending he doesn't care?  It's just a way to devalue your labor so he doesn't feel obliged to contribute himself", "NTA and I think your math is a little off given your description - he's not doing almost half the chores even without cooking. You realize his expecting you to do most of the house chores is only going to get worse, right? \n\nOf course cooking counts as a chore. I hope you're not preparing his ramen for him, too.", "NTA\n\nPerhaps instead of taking turns doing the dishes, you could do the cooking and he can do all the dishes. - They are both daily chores and are kinda related so fairness is more or less baked in.\n\nHis argument that you are 'cooking for yourself anyway' isn't a good one really. If it stands, then his once a week vacuuming is for himself as well and shouldn't count. \n\nIf y'all want to work on this without the hurt feelings and the passive aggressive arguments, you might want to check out [https://www.fairplaylife.com/](https://www.fairplaylife.com/)", "NTA\n\nIf the workload is not balanced, you are right to call him on his bullshit.", "He\u2019s a baby.

Cook a 2 portion meal for one person and you only have to cook one day, and you can just reheat the rest the next day.\n\n\nHaving to cook for 2 people instead of one _doubles_ the amount of time you need to spend on cooking.\n\n\nHe is a big dumb dumb.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA, you might want to rethink this relationship.  What other non-chores do you think he'll expect you to do down the line ... when you have kids, buy a house, have friends and family over? This doesn't bode well for the future.\n\nYou're still so young, you can do better.", "NTA and you are totally right to do this. He is dismissing your work and your time and your effort. He is acting as if cooking for him (or mentally thinking about what to cook so he likes it) is nothing. And refusing to take up more chores to compensate for the house work means he is unfair to your home work distribution. It is entirely about principle - the principle is that if you cook for both, he should do something at the house on behalf of both too. And you should totally include the cooking in the house chores. \n\nDon't back down on that or you will end up being the house maid in the relationship. Your time is just as valuable as his and your house is where you both live so you both need to contribute to it.", "NTA. If you do all the cooking now, you will do all of the cooking for your entire relationship. He says he doesn't care about food, but it sounds like he just can't be bothered to make more than instant noodles. You need to make your expectations clear and set boundaries now as you've just moved in together.", "NTA. He can\u2019t get out of accountability for meal prep by saying \u201cI don\u2019t care about food\u201d and then punish you for believing him.", "INFO: does he not do shit? You said you told him he needed to do \u201cmore\u201d just kind of wondering if more starts are 0 or if you feel like you\u2019re not doing comparable amounts of work around the house but he does actually do things?", "NTA, but, dump this boyfriend.  He's a child.  Also, find a significant other that you love to take care of and do things for and who does the same for you.  If you're spending your time worrying if everything is split completely evenly, you're not with the right person.  There will be many times throughout your life with someone where things will not be even or fair because stuff happens in life.  If that's going to be a problem, best to stay single.", "NTA\nBy reading some of your further comments the division of labour isn't even.  Honestly since you both pay 50/50 he is taking advantage, especially since he is saying cooking doesn't count but the thing is you're doing groceries and such on top of this. \nBetter you just sort out your own meals, wash your own dishes and each week the deep clean of the kitchen and bathroom swapped over and each take turns doing the vacuuming and mopping.", "NTA , he wants you to play mommy . If he doesn\u2019t help with cooking and groceries , he can stay without . \n\nIf you continue cooking for him , he\u2019ll always make you do it . It will become the norm . Often selfish people will try and convince you that because you\u2019re doing it for yourself it should be no issue doing it for them . \n\nDon\u2019t let him bully you . He can survive off of ramen the way he\u2019s been doing it .", "NTA\n\nAnd yes, it is more work to cook for two than for one. If you have to prepare the ingridients like cutting veggis etc, doubeling the amount of ingridients nearly doubles the amount of prep work time. \n\nI would continue to only cook for yourself. Cooking doesn't count as a chore? So ok, its your hobby then and he can join you in this hobby if he wants to benefit from it. \n\nIf you give in now, you will end up with a lot of resentements. \n\nIf you take over the chores of a lazy person (and yes, cooking is a chore) to be nice or bc you love them or bc you don't care doing more, you are doing both of you a disfavour. You will build up resentements (bc the appreciation will stop very fast), the lazy person becomes more lazy and more entitled. Being so lazy to a point he would rather eat processed food like ramen for every meal instead of cooking (when he can afford it) is not only impacting himself but also the people around him, especially you. By cooking for him you would only enable his bad habits. I wiuld even go as far as to cook really elaborated meals for myself. The more jealous he gets, the higher the chance he really really wants your cooking back and accept it is in fact a chore. \n\nYou are very young, let a lady a lot older than you (me) tell you this: make sure the chores change to 50/50 fast. If he is only contributing 30-40% already while you pay 50/50, he will reduce his 30% more and more over time and baam, you are living with a moody teenager you have to argue with about every little contribution you want from him. Its easier to put your foot down now, while he is stll used to do at least a third of the chores than wanting to change him when he reaches 0% or 5%. Plus you will resent the hell out of him, so the relationship will most likely fail. Don't spend your time to clean up behind and cooking for a grown ass man who isn't willing to contribute his part. You will regret having wasted your time on this. If he doesn't want to contribute 50%, then he is only in the relationship for having an easy life and not bc of you as a person. \n\nLet him be mad, enjoy your meals around him, either he leaves you (and then you know for sure he was only with you bc he thought he can take advantage of you and you are dumb enough to play along) or he will come around, realises he is acting lazy and entitled and you are his gf, not his mom and offers you to take over a part of your chores, if you cook for both of you. Or you can discuss another solution like him paying 70% of the expenses and you doing 70% of the chores if you want to (so just the 60% you are already doing and adding the cooking). But this relationship will only work in the long run, if its fair. \n\n\nIts a sad fact that a lot of ppl think as long they contribut 50% moneywise, it doesn't matter if they don't contribute 50% in chores", "NTA. \n\nHis logic is \n- i can't be arsed to cook for me or you\n- but you can be arsed to cook for you\n- so you should cook for me as well because i want nice food\n\nThis argument is based on the premise that he can't be arsed to cook for you. The conclusion of that thinking is that you have a duty to him, but he has no duty to you.\n\nNOPE. He's a lazy ass who needs a mommy to make sure he eats his veggies.", "NTA Why does he get to decide that you will be cook and he can just sit back and enjoy. Its not at all true he does not care about food, its that he does not care about what YOU have to eat. Its weaponized incompetence. A 12 year old can make simple dishes like pasta, omelettes, grilled or baked protein plus veg. You could show him a few dishes, work together on cooking make it fun and sensual. If he is open to that it may remove this unhealthy battle vibe from what should be a happy topic. But he cannot lie and say he does not care about food yet freak out you eat better than him. If he expects a trad wife he should come out and admit it.", "NTA. If you asked him to cook in order to split the chores more evenly and his stance is to say no and tell you that he doesn't care for food then he can have his ramen.", "NTA. There are so many ways he can step up with other chores, he is just not willing to.", "My ex husband was lucky if he could put cereal in a bowl and pour milk on it. It was really frustrating to be in charge of meals everyday especially the time I was puking and he still had the nerve to ask what was for dinner. He was also psychologically abusive so I left. My now husband cooks without any issue. I\u2019m a SAHM of 3 and he works so I do most of the cooking. He enjoys grilling so if we have burgers or steak he cooks. He never bats an eye when I meal plan and it\u2019s a meal he likes to cook. I don\u2019t have to ask he just does it. I also try and plan these meals on weekends when he has more time. If you think someone not contributing to cooking is going to be a problem then better to let them know now or get out before further commitment is made. Also I like your pettiness because to me it\u2019s exactly what I would have done.

People only have to worry about cooking for themselves, cleaning for themselves, vacuuming when the mess bothers their own sensibilities and not those of anybody else.   \n  You don't really have to consider anybody else's feelings, and that's a lot less stressful than having to face the fact that relationships come with annoying obligations, as well as all the good stuff. \n\nYour point of view is fair, and yes, cooking is a chore. Saying \"well, you were making it anyway, so why shouldn't I have some too?\" is, whether he realises it or not, ungrateful and a rather immature way of seeing things. It's the way kids view their mother's cooking, and it overlooks the fact that you've had to think about how to make enough for two people, consider whether he'd like it, decide that you want to do it in order to care for him by providing food, and then make sure it's done right. Cooking for someone is both a physical act of caring for their welfare, and caring about their emotional needs and happiness. \n\n  I went through exactly the same attitude from my partner, and things became quite heated, with my efforts being treated as so disposable and taken-for-granted that meals I cooked for both of us to share were often left going cold for 30-45 mins while I sat at the table waiting, with them getting angry if I dared to 'rush them' to finish gaming or web-browsing.   \nGently pointing out that they were taking me for granted and being selfish and rude resulted in explosive outbursts of self-justification and dismissal from them, and only a few fairly explosive rows where I pointed out a few home truths about their behaviour finally turned things around. \n\nIf you address this early, hopefully you'll be able to avoid reaching such a stalemate. Try having a conversation or two where you explain that you understand that you're both very new to having to share space with a partner, and that you know all chores - including cooking - are a pain in the neck, but that couples that care about each other only get stronger and stronger; - and that you'd love them to meet you halfway with bits and pieces around the home. That cooking isn't easy for you - it's sometimes a real pain in the a\\*\\*, but that you include them because you care about them.   \nThat you know they're trying and that it's great to see, and you're struggling too so would love them to help you with X, Y and Z here and there. \n\nI suggest this method, because I found that chores lists don't work (they often devolve into a blame-game, and they can feel like something a parent would do to a child, which makes some people want to rebel against them on principle). Empathy, and invoking their instinct to care about you as their partner was what worked for us, and has resulted in a much healthier and more appreciative sharing of tasks.

It doesn\u2019t get done as often as id like but it gets done. He also helps with my laundry but doesn\u2019t do it all start to finish (ie I sort it and put it away, he brings it down to wash and dry). \nAs far as getting my BF to cook, after 4 years living together he still doesn\u2019t and I\u2019ve accepted that I\u2019m the cook and that\u2019s ok cuz my food slaps, I like cooking and it\u2019s my mindfulness time. \nIt definitely sounds like the two of you need to revisit your chore split. One piece of advice I\u2019d gotten was to look at how long each chore takes and factor in time spent doing chores vs just 3 chores for you, 4 chores for me. Discuss which chores each of you doesn\u2019t mind and which ones you absolutely hate and see what the other can take on so that you\u2019re both in charge of chores you don\u2019t mind doing. \nFinding the right balance of chores where there\u2019s no resentment is a tough challenge of living with your SO. It\u2019s unlikely that things will always feel 50/50, sometimes it\u2019ll be 60/40 or 70/30 even. It\u2019s a delicate dance of accepting that some things will never change and communicating when you feel unappreciated or unsupported and coming up with a solution that makes you both feel balanced. \nIt\u2019s part mindset, part resolution.

He also can cook for himself and is not above making himself a quesadilla if he's snacky.", "NTA it sounds like he expects you to be his mommy. I'm not saying dump him, but do you really want to have to be mommy to a whiny grown man for the rest of your life?", "NTA. Normally I don't support playing petty games in a relationship, but he literally told you that he didn't care so you called him on his bluff. It's bullshit that he acts like cooking doesn't count as a chore, it absolutely is a chore. \n\nPersonally, I really believe that if only one person cooks in a household, then it's on everyone else in that household to ensure the chef never has to clean up after meals. The least he could do after you cook is clean up everything.", "NTA. \n\nHe needs to either make the food on days you\u2019re back later etc, or deal with eating Ramen if he can\u2019t be bothered to split chores. \nIt\u2019ll never be 50/50 but it shouldn\u2019t always lean toward one person doing the lions share.", "To  start he should be doing the dishes himself every night. Now this is for the cooking issue. But you 2 would do better to draw up a chore list and alternate picking a chore until all chores are accounted for. I think he should minimally be taking out the trash and dusting twice a week along sweeping and with doing dishes. And he should also be deep cleaning the bathroom ( I bet helearns to sit down to pee if e has to clean up after himself)to make up for you doing kitchen deep cleaning and grocery shopping. I bet you also make sure the bills get paid but if he does that don't remind him unless you actually make up a chorelist to pick from.", "Nope NTA. If you cook, he does the dishes and cleans the kitchen. And vice versa. Therefore, if he doesn't ever cook, he does the dishes and cleans the kitchen every night. Lots of things we \"have\" to do are chores- including cooking, laundry. etc.", "This is the kind of stuff that needs to be figured out, fast. Cooking does count as a chore, and his reaction proved its value to him. Cohabitation can be hard...", "I had a bf who would never buy groceries so I settled for him doing 100% of the cooking. But he also agreed to cook what I wanted.\n\nI have a different bf now and he too doesn\u2019t seem to ever want to buy groceries but he also doesn\u2019t want to cook\u2026.

These guys need to cook if they want to eat.", "Nta but why are you already doing 60% excluding the cooking?", "What was his response to you saying he doesn\u2019t care about food? That matters too and people just don\u2019t add that stuff for some reason.", "NTA you cook he does the dishes. That is a fair division of labor. He needs to step up.", "I think you asking him to cook a couple of times a week to compensate is a fair deal.

I've been cooking nearly 98% of the meals for over 30 years.  Do not do it.  Your boyfriend has arms and hands and can cook for himself.  Better yet, he could cook you dinner.

I'm pretty sure I know who.", "How is both is yours job routine? I mean, your work shifts are similar?", "NTA. But you don\u2019t have a cooking problem, you have a boyfriend problem.

I dated so many men in my youth and maybe 1 out of 20 cooked.\n\nIt makes me happy to see that with younger people, the men cook more.\n\nThat said i dont think you are asking too much for him to pick up an extra chore to compensate. If he does not care about food then he should have no issue just eating ramen on his own, otherwise.", "NTA but the division of labor you listed sounds much more like 80/20.

But also less mentally exhausting.", "It all depends on compromise and communication. My girlfriend likes cooking and baking. It's a hobby to her and she enjoys it. She hates doing dishes.

All he does is vacuum once a week and mop twice a month? I\u2019m assuming due to age that you don\u2019t have the largest place either, so how long might that even take to do? He is massively taking advantage of you, and he is testing how easy it is to continue pushing responsibility onto you. \n\nOf course he knows cooking for two is more work, as well as the work of thinking up recipes and going out to get the food! He\u2019s not that stupid. There\u2019s a reason he never cooked for himself: laziness. That\u2019s what \u201cnot caring\u201d means in his case, as he\u2019s shown you and you\u2019ve noticed. Of course he prefers your delicious meals and doesn\u2019t want to go back to ramen, but he is too lazy. His behaviour is beyond the pale. \n\nThis man is not your partner. He is using you as a surrogate mom, and you are the house manager. What a beautiful life for him. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re adding years to his lifespan, but are you shortening yours with stress? You two are just starting out in life and together. He should be on his best behaviour, trying to impress you. Do you imagine it improving in 5, 10 or 15 years down the road, with this being the initial dynamic during the so-called honeymoon period?\n\nI will finish with this, because I think it will also help you appreciate the extra effort you seem to be putting in this relationship.

I have a feeling you take it on automatically and are not entirely aware of it. I might be wrong, but a worthwhile read. Even the best male partners I\u2019ve seen with my friends and family tend to fall into this rut, so at worst, it\u2019s a good reminder to watch out for it.  \n\nWishing you good luck, and remember, there are plenty of good men out there who will not put you in this position and will be more equal and loving partners.

If he had looked surprised when you pointed out that you were doing more work by cooking every night and sheepishly offered to pick up some additional chores, I would say the relationship has some hope. But he is showing his true colors, that he sees you as the maid, and that he sees his own time as more valuable than yours. I predict that his contribution to the household chores will grow less and less the longer you're in the relationship. He is probably content to live in a dirty house and will wait for you to do everything. \n\nIt would get a thousand times worse if you were to have children with this man.
