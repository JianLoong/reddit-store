And anyway, making decisions like this without asking is in poor taste as a room mate, let alone partner.", ">Plus, he grew up with weirdly large pictures of dogs in the house, so it makes sense that he's not seeing it as a particularly weird thing.\n\nWhy is it weird. People have different tastes\n\n>Ask him to hold off for three months while he grieves & then you can talk about it again. \n\nOr put up the picture now and agree to talk about it in three months. An out of place picture is an easy sacrifice to make for someone that's grieving. \n\nEspecially if there really isn't anything in that home that identifies it as his, his first request should easily be honored.", "What? She Hitler'd every other square inch of the house, mate.", "Mate, she Controls every square inch of the house. That isnt a compromise.", "How is a large picture alot. Like dam let the person have something on the walls it's their home as well. \n\nSure it's a large picture but \n\n1) it can easily be taken down or moved if needed\n\n2) is important to him as both being about a beloved pet and the fact that it is his home as well\n\n3) even if it was the tackiest picture, so people care more about ascetics about one wall of a home then the grief of a loved one", "YTA, you dont understand that she Controls every square inch of the house.", "Hmm. I read that as \"a dog that belonged to him and his family, not me,\" while you seem to have read it as \"just a dog, therefore not important.\"", "When she said 'only', I think she meant it was never her pet.", "Read the whole OP...", "She already offered to put up a smaller picture.  He wants bigger than life and won't compromise.", "If she doesn't say something now someone could spend a lot of money on something she will hate.  Better to say it before it is ordered.", "The flip side is if this picture is a hulking great, flatscreen TV sized monstrosity, it is hella practical to consider whether a smaller, more permanent memorial is a better idea - something that they won\u2019t both dislike after a number of months/years and struggle to find a place for.\n\nOP, depending on how you approached that second call I\u2019m going tentatively NAH.  He\u2019s entirely reasonable to be upset at losing his dog and you not feeling OK with a massive picture, but you too are reasonable to suggest something that isn\u2019t such a significant item with associated long term display issues as a sensible alternative *depending how you approached it*", "Once the giant picture arrives at their home, then what? Try to convince him to get rid of something he already has? You can't return it.", "Be willing to bet this *giant flat-screen size print* is really only the size of a movie poster and people are imagining it to be the size of a wall.", "Ding ding ding", "Is that not manipulative?", "Did you read this post with your eyes close cause wtf \ud83e\udd23", "OP said he could have a smaller photo", "Exactly, a lot of people are saying NTA for alternatives but it doesn\u2019t matter because that\u2019s not what he wants. If he pays rent he should just do it", "And to everyone saying she suggested other alternatives,  that's not her place to say when she literally sets up the apartment to basically everything SHE wants, it's not a big deal and your just causing further anguish.", "How big is the photo?", "She did suggest a smaller photo.", "What size is the photo he wants?", "What is the size of the photo? OP has given vague dimensions.", "She offered lots of solutions", "We don't even know the size of the picture because OP is being vague.", "Come on", "A pet that she's never even met.", "I was thinking this too. It makes perfect sense to have a coat or hat rack right by an entryway that you use often.", "Was her stuff two yes and one no also?\n\nShe even said if it was a shared dog  she might feel differently. So I'm thinking it's not the size.", "As someone who has been in your husband\u2019s shoes, make sure he doesn\u2019t really give two shits about the decor. You\u2019re probably right, but some of us say we don\u2019t give two shits because it\u2019s either that or have to give way too many shits. People have different definitions of what matters - for me it\u2019s my dog, not the color of our walls, so I might not give a shit about my wife\u2019s paint choice but that doesn\u2019t mean I never have a single care ever. I just only have so many shits to give. If you want actual help with the decor and he says I don\u2019t give a shit, different story - at that point agreed, dog picture gets to be the decorator\u2019s decision", "I am big on design aesthetic too. I run all my plots and plans for decor through my husband. He likes my style. We both want to design a master bathroom around our shared cat, Ivy. An Ivy themed bathroom if you will. Shes the most wonderful little creature and we plan on having a huge custom painting of her done \ud83e\udd23. We love her that much. She's already in a family photo we put on the wall which is a 24x18. I may be into design aesthetic more than my husband, but I get his input every time I want to change up decor because it's OUR house.", "Lol I'm trying to convince my husband to let me blow up a massive canvas of our two dogs wearing reindeer antlers sitting in front of the Christmas tree for a lovely seasonal Christmas decor item. Dog photos are great", "Only reasonable response I\u2019ve seen so far. Everyone is acting like if he hasn\u2019t voiced an opinion before he never gets one\u2026 or maybe he knows his wife cares a lot more and is trying to compromise already by not questioning or arguing with her design choices\u2026 that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t get to want to look at a picture of the dog he misses (especially since this is the one design choice he\u2019s asked for and actually matches his parents\u2019 sense of style). Maybe it\u2019s just cuz I wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed to have a large picture of a dog on my wall\u2026 bigger the better in my opinion.", "Where does it say that?", "It isn't a house it is an appartment.  And when you try to decorate and the other person refuses to engage there isn't a lot you can do to make them. They both have veto power - if he doesn't like her decorations he can say so and they can agree on something else - but the fact that he didn't do any of the mental or emotional WORK of decorating the appartment doesn't mean he gets to take up the lions share of the space with something she doesn't like.", "WTF are you even on about mate?", "Could you have chose a more offensive descriptor? Let\u2019s compare saying no to a picture of a dog to the holocaust.", "Ah, yeah, you don't get to have no interest in decorating your house and then demand a life size memorial for your dog.  That's weird, and unfair.", "I wouldn\u2019t be against it myself but I can see it being A Lot. I just think he should take some time to consider something that large, they should discuss what picture to use, use VR to see what it would look like, measure out the space, instead of impulsively buying a giant photo of a deceased pet.", "If they are getting a huge print framed, there is no way the bf intends to take it down.", "Like those pictures cost a lot. LOL. Please stop reaching so hard. I am worried you\u2019ll pull a muscle.", "The WHEN also matters. The bad part here is TOO SOON. You don\u2019t step on someone\u2019s grieving process. The dude might have arrived at the same place in a few more days. \n\nBut nah\u2026this was A PRESSING MATTER\u2026apparently. \ud83d\ude44", "Not to mention a print of that size is going to be expensive.", "[deleted]", "A movie poster is big imo", "Whooptie do.", "A giant picture of a pet in the living room? You \"come on\"... That's weird as shit.", "He definitely doesn't care lol. We talked about it and basically he said what I wrote about overly girly and stuff, which I prefer for my own spaces anyway. He owned his own house for like 10 years before we got together (we we're friends all that time) and he never even had pictures or anything up. I am not too weird about my decor, I mean, our living room is basically a play room haha, but I care way more than he does so he can just tell me if he hates something and I won't put it out. \n\nI don't really know how anyone could be in a relationship long-term without talking about things like that anyway.", "Ugh. So tacky. She never even met the damn dog.", "The entire house has to be her aestethic, that is the entire issue she is having. Every single inch.", "She has decorated every single inch of the house. How do you not get that?", "...what is that take even? Seek help.", "Unless it's a studio or something even a large sized picture doesn't take up too much space. As for clashing with aesthetics, so what. If anything she should have offered to find the perfect frame and photo if she cares so much about how the place looks.  Her immediate actions just showed that she does not consider his feelings as valid.", "It's hundreds of dollars to get a canvas print that big.", "Have you ever got a picture printing and framed? They are into the $100s very easily", "Well, the mom was going to order it soon.", "I don't see OP as being the AH anyway, just someone who spoke before they thought. They really just need a time out on the picture and then discuss it when they're both emotionally prepared.", "No that\u2019s ridiculous\n\nIt\u2019s everything else you said in your comment\u2026.", "I think live, laugh, love pillows are obnoxious, I want to put a hole in every stupid blow up Christmas decoration I see, and people who get photo shoots done as a couple with no children are idiots\u2026 so I can understand thinking something is tacky but the point is until we elect a president of decor, no one gets to make a definitive call on what is or is not tacky.", "The issue is a gigantic photo which will dominate any room it\u2019s in, not that she needs to \u201cHitler\u201d every single inch of the apartment. Using Hitler as an example here is extremely dramatic.", "I do get that. And it sounds like he has never cared before that she took the design lead. But let\u2019s be real here, most people are not going to want a flat screen size portrait of a dog they have no connection to in their home.\n\nOP didn\u2019t say no, she said reconsider the size of it.", "Lol, turns out I couldn't care less what you think.  Life sized pet memorials are weird and off putting.", "Oh I don\u2019t really mean about clashing or aesthetics!!! I want him to have the photo I just think it shouldn\u2019t be an impulse buy. Maybe I\u2019m overestimating the cost. \n\nI just mean she should take a few days and work with him so he knows what it will look like there. And then decide if that\u2019s really what he wants. Your frame idea is really good too!!\n\nI\u2019m also a little biased I guess because a family pet recently died this year, and every time I see the photos of her I get so emotional. I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle something like that, though I\u2019d have thought it\u2019s a good idea at the time to memorialize her like that. But everyone\u2019s different and I need to remember that. \n\nUltimately I still think no one is an asshole here, and that they should take time to work together and find the best way HE wants to memorialize HIS pet.", "The middle part was a joke. Was that not obvious?\n\nThe end part is just harsh reality that softees can't handle.", "I think you may be my twin.\n\nThere are experts in decor. I guess you are right though.", "Tell him to get the ashes of his dog.", "No it was not obviously a joke. It was pretty mean. Hence the downvotes.", "Softees...", "Seek therapy or sometning", "Same. You sound like you need to toughen up.", "You\u2019re messed up"]}
