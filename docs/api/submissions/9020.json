{"id": 9020, "submission_id": "10sjqk7", "title": "AITA not running the errands he had planned today?", "selftext": "My husband and I split up chores/responsibilities as followed.. Me(30f): all cleaning, 85% cooking, getting kids on and off the bus, cat box. Him: laundry(laundromat), grocery, 15% cooking, dog responsibilities. He is an equal partner in a sense of children responsibilities outside of doctors visits, which I do. It's not equally split up by any means but I do have more patience so I take most the load. The kids have their own set of chores. I'm currently pregnant as well but not far enough along to get most symptoms. I have a bit of morning sickness but not severe and I have growing pains that sometimes really drain me, as well as being fatigued and tired damn near all the time. But like I said, I'm barely pregnant (9 weeks). \n\nAnywho, since my husband started working from home he has been wanting me to do laundry and grocery with him. It did bother me that he would even ask, due to me carrying most of the chores but a few times I did entertain it. As is we have to walk down flights of stairs, drive 20 minutes and then sit around for 3 hours and where there's 5 of us, it's a lot of laundry/groceries. I guess I don't feel like I should have to go with him to do either of these errands because of how much I already do. Well, today he planned for laundry and instead of saying he was going to do it, he said \"we need to go do laundry\". Right now it is currently -16\u00b0 with a wind speed of 32mph. I'm exhausted from having not slept at all last night (sciatic nerve is acting up and really painful) and I simply don't want to go help him and feel like I shouldn't have to. To be fair, our kids are going to my mother's this weekend and do need clothes but again, I do everything else and it's his chore. I also wanted to lay down and get an hour nap in after getting the kids on the bus because I'm just beyond drained from no sleep last night. \n\nHe got up as soon as I got back upstairs after having brought the kids down and said \"alright, you ready?\" So I just told him no, I'm tired, it's freezing out, my body hurts and I don't want to go and help him with his chores. I don't want to carry laundry down 3 flights of stairs and wait at the laundromat for 3 hours given how tired I am. I want to take a nap. He was immediately offended and said \"really? You really think I want to do it either?\" So I simply said it doesn't matter if he wants to do it or not. I do all my chores without his help and he can't do his portion and pull his weight without me helping him. He says I'm an AH because it's a lot of laundry and he's tired of doing it all himself. AITA?\n\nETA: Just to paint a picture since a commenter thinks I'm \"keeping score\", laundry is done twice a month, grocery is done twice a month. When he is done with grocery and laundry he will call me down to the vehicle, where I help him carry everything upstairs- so I'm still doing the chore too. Therefore he never has weekly chores outside of his dog, whereas I have daily consistent chores and I'm always doing something. BOTH OF US work full time from home.", "created_utc": 1675429198, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10sjqk7/aita_not_running_the_errands_he_had_planned_today/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He needs to take an L on this and step the fuck up.", "NTA. It is exactly as you say. The division of labor is settled, and you already have the majority of it. And he still *expects* help with his smaller portion. He is being the AH.  If he wants to renegotiate, that is something else. Also, if he does renegotiate, is he just going to ask to \u201cdo less\u201d with no compensation for you? Because that isn\u2019t going to work for you either.

First this is the division of labor that you both agreed to.  If he wants to change it then you both need to sit and have a conversation about it.  He doesn\u2019t get to just decide that your doing your chores and part of his.  Second, your pregnant.

No but unfortunately you have to do things even when you don't want to do them. That's life. He's being an asshole for expecting you to hold his hand while doing basic chores.", "NTA. He can keep doing those chores on his own. \n\nAnd being just 9 weeks pregnant doesn't say anything. I was so tired at 9 weeks that I would almost faint several times a day from exhaustion.", "NTA. Your husband is acting like a kid and should stay alone with the kids for two weeks so he realizes how much you are doing.", "NTA. His chores. His responsibility. His problem. He has no right to expect you to help him.\n\nIf he really hates doing laundry, then he needs to suggest a reevaluation of responsibilities between the two of you, where you can discuss and plan a new division of labor.", "Going to say NTA, I mean it sounds like you are doing more anyways and he didn\u2019t have a problem doing it before. Not sure why suddenly it needs to be both of you to do chores. Also if my SO was pregnant, no matter how far along, I personally would make an effort to do more of the housework.", "NTA.  Aside from caring for his own dog, your husband has two weekly chores while you handle multiple daily chores.  I'd be scared; seems like he wants a bangmaid.", "NTA\nSounds like you had an agreement and he\u2019s trying to alter it. \n\nI\u2019d try one of these. \u201cDo you NEED my help?\u201d or \u201cCan\u2019t you do it by yourself anymore?\u201d\n\nEither way, I\u2019d definitely look for opportunities where he can help with your chores.", "Do you think he is getting insecure that he might have to do more around the house now that you're pregnant and taking you along while he still can is his say of 'punishing' you for it (even if he doesn't realize it)?\n\nNTA. You're husband is TA and a massive one. You were doing more than 50% of the chores even before you were pregnant and now that you're pregnant, instead of taking up some of your chores he's actually asking you to help with his. He agreed to the original setting and the only thing that has changed now is the pregnancy.", "NTA, you agreed on the chores you both would do and you shouldn\u2019t have to go with him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s capable of doing it alone like he has been doing previously, he probably just likes the company because he\u2019s bored there.", "NTA, I think. I mean, you already talked/split up the chores. You do your part without his support. You help him when you can.\n\nI think he took for granted those times that you helped him and expected laundry to be a shared chore now, idk. I also don't know how you told him so maybe he didn't like how you said it?", "MORE INFO NEEDED:  Do you both work full time?

He has a few that are his. You've helped him with his in the past, but that doesn't make his chores your responsibility.\n\nIf he wants to renegotiate, he needs to take on other chores.\n\nIf doing the laundry twice a month is too much for him, he should start doing it weekly instead so there is less to carry, wash, and fold. I completely realize that will mean spending more hours per month doing laundry. But him not doing the laundry as previously agreed should not be an option for him.", "ESH\n\nSounds like a \"scratch my back and I'll scratch yours\" situation rather than a marriage. Clearly, now that he's having a full time job the \"equal responsibilities\" that took you both \"equal time\" are not so equal anymore for your partner. He's likely burnt out too. \n\nTry adopting a \"there's no I in a team\" mentality instead, acknowledge parenthood isn't easy, neither is having 3 kids and you're both burning out. Then sit down, together and instead of wasting your energy attacking each other - seems like he's adopting very defensive behaviour here - try to figure out what outside resources you have and how you can make this work.", "NAH\n\nChores suck in general. No one has to be excited to do chores. Go take a nap. He\u2019s a big boy he can figure it out on his own. And if he doesn\u2019t do it, he can deal with the consequences. It\u2019s not personal. It\u2019s a job.

Today is not that day. \n\nAdvice \u2014 after 31 yrs of marriage I know chores have nothing to do with love & respect. It\u2019s just shit that has to get done & it\u2019s not fun for anyone. So who cares if your husband complains while cooking... let him. None of this stuff is personal. \u201cIf you loved me you would want to help me do chores\u201d ....

I wish OP had actually read this instead of immediately getting defensive.", "Wow, your oldest child cares about your unborn child more than your husband. Automatically makes you NTA there. So with groceries does he make the shopping list as well? Because for me the actual grocery shopping is the easy part. It is the meal planning and list making that is the hard part.", "He is a grown ass man and needs to act like one.  Was he like this before you got married?  Did he ever live on his own?  Was his apartment a sty?  You are not his maid, you are equal partners.   Why should you take on all of the chores because \"he doesnt have patience for them\"?", "This is called weaponized incompetence and it\u2019s worked because you do the majority of the chores due to his whining.", "Omg and he refuses to clean cat litter when you're pregnant...\n\nIs he genuinely incompetent or just entitled with strong sexist vibes? \n\nI think you guys need counseling... if you decide you want to put up with this nonsensical man any longer. It's common for men to overestimate show much domestic work they do in heterosexual relationships, especially when kids are involved. \n\nI grew up watching my mom do the housework, cleaning, cooking, >90% childcare, all while working more and earning more than my dad. I ended up in some violent and very sexist relationship situations. Please think about what this is modeling for your kids. You're either teaching your daughters/afab kids this is okay for people to demand of them or teaching your sons/amab kids this is reasonable to expect. \n\nHim putting more work on you while you're struggling with pain and exhausted is not okay... Especially when it's because you're carrying a child that's half his. Has he been reading certain forums or following some wellknown problematic men? \n\nI'm sorry, but your husband seems like he's awful in pretty much everyway. I hope the sex is at least decent but there's no sex good enough on earth that would justify putting up with this nonsense for me. I'm really worried he'll be worse when you're postpartum and you may injure yourself. \n\nI think you'd have to hate yourself an awful lot to keep continue with things going as they are. Can you reach out to friends or family or even a local women's shelter for some advice? Like I really hope you can see how terrible he's being. I don't care if he was worse ein the past. This garbage is not something you should accept.", "That is called weaponized incompetence, yes, even being an ass is a strategy to put pressure on you so you will do it instead.", "Correct. NTA. Don\u2019t listen to these people", "Nta \nI took it more that way too. She is just trying to point out she is already doing most of the work and he is now trying to get out of the little bit he has. If she is already doing 80% and now he needs her to do half of his 20% as well, he is left with like 10% of the responsibility and a lot of free time. Op needs rest too. Ask if he just wants to go 50/50 on every chore, or handle his little bit.", "You ask how it\u2019s keeping score and then explain how you are unhappy with the current score.\n\nStill, NTA. If your husband no longer wants to do laundry by himself, then you should have a conversation about redistributing the chores so that he can pick up some extra chores to balance out the added work you\u2019re taking on.", "Literally the ENTIRE post is laden with numbers. Was he not like this prior to marriage?", "Right??? I keep thinking that all of these people who are like \u201ckeeping score isn\u2019t what marriage is supposed to be like\u201d are either rich (and have people to do things for them) men (and have women to do things for them) or \u201ctrad wives\u201d who think it\u2019s already their job to do things for men.", "I understand OP, but suddenly he doesn't and in his mind, he is doing more. You can't solve that by attacking each other, that's a down spiral for your marriage. The only way \"out\" of this conflict is to try and break the ice and agree you're both doing more than you can handle and look for ways to decrease the work load. Ex: \"If I cook two meals less a week, then I could do the laundry every other week\" \"How is that gonna work?\" \"Can we freeze and/or batch a meal, order food or ask one of our parents to cook or batch something for us? Would you be ok being in charge of batching?\" etc, etc. whatever works for you.", "That's not me becoming defensive. The commenter stated that my husband is working full time and therefore it's no longer equally split and he is likely burnt out. The fact of the matter is that it's never been equally split because I've been working FT the entire time, while still having 85% of the chore load. Adding in that I'm pregnant is the icing on the cake. \n\nAs for my other sentence in the comment: I've spoken to my husband. He is unwilling to change the chore load without taking less of a responsibility. He doesn't want to do laundry anymore but isn't willing to pick up any slack in any other category. Nothing that I said screamed defensive. I was responding to what the commenter said and trying to be quick about it to get to other commenters questions.", "He was actually worse before we got married. He has insane redeeming qualities and a willingness to learn. We were together 4 years before marriage. When we first got together, he refused to do anything at all. He lived with his sister, who was a hoarder. So it wasn't that he was intentionally being a pig, you know? He was taught that from a very young age so when we moved in together, he saw our house as sparkling clean, even when it wasn't. If he left dishes out for a few days, he thought nothing of it because it was still LOADS cleaner than living with his sister. He got himself in to therapy and did really well for awhile. Tried really hard. But since I found out I'm pregnant he has been wanting me to help him with everything.", "I will never understand these posts where the OPs are so unhappy about the division of household stuff. And go and have another baby, which just means more work, less energy and less time.", "He's not willing to pick up anything though in exchange for OP taking on any of his chores. She said in another comment he refuses to change the cat litter, even though she's pregnant, and also won't cook and turns into a jerk when he does. She said he also didn't start wanting her help with everything til she was pregnant. It's not OPs responsibility to support his delusion that he's doing half the work yet also want her to help with his \"half\" so... Even if he was doing half the domestic work, he wouldnt be doing it alone and it would mean OP was doing 75% if she was helping with his 50. He's not doing anywhere near 50% though. He needs counseling because he just thinks she should take on more work. That is the issue here. He is not being reasonable and is being very selfish.", "Is fine with a very inequal workload, still expects you to help with his few chores (while pregnant), complains about the very little bit of cooking he actually does and makes an uncomfortable environment for the whole family, refuses to take over the litter box even though it's a genuine health risk to you and your child while you're pregnant, is rude to you when you want to take a nap instead of helping him with his *twice a month* chore after finishing your daily ones -\n\nThose redeeming qualities had *better* be insane, because I'm sure not seeing the willingness to learn and there's a whole lot of Bad he has to make up for with them.", "My tubes were tied and have been since my last child (5). This wasn't planned and I wouldn't have tried for it.", "I read only OPs post and not any of the other comments as they did not exist at the time, I wrote solely on information OP had given at the time. I'm sorry that my comment is abrasive and to the point and might upset some, as I wasn't focusing on sympathy rather than resolution. However, starting the conversation with a direct attack (such as receipts of how little OPs partner does) will almost always lead to an argument as the other person is moved to being defensive. From then, most commonly for men it leads to stonewalling. From stonewalling, you end up reaching contempt and OP and her husbands relationship will inevitably break down if this continues happening. All I'm doing is promoting empathy in their marriage, as well as sitting down and discussing things calmly so her partner doesn't continue being defensive and thus unhelpful. Which will overall enhance OPs well-being.", "Ok, you are an exception to most posts here then."]}
