She threw a fit at this for how disrespectful I was being to her and began to turn to my partner and complain and whine about this and how I was trying to turn her into the bad guy. He doesn't like her being upset and quietly suggested that if I give her a ticket that he could pay the cost at which point I said that money wasn't the issue at all and the issue was that she couldn't see why a couple's trip wasn't exactly \"mother friendly\". She latched onto him having no issues with this and told me I was being spoiled and how if her baby boy was ok with it I needed to be too. \n\nAt this point i'd had enough and told her if she came along the trip wasn't happening, in private I told him that if he wanted us to have any future then he needed to work on his boundaries with her as i'm not having a MIL who will try and walk all over me and overrule decisions in the family. He feels i'm being unreasonable and that she's just protective and wants to be involved in his life, I come from a vastly different family background than him so perhaps i'm being a little too harsh in this all I know is my own Mother would be horrified at the idea of trying to tag along on this trip never mind demanding tickets...AITA?", "created_utc": 1691060953, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h15eg/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_needs_to_work_on/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You made your stance clear to her that your gift is for her son - your partner as is appropriate, not her. That's where all interaction between the two of you should end on this matter, any further complaints need to be directed to your boyfriend. \n\nYou're correct that he needs to be the one to set AND enforce boundaries with her. She is his problem to handle and he needs to handle it - do not deal with her directly anymore. If you can, have a frank discussion with him that your relationship is a relationship between you and him, not you, him, and mom. You never agreed to date his mother. Even frame this trip as a good place to start with those boundaries, its a significant date for the two of you and it would show that he respects not just you, but your relationship together. The two of you will be gone for a short period and its a good opportunity for you two reconnect as a couple and for him to do a little disconnecting from his mother. \n\nIt won't be easy, but keep talking through the issue and work together. Good luck and I hope you two get to enjoy that trip.", "NTA. She is overstepping.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What other 'firsts' would she demand to be part of in your future life? I get that your partner loves his mum but he needs to love you too for this to work.\n\nAlso, I bet if the standby arrangement fell through - as they do sometimes she'd blame you for 'not planning properly'. Cos she doesn't seem to understand what's actually on offer here. So there is a lot of down side for you to avoid by sticking to your guns.", "NTA", "NTA. This was very close to what happened to my niece in that a guy she had been dating a long time and actually got engaged to started showing his mommy\u2019s boy tendencies as the wedding date approached and it was only then she learned how nutty and overly involved his mom wanted to be. A\nAfter she tried to make the best of it for a few weeks, she finally had enough and called off the wedding and now realizes she dodged a bullet.", "NTA.  If he wants to date his mum and break up with you, he can go ahead; but you should not be expected to accommodate his overbearing mother because he can't set boundaries. Hard no on taking her with you. Your partner needs to draw the line.", "You have been shown the future of your relationship.  His mother, him and then you.  The first that she wants to go on a romantic planned trip is frankly astounding.  NTA.  But I'm afraid that I would be getting on your next flight and not looking back.  This situation will not change.", "NTA, but I\u2019m afraid you got yourself a mama\u2019s boy. Be prepared to always submit to her demands. In other words, RUN!!!", "NTA \n\n>   He feels I\u2019m being unreasonable that she\u2019s just protective and wants to be involved in his life\n\nThis is the real issue.   You privately discussed the situation after she was gone.  This sounds clearly like not a one off problem with her.   \n\nHe immediately says you\u2019re the problem, and there\u2019s nothing at all wrong with her wanting / insisting/ demanding to go.\n\nWelcome to the next 40 years\u2026..plan accordingly", "Recently a lot of people have said \"boundaries are something you set for yourself and not for others\". I don't necessarily fully agree with this for all cases and I think it's difficult to always know where the line goes. But I guess the idea is that you shouldn't try to change other people especially not with ultimatums.\n\nIf your partner cannot see that his mother's behaviour is not acceptable by himself and put his foot down, then maybe it's not the right relationship for you. If he only does something about it because you tell him to then is the problem really fixed?

Your mother and law and her son in a relationship that you are the third wheel on. \n\nDo you want to be with someone who will let other people speak badly about you to anyone, let alone someone who is supposed to care about you. \n\nHis mother will always win and he will never grow a backbone. She also will undermine you every which way from Sunday with your kids if you have them and will specifically do what you don\u2019t want cause she and her son decided it so you better just let it happen. \n\nPlease take yourself on vacation to somewhere you can find yourself a Partner and not a mommas boy,", "NTA. Good for you for expressing to her that she\u2019s overstepping, and asking your partner to set boundaries. I sincerely hope they do!", "NTA\n\nIf your boyfriend doesn't cut the umbilical cord, then you will be the one who is going to cut him off.", "NTA but it sounds like you are dealing with an unwinnable situation. The fact that your bf doesn\u2019t see an issue with his mother coming on your romantic vacation is a red flag. \n\nHas his mother ever approved of his romantic partners? Is she is single mother who has made him a surrogate romantic partner or is she just overbearing? One angle you could take is pointing out how his mother\u2019s behavior is going to affect every romantic partner he has, not just your relationship. Help him to see how his mother is the problem.", "NTA. It might be time to consider if you want to continue your relationship with this man who is not listening to the simple requests you put in. He needs to understand that his mother can't always get things her way if he's letting her walking all over you, just to get your perks. Please think about your well-being first and decide on how you want to process with your relationship if he's not putting in his time.", "NTA. In no universe does a mother belong on an anniversary trip. \n\nI don\u2019t know why your man is even entertaining the idea.

If the boundaries are respected all will be well, if they are not OP will have to make a decision. But you need to go always further", "I've been trying my best to be understanding it's why i've mostly ignored her jibes till this point. I think he feels a sense of guilt where she is concerned and has a hard time saying no as for all his childhood it was just the two of them but imo she has gotten too confident in her ability to get her way. I just hope this is the wakeup call he needed.", "I hope so too. Its understandable that he has a strong relationship with his mom, however\u2026 boundaries. There\u2019s just no rhyme or reason for her to be included in this trip. He\u2019s got to be able to start distinguishing the situations where his romantic partner takes precedence over his mother. Or, like you said.. no future. \n\nAnyway good luck. I hope it all works out for you in the way you want it to- whether that\u2019s with him or without him."]}
