She takes you along so you can pay for her. Those are two very different things. Let her go on her own and do something fun for yourself.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she's using you.

She'll continue to use you if you continue to allow it.  Dating is expensive and especially if your partner isn't working and you're paying for EVERYTHING, but she's showing no respect for you by continuing to let you drain your finances when it sounds like you really can't afford it as often as it's happening.  \n\n\nYou all need to sit down and you need to explain to her that you don't have the money to keep doing this.  Maybe once she graduates and gets a job things will get better, heck she's so close as it is, so maybe it will just mean a few months of being a bit more frugal.", "NTA I don't know the nuances of your relationship, but it sounds to me like gf is using you.

Just that you don\u2019t want to pay for this thing or go to this event. Tbh if doesn\u2019t even seem like you need to make it about the money. You end  up being the fifth wheel. So tell her to just go and enjoy her girls dinner.", "NAH. all y\u2019all talking shit about the gf\u2026 it\u2019s giving a bit of misogynist vibes. Yes, she is being insensitive. But we don\u2019t know her background or if she really understands that money is an issue for him. Maybe she really thinks she is including him. Maybe she thinks \u201cmoney being tight\u201d means something different to a 28 year old in a career than to an unemployed 24 year old. She just got her second bachelors at 24? Doesn\u2019t sound like a lazy exploiter to me. Sounds insensitive and like she doesn\u2019t really understand the gravity of the situation and loves her bf and wants him to like her friends and coworkers. OP would know better than us.\n\nI think the solution here is to first have a very vulnerable talk with her and say you really can\u2019t afford to keep doing that and she needs to let her friends know privately and ahead of time next time that the bill will be split evenly. She can tell them \u201cya know I feel bad that my bf always pays for us\u2026so from now on lets split the bill cuz I don\u2019t want him to feel used\u201d You should tell her what your budget is for 1:1 dates too, if you want to always pay, or have a convo about splitting the bill on dates too. It\u2019s so much better to be honest now and set expectations so that you don\u2019t build resentment towards her and she doesn\u2019t build resentment towards you for not wanting to hang out with her friends and coworkers. You shouldn\u2019t have to pay for them\u2026 ever\u2026 and it was more than generous to pay up until now. But cut it out or that will be the norm in your relationship and your savings will dwindle. If she takes that conversation poorly *then* you should consider leaving her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Communication would solve this.\n\nOnly you can decide if you want to be with someone who's getting assistance from parents. Hint that your post sounds a bit judging about that.\n\nEdit to add: actually the whole \"going out with girlfriends\" thing seems like a distraction. This is really about the type of relationship you have. Dating sometimes does mean paying for/treating the other person. I mean, that's a date. If it doesn't, you need an honest conversation that it's not the kind of relationship you are looking for right now.", "Nta, you\u2019re your girlfriend and her friends cash cow.

I think you run the risk of turning this convo into a bigger thing, about how you feel as someone who\u2019s had to struggle a lot with money dating someone who\u2019s getting some help from family. Your gf probably will be fine if you say you don\u2019t want to go but it probably will turn into a fight if you make her feel judged for getting helps with her car insurance while discussing her dinner with her girls.", "How is it that you end up paying btw? Does she ever offer? Not bring her wallet?"]}
