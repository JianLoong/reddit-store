Sounds insensitive and like she doesn\u2019t really understand the gravity of the situation and loves her bf and wants him to like her friends and coworkers. OP would know better than us.\n\nI think the solution here is to first have a very vulnerable talk with her and say you really can\u2019t afford to keep doing that and she needs to let her friends know privately and ahead of time next time that the bill will be split evenly. She can tell them \u201cya know I feel bad that my bf always pays for us\u2026so from now on lets split the bill cuz I don\u2019t want him to feel used\u201d You should tell her what your budget is for 1:1 dates too, if you want to always pay, or have a convo about splitting the bill on dates too. It\u2019s so much better to be honest now and set expectations so that you don\u2019t build resentment towards her and she doesn\u2019t build resentment towards you for not wanting to hang out with her friends and coworkers. You shouldn\u2019t have to pay for them\u2026 ever\u2026 and it was more than generous to pay up until now. But cut it out or that will be the norm in your relationship and your savings will dwindle.
