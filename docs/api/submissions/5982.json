You're becoming just as abusive towards your mother as your father and you can't even see it. Which you're a child so it's not surprising. \n\nThis is not normal behavior. Even when one parent is a stay at home parent. A nanny, child care, is a job people get paid for. A housekeeper is a job people get paid for.

One spends their time bringing in income, the other spends their time caregiving and maintaining. Both are equally valuable.\n\nYour mom has legal rights to half of your dad's income. She should have been able to spend at least six figures in any given year.

Usually a stay at home parent is contributing housework, childcare, etc. that would eat up more money than they could make at a job.  Therefore, their contribution to shared finances is not having thousands of dollars a month in expenses that are covered by the stay at home parent's work and then the incoming cash flow from the other individual goes towards a whole household budget.

That\u2019s why she deserves money - because she is performing labor that is compensated elsewhere.", "Your mother isn't \"unemployed\" she is a SAHM. Taking care of the house and kids is her job. Also no, it is not normal. As a matter of fact a lot of times it's the opposite. Who better to judge what household expenses are going to be then you know the person that's responsible for it all. Restricting her money to the point that she cannot do her job and take care of the household, and then belittling her for not being successful (when she was never going to succeed in the first place) is abusive.", "That\u2019s not how single income marriages are supposed to work, you know.

If she wanted to go to a book club, could she afford to buy the book? \n\nWith rising inflation I'm spending about $800 on groceries for our family of five. I'm also spending an additional five hundred dollars a month on replacing things that have worn out. My kids often need new clothes or shoes because they grow out of them or they are destroyed.

No one lords power over the other....that's financial abuse.", "Nope. No it's not.", "You are so naive.", "This is how your family and specifically your father works. Not how things work in other households. You have been raised to think this because it is your normal.", "There's a huge difference between being unemployed and being a SATM. Housework is work. Childcare is work. Running a household and organising everything is work. The fact that your mother's work is not paid by an outside entity is irrelevant.

And you're colluding with him to undermine her instead of helping her.", "That's not even kind of true. My mother is a stay at home mom, but the money Dad makes is just as much hers as his. Because they're married. Legally, everything they make is joint. Practically, that's also how they handle it.

Your father is able to work because she stayed home. If he had to take care of you all by himself, he wouldn't be where he is now. You need to wake up, a marriage is a PARTNERSHIP. She works also. Taking care of children is exhausting and never ends. Your father goes home at the end of the day and is done. She never is. \n\nYou need to live life a bit, your perspective is that of a child. I know you're young but you're also too old to be thinking like this. She absolutely contributed to the household. Half your father's income and property is hers.

She\u2019s not forced to live off of her 10k a year or somehow support our family on it. \n\nHonestly, she\u2019s basically the financial controller for our family.

It\u2019s not too late for you to respect, support and encourage your mother.", "We all intend to get a high paying job after college\u2026.", "How exactly do you expect her to pay for school when all of her \u201callowance\u201d is actually just the household budget?\n\nYou\u2019re woefully out of touch. Yes, MLMs are bad. I truly hate them and think they\u2019re predatory (especially towards those who can least afford it). However, you\u2019re missing the bigger picture here, that your dad is abusing your mom. I\u2019m sorry, but the fact that you agree with his actions is despicable. My heart breaks for your mother.", "So your mum deserves no compensation for taking care of the house, you and your brother for over a decade, if not nearly 2 decades? How you\u2019re not seeing this as financial abuse is wild to me.", "It's exhausting reading your comments. Why don't you think housework isn't work? If your mom dedicated her time taking care of you, you have no right talking about her like that. Have some respect for your mom ffs.", "You \u201cdon\u2019t need a job\u201d because you\u2019re in college?\n\nYour parents are paying for your college for you. That\u2019s right I said parents, as your mom is working just as hard as your dad does in order to run your family.\n\nDoes your mom come from a wealthy family where her parents paid for her college too? You seem to look down on her for \u201cdropping out of college\u201d but do you know her reasons why?\n\nGood luck with getting a \u201chigh paid job\u201d as soon as you leave college. No matter how many qualifications you have, you still need emotional intelligence and a personality to become employable and this is where you are seriously lacking. I certainly wouldn\u2019t hire someone with your values and attitude", "Child. No.", "Have you ever been outside? This is that rich person propaganda. TONS of people gain experience WITHOUT a college degree that allow them to climb quit high. My old job, the owner NEVER went to college. Didn't even graduate high school, he got his GED. He started as a cashier and worked himself up the chain until he could buy out shares and then the company. \n\nYou're so insanely naive.", "Lmao most folks I know who skipped college and went into trades make way more than college grads AND have less debt. You are coming across very entitled and out of touch with reality. Please stop parroting your abusive father and form your own opinions. Your poor mother shared her distress with you and you took a dump on her.", "You clearly have very little idea about the jobs that exist in this world, and what you need to do to get them. \n\nYou say your dad taught you these things but you\u2019re either very sheltered or, hilariously, uneducated.", "Plenty of college graduates don't make more than average income. Ask any teacher at a public school.\n\nI suspect your father has brainwashed you into thinking that college is free ticket to easy street and if you don't go, you deserve poverty.", "You are dead wrong\n\nI went to college/law school and make about as much as your dad. And I\u2019m probably about 20 years younger than he is and *gasp* female. \n\nMy older cousin\u2019s wife didn\u2019t go to college. Earns +$3M/year as an executive for international companies.\n\nThere isn\u2019t one comment agreeing with your or your perspective. Reflect on that.", "Yes, a good portion of the country is below the middle. That's what \"middle\" means.", "Did your Republican dad tell you this? Girl, you are going to fail at life so hard the moment he stops paying your bills. I recommend either being really hot or getting more intelligent.\n\nOne of the best BI developers I've ever known (made about 200k in Michigan) worked at a gas station with a GED while he taught himself how to code.", "College is *a* way to make money, if you major in the right thing. But there\u2019s so many other routes you can take to have a high income. The richest member in my family never even finished high school. He makes more than my aunt does as a psychiatrist, for crying out loud.", "That's all your doing here. You are the asshole here. Either see your error and learn from it or buzz off to another sub and complain about how everyone knows your dad is an abuser and you don't give a crap.", "The difference is people my age are supposed to be in college (generally), and people her age are usually working. But I don\u2019t care whether she works. It would be good for her to make friends and get hobbies though so she doesn\u2019t have to sit inside all day.", "That\u2019s what moms allowance is for!", "I actually think that there are better than even odds that dad will make this exact argument to OP\u2014that she needs to submit to his control because she is consuming his money rather than earning her own\u2014the instant he feels he needs leverage over her or she does something he doesn\u2019t like. He\u2019s a financial abuser and now has something potentially big to hold over his daughter in addition to what he\u2019s holding over his wife.\n\nMaybe not, and I\u2019m certainly not hoping he\u2019s planning on expanding his stable of victims. But abusers often don\u2019t stick with a single target."]}
