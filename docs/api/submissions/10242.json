Julia and I knew each other through friends of friends but hadn't really interacted much before. but she needed a roommate and I needed a place so our friend's put us together. We get along okay but we're really different in a lot of ways and I wouldn't call us friends\n\nI was excited because the house had a fireplace. They're super common here but I had been living in a studio apt for years.\n\nI started setting up a fire one night my first week there and Julia absolutely lost her shit. As it turns out, Julia is terrified of fire. All fire. Absolutely petrified of it. I can't say if it's a full scale phobia or not but it's an extremely intense fear. So I didn't light it but I was pretty upset that she didn't mention she wouldn't allow anyone to use the fireplace when I was looking at the house. But she didn't.\n\nI'm not allowed to light candles either and she unplugs every appliance and she immediately after anyone uses it because she thinks it will start an electrical fire.\n\nI try to respect Julia's wishes but I *like* fireplaces. I *like* candles. And we should be able to find something we can both agree on. But she refuses to compromise an inch and I'm really sick of it\n\nSo last night when she was planning on sleeping at her boyfriend's, I lit a fire in the fireplace, lit a couple candles and settled onto couch to read for awhile. It was nice and cozy.\n\nJulia's boyfriend apparently started feeling sick because she turned up at home around 10pm and freaked tf out when she saw. Hyperventilating and screaming at me that I couldn't do that. I reminded her that she said she wouldn't be home which was not helpful. She went outside for awhile to calm down and then demanded I come outside and talk to her.\n\nshe said that I had broken the rules and endangered her. she said it was \"her place\" so she had more of a say than me which really pissed me off. it's a rental. she lived here with another girl before me but I have signed a lease with our landlord and we pay equal amounts so calling it \"her place\" is completely unfair and I told her I'm not playing this hierarchy game with her. And that I never agreed to her rules because she didn't have any right to give me rules.\n\nI've finally lost my patience and didn't really hold back. and I told her I could have a fire every single night if I wanted to and light candles all over my room and she can't tell me anything about it. I only tried to respect her feelings but I don't know if I should even bother. She started crying and went to her room and is still in there now and it's the next day. I don't know if I feel bad or not. I feel like maybe I should because it's an extreme fear that's out of her control but also I feel like I should be able to use all of the house's amenities without being made to feel like I did something wrong.

What happened here wouldn't have affected her at all if she hadn't been home, as she had planned.\n\nHer reaction was unreasonable. Imagine even demanding that you step outside the house to talk to you.\n\nYou can reasonable expect to be able to use the house and all its facilities, including the fireplace. If you agree to be nice to her by not having a fire while she is present, that's a good thing. Still, if this is how she's going to be you might be happier if you move out.\n\nP.S., I'm a bit curious about the unplugging of the appliances. Does she do that to every appliance, even the refrigerator?", "100% NTA.  And it's all contained in this point:\n\n> she said that I had broken the rules and endangered her. she said it was \"her place\" so she had more of a say than me which really pissed me off. it's a rental. she lived here with another girl before me but I have signed a lease with our landlord and we pay equal amounts so calling it \"her place\" is completely unfair and I told her I'm not playing this hierarchy game with her. And that I never agreed to her rules because she didn't have any right to give me rules.\n\nYou are equals.  She thinks she has a right to dictate to you.  She is TA, period.\n\nPlus, it seems like none of this was disclosed to you prior to you signing the lease.  It should have been.", "NTA Couple of things  \n\n1) You respectfully waited until you thought she would be gone and no fear of triggering her phobia  \n2) She should have told you about this issue when you were moving in. That would have been common courtesy  \n3) You have a signed lease. That speaks for itself.  \n4) You probably need to find a way to reconcile the situation when you have both calmed down. Her fear is obviously real and you can't completely ignore that", "NTA. \n\nThat definitely should have been disclosed.", "NTA.  She knows she has an intense fear and didn't let you know before you decided to move in, which makes her TA.  That plus the extreme fear of electrical fires may veer into OCD/other issue territory.", "NTA - i mean you went out of her way to accommodate her fear.\n\nHer fear may be somewhat rational for the fireplace and candles, but definitely not appliances.\n\nI would get out of this living situation if possible.", "NTA\n\nYour roommate is an AH because of this line \"she said it was \"her place\" so she had more of a say than me\".\n\nI have zero respect for her.", "NTA. She can't control what you do in your own room and she doesn't get a say in what you do when she is not there. You were trying to be considerate. \n\nJulia needs to find a therapist ASAP. This is not a normal reaction, this is an intense phobia. What does she do when she visits restaurants, hotels or bars that have fireplaces and fire pits for ambiance? Does she scream and hyperventilate when she is walking near a bar that has fire features in the outdoor areas? In my area Julia would be having panic attacks pretty often from October to March.", "NTA\n\nYou did your best to me mindful of her phobias in spite of your own wants. You did this even with the, over the top, insistence that all of the appliances be unplugged when not in use. You waited until she was going to be out of the house before indulging in a comfy fire and enjoying some candles. \n\nYou were respectful of her throughout it all up  until she unexpectedly came home and lost her shit. Her phobias are not your problem and you were very accommodating of them by waiting until she was gone to act otherwise. However, it would be not only mean spirited but also cruel to light candles and fires when she is at home knowing full well this is a serious issue for her. \n\nI honestly suggest that one of you work to find another rental as this situation has all of the red flags for getting worse and more petty from here on out.", "NTA. You can be sympathetic towards a phobia and also not be willing to accommodate to someone's every will. It's your place too", "NTA.\n\nA person's phobias are their own problems, and while I understand no fires *while she's there,* requiring you to not have any fires *while she's not there* is absolutely nuts.", "Gonna say NTA.  If someone has strict rules they should be discussed before hand.\n\nHowever now a days there are many realistic candles on battery etc. Maybe those are a good amd safe option.", "NTA.  She needs to get counseling or move to a home with no fireplace.  It's a nice gesture to attempt to work around her fear by only having a fire when she isn't home or only having candles in your room, but she doesn't get to dictate your behavior in a home that is just as much yours as it is hers.  She also should have mentioned this when meeting prospective roommates.", "NTA.  You're on the lease and you have a right to reasonable use of the amenities.\n\nYour rant was a bit over the top, even if justified by her trying to use \"seniority\" on you. I think it would be OK to apologize for the rant but not for using the fireplace.\n\nIf Julia is willing to be reasonable, hopefully you can agree to reasonable rules regarding the fireplace.  Maybe get some extra fire extinguishers.", "NTA. I got seriously triggered hearing her say that it\u2019s \u201cher house\u201d when she rents it just like you. Had an old roommate use that line and I had to remind him he didn\u2019t own the house AND his parents paid his rent lmfao", "NTA You tried to be accommodating and she\u2019s insane.", " NAH- phobias are real and Julia should be getting support for it as it\u2019s clearly impacting her life negatively. What does she do at birthday parties or restaurants as they commonly have candles? Not realistic to expect roommates or anyone to avoid these things\n\nSince not using the fireplace or candles isn\u2019t on the Lease or discussed before you moved it than you are not required to follow that.", "nta i guess you know why the previous tenant left she didnt disclose this information on purpose because if someone didnt move in she would have had to cover the rent for the entire place i would just move out asap i dont think you have been there long enough for it to be an issue", "NTA\n\nHer mental health is her job. Her phobia of fire is not a license to control another autonomous adult. You were respectful. You made concessions in an attempt to compromise. But you do not answer to her, indeed. If a candle and fireplace can send her into such a tailspin, she needs to see a psychiatrist. Overcoming this debilitating emotional reaction is a her problem. You are not responsible for placating her unreasonable behavior.", "I mean, I survived a house fire that was started by an uninspected faulty fireplace and it almost killed me and my husband. She\u2019s not entirely wrong to have this fear. However it should have been communicated to you before you moved in with her. NTA", "NTA, but mainly because of the unplugging-appliances thing. If she\u2019s *that* phobic, she needs to disclose it to potential co-tenants at a minimum and I\u2019m assuming if she did that she would have mentioned the fire issue. \n\nOTOH, if the fireplace was that big a selling point, you should have brought it up beforehand because whether a fireplace in a given rental is actually useable is often a dicey proposition, and \u201cdon\u2019t light a bunch of candles\u201d isn\u2019t that unreasonable of a request from someone with a severe phobia.", "Julia's \"house rules\" should have been disclosed up front. Since they weren't mentioned prior to you signing a lease, and you pay an equal amount of rent, you understandably don't feel obligated to follow them. Since she didn't mention anything before you moved in, she's an AH.\n\nThat said, it's now clear to you that Julia has a previously undisclosed medical condition that makes fires or candles a big problem for her. Using the fireplace simply because you have a right to do so would be like getting a cat while having a roommate with cat allergies. Yes, you have a right to use the amenities of the home you are renting, but you'll be an AH if you do now that you're aware of the issue.\n\nIMO, one of you needs to move out. Your preferences are not compatible. If Julia chooses to move out (perhaps to a house or apartment with no fireplaces) she should keep paying her share of the rent until she or the landlord finds a replacement tenant. If you move out, Julia should cover both halves of the rent until she or the landlord finds a new tenant who will agree to no fires, candles, open flames, or other fire hazards.\n\nI suggest discussing those options with Julia to see which she prefers, then talk to the landlord.", "NTA - she has no right to set rules on common spaces or your room since you are on the lease and you pay the same in rent. She needs to be in therapy but you aren\u2019t responsible for her feelings.", "NTA you have been A LOT more accommodating than I would have been! I would be getting away from this living situation asap. In the meantime use the fire and light candles if you want to. And maybe therapy for her?", "Buy a couple of abc fire extinguishers so she can have one in her room and have one in yours. \n\nSit down and talk to her. Find out where the intense fear is rooted.", "NAH - the two of you just aren\u2019t compatible room mates.\n\nInfo - do you know if she\u2019s survived, been impacted by and/or lost someone to a house fire?  The degree of response has me wondering.", "INFO: is the fireplace in a common room? If so then anyone paying rent should not be uncomfortable in the shared space.

Also stick to candles only in your room(and make sure you have SAFE/secure candle holders.  \n\nGet some power strips that can be turned off at the strip for appliances(she can pay for these or at least half of them--since it's her problem).  Power strips can be mounted so you don't have to bend over as much.", "Yikes! I would have lost it with the unplugging everything. NTA you tried to be nice and not do it around her, but that wasn\u2019t good enough for her. That\u2019s a her problem, not a you problem.", "I think you could be TA. In any of your conversations with her, did you ever discuss any past trauma she might have? If she had been in a house fire, or lost love ones in that kind of situation it could explain why she has this phobia/possible PTSD.", "Can't really call her an ah. Can call her behavior irrational and say that she needs to seek help for her trauma. Fire is terrifying. I don't want to guess what she went through to have such strong feelings. But, you are an equal tenant and her issues are effecting the way you want to live happily. I'd say to do some fire safety research, get the proper escape kits, set up an escape route and game plan with her, make sure the fire place is clean and safe to use. If she can't agree to those terms, she needs to be the one to pay to break her lease. To address the candles, you don't need candles, there are wax burners and candles only create yuck", "My initial reaction was that OP was the AH. I knew someone who died in a fire, so I agree that it\u2019s not an unreasonable fear for the roommate to have. But then it occurred to me that my friend died because his clothes caught fire while he was using the stove. I still use my gas stove, though, and I still light candles. I often think about my friend when I do so, but it just makes me more conscientious about fire safety. I didn\u2019t stop lighting fires altogether, nor did I get upset when others light fires around me. So while I do sympathize with the roommate\u2019s fear, it is a phobia. I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for the roommate to ban any fire while she\u2019s home, and I think it\u2019s unreasonable to do so when she isn\u2019t home. And agreed that it should have been discussed when the roommate was showing OP the apartment. \u201cHey, yes that\u2019s a fireplace, but no you cannot use it.\u201d", "She was supposed to be at her bf. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault that she came home early. She pays the same amount of rent and is on the lease also. Why does the roommate get to dictate everything? She doesn\u2019t want OP to use the fireplace? Fine but OP should at least be able to use a freaking candle if she wants. Or how about leaving the Wi-Fi router, tv or microwave plugged in? It sounds like roommate needs a place to herself.", "If you move into a place with a fireplace, I think it\u2019s a fair assumption that everyone moving in likes fireplaces.", "The *lamps*??? I don't say this much but she definitely needs therapy. Also a basic understanding of home electricity and circuit breakers.", "Okay I was kind of empathetic over the fireplace and candles because I've been in a house fire before and it was traumatic. But the applicances!? That's beyond. She needs to be in therapy.", "This is just crazy. She needs help assp", "I\u2019d contact the landlord and tell him she needs to stop or he needs to let me out of the lease immediately because  she is violating my rights as a tenant and the rights of quiet enjoyment.  It was never disclosed and it\u2019s unacceptable.  OP is not on a sublease so she doesn\u2019t get to make the rules and clearly needs intensive therapy", "Everthing is just insane and the router would make me rise hell of a fire"]}
