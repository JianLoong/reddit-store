He asked you said no, that should\u2019ve been the end of it. But would like to add ask yourself if acts of intimacy (not necessarily adult fun time) is dying down both for you as giver or receiver. Like are you two still having fun together? I mean if everything is well and good and he\u2019s just complaining at every instance of a no then he kind an ah", "NTA\n\nJust because you\u2019re married doesn\u2019t make it your job to do whatever he wants whenever he wants and vice versa. He shouldn\u2019t have expected you to do it and his reaction to not getting what he wanted was just childish", "NTA, like that sounds kind of emotionally manipulative. I mean it\u2019s nice for your SO to do something like that for you, but it\u2019s not required. Plus it\u2019s not like you say no for small favor he asks. You where tired, and he should of excepted that. If he wants somebody to massage his back so bad, he should hire a massage therapist.", "NTA. Also from now on you don't fuck \"roommates\".", "NTA. You're his wife, not his servant.", "NTA. Go check out dead bedrooms sub,, where you'll get to see your probable future where a grown man throws a huge fit that his overtired, overworked, unappreciated wife is declining to be his anytime Fleshlight and he starts doing (somehow) less, harassing her about how he doesn't feel \"close\" to her, and begging for a handjob when she is too tired for sex (sooo intimate).", "Info: So you cook, clean, do the laundry, pick up the groceries and deal with your accounts. What does he do for you?", "Nta and I'm having a similar issue with my husband. And it feels like a losing situation", "NTA. Get the fuck away from this person. \n\nThat is emotional abuse.", "You do everything for him but sex, right? Normally people refer to their roommate when their spouse turns down sex.", "NTA I would be so pissed if this happened to me. I\u2019m not really a touchy person either and my partner is. He and I have mature conversations about meeting each other needs. To attempt to manipulate by calling you a \u201croomate\u201d (is it like a shaming tactic?? I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around it\u2019s precise desired effect.) is messed up and he should be directly confronted with that fact. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. I think how he reacts to being told this is manipulation and weird coercion tactics will be very telling you if you guys can grow through this.", "NAH. His reaction was over the top and annoying. However, using a cost benefit analysis, giving a 5-10 minute back massage with a roller or other handheld device is about the most low effort form of physical intimacy you can do and the recipient is usually very grateful since it\u2019s the one thing they can\u2019t do themselves. Especially after a long weekend of chores. It just kind of sounds like you don\u2019t like each other.\n\nEdit to add: I guess unlike a lot of commenters here I don\u2019t read into this as him asking for a sexual favor. I see it as more of a medical issue. Some people just have a lot of back pain that can easily be exacerbated by yard work. If it was my partner I would not want them to be in pain if I could easily do something about it. If it were me asking, I would start wondering how my partner would treat me if I got badly injured or ill. However again, he definitely expressed his frustration in a toxic way.", "NAH but there\u2019s something else going on. Is the massage an attempt to get physical contact from you? Have you been unwilling to do romantic/intimate things with him? He might be feeling neglected; it\u2019s worth finding the root cause.", "ESH - him for expecting you pamper him at his bidding, not acknowledging your work, and criticizing. You for cussing him out instead of reacting like a loving partner. He didn't call you a roommate, he said it felt like it. I think it's time to have a talk to him about why he feels like you two are roommates. Maybe you two need more intimate time scheduled. Obviously that does not mean you rubbing his back, he needs to show you affection as well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
