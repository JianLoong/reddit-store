I\u2019ve had the same step parents since I was 2 so as far as I\u2019m concerned my step parents are \u201cmom and dad\u201d as well. However, sometimes I feel like my step mom forgets that some parts of her life I\u2019m just not a part of, or, don\u2019t need to be a part of (I know, that sounds super rude, but please hear me out).\n\nThere\u2019s one thing in particular that bugs me every year, a Christmas party. My step grandpa (step mom\u2019s dad) was divorced and single long before I was even born. When I was about 11 or 12 he met someone, they dated for a year, and got married. Unfortunately, just a year after that she got cancer and passed away. She also had kids of her own from previous marriage and she hosted a Xmas party every year at her house, so about 2 party\u2019s total. \n\nWell, when she passed her kids started having the Xmas party at their house and we were always invited. The first couple years was fine, things were still fresh and it didn\u2019t feel too odd at the time. But honestly, it\u2019s been about 16-ish years now and at this point it\u2019s weird to me, and even weirder to my wife and kids. I try to get out of it every year but my step mom starts getting sad and I\u2019ll start getting texts like \u201caw but everyone was so excited to see you and the kids\u201d, \u201cthey\u2019ve been asking about you\u201d, etc. Which honestly, is not true, she just wants us to be there. \n\nThis really started to become a problem though when I had kids. The first year or two I had kids and brought them, there was no gifts for them (They hire a Santa to come drop of presents). Not that I go for the gifts, but I felt absolutely horrible that my kid had to sit quietly with nothing while 10 other kids ripped open dozens of presents. So, the following few years I started brining my own presents for them and credit where credit is due my step grandpa noticed this and started bringing them gifts as well. This is also how I know they aren\u2019t \u201csuper excited to see us\u201d. \n\nFinally this year I said we\u2019re not going. The biggest reason at this point is because I just find it weird and uncomfortable. The only \u201cfamily\u201d of mine that is there is my parents and step grandpa. The rest is all their side of the family and spouses family. Half of them don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m connected. The other big reason is there is also a nasty flu/bug/covid going around and there\u2019s 2 dozen other kids at the party \n\nSo I see no reason to go, I don\u2019t want to go as it is, it\u2019s weird, and I\u2019m trying like hell to not get my kids sick for Xmas. But now some are saying it\u2019s rude not to go and that unfortunately because I\u2019ve been going for 16-ish years now Its a AH move to just stop. But I mean, I have my own family now, my own places to go. It just feels like a waste of valuable holiday time. \n\nSo AITA for finally saying I\u2019m not attending the party this year and hopefully any year for that matter?", "created_utc": 1703006000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18m6zlc/aita_for_no_longer_agreeing_to_go_to_my_very/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I agree that this is something that is more important to your mom than it is to anyone else. I think you need to discuss boundaries with her. Specifically, she needs to not guilt-trip you into doing something that you don't want to do.", "His step mom is his mom in every way it matters. That means her father is effectively his grandfather (although it doesn't sound like they have ever been close). But his grandfather's late wife was not his grandmother and the family she had from her previous marriage was never really part of his family unit. \n\n(Step)-mom wants OP there because he is part of her family unit, but OP's connection with everyone else there is tenous at best. \n\nIf (step)-mom wasn't guilt tripping OP to attend, I would say NAH, but since she is, I vote NTA.", "NTA \n\nRepeat after me \u201cThank you for the invitation but regretfully we will not be able to attend.\u201d  If anyone argues simply say that you have a conflicting event.

This is a connection so tenuous as to be laughable, most of us would never even have met people of such a distant relationship.\n\nYou're NTA, just don't go.

But if you haven't said anything is there a way you or the kids could come down with a \"nasty bug\" yourself?  I was in this situation with cousins on Christmas until we decided to move our next relative visit up a day and leave late on Christmas.  Now I get all the guilt from my aunt but I can say \"but you know SIL, is divorced, how could we possibility leave her by herself for Christmas dinner?\"", "Life circumstances change.

The character limit prevented me from delving into that bit but honestly your read it perfectly. \n\nIn total fairness I don\u2019t believe she means or does this in a malicious or conceited manner, but I\u2019ve definately noticed as I get older it\u2019s very much an \u201cappearance\u201d thing. There\u2019s always a photo involved, it gets printed, it gets shared, etc. She just likes being able to say or show we were all together. And I usually did it to make her happy and like I said I genuinely don\u2019t think she means it in any ill intent manner. \n\nHonestly I largely think it\u2019s due to the fact she very much sees and considers me as her son (which I\u2019ve always gave her praise for), but because of that she doesn\u2019t realize the incredibly awkward and uncomfortable situations she puts me in when it\u2019s pieces of her life that I don\u2019t really have a connection too.", "Yes, my parents had me young (like high school young) and obviously it didn\u2019t work out with them. But the person they met after they are still with today, so I genuinely don\u2019t know anything else other than them. So they were very much just a second mom and dad and for all intents and purposes I was really their first kid. And to their credit they always treated me as their own. I have no complaints in regards to my step parents. \n\nHowever, yea my relationship with my step mom\u2019s dad is minimal. Not for necassarily bad reason, he\u2019s just a very quiet and reserved person, a man of very few words. So I haven\u2019t ever just \u201chung out\u201d with him or did anything with him. But he also still sends me a birthday card, Xmas card, etc every year without fail. \n\nWhere as on the flip side I was very very close with my step dad\u2019s family. They were very involved in my life and I had a very strong connection with them. But my steps mom\u2019s side was just never around and never involved. And it was really only her mom and dad, there were no aunts/uncles, her grandparents passed away when I was very young, no cousins, etc. \n\nAnd literally this just now came to me when responding to your comment, for some reason the pieces just clicked that I don\u2019t think her family were really involved in her life either. Hence why she\u2019s probably so obsessed with keeping a good family image and wanting us to be in everything even though we don\u2019t really belong in that something. It\u2019s just her way of trying to stay involved.", "That's a bit sad for her.  Maybe weigh how much it means to her vs. the irritation of going.  But you aren't wrong either way.  Just make sure she knows how much you love her!", "We did a Christmas thing with my husband's step-mother's family. It was . . .  fine, I guess, nice enough people and all, but I don't have any real connection or relationship with any of them. Didn't suck but nothing I would want to do again.", ">And literally this just now came to me when responding to your comment, for some reason the pieces just clicked that I don\u2019t think her family were really involved in her life either.

It must have been a dream come true when her father remarried and she suddenly had \"siblings\".\n\nYou were raised by an almost literal village. I do not envy your holiday shopping list.  Or your holiday visiting schedule."]}
