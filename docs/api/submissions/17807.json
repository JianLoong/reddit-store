A smart, polite, generally well behaved toddler who we have poured all our time and energy into, in order to make sure she continues to be a child we can bring anywhere and never have issues with behavior (aside from the normal, occasionally toddler things).

They are always crying, or yelling, or destroying other people's property. And you would think okay two toddlers, how bad can it be? They are always hungry and they are always tired. The parents of the children never take the time to discipline them so no one else in the family feels like they can either. They don't clean up after them either.

It becomes awkward to tell our child openly not to do something that their kids are doing at the same time.

We have begun avoiding them and making excuses not to get together.

As the mom of a preemie this has always been a huge hurdle of ours with people respecting our wishes to not be sick or have their sick children around our little. \n\nMaybe BIL has the opposite thinking of yours that if their children are around another child who is well behaved the kids may start modeling your child\u2019s behavior.
