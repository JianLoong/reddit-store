When she got engaged she asked me (30f) to be a bridesmaid approximately a year ago. Recently she gave out her bridesmaid proposal boxes and I did not receive one. I was cut out of the wedding party. I never said anything because personally I feel like it would come across selfish and if she selected people to be apart of her day then so be it. I was hurt though. \n\nA little backstory, my sister and I have history. She has done some very wicked things to me. As example she had a baby when I was 15 YO and told me if I babysat for her everyday after school she would gift me her old car on my 16th bday. Fast forward after babysitting for 6+ hours every day for a year, she sold that car and kept the money and told me to get over it. \n\nMy sister has excluded me from all wedding activities such as dress shopping etc but yet my SIL/Mom/Grandma etc have all been invited. \n\nNow back to the wedding- I recently got the invitation and scanned the QR code to go to her wedding site. Where I discovered that I was excluded from a plus one as well and cannot bring my boyfriend of 2 years. If I were to go to this wedding that I was already de-bridesmaided, I would also have to attend alone. I decided I honestly did not want to go and told my mother. She\u2019s calling me the a hole telling me that I\u2019m going to regret this and it\u2019s ridiculous to not attend over some bad history and \u201cyour boyfriend not being allowed to come\u201d. For reference it wasn\u2019t about the plus one, it was just my final straw. \n\nAITA or am I justified in my decision?", "created_utc": 1686780233, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149kl3y/aita_for_not_going_to_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is an AH-she dangles \u201ccarrots\u201d (car, bridesmaid) in front of you then does not follow through. You\u2019re right, the plus one is the final straw.

Your mother isn't being very understanding and I'm sorry for that.\n\nThat you don't even get a +1 is interesting, especially being the sister of the bride.  Adding that on top of being unceremoniously bumped from the wedding party and being excluded from all wedding activities, I'd consider not going too.

I'd still request the PTO and I'd probably go on a trip and enjoy myself with the money I was saving not attending my narcissist siblings wedding.", "NTA.  Your mother doesn't like that you won't pretend to get along with your sister.  She wants a fairytale.  I don't see why you should have to provide it, but you do what works for you.  I'd be disinclined to go were it me.\n\nTell your mother that your sister doesn't really want you involved and you're not in the mood to be involved.", "Yeah, skip it with my permission.

Does your experience with her lead you to believe she lacks any genuine love for you ?  Is she capable of empathy?", "Your mother saying you will regret this shows how ridiculous family is. It's just about control to them. They hate the idea that you can make up your own mind without their interference.\n\nWhy on earth would you regret not going to this wedding? Of a sister who blatantly cheated you and expects you to attend solitary?\n\nShe can stuff it. NTA.\n\nDon't give her a present, either.", "NTA -  but she's your sister.
