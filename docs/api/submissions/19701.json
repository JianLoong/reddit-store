When she got engaged she asked me (30f) to be a bridesmaid approximately a year ago. Recently she gave out her bridesmaid proposal boxes and I did not receive one. I was cut out of the wedding party.

I was hurt though. \n\nA little backstory, my sister and I have history. She has done some very wicked things to me. As example she had a baby when I was 15 YO and told me if I babysat for her everyday after school she would gift me her old car on my 16th bday. Fast forward after babysitting for 6+ hours every day for a year, she sold that car and kept the money and told me to get over it. \n\nMy sister has excluded me from all wedding activities such as dress shopping etc but yet my SIL/Mom/Grandma etc have all been invited. \n\nNow back to the wedding- I recently got the invitation and scanned the QR code to go to her wedding site. Where I discovered that I was excluded from a plus one as well and cannot bring my boyfriend of 2 years. If I were to go to this wedding that I was already de-bridesmaided, I would also have to attend alone. I decided I honestly did not want to go and told my mother. She\u2019s calling me the a hole telling me that I\u2019m going to regret this and it\u2019s ridiculous to not attend over some bad history and \u201cyour boyfriend not being allowed to come\u201d.

It's a pretty decent guess since she has already shown manipulative behavior when she got you to babysit and rescinded the offer to gift you the car.   I'm assuming she's displayed more of this behavior before.\n\nYour mom is overly focused on your sister's \"big day\" without clearly seeing the poor behavior of your sister, blaming you.  To be honest, she may have sent you the invite for one of two reasons:\n\n1. If you didn't get one, your mom would have nagged your sister, and who would want that?\n2. You were added without your plus one to make you look pathetic and alone vs your sister who was getting married.  Further displaying the stark difference she wants everyone else to see that you are pathetic and she is not.

If you don't go, it will give credence to the rumor mill, which is appropriate. \n\nYour bf and you should take a vacation during the week of wedding. Be away for the madness relaxing someplace you always wanted to go. Post some fabulous pictures and don't let your sister bring you down.", "Why would you even dream of it? NTA.", "NTA \n\nNeither your sister nor your mom have your back. You\u2019re better off without them.", "NTA. You would regret going even more.\n\nAsk your mother why your sister wants you to be there if she doesn't even like you in the first place.", "NTA.  Ask yourself if you will regret it in 5 or 10 years.  If you are sure, tell you Mom you'll risk the regret and pass on the wedding.  I don't think you sister wants you there--but be forewarned, I bet she will use you not coming to hold it against you for a very long time.  But truthfully, from what you say, she'll probably find something to hold a grudge for.", "Your sister is TA and your mum is enabling her", "NTA.  I wouldn\u2019t go either. I would have cut her out of my life after she sold the car.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s an invitation not a summons so you can say no. Don\u2019t talk to your mom or any family members about it. Just RSVP no and don\u2019t go. It\u2019s no one\u2019s business if you aren\u2019t going. Your mom only wants you there to look like the perfect family.", "Save your sanity, save your self and walk away from this crazy situation. I\u2019m very disappointed in your mother that she\u2019s ok with you being a punching bag for your sister. You don\u2019t own you sister anything, in-fact she still hasn\u2019t paid you for the babysitting. All you can do is keep them all at a distance as you laugh at the stupid and balls of them all", "NTA. If you don't go. I'd even create a \"free babysitting\" Certificate for the hours you babysat for the car & = Fulfilled, for her gift. Eat the meal, & go home to your +1!", "NTA. Don't go, dont get her a gift. Don't give in to any whining.", "Plan an amazing getaway with your boyfriend for the weekend of the wedding. Post pics the entire time! You are NTA.", "NTA... She is a person that stole from you. She is a user, and disrespectful. I can't see how you would want to spend an hour with her let alone go to her wedding. If it was me, she would be in the ignore section of my life.", "I wouldn\u2019t go.", "NTA.\n\nBut I would reccomend confronting your sister. Call her out on her shit. And just be clear and concise what behaviour seemed unwarranted and confusing. Ask her for an explanation and try to \"kill with kindness\". Then whatever she says, your response would be to clearly state you are offended and do not feel welcome, therefore will not attend.", "NTA. Though the petty me thinks you should go and list the highlights you\u2019ve stated here in an eloquent speech.", "Dont attend the ceremony, go to the reception. Get drunk (free bar!), eat expensive food, then have your bf pick you up and leave early. Also, NTA.", "Will there be an open bar? Do you like the people going? Never spent more than a few minutes with a bride at a wedding. Just saying.", "NTA  Personally until such a sister gave me the money / a car I would just have a L  C  relationship with her.  Weddings are boring.  Enjoy your freedom.", "NTA, but be the AH. Go on a trip with your boyfriend and show how much you enjoyed your time. Make her seethe by showing how great your life is irrespective of her bullshit and revel in the fact that she believes she cannot get to you anymore. Don't accept anything she offers and say no thanks, because you are happier with you have, as well as your life choices that have nothing to do with her.", "Yeah\u2026your mom is not seeing the bigger picture. NTA & don\u2019t go. Who cares.", "NTA. Keep those people at a distance.", "NTA.....smart decision. Go out with your bf.", "ESH. It doesn't sound like you have a good relationship with your sister anyway so you're probably doing both of you a favor by not going. It does seem a bit rude that she asked you to be a bridesmaid and then didn't even say anything when she changed her mind, but it's also pretty entitled to be mad about not being allowed to bring a plus one. It's her wedding and totally normal for plus ones to not be included.", "I agree. I wanted to also say, don\u2019t get her a gift either, if she says anything you can mention that you did babysitting for a year\u2026for free.", "The line I've been seeing lately is \"It's an invitation, not a summons.\"", "I really don't understand how op will regret this decision.", "I'm guessing mom only wants OP there to keep up the happy family facade. And yes, probably the go-for and clean up crew for the day. Now who will do all the extra work for free?", "YOU are TA for thinking that. People can exclude plus ones if they want. Weddings are expensive and there's no obligation to pay for some random person you barely know. If both people were close with the couple, they'd have both received an invitation. How entitled or codependent do you have to be to get upset about not being able to bring your SO to ONE event that isn't even about you?", "This is the exact words my bf said and my bestfriend", "Yep, or missed a flight. Medical emergency", "I would have to say because of my nieces, they\u2019re so sweet and I love them so much. Previously my sister and I had a heart to heart about two-three years ago where I told her how I felt and it didn\u2019t go very well, but a Little after she had came to me apologizing and asking me to be her bridesmaid. I thought we were finally getting somewhere but I\u2019m starting to think it was just the opposite. And some other commenters mentioned \u201csetting me up for failure\u201d and it\u2019s brought a lot of realization to my eyes.", "As you get older you make your own family from partners, friends and children. Family supports, loves and uplifts you, they don\u2019t treat you like your mum and sis do.", "Why would you value someone who treats you like shit lol", "She has their grandchild. Probably grandparents don\u2019t want to get cut off from the kid.", "This.", "Omg THIS", "WHAT WILL PEOPLE SAY???!", "Be the bigger person. /s", "Oooh, I like this line", "Very good point, what is there to regret? Sitting alone eating cake while everyone fawns over sister? Boo hoo, what a terrible thing to miss.", "I think the only thing OP would regret is going!", "I don't know your family dynamics but if she's denied you bringing anyone it's probably so she can laud it over you \"look at me married and happy whilst sad pathetic sister sits in the corner single, where's your plus 1 sister of the bride?? Sad and lonely at 30\" \n\nDon't go and give her the satisfaction and definitely don't invite to your own wedding. If you have to just explain to your mum you don't feel comfortable going without your boyfriend when everyone else is permitted a plus 1 and then ignore them. I distanced myself from my family and now live far enough away that I can miss out important life events like marriages and babies and my life is much better for it.\n\nNTA", "idk I feel like it\u2019s different when it\u2019s immediate family?  I\u2019ve been invited to birthday parties for boyfriend\u2019s sisters when we\u2019ve only been dating a few months. if this were just a friend then sure but op\u2019s bf is closer to a brother in law", "Probably best to not go and limit contact with those that judge you negatively for it. Especially,  if they are aware of her past treatment of you and how she had treated you throughout this situation. I hope things improve", "\"Medical emergency\" even better.  Can't argue with that.", "Well said. Your family is who you choose to love and surround yourself with. It doesn't always have to be biological.", "This 100%, I'm going to my brother's wedding only because my mom will get angry at me if I don't but I have almost no relationship with him except a toxic one, so I keep it to minimal contact. \n\nBut over the years I have built my family. Yes there are people who are blood related to me but they are just people. My sister, is truly someone I love, adore, and know I can rely on in any situation. I have my husband and my beautiful baby boy. Then there are my friends, like my sister, I have several close friends I have culminated who I love, adore, and know I can rely on in any situation. They are my family. \n\nI know this is hard, OP. You've been programmed to believe real family is those blood related, but it's not. It just means they have an excuse to abuse you and guilt you if you try to walk away. This is something that is hard to forget when venturing out on your own, but it is worth practicing so that you can build that real family.", "OPs sister definitely sounds like the type of person who would use the kids as pawns.", "Explosive diarrhea from gas station sushi.", "You\u2019ve never set a boundary before, so they\u2019re going to fight this one HARD. Don\u2019t give in. You decide what you\u2019re willing to put up with. You can\u2019t control what they do, but you CAN control what you put up with and what you choose to do. NTA"]}
