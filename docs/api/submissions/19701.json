I was hurt though. \n\nA little backstory, my sister and I have history. She has done some very wicked things to me. As example she had a baby when I was 15 YO and told me if I babysat for her everyday after school she would gift me her old car on my 16th bday. Fast forward after babysitting for 6+ hours every day for a year, she sold that car and kept the money and told me to get over it. \n\nMy sister has excluded me from all wedding activities such as dress shopping etc but yet my SIL/Mom/Grandma etc have all been invited. \n\nNow back to the wedding- I recently got the invitation and scanned the QR code to go to her wedding site. Where I discovered that I was excluded from a plus one as well and cannot bring my boyfriend of 2 years. If I were to go to this wedding that I was already de-bridesmaided, I would also have to attend alone. I decided I honestly did not want to go and told my mother.

It's a pretty decent guess since she has already shown manipulative behavior when she got you to babysit and rescinded the offer to gift you the car.   I'm assuming she's displayed more of this behavior before.\n\nYour mom is overly focused on your sister's \"big day\" without clearly seeing the poor behavior of your sister, blaming you.  To be honest, she may have sent you the invite for one of two reasons:\n\n1. If you didn't get one, your mom would have nagged your sister, and who would want that?\n2. You were added without your plus one to make you look pathetic and alone vs your sister who was getting married.  Further displaying the stark difference she wants everyone else to see that you are pathetic and she is not.

Good luck to you!", "ESH - you should fix the relationship with your sister", "**NTA:** \n\n^(Hope you read this.)\n\nI read your post carefully several times and your sister has set you up to fail. First, she raised your hopes/got you excited by asking you to be her bridesmaid. Being asked is a big deal whether you like your sister or not. Then, later, she jerked that \"honor\" away as fast and coldly as she could through the act of exclusion. That was no accident. That is some next level \"narcy\" abuse. When a person close to us \"excludes\" us from something, it is meant to hurt. Everyone else got proposal boxes? Yeah. Message received loud and clear.\n\n\\[If she got called out on that by someone, I am 100-percent certain that her explanation blamed you. It's sure as hell not going to be her fault.\\]\n\nThen, as we get closer to the wedding, you were excluded AGAIN. Several times and probably without explanation. And while that's going on, and it's trickling back to you, you were also kept in the dark about ANY role/part/attendance in the wedding you might have, which she did to confuse you and keep you off balance. Abusers love that strategy \"keeping you confused\" with inaction because it gives them plausible deniability over any outrage you might display. \n\nIf it was just like you wrote in your OP, and she kept excluding you, didn't tell you anything, and didn't ask anything, she is smart enough to know: \n\n* it is confusing and keeps you off balance, \n* isolates you further, and \n* is hurtful enough to create animosity without actually having done anything because you can't prove a negative. \n\nLook what happened when you confided in your mom. You were \"the crazy\" one, the a-hole. \n\nSo then, your sister's latest arrow to your heart is brilliant, and very tricky for you to navigate. When you weren't expecting, and didn't even want one, she sent you an invitation, but without a plus-one. Cold. (Did she plus ones for lots of others? Or just you?)\n\nSo: If she is the star of this movie, your casting as a bridesmaid was an important, supporting role. And now, you're like an extra in the background of a large, important scene in her movie, starring her, and now you have the decision to go, or not go. Tough dilemma. \n\nLooking for an answer only good to myself, and what I would do in this situation, no one else, just my view towards and opinion, I see it like this:\n\n1. If you go to the wedding and stay, she might do or say something to humiliate you further. Even if you go and nothing happens to you, you could feel as if you have compromised yourself, your principals. It can hurt if it feels like the bad guy always wins. That's a horrible feeling. \n2. Not going to the wedding will make you the bad guy in their eyes, but only in their eyes. If it were me, going or not going would mean the difference of cutting this toxic person out of my life forever. Am I prepared to do that? If she's 35 and still acts like this, and mom is blindly on her side, she has no motivation to change. It's working for her.  Even so, if I had the love and support of other family members, I would seriously consider going no-contact/limited contact. To me, not going would mean not going back to my sister because I recognize she will never get better, and I have a right to protect myself from toxic people, including siblings. Despite the guilt laden propaganda our parents tell us, getting along with our brothers and sisters is not a commandment in the Bible. We are not going to hell for going no contact with sibling.\n3. Be diabolical yourself: You can attend for a few hours, be seen, greet all of your extended relatives and be very, very nice with them. Steal your sister's show by killing her \"fans\" with your true kindness and love. Talk to them about them. Care about them.  Offer to get up and go bring something to them, but never say anything about your sister, good or bad. Just return the conversation to them. Long after it's over, they will remember you as much as they did her and will have your back if your sister tries to paint you as the crazy one with some cookey.                     \nThen later, when everyone is tipsy and dancing, just slip out of there like a ghost. Don't say anything to anyone. Meet up with your boyfriend, turn your phone off, and go have a midnight picnic with wine and dessert at some private place where you look up at the \"real\" stars of the night. Wham. Bam.

There's a drainage pipe nearby.  Now and then some barely drinkable water drips out of it.  It's enough to keep the weed alive.  People come out back to smoke sometimes and flick their cigarette butts in the weed's general direction.  And sometimes they call it \"you poor damn thing, what are you doing here?\"  It's something.  The weed isn't entirely alone.\n\nSomebody walking along the access road notices the weed.  They come back with a bucket and a spade and dig it up.  The weed is terrified.  Everything familiar is being torn away!  Where is it going?  What's going to happen?\n\nThe weed finds itself replanted in a green lawn beside a clear running stream.  Everything is so strange.  There are ducks instead of trucks.  Soil instead of dust.  A neat little picket fence around it, instead of the gray rim of the ditch.  Strangers wander past.  Sometimes the weed sees people from the factory, but they never even look in the weed's direction.\n\nBut...\n\nA winter and a summer, and that weed is a springing sapling, tendrils uncurling, leaves abounding.  A few more years go by, and the weed has become a laburnum tree whose golden chains of flowers sway in the breeze.  Some sour-faced people resent it for showing by its mere existence that there is life beyond the factory.  But others come to rest in its shade, and admire its resilience.  All it needed was good water and soil, a place free from poisons and careless stamping boots.\n\nThe secret to recovery, my therapist told me, is realizing that you are the weed *and you are also the gardener.*  You can take *yourself* to a better place.

Your lack of presence is definitely a choice and not an accident. :)", "And if she gets worked up about it, tell her to \"get over it\".", "Give her a card and inside it write, \"My gift to you: free babysitting for one year in 2003/2004.\"", "Usually I say invite = gift but in this case I would have to agree and honestly I don't think sister even wants OP there in the first place and the bridesmaid snubbing and lack of plus one were just a petty power move to ensure OP didn't attend while still giving the sister a chance at playing the victim \"but I invited her\".", "Obviously she'll regret ruining her relationship with someone who manipulates and lies to her because then how will she be manipulated and lied to? Duh! /s", "And honestly, your mom should be standing up for you! I\u2019ve read of other brides treating their siblings like dirt and the parents step in and say, \u201cStop this nonsense or we\u2019re not contributing to the wedding!\u201d\nTypically works like magic.", "Holy shit gaslight more.\n\nIf my sister didn't allow my GF of three years to come to her wedding I'd be pretty upset. \n\nOn top of all the other blantant manipulation? OP is a saint for even considering attending\n\nIt's not entitled to expect to bring a long term partner to your sister's wedding it's fucking expected.\n\nI've attended three weddings this year, none with more than 50-75 people. I haven't seen two of three couples in 2-3 years. I had a plus one. The $25 catering plate for you siblings SO isn't gonna break the bank.\n\nYTA not OP", "Because its expected?? Older couples in long term relationships tend to attend events like this together, and its expected that immediate family in long term relationships will bring their partners. Its not entitled, its the way things are.\n\nThe only exception would be if it was a small wedding and literally NO ONE got a plus one, which I highly doubt is the case here.", "It's co-dependent to want to bring a partner of 2 years to your sister's wedding?", "Oooh. That sends a MESSAGE!", "Yes.  I should have added that to my original comment lol.", "This 100%", "If she had the child at 15 and is 35 now, the child must be 19 or 20 - too old to be cut off from the grandparents.", "I would miss the free cake", "> If you have to just explain to your mum...\n\nNo, OP, you don't need to explain anything to anybody.  It just gives people the chance to JADE you.  \"I decided not to\" is as much of an explanation as you need to give anyone.  You don't need to Justify, Argue, Defend or Explain anything.  If they try to maneuver you into doing so by repeatedly goading you to explain yourself, they are just being manipulative.  Don't fall for it.", "Yes super pricey! 6 hours a day for a year at a modest estimate of $10 an hour is about 15 grand! Location matters of course but that is a ton of lost wages. What an awful sister.", "On a side note, one of my cousins had a wedding where the plates were $350 each. Insanity.  She deliberately chose this for fancy shamacy status versus family\u2026 totally her pejorative. But we have a huge family, so she had tiered invites- plus ones and \u201ckids\u201d (24-18 year old cousins) could come after dinner for dancing. In theory whatever, her wedding, buuut I had been helping elders get seated at their tables so when I got to mine, there was no seat!!!!!!!! I went to make sure I had the right table number and there were about 3 other people doing the same. Wedding planner was having a fit bc people brought their plus ones and adult kids in revolt. They new couple was being introduced and I had to squat at the table while we waited for a chair/table setting to be squished in. And the plus one crashed at my table was so smug. Not even my wedding (and I didn\u2019t agree with the lack of the plus ones on the first place) and I wanted to dump pasta on their head or something.   \nSorry. Back to OP- NTA go on a lovely date night with your partner and don\u2019t think twice about not going!! Self preservation is clutch", "Even at small weddings (like my own,) you typically give plus ones. Really it ends up being very few additional people. Most of your older family is likely married, many of your friends you'll already be friends with their partners and invite them by name. We had a handful of plus one invites, maybe 3 of those people actually used it.", "Chosen family is just as good as any biological connection. Sometimes better \ud83d\ude0a", "Remember that you are not obliged to justify your decision, or explain it, or defend it.  You are not obliged to argue with them.

Have a lovely time!\"\n\n\"You already asked me that and this is not a topic for discussion.\"  *subject change*\n\n\"If you can't stop bringing this up, I'll have to end this call.  Good night.\"", "She had the child when OP was 15 so the kid is 15 since OP is 30 now.", "OP can buy herself a nice cake and stuff her face while enjoying her sister-free day with her boyfriend. Much cheaper and doesn't come with a side of family drama."]}
