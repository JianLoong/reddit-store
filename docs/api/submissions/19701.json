When she got engaged she asked me (30f) to be a bridesmaid approximately a year ago. Recently she gave out her bridesmaid proposal boxes and I did not receive one. I was cut out of the wedding party. I never said anything because personally I feel like it would come across selfish and if she selected people to be apart of her day then so be it. I was hurt though. \n\nA little backstory, my sister and I have history. She has done some very wicked things to me. As example she had a baby when I was 15 YO and told me if I babysat for her everyday after school she would gift me her old car on my 16th bday. Fast forward after babysitting for 6+ hours every day for a year, she sold that car and kept the money and told me to get over it. \n\nMy sister has excluded me from all wedding activities such as dress shopping etc but yet my SIL/Mom/Grandma etc have all been invited. \n\nNow back to the wedding- I recently got the invitation and scanned the QR code to go to her wedding site. Where I discovered that I was excluded from a plus one as well and cannot bring my boyfriend of 2 years. If I were to go to this wedding that I was already de-bridesmaided, I would also have to attend alone. I decided I honestly did not want to go and told my mother. She\u2019s calling me the a hole telling me that I\u2019m going to regret this and it\u2019s ridiculous to not attend over some bad history and \u201cyour boyfriend not being allowed to come\u201d.

But it does sound like your family isn't great at honest communication, and that may be a factor. \n\nIs there a world in which she sent out the bridesmaid proposal boxes and yours got misdirected/overlooked or she assumed that since you'd already committed you didn't expect a box, and because you avoid confrontation you didn't speak up and then she thought your lack of response was declining to participate, and now you're both feeling hurt and betrayed by the other, and her lack of plus one is a childish way to punish you for not being a bridesmaid?\n\nAlso, you're coloring current events with crayons from the past - the mean thing she did at 15 doesn't necessarily mean she's being mean at 35. Could it be? Sure. But she may have matured since then. The point is, you don't know unless you find out where she's coming from, and you should at least know where she's at as you make your decision- not just about the event but about the path your relationship will take.\n\n*Communicate* \\- not with your mom but with your sis. Find out what's up with the de-bridesmaiding and the lack of plus one and invitations to wedding activities. Be non-confrontational but honest about your perception and your feelings and that you want to support her, but are hurt. Hopefully, you can clear the air and it's a misunderstanding that can be fixed. If not, and if it is done out of spite or malice, you'll feel 100% NTA and justified in skipping the event.", "Looks to me she wanted to do more stuff to hurt you. She's going to be annoyed you won't to because she won't looking forward to having the control of making you come solo.

So incredibly shitty and the value of those hours is probably equal to a fairly pricey registry item.", "Absolutely. Which is why I said not going is the right choice.\n\nBut OP even said that this is a case of the last straw. The entire extended family probably doesn't know about all of this history and will only see someone choosing to miss a sibling's major milestone.\n\nAnd missing that milestone might be the end of OP's relationship with their sister. And maybe OP is fine with that. But maybe they aren't.", "I feel like I\u2019ve definitely started to grow and realize it more now than ever. Tis the basis of me not wanting to go to the wedding.
