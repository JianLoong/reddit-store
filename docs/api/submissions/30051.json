He stated multiple times that it wasn't necessary and and that I didn't need to worry because he would just buy a costume this year. Last weekend, he took our son, and he didn't buy him a costume.

AITA for not letting them take him?\n\n***Edit 1: My child is autistic, which is why we don't *just* let him decide. He's 12, but unfortunately isn't capable of clearly stating what he wants to do.\n\n***Edit 2: I'm self-employed and schedule my time carefully, which was why I needed to know days/weeks/months ago what the costume would be, so I could plan to make or order in advance. I also don't have a vehicle, so *just* getting a costume today would require me to not work, and basically spend the day with his Nana, looking for a costume. \n\n***Edit 3: I did not promise the RZ costume to my son repeatedly over months. I mentioned it once to him, his dad shot down the idea, and I only discussed it further with his dad, to verify that if he wanted to go that route, I would need a specific amount of time.

Suddenly it's no longer convenient because you and your partner procrastinated getting your son's costume until the last week before Halloween then decide to cancel *all* of Halloween on your son. He is 12, he is old enough to go to a friend's house and enjoy his Halloween like a proper \"kiddo\" rather than having this fun filled holiday taken away from him because neither of his parents could be bothered to consider his wants in all of this or keep a promise to him.", "YTA.  You have somebody willing to take your son trick or treating and say no because you want to make it about you? Halloween isn't a necessarily a \"family togetherness\" holiday.

But think about what the kiddo will want. At 12 I\u2019m betting a bit of candy even if you don\u2019t trick or treat for very long.", "NTA.  At two, he won't even remember this Halloween.  Stick to your guns - it's going to be cold and snowing and that's no weather for a little kid to be outside in for hours.  Besides, if the weather is that bad, he's going to need a coat and no one would see his costume anyways.\n\nAside from that, stop letting them run your life.  Grandparent here, and your ex inlaw's need some boundaries set now, before things get too out of hand.  Don't let them guilt you.  Movie night with mom is a great way to spend the day.", "I would let him make his own choice, but he's autistic and has difficulty making decisions. The responsibility of making final decisions still rests on us - he's a kid, and shouldn't be burdened with making plans and decisions ahead of time... at this point, *just* letting him go would require me to drop work, my son to skip school, and basically spend the entire day with his Nana, shopping for a costume I really can't afford.", "Thank you. I've been trying to \"split\" the holidays for years. My son's biological father and his family didn't want anything to do with a mixed race child, so my roommate volunteered to be dad. So, I feel like I'm obligated to let them just take him for all the holidays and special events because they were kind enough to \"adopt\" him. There's suppose to be a snowstorm this evening, so I figured I could just get one holiday.", "My son is autistic, so he has difficulty making clear decisions  and stating what he wants, which is why we still have to basically pick his costumes for him. I asked him if he was fine with staying home and watching horror movies and eating candy, and he said yes. I'm mostly irked that after finally deciding against going Trick-or-Treating, and not getting him a costume, now his dad and Nana changed their mind at the last minute ...not even sure I want to ask my son now, as it might just confuse him. Especially if we end up getting a snowstorm and have to cancel anyway.", "I should edit this... My child is autistic, and doesn't really have the normal range of planning skills that a neurotypical child would have. I've asked him what he wants to do. He doesn't seem to care one way or another. It's more that his dad expects me to drop everything and *just* blow off work and throw together a costume.", "No, you're misunderstanding - aside from the first mention of the RZ costume, I haven't mentioned it to my son again, and he hasn't brought it up. I spoke to my son's dad about the costume months ago, and he shot it down then. Then he, and my son looked at costumes for weeks and weeks. I let my son's dad know that I could still make the original costume idea if he wanted to go that route, but gave him a firm deadline. He declined. My son's dad is fully aware that our 12-year-old doesn't have the awareness to make complex plans/decisions like a neurotypical child. We have to help him pick something or he just won't make any kind of decision.", "Since Dad has abruptly decided that they're going trick-or-treating, Dad can deal with finding a costume.", "What are you talking about?  Of course you go to work and he goes to school. You can invite them to go trick or treating with you if you like, but your kid clearly wants to go.\n\n When he gets home, make a costume.  He can be a business man by dressing up a bit, he can be murder victim with a little red food dye, white shirt jeans and a hammer he's a carpenter, white shirt and red hat and he's Ash from pokemon, plaid shirt and a backpack and he's Joel from the Last of Us, get matching colors pants and shirt and add two black stripes with electrical tape around the chest for a crayon, yellow shirt with a stripe and he's Charlie Brown.", "WTF?!?  This needs to be in your original post!!  This man is not even your son's bio father.  You are not obligated to share your son on holidays like this, stop letting these people push you around.  NTA NTA NTA", "Don't let them take those from you.  You are mom and deserve all the time you want.  You want those memories, so keep him and enjoy.  Even start your own traditions!", "My kids are not on the spectrum and don\u2019t plan stuff. It\u2018s not a skill set at this stage for just about anyone in that age group. My son didn\u2019t even pick out his costume, his sister did, because he doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s in it for the running around for a couple hours, candy and then he\u2019ll move on.\n\nWhy do you care what his dad expects? You don\u2019t need to perfect a costume for trick or treating. No one will even notice. If he has anything negative to say ignore it or ask him what he bought.", "NTA, but here's the thing: you care more about his costume than he does. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but you could go to work and then go to any store, buy him one thing, and make that his costume. I know it's not what you want, but you seem to be letting this bother you more than it should.   \n\n\nI think the real issue is that your ex is not communicating with you in the way that you would like. I'm not sure this has anything to do with the Halloween costume. The lack of communication still a valid concern, of course. But you might have to let this one go. If your son really is okay with how the day is going, then your frustration has to be set aside on this one. You're allowed to tell your ex that you're not happy with how things have gone, but he's your ex for a reason, right? He's probably not going to change.", "How's he going to feel tomorrow when all the other kids in his class have lots of candy and talk about trick or treating?  You realize this might be his last chance ever, right?", "If he truly doesn't care, then go forward with your current plans. Ignore your ex. \n\nIf you think your son might care or might be disappointed tomorrow when his friends are talking about Halloween, then do something simple and take him out for an hour. Tape a race number to a hoodie and call him a marathon runner. Give him a paper towel roll and a flannel shirt can call him the brawny paper towl man. Pick up white poster board from a drug store, draw the Ace of Hearts on it, and send him out as a playing card. Stick a \"My name is\" sticker on his shirt and call him Ronald from Jury Duty. \n\nYou can even still do Rob Zombie if you have the hat and a tank top or leather jacket. Just forget about the dreadlocks (it doesn't seem like your kid cares much anyway). \n\nIt doesn't have to be an all day thing that requires you to blow off work and it doesn't need to involve your ex.", "If he doesn't care then why is it a big deal if you say no to his grandparents?", "Ok, there's confusion here ... I homeschool and am self-employed/ work from home, so their EXPECTATION is that I can simply blow all that off and have my son's Nana pick us up to go shopping for a costume, then take us across town to my son's dad, to go Trick-or-Treating there. All during a snowstorm. I would just take him in my area, and have him wear his outfit from last year, but it's not a safe area.", "I love this response."]}
