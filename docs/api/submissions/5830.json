But you\u2019re allowed switch off from that topic because it can become monotonous for you.", "NTA. She is obsessive. Pray she doesn't have fertility problems b/c you will never hear the end of her struggle.", "NAH. Maybe let your sister know that you will be excited when she is pregnant but are having a hard time with all the baby talk and ask if she could tone it down a little.", "NAH \nYour sister is going through one of the happiest periods in her life and is naturally looking to the next big thing in her life. She's excited. She might be a bit self involved but she's sharing her excitement with you. You're obviously very important to her if you're one of the first people she would tell about a pregnancy. \nThe fact you note for yourself that you feel a certain way about her life direction in comparison to your own, indicates that you might just be projecting a bit. If you continue to feel bitter or envious then it will eventually sour your relationship with your sibling.", "NTA but how freaking annoying. She\u2019s not even trying yet!!! It sounds like there\u2019s something deeply wrong in her life that she needs to keep bringing this up. How is her relationship with her husband? Maybe he\u2019s not as in lard as she\u2019s leading people to believe and she\u2019s trying to make this more real and exciting for herself.", " NAH. She's just excited and trying to include you, her sister.", "NTA for being annoyed, but you do sound very jealous and how you are handling it like an AH which is sad because you actually could talk to her about how you'd rather not talk about babies all the time, but instead you are choosing to ignore her while still making her think it's okay and that you don't resent her as much as you do for being the \"golden child\" (as evidenced by her saying \"her husband and me are gonna be the first people she tells\").", "ESH\n\nYour sister is getting overzealous about her planned pregnancy. She might plan to start trying to get pregnant in March...but she might not get pregnant until March 2025!\n\nIt is annoying, but you are not setting boundaries for her, which is your fault. Just tell her you are tired of all these castles in the air and don't want to hear about them until she IS pregnant.", "YTA. Sounds to me like sister is seeking your approval for some reason.", "ESH- she\u2019s going overboard talking about it, but you\u2019re right, you should be excited for her and do sound jealous she\u2019s \u201cgot it all together\u201d", "YTA, she\u2019s not talking about a baby she doesn\u2019t have yet, she\u2019s talking about getting pregnant and that whole process, which are all normal things to consider before trying for a baby. \n\nYou say she\u2019s the golden child, in what way? Did your parents favorite her? Was she unkind to you growing up? Bc if not, then it sounds like you have some insecurities to work through that aren\u2019t her fault. \n\nIt\u2019s a new and exciting time in her life and it sounds like she just wants to share that with you. My partner and I have different interests and passionately talk about them to each other. I frankly don\u2019t have a big interest in the upgrades he makes to his car (as in I wouldn\u2019t seek this info out if it wasn\u2019t for him) but I love him, and love listening to him talk about the things that interest him. And in a way that makes me interested too, and I\u2019ve learned a lot from him. I know that he doesn\u2019t care that much about the fantasy series I\u2019m reading but he listens and asks questions bc it\u2019s interesting to me, and we are two people that care about each other.", "Nta", "NTA.

Just because someone wants to share their excitement with you doesn't mean you have to agree to listen. The notion you are required to listen  and be the sounding board for your sister's excitement about trying to get pregnant is ridiculous. You are not her partner. If she really feels the need to ramble on about trying to get pregnant that should be something you she can share with her partner or a friend. Sharing DNA does not mean you are required to listen or care about anything going on in her life. You were happy to listen the first few times, but even the best of friends would get annoyed if that is all the person can seem to talk about."]}
