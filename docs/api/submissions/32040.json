OP thinks her parents convinced her sister that it was traumatic to be kidnapped. I am unsure as to how reliable OP is in terms of diagnosing why her sister is struggling right now. Maybe it was the parents, maybe it's the trauma, maybe it's the emergence of a mental illness since she's also at the right age for that. OP doesn't seem particularly close which is their prerogative but I would treat \"what they did to her sister\" with a grain of salt, considering how dismissive she is of what we can both agree is the MOST egregious transgression here (kidnapping)."]}
