Was your mom wrong it what she did, obviously yes, and she paid the price for it. You were lucky enough to be old enough to understand what was going on around you. Your sister, unfortunately, was not. \n\nYou Dad and stepmom have done her a serious disservice and unless she gets intensive therapy, now. She'll never be able to function. \n\nDo not enable this behavior. No college prof is going to let mommy help her with her exams.

You're grown, probably working your own job, having your own friends and taking care of your own home or saving up to get your own place at this point.

I have many opinions, but I'll keep it short and to the point: NTA for not babysitting your sister! That girl likely needs professional help! See that your father and stepmom find someone for her, because nothing about this situation is sustainable either for your family as a whole nor for your sister in particular.\n\n(But also keep in mind that your sister is only 18 years old and maybe just needs a bit more time to get into this whole adult-responsibility-thing.
