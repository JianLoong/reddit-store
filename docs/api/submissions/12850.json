{"id": 12850, "submission_id": "11xo6ej", "title": "AITA for asking our neighbors to turn off lights at night", "selftext": "We live in a rural area away from city lights. We built our house with three 6-foot tall glass panels (one is a door) in our second floor bedroom face the woods so we could enjoy the view from bed and have the door to the deck open in the summer.\n\nSeveral years ago a new house was built 400 feet behind ours on the property next door. When the current owners moved in in 2021, I greeted them with a warm mulberry cobbler. I also explained that their outdoor lights would shine into our bedroom at night. My request was that they shut them off when they go to bed -- which fell on deaf ears.\n\nA couple months later, after one of their dogs attacked ours ($535 emergency vet visit for a deep puncture wound that they did pay for), I mentioned the lights again. She said that they live far off the \"street,\" it gets very dark at night (duh!), and their kids sleep on the front side of the house. Then she suggested we get window treatments (at a cost that would be around $650 to match the wood blinds we have).\n\nThen the holidays roll around, and they have lights installed around all of the eves on their house and shed. It's lit up like a nuclear plant; you could probably see it from space! Even one of our other neighbors wondered how we liked living next to the airport. So, at 4 o'clock in the morning I sent her a text with a picture from our bedroom saying the lights looked nice, and asked if they needed to be on all night as they light up our bedroom.\n\nHer response: \"Lights really seem to be an issue for you. They are Christmas lights -- Millions of people have them.  I don't believe there is a law against having them.\"\n\nMy suggestion was to put them on a timer so they'd go off at bedtime. Again, she was prickly...\n\n\"I will see if I can put them on a timer.  But I don't understand why I'm the only one that needs to make changes.  Why are you always asking us to not have lights on when you still must not have window treatments if they're still bothering you?  If the roles were reversed and your lights were bothering me, I personally would just get blinds vs asking you to make a change to your way of living.\n\n\"I just feel like from day one you've got on us about our lights.  I too moved out to the country to be able to live freely and I feel like I've got more restrictions now than I did when I lived in a neighborhood.\n\n\"I will see if I can get them on a timer, but I can't possibly keep restricting my families way of living for one person.\"\n\nThe lights were put on a timer to go off at 11:30 PM, and came back on at 5 AM. That was in 2021. This last holiday season, they went off at midnight and came back on at 4:30 AM. Sometimes the lights on the shed would stay on all night. They don't have the lights taken down own until the beginning of February. \n\nI've always been civil with them, and even took a bottle of champagne over around New Years the first year to thank them for using a timer.\n\nThey still leave the lights on all night on the front of their house and shed.  \ud83d\ude15\n\nAITA for wanting to sleep in the dark?", "created_utc": 1679420318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xo6ej/aita_for_asking_our_neighbors_to_turn_off_lights/", "score": 510, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Timers for Christmas lights also seems reasonable, but since it's a temporary part of the year, I wouldn't be as concerned about it as the other lights. \n\nDo your neighbor's *have* to honor your requests? Of course not, but refusing to make some easy adjustments to improve your quality of living seems like an AH move to me.\n\nI'd say continue trying to kill them with kindness.

Wtf?", "You deserve this award. Excellent thinking for a solution that helps everyone.", "Before they moved in, we paid to have a double row of trees planted along the property line.

I grew up in pretty real Saint Francis county.  And there was a lot of ordinances about light pollution but that may be on the city level not the county", "Agreed. We\u2019re all just speculating here because OP won\u2019t answer the question.", "Yeah then I'm p sure she's just bitter that other people moved somewhat near her place.", "I'm old enough not to give a rip what they think of me.

They're nice enough people; keep to themselves, but not someone I would socialize with", "The trees were 15' tall. You can't move mature trees.\n\nSo they can come in and sh!t on our lives (it's not just the lights--noise, dogs on our property) , but as soon as I ask them to stop I'm the AH?", "Don\u2019t forget she also BID ON THAT PROPERTY before she was out bid. Sounds like princess is just being petty at this point", "Lol. I guess your mom raised you to think that being an entitled busybody is something all country people enjoy and value.

Leave them alone.", "Lol I wonder what \"they'd\" say about a grown adult whining about Christmas lights", "Yes bc being a petty AH is the solution. You could just hang up blinds.", "The house is 400 feet away according to OP. Including both end zones in an American football field, that's 360 feet.  So it's a long distance.", "Lol yes. Bc a lawyer contacting them about them leaving their lights on at their own house won\u2019t escalate things at all.

This is also beneficial to you for saving money on heating and cooling!", "Go back to work so you can afford some curtains, then.", "Why can't you get blinds?", "Then you made your choice, why are you still complaining? Either get some curtains or get over it. This is entirely a you problem and not your neighbors problem to solve.

Very different.", "So why are you behaving as if you have rights to it?\n\n\nThey rightly own the property and are keeping to themselves.

They did their part of putting on a timer. You can do your part of getting darker curtains or blinds.", "Ah, there's the source of the resentment. You're being the toxic, unpleasant neighbor that is a staple of this sub. Congratulations I guess?", "Are you able the answer the blind-question? Or is that to complicated for you?", "That's life, right?", "So you can afford to bid on the land, but you can't afford window treatments?", "So use the money you would have spent on that property to buy some blackout blinds.", "And then the neighbors can do something similar and they can just go in circles with who is being more childish.", "21", "Unfortunately aesthetic is a privilege that most people can\u2019t afford and don\u2019t have.

I also have 6ft windows. I went on Amazon got black out curtains with a rod for $50 per window. I even got a little motor that I can open my curtains in the morning without getting out of bed. This is a problem that is easily fixed by YOU getting window treatments, NOT your neighbor having to turn off their lights.", "seriously, OP.  i get the whole \"love of natural light\" but you're acting like your windows are impossible to cover.  they're 6 feet  (72\") and standard long curtain lengths are 84\".   6 curtain panels and the appropriate hanging hardware will run you about $200.", "She won\u2019t reply to any suggestions about blackout curtains, but is dying on the hill of $650 window tint.", "Doesn't want to see it.

You do realise you're not royalty, right?", "I feel like if the neighbors are doing things *on their property* that bother you, it's up to you to find an acceptable solution, not your neighbors responsibility to stop whatever bothers you. I get that it's annoying. I have neighbors that play music every time they're outside. It's not overly loud but sound travels.\n\nIf their dogs routinely go on your property, that's a different situation, but your gripe you came here about is lights.

Seriously. There are a million other horror stories on reddit to illustrate that. \n\nThey're definitely assholes, and are probably the type paranoid about \"security\" and deterring burglars, even though the chance of one coming all the way out there to rob them is slim. I don't think you'll be able to change their minds, wether you blast music or not. More likely you'll both just retaliate back and forth until you're both twice as miserable as you are now. \n\nJust do what's in your control, and buy the damn blackout curtains for your room.
