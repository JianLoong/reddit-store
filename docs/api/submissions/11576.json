We were really exited to see all the sights, especially some of the older historical buildings.\n\nAt this really old church we wanted to go into, they explained my sister could not without changing because of the dress code. She'd have to cover her hair with this shawl thing they had, wear this wrap around skirt over her pants, and wear long sleeves. Well apparently she decided she was too good for that, and she rufused to go in at all. I was pissed.\n\nI went back to the hotel, got the next ticket home, packed, and left without telling her. I texted her once before I got on the plane so she'd know where I was, but that was it. I'm not gonna go on a trip with someone who disrespects local cultures, and acts like every bad American stereotype. \n\nOur parents reamed me when I got home, saying I was being terrible for leaving her for the last week of the trip alone (we'd only been there two days). But she's an adult, if she wants to be so disrespectful of other cultures, she can fly home alone.

Nope. \nYTA for writing such a dumb scenario.\nEDIT: to show correct time they saved", "YTA. Why on earth do you think you\u2019re owed an apology? Because *you* chose to cut *your* trip short? Are you the human embodiment of French culture?\n\nYou saved for ages and ages to even go on the trip, but could change your flight home just like that?

For leaving your sister and also making France seems like a backward ass culture where we hate women on reddit. It's litteraly only that one place (it's the sacr\u00e9 c\u0153ur in Paris isn't it?). Your sister was right to feel insulted by it, it's insulting.

She didn't even disrespect any customs, she just decided to not take part in them, nothing wrong with that. Disrespect would have been to not obey the dress code but go in anyway. YTA and you'd better apologize for disrespecting her freedom of religion, which actually is kind of a big deal in France.", "YTA talk about overreacting", "So your parents paid for the trip clearly. YTA", "YTA - she didn't disrespect anyone, she respected the dress code by waiting outside. You then threw a fit over her not doing what you wanted and you left her in a bad situation.", "You threw a hissy fit and left the trip? And you think she was disrespectful? No. She chose not to go into one particular place but you could have still gone in. And then you think she would have deserved something bad happening to her after you abandoned her without even a warning? And somehow you justify this bc she wouldn\u2019t follow a particular dress code for one church? She didn\u2019t ruin the trip. You did. I would be ashamed of my son if he did this to one of his sisters. YTA", "YTA She didn't go in! Disrespecting would have been storming past security without following the dress code!

She doesn't go in and you can go in alone or you can both go somewhere else. Not going in does not mean disrespecting anything or anyone. If she yelled at people, ran inside, and spit on the floor, sure. That's disrespectful. Declining to enter when asked to change is not disrespectful.\n\nThen you're so upset that you leave your sister, barely majority age, alone in another country for a week and you want an apology from her?

Which... She still did. By choosing to not go in she was still showing respect of those customs because she did not throw a fit nor did she insist she went in dressed the way she already was. It is okay to be uncomfortable with the way someone else does something, and leaving can be a perfect way of handling that. She did absolutely nothing wrong. She didn't act like a bad American stereotype (frankly how brash you're being feeds into them more), she respect both her boundaries and the boundaries of those you had interacted with (telling someone their customs make them uncomfortable is not disrespectful. It would be disrespectful if she said it was wrong or bad or gross or whatever to do so, but she didn't, she simply set a boundary. She didn't say it should make you uncomfortable to, she said an \"I\" statement). \n\nEven if she wasn't completely respectful, you still shouldn't have left her there without telling her (telling her after you've already left doesn't really help that much. Though that can also depend on how fast the process was). She's in a different country, now without any form of support system, that is terrifying when you are not prepared for it? Does she have experience traveling on her own already? If she doesn't what you did is extra bad, if she does well it's not as awful but it's still not an okay thing to do because being left in an unfamiliar place with no warning is still a jarring experience. Especially when nothing gets fully explained to you in an actual understandable manner. \n\nAlso what? You want an apology? You do not deserve one! First off, you are the one who left her in an unfamiliar environment with zero wanting. Not the other way around. You are the one who owes her an apology. Second off, you wouldn't deserve an apology even if she was actually somewhat disrespectful because she was in no way disrespectful to you, she was disrespectful to others, they would be the ones deserving of an apology not you. If she was disrespectful you'd be more in need of an explanation and remorse, which again, you're no entitled to that in this situation, she is!", "YTA \n\nThis is so ridiculous.

You, on the other hand, threw an absolute fit, lost your mind and LEFT YOUR 18 YEAR OLD SISTER IN ANOTHER COUNTRY BY HERSELF.\n\nYou also seem to have a bit of a savior complex going on.  You are going to save those poor Europeans from having to deal with the entitled American.  How very kind of you.  I am relatively sure they don't need your help, but thanks anyway, I guess?\n\nYTA, and so much more.  It would be a shame if your family did to you what you did to your sister and abandons you.  Well, not really.", "I think you are both idiots. You ruined your own trip over her dumb but otherwise legit reason. What an insane waste of money.

She wasn\u2019t disrespecting the culture; it\u2019s not like she went in still after refusing to cover up. If she didn\u2019t want to cover up and didn\u2019t go inside then I don\u2019t see a problem. To me, it seems more like a religious thing than a cultural thing too. I\u2019m sure they have very similar churches in America. Not that I tolerate disrespect towards religions anyway but I\u2019m just pointing it out in the sense of how you\u2019re saying she\u2019s acting like a bad American stereotype. \nYou\u2019re saying she\u2019s an adult which like ok, legally she is but she\u2019s also still a TEENAGER. Just because you\u2019re 18 doesn\u2019t mean you should be able to navigate the world by yourself. You are a horrible brother for leaving her in a foreign country by herself and even more of an AH for expecting to be the one who is owed an apology.

We were really exited to see all the sights, especially some of the older historical buildings.\n\nAt this really old church we wanted to go into, they explained my sister could not without changing because of the dress code. She'd have to cover her hair with this shawl thing they had, wear this wrap around skirt over her pants, and wear long sleeves. Well apparently she decided she was too good for that, and she rufused to go in at all. I was pissed.\n\nI went back to the hotel, got the next ticket home, packed, and left without telling her. I texted her once before I got on the plane so she'd know where I was, but that was it. I'm not gonna go on a trip with someone who disrespects local cultures, and acts like every bad American stereotype. \n\nOur parents reamed me when I got home, saying I was being terrible for leaving her for the last week of the trip alone (we'd only been there two days). But she's an adult, if she wants to be so disrespectful of other cultures, she can fly home alone. She hasn't spoken to me since she got home, which is fine since all I want is an apology.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What about this is \"prudish\"?", "Prudish? That would be the opposite of not wanting to be more covered when entering that church. And she is certainly not an asshole for making that choice **for herself** and then saying she was not going to go in. Like OP couldn't visit the inside of the church alone?", "Do you have any idea what prudish means? Bc this suggests you do not.", "How is this prudish..? You also have to remember you\u2019re going by OP rendition of this and he seems like a major AH. Seems more likely she just didn\u2019t want to go through with all that and just said \u201cnah it\u2019s\u201d. The prudish thing would to be going in anyway, or making a big scene about it, or abandoning her brother in France for a week.", "even if she made a scene, leaving his sister alone in europe for a week is still a massive asshole move", "I mean I get it because I\u2019m not usually comfortable wearing clothes a place has given me. I don\u2019t know how well or how regularly they wash them, and I have some fear around that because I am immunocompromised. Especially more recently with Covid. A bit irrational sure, but unless it\u2019s a place I really need to go to, I usually just decline and not enter or do the activity.", "I was thinking this. Sister was probably thrilled.", "Right? It has to be. If it\u2019s not\u2026 sheesh.", "Oof what a waste of money, and leaving a teenager alone in a different country over a tantrum?? Doble oof \n\nYTA and very impulsive", "Yes. This. Never seen head scarves required in a French church.", "Also the trip was in the winter - I doubt his sister was showing excessive amounts of skin.", "Rude and childish would be standing there demanding to be let in regardless of the dress code. Choosing to walk away instead of making herself uncomfortable was the most adult thing she could have done while respecting herself as well.", "This blew my mind.  That you\u2019d save and look forward to a trip for so long only to cut it short by a week?! Like didn\u2019t OP want to see France??  He was so angry that she made a different decision than he would have that he punished *both* her and himself?  \nOP, you have serious anger issues, and YTA.", "OP is definitely TA.  But his sister actually wasn't disrespectful.  She didn't go in.  She respected that there was a dress code, declined it, and remained outside.", "Bruh...now I hope this post is fake. No way is someone that heartless.", "Into a trip that they spent *years* saving for. Like, I\u2019m not even sure what that would be supposed to accomplish. \u201cI\u2019ll show you\u2026 by ruining my own vacation?\u201d", "2 words - Bed bugs"]}
