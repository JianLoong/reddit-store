You weren't trying to \"make it about you\", you were only trying to relate to him. Unfortunately, because you abandoned that child he is going to have bad feelings about you whether or not you like it. And that does not make him an AH, that is a normal reaction. These are the consequences of your actions whether or not you like it. Maybe just apologise and move on. It really seems like neither of you want a relationship.", "Whew, alot of adoption shit on AITA lately.\n\nAn adoptee here YNTA. I am also reunited w biomom.\n\nIt's hard to navigate adoption reunion, and neither of you are AH. He's valid in his confusion/rejection and you are valid in your autonomy. Could you have just been kinder, for sure. He's also 18, which is really still a kid. Sometimes adoptees just want to convey hurt, (understandable, but other people are not outlets for pain) show they are real people and impress upon biomoms that they are real actual people who were given away.\n\nThe problem with adoption reunion is expectation, unconscious or otherwise. Neither party actually being prepared to meet emotionally/psychologically. He was abandoned, that is real for him. You didnt want a kid, that is real for you. Neither doing the emotional work before meeting to have true empathy/healing/knowing how reunion can amplify feelings.\n\nIf you feel bad and feel up to it, maybe just reiterate that you don't want a relationship and share information about his father with him (what music he liked/etc) medical history. Even honestly some facts about yourself. When I met my bio mom I was prepared and ready to be kind, but even just knowing details about her really took some of the pain of not knowing away. If you need to talk DM me, I can recommend some books on how adopting out a kid brings shame/healing or put you in touch with my bio mom to help you realize you have nothing to be ashamed about, be kind to yourself. But also maybe try to understand where he was coming from as well. Not easy to not know where you came from or feel like you aren't good enough. Even if adopted family is a happy one it doesnt discount the trauma being adopted brings. Sending good vibes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEditing to add: Most male adoptees dont seek out bioparents until middle age statistically. If he found you being that young, asking about mental health. He might really be struggling. Could be where some of the feelings come from. Hope he has a good support system.", "Nah. You are two humans navigating a difficult at best issue.

My mom abandoned me when I was pretty young and it\u2019s extremely difficult to deal with.

It usually gives them a better life. You should have not met up at all or at least given him comforting words. There is no reason to say what you said other than selfishness and bitterness.\n\nEdit: one last thing, you made the decision to have a baby. Whether you wanted one or not. Bringing him into the world was not his choice and you basically blamed his own birth on him.", "NAH.\n\nYou both were forced into awful situations neither wanted to be in and as a result any communication between both of you is plagued with tension and aggression on both ends. You were honest about your feelings towards your son from the jump and you did what you thought was best for him in the moment, but your son is also valid in his resentment towards you for that.

He sounds like he\u2019s reeling from 18 years of pain, and I genuinely hope he gets support and help through it.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t want a relationship, but he is also the one that reached out to you. Hopefully, now that time has passed, your relationship between each other can eventually mend, if it will heal you both.\n\nThe only AH here is your late husband, for doing this to both of you.", "NTA \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut he sounds like he's had a stressful time and assumes you've just abandoned him, actually meeting you overwhelmed him, he probably doesn't want to hear an explanation after 18 years of wondering why you decided to give him up", "NTA it sounds like he needs some help to get through whatever trauma he has from being adopted but that's not your responsibility. Imo you did the right thing. You didn't want a child and weren't prepared or mentally able to raise one. I hope you don't blame yourself too much for this interaction, as his view of you from the beginning makes me believe he wouldn't have liked anything you said regardless.", "This is a hard one. You gave him up for adoption. When he reached out to you, you agreed to see him. Not surprisingly,  he's very angry with you. Rather than deflect his anger, you told him the truth: that you were not prepared to have a child. \n\nI think that where things went astray was in your telling him that you wanted an abortion. That guarantees a negative response.  Who wants to be told that they should have been aborted? The kinder response would have been to skip over the decision to abort and, instead, to focus on your inability to raise him. That puts his existence in a more positive light and focuses on the fact that (whether or not you wanted to abort him) he's better off with his adopted family. \n\nI don't think that you were malicious.  But I can't blame him for being angry. NAH", "Gentle YTA for saying you never wanted to be a mother and did kinda make it about yourself. There\u2019s nothing wrong with not wanting children and I am sorry you were coerced into having one. But, he already knows that and was already on the defensive and probably angry about the whole situation (which is also perfectly valid.)

You should have just let him leave when the purpose of the meeting was over.", "NAH i think\nFor checking medical backgrounds you don't need to meet & i think it would went way smoother via email.\nBoth of you have valid emotions and I don't think it was wrong to tell him you never wanted to be a mother.

What\u2019s done is done. He made up his mind before he got there that you abandoned him. At this point it really doesn\u2019t matter why. You told him the truth. Now it\u2019s his to do what he wants with it.  I would consider in future, if he contacts you with family questions, to answer via email or text only. And limit the conversations to the matter at hand. Neither of you are interested in reuniting, and you know this, so give yourself a little bit of grace here. He will have to deal with his anger and resentment on his own, and you will have to do the same with your emotions. This is a difficult situation with no rule book to follow. You were both doing the best you could. Try to be at peace with it all and move forward.", "NTA \n\nIf you\u2019re old enough and brave enough to reach out to a parent that put you up for adoption or abandoned you, you should be both of those things to get the answer that they give. \n\nYou were forced into a pregnancy and child that you didn\u2019t want. You did the best thing by giving him to a family who wanted him and love him. He should be happy he was cared enough to receive that treatment. \n\nSome kids get left in foster homes or in some countries sold into servitude or worse. \n\nHe\u2019s going to college.

He may want a connection but if you don\u2019t he has to respect it.", "I would say YTA and NTA at the same time from two perspectives: on one hand you're NTA because you were just trying to explain your situation rightfully so. Even if he didn't say it, I'm sure he wanted a reason as to why he was given up for adoption and you gave him that answer. On the other hand, I would say YTA because of your delivery. The wording \"having a child I never wanted\" probably cut deep as he's probably already struggled all his life not feeling adequate enough to be wanted. But don't beat yourself up too much. We're all human and you were young and did the best you thought you could have done for yourself AND him at the time. You could have said what you mentioned, \"I'm sorry, but at the time I wasn't ready for a child and knew I wouldn't be able to love you the way you deserved and that wasn't fair to you.\" At the end of the day, he also was being a little hostile (understandably so), and it wasn't helpful for a productive conversation.", "NTA, you went and answered his questions. You didn\u2019t have to do that, but did it out of kindness, much like the adoption. He may not understand it now, but you made the right choice for you and him in the long run.", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why he\u2019d reach out or take the effort to find you if he wasn\u2019t interested in a relationship with you. What did he hope to gain? \n\nProud of you for responding to him and be willing to meet with him. Also for the record, you didn\u2019t abandon him as other comments have mentioned. You gave him an opportunity to have a better life than you could have provided. There\u2019s no shame in not wanting to be a mother.

Sounds like your son is more mature at his age than you are at yours. You've had 18 years to deal with giving up a child. The statement of your 18-year-old son that it is not uncommon for children to inherit biological traits from his biological parents is in no means aggressive or unexpected. You could have reacted better to that. And you had 18!!! years to come up with a little more empathetic statement about the reason why you gave up your child. Such as: your father died while I was pregnant and I was unable to give you what you deserved in life at that point.\n\nYou did make it all about you and made yourself the victim, while YOU were the only person in the room who actually made the choices that affected both of you.", "NAH, could you have handled this better? Yes. But honestly, this doesn't make you an asshole. It was a difficult situation for both of you. \n\nBeing an asshole entails a certain amount of malice or obliviousness to other people's needs.

There is no right thing you can say to someone who will find fault with anything and everything you say. And because he doesn't want a relationship, he was likely always going to find reasons to reject you to maintain distance.\n\nHe was likely never going to be open to anything that might make him sympathetic to you because he wants his narrative that you abandoned him just to be cruel and evil, not that you gave him up because you felt unable to do right by him and had just lost your husband.\n\nHe wasn't open to listening or hearing your side.\n\nAnd I can understand that being overwhelming for you because when we feel unfairly judged, we want to protest and express our side and be heard. You felt like he was making you into a monster that you feel you are not and the way you said it wasn't necessarily what you meant and may have been hurtful, but you felt like you were just protecting yourself.\n\nI think MOSTLY this is just a tough situation all around but that over all, he was the AH here because you can't come in expressing that you hate someone and criticise everything they say and expect them to just sit and take it and not find it distressful or upsetting. He's not the only one with feelings here.", "Gentle YTA. I think this is an extremely difficult situation, and you are both completely valid in your feelings.

And looking back as an 18-year-old, such an adoptee is far more likely to feel personally rejected and abandoned than one who was adopted out immediately.\n\nNone of this is to say you made the wrong decision, or did anything maliciously. It's clear that you were coerced into having a child that you were in no way prepared to raise.

Meeting in person might just be too much for both of you right now.", "Where did it say that the son experienced life win an adoptive fam to be better?", "Where does it say she was assaulted. I can see the coercion but where is the assault?", "Everyone who gives a baby up for adoption is a bit responsible for the kid\u2019s trauma. They created the situation.

And not because  they were an addict, or because  they were poor, but SPECIFICALLY because  they didn't want you. After caring for you your first year of life. I mean, holy shit.

That is a huge punch to the gut. \n\nAnd here are the top definitions for the word \"abandon\": \n\n\na: to give up to the control or influence of another person or agent\n\nb:\u00a0to give up with the intent of never again claiming a right or interest in\n\nShe abandoned him. She didn't  leave him on the side of the road, but she gave up all interest and care for her 1 year old child. He has every right to feel how he feels, it's a perfectly valid feeling based on what actually  happened. I mean, no accolades for making sure he was being taken care of before fucking off out of his life.\n\nAnd bottom line, the main takeaway  from this sad story should  be for couples  with mismatched goals and interests  regarding  having children  SHOULD  STOP FUCKING EACH OTHER AND BREAK UP.  Because any children born into those couplings  are the ones who pay the price for their irresponsible, short sighted parents bullshit.", "I absolutely agree, it can be traumatising, but it can also be traumatising to be left in the hands of parents who do not want a child, or who are drug addicts, or mentally/physically incapable of caring for a child.\n\nIn the end it's a case of \"the smallest evil\". There is no good situation, but at least with adoption there's the possibility of a caring home, as opposed to an abusive or neglectful one.\n\nNot to minimise your trauma, but I have to assume that feelings of abandonment are better than growing up abused?", "OP absolutely did the right thing. She knew that she didn't have it in her to give that boy the upbringing and attention he deserved, so she put him up for adoption earlier rather than later. There was no winning here.

It might have been painful to hear, but it really sounds like this is how she's feeling, she's legitimately sorry that she didn't want him and couldn't love him the way he deserved.

Several of my relatives are also adoptees (fertility issues ran on both sides of my adoptive parents\u2019 families) and I can only think of one that has ever expressed any sort trauma surrounding her adoption and it\u2019s because her parents hid the fact she was adopted until she was a teen, which\u2026 yeah, obviously that\u2019s a traumatic thing to discover at 15. \n\nI\u2019m always shocked and disheartened by the growing narrative that adoption is always some sort of terrible, awful thing. It\u2019s not. In many cases, it\u2019s a blessing that saves lives.

There is always some resentment that festers and few get past it. I have a friend who was just around 40 when she remarried.  She had been married very young the first time and had a baby girl who was 20 yrs old when she remarried. She thought her child bearing days were long gone but then 2nd husband kept pushing her to get pregnant.  She didn't want another child but she felt it was wrong to deny him the opportunity to have a child of his own so she got pregnant.  Of course,  she was the one who stayed home and took the main responsibility for raising the child. In a twist, her 20+yr old daughter also got pregnant and there were mere weeks between when each child was born. She became a 2nd time mother and grandmother all at once.\n\nFast forward when the child is around 7yrs old and extremely attached to her mother and distant towards the father...he had been more of an observer than a participant and naturally the daughter was stuck like velcro to her mother. I know them both well and he spoke to me about how he felt like an outsider with them against him all the time. Not surprisingly it eventually ended in divorce and the mother and daughter moved away so she could be closer to her 1st daughter.  He paid child support but never took much interest in the daughter until she turned 18 who started to go to visit him for a couple of weeks at a time. Now in defense of the mother, she was a fabulous mother and certainly didn't give less to her 2nd daughter. Whether she was secretly annoyed about being dumped full time with a child she didn't really want to have, it's possible but I never saw it. They appeared to have a very good relationship. \n\nPresent day the second daughter is older and has 2 kids of her own: she has developed a relationship with her father and goes on 2wk holidays to see him a couple times a year. But since her initial visits when she was younger, she has started complaining to him about her mother. This has become a thing between the two of them...talk trash about the mother.  I don't know if she does it to win favor with her Dad but he always reports those mean remarks to our inner circle of friends,  which makes us uncomfortable.  I'm sure he has said to her that her mother never wanted another baby and he's the reason for her existence. It's so unfair because in truth she  had these baby to please him, she threw her everything into raising her and being an excellent SAHM.  She was so hands own, always creating home crafts or off for scientific moments. She home schooled her for many years until they changed location and she had access to better schools. By  the time she was 6yrs old, she spoke 3 or 4 languages.  Now she has a contentious relationship with her mother because of all the negative shit her Dad is spoon feeding her.  I really think unless two people really want a child they shouldn't do it.  Never have a baby when you don't want to ladies...and men. It almost never ends well.  Don't bring another life into this world unless you 100% want it and are ready to spend the next 35 yrs caring for it.  I say this because my own son is 35 yrs old and as a mother, I never stop caring for him even if he lives in a different city, is successful and happy. We chat everyday and our relationship is great. My point is, responsibility and caring don't stop at 18, it is a lifetime commitment and you better make sure you are 100% ready to make this commitment before you get pregnant.\n\nOP screwed up in being pressured to have a child but she was brave enough to realize she couldn't handle a child on her on.  NTA, she did what she thought was best and has been honest with him. He is angry because he hoped to hear there was some tragic excuse why she had to give him up and that she regretted her decision every day. That is why he is angry.

OP's son isn't pining for her,and I'm not pining for my bio-parents.

I'm not against adoption in the least - but I do have an issue with people who aren't aren't adopted saying the kid was wrong to feel like he does.\n\nMy Mom died this spring.

Obviously that wasn\u2019t her son\u2019s fault and ideally something she could\u2019ve processed in therapy before meeting him rather than publicly but I think you should remember she is a human being with trauma too.", "Yeah, I get why so many people are giving you a pass because giving up a child for adoption when you don't want them is almost always the best move, but even if he doesn't remember it, the psychological and mental development that babies go through in the first year of life is astonishing. So the fact that his parents, the two people his tiny baby brain had imprinted on as his caregivers and basically his entire world, up and disappeared in no time at all, is undeniably a deeply traumatic thing for a child to experience. \n\nTo add literal insult to injury by telling him that you never wanted him is a BRUTAL way of explaining how you really felt. To have to deal with the psychological fallout of understanding that your biological mother never wanted you, that he was probably wanted by his father, and that his father died and you had no problem giving him up after having him for that long is a LOT for a person to deal with, and he's a teenager. I get that you were in a difficult situation, but to say that to him is something that will stick with him for the rest of his life, and even if you apologize you don't get a takeback.

Many are acting like he never bonded with her, which he did. I commend her for understanding that she was not up to raising a child that she obviously resented. And rather than possibly harming him by action or inaction, she chose the better path by putting him up for adoption.

He had an idea in his mind of what she was like and made it so she fit that idea. He was already being very rude with the eye rolling and he knew it.

Especially since he\u2019s the one who reached out to her first. If he only wanted to know medical info then he could have done that over the phone or by email. Generally when you meet a stranger for the first time people usually try and be polite. This kid didn\u2019t do that. He reached out to her but was not at all courteous and I believe, was looking for a confrontation. That being said, I understand that he is hurt himself and is angry. He probably was not ready for this conversation and he probably should\u2019ve waited until he was older. He probably needs a therapist to help work through his adoption trauma.

Now, I'm not saying it's the truth, because a Volleyball scholarship to a specific school is not genetic, but I bet it felt true to him.

After getting to know her, it was apparent that there was no remorse or emotional pain, on her part, for haven given me up.  And no, it wasn\u2019t \u201chidden under the surface\u201d.  I\u2019ve known her for 20 years now\u2026 absolutely no emotions whatsoever regarding my adoption.", "Also it was a year not immediately which I think makes a difference tbh.", "Honest question, why do you think this makes a difference? Not being an asshole, being serious, is this an emotional feeling on your part or something you know from scientific research?", "What are you saying?  That it is surprising he held feelings of anger?  Because although some adoptees may not feel anger, many do and it's a completely understandable thing to feel.", "Yeah, it's being responsible. If you have a broken limb and I leave you at a hospital, that's not abandonment, that's just placing you with the correct personnel to fix the problem.", "It's my own anecdotal evidence as to why its not \"not surprising\".  I understand that some adoptees would harbor anger or resentment; it would be \"surprising\" if those already angry individuals wanted to meet their bios in a restaurant instead of a simple email.  If he was angry before, nothing she could do short of groveling at his feet would appease him.  If the way she conducted herself/responded to him was the thing that enraged him, then she's not likely to be able to give him what he thinks he deserves.", "As an adopted kid, I can say that even when your parent goes through the system for adoption you still end up in foster care.\n\nThe Foster family takes temporary guardianship (I still have a close relationship with my foster mom J) while the system and the court work to find you a good match. I was in foster care for about a year before my adoption went through. \n\nSo \"giving him up\" would lead to adoption. In his case another family did go through the process to become his legal guardian. As it sounds like he didn't age out of the system but instead contacted her through some type of mediation service. \n\nAlthough if OP reads this and corrects me I'll gladly edit.\n\nMany people in the community use the terminology \"gave up\" because that is what they legally die. Gave you up to the system and gave up legal guardianship to someone else.", "I took her being pressured into having a kid she didn't want as meaning she got pregnant on purpose at his insistence. Do we know if this was actually an accidental pregnancy situation? Cause that would make more sense. The main fault I found with OP was intentionally getting pregnant in the first place, when she knows she wouldn't love and care the child.", "What part of this makes it sound like she bonded with him? You realize some people can create a human, keep it alive for a year, try their best to actually love it, and still never get there. It happens, probably more than we know since most people are too terrified to admit that they don\u2019t love their own children or that even if they do love them, they regret having them.", "Absolutely.", "This is how I always felt about it too. I was adopted as an infant, and it was always something I knew about [we celebrated my \"coming home day\" every year, kind if like a \"birthday\" into my family].\n\nPersonally, I never felt abandoned, nor did I ever feel l I'll like I had a \"void\". However, I also never felt \"chosen\", or like there was some divine inspiration behind everything from conception to adoption.\n\nWhen I have explained my personal experience to others, I compare it to being conceived through IVF. It is part of my history, but that's about it. I've never seen it as something derogatory or victimizing, nor have I ever seen it as mystical or \"fateful\". It is just a factual part of my history", "So they should just not exist at all? Damn, needing therapy for a minor abandonment issue or die\u2026 great way to try and make it seem like killing a child is better than them surviving and having a real life with parents that actually love them and maybe need a year of therapy\u2026.", "I\u2019m an adoptee and I\u2019ve never felt abandoned by my biological mother. In fact, I grew up with a very deep respect for her. Giving a child up for adoption is never an easy decision for the bio mom to make. In my case, being an unwed single mother meant embarrassment, shame and humiliation. Her parents were very religious, Southern Baptist, and she had no contact with my bio father. She gave me up at birth, I was in a foster home until I was 6 months old and then I was adopted by my parents. I was told about my adoption when I was 5 years old and I absolutely cherish the memory. My siblings were all there too. \n\nI met my bio mom about 6-7 years ago and I don\u2019t regret it at all!! I took my mom with me and the 3 of us sat at a restaurant for 3-4 hours!! At the end of the meeting, I watched one of the most beautiful moments of my life: both of my \u201cmoms\u201d hugged each other and they said thank you to one another. I know that my reunion is by no means \u201cnormal\u201d and that most of the time when adoptees and bios meet, it doesn\u2019t go well at all. We haven\u2019t really kept it touch, except for a few emails a few times a year. I wasn\u2019t looking for a mom, I already have one that I love to the moon and beyond! I simply wanted the chance to tell her that I didn\u2019t hate her for her choice and that I turned out alright. I wanted her to know that I respected her choice for me.  I have 2 children of my own, both grown now, but I don\u2019t know that I could\u2019ve made the same choice after carrying a child for 9 months!! That takes strength, courage and unconditional love and I will never regret meeting her or her giving me up for adoption!!", "She was honest. He's an adult.", "Or that he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s developing one.", "I was suffering from severe postpartum depression even months after giving birth and was bordering on an alcohol addiction. Maybe it\u2019s because the time was insanely traumatic and I could hardly tell what was real or not, but it was an urgent placement or something of the sort. It\u2019s hard to remember all the details and meetings etc I had to deal with. My mom actually dealt with a lot of what was happening.", "I don't think it's surprising that an adoptee who is harboring anger would want to meet face to face.  Don't you think they would want to see what their biological parent looked like?  How they talked?  What they had to say, if anything, about giving them up for adoption?  There are so many reasons.", "I agree with everything you said, but also want to specify: she deserves grace and understanding from a friend or therapist - not from her son.", "You\u2019ll have to ask him, but it\u2019s not unheard of. Plenty of anti-adoption advocates, former adoptees, on social media say they would have preferred it."]}
