I have a boyfriend (20m) and have been dating him for just over a year, though my boyfriend isn\u2019t a fan of parties, so I would always just go out with a couple of friends and go back to his. My best friend has been dating my sister (20f) who lives nearby for eight months, which has been weird though great. She wasn\u2019t really a fan of that environment as well, though me and my best friend still always went (as we had most of the same mutuals or invites). \n\nMe and my boyfriend got each other matching Tiffany rings \u201cas a joke\u201d over thanksgiving as we both love rings. I jokingly placed it on \u201cthe betrothed finger\u201d and so did he (it\u2019s hilarious). Though I\u2019ve always had a ring on that finger I just replaced it with his.\n\nEver since me and my best friend turned 18 (a week apart), we would always say I was engaged at these parties as the frat guys there were overbearing and they just thought we were insane & traditional to be engaged that young. We would do this most Friday/Saturday\u2019s and way before we were both in relationships. \n\nWe still do that, though recently when I would say \u201csorry! I\u2019m engaged to that guy over there\u201d and they would say \u201clucky guy\u201d & proceed to move on. He would become weird, start pouring drinks for other girls even though we would always be together at parties and completely ignored me at times knowing it agitates me. He just became bitter after these encounters for the last couple of  times. (To clarify, he wasn\u2019t upset by me doing this as he advised me to, he was just making it an \u201cattention\u201d battle and got upset when I spoke to guys who were my friends). \n\nNonetheless, my sister threw a dinner party recently and invited some of her friends/mutuals. I invited my boyfriend, it was a lovely time until a guy arrived late and sat down with us. He kept on glancing at us and could see we were in different couples as this is one of the guys that asked me out at a party and i told him \u201cI was engaged to that guy over there\u201d. I thought maybe he would understand what I did and not say anything, until he said aloud \u201ccongrats on the engagement\u201d. I never wanted to evaporate more than I wanted to in that moment. Everyone at the table was just looking at him and asked him \u201cwho is engaged?\u201d, he said \u201cthose two\u201d and pointed at me and my best friend. \n\nWe both just giggle it off and my sister (as well as my boyfriend) just stare at our soul, I say \u201coh that, I tell people I\u2019m engaged to him at parties so I can have a nice time without it being overbearing\u201d. The rest of the people there laugh it off, though my sister just dismisses herself to \u201cfreshen up\u201d and my boyfriend stops holding my hand. \n\nI thought it was a funny thing and so did my best friend, though they both became dismissive and left the party on a awkward tone. My boyfriend told me \u201che forgot that he needed to study\u201d which is bs and my sister has been ignoring me. \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671140369, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmwwi7/aita_for_showing_my_engagement_ring_to_guys_at/", "score": 342, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes you do look like you\u2019re in love with your best friend. Since you both affectively bought couple rings together.", "Completely agree! I totally understand why the \"hey yeah I'm engaged to that guy right over there\" can be necessary. Men, especially in college (especially especially when drunk), don't take \"No\" as a complete sentence.  Not interested? Playing hard to get. Not attracted to men? I can change that. Dating? I don't see him anywhere. \n\nI also don't understand why it would be so hard for her and her friend to tell their SO's ages ago. \"How was the party?\" \"So fun, and Guy and I figured out an easy way to make creeps back off - we say we're engaged.\" \n\nHowever, not sure the reaction fits the crime. I get feeling mad for being blindsided/not in on the joke. But if there's not already some jealousy/tension with the OP and BFF's relationship vs their SO's it seems overdramatic. (Alas, college relationships can be dramatic though I guess..)", "Literally another man has to be IN THE ROOM for dudes to leave women alone. Saying you're dating, engaged, a lesbian, an alien - none of that works.\n\nOP is still an asshole though for not clearing this plan with her own BF or her sister.", "Ya I've had these experiences myself and been there when friends have. My one friend who was married even told the guy \"I'm married,\" and showed her ring. He said \"well he aint here\" and proceeded to grab her ponytail. Before I could do anything she slapped him hard enough that I felt it in my teeth. The only thing I had to do that night was explain to security what happened. \n\nI dont think the telling people at the party part was wrong. But I do think that not telling the sister and the boyfriend part was. OP is young and hopefully they learn from this. Hopefully the guy learns to not harrass women as well.", "Can you explain the joke? Because I don\u2019t get it and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in that.", "Funny how", "Grow up", "Don't forget two teenagers bought Tiffany rings \"as a joke\"...JFC, how obvious can you make this BS", "oh ok sure\n\nhow long have you regretted not asking your best friend out before you sister did and having to settle for your current boyfriend?", "Tiffany rings are a lot more than that...", "Well, they weren\u2019t bought as a joke as far as I understand. She and her boyfriend got them, not her and her bestfriend", "But she continued the ruse at the party by saying she was engaged to the bf, meaning it was 100% likely it would be brought up...", "Seems like she\u2019s trying to ruin her sisters relationship as well as her own", "You can get a simple Tiffany band for $275. I doubt these 19-year-olds are buying *actual* Tiffany engagement rings.", "https://www.tiffany.com/jewelry/rings/tiffany-infinity-band-ring-GRP07034/\n\nThey start at $175", ">Me and my boyfriend got each other matching Tiffany rings \u201cas a joke\u201d over thanksgiving as we both love rings. I jokingly placed it on \u201cthe betrothed finger\u201d and so did he (it\u2019s hilarious). Though I\u2019ve always had a ring on that finger I just replaced it with his.", ">Nonetheless, my sister threw a dinner party recently and invited some of her friends/mutuals. I invited my boyfriend, it was a lovely time until a guy arrived late and sat down with us. He kept on glancing at us and could see we were in different couples as this is one of the guys that asked me out at a party and i told him \u201cI was engaged to that guy over there\u201d. I thought maybe he would understand what I did and not say anything, until he said aloud \u201ccongrats on the engagement\u201d. I never wanted to evaporate more than I wanted to in that moment. Everyone at the table was just looking at him and asked him \u201cwho is engaged?\u201d, he said \u201cthose two\u201d and pointed at me and my best friend.  \n>  \n>We both just giggle it off and my sister (as well as my boyfriend) just stare at our soul, I say \u201coh that, I tell people I\u2019m engaged to him at parties so I can have a nice time without it being overbearing\u201d. The rest of the people there laugh it off, though my sister just dismisses herself to \u201cfreshen up\u201d and my boyfriend stops holding my hand.\n\nShe did not continue it at her sister's dinner party. One of the guests had been to a previous party.", "It\u2019s not about what they did. It\u2019s the fact that they hadn\u2019t told their partners and asked for their consent to be seen as an engaged couple whenever they went to a party. It could\u2019ve all be solved if they\u2019d told their partners. It might\u2019ve even been funny.", "Your judgment here is obvious: YTA. Accept it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you fucked up and disrespected both your relationship and your sisters. \n\nAnd heads up: if you have to remind us over and over how funny your \u201cjoke\u201d is, then it\u2019s not actually amusing.", "Your attitude is what makes you a huge AH. Gaping, even. So gaping it\u2019s \u201ccavernous.\u201d This need to flex my vocabulary is hilarious, by the way.\n\nYou treat everyone in this story like a toy for your own pleasure. Stories like this require consent from all 4 parties. I was willing to think that you were just young and immature/men really can be quite pushing. But this comment, along with others, shows that you don\u2019t have respect for anyone else here. YTA.", "Lol...\n\nSure, Jan.", "Why are you with your boyfriend when do you actually spend time with him? Do you care about your sisters feelings at all?", "Yeah it's just that people seem to be mistaking what actually happened", "This right here is the heart of the issue.", "yeah this whole thing is just ugh. Like i can understand why op would use the im engaged trick to drive off men who are being a problem, i can even understand why having a man there who is willing to play along is helpful since some men really can't take no for an answer. However they really should have talked it over with each of their respective partners so that everyone was aware and in agreement.\n\nalso im sorry that I was a sarcastic dick in my initial reply, that was uncalled for.", "OH if they didnt I guarantee they suspected they had or might even still do, or at least one of them harbors some \"more than just friends\" feelings for the other. This dumb \"game\" all but just cemented that in BOTH her sister and boyfriends minds. She just blew two relationships and doesn't see how ANY of this is her own fault.", "It\u2019s no problem dude, unlike OP\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d, I actually found your sarcasm pretty funny.", "do you have a heart shaped lightbulb tattoo by any chance?", "Have a wonderful day/night (time zones depending)"]}
