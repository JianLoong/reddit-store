I have a boyfriend (20m) and have been dating him for just over a year, though my boyfriend isn\u2019t a fan of parties, so I would always just go out with a couple of friends and go back to his. My best friend has been dating my sister (20f) who lives nearby for eight months, which has been weird though great. She wasn\u2019t really a fan of that environment as well, though me and my best friend still always went (as we had most of the same mutuals or invites). \n\nMe and my boyfriend got each other matching Tiffany rings \u201cas a joke\u201d over thanksgiving as we both love rings. I jokingly placed it on \u201cthe betrothed finger\u201d and so did he (it\u2019s hilarious). Though I\u2019ve always had a ring on that finger I just replaced it with his.\n\nEver since me and my best friend turned 18 (a week apart), we would always say I was engaged at these parties as the frat guys there were overbearing and they just thought we were insane & traditional to be engaged that young. We would do this most Friday/Saturday\u2019s and way before we were both in relationships. \n\nWe still do that, though recently when I would say \u201csorry! I\u2019m engaged to that guy over there\u201d and they would say \u201clucky guy\u201d & proceed to move on. He would become weird, start pouring drinks for other girls even though we would always be together at parties and completely ignored me at times knowing it agitates me. He just became bitter after these encounters for the last couple of  times. (To clarify, he wasn\u2019t upset by me doing this as he advised me to, he was just making it an \u201cattention\u201d battle and got upset when I spoke to guys who were my friends). \n\nNonetheless, my sister threw a dinner party recently and invited some of her friends/mutuals. I invited my boyfriend, it was a lovely time until a guy arrived late and sat down with us. He kept on glancing at us and could see we were in different couples as this is one of the guys that asked me out at a party and i told him \u201cI was engaged to that guy over there\u201d. I thought maybe he would understand what I did and not say anything, until he said aloud \u201ccongrats on the engagement\u201d. I never wanted to evaporate more than I wanted to in that moment. Everyone at the table was just looking at him and asked him \u201cwho is engaged?\u201d, he said \u201cthose two\u201d and pointed at me and my best friend. \n\nWe both just giggle it off and my sister (as well as my boyfriend) just stare at our soul, I say \u201coh that, I tell people I\u2019m engaged to him at parties so I can have a nice time without it being overbearing\u201d. The rest of the people there laugh it off, though my sister just dismisses herself to \u201cfreshen up\u201d and my boyfriend stops holding my hand. \n\nI thought it was a funny thing and so did my best friend, though they both became dismissive and left the party on a awkward tone. My boyfriend told me \u201che forgot that he needed to study\u201d which is bs and my sister has been ignoring me. \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671140369, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmwwi7/aita_for_showing_my_engagement_ring_to_guys_at/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My wife once got hit on by a guy. He persisted even after she said she was engaged. The guy only stopped when she said I was on my way. \n\nI don't think this excuses OP's behavior, especially the part about not telling her bf or sister, but I do think it explains it.", "Because she thinks she\u2019s getting one over on her sister who had the nerve to date her friend, taking away his attention from OP.

This is disrespectful to your sister, their relationship, your bf and your relationship. A perception of a relationship is also important to the relationship itself.

This is not acceptable. \n\nI understand why you do it, but I always did it with single friends or when I had a bf we took fake engagement pics (like me showing the ring and him kissing my cheek while holding me sort of thing) and set it as my Screensaver and background when I went out.", "Your comments make you sound very out of touch.

The problem is that none of you did actually tell  their partner and checked if they would be comfortable with this and therefore, they discovered it in the worst way possible, in front of their friends and with someone thinking the couples were messed up. Own up to your mistake, they are rightfully mad.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s important to make it known to them that actually every random that has seen you on parties thinks you\u2019re together and engaged.

The issue for me in this instance is that OP could have easily said it was an engagement ring from her boyfriend\u2026.especially when the ring seems to be something meaningful to their relationship. OP then starts talking about that she gets agitated her when sister\u2019s boyfriend ignores her at parties and pays attention to other girls even though they \u201cwould always be together\u201d at these parties.
