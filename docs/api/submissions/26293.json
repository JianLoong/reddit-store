Great zinger though I think it's hilarious", "Good point", "Haha, perfect!", "That is not where the quote is from. The \"May Incident\" you're referencing, when Andrew May revealed tactical information about Japanese depth bombs/submarines in a press conference, happened in June 1943.\n\nThe original \"Loose Lips Might Sink Ships\" poster was published in 1942, part of a series of posters created by the War Advertising Council.", "It\u2019s because he realized halfway through, he didn\u2019t want to create a sound byte of him saying \u201cshame on me\u201d to use in ads against him.", "This is the response I wanted to see", "him and his strategery", "Me too. It's sad how low the bar has fallen.", "Why? Comedic value?", "I'd rather just have fwb at most really.", "True. ESH. Maybe he was hurt by her question? For whatever reason he's staying with his wife, so being tactful adults is still a good idea. Nobody handled it the best.", "If you don't want to be called a whore, don't do whore things. She deserved it.", "The family pressured OP into inviting them. OP's brother needs a wake up call, and this truth is IMO OP's responsibility to point out, as it could ruin his life if he continues to be a doormat.

But yeah I guess I should keep my mouth shut if I see abusive relationships.", "JAH (Justified Asshole) isn't an option lol. So the closest is NTA", "Honestly he saved it pretty good lol", "He thought ahead that quickly?!", "Exactly, he was a comedy goldmine.", "It's cool that you ended up finding out what you (don't) want. Most will just keep hurting partner after partner. A former friend of mine cheated on each and every girlfriend he had, sometimes dated the affair partner and cheated on them with his ex. He only stopped hurting people because at some point literally nobody wanted him around anymore.", "You do realize that you can be an asshole even if what you're saying is true, right? If you see a fat person, and you walk up to them and call them fat, you're still being an asshole. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo we really think that it's ok to insult people just because what we're saying is true? It's still an insult, and it's still something that doesn't need to be said.", "I mean this is a fine way to behave if you want to lose touch with your brother and it\u2019s honestly very childish. I would be very concerned for my family member too in this situation but calling their wife names isn\u2019t going to help.", "Considering the quality of your opinions you should probably just keep your mouth shut in general.", "The man is dumb as a door nail, he saved nothing.", "Not really worth the millions of deaths in the middle east and all tye dead us soldiers though was it?", "Coming from the guy who thinks abuse is a gray area that\u2019s kind of rich.", "We're talking about one particular statement that he, objectively, saved quite well. He prevented being being sound-byted in smear adds, and his save is still being talked about and used in songs 20 years later.\n\nI think you should work on being able to give someone credit for one thing, while still condemning other things that person did. The world is not all black and white, and your way of thinking contributes to the polarized society we live in today.", "Where did I say abuse is a grey area?", "What exactly do you think objectively means?
