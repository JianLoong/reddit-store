People are getting hurt - with deliberate actions!- and that's just not ok.\n\nWhere is your sense of empathy?\n\nEdit: made an error with word placement", "I believe we also use the word mistake for acts of erroneous or poor judgment. \n\nMy parents decided not to get me evaluated for ADHD in spite of suspecting it, that was a decision, it was made and it was reinforced over the course of my entire childhood. It was a mistake in that they were unable to properly evaluate the consequences and didn't know how useful a diagnosis was going to be for me. But it wasn't done with malice. It was a bad decision. It was an error in judgment. It was a mistake.\n\nOf course that's not a perfect comparison because cheating is breaking a contract if you're in a monogamous relationship. And while you can have errors in judgment about the impact that a breach of contract is likely to have on yourself and your partner and you can have errors and judgment about how much you actually want something given what the consequences are going to be, it's pretty clear the entire time that you're breaking a contract. (This gets fuzzier when you have different relationship boundaries, I'm not talking about that, I'm just talking about normative monogamous relationships in the United States.) So cheating can absolutely be a mistake in the error in judgment way, but you're also welcome to judge somebody's character for what kinds of contracts they're willing to breach and for what.\n\nThis is why cheating when you're in a really unhappy marriage gets judge differently than cheating in an otherwise great relationship. What are you breaching the contract for? Do the people around you think that it's a strong enough reason to justify breach of contract? What does it say about you that you were willing to breach the contract for that? \n\nCheating is a mistake if you do it and discover that you made an error in judgment. That you should not have in fact breached the contract, that it wasn't worth it, that you care more about the contract than what you got. It may not be a fixable mistake. The other person in your relationship is well within their rights to decide they don't want to have that contract with you if you are not going to abide by the rules of it, or they may feel like once it's been breached it's broken and it can't be put back together. Those are valid things for them to feel. And if you do it a second time after discovering that it felt like a mistake to you, then I perhaps start to question the language of mistake. Then that language starts feeling kind of manipulative, no matter how genuinely felt. But come on. Bad decisions can be mistakes. Consistently reinforced bad decisions can be mistakes. Calling something a mistake doesn't excuse it.\n\nBut you can correct an error in judgment. You can help push someone to make better choices. Otherwise good people can have errors in judgment. Cheating is not different. It's not special. There's nothing unique about romantic or sexual engagement as a site for horrendous fuck up decisions about your social life except that we live in a society that's so highly prioritizes your romantic and sexual engagements.", "Cheating can be a mistake on the part of the one not cheating. \n\nIt stops being a mistake and becomes a choice when you know the other party is cheating and decide to continue it.\n\nExample: I meet someone start dating them. 2 months later they tell me they are actually married and cheating. Up to this point, I had no idea, after this point it's making the conscious choice to continue their cheating behavior. \n\nFor me, personally, as I saw from my parents (Mom cheated with my Dad, she later cheated on my Dad) If someone will cheat with you, they will cheat on you.", "My ex wife cheated on me, she didn\u2019t intend to cheat when we got married but we were unhappily married and she needed an outlet for her unhappiness. I don\u2019t think that means she was a bad person when I married her, or, even when she cheated on me, it meant she made a bad decision as to how to cope with her unhappiness.

They are adults who decided for themselves. \n\nIf we discuss I will be honest with them on it and told them that they can do better than that for themselves and other people. If they decide to continue on that path I just tell them that I cannot follow. \n\nBeing friends doesn\u2019t mean that you have to agree and follow that friend on everything they do. \n\nCheating is my personal limit because I think that it reflect a person morality and ways of treating people around them.", "Well, to each their own. But I still think it's cheating even if you're not currently in a relationship with someone - cheating with is just as much cheating as cheating on.", ">Of course that's not a perfect comparison because cheating is breaking a contract if you're in a monogamous relationship.\n\nI would also argue they're different bc there weren't clear consequences for your parents not getting you diagnosed-they didn't know what impact that would have on you, so they had to make a decision based on the limited knowledge they had. Whereas with cheating, everyone knows the consequences and impact of that. You're not making a blind decision. Another big difference is that your parents were trying to do the best they could for you, but that's certainly not what cheaters are doing. \n\n>So cheating can absolutely be a mistake in the error in judgment way, but you're also welcome to judge somebody's character for what kinds of contracts they're willing to breach and for what.\n\nMarriage isn't just a contract, though, so cheating shouldn't be viewed solely through the lens of breaking a contract. \n\n>This is why cheating when you're in a really unhappy marriage gets judge differently than cheating in an otherwise great relationship.\n\nI think it depends on how unhappy the marriage is and whether you've at least made an attempt to work through it (although I still think in that case a divorce would be better, bc why not if you're just going to cheat on them? What poknt is there maintaining a relationship that you're not invested in?). Like, I absolutely support cheating if your partner is abusive-I can see how you'd need the support of someone who actually cares about you and can help you get out of an awful situation, and abusors deserve zero respect, so who cares about upholding wedding vows in that situation?\n\n>Cheating is a mistake if you do it and discover that you made an error in judgment.\n\nAt which point do you have to discover that for it to be considered a mistake, though? Bc there are multiple times while in the process of cheating that you can stop before it gets to the point of anything sexual. Like, some of the steps are:\n\n1.) Approaching someone with the intent of expressing romantic/sexual interest in them. \n\n2.) Flirting with them (specifically with the intent of following through-I know some couples don't care about harmless, playful flirting that won't go anywhere).\n\n3.) Making an actual, verbal agreement to spend the night together. \n\n4.) Going someplace private-like the other person's home-in order to have sex. \n\n5.) Foreplay such as kissing, groping, etc before having sex.\n\nThat's a *lot* of opportunities to realize you're making a mistake and disengage. How many chances do you get before you're not allowed to call it an error of judgment anymore?", "Totally agree, but I didn't mention it bc that doesn't seem to be the case her. I doubt the friend isn't aware he's married if OP knows.", ">My ex wife cheated on me, she didn\u2019t intend to cheat when we got married but we were unhappily married and she needed an outlet for her unhappiness.\n\nThat's not how that works. You can't just \"not intend to cheat,\" bc it's really easy to *not* cheat. All you have to do is not have sex with another person while in a relationship. There were a million things she could have done before she consciously decided to sleep with another person, like talk to you about her feelings, or seek therapy, or get a divorce. The fact that she \"needed an outlet for her unhappiness\" does not mean what she did wasn't wrong in every way. There were other ways to find an outlet that don't involve doing a bad thing. Tbh, that mentality is very similar to what abuse victims are led to believe: they think their partner needs an outlet and however they find that is excusable bc it's framed as necessary, even if it hurts them. \n\n>I don\u2019t think that means she was a bad person when I married her, or, even when she cheated on me, it meant she made a bad decision as to how to cope with her unhappiness.\n\nNo, she absolutely made a bad decision. Like I said, if she was unhappy, there were plenty of things she could have done instead of cheat. I think you need to ask yourself why she couldn't just have a conversation with you where you guys came to a compromise or whatever was necessary, or suggest couple's counseling or a divorce if the relationship simply wasn't working out. She had other options, but she didn't choose those, she chose to cheat. She chose to betray your trust, your feelings, and potentially infect you with an STD (if she wasn't being careful). That is the very definition of a bad decision. \n\n>I on the other hand didn\u2019t cheat but I was a miserable guy and no doubt that played a role in her decision. Without understanding what goes into someone\u2019s decision you are massively simplifying and not supporting a friend.\n\nThat's not an excuse for her behavior. It doesn't matter that you were a miserable guy, or could have made a better partner, or put more effort in, or whatever. She made a commitment to you, and if she felt you weren't doing the same, it was her responsibility to address that with you before turning her back on her vows and commitment. \n\nI'll be honest, it sounds like you're trying to justify her cheating in order to make the sting of it hurt less-if she had what you decide to be a \"good reason\" for cheating, then maybe what she did to you wasn't that bad after all.", "\u201cStealing taken men\u201d???

You played a role in her being in an unhappy marriage, sure, but you *did not* play a role in her cheating. That was fully her decision, and you are not responsible for another person's actions. I hope you understand that just bc she was happy, it doesn't excuse her cheating? Amd you're not to blame for her choosing to cheat instead of seeking other ways to solve her issue. \n\nLike I said, I want you to ask yourself why she chose to cheat instead of discussing things with you or asking for a divorce. Bc that says a lot about her character. She didn't respect you as a person or as her partner if she chose to cheat instead of addressing the problem with the person she committed to. I'm not asking for personal details, but I do wonder how this was all discovered. Did she tell you or did you have to find out? Do you think she would have continued to cheat if given the chance? Do you know she was being safe with her affair partners, and how do you know?

I didn\u2019t block him out of my life over this, nor did I immediately tell her about it myself, though I probably would\u2019ve if I actually knew her (they met in another state, we\u2019ve never met each other). BUT, I did tell him straight up that he was shitty for that and that he needed to tell her and between that time and me finding out that he finally did come clean there was a noticeable strain on our relationship. I couldn\u2019t look at him with the same level of respect anymore because I understood that he didn\u2019t deserve it. \n\nReal friendship requires mutual respect. I couldn\u2019t possibly sit silently as my friends mistreat and hurt other people and then convince myself it says nothing about me that I\u2019m letting it happen. I\u2019m sorry, but if you\u2019re a grown adult and your friends are assholes and liars and cheaters, it says something about you. You can say \u201cit doesn\u2019t imo,\u201d but it just objectively does. All of our choices say something about us. Who you spend your life with and energy on *must* say something if anything does. To reject that responsibility outright is to infantilize yourself. \n\nBack to OP\u2019s scenario, it sounds to me like this affair has been going on for some time with OP fully aware and not openly objecting to it. So either \n\n1. OP doesn\u2019t really respect her friend and their relationship is very shallow (weird and unlikely imo considering she threw a big party for her)\n2. OP respects her friend, but not the cheating, yet is willing to just look past it indefinitely (combo of bad friendship and light YTA for enabling and supporting someone being awful) \n3. OP respects her friend fully despite the cheating, thus indirectly giving her approval of that behavior (heavy YTA)", "Thank you for explaining that one. I never got it before.", "tbf, the friend isn't the one who stood up in front of their friends and relatives and pledged to be faithful to their partner. Cheating on your partner is far worse than having a relationship with a married person imo, although neither are good. I think I'd be much more forgiving of the latter.\n\nI wouldn't even describe friend as a 'cheater'. They're an accessory to cheating at most. They're not cheating on anyone and they're not being unfaithful", "Not gonna lie. I\u2019m not reading all that. Stop trying to sway MY OPINION.
