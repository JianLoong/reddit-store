One broke a lifelong promise to their partner and has intentionally chosen to mess up a lot of people\u2019s lives that they love. The other is having a bit of fun with minimal consequences to the people that they love. \n\nThe second hasn\u2019t broken any promises. You really can\u2019t equate the two.", "If you're knowingly dating someone who is in a relationship, aka cheating with you, you're nearly as bad as the cheater themselves.", "She knows that he is married and is engaging in that behavior. She is just as trashy as he is.", "That feels like being ridiculously pedantic. She\u2019s not the one actually cheating on a partner, but she\u2019s knowingly having an affair with a married man. That\u2019s as good as cheating in my book.", "I was upset and disappointed with a good friend years ago over this exact thing. My insisting on telling her my truth didn't actually lift her up to be her best self. So, me putting my finger on the scale only made me feel righteous. At any rate, many years later, my friend told me that she regretted her actions then and continues to in the here and now. I think that its much harder to live with our judgment of ourselves than with anyone else's when make poor choices.", "I can appreciate what you evolved into doing. I just wouldn't do the same. Old me might have. But, I can't be bothered anymore.", "I said authoritarian, that's not facism.  \n\n\noften capitalized : a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.", "There is zero reason to cheat. You must be a sad lil person with a sad lil life to try and have such a trash take.", "Looooooool, hard disagree there. She took no marriage vows.", "She, a single woman, is just as trashy as the person that took marriage vows and is cheating on his spouse?  \n\nLol.  No. Nooooooooo.  It's maybe...10% as bad.", "Yup! I had a friend who said she really gets turned on while flirting with married or committed men.\nI HAD a friend. \nI can't wait for OP to be back here in a few months. \"AITA?! My friend, who I've known for years has a thing for stealing taken men, has been flirting with my boyfriend and now it's an issue!!\"\n\nNTA for the party thing though. Your friend and her little boy toy are stupid for trying to start a fight when they're being little ho bags behind the wife's back, as though they suddenly care about what's right and wrong lol.", "That is your opinion. I think cheaters are all vile. But a single person getting with a married guy, while icky, is not nearly as bad.", "Cool, I was making a joke.", "Bullshit."]}
