No one is entitled to pressure you into deciding what you'll do with your money, but at the same time, you have to face the backlash or criticism that arises from your decision.\n\nAs someone who trusts a stable government welfare system more than private charities (a lot of the ones in my country were busted for treating their patients or residents horribly or even abusing them, and I don't want to imagine what atrocities they have done behind our backs as they embezzled the money), I do think it was a rash decision to donate NINETY percent of the money. I would rather discuss what I should do with it only with the family members *that I can trust*, keep the money, and decide what I can do with it to make my/our future life better, eg. buying myself a house, buying *my parents* a house, paying off any debt I have, saving up to prepare for my parents' retirement, or chipping in for my favorite relative's medical bills.

You obviously do not have to check with them on anything because it\u2019s not their money. \n\nHowever, if you\u2019re close with them and chose to give your money away to strangers rather than people close to you, I can see them validly questioning if they should consider you as someone close to them. \n\nAgain, if you\u2019re not close, don\u2019t worry about it. But if you were, I can see them taking it as if you value them less than strangers.", "Info: why didn't your grandmother leave anything to your siblings?

I think that\u2019s exactly what sways it. If you don\u2019t like your siblings and your grandma didn\u2019t like them either who cares what they think. If you do have a good relationship with them and they had good one with grandma then this would be a major AH move. \n\nYou say this would make a huge difference in their lives but you gave them nothing. I mean it\u2019s your money you can do what you want but I couldn\u2019t imagine doing that to my family if I knew it would be life changing for them and I didn\u2019t need it all.  Legally you\u2019re not an AH but morally I think you kinda are if you are close with your siblings. They are fully within their right to be upset that you chose to help strangers (who likely won\u2019t actually see any of the money as a lot of charities use a huge portion of donations for \u201cadmin fees\u201d) over them, especially if you all had a good relationship. When she said \u201cYou have a good heart you\u2019ll know what to do\u201d I\u2019m not sure she meant leaving them out completely but that is her fault for not clarifying in an actual will, it was naive of her as that could be interpreted in many ways. \n\nThe easiest way you could have solved this would have been to put a large chunk to charity and split some between family, instead of just taking some for yourself and screwing over your family. Then there would have been no arguments, charity\u2019s still get a large donation and everyone\u2019s lives are a little easier with the money. I won\u2019t put judgement until the original questions I put were answered. I think your grandma is more of an Ah than anyone so far for not clarifying what she wanted doing with the money instead of open ended statements like \u201cyou\u2019ll know what to do!\u201d as alls she\u2019s done with this will is caused arguments between the family.", "YTA.", "It sounds like the money was given to you and it was your choice what to do with it.

Its just possible that legally she was the only one old enough for grandma to leave her money too.", "Oh no, I\u2019m not at all suggesting that he shouldn\u2019t allow his family to live in luxury, or that he can\u2019t be both generous and philanthropic. I have no issue with it, I\u2019d hope if Bill was my dad he\u2019d leave me loads of cash. I think the spirit of what the commenter is saying that \u201cok, kids won\u2019t inherit anything from me and will have to find their own way\u201d is really a lot different than \u201cI\u2019ve given them their inheritance while I was living and they won\u2019t actually need to be willed anything bc they already have what they need to live a life of luxury.\u201dYou know? The spirit behind the way his message was received is a lot different than the reality of his children\u2019s situation. And I think he fully intended for his message to be interpreted the way it\u2019s been..bc it sounds so selfless etc. otherwise why even announce it? A 51 million dollar home is crazy, on top of whatever else she has. She would never need to work.", "How do you think a full time student afforded a $51M apartment?  Call me crazy, but I think a $51M handout is a hefty inheritance.  Of course, I would assume she has much more coming to her.  She didn\u2019t even have to wait for him to die to get to live off it!\n\nGates is free to set his children up for a life of luxury.  It\u2019s how he has lied about what he will do that I find disgusting.  Lies like his convince poor people like OP to give to charity while rich fucks like him hoard multigenerational wealth.", "how much money do they have? and how much money do you have? because honestly this reads like you\u2019re financially better off than they are", "INFO Are you financially in the same position as your siblings? If so, why did you keep 10% for yourself?", "And OP still kept 10% don't forget, so she's going to benefit from some of it herself"]}
