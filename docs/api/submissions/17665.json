No one is entitled to pressure you into deciding what you'll do with your money, but at the same time, you have to face the backlash or criticism that arises from your decision.\n\nAs someone who trusts a stable government welfare system more than private charities (a lot of the ones in my country were busted for treating their patients or residents horribly or even abusing them, and I don't want to imagine what atrocities they have done behind our backs as they embezzled the money), I do think it was a rash decision to donate NINETY percent of the money. I would rather discuss what I should do with it only with the family members *that I can trust*, keep the money, and decide what I can do with it to make my/our future life better, eg. buying myself a house, buying *my parents* a house, paying off any debt I have, saving up to prepare for my parents' retirement, or chipping in for my favorite relative's medical bills.

But if you were, I can see them taking it as if you value them less than strangers.", "Info: why didn't your grandmother leave anything to your siblings?

If you do have a good relationship with them and they had good one with grandma then this would be a major AH move. \n\nYou say this would make a huge difference in their lives but you gave them nothing. I mean it\u2019s your money you can do what you want but I couldn\u2019t imagine doing that to my family if I knew it would be life changing for them and I didn\u2019t need it all.  Legally you\u2019re not an AH but morally I think you kinda are if you are close with your siblings. They are fully within their right to be upset that you chose to help strangers (who likely won\u2019t actually see any of the money as a lot of charities use a huge portion of donations for \u201cadmin fees\u201d) over them, especially if you all had a good relationship. When she said \u201cYou have a good heart you\u2019ll know what to do\u201d I\u2019m not sure she meant leaving them out completely but that is her fault for not clarifying in an actual will, it was naive of her as that could be interpreted in many ways. \n\nThe easiest way you could have solved this would have been to put a large chunk to charity and split some between family, instead of just taking some for yourself and screwing over your family. Then there would have been no arguments, charity\u2019s still get a large donation and everyone\u2019s lives are a little easier with the money. I won\u2019t put judgement until the original questions I put were answered. I think your grandma is more of an Ah than anyone so far for not clarifying what she wanted doing with the money instead of open ended statements like \u201cyou\u2019ll know what to do!\u201d as alls she\u2019s done with this will is caused arguments between the family.", "YTA.", "It sounds like the money was given to you and it was your choice what to do with it.

I", "Not all grandmas are good people.", "Not necessarily. Sometimes, it makes the most sense to leave everything to someone you think loves the family as much as you do. And that you can trust to do the right thing when the time comes. Sometimes, there can be many beneficiaries, especially with grandparents (you also have to split with aunts, uncles, and cousins). And dividing out equally dilutes it so much it doesn't really make that big of a difference in anyone's life. Or sometimes beneficiaries can't  be trusted with their own share. I'm an addict, and even though I've been good for nearly two years now, I wouldn't be surprised if my share of the inheritance came under one of my siblings care. That doesn't mean my parents would want my brother to donate my entire share to Doctors Without Borders.", "This goes both ways.\n\nShe left ops siblings out of the will.\n\nShe left charity out of the will.\n\nYou tell me, if shit is left out of the will, does it go to charity or other family members?\n\nIn one of ops comments they said \"grandma left it to me cuz I have a good heart and she trusted what u would do with it\" Personally? I think op betrayed that trust, because who with a good heart give away 90% of a huge sum of money before you know, doing what people with good hearts do and taking care of their family?\n\nThis COMPLETELY changes if op or their grandma was mistreated by the family.

NTA\n\nYou only \\_might\\_ be into TA territory if one of your siblings is on the verge of homelessness or something, and a one-time cash injection would have solved their problems, but if all it was going to do was move everyone into a higher tax bracket, it's probably put to better use with charity anyway.  As long as it wasn't Bob Jones University or something along those lines.  :)", "Nothing wrong at all with his family having nice things. But he said he\u2019s giving his children NOTHING and donating it to charity, which the commenter is simply saying turned out not to be true.", "He doesn\u2019t have to give a dime to charity.  But he shouldn\u2019t lie about setting his children up for a life of luxury.  Lying is wrong and Bill Gates is a shameless liar.  I\u2019m sure that trait helped him amass his fortune.", "Sure. But that doesn't solve OP's problem. Grandma left it up to OP to do what SHE wants with the money. She, I think, unnecessarily caused resentment and anger with her siblings. If she is already estranged from them that wouldn't matter. But she damaged the relationship and now she has to live with that. She was very na\u00efve if she didn't think this would cause an uproar.", "If grandma wanted the money to go to charity, she would have stated that in the will.", "Me too...\nHonestly i would be mad as hell", "Then NTA. It's your money, you get to choose what to do with it.", "I hope so too. I really hate this woman.", "And I disagree with you. My point wasn't legal - i don't think the siblings had any moral, spiritual, asshole-ian, or other claim to the money that grandma earned / otherwise had, and bequeathed to OP. Why on earth would they? \"Family\" isn't a good enough answer.", "And you just decided to leave them struggling so you can look good?", "It's yours to do as you see fit. Giving it to charity and not perpetuating generational wealth is a morally appropriate thing to do.\n\nNTA.", "Her grandmother gave it to her bc she said she had \u201ca good heart\u201d and would know what to do with it.", "idk it kinda sounds like op did exactly what her grandmother wanted her to do with the money. Cos if she did in fact want the siblings to have a share she wouldve just given it to them directly or left specific instructions on how/for what to help them with it rather than just leave it to op.", "True but we don't know that this particular grandma wasn't a good person. Maybe she thought the siblings weren't good people, we don't have that info.", "You're right that we don't have all the info and that does make all the difference in being able to say whether OP is TA or not. We don't know if the grandma was mistreated. We don't know if the siblings are irresponsible jerks that hated grandma and now just want her cash. \n\nHowever, I don't agree that giving money to charity is somehow not ok here. Giving most of your inheritance to charity could be exactly what a person with a good heart would do. As opposed to spending it on cars or clothes or vacation homes. Maybe grandma knew the siblings would squander it and the OP would give it to people in need? I see most of these responses are coming from the assumption that the OP's family is a kind well functioning group and we just don't know that at at..", "Did bill Gates say that he was not going to let his kids inherit, or that he was going to cut them off and not pay for anything?", ">She was very na\u00efve if she didn't think this would cause an uproar\n\nHonestly, i don't see why it should.

But good-hearted people take care of their families. Just giving away a large sum of money that could have helped your siblings seems more spiteful to me than good-hearted. Either spiteful or just plain childish.", "Did her grandmother know her?", "It's really impossible to know grandma's motives and wishes. But sometimes one person is chosen because splitting it up equally between siblings dilutes it so much that it doesn't really help anyone. I got $1300 from the sale of my great grandmother's house for example because it was so sub divided between kids and grandkids. My grandmother is likely to pick my Mom out of her 8 children for this reason. But that's only because she feels like my Mom is the one that can be most trusted to do right by the family and put that money to best use for the family. She would be horrified if my mother just gave it away. You could also argue that if grandma wanted it donated to charity, she'd have just willed it to charity.", "> Bill Gates, who has a net worth of $137 billion, is not planning to turn over his massive fortune to his kids, Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe. The business mogul recently explained that his children will be given every opportunity to get an education, but they will not be left to live off a hefty inheritance.\n\nOf course, he was lying.", "They're not.

And if they don't, well, that sounds like their problem", "And she didn't want the money to go to the family either. She wanted to be op the one that inherits it. And since it was now op's money, op can do with them whatever she wants. Including not giving it to her entitled family. There's a reason why grandma didn't liked them. \n\n>She didn't want the money to go to charity, or else she would have just done that herself.\n\nThe difference is, that she didn't rejected charity. She just didn't considered it an option. But she rejected her other family members.", "Exactly! Like, what charities would be closer to your heart than your own family?", "Well they all have money. And I donated to charities for people that actually need help", "Did she reject them? Or did she intend to just make life easier by only picking one person to then dole it out? By your logic, she rejected charity.", "Starving children... my family is not starving and not even close to being starving", "You yourself said it was enough money to make a huge difference in the lives of your siblings, and now you're trying to walk it back because you're getting called out for being an asshole.", "What do you consider \u201cneeding help?\u201d Like, literal starvation and homelessness? \u201cMy family is fine! They get food stamps and they live right on a potato farm! They\u2019re all fine!\u201d", "You pretend to be\u2026but you\u2019re not a good person.  I hope this was worth losing your family over.  Yta", "How would it make it easier just picking one?? And she would've said if she wanted op to dole out. Point of the matter is : this is op's money.

It would serve you right if they never spoke to you again.", "Sorry but the vast amount of money that goes to charities actually goes to paying the employees and fundraisers. Very little actually goes to the \u201ccause.\u201d  It\u2019s not an overstatement to say most charities are little more than MLM scams. \n\nThe overwhelming bulk of your money likely was just wasted.", "Good catch. OP you suck. And answer my question about whether you love your siblings", "Good grief.  Please don\u2019t spread such negative generalizations.  You may have encountered scam artists trying to milk you for \u201ccharity\u201d but that certainly is NOT the case for thousands of legitimate, serious organizations who raise money and do great work for charity.  \n\nA good question to ask is if the organization has 501C(3) status, or similar.  This means the charity is considered eligible (by the IRS) to receive tax-deductible donations, and that its financial activities are monitored.  There are multiple watchdogs in place to rate charities and in general, a max of 20% of funding can go to expenses, thus ensuring that the bulk of donations goes to the stated beneficiary.  \n\nSpreading blanket statements denigrating charities in general is disrespectful and harmful to the millions of people who work so very hard to help others."]}
