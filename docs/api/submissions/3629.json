And, when they start to see themselves as failing to live up to the \"winning\" requirement then their self-esteem plummets, soon followed by even worse behavior.\n\nLead and manage a team discussion about this and if there is any chance it will get sidelined by an outspoken teen who thinks too highly of himself, find another professional to come in and deliver it.

I can think of some things that would go beyond sticking the kid on the bench.)\n\nAlex\u2019s inability to maintain language and temper are certainly a problem, but he does seem quite competitive. He was more concerned about the win. \n\nBOTH kids need some intervention- if Craig was pimping Alex he was Not a Team Player, as he felt it more important to impair his teammate than contribute to the team. Not to mention costing the team on the scoreboard by not passing to a score hound. IMHO, Time to ride the wooden pony. Alex is more of a team player, yet has anger management issues need to be addressed. He does not want to cost the team via sending the opposing team to the foul line. \n\nThe entire team needs a heads up about working as a team, sportsmanship, and attitude.
