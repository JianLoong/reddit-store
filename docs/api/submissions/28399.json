All of us are on the lease and split rent equally.\n\nHis girlfriend (F22) (We will call her Jill), likes to stay over, she is there basically every night. she technically still lives at her parents house (all her possessions are there) and she does not have a job. She does not pay rent or contribute to our apartment in anyway (Thats fine, she doesn\u2019t \u201clive\u201d here).\n\nWell she will stay at the apartment once our roommate mate, her boyfriend leaves for work and she will stay part or all day. She will come over when he isn\u2019t even here and just hangout in the house. (She has a key)\n\nThe thing about Jill is that she is not super friendly, not mean or abrasive, but she will not acknowledge your existence most of the time and sometimes doesn\u2019t respond when you say hello. Generally keeps to herself. She has depressive and anxiety issues so I understand the apprehension to socializing.\n\nThe issue is that me and my wife don\u2019t feel comfortable with her because of said issues. If our roommate mate is here we have told him she is more than welcome to stay at the house, but we would like it if she isn\u2019t here when he is not, as she is not friendly with us and it makes my wife especially uncomfortable to have her around when it is only the two of them at the house.\n\nOur view is that we pay for the privilege of having the house to ourselves when our roommate isn\u2019t here. Same goes for when we leave, we don\u2019t have people staying at our place when we aren\u2019t there. Seems like reasonable expectation to not have her over when he isn\u2019t here especially when she \n\n1) Does not pay rent\n2) Is not on the lease\n3) Is not friendly to us\n4) Does not contribute e to the apartment (chores ect\u2026)\n\nOur roommate agrees with us that this is reasonable request and has talked to his GF many times about not coming over when he isn\u2019t there.\n\nWe have also told our roommate that we want open communication and would like to have a conversation with her about this if that is something she is interested in\n\nToday, she blew up on my wife and sent a very insulting and inflammatory text message. \n\nWe have asked him not to have her over until we can all sit down and have a civil conversation about the matter. \n\nAre wrong? Is what we are asking super weird and controlling? I would like an outside perspective \n\nThank you!", "created_utc": 1696648134, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171vt2j/aita_roommates_gf_at_our_apartment_when_roommate/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not a resident. She has no right to be in your home when your roommate isn't. Your request is completely reasonable and not super weird or controlling. In fact, you are even being MORE than accommodating by asking for a conversation.", "  NTA. \n\nPaying rent = keys.\n\nNot paying rent = no keys. Roomie has to get the keys back. He shouldn\u2019t have given them to her in the first place.", "NTA.  Frankly, I think there needs to be a conversation about taking away her key.  When someone abuses a privilege, like having a key to a place where they are not a resident, losing the privilege is a reasonable consequence.  She knows she\u2019s not supposed to come over when he\u2019s not home, but she doesn\u2019t respect that reasonable boundary.  When someone doesn\u2019t respect a boundary, you have to enforce it or the boundary essentially ceases to exist.", "Omg NTA and you are being way nicer about this than I would be!!! And your roommate is the one that should be dealing with this and having the talks with her, he is the one that caused this by giving her a key and allowing her free reign of the place.", "NTA. Your roommate needs to take that key back or if she wants the key, charge her rent if she\u2019s over there that much.", "NTA. If she\u2019s also there during the day then the bills should prob be spilt 4 ways and not 3.", "NTA. Your roommate shouldn\u2019t have given her a key.", "NTA. You need to tell your roommate what she said and tell him that she is no longer welcome in your life and if he still wants to be with her it will have to be away from you.", "NTA\n\nShe is not a tenant or resident. Your home is not a hangout or crash pad. She shouldn\u2019t have a key either.", "I had a large apartment where I rented two bedrooms for seven years. What you are talking about is my absolute NIGHTMARE. The boy-girlfriend who decides that he or she is part of the place. And who gives themselves rights.\n\nFirstly, how did she get the key? Who gave it to her? Your roommate? He should answer for that. How dare he? He's the one who created this problem. It\u2019s breaking trust. Who is this girl ? She doesn't seem like the trustworthy type at all. Now to get revenge, she can make fifteen keys with your address on them and distribute them.\n\nTake away the keys and change the locks and the roommate would have to pay for everything.", "Nta change the locks. If she's there while he is not have her trespassed off your property and inform your landlord that she basically lives there.", "NTA demand he take back her key. Her behavior towards your wife means she cannot be in the apt unless her BF is there to supervise her.", "NTA and not overreacting.  You shouldn\u2019t have to be uncomfortable or walk in eggshells in your own home.", "NTA. It's not ok for anyone else to have a key unless all parties agree. Not on the lease, no key. Guests need to leave when their host leaves.", "NTA   this happened to me and a friend in a shared house once.  3rd roomate had that months floozy over even when  he was out.  After 5 days we both walked  into the kitchen , took our food out of her hands and said get out.  Pre Mobile phones so she couldn't phone and cry  .  He started paying extra rent, water, food  and electricity.", "YTA. No stuff & not on the lease = no rent. It doesn\u2019t matter how long she is there or what she does. She\u2019s not on the lease.

She is mentally unstable", "Do you think it is unreasonable to ask not to have her over until we can all have a conversation? On one hand it will be SUPER uncomfortable for her to be here if we don\u2019t have a conversation. But also, it\u2019s his gf and he pays rent to. I\u2019m unsure of what to think", "But.. the roommate even agreed that she shouldn't be there when he isn't.  He talked to her many times, she just does it anyway.

No young kid screaming daily because they hate to home.", "Yes it's horrible. Sorry for you.   \nChanging the lock its the best thing to do.\n\nThe first time i go through hell but the good news is that then i are wary like the plague and i don't make the mistake again.  \n\r  \nIn my appartment I had 3 rules (for possible inspiration)\r  \n1- girl-boyfriend are welcome 3 days and/or nights per week MAXIMUM. And then there are obviously 4 of them left but on the fourth day we make a somewhat harsh comment and we have peace for the rest of the week.\r  \n2- the girl-boyfriend does not have the right to be in the apartment in the absence of the roommate.\r  \n3- The girl-boyfriend toothbrush cannot be left in the bathroom. (as soon as the brush is in the brush glass. the girl-boyfriend is at home it is psychological therefore, never.)\r  \n\r  \nThe keys lol... for you we bet it was the last time ;)", "Get the key back and talk to your landlord. See if she\u2019s is violating your lease", "You're being reasonable and kind. Plus, now it seems you need to lookout for her mistreatment of y'all. Yes, your roommate pays rent and has a vote on it, but you're nothing hurting them with your actions.", "I would never have asked my roommate\u2019s gf to pay rent if she was paying on another apartment where she had a lease and all her shit was there. That\u2019s asinine. It doesn\u2019t matter what her behavior is like at their place.", "Nevermind, it's an apartment.", "Haha definitely my last time ever doing something dumb like that again.\n\nWill 100% use these rules in the future, especially the toothbrush one!", "But she isn\u2019t paying rent she lives at her parents for free. She has a free place to stay at her parents.", "Did you even read the post? He\u2019s not asking for rent. He doesn\u2019t want her there without her boyfriend", "I feel challenged by your story because I lived this nightmare and it's not simple... If I can allow myself some advice, I read that the roommate tried to invite the girl back into the apartment after all that... That's the problem with couples, especially new ones. When they are together the brain releases oxytocyne and they become \"high\" in a way, in fact they are really high.\r  \n\r  \nYour roommate seems like a reasonable person with whom you have a good relationship (apart from the fact that he was stupid enough to give her a key) but from my experience, things can change very quickly. If he can't see his girlfriend, he will fall \u201cin need\u201d and risk becoming aggressive and angry with you.\r  \n\r  \nWe don't expect it but it's quite a delicate situation and everything can degenerate quite quickly.\r  \n\r  \nThe main argument is: \u201cI pay my rent, I have the right to see my partner. \u00bb and this, without discussing around a table before. Be prepared that there may be a confrontation. From there, perhaps you can find out about the exact rights of each person. Can you legally demand that this girl no longer come? Kick the roommate out if he becomes unbearable because of his resentment? It's better to know beforehand because like I said, it's very surprising how crazy lovers are. Drug addicts who want their syringe at all costs and will do anything to get it.\r  \n\r  \nPrepare your arguments for all situations. But it seem the discussion is a good idea. She seems terrified at the idea. It's a good tool. And very peaceful. Discussing between adults is perhaps the key to getting rid of it. Weird lol !\r  \n\r  \nBut of course, this is the worst case scenario, I hope everything goes peacefully. And if your roommate doesn't go crazy even if you don't want his grilfriend anymore, you have a gem. And a pretty rare one. Keep him lol"]}
