My roommate left for a few days and there was no prior conversation that he was going to be here. I have my own personal issues with men let alone men in my only safe space which is my house. Anyways he said he was just going to eat for a bit a leave. This was 9 pm. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and let them stay til 1245 around when I was heading to bed. At 1245 I asked if he was leaving soon. He then said he\u2019s spending the night. I immediately told them I\u2019m not comfortable with that. I said I\u2019ve never met you and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re nice but I was given no heads up or warning so I\u2019d like him to leave. He was reluctant but said he understood and ultimately ended up leaving at 1. I texted my roommate and told her politely I\u2019m not comfortable with that and I would really appreciate common courtesy of respecting my living space since it\u2019s just as much mine as hers.

You haven't even heard from your roommate confirming this is someone they actually know and did invite over? Nope, nope, nope! I've watched too many Mr. Ballin stories to let that happen. Also he said he would leave in a bit, then said he was staying? **NOPE!** I'm glad you're safe. Your roommate owes you a *huge* apology and a promise to never, ever invite anyone over to stay without your consent, meaning they *ask you if it's okay and get your permission first.* I mean, if they were inviting someone over to stay with them while they are there and never leave them alone in the house unless you are familiar with them and comfortable with that, that's fine, but inviting someone to come over to your place while they aren't even there and stay the night and not even bother to tell you, let alone *ask you first?* **Oh hell no!**", "NTA.  This was a really creepy story.  I might have nightmares.  What was your roommate thinking?", "NTA. That\u2019s weird as hell", "NTA, not even a little bit", "NTA.

You don't spring an unattended, unknown male overnight guest on your female roommate without talking about it.", "NTA \u2014 glad you are safe, that was a horrible situation to be in. I would have kicked them out asap. How did they even get in? And do they still have access?\n\nTell someone you trust to care about your safety in real life just in case.", "NTA \n\nMy God! How scary! You did nothing wrong by asking him to leave. When your roommate comes home, (if not before) you need to sit her down and have a serious conversation with her about strangers who aren\u2019t known to both of you to just come on in and lollygag around! It\u2019s a scary world out there. How would she like it if you\u2019d done something like that!? It\u2019s extremely disrespectful not to mention scary.", "NTA, if I walked into my home and saw a stranger and my roommate was out of town I would have backed out and called the cops.", "NTA at all! She shouldn\u2019t give a person access to your shared space when she\u2019s not there. Especially not someone you don\u2019t know and without even a warning. But also if you did know him and she did warn you, you get to refuse.", "NTA. I have no issues with men and have some experience wich makes me believe that my chances to protect muself aren't too low, bur I would make him leave at once if I were in such situation. You was not warned, you have almost no means to verify its the very man your roommate allowed, even if you text them to check. But the most important, your roommate should have asked you first, not just inform (wich wasn't done as well), and if you didn't allow this unattended guest, he is not supposed to be in your apartment. You waited too long to kick him out.", "Absolutely NTA. Even if this person was a woman, you would still have good reason to feel uneasy about sleeping under the same roof if they are a complete stranger to you. It's your home - you have a right to feel safe. Your housemate should not have invited this guy over without clearing it with you first - they were totally unreasonable.", "NTA, but a really strange story overall. next time - text your roommate directly when you see the person. Why did you allow a stranger in your house for 3 hours? This seems like the weirdest part.", "NTA.  You have a shitty roommate.  How about a phone call to say \"Hey is it ok with you if my friend Jeff stays over?\"  Otherwise there was just a creep you didn't know in your house at night.  \n\nHow did this guy even get into your place?  Does he have keys?", "First of all you tell your roomate that this isn't a hotel, it's a SHARED living space. If she wants to leave randos then she should move out alone, and then you don't give a fuck if she invites Jason, Freddy and Chucky, just not in YOUR home. Second: look for an other roomate or the posibility of living alone, this type of ppl only brings problems, and u should try to live life as confortable as you can.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I was in a similar situation years ago, and the guy wouldn\u2019t leave without me and my friends kicking up a stink. It was so uncomfortable and infuriating to have a stranger in the house who decided to make himself at home. I nearly called the police. \n\nYou are absolutely NTA.", "NTA and no you can never accept anything like this. Huge red flag! And don't ever stall your actions again...like whattt...you let him stay those hours. You need to learn to act on your feelings and to be firm when your instincts say: NO", "NTA but how did he get in? If he has a key, locking the door won't help. \n\nMy suggestion is definitely stay with family or a friend until she gets back and you can talk to her.", "NTA he never should have been there in the first place if your roommate wasn't home.", "Oh HELL NAW!! You don\u2019t have to be nice. You deserve to feel comfortable and safe in you own space. Period. No more explanations needed. \n\nThis is where you live. This is not some public rest spot for your roommate\u2019s people to stay in. Safe trumps nice ALL THE TIME. Please put your mind at ease about this because you were not rude, your roommate was for putting you in this situation. Your response was reasonable, logical, appropriate. Too bad for the stranger, but you have to look after yourself first.", "NTA. They shouldn\u2019t be leaving people there alone regardless of texting you.", "I would have told him to leave when I got there and if he didn't want to I would have gladly called the police to escort him out. But thats me. Also I hope you were able to snap a photo of him, because if he's not your roommates friend, and actually is someone who wanted to do you harm, that would definitely come in handy for the police...\n\nYou are 100% NTA. And you should really consider either getting a new roommate or getting cameras in your personal and shared spaces plus have a roommates agreement signed. How do you know he didn't steal anything or do any creepy stuff to your rooms? \n\nKeep us updated if your roommate says anything.", "NTA. This is not ok.. your roommate is AH", "NTA.

You did the right thing better safe than sorry!!", "NTA. Depending on what state you live in, your roommate could have gotten the stranger killed due to self defense laws.\n\nAlso, the dude was incrementally asking for more and more.

She won\u2019t be popular with her friends for long if she decides to pull these stunts. \n\nIf I were you I would also go to a women only self defence class, maybe do several of them. In my opinion it\u2019s not so much about the physical aspect of them but actually being told that you are allowed to use the word \u2018NO\u2019 and to stand your ground with people who don\u2019t respect your boundaries. This is a skill that can be learned.", "Change the code or call the building manager/whoever to change it for you saying you had a strange man in your apartment and you have no confirmation at all that your room mate knew them.\n\nThis could be someone who was there to say attack your room mate and copied down the pin or something. Even if he was there 'with' permission of your room mate they crossed a massive boundary and compromised your safety. Make sure your place is secure, when they get back they can call building manager or you to get code if you aren't in.", "Seriously, if your roommate is letting people stay in the house with no prior agreement that it's okay and without even bothering to give you the tiniest heads-up text to let you know what you're walking into, then your roommate does not concern herself with your safety or comfort in the slightest.

You literally had no idea who this man was. And when he was still there, you should\u2019ve just called the police, don\u2019t confront him or tell him, just do it. \n\nYour roommate is an idiot savant. You don\u2019t do this to people.

I can't even finish reading this comment because **seriously**??", "This incident was 100% inappropriate for any housing situation.  Guests should not be allowed over if their host is not present!

Say no and stand firm. Glad you are safe. You and your roommate have some talking to do.", "NTA.\n\nYour roommate is insane and a massive idiot to leave a strange man behind in your apartment.

Yikes,", "NTA and since I live in the US, there is a good chance I would have shot him. I would have absolutely called the police and fuck your friend for not telling you he was gonna be there. I would have let 5-0 come and sort out why the man is in my home. I can\u2019t believe you even asked him why he was there instead of immediately seeking safety and calling the police. Jesus, go take a self defense class if your plan is to just have conversations with stranger who potentially broke into your home, that way you have a chance of fighting them off when they attack you. Edited for clarification.", "Nope nope nope. Your roommate is the complete asshole here. Even if she was THERE she would be an asshole, let alone not being there with a fucking strange man. Nope NTA.

But get some assertiveness training. This cannot happen again.", "NTA. If you were uncomfortable, THAT'S what matters. Especially in your safe space. I wouldn't let a strange man sleep in my apartment if I was there alone. You come first. Your comfort and safety, (especially in your own home) comes first.

You are NTA OP. This screams red flags everywhere, and you need to consider getting a new roommate if at all possible. Who the hell does that to a roommate? Is she mental?", "NTA. It is inappropriate for a roommate to be inviting people over when they are not present themselves. Male, female, that\u2019s unimportant. This is a common sense thing, you don\u2019t need to justify this with any of the other details. The fact that you\u2019re having such strong feelings afterwards suggests that you struggle with unhealthy boundaries.

Don't be apologetic to her or she'll walk all over you, engaging in these kinds of social respectability politics gets women killed.", "Time to put your foot down. This is unacceptable.

Please work on standing up for yourself.", "OP, listen to me and repeat it to yourself again and again if necessary:\n\nNo portion of this was your fault. YOU are not a loser in the slightest. Your fear of men likely comes from a very genuine place/experience. Just because you didn't get every single reaction correctly in this instance doesn't mean you're a failure; on the contrary, as you pushed for what you needed to feel safe even though it went completely against your self-protective instinct to avoid confrontation. **This dude** is the creep loser who needs to learn how to behave.", "Roommate was completely selfish, when they left, guest should also have left. \nThey were oblivious to respecting your agreement.

If I were you I would already be planning to get her out regardless of what she says.", "Have you actually spoken to or texted with the roommate to confirm the guy\u2019s story? What has she said by way of explanation? NTA. She put you in a very vulnerable spot.", "Op inform the landlord . I doubt he/she would be thrilled to know unknown people are in the apartment or possibly have the code. The landlord can set a really hard boundary for your roommate", "Hahahahahahahaha you've never heard of women being told to downplay? You are either a unicorn or a man.", "The downplaying thing usually comes from people who are in their immediate circles, so close friends, relationships, family, and while yes, it's especially men, it can also be women.

How much is your peace of mind worth to you?

I lived in a similar situation for less than 3 weeks and ended up fleeing after she gave a sketchy dude a key and he threatened me. The police won't help you if you call because these people have permission from at least one tenant of the property, so if it somehow manages to escalate further, your only option is to leave.\n\nStart saving and prepping now, and if possible, look for housing in a bit more rural of an area. It tends to be cheaper than cities and therefore easier to afford. I pay around $100 more for my current 2br place than I did sharing a 2br in a city. I live in a HCOL state and my first place I found after the move was a $700/mo studio with utilities included. There's not as much to do but it's safer than living with someone who would turn you into an episode of Dateline without a second thought.", "I understand, BUT that doesn\u2019t mean you have to tolerate this.  I get the whole fear of confrontation/people pleasing thing, absolutely, but you are ignoring your gut feeling and letting other people cross your boundaries.  That is a very bad idea, because it puts you in situations like this where you feel bad/guilty for having basic rights, ignore your own discomfort, and end up in potential danger.\n\nYou have the right to feel safe in your own home.  Just keep repeating that.  Your roommate is absolutely out of order.  When she comes back, you are going to have to put your big girl pants on and say \u201cThat was completely unacceptable and must NOT happen again.
