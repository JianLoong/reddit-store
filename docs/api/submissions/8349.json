We aren't close friends or anything but we get along, keep clean, and pay rent on time. I am originally from the rural midwest and the stereotype that people are mean in NY is very true. I was always considered the darker odd one in the midwest because I preferred to not talk to people but in NY it seems to extreme. I'm fine with it but if someone walks in your eyeline and you smile at them they will look at you like you're insane. Where I come from you could encounter a random stranger anywhere and have a long indepth conversation with them. Just in general people are nicer. In the winter if I got off from my job at 9 and another person got off at 7. If they saw it snowed but it stopped snowing they would brush the snow and scrape the ice off my car. I'd do the same for a coworker. In NY people get offended when you say \"ma'am\" or \"sir\" but in the rural midwest or south people get offended if you don't say that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently my roommate's girlfriend stayed over during a snowstorm. My roommate doesn't have a car but his gf does. The snow died down after a couple of days and when I went out to leave in the morning I brushed the snow off my car and also did the same to the girlfriend's car. I also shoveled enough snow so that we could both back out. I didn't even say I did it or mention it. But when I got back home in the night my roommate looked upset. He was like \"never do that shit again.\" I didn't even know what he was talking about and when I asked him to clarify he just said \"you know.\" Eventually he told me that brushing snow and scraping ice off other people's cars is weird. I told him that it's not even a big deal and it's just a nice thing to do. I asked if his gf was pissed about it or something and he said that she was happy and pointed out how I am always a really nice person. Is this weird to do? I don't think brushing snow off someone's car after you do your is weird or makes me the asshole", "created_utc": 1674758834, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lz651/aita_for_scraping_the_ice_and_snow_off_of_my/", "score": 2720, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Born and raised in rural NY- this is a low class, bum fuck, jealous white conservative dude thing\n\nCleaning off my mom's car when she lived across the street is how my dad got in my mom's good graces.

You made him look like a dick and he is taking it out on you.", "NTA\n\nAnd no you did not run into a NY faux pas. You ran into classic boyfriend (your roommate) is not helpful or kind to girlfriend and is now being compared to you and losing. Most clearing of snow etiquette is the same in NYC, I would just avoid touching cars when you do not know the owner.\n\nFYI, the smiling thing is not mean it is a difference in social expectations. In the midwest it is rude to not socialize and treat the people you run into as cogs in the machine. In NY it is rude to take up people's time unnecessarily. Take a bank teller, it can be rude to treat them as just a means to your end and not treat them as a human to talk to and ask about their day. In a city, it is rude to make them chit chat with every person they have to interact with just because they have a job. It is also rude to slow down the line for everyone after you when in a crowded city.", "NTA but I think you helping out his girlfriend made him feel insecure. That\u2019s probably something he wanted to do and viewed that as a flirtatious move.", "Wow, it sounds like they have a really stable relationship. (Not). You did a kind and incredibly decent thing. NTA. Not even a little bit. Your roommate sounds jealous that he didn't think to do it first. Be careful, though, as he sounds a little emotionally unhinged and controlling.", "NTA, but also, I don\u2019t know where you are living in NY, but it definitely isn\u2019t any place that I have lived (LI, Queens, the City).  \n\nPeople will help with snow removal from cars, sidewalks, and driveways all over the place (even street parked on the upper west side). I have had tons of conversations with people on train/subway platforms, the bus, hell even waiting in lines at CVS, and no one has looked at me strangely for saying Sir or Maam (unless I\u2019m saying it to some really young people). \n\nIf this is the environment you are in, I would move because that isn\u2019t a good area to live in.", "NTA, but I also think its good to learn and accept that what is acceptable in one area might not be in another. I'm from California, and if someone did that (if we did get snow) it'd be a bit creepy because they'd be all up and around my car able to see whats inside and because I don't know what they'd want in return. It was a nice gesture and your roommate went overboard with his reaction, but most people in New York would find it a bit odd or unsettling and thats okay. Its just differences in culture.", "Nta but I hate how people from the rural Midwest think everyone there is the nicest and people elsewhere are mean. The most fake people I\u2019ve ever met are from the rural Midwest", "NAH\n\nI can understand why he was upset, you kinda showed him up. His reaction almost makes him TA.\n\nI am from the west so I do not see anything even slightly weird about this. I am out there removing snow from my car, if I have time and I know they will be out there in a bit why wouldnt I get their car too. I am already cold, snow covered, and have all the stuff.", "Nta your roommates poor little ego is bruised.

But we still call the state Washington State.", "I\u2019ve visited NYC a bunch of times and although people you pass on the street or see on public transport appear to be unfriendly, you have to remember that the city is really crowded, and if you can\u2019t maintain any physical space, you can at least make yourself some mental space. But when I tripped and fell face-first in the middle of an intersection (manhole cover not flush), it wasn\u2019t just my bf helping me up. Someone handed me my sunglasses before I even noticed they\u2019d fallen off."]}
