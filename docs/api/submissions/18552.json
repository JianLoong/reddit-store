I thought you he request was so weird In the first place, because my husband and I pool our money - so he will essentially be \u201cgoing in\u201d on his own gift. So I said ok with the intention of not offering an even split when the price was announced. The trouble is she has not talked about any pricing and I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s very expensive. Not something I would have chosen on my own and I\u2019m worried she\u2019s going to go ahead and buy it without even asking me how much I\u2019m comfortable contributing.\n\nThe only question she\u2019s asked is if I \u201clike\u201d it - which I said yes I did - but I thought she would follow up with a price tag after but she didn\u2019t. I had to go looking on line as it appears she is getting closer to purchasing it as she asked about some options - again without mentioning a cost. \n\nAITA for being annoyed at her? Like I feel she is being very entitled and tone deaf and if this goes sideways it\u2019s definitely on her for even thinking she should request money from our household for a gift for him in the first place.\n\nUPDATE: acknowledging the responses here - I approached her politely and asked \u201chow much is this going to cost?\u201d I then reminded her that graduate school is costly so I am watching our spending. My cursory searches on Google indicate this is a gift worth thousands of dollars. She simply said \u201coh don\u2019t worry about the cost just give what you can\u201d which also did not make me feel comfortable\u2026. I didn\u2019t like how that made me feel. So I replied that \u201cwithout knowing the price I can\u2019t estimate what would be fair\u201d and I don\u2019t want to insult her with a really low amount. I said I would just decline to contribute and get him something on my own that way I won\u2019t have to worry I didn\u2019t \u201cput in\u201d the right amount\u2026.

It's perfectly normal to celebrate this with a significant gift, and given that gifts for things like a graduate school graduation are usually expensive and meaningful (my mum's parents bought my dad a very expensive watch that he still wears over 50 years later when he graduated law school, for example), it makes sense that they would ask if you wanted to get something for him together, as a family. \n\nAs for the fact that your finances are shared . . . so what?

Can we look at some less expensive options?\u201d Then she can either offer alternate options or tell you that she doesn\u2019t mind covering the rest.", "Why didn\u2019t you ask? I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re an adult and don\u2019t need your parent to call for you.", "Tell her you looked up the price and it's more than you're comfortable spending. \n\nYou say you don't want to look like a b in front of his family, but what do you think you're going to look like when you knew you weren't going to pay her even before she bought the gift.", "Did you ask?", ">She has not expressed the price\n\nAND YOU HAVE NOT EXPRESSED ANY INTEREST IN KNOWING THE PRICE\n\nShe asked for your input on the gift, and you STILL didn't ask her the price??\n\n\"Do you like it?\" is not asking *only* \"do you think it's pretty?\" It's asking \"Do you like THIS OPTION for his gift?\"\n\nIf you needed to know the price of the gift before you could say if that was a gift you would like to give, then YOU NEEDED TO *ASK* THE PRICE or at least EXPRESS your concerns *about* the price.", "Did you 'express' that you wanted to know the price before agreeing to \"go in\"?\n\nAs I say to my 3 year old. Use your words.\n\nYTA", "Why press her? Can\u2019t you just talk to her? It\u2019s a joint present. It\u2019s very normal to inform about the price etc. There\u2019s no need to press her on anything.", "It's not rude.  You never indicated that it was an issue, and didn't ask any questions.  I'm sensing that your SIL and maybe their family is direct and maybe even entitled, but instead of ever clarifying or having an actual conversation about things you just stew and stew and stew and never actually say anything.  This is not working for you.  Next time they suggest something, the answer isn't \"Oh my gosh I absolutely must just say yes or they'll something something something about me\", the answer is \"Can you give me some more details about that so I can make a decision?\"\n\nAlso, it's not 'pressing' her.  You seem to view regular back and forth communication as something to be avoided.  You're a grownup, use your words.", "It's not rude? Like, it'd be rude if you asked for more detail, and she refused to give it. THAT is rude. But it doesn't sound like she's intentionally leaving anything out; you're just not asking and somehow making that her fault.", "She might be annoyed that she\u2019s doing all the legwork on the gift and you are barely participating", "You haven\u2019t given yourself that chance. She doesn\u2019t have the ability to mind read so stop blaming others for you not being able to speak up.", "How did she stop you from limiting your contribution?", "You could have just said thanks but no thanks. You are doing something on your own. Now it\u2019s too late for that, but FFS communicate. Ask her how much it is and let her know you have a budget of X so that\u2019s the max you\u2019ll be able yo contribute. This whole uncommunicative expecting people to read your mind is ridiculous.", "It's a simple conversation. You either decline the offer or accept and tell your sister in law your budget. If you're not going to speak up for yourself, who will?", "You're making a rod for your own back by failing to communicate. You don't have to wait for it to be brought up, and you will look like an AH if you say yes, and then, once the item is bought, you then back out on contributing. \n\nIt's a simple text. \"Hey, I know we're going in on this gift, but unfortunately, I've looked at my finances, and I can only afford to contribute x amount. If you are comfortable with that, then I'm happy to contribute. If that amount isn't enough, I'm more than happy to back out and buy a separate gift that is within my budget. Either way, I really appreciate you looking for the gift, and I know husband will love it, and I look forward to celebrating his success with you all.\"\n\nThat puts the ball in your in-laws' court, and if they ask why you didn't mention it earlier, be honest and say you felt uncomfortable bringing up money. If they ask why you can't afford more, say that you both pool finances and you'd have to dig into his share of your joint finances to be able to afford it, and you don't want him paying for his own gift. Honesty is your best course of action, and you need to learn to open the communication up rather than waiting for it to happen.", ">but she really hasn\u2019t given me the chance to do that\n\nShe gave you the chance WHEN SHE ASKED if you wanted to contribute: \"Yes, I'd love to. How much were you thinking?\"/\"Yes, but money is tight right now so I wouldn't be able to give more than X.\"\n\nShe gave you *another* chance when she ASKED YOU what you thought about the gift she was thinking about getting: \"That's a great gift idea! How much will it be?\"", "You SIL isn't you. Her thought process is different. She ASKED you, she didn't tell you to go in together on a gift. It was your prerogative to say no, or ask for more information.\n\nTalk. to. her.\n\nSet your expectations or gracefully bow out with an apology for not discussing it more. If you wait until after it's purchased to 'be annoyed', then yeah YTA.", "That\u2019s not strange at all. Asking around within your family to go in a joint present is a very very common thing. I\u2019ve often given joint presents with my SIL and BIL.\n\nBut that actually is totally irrelevant. You are 100% in the wrong, because you failed to say no or communicate in any way and have the audacity to blame your SIL.", ">Is it not strange to say \u201coh I\u2019m going to get a gift for my brother. Hey - I think his wife should help pay for it - those two are doing alright, they can contribute\u201d\n\nI don't think that's the mindset most people have when buying gifts. If I'm going to get something big for someone and the event is significant it's not unheard of to see if friends or family want to contribute. It's also fine if they say no. If this isn't something you like why would not say so? Why agree to go in on the gift, you could easily say no?", "She thought your husband would like one bigger gift instead of two smaller ones. There is nothing wrong with asking if you thought so too.

I am not sure you know what the word means.", "Sorry you have to put up with that.  It will continue until you consistently say \"**no!**\"  It will get easier over time.  Always remember, it is easier to change a *no* into a *yes*, so start with ***no***.", "No, honey...\n\n>If OP can't handle giving an honest answer to it, she needs therapy.\n\nThe \"she\" in \"she needs therapy\" in the comment above is YOU.\n\nThis is not about SIL being \"entitled,\" this is about you not being able to have a conversation.\n\nIt sounds like you have an EXTREMELY indirect style of communication, where you think you're not allowed to provide any information unless you are directly *asked* to give information about *the specific thing* -- like when SIL asked if you liked the gift, and you answered \"yes\" AND NOTHING ELSE because you thought the gift was pretty, and, *to you,* she had \"only\" asked if the gift was pretty and didn't *specifically* ask if you thought this was a good option for the joint gift or if you would like to get that gift for your husband.\n\nShe probably has a more direct style if communication, where if she wants or needs something, she will *use her words* and *say it,* even if nobody asked her first.\n\nTo you, asking for what one wants is rude/\"entitled\"; because the \"polite\" thing to do is to wait until someone *offers* you something.\n\nTo many people, asking for what one wants is the expected norm, and the most efficient way to accomplish anything, because it doesn't rely on expecting others to read your mind so they can \"offer\" the thing you want but won't ask for.\n\nIf there's one last slice of pizza, and I still want pizza but everyone else seems to be done eating, I can ask, \"Does anyone want the last slice of pizza?\"\n\nThat's \"polite\", but it's also setting me up for failure -- because *I* want the last slice, and if I *offer it to others,* that implies that I *don't* want it (that's why I'm giving it away).\n\nI could ask, \"Does anyone else want the last slice of pizza or can I have it?\"\n\nNow I've let others know that I *do* want the pizza, so if someone else also wanted it, we could split it or work something else out.\n\nIt's not \"entitled\" to ask, \"Is it okay if I take the last slice?\" or \"Can I have the last slice?\"\n\nTo you, this probably sounds \"entitled\", because it assumes nobody else wants it... but if everyone else looks like they're done eating, and nobody else has asked about the remaining slice, it's a reasonable assumption that nobody else probably wants the last slice.\n\nAsking if I can have it, as opposed to just *taking* the last slice, is not rude or entitled or impolite.\n\nAsking for what you want or need is not \"entitled.\"\n\n*Demanding* what you want, or throwing a tantrum when you are not given what you want, is entitled.\n\nLook up direct and indirect communication and \"ask culture\" v \"offer culture\". Your life will be much better, and way less stressful, if you learn to be more assertive.\n\nYour relationships will also improve once you start to see that asking questions and stating one's needs are not signs of \"entitlement\", but rather signs of healthy communication.", "You probably had a budget in mind for your husband's gift, why not go with that? Trying to figure out how to phrase this, but is your SIL the condescending savior type or are your insecurities around money causing you to read a lot of negative into her trying to be kind?", "You\u2019re giving every excuse in the book to not discuss critical details with SIL. Part of pooling funds together to buy something is discussing what each person can reasonably contribute, and you\u2019re letting your insecurities run rampant to the point you make up details in your head to rationalize not saying anything.\n\nIf you\u2019re not comfortable or unwilling to discuss necessary details, or even communicate with SIL, then do yourself a favor and drop out. Stop leading your SIL on about this. You say you have no choice, but you do.
