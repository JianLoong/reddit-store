I (45F) am currently on a family cruise with my husband (48M) and our three children: a 13-year-old daughter, a 15-year-old son, and an 18-year-old daughter, whom I'll refer to as \"Sarah\" for this post. We thought it would be a great opportunity to bond as a family and have some fun together before Sarah heads off to college in the fall. However, things have taken a turn for the worse, and I need your advice to know if I'm in the wrong.\n\nA few nights ago, Sarah met a guy (also 18) in the teen club on the ship. They hit it off and have been spending a lot of time together since then. At first, I didn't think much of it. I figured it was just a harmless crush, and she would still want to spend time with the family. However, as the days went by, she started spending less and less time with us and more time with him.\n\nTo be clear, I have no issue with her making friends and having a good time on the cruise. But I do have an issue with her neglecting her family and spending all her time with this guy. We're paying a lot of money for this cruise, and it's meant to be a family vacation, not a romantic getaway for Sarah.\n\nYesterday, I finally reached my breaking point. I confronted Sarah and told her that she needs to spend more time with the family and less time with this guy. I even suggested that she should stay in the cabin except for family excursions to keep them separated. She was understandably upset and accused me of being overbearing and controlling. But I feel like I'm just trying to protect her and our family vacation.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for restricting my daughter from spending time with a guy she met on a family cruise? I need your honest opinions, and I'm willing to accept any criticism if it means making things right.", "created_utc": 1677693063, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11faa2m/aita_for_separating_my_daughter_from_a_guy_she/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA for suggesting this", "**YTA** \\- for confining your child to the cabin except family excursions.\n\nHonestly, what your daughter is doing sounds pretty normal (and much more fun for her than hanging out with family). To me, it just sounds like you need to have a talk with your daughter and come up with a compromise. X time with family and Y time for your own adventures (within reason). Communciation and compromise are key here.", "YTA. Of course you are. She should stay in the cabin...alone? Are you saying you'd be off doing something and she needs to be in the cabin to keep her from this guy? What happened to \"FaMiLy TiMe\"?", "YTA. She\u2019s 18. Do you not remember how exciting it is to meet other people on vacation? \n\nYou\u2019re so hyper focused on what she\u2019s doing Id bet you\u2019re also not having quality time with your family\n\nAnd congrats, your grown daughter will now never agree to go on vacation with you again. Gold star \u2b50\ufe0f", "YTA for saying she should stay in the room. That makes it clear this is a control thing, and not a \"spend time with your family\" thing. Also, you're on a one way track to ensure she never wants to go on a family vacation with you again.", "> I even suggested that she should stay in the cabin except for family excursions to keep them separated. \n\nYTA\n\nThat has nothing to do with family time and everything to do with you controlling her.", "YTA she is 18. She is growing up. This is a perfectly natural thing for her to do. \n\nPerhaps instead of trying to force Sarah to spend family time with you, you should focus on preparing yourself and your family for her inevitable independence.", ">I confronted Sarah and told her that she needs to spend more time with the family and less time with this guy. I even suggested that she should stay in the cabin except for family excursions to keep them separated. She was understandably upset and accused me of being overbearing and controlling. But I feel like I'm just trying to protect her and our family vacation.\n\nSorry but, YTA. \n\nYou daughter is 18. You can speak with her about what you hope for during the vacation but you cannot force her to participate in family time...trying to do so will absolutely drive her into the guy's arms. \n\nThis will not turn out to be a happy family vacation if you're forcing her to be part of it.  All you can really do is express disappointment that she's leaving the family behind in favor of a dude she just met.  You can't control her, you can invite her. That's about it.", "YTA \n\nYou had me right up to \u201cstay in the cabin when not with family outings to keep them separate\u201d. That made it clear it was less about family time and more about keeping them apart. \n\nIf you had merely said something along the lines of \u201cHey it\u2019s great you made a friend but remember we\u2019re on a family vacation. You need to make time for us as well and we would like you to join us for xyz event\u201d you would have been totally in the clear.", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s 18! Some parameters are reasonable (like one family meal per day, she returns to the cabin to sleep, regular checking in etc.) Otherwise, let her have fun!\n\nThis could be a trip she remembers fondly as a fun family trip where she met a guy and had a great time, or it could be a trip that seeds resentment towards you and travel. Your call.", "YTA. She\u2019s 18, she\u2019s going to meet guys and go out with friends. If you want her to spend time with the family that\u2019s understandable- so set a schedule and let her know when you\u2019d like her to be present and work out a compromise. Restricting an 18 year old to the cabin is ridiculous- how is that what your vacation is intended for? If you have plans as a family, talk to her about joining in. But if you just are having free time, why does it matter where she spends it- free time should be hers to spend however she wants. Stop treating her like a child and TALK to her. Set a schedule and explain why you want her to join the family and when. And then leave her be. \n\nRestricting her freedom now will basically guarantee she never comes home once she goes to school- why would she?", "YTA. You don\u2019t care if she makes friends but she has to spend time with family and also can\u2019t leave the cabin? Are you guys just spending time together as a family in your cabin all day? That doesn\u2019t sound like a fun vacation!", "I was on your side until you told her to stay in the cabin. YTA. \n>\nHad you told her that you wanted to have dinner together as a family or do a few family activities together every day, that would\u2019ve been OK. But this is way too controlling!", "She is 18. It is a little late to bond with her now.\n\nAnd pressure is not the way bonding works.\n\nYTA", "YTA. \nAsking her to balance her time more evenly between you was perfectly fine. Basically grounding her by demanding she stay in her ~~cell~~ cabin and only ~~be let out for approved visitors~~ leave it to hang out with you was wayyy out of line. \n\nAnd if I may add it may help to make the time she *does* spend with you more enjoyable? I obviously don't know how you spent your time together, but it's something to consider.", "YTA. You make no mention of them doing anything dangerous or shady. She is 18 years old. If the family is just sitting in the cabin, why shouldn\u2019t she go out and enjoy herself? \n\nYou are being overbearing. It is not wrong for you to ask her to spend more time with the family, but it is unfair of you to expect her to want to spend every single minute with you.\n\nWould you be reacting this way if Sarah just wanted time alone to sit by the pool?", "YTA and let me spell the reasons why:\n\n1. Your daughter is an adult. If she wants to hang out with someone on a cruise that's her choice. That's what 99% of young adults do on cruises. \n\n2. What exactly do you expect your 18 year old to do with the family on a cruise that you require so much of her time? She already goes on family excursions. \n\n>I even suggested that she should stay in the cabin except for family excursions to keep them separated\n\n3. So which is it? Do you want to keep them separated or do you want her to spend time with family? Because your above statement says that you want to keep her trapped in the cabin outside of excursions. And if your family is spending all their time in the cabin outside of excursions then you're wasting your money. \n\nCongratulations on making this \"family vacation\" absolutely miserable for her. This might be the last one she might ever take with you.", "YTA. I wouldn't want to be around you either", "INFO: Does this guy seem sketchy? Has he done anything wrong?\n\nOtherwise, YTA. You could've just had a conversation and said \"I'd like for you to spend more time with us,\" NOT \"I'd like for you to spend less time with him.\"", "YTA, your daughter is 18, an adult, you can't really stop her from doing anything. Would it be nice if she spent her time with the family, yes.\n\nBut you should communicate that you want to spend more time with her, instead of trying to exert control over what she does.", ">\"I even suggested that she should stay in the cabin except for family excursions to keep them separated.\"\n\nBruh....\n\nYTA", "\"I even suggested that she should stay in the cabin except for family excursions to keep them separated.\"\n\nHow is this abou her spending time with the family? This is clearly about preventing her from seeing that guy. \n\nThis is absolutely overbearing and controlling.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. That's how you get Sarah to not call or visit while she's in college.\n\nYour daughter is 18, about to enter college, where she will be away from family and surrounded by strangers, her making friends with someone who is likely on the same boat is a perfect way to prepare herself for what is to come, instead of \"I don't care about that friend or yours, you have to spend time with us and you will be happy about it\" attitude you could have adopted a \"\u00bfWho is X? \u00bfIs he also going to college? \u00bfWhy don't you invite him over?\" to try and incorporating your kid and what she wants to do in your cruise thingy.", "YTA, sure it\u2019s reasonable to want her to spend more time with family. You could have a conversation about that instead of trying to control your daughter who is a legal adult by the way and policing who she spends time with.", "Where you went wrong was telling her to stay in the cabin. How in the world you thought keeping her inside the cabin on a cruise was a reasonable suggestion over spending time with a friend boggles my mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*We're paying a lot of money for this cruise, and it's meant to be a family vacation.*\n\nThis statement above made sense. If you wanted to emphasize that, you would have let her know that you booked a family trip specifically to enjoy this time with her before she goes to college, and ask her to join you for X, Y, Z - excursions, dinners, breakfasts, for example. \n\nBut also consider respecting your daughter as a young adult who wants some independence, and allow her to have time with her friend/crush. Lunches and a show on the ship, or time hanging at the pool between ports. Harmless hanging out. \n\nYou absolutely went \"overboard' on this one. \n\nYTA.", ">I even suggested that she should stay in the cabin except for family excursions to keep them separated.\n\nThis is where you lost me. Asking Sarah to spend more time with the family is one thing; isolating her is just controlling and puts you firmly into YTA territory.", "YTA. She is legally an adult now its time to treat her like one", "OP, what exactly do you think you\u2019re \u201cprotecting\u201d her from? She\u2019s 18\u2026it\u2019s perfectly normal for an 18yo to date. Leave her alone. YTA.", "YTA. I bet she can\u2019t wait to get away in the fall. I understand cruises are expensive, but she is 18 and enjoying her time. The money isn\u2019t going to waste.", "YTA.  Why couldn't you simply ask Sarah for more of her time?  Punishing her for a shipboard romance is just excessive.", "YTA\n\nStay in the cabin?  What a wonderful family vacation that will be.  \n\nIf she met a guy and hung out with him and had fun, she'd be thankful that her parents took her on this vacation and gave her an opportunity she otherwise wouldn't have had to enjoy herself. \n\nIf you demand she sit in the room except for the once every day or two you go off ship to do some prescribed activity, she's going to think you are overbearing and controlling, and when she goes to school she will be thrilled to flee those aspects of you.\n\nThose very aspects which assuredly do not exist exclusively on a cruise ship but in many aspects of your relationship with her.", "YTA stop with the fake cruise fanfics already Jesus", "That\u2019s just what 18 year olds do.  You can ask for specific events to be spent with family, but grounding her for all the rest of the time?  What did she do wrong?  And forcing her to spend more time with you will only mean you\u2019re spending it with a surly, grumpy teenager, and then no one\u2019s happy.  Minimize what you\u2019re asking of her, let her have fun, and go find some fun for yourself. YTA if you don\u2019t back off.", "Soft YTA. I don't get the sense that you are generally controlling, and it makes sense you'd want to spend this time with her. Perhaps have a conversation with her and tell her you wanted to take this trip to spend extra time with her before she leaves. Maybe ask her to set aside some time daily to spend with just the family, and then she can do whatever she likes. Keeping her in the cabin would be miserable for her and she would likely be resentful.", "Keep her in the cabin unless she's with you?  At 18?  Let her have a little vacation crush. If it was the 13 yo, that would make more sense.  Give her some freedom and independence or she'll never take another Vacation with you.", "So spend more time with the family and when the family isn\u2019t doing anything spend time by yourself in the cabin? Riiight. YTA", "YTA\n\nNobody puts Sarah in the corner, er, cabin.", "YTA. What will get out of forcing her to be with you when she really want to be, other than of course her resentment?  You go on about how this is supposed to be making memories before she goes to college\u2014what do you think her memory would be?  \n\nThat she met a guy who she had a really good time with, really enjoyed his company, and got a big teenage crush (which are powerful). Then her asshole, controlling manipulative mother came along, threw her authority around and took it away and she never saw him again. All while her asshole mother was insisting so they could have \u201cfamily fun\u201d and \u201cmake memories.\u201d  On what planet do you think she\u2019s going to say \u201cwow mom, you were right!  I\u2019m so glad that you bossed me out of this, treated me like a child and kept me from enjoying myself.\u201d\n\nThe only thing that rivals your selfishness is your short-sightedness. Also one other thing. Your daughter is on the cusp of being independent from you. \n\nParents always seem totally and completely flabbergasted that their children remember their mistreatment when they turn into adults and have it affect their adult relationships with their kids. As if there is some grand memory wipe at 19 or so. \n\nYou have to start respecting your daughter\u2019s autonomy if you want to have a healthy relationship with her since that relationship is going to be totally optional from her perspective in a few short years, if not less. \n\nOne other thing. You say that this is to \u201cprotect\u201d. That\u2019s just a bold faced lie. You probably are so used to lying to Sarah to manipulate her and make excuses for yourself that you forget that unlike your kids, we can freely tell you that you\u2019re full of it when you try to peddle horseshit like that. Be better.", "YTA - Haven't you ever seen Titanic?  You are keeping her from the love of her life!!!\n\nSeriously, she's 18 years old and you want to send her to her room like a toddler?  Have you always been this controlling and toxic?  She's a legal adult, even inside national waters, and can do anything she likes.  If you don't want to end up on the wrong end of a no contact situation, you might want to stop acting like the reincarnation of a prison warden and ask your daughter nicely for more of her time to be spent with the family.  If she says no, and after your latest I wouldn't blame her, you might just want to accept that and give her time to cool off.  The lack of respect her for her adult autonomy is really horrible.", "This has to be fake...stay in the cabin except for family excursions? Frankly, that sounds pretty horrible! \n\nIf not, YTA. Big time. The Teen Club set up on cruises is a great idea. They had it on the Disney Cruise we were on. Our teens had a great time there, and we certainly didn't feel \"neglected.\" We were glad the kids had places to be where they could enjoy themselves. \n\nI can understand your disappointment at not spending as much time with her, but guess what...she's growing up. She'll be moving on and will have her own life. You can't hold her back.\n\nLet her have her fun. Maybe her young man can have a meal with you some time, or you can spend time with him doing some kind of activity. But please, let her spend time w/him on her own. Otherwise, you're really going to make her feel resentful, and it'll be a trip she won't look back on with any happiness.", "YTA. The way you went about it is unfortunately more likely to make her resent her last family holiday than cherish the memories.", "YTA\n\nGrowing up in a family like this is the reason I decided I didn't want children. \n\nShe's an adult. You don't own her. If you would like her to spend more time with the family have a conversation with her about spending more time with the family. Tell her how you feel like adults talk to each other, that this is probably the last time you will probably all be together like this and it would mean so much to you and her siblings if you could at least schedule a few excursions and maybe a couple of dinner nights. Let her decide what she wants to do and hopefully she decides you are people she wants to spend some time with after knowing how you feel. \n\nOtherwise family can feel like a burden. Just because you made her doesn't mean she's forever chained to what you want to do because you said so.", "Of course you are!!!", "YTA. Instead of separating her from the guy you could just have discussed when you want her to be with the rest of the family. Family dinner, activities, etc\u2026 otherwise it shouldn\u2019t matter. Why would her being trapped in the cabin be better than her hanging out with someone else if the issue isn\u2019t her having made a friend? That alone just seems like a controlling move.", "I remember being controlled at 18. Basically don\u2019t even speak to my mom at now 40. Do you want that?", "YTA.  She's 18. What are you going to do when she goes off to college and starts making new friends?  Pull her out and lock her in her room?", "YTA. At 18 years old, your daughter is an adult. It sounds like you're not ready for her to grow up, family vacation or not. If you want her to spend more time with you then negotiate some time. Maybe have dinner together daily and figure out what sort of communal activities can be enjoyed and let the dude come (and encourage him to have his family along as well). This way she has freedom but you get time together.", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter is an adult. First of all, did you actually think an 18 year old has any of the same interests as people in their 40s or a 13 year old when you booked the cruise? That would be almost a miracle. Secondly, you should have booked more excursions, and included Sarah in planning them, if you wanted her to spend time with you. Finally - you're *grounding* an 18 year old? In a cruise ship's cramped room?!? Are you fer real here?!\n\nYou blew it.", "YTA. Your daughter is right. She can make her own decisions with her schedule. If you want her to accommodate the family then approach like any adult and ask her availability and you guys can work it out. Your role is changing as a mom to adult teen, you need to make more adjustments in communicating with her. Instead of dictating ask her like you would any other adult. It\u2019s about supporting and respecting her as a adult now. Let her take the lead, if you\u2019re a good mom she\u2019ll be back asking for your assistance. Just give her more space to make her own decisions.", "YTA, let the girl have fun.", "YTA. She's 18. Instead of allowing her to have a trip that is made of amazing memories for her, you're jealous that she's not choosing to spend her time with you. Grow up and allow her to be the 18 year old teen that she is.", "YTA. She's an adult.", "I can see you've forgotten what it was like to be young and on the cusp of adulthood, with all those teenage hormones racing through your body.  You're not really trying to protect her, she (was) having a ball.  You're trying to force her to enjoy the family holiday the way you think a family holiday should be enjoyed.  So yes, you're being controlling.  It is unfortunate she doesn't think in terms of what she might be missing of her family once she leaves for college, or it might just be a reflection of your family dynamics that you aren't ready to inspect.  YTA", "Feels like there has been a lot of cruise posts the past few days", "Yeah YTA. Your daughter, an ADULT for all intents and purposes, is finding a way to have fun on vacation.

Outline the events where you expect her to be available for family time. Maybe you expect her for breakfast, dinner, and the shows. Or you don't get up early and you expect her for excursions, lunch, and at least a couple hours of time at the pool. Just be very specific, very clear, and apologize for overreacting. Remind her that you already miss her and she isn't even off to college yet and tell her your overreaction was just you being emotional about her moving on with her life.", "Yta. She's 18, old enough to make her decisions. No 18 year old realistically wants to spend time with their parents. Atleast compromise with her", "YTA.  She's 18 years old.  Enforced family time is not going to help matters.  You handled this badly and need to make it right.", ">But I feel like I'm just trying to protect her and our family vacation.\n\nProtect her from what?  Or protect her virtue?  Are you afraid your little girl is going to have sex?  She's 18 and no longer needs your \"protection\".  She's an adult now.\n\nYes, she should be spending time with her family.  But locking her in the cabin on a cruise except for when you go out on excursions?  That's imprisonment and she could go to a crewmember about that and you'd be in a fuck load more trouble than you want to be.  \n\nYes, you are being controlling and over bearing.  YTA", "Who in their right mind would honestly believe an 18-year-old would want to hang out with her parents and siblings on a CRUISE? Especially one with people their own age around?\n\nFamily vacations are beach houses or camping trips or even theme parks, places where the family does everything together then returns to the accomodations together. Cruises aren't family vacations, they're \"have adventures, meet new people\" vacations.\n\nWhy in the world would she prefer spending the time with you guys when there's so much else to do on a cruise ship that a fledgeling adult learning to navigate the world would want to do?\n\nYou planned poorly, and sound hurt she's growing up and no longer centering your immediate family as the most important unit. It sucks. But locking her in the cabin and basically saying \"I spent all this money for you to be trapped with us and enjoy it\" is a losing battle.

Have you always been this controlling?", "Are we talking not coming back to your cabin or suite at night, or are we talking just off doing her own thing with this guy for most of the day?  If we're talking about the second, then YTA, or at least you are unrealistic.  She is legally an adult, and chronologically at a stage where she's biologically programmed to seek out new experiences and people her own age.  She is going to have her own friends and interests.  She's probably a little entitled and self-centered, but that's also biologically and chronologically appropriate, if not always pleasant for bystanders.   OTOH, if we're talking about the first one, I would have bigger concerns.  While she's legally an adult, hopefully she knows enough to be safe.", "YTA. You\u2019re being a control freak, and meddling for no good reason.

Asking for a friend in law enforcement.", "Yta.   It\u2019s reasonable to want to spend time as a family on a vacation.  It\u2019s unreasonable to confine her to the cabin just to keep her away from a boy she met.  The nice thing about cruising is the variety of activities.  Your kids are different ages and have different interests. Everyone doesn\u2019t have to do the same things all the time,  I think there is room for compromise.  I suggest having her do the shore excursions with the family and eat dinner as a family.    That gives you designated family time while still giving her some freedoms to choose her own activities at other times.", "YTA -  This reads more as control than having her best interest in mind.  Your daughter is 18 and a legal adult. \n\nI can understand wanting her to spend more time with the family since it is a family trip and honestly it would have been reasonable to have a conversation about this with her.  But instead you confronted her and put her on the spot and then suggested that she should spend the rest of the vacation in the cabin and not enjoy herself unless she was with you on an excursion.   Your treatment of your daughter in this situation makes some really big statements about you as an individual that may or may not be true, but don't look good like: \n\n1: you don't see or treat your daughter as an adult.   \n2: You prefer to parent with control over actually meaningful conversation and connection  \nand  \n3: You struggle to trust the judgement of others. \n\nIt was reasonable to ask her to do more with the family, it would have been reasonable to have a conversation about safety with this boy she met.  What isn't reasonable is to expect her to sit alone when she isn't with you.  This type of controlling behavior on the part of parents is what causes some kids to totally disengage from their family of origin when they go to college.  Sometimes that is to rebel but often it is to find a community where they feel valued, heard, and respected.   \n\nYour actions were the absolute worst way to handle this, your daughter is 18 and while developmentally she has a bit to go, legally she is an adult.  If I were you I would apologize for the suggestion she stay in the cabin the rest of the trip and bring the focus back on family NOT control.", "very soft YTA for telling her you\u2019d make her stay in the cabin to avoid him, but Nta for wanting to spend time with her. \n Just sit down and tell her you\u2019re going to miss her and wanted to spend this time with her, and that you appreciate she\u2019s having fun talking with him but that maybe she could spend half the day with him, half with the family?", "Not the cruise again", "Soft YTA. I get it, I really do. My own daughter is 19, and for the past 4ish years, I\u2019ve been beside myself, wanting her to spend time with family. I chose to pick my battles, though. I remember being a teenager, I remember what it\u2019s like trying to figure out who you are, and how to navigate both the world at large, and interpersonal relationships, both the friends and family. So I chose to let a lot of things go. I chose to allow her as much autonomy as I could, while also doing everything I could to keep her as safe as possible.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nHi, Reddit. I (45F) am currently on a family cruise with my husband (48M) and our three children: a 13-year-old daughter, a 15-year-old son, and an 18-year-old daughter, whom I'll refer to as \"Sarah\" for this post. We thought it would be a great opportunity to bond as a family and have some fun together before Sarah heads off to college in the fall. However, things have taken a turn for the worse, and I need your advice to know if I'm in the wrong.\n\nA few nights ago, Sarah met a guy (also 18) in the teen club on the ship. They hit it off and have been spending a lot of time together since then. At first, I didn't think much of it. I figured it was just a harmless crush, and she would still want to spend time with the family. However, as the days went by, she started spending less and less time with us and more time with him.\n\nTo be clear, I have no issue with her making friends and having a good time on the cruise. But I do have an issue with her neglecting her family and spending all her time with this guy. We're paying a lot of money for this cruise, and it's meant to be a family vacation, not a romantic getaway for Sarah.\n\nYesterday, I finally reached my breaking point. I confronted Sarah and told her that she needs to spend more time with the family and less time with this guy. I even suggested that she should stay in the cabin except for family excursions to keep them separated. She was understandably upset and accused me of being overbearing and controlling. But I feel like I'm just trying to protect her and our family vacation.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for restricting my daughter from spending time with a guy she met on a family cruise? I need your honest opinions, and I'm willing to accept any criticism if it means making things right.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "[removed]", "YTA duh", "YTA, but I understand your concern.  Your daughter is just reaching adulthood, which can is a very uncertain time for everyone.  However, she needs to be allowed to make her own decisions.  As long as she is safe and not being disrespectful, she should be allowed to develop relationships on a cruise.  She also might be annoyed in the future if her younger siblings end up having more freedom when they're 18 (i.e., because you will have already had an 18-year-old and will be more prepared this time), which could be taken as preferential treatment.  (I'm NOT accusing you of anything, just spitballing.  You're worried about your daughter and only want what's best for her.  I'm just a random idiot on Reddit.)", "YTA.\n\nIf she is not in any danger of physical harm, then you are lying to yourself and you are not, in fact, protecting her.

It is also disrespectful, and manipulative. You are taking away her freedom of choice...because she won't act like you want her to act?

You cant actually force her to do anything, she can leave the cabin if she wants, unless you want to be done for false imprisonment.\n\nWhat you should have done is actually talk to her like a mature person and explain why you want to limit thier interaction, completely banning her is going to do nothing but make you and controlling AH.", "YTA- let the girl enjoy herself.

You hate that so you literally want to imprison her in your room to force her to do what you want. Forcing her to spend time with you won't make her want to do it. You're not a good parent.

I see where you may be coming from as a mom of a newly ADULT teen. She's an adult now though, you will need to come to terms with this. You can't tell her to stay in her room. You did pay for it, but you invited her. Did you have stipulations for her accepting the family trip? Explain what you said here to her. She's being rude to the family by not doing family things with you, and it's hurting your feelings since the whole point of inviting her was for family bonding. Then try to work out a schedule that is reasonable. Like, \"at this time we will meet for this activity. I would appreciate you coming.\" But also be reasonable. She may not want to spend the whole day in your company. Invite this guy to join you for dinner. Just understand that she's at an age where she is getting out into the world, and the things you value may not be on the top of her priorities as an 18 year old.

Does anything about him seem off?\n\nI watch way to much Forensic Files but young women and girls do disappear from cruises all the time. Remind her of safety rules (do not leave the ship without telling one of her parents, watch your drinks at all times, etc). She is an adult headed to college soon and you won't be there to watch over her. Make sure that she knows all about protecting herself and trust her.", "YTA also thanks for giving me flashbacks of a vacation that I took with my mom when I was eighteen too. Hahaha she wasn\u2019t impressed either but honestly I was just acting like a teen on vacation. It was harmless in the end and she definitely overreacted. I don\u2019t think a cruise is a great way to make sure you have a captive audience with your kids. A more traditional vacation would have kept it more family focused.", "YTA, I get the purpose was to spend time as a family, but making it all about that and making her resentful of the trip is not going to have the intended impact you're looking for. You're looking for a memorable experience. Her memory of it is going to be her mom locking her in her room and forced to spend time with you. Let her roam and ask that she also make time for family. Forcing it will drive her away.", "YTA.  It's a vacation, she's having fun.  Locking her in the room is not going to help your relationship with her.", "I bet this is the last family vacation she goes on with you. YTA. She's 18 and it's branching out into the world.

If you don\u2019t, you will accomplish the exact opposite of what you wanted to with this trip: she will be mad at you before she leaves.", "She's 18 and an adult now. She should be able to socialize outside the family. Threatening to punish her and send her to her room is demeaning and goes against the very reason you want to punish her (wanting to spend time with the family). It really just sounds like you want to control you daughter.", "YTA. She\u2019s 18. Like it or not, she\u2019s an adult. Now you get to learn how to continue the parent/child relationship into an arena where you don\u2019t get all the control and final word. You may want to rethink your approach if you want her to talk to you after she moved away.", "I have a feeling that this cruise is the last time you'll have any \"family time\" with your adult daughter, as I can't imagine she'll want anything to do with you and your controlling behavior, as I'm sure this isn't the first time you've pulled something like this.

That sounds like an intelligent compromise, as opposed to parental dictatorship.", "Maybe you could have handled this a bit different than going all guns blazing. \n\nI\u2019m wondering, is this 18 year old guy travelling alone or also part of a family trip? He might be in exactly the same situation as your daughter, being forced to go on a family holiday instead of doing stuff he likes. Maybe he has found in your daughter someone in the same situation as him which is why they are enjoying each others company.\n\nInstead of taking your frustration out on your daughter why not sit down with her and ask about him. Where is he from, are his parents on the ship, can you meet them to see if they are ok with the whole situation, etc. \nSee if you can meet them and just introduce yourself. You might find that his mum has got the same worries about her son hanging out all day with a girl he met on the ship.", "So on your last family vacation before she goes off to college you're giving her a reason to not want to come back....good job.  Don't blame anyone but yourself when you see her less and less.", "You wanted a family vacation to have some close bonding time. So....

She really just needed to say how she felt and she wouldn\u2019t have came off as the AH", "Yup-I was onboard until he wanted her to stay in the cabin unless on excursions. That went way to far. \n\nThe OP needs to follow your advice. Talk to Sarah. Make a few deals like, Sarah will join the family for breakfast, dinner and excursions and she's free to hang out with cruise fling guy the rest of the time", "Her mom apparantly doesnt want to give her time for herself so how is she gonna do that?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

How is that \"reasonable leeway\"?", "I agree that she needs to respect the purpose of this trip to a certain extent and this could most likely be achieved through compormoise and communication.\n\nBut confining an 18 year old to the cabin (excluding family excursions) is waaaaay over the top and and AH move. That was too severe.", "Thanks!", "Let her have fun. She\u2019s 18, there\u2019s no containing it.", "Let her socialize with this guy and have set family events. I seriously doubt your family wants to be together the entire time. Family outings and meals are a reasonable set of times to do stuff together. But on travel days stuck on the boat people are going to break off in smaller groups or do their own thing.", "Yes mama. Suggest one meal a day as a family, plus excursions, and let her enjoy the rest of the time as the adult she is. She\u2019ll thank you and remember this trip as it was supposed to be: her last fam trip before college, and her mom being cool about her not being a child anymore. Also, please apologize to her. It\u2019ll mean the world to her and will make everything cool again and she\u2019ll actually enjoy family time with you versus resenting it. I\u2019m telling you this as the mom of a 19 year old. We can\u2019t control them anymore.", "Almost any idea is better than \u2018I want this to be a nice vacation, but also, stay in your cabin anytime you aren\u2019t with me\u2019.", "So you\u2019d rather she hang out alone in the cabin angry at you than spend time having fun with a guy her own age? Tell her you want to do either family lunches or dinners every day, and make plans for something at one of the stops. She\u2019s a teenager! Of course she wants to hang out with a cute guy!", "A better idea than locking her up because she * checks note * was having fun without you? I can think of hundreds. Stop being selfish and controlling.", "I have 4\n\n1. Stop trying to ground an adult\n\n2. Stop trying to ground an adult for the dastardly crime of interacting with people on a cruise\n\n3. Stop trying to pull the \"you're 18 but I'M STILL IN CHARGE!!!!\" flex. Which is all you're doing here and she hasn't even done anything remotely shady or irresponsible. \n\n4. Stop being a bad parent", "Enjoy the time you get with your adult daughter because if you act like this you'll only see less and less of her as she gets older?", ">You have a better idea?\n\nI do. Those things you're doing? Don't do them.", "How about some vulnerability and communication rather than I AM PARENT HEAR ME ROAR.  It\u2019s hey, you\u2019ll be moving soon and the plan was for some family togetherness on this cruise.  I would like to spend more time with you.  \n\nThere is a compromise between all or nothing.  Your daughter is her own person with her own wants, treat her accordingly.", "Difficult to a worse idea than what you pulled.  \n\nShe can either remember this vacation as one where she had a great time, enjoyed herself and carries fond memories. Or one where her asshole mother saw she was having a good time and basically kept her as a prisoner in her room, kept her away from her crush and basically bullied and controlled her. Ironically all done on a trip that was about her going off to college. Lady, if that\u2019s how you do presents/gifts, I hope I never end up on your Christmas list. \n\nBut you don\u2019t actually care about what she thinks or feels. So let\u2019s talk about the only thing that matters to you. Whether YOU have a good time. You\u2019re either going to have a good time. You can either spend it with your husband and other kids having one less child to look after and enjoy the cruise while being happy that your daughter is having a good time. Or you can spend it managing a sulky and resentful teen who is going to hate your guts. \n\nBy what measure is your plan anything other than just straight foolish. \n\nThe only way it makes any sense is if what matters to you is (1) showing your daughter who is boss\u2014aka bullying her or (2) you want her to be a babysitter for the younger kids. Can\u2019t help but suspect those are what this is really about and you don\u2019t give a flying shit about whether she\u2019s miserable or hates you, so long as you keep her in her place.", "Uhhh let her hang out with the guy?? When you\u2019re not even doing family stuff, why should she stay in the cabin instead of with him?? That\u2019s so controlling.", "i think everyone in the comments have better ideas than you did.", "Honestly I can't think of a worse idea.   \n\n\nHow about asking her to make sure she's there for the important (relatively) family events like excursions, meals, etc? Locking her in the tower until it's time to do family stuff is just the dumbest idea.", "Accept that she is an adult and can spend time how she pleases?

She can pick and choose who is part of that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe overbearing parent who is desperately trying to cling to control usually finds themselves off that list pretty quick.", "Set \u201cfamily time\u201d each day and otherwise stop treating your 18 year old like she\u2019s 8???", "Make it clear which family events she's required to be at, and make sure she has free time outside of those. Make expectations clear in advance so she can plan her time and communicate plans to her new friend.", "If you want her to spend more time with the family, then plan family centered activities that she will like to participate in. If y'all are just laying by the pool or playing bingo, then why does she need to be with you all the time. But if you are docking and doing something like an excursion, then she should participate. \n\nYou could also suggest that maybe she bring her new friend around so you all can hang out together or have him eat a meal with you.", "She's gonna do what she wants my friend, you can either keep this up and force her to hide these things from you. Eventually shell stop yalking to you all together. Or trust her and let her know, the moment she is uncomfortable you will help and ask no questions.", "Give her a little time slots..... bruh. Just tell her that you want her to be with family for a few hours in the morning, she can do what she wants for lunch and then back with family for dinner. At least then she can spend the after with him without you being HELLA CONTROLLING", "Let her be the adult woman she is and be her safe space? You know behave like a parent and not her prison guard?", "Yeah let her be her.", "Specify family activities and family time and let them hang out the rest of the time.", "This response blows me away. \n\nWhat could possibly be a better idea than doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons?", "That's your response? Really? I bet your husband has to ask permission to do anything.", "You stay in the cabin unless it is for a family activity on that everyone agreed. \n\nOh and YTA", "You get over this idea that it's a family trip and should go your way. What you want the trip to be matters to you and you alone, nobody else gives a shit and they are not obligated to spend their time making the trip what you want. \n\nYour allowed to be disappointed, your not allowed to force your will onto others. She's also an adult, you don't actually get a vote or say on what she does.", "Grow up and let your daughter who, checks is 18, hang out with who she wants to. You sound disturbed. And I feel bad for the children you have left, have fun with no contact from you 18 yr old 10-15 yes down the line. Clearly straight where you are heading\n\nIf you wanted family time you shouldn\u2019t have choose a cruise, it\u2019s a massive social party isolated on the ocean. She\u2019s going to socialize with other people", "Maybe suggest activities that you can do as a family? If she then refuses to do that stuff, that's when you can get on her about prioritizing this guy over family on a family vacation.", "A better idea? Hmmmm, let\u2019s see. Maybe not be a control freak? YTA", "this will get buried\n\nbut stop being ruth from titanic", "YTA. Give her specific things you want her to be there for i.e dinner/family going to the pool or doing a certain thing and then when there\u2019s free time instead of insisting she sit in a room doing nothing like a caged animal, let your young adult teenage daughter go and enjoy her free time and her vacation fling?? You absolutely are being overbearing and controlling with the suggestion of her staying in the room and wanting her to not see this boy at all, but you\u2019re not an AH for wanting her to spend more time with your family on a family trip. But you have to be lenient and let her do both.", "Yeah let her enjoy the time in her own way... You are being controlling and overbearing FFS.\n\nYTA OP. She's 18 and she found someone with whom she enjoys her time you should be happy for her", "This was a terrible idea for all of the reasons that people have already covered in exhaustive detail, but beyond that, I'd love to know how you plan to enforce this confinement. You're on a cruise ship (aka a floating collection of endless food and activities at all hours of the day and night, no car and mostly no money required), she's an adult, and I'm assuming she has a key card to the cabin. If she wants to, she can come and go as she pleases and you'll never even know unless you literally stay in the room with her the entire time. Failing that (if you take her card or the like), she can literally walk out the door and decide to see none of you again until the cruise is disembarking. \n\nGet a grip (on yourself, that is. Loosen up in regards to her). Plan some family activities and meals and let her have her fun around those.\n\nDo you plan to try to be this controlling when she's away at college? Good luck enforcing *that*, either, if you do.", "What a snarky response.  Just leave her the fuck alone and let her do her thing.  If she wants alone time or time with this guy, give it to her.  This isn\u2019t just *your* vacation, it\u2019s hers too.", "Uhhh\u2026. Noooooooot doing that?", "Or posts with people breeding who have no business breeding", "I missed that part in the original post. For that OP is TAH for sure", "Just a heads up they changed their mind.\n\nYTA - if you confine her to her cabin she will resent you for a long time, if you let her have fun with her friend then they'll eventually lose touch once the cruise ends.", "Damm, woman.  YTA.  And a controlling mom also.  Do you like it whem there is a sea of YTA?  Enjoy getting reamed so hard here.", "Well, you almost found someone who agreed with you!", "Typical, rejects all the YTA verdicts and clings to the only NTA (who ended up being a YTA anyway).", "And when the trip is over so is the relationship ffs. OP you\u2019re creating drama. Do you really expect an 18-yr-old to be so interested in family time?", "OP also claimed she was doing this to \u201cprotect\u201d her. Protect her from what? It\u2019s not protection. It\u2019s control.", "My mom tried to over control me into my teens. I moved out as fast as I possibly could, and it took me 4 years to start building a relationship with her again. OP, YTA.", "Of course she may find someone to keep her company in the cabin while the family is away. So there\u2019s that\u2026", "So tired of people posting and ignoring majority opinion and favoring the odd person. If you're not interested in what we are saying and are unwilling to reflect, don't bloody post it!"]}
