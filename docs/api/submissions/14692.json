{"id": 14692, "submission_id": "12km8ay", "title": "WIBTA if I asked this Ukrainian lady to stop bothering me?", "selftext": "I met a Ukrainian girl at the post office who was having trouble communicating with the staff. I have lived and worked 5 years in Moscow and am fluent in Russian, so I offered to help. I then gave her my phone number and told her to call anytime she needed help with the language. She asked if she could share the number with her mum and I agreed.\n\nWithin the week I got a phone call form her mum, \u201cElena\u201d. Elena had received a letter from social services saying that the financial aid she had applied for had been denied, she sounded very stressed out and anxious. I told her I'd try and find someone who can help. I got ahold of a lawyer friend who\u2019s worked with refugees before, I called Elena to arrange a meeting with him, but then she gleefully told me that the issue was over, she had just phoned her case worker and they had solved the issue immediately. I was upset that she hadn't bothered to let me know there was no need for me to spend the day making calls, but I said nothing.\n\nA couple days later while at work I got a text from her in all caps saying that her son was being suspended and they needed me to talk to the teacher. I explained that I was at work and asked if maybe she could you get the teacher on the phone and I'd be happy to translate, but she just replied PLEASE COME and nothing else. So I explained the issue to my boss, got in the bus and rode 20 minutes to the school, only to find Elena smiling at the school gate, who said that everything was resolved already but she just wanted to meet me in person. I explained that I had left work just for this and I'd have to make up for the missing hours later in the evening and that while I was happy to help, please don't tell me something is urgent when it actually isn't. She kept smiling and saying how thankful I should be that she'd given me an excuse to leave early.\n\nNow, this has kept on happening at least once a week for the last month and a half. Elena calls me and requires my help immediately, I then agree to help with whatever it is (write a letter, come over to social services, find her a piano teacher for her children) only to find that she doesn't need my help anymore, didn't bother to let me know, and doesn't feel she owes me any kind of apology. I've previously told her that if she wants to hang, she can just text me and we can arrange something over the weekend, but she never does that, she only calls with semi-imaginary, extremely urgent problems that I need to resolve NOW, when I try and offer to do it later or the following day, or to get her in touch with someone who's more fitted to help she just hangs the phone on me rather angrily (this has happened twice) which makes me feel quite guilty for not being readily available to help her. At this point I'm rather fed up with her and I'd just rather tell her not to call me anymore and block her number. But I feel bad because she's a refugee and probably gone through a lot, and this might be the way she manifests her trauma.
