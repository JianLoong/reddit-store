If something is child free and you don\u2019t like it, then don\u2019t go. It\u2019s that simple. She is being rude and needs to hear that it is rude", "NTA - If you had been talking about her, in a way that passive-aggressively calls her out, you would be TA, but in this case you weren't talking about her.  If she heard you and defensively assigned it to herself, that is a good indicator that she knows she's in the wrong.  Inconsiderate people don't generally like being made aware that they're inconsiderate.\n\nThe bottom line is the host makes the rules, and it doesn't matter if the rule is no smoking, no alcohol, no green shirts with blue stripes on the left sleeve and a tear on the collar, or no kids.  It's their party, their responsibility, and their problem when things go wrong, and so it is their choice.  Period.  \n\nInvitees and hopefuls have two options.  (a) Like it.  (b) Don't go.   The host really should have turned her away at the door, because he will now have to deal with her being emboldened by getting away with it this time, the next time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
