If she heard you and defensively assigned it to herself, that is a good indicator that she knows she's in the wrong.

It's their party, their responsibility, and their problem when things go wrong, and so it is their choice.  Period.  \n\nInvitees and hopefuls have two options.  (a) Like it.  (b) Don't go.
