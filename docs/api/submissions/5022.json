And, whoever\u2019s been using your products clearly doesn\u2019t want you to know about it, since they didn\u2019t ask permission before using YOUR things. It\u2019s not selfish or stingy to not want others to use your things withot telling you, regardless of how much they cost. If they want to use your products so badly, they should BUY THEIR OWN.", "NTA, she didn\u2019t even ask to use them before helping herself.", "NTA, its your products and you can tell your step mom that she can buy those if she wants to than spunging off yours if you bought them with your own money.", "NTA you spent a good amount of money on skincare that works for YOUR skin and the others were taking what was yours and you remedied that by removing your products from the bathroom.", "NTA. If someone else wants to use them, they can purchase their own. These are expensive, right? Your stepmother is an adult and should provide her own skincare products, not \"steal\" yours.", "Nope.\n\nKeep your products out of the bathroom. You spent your money on them.\n\nYour stepmother needs to quit being a shitty human being and to start buying her own shit for her skin instead of using yours. I would never put them back in the bathroom. They can get over it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and your stepmom made it super easy to find the culprit, huh? Dont put them back.", "NTA - your stepmom is a grown woman so she can buy her own if she wants it that badly. Maybe you should buy a little tote to take with you (like the ones used in shared dorms) and take it with you when you need them!", "NTA. DON'T PUT THEM BACK. It looks worse but you have a reason for it. KEEP those in your bag in your room. However what I would do is I would buy some cheapest things to my shelf in bathroom. Once a while I'd use them so ya know but they would be there mostly for the esthetic reason. \ud83d\ude09\nPS: I'd do just that and wouldn't make much more drama of it. Wouldn't confront stepfamily. Be above it. If they confront you, you're in right, so... They have nothing to confont you with actually.", "NTA - It's your stuff and no one asked permission. You're buying it yourself which isn't as easy for a 16yo as it is an adult. It sounds like you're having to special order these products as well, which can be an added hassle and something that needs to be made clear.", "Nope, your step mom seems old enough to purchase her own products. Even if she wants to use them that bad she could have asked your permission. Then complaining to your dad just screams immature.", "NTA. It doesn't make you look stingy and envious, it makes the thief look stingy (won't spend money to buy their own) and envious (wants your cool skin care products).", "WHAT? Stingy? Envious?\n\nTotally BS!!! Hide your stuff and tell them to buy their own products!!!\n\nFeel bad about what??? Using products YOU bought??? BS. BS. BS.", "NTA She can buy her own products and doesn't steal from a child. It is also so unhygienic to share skin care products since most touch the opening with there finger. And i don't want to talk about the little creme container in which everybody sticks there finger into.", "NTA - but use this opportunity to ask your dad monthly budget to get skincare products for the bathroom everybody can use.\n\nThey either appreciate it more knowing the costs or they won't ask again because it's obviously not theirs.", "NTA, the least they could have done is asked to share, and also chip in in buying them.", "NTA\n\nIt is not \"stingy\" to get upset that someone is using your stuff that you paid for, especially since they didn't ask permission or put it back properly afterwards.", "Whoever is using your products without asking is the stingy one! You are not an AH at all.", "NTA. \n\nIt makes your stepmom look stingy and envious of your products - she\u2019s the one using something that she didn\u2019t buy and now making a fuss so she can get them back. \n\nThe audacity of her to ask where YOUR products are. Buy some cheap stuff, leave it in the bathroom as \u2018yours\u2019 and keep your expensive stuff with you.", "NTA- And your dad doesn\u2019t need to give you a lecture on being cheap or stingy. If he wishes for his wife and step kid to have niche facial items to use, he is welcome to purchase those for them. If they have envy, then so be it. Your things are yours alone. Not communal. His family sound a bit entitled.", "NTA your stepmum is just pissed she can't steal your stuff any more. You need to hide them too or put a lock on your door. She clearly feels entitled af to your stuff.", "NTA\n\nYour stuff, your rules.", "NTA, IMO Parents should provide for their kids.\n16 year olds should not be required or judged to provide for their parents.\n\nBoundaries need to be established.  \nYour buying some specialized skin care products also does not give dad a reason to suddenly decide he no longer needs to provide for other items like soap, shampoos, toothbrushes etc.\n\nI\u2019m also old so take this sentence with that in mind.  TikTok has many scams and dangerous shills.  Be careful and do plenty of homework on purchasing from TikTok creators.", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her parents have fed her so they're entitled to take whatever they want without asking. \nI can't stand this mindset on parenting. \nYou bring a child into the world you are required to feed, house, clothe and give them a decent life. You are not then owed a damn thing for all the work you did because it was your job. You kid doesn't owe you shit for all the meals you made them because you were legally required to feed them.\n\nRaise the kid to be appreciative and decent. Say thank you when you hand them dinner. But you are not entitled to their stuff because you have given them stuff when they were a child.", "No! That's YOUR JOB as a parent to provide your child food, shelter, clothing and proper education. It's not something you can charge the child for. You made the child then you're completely responsible for their needs until they're an adult and able to provide for themselves.", "NTA \nIf stepmom/stepsister wants to use them, they should buy their own just like you did. \nAlso if its a bit of a hassle to go back and forth with your skincare-/bathroom products, get a little basket to carry them in one go. It stops the temptation of leaving your products back in the bathroom.", "NTA. I have a little basket that I keep my bathroom products in. It's a hold over from when I lived in a share house. Anything that I left in the bathroom was fair game, but if I didn't want or couldn't afford to share they went in the basket and back to my room. Now I just use it to keep them tidy and it makes them easy to put away if I have visitors.\n\nIf your dad wants your products to be communal then they can be purchased with the communal grocery money the same way soaps are. Provide him with a list of the products you have, the amounts they cost and how often you estimate they will need to be purchased at the rate they were being used. Explain that you have carefully chosen, sourced, and paid for these products for your own use and that you cannot afford to pay for other people to use them. And be prepared to hide any further purchases because there's a good chance your dad will try to compare his paying for your *essentials* with you paying for your step-mothers *beauty routine*.", "Looks like you now know who was using your product, and I don\u2019t think it was your stepmom.

None of us sees THEM paying for these items for themselves, only stealing from a child that bought them herself.\n\nYour father needs to tell the others that they should buy their own and stop stealing from you, otherwise he is not a good father. Instead of telling the others they are doing something bad and to stop, he is bullying you instead.", "NTA\n\nwhat you buy is yours. get a little plastic bathroom tote and put your personal stuff in it and carry it back and forth.\n\nIf your parents want communal stuff then they need to buy it.  Parents provide for kids, kids don't provide for parents.", "NTA, give your dad a list of what to buy if he doesn't want you to \"be stingy\". See if he still feels the same way.", "I'm sorry, but reacting to someone **stealing from you** makes you look \"*stingy and envious*?\"  Utterly ridiculous.

Those are insanely practical.", "NTA. You're not stingy and envious...your Stepmother is though.", "> For the past 16 years\n\nAnd they're on the hook for 2 more, minimum.
