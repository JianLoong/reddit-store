At first it was just for my face but recently I've finally found some products for the rest of my body that I've seen on tiktok but I couldn't find them where I live. So I bought them even tho they were a little bit expensive. \n\nThe things is that I put the products in the bathroom (so I didn't have to carry them everyday cuz I would totally forget) which I share with the rest of the people in the house (Dad, stepmom and stepsister). I didn't think anything of it until I started noticing that my products where not where I left them (I like to keep my shelf organize) or they wouldn't be properly closed. At first I thought I most have left them like that by mistake but then I definatly started noting less and less product , so I decided to just take them back to my room. \n\nWell my stepmom most have told my dad something because my dad pulled me aside and asked me why I took my things from the bathroom. I was honest and I told him someone was using my products and that I was pissed of because they've been taking more product than necessary. He told my that while he understands it makes me look stingy and envious. I feel bad now so I'm wondering if I should just put them back.\n\nSo AITA ?\n\nUPDATE: Turns out it wasn't my stepmom but my step-sister. After my dad told my stepmom what I said, my stepmom asked her daughter if she been using them and she said yes. My stepmom apologized to me and offered to give me money but I tolded her to use it to buy her daughter her own products so she doesn't have to use mine. \n\nMy stepsister also apologized to me and told me she didn't think I would mind. I told her I wouldn't have mind if she used some of it but she had been using wayyy to much(This is are kind of products that even a little bit created a lot of foam).\n\nJUST TO CLEAR A FEW THINGS UP\n\nMy stepmom is not a bad person or anything like that , I actually love her a lot. She just notices that my shelf was empty.\n\nMy dad didn't tell me to share and he did warn stepmom and stepsister to not touch my shelf (we all have a bathroom shelf for our things).\n\nAnything like this has never happend before like I've said we all get along pretty well.\n\nYes I payed for them.\n\nAlso \"Stingy\" and \"Envious\" were bad words to use. Like I said English is not my fist language and I just didn't know how to say the word that my dad said to me but basically he just said that it makes me look stuck up and seem like I didn't want them to even be near my products.\n\nI just made this post beacuse like I said this never has happend before and I feel bad for not sharing.", "created_utc": 1671355343, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zounhl/aita_for_taking_my_skin_care_products_out_of/", "score": 818, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ask dad to explain that.  \nAsk dad if he has any objection to your using his and other family members stuff now that you know he\u2019s ok with people using yours.  Try using his razor to shave your legs.  Try leaving someone else\u2019s toothbrush on the counter so it looks like somebody used it.  Use up the shampoo.  \n\nSeriously, get a little string bad and put all your stuff in that bag.  Then never leave it in the bath.  When it comes up. Just shrug and refuse to discuss it.", "NTA lmao!!!! \"Stingy and envious\" perfectly describes what your family is doing. Lol. Keep your stuff hidden, keep being glowy and dewy, and don't fall for that nonsense, little sister \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f", "NTA", "NTA unless she is going to chip in, it\u2019s not a communal item.", "No. NtA. If you paid a lot of money (or even any money) for your stuff, its your right to not want other people to use them up.", "NTA. It did not make you look stingy.", "NTA. Stepmom or stepsister. Dad can feel free to purchase for the other 2 women in the house. Tacky the stepmother would bring it up instead of purchasing herself. Not stingy you found something that works", "NTA. It takes a special kind of asshole to complain when they can't take your stuff anymore.", "NTA. Keep the bottles/containers and when they are empty fill them with cheap stuff and keep your stuff in your room when not in use. IF SM tells your you're out of product, tell her it's her turn to buy them and send her the link. IF she buys them, keep those too", "Envious of what exactly?!?! NTA - if your stepmom likes them she can buy them for herself!", "NTA\nIt's your products, not theirs, feel free to do whatever you want with them.", "If it makes her look stingy, it makes her step mom look like a thief.", "The person stealing your products is envious... not the other way around... NTA, but stepmother is...", "Just imagine maybe, perhaps, just by accident, you tell them to please not take your skin care, as you are experimenting with it.\n\nBuy a second of your product. Mix some habanero powder in your bathroom skincare.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nNo, honestly. It's theft when they're not asking first. Family should respect when someone is buying something for themselves, and sharing skin care products can result in contamination and then stuff like rashes, or pinkeye.\n\nNever share skin care!\n\nYou can offer to buy them some for Christmas, or their birthday, or something. Just tell them your stuff is hands off.\n\nYou're not petty doing that. You're resourceful.", "OP's parents are legally obligated to feed her, stop acting like they are doing her some huge favor that she is so lucky to have.", "\"the more you share the more you're going to get, usually\"\n\nbut often, if they are going to mooch off of OP and not get their own stuff, there is a REALLY small chance they would actually share with OP.", "\u2026 or even stingier!", "Dollar store decoys!!!", "I'm surprised AN ADULT would do this.", "Best idea \ud83d\ude0d", "NTA first of all it makes your stepmom look stingy for stealing from a teenager. Also I don\u2019t know why your dad thinks you look envious for setting boundaries and not letting your stepmom steal from you", "NTA buy some basic stuff and put them in the bathroom. They can keep using those. But hide the good stuff in your room", "NTA. You paid for it with your own money and it's expensive. No one even asked to use it. You're totally within your rights to keep it to yourself, your stepmom is just mad she can't keep stealing.", ">He told my that while he understands it makes me look stingy\n\nMeanwhile a grown adult stealing toiletries from a child is something no one should have any issues with?\n\nNTA", "No of course not. whoever is using your products is the asshole. Unless you are very well off and you can afford to buy gallons of the stuff, I certainly would keep them in my room. Not sure why your stepmother would complain? (Apart from the fact that she most likely is using your products). So NTA", "NTA. Ask in front of your dad and stepsister \u201chey, I\u2019m going to put in an order for X product. It\u2019s Y amount of money and shipping is Z, so a total of Y+Z. If you want them, please transfer the money so that I can put in the order.", "NTA! And how in the works does that make you look envious?!", "And now u know who was using ur products. Ur step mom. NTA", "If you look stingy, let dad buy the products.  Let's see who is stingy then?\n\nPut back the bottles but fill the bottles with cheap lotions.  Keep the actual products in the (now) cheap lotion bottles and keep those in your room.\n\nNTA", "Buy the expensive stuff and decant into empty nondescript bottles. Then fill the expensive containers with similar functioning but cheap products. :) Use your nice skincare in the nondescript containers in the privacy of your own room, and keep the \u201cfancy stuff\u201d in the bathroom.", "Um no. They just want to use your products. \n\nTell your father you're willing to leave them there if he buys the next batch, and you'll buy the batch after that, and so on. \n\nIf not, well just say you like your things organized. So you'll be keeping them stored in your room.", "NTA - we aren't talking about a bottle of Kirkland shampoo left in the shower here.... if the step mom wants some face creme, she can buy her own and not mooch off of a teenager.", "Nta - if you wanna keep the peace maybe refill the old containers with cheap products or any old stuff otherwise start using all their stuff without asking and then when they inevitably do the same complain to your dad that they\u2019re being \u201cstingy\u201d and you thought that if it was okay for them to use your stuff why wouldn\u2019t it be the same the other way around?", "NTA but here\u2019s the malicious compliance part:\n\nGet some empty bottles (could be travel bottles or whatever. Can find in lots of stores). Put all the product in the new bottles but leave a very small amount in the original bottles. Leave the new bottles in your room. Put the original now almost empty bottles back in the bathroom. When you run out, order and keep the replacements in your room. \n\nAlternatively, instead of putting nearly empty bottles back, fill them with random products that are inexpensive and easy to find while keeping yours hidden and preferably locked away in your room. Then the bottles seem full and you don\u2019t seem stingy. \n\nYour step mom and step sis are AHs for taking your stuff. Step mom is an AH for not buying replacements AND THEN complaining to your dad about it. And your dad is an AH for speaking to you like you\u2019ve done something wrong.", "NTA. That's expensive stuff, and you need it.", "NTA but show your dad the price and tell him he can buy some for your step mom or start paying for yours to share", "NTA. How can you possibly be envious of stuff you bought yourself? Tell them where to buy it so they can supply themselves (I\u2019ll bet they won\u2019t).", "NTA and no big villain! Gotta love a nice, tidy resolution - op gets to keep products in a convenient place, step mom was actually observant and caring, and step sister is reminded to be a better housemate and ask before taking, plus the parents provide more products. Hope dad gets op a basket for xmas", "And OP can easily say \"well I can't afford to be buying the expensive stuff if stepmom is gonna use more of it than I am so I switched back.\"", "I said envious beacuse it the literally translation of what my dad said to me \"Envidiosa\"  wich is a term for calling someone that doesn't share.", "Oh it's you again!  I'm still curious how many accounts you've had banned.", "Put the cheap product in the expensive containers once you have emptied them.", "Quite honestly, you keep using my stuff without asking and I put nair in the shampoo.", "Ah, I get it. You\u2019re still NTA and should continue to take your products out of the bathroom.", "There IS a stepsister as well. It is possible stepsister was using them, they disappeared, she cried to her mom who put pressure on her husband.\n\nWhich is still crappy but moderately less so than an adult woman stealing from a teenager. Moderately."]}
