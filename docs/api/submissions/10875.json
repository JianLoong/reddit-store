I finish up cooking with my aunt and everyone comes in to set up their plates. \n\nThe family friend came up to me and asked me if I made anything without gluten. I apologized and told her no, I didn't. She asked me if I could make her something and I told her it took me nearly the whole day to cook and that I just want to sit down and relax now. She got defensive and said that if I'm making dinner for all of these people that there should at least be someone else that's gluten free. I told her that there is no one that I know of in my family that has a gluten intolerance and if I knew if she was going to be here I would've made something for her.

Someone with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease knows all too well that allowing their food to be prepared in a contaminated kitchen by an unprepared cook is not worth the inevitable pain that will result.

Now it's true sometimes snafus happen and someone winds up so hangry they kind of lose their composure at being the only one who cannot eat. But when that happens, it's clearly the person who didn't communicate about their special needs or come prepared who needs to apologize. Hosts can't read minds, and can't magically wave away all the gluten contamination that on every surface, every appliance, and in most of your ingredients. Unless she got just diagnosed, she knew how to handle her needs and chose to go for the jugular unnecessarily.

Why didn't husband cook?   If someone talked to me the way entitled guest did, especially after cooking all day for a party, I would have offered her some fruit - not cut up, not fruit salad - like an apple, banana etc.  Very rude people.

This woman could've come up to you while you were still cooking or even when she got there, she waited until you were finished cooking to bring up her gluten issue.

Firstly, you had no idea you were going to have a gluten free guest.  Uncle should have asked you well in advance if you would be able to accommodate her.  Secondly, if you were willing to try to accommodate her, you would need more info \n.  I avoid gluten when possible bc I have gluten sensitivity, it triggers my migraines.  But I can tolerate some gluten, an occasional burger doesn\u2019t hurt me.  Some people are completely intolerant of gluten, they can get quite ill from trace amounts.  That would mean if you slice the bread and then the veggies with the same knife, they can\u2019t eat the veggies.  No way can you safely accommodate someone\u2019s food restrictions at the last minute.  They set you up to create drama, they owe you an apology.", "NTA.

Since it sounds like it was all on you. \n\nAlso, if she knew she was coming to an event with food, with people who don\u2019t know her and don\u2019t know about your food allergies then why did absolutely no one say anything?

I'm never coming back to your house, you complete stranger that I just harassed!\n\nFine by me!", "I wonder if the uncle told the friend he had let OP know about the gluten issue and either forgot to or never intended to. That would also explain why the friend was so pissed, and why the uncle left - he didn\u2019t want to get caught out.", "My aunt and cousin have celiac and they absolutely won\u2019t eat anything gluten free made in someone else\u2019s kitchen. There would be so much cross contamination they wouldn\u2019t risk it. My aunt is so sensitive to it she has her own department of silverware from my uncle. They both pack and bring their own food to events.\n\nI\u2019m betting this family friend may have a gluten intolerance but it\u2019s not severe if she\u2019s willing to risk mystery kitchen food.", "My mom has gotten me a couple times. I can handle cross contact normally but once she straight up cooked something with beer and didn't tell me.\n\n\nIf it's me cooking?

Imagine the entitlement?", "But it's wisest not to second-guess people.  Mine actually shows up in those health DNA tests but my doctor diagnosed it years ago.", "Or maybe people who are gluten intolerant?

If I know the host well enough, I check beforehand if I can bring a GF dish or if they would mind me discreetly bringing my own meal to heat up. I always carry a GF snack (like a protein bar), and eat something before I go. My family are always accommodating; they know I\u2019m severely gluten intolerant, and I don\u2019t have cross contamination issues. Funny thing is I\u2019ve learned to make extra batches of my GF desserts to my family gatherings - those often go faster than the regular!\n\nYour husband, the Uncle and guest are the AH here. Husband should have said that he won\u2019t invite the Uncle again until he apologized to you for such rude behavior. Next time, Hubs should call ever single guest and ask them for all of their allergies and preferences - Lactose? Shellfish? Vegetarian? Vegan? What about fresh cut flowers?Then **HE** can do whatever\u2019s necessary for accommodations. \n\nAnd JFC, who doesn\u2019t introduce themselves (or in this case, the Uncle)to the host? \n\nAgain, NTA.

Eosinophilic esophagitis? Seems to mimic celiacs...has trigger foods that cause flares. Usual trigger foods are the common allergens. Not an expert at all. Would assume an ENT or someone would have a better idea.", "I had a roommate with a gluten allergy, and she had all kinds of gluten free flours and blends. Some were okay, others were pretty bad (anything with pea protein felt sandy), others had hyper-specific applications (e.g. they might work for a cake, but they wouldn't work for a yeasted bread), and some had abysmal shelf lives once cooked.\n\nMy belief now is that wheat flour is a magic ingredient given its broad range of applications.", "\n\nI was thinking - scramble a couple of eggs, top with salsa - dinner in 2 minutes, but I am GF and have a host of recipes I have made before.

Uncle and husband should have cooked her something. Audacity of them all;(. Next time your husband can host it, or just order the food.", "NTA, but husband, uncle and friend are. Why doesn't the husband cook something for the friend, and he can put up with her yelling. On the bright side, I don't think you have to worry about cooking gluten-free in the future as I don't think they will be coming back.", "The audacity to come into a home of someone you don\u2019t know and demand the homeowners to cook you something different when there are tons of people to feed. \n\nIf they really had some food problem, they should\u2019ve brought their own food. \n\nHow wild to be this rude, entitled and self centered. Shame on the uncle and your husband. Their asses could go and make something if they feel so inclined to succumb to her demands. They have hands.", "NTA. Your husband can cook for the extra guest from his side of family. You prepared meal for everyone, you didn't know that your uncle will end up bringing a family friend. It was either his responsibility to provide food for her or her own and the audacity to yell at you for not being a psychic. Your husband is mad at you for not working more after you worked the entire day is the biggest ah here.", "NTA.", "NTA\u2014 she can walk to a store or restaurant to get herself something.

It was on the guest to mention ahead of time to mention her dietary issues or to be prepared and bring her own food. If your hubby or his uncle were concerned, they could have prepared her something to eat.

You had no idea that one with gluten intolerance was coming. If you had known you would however be the AH.

I get embarrassed just thinking about doing something like that. Your husband is an AH, your uncle is an AH and Miss Entitled gluten intolerant is an AH!", "Definitely not TA. Your husband, his uncle and the uncle\u2019s shitty girlfriend are the assholes. If you have allergies of any kind, it is YOUR responsibility to communicate that to the cook if they\u2019re serving you. \n\nAlso the husband for getting upset with you and blaming you for \u201cruining\u201d the night. If he wanted to save face so badly, he should have taken into consideration all that hard work you put in to cook for everyone and offered to buy her a gluten free meal, or made it himself. \n\nOhhh this one got my blood pressure rising lol", "NTA. Besides the uncle and his friend, your husband is a major AH!!  \n\nAre his hands broken?   If he was so concerned, HE should\u2019ve been the one to cook!!", "NTA.  We cook large family dinners.  I know exactly who can\u2019t eat what because I have been told over the years.  If someone showed up and demanded I make them something to eat because they have an issue I had not been informed of, I would have thrown them out of my house.  I\u2019d tell your husband you will no longer be hosting and if he wants to, he can do all the house cleaning, prep, cooking and clean up.  Your SO\u2019s behavior is disgusting.  I would say if he wants the invite and the uncle and woman there again, it will be over my dead body.  They owe you an apology before ever setting foot in your house.", "NTA You didn't know she was coming or that she needed something gluten free. She's never coming back here? Great, you're not running a restaurant, who cares?", "NTA I feel like we\u2019re missing something, but with the information presented your husband is so wrong for not having your back. Next time you should have him prepare for the large group and see how willing he\u2019d be to make a whole other dinner for someone on the fly. Without a warning, they are completely bonkers for thinking you\u2019ll be able to accommodate this.", "But also, who could have expected this person to come for dinner. She wasn\u2019t invited. Only the uncle knew. If anything the AHs are the uncle for not informing OP or the dietary restriction, her husband for siding with him, and the uninvited guest for their response to the menu.", "Or the uncle, or the woman herself. I know a few people with dietary restrictions and I can't imagine them having a problem with throwing something together in a family member's kitchen.", "Probably a good idea to put \u201cif we are not informed at least x days ahead of time\u201d. I can see people who bring uninvited guests \u201cinforming\u201d the host an hour before the dinner is to start and saying that they were informed ahead of time.", "Nothing to do with it. I come from a traditional culture and my husband would have been told to go cook. And he does cook when he has days off. (I am home all day, so cooking is usually my job. That was a monetary decision though, not related to gender roles.)", "Extra boo on the husband for telling his wife to basically get in the kitchen as if there was *nothing* he, as a man, could do about it himself. If it was so important to him he should have cooked her a meal! The audacity of him!", "Patients try this in the hospitals all the time. \"Give me my oxycodone three hours before its due or I am going to check out AMA!\" Um, ok, bye then. Have fun leaving the hospital on your stumps from your bilateral leg amputations.", "Same. I always mention it. Even with family, I'll ask what's going to be for dinner, because sometimes there will be stuff that they don't realize will set my allergies off. It's a subtle way to remind them, as well as check to see if I should bring something that should go with the food.", "Not sure but that\u2019s interesting. He seems to have it largely controlled with diet now, so I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s wanting to pay to see more specialists, but I\u2019ll certainly mention it to him. Thanks!", "Yep! I\u2019m in a similar situation. But I\u2019d never just expect someone to cater (literally) to me, and ESPECIALLY if they didn\u2019t know me or my dietary needs. \n\nAlthough it makes me feel special when someone does - \u201chello_haveagreatday, I got a small pack of GF buns for the cookout \u2018cause I knew you were coming, they\u2019re in the freezer.\u201d", "I get that with my food allergies. I am severely allergic to bananas and avocados. People assume I just don\u2019t like them, but I have anaphylaxis to them due to a cross reaction from a latex allergy. Same for my son who is severely allergic to a couple of legumes (peas, green beans - thankfully not peanuts yet which is also a legume). The school tried to make him eat green beans one day because \u201che should eat vegetables\u201d. Seriously\u2026he sees one of the leading pediatric allergists in the state due to the severity of the reaction last time he ate it, has an anaphylaxis plan on file at the school from this doctor, and epipens in multiple places in the school in case he accidentally is eats something with it in it and you still give it to him? I was NOT a happy person."]}
