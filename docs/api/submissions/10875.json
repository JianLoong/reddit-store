Someone with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease knows all too well that allowing their food to be prepared in a contaminated kitchen by an unprepared cook is not worth the inevitable pain that will result.

Now it's true sometimes snafus happen and someone winds up so hangry they kind of lose their composure at being the only one who cannot eat. But when that happens, it's clearly the person who didn't communicate about their special needs or come prepared who needs to apologize. Hosts can't read minds, and can't magically wave away all the gluten contamination that on every surface, every appliance, and in most of your ingredients. Unless she got just diagnosed, she knew how to handle her needs and chose to go for the jugular unnecessarily.

Guest could have brought a dish she could eat/share, uncle could have notified you ahead of time & OFFERED to bring a gluten-free dish, and hubby had alot of nerve to ask you to make something.  Why didn't husband cook?   If someone talked to me the way entitled guest did, especially after cooking all day for a party, I would have offered her some fruit - not cut up, not fruit salad - like an apple, banana etc.  Very rude people.  Maybe UNCLE can host the next party & your hubby can help.", "NTA\n\nMy mom and I both have a need to make sure we have food we can eat for different reasons, and we both make a conscious effort to either bring something for ourselves to eat at the event that we can eat, check with the host and check on the menu, or eat before we go. This woman could've come up to you while you were still cooking or even when she got there, she waited until you were finished cooking to bring up her gluten issue. She dropped the ball for herself here and from uncles reaction this isn't abnormal behavior for her. When you have a special diet, the only person who has to accommodate that or account for it is you", "NTA. Why couldn't your uncle cook something for his friend?", "Wth, of course you're NTA. Its superweird to me that they expect someone to cook for them when they just show up out of nowhere and expect something. You made dinner and as you said, if you'd been told about this before then you would have made something for her. They were rude and so is your husband", "NTA.  Firstly, you had no idea you were going to have a gluten free guest.  Uncle should have asked you well in advance if you would be able to accommodate her.  Secondly, if you were willing to try to accommodate her, you would need more info \n.  I avoid gluten when possible bc I have gluten sensitivity, it triggers my migraines.  But I can tolerate some gluten, an occasional burger doesn\u2019t hurt me.  Some people are completely intolerant of gluten, they can get quite ill from trace amounts.  That would mean if you slice the bread and then the veggies with the same knife, they can\u2019t eat the veggies.  No way can you safely accommodate someone\u2019s food restrictions at the last minute.  They set you up to create drama, they owe you an apology.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know her or her gluten intolerance. If someone has intolerances or allergies it\u2019s their responsibility to let whoever is cooking beforehand so they can prepare as needed.", "NTA. I would never expect anyone to accommodate my dietary needs if they didn't agree ahead of time. And if it was that important to your husband, he could have made her something.", "NTA. She was being entitled and rude. Also, your husband said you should just suck it up and make another meal, if it was so important, why didn't his ass get in the kitchen and make it? Guess it wasn't really that important to him, huh?", "NTA. As a person with celiac disease i always give people a heads up AND bring something i can eat just in case it\u2019s forgotten or if people have already planned the whole meal. It\u2019s on me to ensure I\u2019m not hungry", "Clearly nta, she needs to fuck off. You didn\u2019t know she was there and you didn\u2019t know she was gluten free. Also she said she is gluten free not intolerant\u2026maybe just attention seeking. You handled this right. She, the uncle and your husband were rude and wrong", "NTA \ud83d\ude2d you\u2019d never met this woman before and prior to her arrival no one you know had any gluten allergies. It was on your uncle to let you know ahead of time. Sorry she wasn\u2019t gonna eat, but again, you had no reason to think you would have to make an extra gluten free meal.", "NTA\nAn unknown and unexpected guest should make any needs nown asap. After the fact is bullshit, more on the uncles part than anyone else\n\nYou husband should be ashamed of himself", "So people you don\u2019t even know just show up for your large get-togethers, and then expect you to make them something special? I\u2019m sure there must have been meats/fish, salads or vegetables, or something they could eat. Instead, this stranger decided to go full drama queen on you. Someone you don\u2019t even know. Who shows up out of the blue. Not even a relative, but a friend of a relative.\n\nNTA.", "How is this in any way your fault?\n\nNTA", "NTA. So she was a surprise guest with food intolerance and no one thought to warn you? This is somehow your fault? I laughed when I read she threatened not to return! Okay, good? This isn't a restaurant, it's a family get-together. Your husband is the AH for not having your back on it.", "NTA. I\u2019m assuming your husband has hands and the ability to be an adult and make something himself, instead of blaming you? And uncle or his friend are capable of communicating needs in advance, not in an inappropriate way after everything is made? They all suck.", "Nta for this instance. But I think you and your husband are being pretty silly. I would never have a stranger in my home that I wasn't at least introduced to. And as for coming to a dinner party? No one I know would have the disrespect of inviting someone to my house without asking me if it's ok. Size had nothing to do with it. At our get togethers when I was younger we'd regularly have 24 people over and that's just family within a 20 min drive for a last minute arranged thing let alone a dinner party. Wtf is wrong with your family?", "and the husband getting mad at OP for not cooking more after cooking the entire day bc no one told her about a gluten intolerance?\n\nno way. if my husband pulled that, he would be cooking for the get togethers from that point on.\n\nNTA", "I agree but her husband is an A for getting angry and saying she just should have cooked something for her. Why didn\u2019t he offer to cook for her. Also the uncle is an A for not informing her before the party that he was bringing a guest with this condition.", "I agree. Also if the husband wanted her to have something gluten free he should have made it himself.\n\nNTA", "Before is better than after. Imagine waiting until everyone else is ready to eat before you tap the host to cook you a whole ass something else. So now you and the host can't eat for x time just so she can make you something. Dinner's already ruined at that point. \n\nAs someone with allergies and intolerances, if you're going anywhere for food; restaurants, gatherings, family dinners, it is on YOU to make sure that there's something there you can eat or that you've given the hosts a heads up. Or deal with waiting until later to eat. The frigging audacity, my man.", "I dunno if this person just has some minor intolerance or what celiac, but cooking for someone with celiac really requires a level of cleaning and vigilance you can't just easily do.  When I cook for my friend with celiac, I carefully clean my kitchen first.  In her house they have different sponges and brushes for gluten and non gluten dishes.", "Seriously, big family meals are awesome. When I was a kid, my uncle's grandma used to come over to his house & make dinner for his extended family. Total Italian-grandma, Have to Feed Everyone lady. If you were there, you were sitting your butt down & eating. \n\nWhich was awkward - I had allergies. Luckily my uncle helped her with cooking & would make sure I had food I could eat if I was visiting. Neither of us would *ever* have demanded she cook something special for me. When she did find out, she actually modified a couple family recipes for me (which my uncle told me later was A Big Deal). \n\nAll that said - what the f. My uncle cooked for me because I was his responsibility. Your husband is perfectly capable of doing the same for his unexpected guest.", "I\u2019d make the husband fully responsible for cooking for the next family occasion so that he can fully appreciate the amount of work involved. His reaction has amazingly outstripped the uncle and his guest\u2019s audacity.", "Or sit and blink rapidly while smiling, and say \u201cWhat, exactly, am I supposed to cook for this uninvited person?\u201d", "This!! How on Earth does \"just cook something\" isn't followed by \"why don't you?\"", "Yeah I find this entire post so confusing. People just randomly bring people to OP\u2019s house and it\u2019s fine? And she\u2019s just expected to be a mind reader by everyone around her? What is the whole protocol with these family gatherings? I am baffled. And I also come from a huge family that has pretty big get-togethers.", "Yeah, isn't gluten a pain to decontaminate. Gluten can stick around even with thorough washing, right?\n\nEven if op had gluten free food on hand, there might not be any sort of uncontaminated surface or utensil to prepare it", "If I were OP, husband would be cooking all the food by himself next time.", "I have a wheat & barley allergy, so a lot of my stuff ends up being specifically \u201cgluten free\u201d. As soon as I know I\u2019m going to a dinner at someone\u2019s house I\u2019ve never been to, I get all the meal information upfront. What is for dinner? Can I eat it? Do I need to bring any of my own food to accommodate myself & should we arrange to get there early to prepare it or should I do that at home first?", "Even most soy sauces like kikomans has wheat in it. In fact, based on the order of ingredients there\u2019s more wheat than soy.", "Yes, one would think that a person who has a genuine gluten intolerance or celiac disease would make sure, on their own, to either inquire ahead or bring their own food. \n\nThe nerve to expect otherwise, when a genuine problem with gluten requires no cross- contamination in the kitchen as well as the specific ingredients. It\u2019s not a bleeping restaurant.", "I wish the OP\u2019s in these situations when someone complains would tell them to do whatever they complying at OP about.", "or, I don't know, bring something you CAN eat?? I have friends that bring over their own oat bread or vegan burger patties and stuff all the time. They don't think their specific dietary requirements should create extra work for the host. Weird.", "Right? If my husband did that, I'd be handing him the spatula and an apron.", "[removed]", "And for saying *she* should have the mystery guest something to eat instead of making it himself.", "Exactly! I too have food intolerances, and I don't wait until the food is served to figure out if I'll be able to eat. Adults ask questions if it's unclear what is in a dish, and maybe eat a snack when we get home. \n\nThis random guest was childish and unreasonable. OP should be happy if they never come back.\n\nNTA", "That's what I said!", "I'm guessing uncle is some sort of patriarch in the family, whom everyone wants to keep happy.", "A true allergy would probably 100% have informed anybody who was cooking for them of their allergy, and more than likely would have some back up snacks with them just incase", "I have quite a few food allergies as well as a few intolerances. I keep my EpiPen handy. 99.9% of the time that I go to a gathering, I just bring my own food. Occasionally the host will reach out to try to accommodate, which is wonderful, but I know that my food restrictions are ridiculous, and I always thank them and just let them know that I'll bring what I want or eat what's already going to be available and safe. I see no reason someone should have to go out of their way for one person out of 20 or 30 or 40 or whatever the gathering is. I'm an adult. I can be responsible for my own food when it's an issue. NTA", "Exactly how I interpreted it too.", "Not all gluten issues are triggered by cross-contamination - some are so severe that the person can\u2019t eat food made in the same room as gluten foods, whereas some are only triggered if there\u2019s a certain threshold of gluten. It\u2019s up to the person with the issue to know their threshold.\n\nIt also depends on whether you\u2019re celiac, allergic, or intolerant or something similar such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity (it can be a trigger for a lot of chronic condition flare ups like Crohn\u2019s and migraine, where cross-contamination may be okay but if they ate straight up bread they\u2019d be really sick.)\n\nKind of like how there are people super allergic to dairy, where they could die from anaphylaxis if they eat it, but others are intolerant and would have a really bad bathroom day. Both are legitimate reasons for avoiding dairy, but they\u2019re at different levels of severity and require different levels of caution.", "Exactly. My dad has celiac and his strategy for social gatherings is either eat ahead of time, or cope. He hopes for there to be safe foods but he doesn't count on it (especially since not everyone understands the intricacies with cross contamination, sneaky sauces, etc)", "Sounds like your husband just volunteered to cook for the next get-together. NTA", "This! I am gluten-intolerant and when possible I'll try to find out what the menu is and if I can't eat anything I'll offer to bring an additional dish.  If I can't find out before hand or know it's going to be a gluten fest I'll eat something before I get to the event and bring a protein bar or something like that in my purse just in case.  I can't imagine throwing a fit like this gal", "Sounds like you have a fabulous set up and people can sit on couches, recliners, the floor. In a family the size of OPs you expect it when you get together.", "Communication goes both ways. It's just overly entitled of them to expect you to read minds!", "I don't think someone with celiac disease would demand someone cook for them on such short notice. Even if OP had obliged and cooked a meal with gluten-free ingredients, what about cross contamination? She'd probably have to deep-clean the entire kitchen to ensure it was truly safe for someone with celiac to eat.", "/u/Financifdgh is a scammer!  **Do not click any links they share or reply to**.
