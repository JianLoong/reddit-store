Someone with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease knows all too well that allowing their food to be prepared in a contaminated kitchen by an unprepared cook is not worth the inevitable pain that will result.

Now it's true sometimes snafus happen and someone winds up so hangry they kind of lose their composure at being the only one who cannot eat. But when that happens, it's clearly the person who didn't communicate about their special needs or come prepared who needs to apologize. Hosts can't read minds, and can't magically wave away all the gluten contamination that on every surface, every appliance, and in most of your ingredients. Unless she got just diagnosed, she knew how to handle her needs and chose to go for the jugular unnecessarily. You might have been kinder in your response, but it's fair that you were caught off guard with no idea how to accommodate her and were also justifiably hangry from cooking all day.\n\nNext time, if you want a neutral stance and don't mind spending some money on keeping peace, ask the person what their favorite gf/vegan/lf/whatever local restaurant is, and let them pick an entree from DoorDash. Of course, it's fair if you don't want to buy a delivery meal for someone who realistically should have brought their own. Just planting an option in mind in case you get cornered again in this kind of situation.", "Like seriously, board game nights are GF snacks only after we accidentally discovered us eating cheezits, while our friend ate candy, with everyone touching the same game pieces is enough to make her seriously ill. Cross contamination is not something to play with.", "Exactly. If you have food restrictions, you let the host know ahead of time to see if they can accommodate. If they can't, you ask if they'd mind if you bring your own food. If not, you eat beforehand. If you were invited last minute, you suck it up and eat what you can, which might be nothing at all. NTA.", "I\u2019m so confused at to why the husband is mad at her also-they\u2019re worried about the uncle patronizing their home like it\u2019s an underground restaurant?", "THIS EXACTLY!!!! THE FUCKING AUDACITY! Reading this just pissed me off so bad for OP. Everyone coming up to u telling u to cook for her should've done it then since it was such a miniscule task to them. And I'm sure there hd to have been some things she could have found to eat that were already made that didn't have gluten. The entitlement is sickening. Also have these ppl never heard that no one sits down to eat until the cook has sat down to eat? Unreal!", "Doesn't even sound like this person was invited by the actual host, just showed up with a random uncle. I can't even imagine this level of entitlement. It's appalling to me that some people just go through life like this.", "There are certain foods I can\u2019t eat. I always specify before hand. If I don\u2019t get an opportunity to, I suck it up, eat what I can eat. And just apologize to the host for not eating everything else. It\u2019s simple. There was no need for her to throw a tantrum. She wasn\u2019t an expected guest and couldn\u2019t have been catered for.", "And OP's husband sucks also for not taking her side in this, guests who bring guests can't complain.\n\nNTA", "This judgment doesn't track for me. This person was not actually invited, didn't give any notice that they'd be coming, didn't give any notice that they had a food intolerance, and were completely unreasonable in their demands. Then yelled at the host in her own home. Just because someone is a host doesn't mean they have to bend over backwards for guests that were not even invited. \n\nGuarantee you that people who are actually celiac pretty much always carry some gluten-free snack with them, because they've run into a situation many times where there wasn't food for them at a last-minute party or invitation. And someone who is actually celiac knows to plan for this. This person sounds like an absolute AH, probably doesn't have any sort of real \"intolerance\" whatsoever, and deserved no kindness from the host whatsoever.", ">Not wanting to try to accommodate a guest in you home, is a bit off for me though\n\nAre they a guest if you don't even know them and you didn't invite them, though? She's just an entitled party crasher.", "It was a stranger that she hadn't been informed was #1 going to be there and #2 had any dietary restrictions.   I would agree with Y T A if she was aware beforehand,  but no.... it was a friend of a relative that expected to be catered to after the meal was served.  OP is NTA for wanting to participate in the event she hosted rather than cooking for a random person that tagged along.", "Why didn\u2019t the uncle or his guest mention gluten intolerance when they first got there? Why wait until all the food is made?", "I would have ordered her something and split the bill maybe, or something like that.\nSalad or fruit too maybe.", "Trash taking itself out...", "I know there is gluten in some salad dressings and isn\u2019t cross contamination something to be concerned about here?", "It depends on the severity of the intolerance. And if things were cooked \"clean\" meaning no cross contamination. \n\nAlso depends on what's cooked. A big Italian dinner isn't going to have much that's gluten free except salad. \n\nMost chicken dishes are dredged in flour first. \n\nOp also says that the person could pick at what was safe for her to eat but she wasn't cooking more.", "In my experience, people with true food intolerances (allergies, celiac, etc.) are actually quite gracious and humble about them. If someone acts like an AH about it, it's almost guaranteed that the \"intolerance\" is 100% a choice they made along the way.", "There\u2019s gluten in all sorts of random food including seasoning blends and such. However if you have a gluten allergy that severe you come prepared!", "That\u2018s what I was thinking. There were no vegetables or protein components without wheat in them?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Shit, my dining room fits 8, kitchen 4, patio 4 if it's nice out. \n\nI'm perfectly capable of feeding that many, but when the guest list gets to 9, we do potluck. At 9, the volume gets unmanageable, and I have a 5 burner stove, two ovens, two fridges, a grill, and a smoker. Just wondering how the hell OP does it. I thought I was good, lol.", "Except the OP was a host in her home not a restaurant. Granted the OP could\u2019ve put together a salad quickly for her but I\u2019m sure the \u201cguest\u201d would\u2019ve had issue with that as well.", "If I am cooking for a celiac person I am very careful about cross contamination. If one appeared unexpectedly at my dinner I could not guarantee that I was careful enough to prevent cross contamination.", "Gluten is in soy sauce. It is in a lot of seasoning blends and gravy mixes. And if all the food was cooked in the same kitchen, cross-contamination is an issue. People who are sensitive to gluten can react at 20 parts per million, which is one noodle touching a green bean.\n\nI think the OP is most definitely NTA, and the visitor is the asshole for pitching a fit, but not for not trying to \"eat around\" something that could make her very ill."]}
