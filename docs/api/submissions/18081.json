One of the many symptoms is frequent injuries, especially dislocations and subluxations. I wear ankle braces whenever I plan to be on my feet for any period of time. I also dislocated my kneecap playing with a puppy on Saturday. \n\nI was at the \u201cpharmacy\u201d and after placing my order, sat down in the only available chair with my leg extended for my knee to get some relief. An \u201colder\u201d woman (40s or 50s) comes up to me and says that I am young and should let the older people there have the chair. I responded by pointing at my fully visible ankle brace since my knee brace was hidden by my pants and said something along the lines \u201cAre you an idiot that thinks I wear these as a fashion statement?\u201d. She called me a bitch and sulked away. The other people there gave me weird looks. Was I too harsh?\n\nETA: Was not expecting so many replies! I just want to clear a few things up since I can\u2019t answer everyone\u2019s comments. I don\u2019t think 45 is old! I was quoting her saying \u201colder\u201d. It was one of the reasons I reacted strongly. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve had an experience like this as well so I kinda snapped. I also understand that she could\u2019ve had an invisible disability but the only reason she gave for her demands (not a polite request) was that she was older than me. There was another occupied chair that had a man about her age in it and she didn\u2019t ask or demand he get up. I would\u2019ve absolutely given her the chair no problem if she gave me a reason better than mine to sit. I don\u2019t think being in your forties or fifties by itself is a better reason to need a chair than having bad ankles and a recently dislocated kneecap. \n\nAnyway, thank you to everyone who replied. I think I am just gonna come up with a snarky response to situations like this that doesn\u2019t result to name calling.

I have dealt with spinal cord damage due to transverse myelitis for 11 years now.   I barely leave my home now due to pain.  If I\u2019m in need of a chair, I will definitely sit down if one is available.  I also have patella subluxation mostly in my left knee and sometimes in my right knee. That is hereditary.  Once I was standing still in my kitchen, had a muscle spasm in my left leg due to my spinal cord damage.  It caused my left knee cap to come out of place with a hard jerk.  I got off balance and my right leg flew up in the air and I landed flat on my face on our kitchen floor.  It happened again in that exact same manner a few years after that.  I landed on our sunroom floor, crushed my glasses, and the bridge of my nose was flattened.  But back to the scenario described by the OP, I definitely would have stood up for myself if I had been reprimanded.  I would not have called anyone an idiot.", "i\u2019d ask the pharmacy if they have more chairs. seems kinda crummy to have to play who\u2019s got the most pain or see who can stand up the longest without bursting into tears. just a thought\u2026", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t matter at all if the woman wanting your seat was young or old. Not all disabilities are apparent. If someone is sitting down they may be sick, or injured, or perfectly fine. It\u2019s none of my business to demand the seat they got to first.", "Oh lord I\u2019m 50 and the thought of telling someone I need their chair horrifies me.", "Dude, I get it bc I have had an invisible disability for damn near half of my life. I just turned 34. To me you could have explained\u2026 instead of escalating. Not everything but simply\u2014 sorry I have a condition/disease/injury/whatever you feel comfortable disclosing. I say this as someone who since I was a teen has been discriminated bc I was always too young to have decimating joint/tissue issues. I know what your condition is\u2014 and yeah it does suck. Mine sucks too. I can\u2019t even remember all the times I\u2019ve had to politely explain why I need the chair/elevator/bathroom with handrails/ or why I just smile and bite my lip. I can\u2019t ever think of a single time when losing my temper would have improved the situation. \nWas she an ass, yes. But so were you. I have sympathy for you\u2014 it ended with you needlessly escalating the situation. Here very few will call you an asshole but you were. \nYeah it sucks being disabled in a way people can\u2019t always see\u2026 but being a jerk doesn\u2019t make you better. A life of pain sucks\u2014 and yeah in the last 3 weeks I\u2019ve had 5 joints pop out of socket and I\u2019ve had to ask help to undo my fucking Velcro straps. I\u2019m not saying all will be better but fuck me if I ever lash out like that. My issues aren\u2019t others\u2019 problems. It sucks but it\u2019s life and most days I can still enjoy. And sometimes being kind is better for your own health than anger. Anger will burn you from the inside out.", "NTA for not getting up but you could have worded it in a better way. I have to use a mobility scooter and it makes me so mad to see kids and college age kids on them and racing them or just joy riding. I\u2019ve complained and others have too. The store has a problem keeping them in good condition because of that and the company is slow to replace them. The store now has brought them inside by security and someone has to call inside or be dropped off to get one to use.", "NTA.  I've met someone recently who is 97 years young. She could dance circles around most of us. I talk to people on a daily bases who are in their 30s and 40s, and because of health issues or injuries, you would think they were in their 80s 90s. You can't tell by looking at someone what their health issues are. Arthritis has no age barrier.

That must\u2019ve been super offensive especially, if like me or others, we\u2019re not checking everyone out from top to bottom. She might\u2019ve missed it.

But yea next time just say I have a disorder injury I need this break.", "I'm 33 and regularly walk with a cane due to pain", "I'm in my 50s and fully capable of standing.  Yeah,  it's difficult,  and it hurts sometimes,  but doable.", "I actually had something similar happen to me, and I'm in my 50s. I was literally at a pharmacy recovering from open heart surgery because covid and a woman in her late 60s approached me in the same manner you're younger and healthier. Blah blah blah... and I just pulled my shirt back to reveal my still very icky and massively bruised up slice zone... \ud83d\ude43  F - THAT!

Moral of the story do what you need to cause if that happens again I will definitely be saying something, I was in total shock.

You could have empathized with her intent and her lack of understanding and responded with kindness instead of aggressive insult.", "NTA IMO the saying \"treat others the way you want to be treated\" is wrong, it should be \"treat others the same way they treat you\" because you shouldn't have to be nice to an AH when the start the conversation being mean, she lectured you and assumed because your young that you're fine and she is entitled to the seat, yes you shouldn't have called her an idiot but your condition was partially visible and she ignored it, she's not the first person to do it so after a while you want to skip being nice and go to mean so they go away, regardless of any condition, those seats aren't prioritised, it doesn't specify if someone needs it for fragility, pregnancy etc it was a first come first serve and all she had to do is politely ask not start demanding", "NTA if she want\u2019s that chair then she should be at LEAST be considered an actual senior also she needs to see you have a medical condition and your age doesn\u2019t reflect the severity of it, she needs to use her eyes that she has for a REASON!!!!
