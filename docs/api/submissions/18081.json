I'm a young disabled person and I can't stand people in public acting like I shouldn't be sitting down or using a cane or whatever. You gave her exactly what was coming to her and she deserved it.", "Not in the slightest - NTA - next time say \"but I don't get the full range of sensations from the butt plug unless I sit down\" and leave it at that.", "NTA. I also have hEDS and I had a gnarly patella dislocation a couple weeks back, probably my 20th dislocation on that side. People assume I'm fine because I'm 22 and look normal, but I'm in a constant 6/10 pain generally speaking lol.

But definitely harsh, someone in a rush and/or having a bad day might not have noticed. You could have just said no without insulting her.", "NTA but 2 things \n\n1. Not every situation in which you are wronged deserves escalation. You didn\u2019t have to call her an idiot. There were better ways to handle that. \n\n2. I\u2019m in my 40s and that isn\u2019t old.

She was too, but rudeness doesn't have to be met with rudeness.

It's wrong to assume someone doesn't need a seat like that because they are young, but to be honest, it's going to happen to you a lot.

Just the right amount of snark IMO.", "After that response, I wanna be your new friend.\n\nYou are a hero in these trying times of entitlement. \n\nNTA.", "ESH. You were both unnecessarily rude.", "NTA - She's TA for demanding you to get up off your seat. Who does that? You ask nicely first. I love what you said to her. Good for you.", "NTA - people need to learn to mind their own damn business", "NTA.  As an older woman, I am tired of other older women being nasty to young people.

Being young isn't the same as being healthy and does not mean you have to be standing up when you can sit, specially for someone that's healthy (and really entitled). You're NTA and shouldn't even think about the possibility of being TA.", "OP, As a 26 year old with crooked hips and arthritis in their legs, I have a similar story.\n\nI work at  a dispatch center doing IT. Long story short, older lady who walks with a hobble knocks on my door to complain her battery backup is beeping and needs reset, she cant bend over cause her arthritis.\n\nSo I am in her office shooting the shit with her while doing this, when I mention that I understand legs hurting, and started to explain my situation to which she immediately brushed it off, claimed I was in nicer words, full of shit because I am so young and shouldnt have to worry about stuff like that.\n\nI was like bruh..

I'll certainly give up my seat for someone is more disabled than I am, but not for someone healthier than me who simply happens to be older.\"\n\nI do realize this sort of ageist micro-aggression probably happens really often to you. I'm sure that sucks. But you still have a choice of whether or not to behave like an AH.", "NTA she\u2019s an ageist ah", "Nah, NTA. It might've been harsh but older people really need to gtfo of their high horse. A lot of them are hella entitled and want to be treated like they're some sort of high respected folks just for being old.", "Nta. I don't know why people can't just mind their own business.  I mean, if she saw someone really struggling and mistakenly asked you to move because she thought you were just being lazy, that is one thing. She'd still be wrong, but it would make more sense. That isn't the case though.  She just didn't want you sitting there. I see things that strike me as odd or rude on a regular basis, but if they aren't directly affecting me or someone else, I move along with my day.", "YTA, but only because of your response to her. From what you've written down, she asked a question. Even tho you were absolutely right about needing to sit to give your knee a relief. She could have had an even worse problem that made her wanting to sit down. So you showed no empathy or compassion, just like she didnt. I think you were too harsh, but life is about learning from our little mistakes.", "Calling her an idiot at the beginning of the conversation makes YTA.", "YTA for being rude right out of the gate, but NTA for refusing to get up.", "So you immediately called her an idiot even tho you also don't know whats going on with her. She could also have issues that are not visible to you and it's very possible that she didn't notice your ankles until you pointed at them. \n\nYes, YTA without a question", "As someone who lived with chronic pain for 6 years and could barely hobble to my errands for about half of that, I understand the frustration of people like that. But, I also think you jumped a little too quickly to calling them an idiot. I have explained to people that my back issues don't allow me to stand too long and I really need the seat and probably 95% of the time they understood and we went on with our day. YTA just for jumping the gun on the name calling and lashing out before even explaining it. I do understand that it's frustrating though, and wish you all the best :)", "Hahahahaha love it, NTA", "YTA, your \"idiot\" comment was not necessary. You should have politely declined, as any reasonable person would have done.", "You weren't wrong for sitting in the chair, or for not giving it up, but pointing to your ankle brace and saying \"I am injured and can't stand for long periods of time\" without the insult or sarcasm. So since you asked if you were too harsh, the answer is YTA.", "YTA. You could have used that as a moment to enlighten her as to your condition but NOOOOO you go scorched earth policy on her. She was right", "YTA\n\nYes, that was a bit too harsh as you went straight into a personal attack.", "NTA. And I think the idiot comment WAS necessary.
