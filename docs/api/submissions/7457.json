Last week my brother had to go out if town for the weekend which means I had both my niece and my daughter at the same time.\n\nI got a call from my friend telling me he is in the hospital. He doesn't have anyone in our town and needed my help with something. \n\nI called all my usual babysitters and my ex but no one was available and they don't allow babies in the hospital so I told my niece to keep an eye on my daughter, it was her nap time so all she had to do was just keep an eye on her and give her favorite doll to her in case she woke up and then call me and I'd be right back since the hospital is 5 minutes away. \n\nShe said no. I told her she doesn't have a choice, she is doing this. She said no I'm not. I said family helps each other, are you family or not? She said I'm not. I was so angry at this point. I left my daughter with our neighbor and went to the hospital. I don't know the neighbor well so I was worried the entire time.\n\nAfter I came back I told my niece since she is not family I don't see why I have to babysit her for free and since she doesn't have money she is going to do chores instead.\n\nI made her do the laundry, wash the dishes, vaccum the entire house and clean the toilets. I admit it might have been a lot because it was a busy week for me so the dishes and the laundry were for the entire week.\n\nWhen my brother got back and heard what happened he was furious. I told him, his daughter doesn't consider herself a part of the family so I treated her like she is not family.

In fact, it sounds like she is more responsible than you are.\n\nETA: It sounds like you're taking out your frustrations with this babysitting arrangement on your niece, which is unfair to her.

And you just keep on ignoring and dodging the question about what the \"life or death emergency\" was that your friend had", "YTA - you left an 11yo to watch a 2yo. What the hell. That's hugely irresponsible. She was right to not want to and you treated her terrible for it. Huge asshole.", "Wow, the kid is 11. Just 11. They said no because looking after a 2 year old by themself with no adult would have been a frickin terrifying responsibility. Yeah, some may have been up for it but this one said no. \nInstead of respecting that and being grateful for their honesty you went all Cinderella on her ass.\nA tough situation yes, and yes, you handled it badly and bullied a small child. A small child that most likely looks up to you as a mother figure if you are there so often that she has her own bedroom. Are you proud of yourself?\n\nEdited to add - if you couldn't outsource your parental responsibilities then you should have tried to outsource your friend favour responsibilities next rather than dropping the kids like a hot potato. \nYes it may have been 5 minutes (there & back & round the hospital in under that time, really?) but kids can cause life threatening problems in under that time.", "YTA. She wasn\u2019t comfortable being responsible for a baby\u2014that\u2019s reasonable!! Some kids are baby sitters by that age, but if she hasn\u2019t watched young kids before she was probably terrified. And you went full on Cinderella on her as punishment?!?! That\u2019s fucked up.", "YTA. A simple \u201cno\u201d to the friend in hospital as you had other responsibilities.  It only takes a minute for something to happen with an active 2yo, which an 11yo is definitely not up to coping with.  I can just imagine if something did happen, how you would blame your niece.", "YTA  - You made you niece clean your friggin house and toilets for not watching your kid as an 11 yr old? There's a special place in hell for people like you.", "YTA\n\n11 years shouldn\u2019t even be left home alone in several states in the US and across the UK. They certainly shouldn\u2019t be babysitting and responsible for another child younger than themselves.\n\n2 years are possibly the worst age to babysit, nap for far too little, hyper for far too long. They\u2019re too big for 11 years to just pick up when they\u2019re being naughty, but small enough to fit in gaps an 11 year old couldn\u2019t access. \n\nYou should never have been willing to leave your niece alone, never mind babysitting your 2 year old. And, you keep making points in the text and your comments that you were only 5 minutes away, but what about when you got the \u2018something\u2019 for your friend in the hospital, or if there was a car crash, or Road works, or anything. You could have been stuck away for much longer with a million and one circumstances, at which point, your niece would be stuck.\n\nAnd then, to really make yourself an AH, you decided to push, accuse your niece of not being family, then force her to do a significant amount of chores as punishment for advocating for herself.\n\nI appreciate that you felt desperate with a friend in the hospital, but to be blunt, there is no life and death need to help someone with \u2018something\u2019 whilst they\u2019re in the hospital. They\u2019re in the hospital, have healthcare workers surrounding them, and in the case of pets left at home, there are procedures in hospitals to get them care.

This is just wrong.\n\nI hope your ex never finds out that YOU TRIED TO LEAVE YOUR TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WITH AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD. Because if I were your ex, I'd be seizing full custody for sure.", "YTA. She's 11, a minor and you were trusted to care for her. Where I live, it's not even legal to leave a child under 12 at home alone, forget asking her to look after a toddler. And then you made her your maid! Are you freaking kidding me? That's abuse! You should never be allowed near children! \n\nIf your friend was in the hospital, I assume he was being cared for by the professionals there. Why not ask someone else to go do whatever he needed or take both kids with you? You made a bad choice and then punished an 11-year-old for it!", "YTA for two reasons. 1) you wanted to leave your small child with an 11 year old. Bad idea. 2) when she said no, you got petty and acted like a child. Your brother was right, you were an asshole.", "It wasn\u2019t a life or death situation- your friend was in hospital and asked for your help with something. You could have asked what it is, made arrangements to go later. You decided to leave your niece with your 2 yr old. You knew it was wrong as you did try and get a babysitter and when you couldn\u2019t get one you decided just to leave her with your young child. Then you treated her like a servant by getting her to scrub your house. You are pure nasty- if you have an issue with looking after her then take it out in your brother not an 11yr old", "YTA. I am stunned that you thought it was appropriate to leave a toddler with an 11 year old. Absolutely floored.", "YTA for several reasons.\n\nFirst, she\u2019s 11. You shouldn\u2019t be leaving a two year old in the care of an 11 year old. That\u2019s unsafe and irresponsible. \n\nSecond, she doesn\u2019t owe you child care by virtue of being in your care. This isn\u2019t quid pro quo. When you agree to look after a child (and 11 is still a child) you do just that and you should not expect babysitting in return.  If you don\u2019t want to watch your niece, take it up with your brother, don\u2019t take it out on her.\n\nLastly, punishing her with chores?  Really?  I mean if your goal is to just piss everyone off then mission accomplished I guess.", "YTA\n\nsounds like you care more about your friend in the hospital than your own child or niece.", "I have an 11 yo niece and I would not leave her in charge of a young child. Especially if she\u2019s uncomfortable with it which she clearly was", "I love when people post on here and then get mad when people don\u2019t tell them what they want to hear. Asshole", "YTA. You wanted to leave a 2 year.old.with an 11 year old? I'm assuming your niece is an only child so has no idea what to do with toddlers? That was a risky decision and your first AH move. As soon as she said no,you should have tried neighbours. That's far too much to put on an inexperienced child.\n\nTo then not only make her feel like she is no longer part of the family but to treat her like a servant is disgusting you should be ashamed of yourself and you owe her a huge apology", "YTA.\n\nYou try to get a preteen to watch a toddler, then get all pissy when she rightly tells you no, and get all huffy that you have to leave her with an adult neighbor.\n\nAnd on top of that, you teach the lesson that if she's not family, she's a maid. Yeah, that'll show her!\n\nWhat is WRONG with you?", "You tried to leave a 2 year old with an 11 year old?!??  What is wrong with you? That is the worst age combination, 2 years old are hard and they\u2019re mobile!  11 is too young for that.  \n\nThen you told her niece she wasn\u2019t family?!  Awful.  That little girl will never forget that.\n\nTHEN you treated her like your house elf instead of just telling her dad you can\u2019t watch her anymore?\n\nYTA x 1000", "11 year old watching a 2 year old without and experience handling a baby doesn\u2019t sound like a smart idea. YTA", "YTA. She's 11. She shouldn't be watching a 2 year old on her own. It doesn't matter that it was naptime, accidents can happen, someone could come and hurt them, she is not old enough to be responsible for a toddler. She was right to refuse, and then you tried to get her to do it by saying she had to. She responded like a child, because she is one! The way you treated her afterwards is terrible. Your brother is right to be angry. You treated his daughter like servant because you were mad at her. That's so messed up.\n\nAlso, a friend shouldn't take priority over your 2 year old child like wtf? You made commitments to watch your niece and your daughter, so a friend needing help, even if you want to help, isn't an excuse to leave them.", "Every part of your post shows that YTA", "YTA. In many states an 11 year old can not legally be allowed to be a babysitter. This was not her responsibility and she was letting you know that she didn\u2019t feel comfortable being put in charge of this situation. You put her to work cleaning your house because she felt incapable of caring for your child? You have anger issues and I really hope you get them in check before your own child is old enough to say no to you. Do better.", "YTA. Dude she is 11 why are you trying to leave a 2 year old with her? The hell is wrong with you", "YTA and you know it! What you did was irresponsible and stupid and nothing you say justifies your actions. Then you level up and treat your niece like shit because she didn't want to keep a eye on your daughter. Instead of trying to justify your piss or actions how about own your shit and realize theres reasons why children cant look after children.", "YTA. Reading your comments you\u2019re delusional too.", "She said she wasn't family because it was the only way to get out of it, because that was how you cornered her into looking after a two year old. I've seen your other comments, so I know you'll take no notice, but depending on where you are, you could be charged with child endangerment. An 11 year old cannot be responsible for a two year old. Regardless of whether they're asleep, regardless of whether you consider it taking her of her, at all times, someone needs to be in loca parentis. That's the legal term for having legal responsibility of the child. If you are not there, someone is in charge. And eleven year old cannot legally fulfil that role, legally, ethically or practically. \n\nInstinctively, your niece knew that. Somehow you didn't. Then punishing her excessively, as if anyone who stayed in your house woukd become your personal housemaid? Basically abuse at that point. It was petty, vindictive and just plain nasty. Obviously, YTA.", "Your friend ain\u2019t family yet you dropped your own family to help,then chastised and punished your niece\u2026this is hypocritical. \n\nYTA for leaving the kids - your own with someone you admit you were not completely familiar with and the other alone.\n\nWhat was so urgent that you left a young child alone and toddler with someone you don\u2019t know well for?", "Also now I see you don\u2019t have your daughter full time!!! That speaks volumes of who you are as a person!!! And you use your niece as a maid!! Wow..", "YTA your daughter is not the responsibility of a 11yo and when she doesn't want to you say family helps family as you ditch your daughter and niece to go do something for a friend sounds pretty stupid don't it. Then when she still refuses instead of being a adult about it you use her to get your house and laundry done as punishment.", "Sorry... YTA. She's 11. I totally understand you were busy, stressed and worried, but she's a literal kid... I felt for you until you said you made her do chores because she doesn't have money and she's not family... You went from generous aunt/ uncle who takes care of her niece, to a mean Disney step mother like person who makes you do chores...\n\nShe probably wasn't thinking what she said. She's a kid, they say things they don't mean too. But you, an adult, prove her right. Now she knows you think she's not family and chances are she won't forget it. You should apologize to both her and her dad who probably won't trust you to take care of her. Maybe buy her a toy and say sorry? Idk, you just need to apologize and try to make it right if you value your brother and niece.", "Ultimately YTA. 11yo should not be left responsible for a young child", "YTA.\n\nIf you couldn't find a babysitter for these two CHILDREN IN YOUR CARE then you, should politely let your friend know that he'll have to find another way to get his errand done.\n\nAlso, getting an 11 yr old girl IN YOUR CARE do all your chores and cleaning is just weird and petty.\n\nPS. If you are frustrated about looking after this child, take it up with your adult brother, not her.", "YTA. You should never be left in charge of children again, because something terrible could have happened to one or both of them in the 5 minutes you were gone. I hope your brother informs your child's other parent of what you've done.", "Yta, for a lot, but even as irresponsible it is to leave a 2 year old in an unwilling 11 year olds hands, leaving her with a neighbor *you don't know that well* is 100 times worse.", "YTA!! She will remember this and your relationship will not be the same.. you literally put a friend over the safety of your kid and niece.. she is a little girl.. the fact that your trying to justify this is worst!! You can tell you aren\u2019t good with kids..  to put your mentality to that of an 11 year old with that Bs of family help family!! Hope your family gets you.", "YTA", "YTA. Children of that age are not proper babysitters. They can\u2019t handle in case of an emergency. \n\nYou said your friend needed your help. You should have told him you can\u2019t make it since you don\u2019t have a babysitter and he needs to call another friend. Or take the children with you. Babies aren\u2019t allowed but your 2 year old is not a baby anymore. That is the life of parents. \n\nYou made your niece do a lot of choires. And you said it was maybe a bit too much because there was dishes and laundry from a whole week. Scrap the maybe. That is so much for an adult let alone a child. That is truely unfair since it is an unfair punishment to begin with. I don\u2019t mind children having choires. It is fine if they need to help a bit, but not as a punishment. \n\nAnd you telling her she should pay you? That is something you should take up with your brother and not a harmless child. You sound like a big bully.", "YTA\n\nDo you leave 11 years olds with toddlers a lot, or...?\n\nSeriously, you felt worse leaving the baby with a neighbour, presumably an adult, than a pre-teen who might not be suited in case of an emergency?", "YTA - this is feud worthy stuff right here.", "YTA. Your friend was in the hospital, where he had people to take care of him. What could he possibly have needed that would be worth wrecking your relationship with your niece and your brother? Your brother entrusted you with the care of his daughter, and instead you put her in a bad situation expecting her to suddenly babysit for a toddler. When she refuses because she's not comfortable doing that, you decide that you can make her your personal servant? nope.

Yeah, YTA. That's before we even get to all of the, \"Family help each other!\" and \"You're not family!\" bullshit.\n\nYou do realize that if something had gone wrong, whether it was the niece shaking the 2-year-old, the 2-year-old falling out of her crib, something totally unrelated like a fire, and it was found out that you had left two literal children alone that way, you could be in serious, serious trouble, right? If we were talking about a 16-year-old, my take on leaving her alone to care for the toddler might be different, but we're not. 11 is too young for that, and it was incredibly gross of you to try to browbeat and emotionally blackmail this kid who was (rightfully!) pushing back and then tell her she's no longer part of the family.\n\nIf you have beef with your brother about babysitting, then be a grown-up and talk to your brother. Don't take it out on a child (who had entirely sensible concerns about this whole, irresponsible arrangement) by bullying her.", "YTA for trying to leave an 11yo looking after a 2yo and an even bigger asshole for how you treated her when you got back from the hospital.

I\u2019m a doctor and I literally cannot think of one reason why your presence in the hospital would be a life or death situation such that you needed to leave an 11 year old to care for your toddler unless you happen to be the only general surgeon for 100 miles and your friend needed an emergent surgery and I have a feeling that wasn\u2019t the situation \ud83d\ude44", "Sincere question for everyone getting upset over leaving a napping toddler with an 11 year old:  how old do kids have to be to take a babysitter course where you live?

OP is TA but it's got nothing to do with preteens babysitting.\n\nI think the bigger issue is that the niece didn't want to and we don't know why. I wonder if she was afraid to be left alone, or if there was something that made her uncomfortable.\n\nOp, YTA for punishing your niece instead of talking to her. She hurt your feelings, and you lashed out rather than being an adult. You owe her an apology.\n\nEdited for clarity.

You, because an 11 yr old shouldn\u2019t be left alone to watch a 2 yr old no matter how long/short it is. Her, because she said she\u2019s not family - that attitude needs to be nipped pronto.

Shame on you.", "At 11 she should have been able to watch a mapping toddler but it sounds like she is an immature 11 year old so your niece is not ready to babysit just yet.

A toddler is mobile and curious, so many dangerous things could happen.  At 6 months, a baby sleeps in a crib, even if the child is upset it\u2019s super hard for a baby in a crib to hurt themselves.  Meanwhile a 2 year old can actually get out of a crib.  \n\nAt 3/4years old, kids can listen, take direction better and have a tiiiny bit of fear or sense.\n\nAnd 11 year old is too young to watch a toddler in opinion.

I have no issue with a minor looking after a toddler if they are a legal age to do so, know how to do it and agree to do it. My concerns are:\n\n1. She's 11 - too young to care for a toddler and she even told him she didn't want to. \n2. She is a minor in his care who the OP asked to do something she was not comfortable.

My 11 year old son, on the other hand, is forgetful, a bit rough, and easily distracted. Definitely not a good choice to watch a toddler. Same thing with my 12 year old niece. Every 11 year old has different capacities, so the \"hard AH\" judgements just based on age are missing what I think is more important: what made the niece say no? \n\nOP says her niece babysits other kids, so why the pushback on this? Kiddo has thoughts and feelings that are worth OP's consideration, but OP steamrollered over kiddo's objections like they were nothing. Which is very not cool.", "This. All it takes is the toddler trying to climb out of her crib and falling, of having a tantrum that the 11-year-old can't deal with and the 11-year-old shakes the baby, a situation where the 11-year-old tries to help (because she doesn't want to upset her uncle, who has told her that he's dealing with a \"life or death situation\" after browbeating her into caring for the toddler), things go wrong, and it ends badly. And then what? Uncle blames niece for fucking up, niece is traumatized, toddler is hurt or worse.", "It sounds like you're not very nice to your niece.
