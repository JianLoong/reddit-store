I want to preserve it for a future daughter or granddaughter and the dress would have to altered in order to fit my MIL.\n\nI'm also afraid of it possibly stained or torn since Rose is clumsy and has ruined expensive clothes of mine or her own because of it. The fabric is delicate and part of it is white, which is notoriously hard to get stains out of it.\n\nRose has been texting me about it, wanting to know my answer and I haven't told Marcus about her request yet.\n\nEdit: The reason my MIL asked me instead of renting/thrifting a dress is because she doesn't think clothing should be rented out and she'd feel uncomfortable wearing a stranger's dress when I asked her about it/offered those options.", "created_utc": 1698691381, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17k0ek2/wibta_for_refusing_to_let_my_mil_wear_my_wedding/", "score": 1831, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do mention it to hubby first because MIL is going to call her son once you say no, and he needs to be o. The same page as you.\n\nSorry MIL, but the answer is no.  Your wedding dress is a very personal thing for a woman.  You are just not comfortable with your dress being loaned out and altered a few months after your wedding.  \n\nThis is a test.  MIL is testing you to see if you will rollover for his request.  You need to be polite, but firm.  Sorry MIL, I appreciate you asking, but the answer is no.  (Do not get into the reasons why, once you do that, she will have a mitigation for each reason.  So keep it simple.  Sorry, but no.). You can point that customarily a dress for a vow renewal is a simpler version of a wedding dress as the renewal is not the same as a wedding.\n\nIf your husband questions why you don\u2019t want to loan it to his mother, tell him that the wedding dress for you has the same emotional connection as your engagement and wedding rings.  This is very personal to you as it is to any woman, and you really can\u2019t help but wonder why your MIL would want to wear her DILs wedding dress for her vow renewal.  She should get a new dress for her renewal and they actually make dresses for vow renewals, because a renewal is not a wedding.  The dress for a renewal is simpler than a wedding dress.\n\nIf you can\u2019t stand up to her now, politely but firmly, she will own you for everything else that she wants for the rest of your marriage.

Please hide your dress.", "NTA - this is a very strange request on her part. Firstly, that dress is YOURS, meant for your special occasion. Her wearing it cheapens the meaning behind it (and the fact that it would need to be altered also is extremely entitled on her part). Secondly, I understand not having a lot of money to spend on a dress but surely there are other ways to find something affordable and suitable (consignment shop, thrift store, online, etc.). Lastly, someone renewing their vows wouldn't typically wear a standard, white wedding dress as they already got to do that. I'm wondering if she was really inspired by your wedding or your wedding *dress*, because it sounds like this was her plan all along.\n\nTell her that you've thought about it but that you want to preserve the memory of the dress as *your* wedding dress so you won't be able to lend it to her. If she argues, hold your ground. Her options aren't your dress or nothing. She can figure something else out.", "NTA.

The fact is that you don\u2019t want to give it to her, and it\u2019s okay.  I have never seen anyone wearing a wedding dress for a cow renewal.  It\u2019s very uncommon.

That's kinda creepy and just weird.", "Nta. So she\u2019s not okay renting a dress that belongs to others but totally okay to wear yours? I would have just said no just because of the having to alter it. Personally I would tell your husband and let him know that as your present you want to give her money for a dress. Something cheap like $200-300. Then I would txt mil and say something like \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable lending my wedding dress to anyone just because it\u2019s something so personal to me. Everytime I look at it I think of my husband and how much we love each other, so it would just be weird to me to lend it to anyone.

Do they also hold re-elections every 4 years or something?", "NAH, but you are slightly venturing towards that territory by not just saying no and leading her to believe there is a possibility and also for not telling your husband, since this could cause some drama in his family. She is venturing towards being the AH if she pressures you too much.", "NAH. It seem like she asked you politely, and you have every right to refuse. Although I do think for the sake of getting along, it would be beneficial for you to explain to her the following:\n\n>I want to preserve it for a future daughter or granddaughter and the dress would have to altered in order to fit my MIL.\n\nI feel like like this is perfectly reasonable, given that it will also be her granddaughter/great granddaughter. Maybe leave out the worry she will stain it part though.", "NTA, it's your dress. You get to decide if you want anyone wearing it or not. Now, if you want a gentle let down, move the dress to your parent's house for temporary storage. You can now look all over your own house for the dress to no avail. Sorry, but you can't find the dress. You have looked all over your house for it. After the vow renewal, bring the dress back to your house. Ta Da, you found it!", "Oof. NTA if you say no, but I fear your MIL won\u2019t see it that way.

It's clear as day she will ruin it as well as things borrowed don't have to be treated with respect in her eyes..\n\nThat's the reason she doesn't want to borrow it from a bridal shop, she would have to pay for the damages,obviously she  doesn't have a problem in wearing others people's clothes if she wants to wear yours... It's because she doesn't want to care for it..\n\nAlso I would be really uncomfortable with the idea of my MIL in my own wedding dress (even if she treated it well)... that's just off-putting.

That's really weird thing to ask. I agree with what someone else replying said which that it's probably a test.\n\nBefore you decline, definitely tell your husband as she'll go to him after.\n\nMaybe you could say something like 'I'm sorry, you can't borrow mine, it's very personal to me. We could look online together for one you might like?' ASOS and Vinted both came to mind, but I'm sure there's loads of places.", "NTA. She is allowed to ask, and you have the right to say no.

Put a stop to it now before you begin to have your babies", "If she\u2019s in the US, she can go to FB marketplace and find lots of MOB/G dresses that will suit her just fine.", "NTA.  \nJust say that you're not comfortable with that. The longer you delay the less time she will have to find something else. Don't hand her that excuse to demand use of your gown.", "You don\u2019t have to loan your dress, but your daughter or granddaughter are not going to want it.  Be real.", "\u201cHey MIL. I\u2019ve given it a lot of thought and the answer is no. I have beautiful memories of our wedding day and the dress is special to me. I\u2019m flattered that you would feel comfortable wearing my dress but I wouldn\u2019t feel\ncomfortable seeing you in it. I hope you understand.\u201d", "I've been to several vow renewals, never has the wife worn an actual wedding dress. The dress she wore to your wedding would suffice. NTA", "NTA. Her request, is quite frankly, gross", "Omfg no. That's just creepy.", "Just tell her no because you want to wear it for your vow renewal so it doesn\u2019t make sense for it to be altered then say you\u2019d really love to go with her to look for a new dress! :)", "You're not the asshole.  \n\n\nBut I am. I'll be the asshole that you won't be.  \n\n\nIt's pretty obvious from the evidence you've described that this person doesn't have a lot of integrity and doesn't want to appreciate things. You've mentioned she has a history of not taking care of expensive clothing, that the dress would need to be altered, and that for some strange reason, she doesn't want to rent or thrift but doesn't seem to have any problems putting her grubby little hands all over your shit.  \n\n\nI'm with you in that I think a wedding dress should be a cherished heirloom for the next generation.  \n\n\nAnd me, the asshole that you aren't, thinks you should lie to her.  \n\n\nAs long as that dress is in your arm's reach, she'll never drop the subject. So lie to her and tell her it was given to a charity that gives secondhand wedding dresses to underprivileged brides. Tell her it's gone and you have no way of tracking it down, and then shove the dress in the safest, darkest corner of your mother's closet for safekeeping.  \n\n\nRemember, integrity is not something you do for other people, it's something you do for yourself. You can only have it for you, and people who don't have any integrity of their own will never appreciate yours. She won't hear the word 'No' until the dress is deleted from existence.  \n\n\nYou shouldn't lie to people... \"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind,\" but the person who says that is usually a lousy knife fighter that's already missing an eye. You never hear Olympic fencers with both of their eyeballs still in their skull say that stuff, because they're good at gouging eyes and not getting gouged back. Your MIL will gouge your eyeball over that dress and act like you're the bad guy because you want to keep it for future generations, so lie to her and tell her the dress is gone.", "I don\u2019t understand anyone in the entire world thinking they\u2019re entitled to wear another woman\u2019s wedding dress!! NTA!!", "NTA. Tell her you were wearing it the first time you and your husband had sex as a m arried couple. See if she still wants to wear it then.", "NTA. BUT, please don't go on that sentimental journey of saving for future generations. Personally, I'd let her. No one knows the future. Dry cleaners do a great job. And it adds to the value. If you harbour these dreams, you may inadvertently create drama over a dress. Future people have their own dreams. It would be special if they asked for your dress but it would be pushy as hell to suggest it. And ruin relationships.", "NTA.   \nIt\u2019s WEIRD for the MIL to wear her son\u2019s bride\u2019s dress to her own vow renewal. Is she trying to be you? It will look like that.   \n\n\nI know she thinks she\u2019s being reasonable, but she\u2019s being psychotically weird. Tell her you\u2019ll gift her a thrifted dress or a rental.   \n\n\nImagine the family photos\u2026 This is my son\u2019s wedding. This is my renewal.", "You spent all this money to wear the wedding dress one time and want to save it for a daughter ir grand daughter DECADES from now ?!  And quite possible daughter may not get married or want to wear an outdated decades old dress.   YTAH.  Make use of it.  What a waste of money.", "So she tells you that she feels uncomfortable wearing a stranger's dress but doesn't think you're going to feel uncomfortable letting her wear your freakin' wedding dress from 3 months ago? This woman has lost her marbles. No, of course you wouldn't be the AH.", "NTA. Tell your husband about the request and that you are going to tell her no. It\u2019s your dress, no one else gets a say quite frankly. MIL is maybe not really an A H for asking, but definitely a fuckin weirdo for wanting to wear the dress of her son\u2019s bride.", "Tell her to look on Amazon. I was watching a YouTube video earlier and someone found a nice looking one for $29 \n\nNta", "Hearing about MIL wanting to wear DIL\u2019s dress. The phrase \u201cMutton disguise as lamb.\u201d Comes to mind.", "NTA.  It is YOUR dress and NO is a full answer.", "NTA\u2026 what\u2019s your relationship like with your in laws? And what anniversary is she celebrating? Is it like a milestone anniversary or just something they decided to do?\n\nThe timing of their vow renewal is\u2026 questionable", "I find it creepy... Why would she want to wear the wedding dress that you wore to marry her son.  This should not be about the wedding ceremony but  rather a beautiful celebration of their marriage", "NTA. You have every right to say no. Explain politely your reasoning (not wanting to alter the dress, etc.) and hopefully, she understands that. Make sure your husband knows about the situation in case MIL tries to convince him to convince you.", "NTA \n\nNot only is your MIL's request a pretty bold challenge to your boundaries, your dress wouldn't even be appropriate for her event.\n\nAs the mother of at least one married adult, your MIL is solidly in matron territory, and a dress that screams \"new bride\" would be comical for a renewal ceremony.\n\nThis doesn't have to be the kiss of death for her, style-wise. There are tons of elegant , mature, fitted or shortened dresses and outfits for her select from. Nobody pretends she's a virgin at this point, so color and patterns come into consideration, too. And all are hundreds of dollars more affordable than a standard first-time bridal gown.\n\nBut your dress would not be the right style for her re-wedding. She should really know better!", "Good grief, your dress hasn't even had a chance to develop hanger marks, yet! She can find something on the clearance rack at David's Bridal.", "NTA", "Easy answer: No. you are under no obligation to loan it to her, even if she were impeccably careful. Go get it professionally stored by a reputable dry cleaner so if she needs more reasons than your NO, you can tell her it has been prepped and preserved for storage.", "Tell her it is cleaned, boxed and waiting for a future granddaughter.", "I mean NH, but I vote to just let her wear it. I don\u2019t understand why women think anyone really cares about their dress in the long run.", "NTA. \nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to save it for your daughter and it would no longer be special for your daughter if MIL had also worn it for a vow renewal.    \n\nWhy does she want to wear a traditional wedding dress for a vow renewal anyway?", "NTA, don't let her take it. It'll become her dress and you won't get it back and be able to preserve it, and it'll tarnish your memories of the dress. She can get another one. She doesn't have to rent a dress - she can find one from a thrift store or something that she can keep and have as her own afterwards.", "NTA- her request actually makes me uncomfortable. \nSpeak to hubby before replying and your reply needs to be a very firm no. You don\u2019t need to explain yourself to her the answer is I have thought about it and the answer is no.", "NTA. Your wedding dress is an intimate extension of your special day. No way would I let someone else wear, celebrate in, be photographed in and no doubt display photos of themselves in my wedding dress. There are a thousand ways this could go wrong and none that could go right. It\u2019s beyond disrespectful to even ask. Also, it\u2019s not her wedding day, it\u2019s a vow renewal - a full wedding dress seems a bit too much for that.", "Nta", "NTA this just has weird vibes. \n\nShe should be able to get a reasonably priced dress somewhere else. If she's okay wearing her daughter-in-law's dress, she really shouldn't have a problem wearing a thrifted dress as long as it's professionally cleaned.", "Tell her that if she wears your wedding dress then it will ruin the kinky wedding dress sex you and her son have been enjoying while wearing that dress \ud83d\ude02", "Since your wedding was so recent, tell her you sent your dress to be preserved and can\u2019t get it back right now. A lie, yes, but could keep the peace while also preventing her from pushing the issue.", "NTA.  Your MIL probably has wedding fever (i.e. went to a wedding, got excited and is looking for the same euphoria).  Can you gift (purchase) Rose a dress or get together with other relatives to gift a dress?  If not, how about something else special for her?  Help her shop for a bouquet?  Take her to a spa day?  Have her hair and nails done?  Give her a mini-shower with some nice upgraded gifts for her home (maybe a fuzzy robe, a wanted kitchen appliance, etc.)?  Even if she doesn't get your dress (and she shouldn't), that doesn't mean you can't give her something special.", "NTA it\u2019s your dress and even aside from the whole weird feeling the situation gives me she has a terrible track record taking care of other peoples things. Do not let anyone pressure you or guilt you into lending your dress! It\u2019s yours and you have final say.\n\nDo make sure your husband knows it\u2019s not happening, im hopeful he will wonder what on earth his mum is thinking and have your back 100%!\n\nDon\u2019t give her too much information coz any details are then open to be argued with. Just keep it short and simple like \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it a lot MIL, and that won\u2019t work for me.\u201d You could offer to help her find a special dress all of her own but from her not wanting to rent or thrift or spend money on one I would be hesitant to offer at this point. You\u2019d probably just be opening yourself up for more drama and I\u2019m sure \u201coh it\u2019s just not as nice as your dress, are you sure you haven\u2019t reconsidered?\u201d Type of nonsense", "NTA but go ahead and tell her now, so she can make other arrangements. If anything happened to the dress, it would cause a rift and you don't want to risk it. She's being silly about not using a rented dress. It seems she wants it because it is yours specifically. That's a lot to ask.", "NTA. I think she\u2019s trying to brag that she can fit in a 19-year-old\u2019s dress.", "NTA.  Be firm. You think all your other clothing getting ruined was an accident?  Come on. Shut mil down or you're gonna be miserable", "NTA what kind of parent of adults wants to wear a \"virginal maiden\" wedding dress anyway? Buy something nice that you can wear again MIL and add something like a hat.", "Nta it's not her dress", "This is so weird of her to request this. Definitely nip this in the bud now before she keeps seeing how far she can push your boundaries. Definitely fill your spouse in on things before you give the final no, so he can be prepared to have your back.\n\nNTA.", "Absolutely NAH.  This is behavior of someone who thinks that way.  What's mine is mine, and what's yours is hers.  Hold steady and no matter how much she nags, and your dress means more to you; the dress is a symbol of one of the best days in your life.  Continue to refuse her request, especially when she starts whining how that will take the shine from her renewal vows.  You are not in charge of making sure her life is wonderful and hope her day.is memorable, goes well and perfectly executed.  You might want to bring it to a bonded and insured storage facility so everything is protected.  I realize that my suggestion is somewhat harsh recommendation, it will, but you need to protect yourself.  Happy, happy wedding, and may all of life's blessings be given to you.", "NTA and the fact that it would have to be altered is reason enough to say No.  \n\nBut are wedding gowns worn at vows renewals?  That seems ridiculous. I\u2019m wondering if something else is going on, like is your MIL competitive with you?", "My answer would have been an automated, no . And I would send the dress to your parents so she can\u2019t get hold of it.", "I can't lend you my dress but I can lend you my underwear? Just as personal, but way less important.", "\u201cNo.\u201d \nAlso talk to hubbs so he\u2019s not in the unknown \n\nNTA", "100% no way.\nSeeing her have your dress will ruin your future plans that maybe your daughter may want to wear it. \n\nIts not just a dress its your wedding dress.\nPlus it actually seems weird", "NTA\u203c\ufe0f Talk to your husband and let him know that you really don\u2019t want to and clearly lay out your reasons.  He should be backing you 100%. \n\nAnd besides, everyone will know it\u2019s your dress, I\u2019m sure that most invitees would have attended your wedding!  Does she not realize that?  Or was she planning to alter it all-together?  Has she no shame?!\n\nPlus, I think it\u2019s weird that she wants to wear a wedding dress!  I\u2019ve gone to many and not one of the \u201cbrides\u201d wore a gown and definitely not white!  My friend wore the most beautifully bright colored dress because she thought the white of her wedding gown represented the canvas of her life\u2026.but after 30 years of marriage, she was living a full and vibrant life with the boy she loves!", "'No.'", "Honestly I never see people in bridal attire at vow renewals. Normally it\u2019s more relaxed or cocktail dresses", "I like you answer, but it is heading towards 'JADE' territory  (Justify; Argue; Defend; Explain). Just say 'no'. No is a complete sentence. \n\nNTA OP.", "In addition to the \u201csorry, but no\u201d you can add something like \u201cI hope you find a dress you love! I\u2019m sure you will look beautiful in whatever you choose.\u201d", "I absolutely love the \u2018dress is as special as my rings..\u2019 That is wonderful and relatable to most adults.", "So MIL doesn't want to rent and wear a dress that someone else has worn, but she wants OP to let someone else wear (and make changes) to hers? Hmm. OP is NTA. \"No\" is a perfectly apt response. If she feels charitable, she can say, \"Sorry, but no.\"", "I agree this is a test, a narcissist \u201cenlistment\u201d behavior. Not to mention it it also very icky. To try to insert herself into her son\u2019s bride\u2019s wedding dress. Yuck. NTA and I hope I\u2019m wrong but watch out for other behaviors, because this kinda looks and smells like personality disorder", "What do say to MIL if nicely worded.\n\nLove the wedding ring analogy. \n\nOP should definitely say \"no\" to loaning her wedding dress. That wedding gown is filled with her memories that should not be overshadowed by her MIL wearing it.", "It is odd.  MIL would do better to do a rent the runway or go to Nordstrom and purchase a beautiful dress of her own.", "Someone who has been married for decades shouldn't be bopping around in the same style of dress that OP wore, anyway.\n\nThe style guides are different for a renewal. Playing the ingenue is out.\n\nThe good news is that she can now choose from a wide array of killer looks that cost hundreds less than the sort of gowns worn by first-time brides. And maybe even get more than one wear out if it.", "Why can't she wear the dress that she wore as mother of the groom?? Why would she want to wear her daughter in-law's dress? It's just so inappropriate and gross and kinda creepy.", "She wouldn't even have to go so far as claiming it got jizzed on. OP could just point out that the wedding was so recent that the dress still smells like her sweat. \"If you don't mind smelling like me...\"", "Lying complicates the situation. Let your no be a no.", "Depending on how devious MIL is, make sure the establishment knows that only you are allowed to pick it up.

Nope.", "That might make her want it even more\u2026/s", "Hide it and make sure none of the family on both sides knows where it is. Including your husband. \n\n\"Huh it was here last week\"\n\nAlso be sure to tell your husband the no and the ick you feel about it. If he won't back you up, get a new husband. This is a major ick, and will set the premise of your marriage.", "MIL seems to be somewhat Bossy.  Hold true to your decision.  She will try every possible tactic to get the dress even though she knows you are not  willing to lend it to her under any circumstances.  Protect what is yours.  NOT THE AH.  \ud83e\udd9c", "That wedding was called off iirc?", "Ew! I didn\u2019t see that one! Seriously creepy.", "Exactly.  Oh I\u2019m sorry but I received a gift certificate to have it persevered but it expires this month!", "Mine is till hanging in the closet waiting to be cleaned. Wedding was in 2006!", "Yes, absolutely this. Get it out of your house. Who knows the length this woman will go to. I would seriously call the police or report as stolen if she took it.", "It\u2019s super creepy. Your wedding to my son inspired me and I want to wear the exact same dress.", "I'd say wear whatever you want. \n\nI'd love a reason to wear a fancy dress again", "I\u2019ve actually heard of women wearing their original wedding gown for a vow renewal. Most of the time, though, it\u2019s a nice dress or suit.", "Doesn't seem abnormal to me, a lot of people treat vow renewals as a sort of second wedding, or a way to have the kind of wedding they wished they'd had but didn't get.", "She liked DILs dress and she wants to wear it. This is her excuse to wear it. She has been wearing DILS clothes and ruined them. She's if truly awful!!", "My mom wore a wedding gown at her renewal. Her original wedding day was a backyard affair with a wedding dress, but it was rather basic. For the renewal she wore a full on gown(that was gifted to her cause the original owner decided not to wear it.)", "May as well chuck in the hidden camera footage as well then. In for a penny, in for a pound. No pun intended", "Because mother daughter relationship is more intimate than MIL-DIL relationship. That's why many women feel comfortable having their mother present during child birth as oppose to having their MIL.\n\nNo one find it creepy if the husband's father ask for his wedding tuxedo to wear at renewal.", "The relationship between a mother and her daughter is very different than a mother and her daughter inlaw. \n\nFor example, I have three small children who want to give me kisses on the lips. That is not inappropriate because of our parent/child relationship.

What hotel did you stay in for your honeymoon, and what was the room number, we want to get the same bed\" ew ew ew yuck yuck yuck!!!", "Tbh I actually don't know anybody who wore a family member's wedding dress unless it was a descendant. I tried on my mother's at 12 and it was already too short and small in the waist... and it had gone yellow... and I've never married. For a while I thought I'd use her veil somehow.\n\nIt is a very personal garment for a lot of women. I wouldn't share any garment I loved tbh.", "That is a really sweet story!", "My aunty wore the dress that she wore for my cousin's wedding, a really pretty and very appropriate MotB style dress, that looked gorgeous at the vow renewal, and was a very sweet nod to her daughter's wedding.", "I want to wear my original dress for my vow renewal, whatever makes you happy!", "lmao why did you roast the husband like this, he doesnt even know yet whats happening, she didnt tell him", "I guess I've just skipped the polite back and forths to try and establish factually-dubious details, because I can probably predict some of them anyway, given my experienced level in life.\n\nThere is no way in Hull that MIL has become confident enough to ask OP for her wedding dress 3 months after the ceremony, without having massively overstepped frequently before. I'm sure she began harmlessly at the neighbour's herbaceous border, but without anyone noticing, she has got close enough into the house to have one foot in her DIL's still warm wedding gown. I would bet my entire antique wooden self-pleasure collection that she had mentioned it to her son, and he grumbled some kind of disagreement, which she ignored and over-ruled. Husband needs help to see where boundaries need to be set, learn how to enforce them, and feel safe with them. It's not his fault, so saying emotionally-uneducated, that's not his fault; it's the teeny tiny apron strings he still has wrapped round him. She has manipulated him and he doesn't know any different. He is now married, and now he must learn. Absolutely no roasting towards him.\n\nI would also bet my album of Queen Vic's first edition nudes that mamma told HER husband about this, and he also didn't point out the massive incest vibes it gives off. For the people asking why it's creepy, a wedding dress is VERY symbolic. Gifting down to a daughter isn't weird because that is the day they became a family. Gifting up to MIL is weird because that's the day they........ well, became family.\n\n\"he doesnt even know yet whats happening,\"\n\nYes he does, he just needs to make some emotionally mature decisions, and follow through with those conversations. He should probably ask his mam where his balls and important documents are first though, in case he needs to beat a hasty retreat.\n\n\" she didnt tell him\"\n\nI suspect he knew before her, and still didn't give a head's up"]}
