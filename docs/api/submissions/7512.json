You're his partner, not his parent. And it's not like he even drank in front of you.\n\nYou also can't strong-arm him into not drinking for a month. That's a decision he needs to make on his own.

There's a very big difference between drinking to the point of hangover on a Saturday night, and drinking to the point where you're comatose. Your partner did the former, your sibling did the later. \n\nBy way of analogy, if your sibling got injured in a car wreck while driving fifty miles an hour over the speed limit on the highway, would you throw a tantrum because your partner drove the same 5\u201310 miles an hour over the limit that we all drive on the highway? Of course not. Same thing here. \n\nYou're mad at your sibling\u2014I get it. But you don't get to take it out on your partner. That means you don't get to prohibit him from imbibing *unless* you can point to facts that suggests he as a real problem. You have not done so. Overdoing it on one evening does not count. Refusing to participate in Dry January doesn't count. Unless your partner's drinking is actually interfering with his life (no, not interfering with his life with you, but interfering with his life), let it go.\n\n(And in case anyone is wondering, I don't drink at all.

There is a big difference in overindulging occasionally on a night out and alcoholism. You are free to not feel like being around alcohol right now, but your partner is also free to continue to live their life through this process of figuring out what will happen to your sibling.
