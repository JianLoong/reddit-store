I personally don\u2019t mind sharing if it\u2019s just a wee. But a #2 is a bit much, again, would have understood if it was urgent, and she\u2019d given you a warning so you could have chosen to leave. In saying that, super weird with there being a second toilet, completely unnecessary to have used the master while you were showering.", "NTA\n\nI've been very tolerant of this type of thing in the past and it tends to kill the romance.\n\nYou've asked her not to use the toilet while you're in the room and she's completely refused to respect your request. The fact that there's another toilet means that she's doing it deliberately as a power move, further evidenced by the \"I lived here first\" claim to rights.\n\nThis all says so much about her personality. I'd break up with her.", "NTA.  It's like she's marking her territory or something.", "I was on her side until she started shitting. That\u2019s too far", "NTA\n\nThis whole story would have been gross even if there'd be just one bathroom. Her accusations of you being immature are offensive. Worse even since she obviously never matured to the point where she learned to hold it back for some minutes (something most of us had to achieve in elementary school).\n\nBut pulling off one gross stunt after another while having a second bathroom with a toilet in it, is beyond weird. It is batshit crazy .... or in that case: girlfriendshit crazy.\n\nThat is not a matter of a lack of potty training. This girl has issues.\nYou can't tell me, this is her one single bad habbit.", "No, you're not the asshole. A lot of people in relationships would not be okay with their SO coming in to use the restroom while they are in there. Some couples are very chill and relaxed about it, but when it comes down to it, it's all about the comfort of the individuals.\n\nYou are not comfortable with it and you shouldn't be belittled because of that. She is in the wrong to repeatedly put you into uncomfortable situations and then berate you afterward about it. You should think of sitting down to have a serious discussion with her explaining that you don't want her to invade that space, it's uncomfortable for you, and she should respect that. If you come at her from a more serious discussion, she might come to understand that it is a boundary she needs to respect and she'll be okay with that. If she isn't, then that is a bad trait of hers. She should have more respect for her partner's boundaries.", "It's not a gender thing, your gf is being a dick.

She is more open and free about it, and you prefer privacy for bodily functions. Neither of you is wrong about it. \n\nBut she became the AH when you expressed your discomfort about using the toilet in front of each other and she disregarded your feelings and preferences. This is especially true because there is another toilet for her to use, so it's disrespectful to you.", "NTA \nYou guys need to talk about this and set the boundaries. \n\nYou both need to erase the fact that she was there first or it'll never be your home.  \n\nWhen my now wife, then GF, moved into my apartment first thing we did was replace a bunch of furniture, just some cheap ikea stuff, but we had to make it ours not mine. It was a good way for us to make that adjustment and I think it worked. \n\nJust like a couple of things. But it anchors the space for the newcomer", "NTA. Privacy is important. These things are a two-way street.", "NTA. What your SO is doing is just flat out strange and creepy. She is breaching your privacy. Nothing can excuse this behaviour, what is wrong with her? Her coming in the bathroom, _whilst you're taking a shower,_ and taking a dump in the toilet is just idiotic behaviour, especially since there's another bathroom in the area. I think you should have a deep conversation with her about your feelings about her issues, and if she keeps saying that you're immature then I really don't think your relationship will work out in the long run imo. The ironic thing is she's telling YOU that you're immature, when SHE'S the one who keeps invading your privacy. This is wrong on so many levels.", "NTA. Dude... I feel you. You need to really put your foot down on this. Not cool. If you want the immature side, eat a jar of pickles and a spicy salame pizza with extra cheese. Wait till she is in the shower. Unleash the equivalent of the minions of hell from your anus. You will probably end up single but it will feel like vindication. Or... Talk to her. Tell her how uncomfortanle.it makes you feel and you don't want it. She can wait or use the other toilet. It is a boundary issue.", "NTA. Sounds like you've set a clear and reasonable boundary and she is ignoring it. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 \n\nI understand there are emergencies but when you said there's another bathroom... Maybe set up shaving, teeth brushing etc for yourself in the other bathroom and see how she responds.", "NTA, you don\u2019t lose all expectation of privacy and space just because you moved in with someone, and it\u2019s not fair that she\u2019s using against you the fact she was there first.", "NTA!!! Totally gross. My husband and I will sometimes pee in front of each other. But we've been together 20 years and have never taken a dump while the other one was in the bathroom. \n\nI would maybe give her a pass if it was an emergency, but you have an extra bathroom!! She's being weird.", "NTA. I was on the fence about the peeing but the shitting after you asked for privacy in the bathroom PLUS there\u2019s a second toilet?? Wtf!\n\nMy bf (now hubby) and I spent many years in a place with one small bathroom. I\u2019d be in the tub and he\u2019d have to pee. That first pee of the day is quite\u2026 odorous and I\u2019d be basically at nose level. I\u2019d shut the shower curtain and get on with it. Eventually he figured out that it stunk less if he sat down. We tried to avoid poops when the other was using the bathroom, unless it was a big emergency. It\u2019s not immature, it\u2019s just having mutually agreed upon boundaries. \n\nI\u2019d reassert my position on this one, put a lock on the bathroom door, or move the hell out.", "There are some things that are sacred. After 27 years married I have never seen my wife go to the toilet and she has never seen me. Long may it continue.", "NTA. Some things really should just remain a mystery in relationships. \nToilet times are not to be shared. (Unless you're into that kinda thing\ud83d\ude2c) \n\nI would be, and have been in past relationships, cool with my bf using the loo while I'm in the shower, IF: \n\n1.) They're close to tears/in tears because they're desperate\n\n2.) I have a shower curtain or something so the view doesn't ruin my shower time. \n\n3.) It is only a wee. \n\nOtherwise absolutely not.", "NTA\n\nHowever....I am probably biased because I hate it too! But,  unlike your girlfriend,  my husband also wants his privacy while in the bathroom.  \n\nWe'll both announce to each other if we will be in the bathroom for a while (showering or whatever) to give the other person an opportunity to use it before. \n\nBut to add,  if there were an 'emergency', neither one of us would get upset if one had to go in and use the toilet.  \n\nI guess lock the door?", "NTA\n\nThat is disgusting. If it was a quick pee whatever. If she was doing her make up or brushing  teeth nit a big deal. But to take a poop when there is a perfectly good bathroom elsewhere? That's just gross. No one wants to smell your poop while they take a shower.\n\nI'd be pissed at that too unless it was the only available bathroom and they really couldnt hold it.", "My then boyfriend (now husband) and I moved in together in an apartment I was living in first- from that moment it became our place and not my place. He paid half the rent. He did half the housework - if not more esp during Covid when I was working and he was furloughed for a few months. Anything we wanted to upgrade so it was less of a girly apartment we chose together so it would be our place. He\u2019s a Us citizen but moved here from another country and didn\u2019t have furniture that was his so whatever he didn\u2019t love we discussed why, compromised if I disagreed, modified or changed. Within 3 months he proposed because living together was as easy as we thought it would be. \n\nAt this point and only living together a few weeks, it should be the honeymoon phase. We have since moved from our apartment into a house and it\u2019s been 5 years together. We never once use the bathroom when someone is in it unless it\u2019s just me doing some makeup and he wants to gel his hair because he\u2019s late to work. Like that\u2019s it. We have a second toilet downstairs if one of us really needs one even though it\u2019s in the basement of our house and it\u2019s cold down there. \n\n Tell her in a calm way you would like to know what you do that is bothersome and would like to share your feelings and make a list together. Go through them one by one and don\u2019t make it a you vs her thing - be solutions oriented with the mindset of you want things to work because you love each other and want to nip a few quirks you probably both have for long term benefits. If she wants to continue to be gross in the bathroom then you can leave and you\u2019ll be in a healthier headspace knowing you tried.", "I was watching my cats play.   They were chasing and wrestling and such, all through the house.  One cat jumped into a litter box.  The other sat down a few yards away and waited until the first cat was done and had left the vicinity of the box before they resumed their game. \n\nMy cats have more respect for bathroom boundaries than your girlfriend.

My boyfriend and I are very comfortable in front of each other in the bathroom, passing wind etc. He peed in front of me with the door open on our second date and at that point, I knew I loved that man. It weirdly makes me love him even more. The only way I can explain it is that comfort is important to me in a relationship and being able to go to the toilet in front of my significant other indicates comfort to me? My previous serious relationship was with someone who didn\u2019t even like to shower in front of me, which I found bizarre given we were intimate and living together. Meanwhile, I\u2019d happily pee with the door open so we could continue our conversation. Needless to say, these were symptoms of greater issues and it didn\u2019t last haha. \n\nWith that being said, my current partner and I don\u2019t generally go number 2 in front of each other. Firstly, I feel a little uncomfortable and embarrassed doing that in front of him. He\u2019d probably happily go in front of me, but I don\u2019t want to hear/smell his no 2s.\n\nWe only have one bathroom, and it\u2019s generally an unwritten rule that he\u2019ll wait until I\u2019m out of the room to go no 2s and he won\u2019t enter the bathroom if I say I\u2019m doing THAT. If one of us can\u2019t wait, the other person will vacate the bathroom to allow privacy.\n\nSo I find it pretty strange that she\u2019s not using the second toilet.

Thank god these men out themselves before she\u2019s left giving birth with zero support because \u201cit ruins the romance\u201d", "How is taking a normal shit and peeing \"at your most vulnerable\", LOL?", "Nope I saw it. That\u2019s why I said aside from the last indecent. Really not a big deal.", "Are you gonna post this same comment under everyone you don't agree with?", "Get over it. It lasts 3 minutes \ud83d\ude02 what\u2019re you gonna do if your partner gives birth and has herself ripped hole to hole? You gonna toss her out then too?", "Or will you not be in the room to help her out because it\u2019ll ruin the magic? Children, all of you. Thank god my partner has a brain on his shoulders", "According to OP, it\u2019s a sliding door so #1 is out.", "She got the last turd in.", "Heck, lock the door anyway.  She can still go without leaving the apartment.", "Even if there wasn't another toilet this is just disgusting. Unless it was an emergency shit she is just gross. Just because it's a natural bodily function does not make it remotely OK", "To me\u2026 if you have sex, you shower together, you can go to the bathroom in-front of each other. Being phobic about the bathroom is goofy. \nHer choosing to go in the bathroom youre already in instead of the other one IS weird though.", "I would agree to an extent if he didn't mention that there is another bathroom it truly is unnecessary at that point. Like an emergency is understandable but at this point the dude said he doesn't like it and there's away around she refuses to take just seems weird", "Ask that again when your stuck on the toilet without any toilet paper.....", "Well obviously to him it is a big deal, so why can\u2019t she go use the other washroom? Op is NTA, and is totally in the right to not want someone to constantly come to use the toilet while he is showering, brushing his teeth, or doing whatever else he is doing in the bathroom.\n\nUsing a public washroom is a poor comparison because when you use a public washroom, you don\u2019t really expect to be completely alone and not have anyone else using the washroom.\nIn your own residence, most people expect a certain level of privacy", "Just the ones that apparently don\u2019t know how to read :) \n\nAlso it\u2019s not the same comment, but a variation of the same comment. \nReading is fundamental!", "My partner has a dick. And the decency to ask if he can use the toilet when I\u2019m showering.", "Is that actually true", "Someone else asked op why not lock the door and they responded with \"it's a sliding door so that options out\"", "Dude sometimes you eat and get the runs even without IBS. You can't hold it once it starts coming down. But they have a second bathroom so there's no reason for her to resort to this unless it's a power trip.", "If one of us has to go when the other is in the bathroom, we just communicate our need. If I'm showering and he has to go, I'll rinse and dry quickly so that I can exit and he can enter.", "Sometimes you can\u2019t wait honestly. And it sounds like that was the case for her based on his description. But again, other bathroom!!", "I disagree with this, so you mean in your own opinion. Which is fine. I personally don't care if there's one bathroom.", "Some people can\u2019t wait a few minutes \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f ever. Your private shower isn\u2019t more important than their natural and emergent body functions", "When you gotta go, you gotta go. \n\nShit is a part of life. There may be a time when you have to take care of your significant other as you would a child. Or having an actual child. Or a pet. \n\nNow if there's ANOTHER bathroom 100% you use that and it's weird AF not to. When there's a single bathroom \n\nEvery shit is an emergency shit if you think about it \ud83e\udd37", "This is all normal couples but we are on reddit after all", "Nope. Poopy time is alone time.", "I have not and don\u2019t ever want to shower with another person, spouse or not. No thanks.", "Can does not mean should.  Only in emergencies.", "Sure you can, but why *would* you?  I've been married 31 years and we've never done that.", "No. People say it does but it always just smells like matches...and also shit.", "Lighting a match pretty much obliterates the smell of poop but does leave the smell of the match, which dissipates faster but also has a recognizable odor.", "I'd find a way to lock it if I valued my relationship.", "Yikes, go see a doctor. And i feel bad for your husband", "Sure sometimes you can\u2019t wait, can appreciate that, but that doesn\u2019t consistently happen\u2026", "I always figured too at some point it's entirely possible you'll have to care for your spouse to the level of wiping/cleaning due to injury/illness. People that are so squeamish they think it's weird to use the only bathroom at the same time just don't seem realistic to me about the fragile nature of life.", "Agreed! I'd get if it is a single bathroom place and it's an EMERGENCY, but most people can knock and ask to hurry too. I've done it with roommates. Like, \"Sorry, man, I've really gotta go, could you hurry!?!\"", "Ok asshole enthusiast. No one is trying to hang around and smell the other persons poop but if you have one bathroom and ive gotta shower or ill be late for work sorry \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Interesting", "I missed the part where OP mentioned that the half bath was on a different floor of her apartment or that his gf told him she sharted her pants before coming in the bathroom. You're clearly privy to information I am not.", "It can help but poop can still win that battle and then it just smells like poop and match", "Hahaha you feel bad for him from me making a logical hypothesis? Idk if that\u2019s hitting like you want it to, but we\u2019re all good b", "Emergencies are emergencies, hey let's be reasonable. But otherwise, yeah no.\n\nPoopy time is alone time.\n\nPeople should get this tattooed. I might get it turned into a wooden sign for my bathroom. That seems like a good idea.", "LOL no just not dumb and can connect the dots of her \u201chaving wet diarrhea\u201d and usually only peeing. I guess not all of us have the comprehension skills to piece information together", "you're connecting dots that aren't even there because you're inserting yourself in this reddit post. I can see you're very passionate about this.", "Again no, just not a moron. He said she usually pees, and had diarrhea the night she shit in there, so not passionate or connecting the dots that aren\u2019t there, just not being fkn moronic", "Plus b all of us are inserting ourselves, that\u2019s why he made a post on fkn reddit", "You are making assumptions and excuses for someone who is obviously inconsiderate. I'd connect some dots about what kind of person that makes you, but I don't like to assume."]}
