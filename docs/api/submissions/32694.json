I personally don\u2019t mind sharing if it\u2019s just a wee. But a #2 is a bit much, again, would have understood if it was urgent, and she\u2019d given you a warning so you could have chosen to leave. In saying that, super weird with there being a second toilet, completely unnecessary to have used the master while you were showering.", "NTA\n\nI've been very tolerant of this type of thing in the past and it tends to kill the romance.\n\nYou've asked her not to use the toilet while you're in the room and she's completely refused to respect your request. The fact that there's another toilet means that she's doing it deliberately as a power move, further evidenced by the \"I lived here first\" claim to rights.\n\nThis all says so much about her personality. I'd break up with her.", "NTA.  It's like she's marking her territory or something.", "I was on her side until she started shitting. That\u2019s too far", "NTA\n\nThis whole story would have been gross even if there'd be just one bathroom. Her accusations of you being immature are offensive. Worse even since she obviously never matured to the point where she learned to hold it back for some minutes (something most of us had to achieve in elementary school).\n\nBut pulling off one gross stunt after another while having a second bathroom with a toilet in it, is beyond weird. It is batshit crazy .... or in that case: girlfriendshit crazy.\n\nThat is not a matter of a lack of potty training. This girl has issues.\nYou can't tell me, this is her one single bad habbit.", "No, you're not the asshole. A lot of people in relationships would not be okay with their SO coming in to use the restroom while they are in there. Some couples are very chill and relaxed about it, but when it comes down to it, it's all about the comfort of the individuals.\n\nYou are not comfortable with it and you shouldn't be belittled because of that. She is in the wrong to repeatedly put you into uncomfortable situations and then berate you afterward about it. You should think of sitting down to have a serious discussion with her explaining that you don't want her to invade that space, it's uncomfortable for you, and she should respect that. If you come at her from a more serious discussion, she might come to understand that it is a boundary she needs to respect and she'll be okay with that. If she isn't, then that is a bad trait of hers. She should have more respect for her partner's boundaries.", "It's not a gender thing, your gf is being a dick.

She is more open and free about it, and you prefer privacy for bodily functions. Neither of you is wrong about it. \n\nBut she became the AH when you expressed your discomfort about using the toilet in front of each other and she disregarded your feelings and preferences. This is especially true because there is another toilet for her to use, so it's disrespectful to you.", "NTA \nYou guys need to talk about this and set the boundaries. \n\nYou both need to erase the fact that she was there first or it'll never be your home.  \n\nWhen my now wife, then GF, moved into my apartment first thing we did was replace a bunch of furniture, just some cheap ikea stuff, but we had to make it ours not mine. It was a good way for us to make that adjustment and I think it worked. \n\nJust like a couple of things. But it anchors the space for the newcomer", "NTA. Privacy is important. These things are a two-way street.", "NTA. What your SO is doing is just flat out strange and creepy. She is breaching your privacy. Nothing can excuse this behaviour, what is wrong with her? Her coming in the bathroom, _whilst you're taking a shower,_ and taking a dump in the toilet is just idiotic behaviour, especially since there's another bathroom in the area. I think you should have a deep conversation with her about your feelings about her issues, and if she keeps saying that you're immature then I really don't think your relationship will work out in the long run imo. The ironic thing is she's telling YOU that you're immature, when SHE'S the one who keeps invading your privacy. This is wrong on so many levels.", "NTA. Dude... I feel you. You need to really put your foot down on this. Not cool. If you want the immature side, eat a jar of pickles and a spicy salame pizza with extra cheese. Wait till she is in the shower. Unleash the equivalent of the minions of hell from your anus. You will probably end up single but it will feel like vindication. Or... Talk to her. Tell her how uncomfortanle.it makes you feel and you don't want it. She can wait or use the other toilet. It is a boundary issue.", "NTA. Sounds like you've set a clear and reasonable boundary and she is ignoring it. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 \n\nI understand there are emergencies but when you said there's another bathroom... Maybe set up shaving, teeth brushing etc for yourself in the other bathroom and see how she responds.", "NTA, you don\u2019t lose all expectation of privacy and space just because you moved in with someone, and it\u2019s not fair that she\u2019s using against you the fact she was there first.", "NTA!!! Totally gross. My husband and I will sometimes pee in front of each other. But we've been together 20 years and have never taken a dump while the other one was in the bathroom. \n\nI would maybe give her a pass if it was an emergency, but you have an extra bathroom!! She's being weird.", "NTA. I was on the fence about the peeing but the shitting after you asked for privacy in the bathroom PLUS there\u2019s a second toilet?? Wtf!\n\nMy bf (now hubby) and I spent many years in a place with one small bathroom. I\u2019d be in the tub and he\u2019d have to pee. That first pee of the day is quite\u2026 odorous and I\u2019d be basically at nose level. I\u2019d shut the shower curtain and get on with it. Eventually he figured out that it stunk less if he sat down. We tried to avoid poops when the other was using the bathroom, unless it was a big emergency. It\u2019s not immature, it\u2019s just having mutually agreed upon boundaries. \n\nI\u2019d reassert my position on this one, put a lock on the bathroom door, or move the hell out.", "There are some things that are sacred. After 27 years married I have never seen my wife go to the toilet and she has never seen me. Long may it continue.", "NTA. Some things really should just remain a mystery in relationships. \nToilet times are not to be shared. (Unless you're into that kinda thing\ud83d\ude2c) \n\nI would be, and have been in past relationships, cool with my bf using the loo while I'm in the shower, IF: \n\n1.) They're close to tears/in tears because they're desperate\n\n2.) I have a shower curtain or something so the view doesn't ruin my shower time. \n\n3.) It is only a wee. \n\nOtherwise absolutely not.", "NTA\n\nHowever....I am probably biased because I hate it too! But,  unlike your girlfriend,  my husband also wants his privacy while in the bathroom.  \n\nWe'll both announce to each other if we will be in the bathroom for a while (showering or whatever) to give the other person an opportunity to use it before. \n\nBut to add,  if there were an 'emergency', neither one of us would get upset if one had to go in and use the toilet.  \n\nI guess lock the door?", "NTA\n\nThat is disgusting. If it was a quick pee whatever. If she was doing her make up or brushing  teeth nit a big deal. But to take a poop when there is a perfectly good bathroom elsewhere? That's just gross. No one wants to smell your poop while they take a shower.\n\nI'd be pissed at that too unless it was the only available bathroom and they really couldnt hold it.", "My then boyfriend (now husband) and I moved in together in an apartment I was living in first- from that moment it became our place and not my place. He paid half the rent. He did half the housework - if not more esp during Covid when I was working and he was furloughed for a few months. Anything we wanted to upgrade so it was less of a girly apartment we chose together so it would be our place. He\u2019s a Us citizen but moved here from another country and didn\u2019t have furniture that was his so whatever he didn\u2019t love we discussed why, compromised if I disagreed, modified or changed. Within 3 months he proposed because living together was as easy as we thought it would be. \n\nAt this point and only living together a few weeks, it should be the honeymoon phase. We have since moved from our apartment into a house and it\u2019s been 5 years together. We never once use the bathroom when someone is in it unless it\u2019s just me doing some makeup and he wants to gel his hair because he\u2019s late to work. Like that\u2019s it. We have a second toilet downstairs if one of us really needs one even though it\u2019s in the basement of our house and it\u2019s cold down there. \n\n Tell her in a calm way you would like to know what you do that is bothersome and would like to share your feelings and make a list together. Go through them one by one and don\u2019t make it a you vs her thing - be solutions oriented with the mindset of you want things to work because you love each other and want to nip a few quirks you probably both have for long term benefits. If she wants to continue to be gross in the bathroom then you can leave and you\u2019ll be in a healthier headspace knowing you tried.", "I was watching my cats play.   They were chasing and wrestling and such, all through the house.  One cat jumped into a litter box.  The other sat down a few yards away and waited until the first cat was done and had left the vicinity of the box before they resumed their game. \n\nMy cats have more respect for bathroom boundaries than your girlfriend.
