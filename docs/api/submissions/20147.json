She's a bit older so I thought it was a mutually beneficial relationship (which she made it out to be) where I get saddle time and she gets someone riding the horse. Let's call her Jill.\n\n*Sidenote I am not financially well off. My mom is disabled and on benefits, my dad isn't in the picture, so this was all for free.\n\nFast forward to now Jill's friend came during me riding the horse and I was told when I got off that I'd be giving this lady a riding lesson. I gave her the lesson because I was a bit blindsided as this wasn't discussed. And like cool lesson goes off without a hitch. On the drive back, Jill was saying what the next lesson with her is gonna look like and how I need to do this that and the other thing. \n\n*Sidenote I apprenticed for 6 months under a very knowledgeable horse person last year and have been a riding instructor since.\n\nAnd I'm like uhhhh ok cool, but in future I do need to be paid please cause this is my livelihood and if I'm going to be giving lessons, it's gonna be my way which is a lot slower pace than Jill. I'm over here thinking like I'll charge literally just for my time as it's not my horse/facilities, etc, etc. So I said all this in a message to her.\n\nFast forward 2 days later she shows up at my work saying how I've hurt her and that after everything she's done for me I'm ungrateful and whatnot - in front of my whole family who are all in the car with me. Meanwhile most of the yard shows and horses I rode that she apparently paid for and that she quite almost begged me to do, were all things that SHE wanted to do. I'm not saying I wasn't keen on doing teh odd yard show, but it was never something I expressed and she's the one who offered. \n\nover the years in the event that I couldn't ride for a time Jill would get someone in the yard to ride the horse who as far as I know charges for her time. \n\nAnd she also said how this isn't my livelihood and I work for extra pocket money meanwhile what I'm earning I use to pay for gas, food and medical bills. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?", "created_utc": 1687260806, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14e8o8b/aita_for_asking_to_be_paid_for_horse_riding/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She now feels entitled for you to not only gratefully exercise her horse for free, but start free lessons as well? Hell, no, she just gave you an excellent reason to move on with a clear conscience.", "It\u2019s hard to give an accurate judgement without knowing all of the ways you may have benefited; however, I\u2019m going with NTA.  \n\nAt the very least; her communication style sucks, given how she blindsided you with the first lesson and then showing up at your work to put you on blast.  She\u2019s clearly a psycho. If she felt like you owed her, she should have been upfront about expectations.", "NTA.  Buuuuuut.\n\nAs an ex (retired) horse rider, I get it.  When I was of little means, I rode other people's horses for free. Because it is understood that horses are crazy expensive, (they basically stand around eating your dollar bills and wearing the equivalent of Louboutin shoes), it is also understood that riding for free is a privilege and a favour, no matter how good a rider you are. \n\nWhen I rode, I was giving my efforts to help train the horse - the owners quite often told me what they wanted improved (canter transitions, leg yields, etc etc), and I would work on that.\n\nSo it sounds like you are upholding this part of the \"unspoken\" agreement.\n\nBUT.\n\nWhen the owner did NOT have a prior discussion with you about the riding lesson, that crossed a boundary, and the lack of communication is the problem. Jill should have discussed dates, terms and conditions of any free riding lessons with you before doing this.  (I would also like to point out that in some riding stables, bringing in your own coach, or starting to give lessons, is a big no-no without the explicit permission of the manager(s) and any resident coaches on staff. So you should be double-cautious about that.)\n\nI think you will have to be careful in how you go forward from this point OP.  Jill clearly feels that you \"owe\" her for the free time spent riding her horse. And at the end of the day, she is the owner. The question moving forward is, do you want to keep riding her horse? If so, then I would apologize, acknowledge that she is being very kind in allowing free riding time and paying for show fees, and try to have a more balanced discussion of what you want to do about any lessons. This might be an opportunity to set up a more equal relationship moving forward.\n\nHope you post an update and let us know how it worked out OP.", "NTA. If you were giving Jill riding lessons, you should do it for free. But you have no obligation to do it for her friends.", "We used to have a horse that we boarded had riding lessons and exercise time, and \nEach of these things were charge separately. You should be able to charge for both exercise time in riding lessons since you are a riding instructor. You may consider offering private lessons and going to other Barn\u2019s to find ways to earn money. This is an expensive sport and if people are serious about eventing, they will pay good money to get proper training for winning. I want to tell you something you may not know about riding my daughter was getting picked on in school and bullied and she was wilting like a little flower. I decided one day for riding lessons to give her some self-esteem the day after her first lesson, she walked into school, and she didn\u2019t care what anyone said. It changed her life. She loved the sport. It was really expensive, but it was some thing I did for her because she was growing into a self-assured young woman. I eventually bought her the horse and she was taking lessons three times a week and she started competing. When she was 14 she was competing against adults and she was beating them. She became the East Coast champion and she has so many blue ribbons. I could fill a room with them. I\u2019ll never forget the meets and events. It was so exciting for her. I remember her getting off her horse when she was finished and running over to the scoring table and see what her score was. What you are doing can change someone\u2019s life you just don\u2019t know it yet. And you think that you should be unpaid?? if she keeps insisting that you give the lessons for free find another barn. Hello.", "NTA. Jill sounds unreasonable and unhinged.", "NTA Seems to me, asking for payment in ridinglessons for things after the facts isn't done.  Jill seems like to not respect you. She shows up at your work, to discuss a private matter. She also tells you, as a riding instructor, how to teach her other friend.\n\nAsking for a compensation for allowing them to ride your horse seems to me that it differs from country to country. In my country it's common to pay for that. However it also depends on the riding skills of the person, how well trained the horse is and if the person is suppossed to train the horse in a specific way. \n\nFor example I never asked money for it. My first co-rider because she was young and I had rather had her spend time with the horse instead of having her to work more to pay for it. The second co-rider because she is much more experienced then me and I expected her to train my horse.", "ESH. Only because, sounds like you have been benefiting from her freebies for a long time now. She's AH for making assumptions, you're AH for accepting freebies but wanting to be paid for what you can give.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But even if she had been incredibly generous and paid your way out of the kindness of her heart, that does not mean that she now gets to decide that there are strings attached. \n\nIf she meant this to be a quid pro quo (beyond the inherent part where you get to ride the horse, the horse gets exercised/shown) then she needed to make that clear.

Normally you pay to rent time on a horse. She could find 100 teenage girls eager to ride in exchange for chores around the stable. I did this with someone's elderly horse. He walked, and occasionally cantered or trotted, but that was fine. Riding is riding. \n\nThere is no benefit to Jill to have someone ride her horse.
