Our current rent is about $2,000/m and various utilities run about $700/m. I make about 4x my SO so I pay all of the rent while they pay the utilities. We also shopped for our furniture together and paid equal amounts. We didn\u2019t go all out and stayed within reasonable budget. For example our couch cost $500 and my SO easily paid $250 and I paid $250. We\u2019re happy with the situation and there\u2019s been no complaints.\n\nI\u2019ve been offered a new job in a new state and we agreed to move for my job since it\u2019ll be a great stepping stone for my career and I\u2019ll be making much more (about 6x more than my SO). Also, my SO works at a job that is easily available in the new state. Furthermore, my SO is excited to move because the new state has much more opportunities and things for us to do for fun. \n\nThe problem is that my SO have been looking at places that cost between $8-10k/m while I\u2019m only comfortable with paying up to $4k/m. My SO argues that I have to look the part of my new position and the more expensive places are in better parts of the city with less crime. While that is a valid argument, my contention is that we don\u2019t have to live in the city and I\u2019m willing to commute. In addition, my SO have been looking at furniture and appliances that\u2019s far beyond what we currently have (we\u2019re not bringing anything but clothes and some items). For example, I\u2019m perfectly happy with a $500 couch but they\u2019re looking at one that cost $3k. We went back and forth until I had enough and said that I\u2019m only paying $4k/m and we\u2019re buying reasonable furniture and other household stuff. If they want to live in a luxury building or have designer stuff, they\u2019ll have to pay the difference.\n\nMy SO was hurt by this and accused me of being financially abusive and rubbing my better earnings in in their face. They\u2019ve gone to their friends and family and literally everyone is against me.

Now you SO is going further, spending more of your income without your input, because you\u2019d kinda already granted that permission. NO ONE else decides how you spend your money other than you. On top of this, involving other friends/family members makes this even worse (think abusive here). Unfortunately, I only see one solution. Leave the SO behind and transition to a LD relationship until SO chooses to grow up. \n\nPeople living together (comment limited to in the US-I only know the laws here) should always be splitting bills 50/50 and singly purchasing items, with all decisions based on the LOWER salary. You two didn\u2019t do either. You\u2019re splitting purchases (wrong) and not equally responsible for bills (also wrong). This is the only way to prevent one member of the relationship from taking advantage of the other until a lawful union of any kind occurs. After a lawful union, split the expenses any way you want-there will be legal backing for it. Doing anything else is fiscally irresponsible and disadvantages both people-ask any financial advisor (or even any self-made millionaire). Your story is proof too. Had you two initially split expenses evenly, you wouldn\u2019t be needing to argue about this now and neither of you would be feeling like the victim here (you have ground to feel this way; SO absolutely doesn\u2019t). \n\nEdited to add: 50/50 doesn\u2019t work after a lawful union.  There are dozens of acceptable ways to handle finances after that.", "You said she like NTA from this post, but I feel like you must have worded it more harshly than you\u2019re letting on.

Compromise means adopting other peoples perspective, whilst holding them accountable to do the same. If this relationship matters a good deal to you, come to terms with your collective income being shared, rather than holding on to the idea that your earnings, and your partner\u2019s earnings, are separate matters.

Losing patience with someone over shared furniture, or other household goods, is not a big deal. Failing to fully communicate why you\u2019re worried about over spending, whilst managing a big change in your lives, is more of a concern.

But if you want a place that\u2019s more than $4k, you need to be willing to pay the difference, because I am not willing to spend any more than 4K. If the place you want is $5k or $10k/month, I don\u2019t really care, you need to pick a place where you\u2019re comfortable with paying that difference.

However, SO demanding you spend all your money therefore preventing you from having savings *could* be a form of financial abuse in some circumstances\u2026 absolutely NTA", "NTA. Honestly my problem with this is that she definitely didn\u2019t plan to contribute but was already planning on spending more. It\u2019s very concerning that she\u2019s saying that this is abusive behavior.

It seems SO wants a luxurious lifestyle they can\u2019t afford, so they see your increase in income as a way to fund it. I wouldn\u2019t agree to that either.", "NTA. Take your new job ....AND GO ALONE.", "They see you as a golden goose now and still manage to play victim when boundaries are set. Run!", "Tell me your SO is a gold digger, without telling me your SO is a gold digger. \ud83d\ude44\n\nNTA, your SO is taking advantage of your generosity. Just because you're now gonna be making more money, doesn't mean you need to live above your means. If you are responsible for the main expenses of rent and furniture then you need to decide what you are comfortable with spending monthly. Not them.", "NTA.

Posters normally put themselves in the best light. We don\u2019t know to what extent their SO does the housework, etc. Usually men do less household even if both partners work full time. If OP is a man, does less housework but is withholding things that would make his partner\u2019s life more enjoyable and compensate for her making his life easier, it could be a form of financial abuse.\n\nI would love to hear from the partner. Everyone is jumping to the idea that the partner is a gold digger instead of probably (given they are moving with OP) a life long partner who could have contributed behind the scenes (like MANY women do) to their partner\u2019s success and are tired of sitting on IKEA couches and living in walk up apartments with homeless on the doorstep and want a little more space in a HCOL area. For example", "Right! Like split the bills in half and OP drops their bill by 650 while SO\u2019s bill rises by 650. There is nothing wrong with splitting bills 50/50, if your SO doesn\u2019t want that then they\u2019re not worth the effort.", "\"Look the part\" to whom??", "This happened to me OP. Don't do it, stand your ground. Before you know it your SO will spend your money to buy you gifts and then be angry when you never wanted it...not to mention you paid for it. It only gets worse. He's my ex husband.", "I mean, no offense to anyone but isn\u2019t that potentially a clue the OP is stingy and not just cautious? An ikea couch is more. Maybe the partner is just tired of living like a college student and has been supportive behind the scenes and feels that it\u2019s time to enjoy just a bit more comfort?", "If you don't mind using 2nd hand items. Look on fb marketplace. Or join local buy nothing groups. My SO & I managed to furnish our 4 bedroom home without paying a penny on furnishing. We only spend on bills and what necessities for our family of 7.", "That's what I learned as well. My couch is over 10 years old and still looks almost new. But it was a floor model bought on the tax-free weekend so it was more than 50% off.", "If it ain't broke, DONT fix it. OP keep the $500 couch and when it dies, buy another one", "That's going to *entirely* depend on where you are. $4k in Kansas is absurd, but $4k in Greenwich Village is going to be pushing it into lower-end rentals. Considering OP's salary and the rent estimates, it's very likely they're moving to a high COL area.", "Partner seems to not be thinking ahead. By spending less p/m on rent, they could be putting aside money for a house later on. OP, Leave, run, skedaddle out of there. Your SO doesn't seem to care about anything but your money.", "How do you know they didn\u2019t? Men with partners tend to be more successful - even when the woman works - because the woman usually handles all the daily things that take time to allow them to focus on their work.\n\nI suspect OP knows this and that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t let us know the gender", "[Bot](https://old.reddit.com/user/Then_Lab8377) stole [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13npx4p/aita_for_wanting_my_so_to_pay_more_for_rent_and/jl0quyw/)  \nand reworded slightly", "you can find pretty decent lightly used sectionals for under $500 at thrift shops like the Habitat for Humanity Restore.

Um...rethink the SO altogether.", "Reminds me of a fucked up X I dated. Get the fuck out bro.", "Nta. They seam very excited to spend your money even before you earned it.

Make sure you clarify with all of the people who are trying to say that you are being financially abusive, point out that your partner is the one who wants the fancy apartment, not you.  Your partner wants the fancy furniture, not you.\n\nShift the blame/focus back to your partner being greedy and trying to take advantage of your financial windfall.

Stick to your guns on this one. Maybe it\u2019s time to have a big financial discussion with your partner because it seems like the two of you are on different levels.", "This was my first thought. I live in a very high cost of living city, and $10k is \u201cf- you money\u201d type of rent. Unless someone had serious money saved, I would never recommend they spend more than $4-5k.

That\u2019s $245k a year. And I\u2019m betting they\u2019re probably more in the $300-$400k range. 1/3 salary is the amount of rent you should pay in a big city\n\nYes, if they make the low end, $8k is a lot. But on the higher end? It\u2019s not excessive.\n\nAnd again, we don\u2019t know what this partner has done to support OPs career.\n\nThe whole $500 couch thing - and that they just won\u2019t buy a cheap couch outright when they make 4x as much - makes me think that OP is stingy", "You sometimes see very expensive cars in the parking lots of thrift stores. :)", "NTA.

If you two had witnessed the relationship deteriorate instead of headed toward marriage, I doubt you would feel the same way as you do now. The research unequivocally backs what I said; I do not have any personal experience with this, just professional experience.

How can you be financially abusive when you both have your own income. This sounds so emotionally manipulative to me. Not wanting to spend your money on luxurious places and expensive furniture is not abusive. If they want to live in luxury they need a better job. It's not fair to expect you to pay that much unless they want to split everything 50/50. You don't need to \"fit the part\" of your new job. Noone you work with will know what your house looks like.
