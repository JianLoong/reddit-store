Our current rent is about $2,000/m and various utilities run about $700/m. I make about 4x my SO so I pay all of the rent while they pay the utilities. We also shopped for our furniture together and paid equal amounts. We didn\u2019t go all out and stayed within reasonable budget. For example our couch cost $500 and my SO easily paid $250 and I paid $250. We\u2019re happy with the situation and there\u2019s been no complaints.\n\nI\u2019ve been offered a new job in a new state and we agreed to move for my job since it\u2019ll be a great stepping stone for my career and I\u2019ll be making much more (about 6x more than my SO). Also, my SO works at a job that is easily available in the new state. Furthermore, my SO is excited to move because the new state has much more opportunities and things for us to do for fun. \n\nThe problem is that my SO have been looking at places that cost between $8-10k/m while I\u2019m only comfortable with paying up to $4k/m. My SO argues that I have to look the part of my new position and the more expensive places are in better parts of the city with less crime. While that is a valid argument, my contention is that we don\u2019t have to live in the city and I\u2019m willing to commute. In addition, my SO have been looking at furniture and appliances that\u2019s far beyond what we currently have (we\u2019re not bringing anything but clothes and some items). For example, I\u2019m perfectly happy with a $500 couch but they\u2019re looking at one that cost $3k. We went back and forth until I had enough and said that I\u2019m only paying $4k/m and we\u2019re buying reasonable furniture and other household stuff. If they want to live in a luxury building or have designer stuff, they\u2019ll have to pay the difference.\n\nMy SO was hurt by this and accused me of being financially abusive and rubbing my better earnings in in their face. They\u2019ve gone to their friends and family and literally everyone is against me.

Now you SO is going further, spending more of your income without your input, because you\u2019d kinda already granted that permission. NO ONE else decides how you spend your money other than you. On top of this, involving other friends/family members makes this even worse (think abusive here). Unfortunately, I only see one solution. Leave the SO behind and transition to a LD relationship until SO chooses to grow up. \n\nPeople living together (comment limited to in the US-I only know the laws here) should always be splitting bills 50/50 and singly purchasing items, with all decisions based on the LOWER salary. You two didn\u2019t do either. You\u2019re splitting purchases (wrong) and not equally responsible for bills (also wrong). This is the only way to prevent one member of the relationship from taking advantage of the other until a lawful union of any kind occurs. After a lawful union, split the expenses any way you want-there will be legal backing for it. Doing anything else is fiscally irresponsible and disadvantages both people-ask any financial advisor (or even any self-made millionaire). Your story is proof too. Had you two initially split expenses evenly, you wouldn\u2019t be needing to argue about this now and neither of you would be feeling like the victim here (you have ground to feel this way; SO absolutely doesn\u2019t). \n\nEdited to add: 50/50 doesn\u2019t work after a lawful union.  There are dozens of acceptable ways to handle finances after that.", "You said she like NTA from this post, but I feel like you must have worded it more harshly than you\u2019re letting on.

Compromise means adopting other peoples perspective, whilst holding them accountable to do the same. If this relationship matters a good deal to you, come to terms with your collective income being shared, rather than holding on to the idea that your earnings, and your partner\u2019s earnings, are separate matters.

Losing patience with someone over shared furniture, or other household goods, is not a big deal. Failing to fully communicate why you\u2019re worried about over spending, whilst managing a big change in your lives, is more of a concern.

Unless those jokers are going to pay the difference, they can stay clear of the decision. \n\nTbh, after this episode which shows nothing but red flags, you sure your SO is the right one to be with?", "nta. if things are share so are the decisions, and your so is making the choices without your input or compromise aparently,", "I don\u2019t believe for a second that everyone is against you in this unless their entire family and friend group are all gold diggers. \nFinancial responsibility is not abuse.

We can get a really nice place for $4k/month and I would be willing to pay the entirety of the rent BECAUSE I\u2019m so happy to have you join me on this adventure. But if you want a place that\u2019s more than $4k, you need to be willing to pay the difference, because I am not willing to spend any more than 4K. If the place you want is $5k or $10k/month, I don\u2019t really care, you need to pick a place where you\u2019re comfortable with paying that difference. Otherwise, it feels like you want to spend all of the extra money I\u2019m making and that would make this move totally pointless for me. I want to save, and I want to continue being responsible. I need to know that you are I are on the same page here financially before we make this move, because otherwise I honestly don\u2019t see the relationship working out long term if we are on such different wavelengths when it comes to finances.\u201d\n\n\nAlso, not to be \u201cthat guy\u201d, but you can DEFINITELY get a NICE place in a good part of town for ~4-5k/month in any city. I lived in a good part of LA for $3k/month in a giant 1bd apartment with high ceilings and I lived overlooking the river in Manhattan in a luxury (small, but extremely nice and plenty for a couple that isn\u2019t working from home) apartment for $5k/month and had a 2 bd apartment in the upper east side for $6k/month.

Especially if you (her) aren\u2019t making enough to afford it. And I specifically picked the prices for LA and NYC because I know it\u2019s two of the MOST expensive cities you can live in, so absolutely BULLSHIT you need an $8-10k/month apartment for a couple with no kids/pets (where a 1 bed would be plenty and a 2 bd is excess if you want guests) in order to live in a nice place without high crime. Your budget is plenty assuming you aren\u2019t looking to live like a millionaire finding his trophy wife\u2019s lifestyle. \n\nShe needs to learn to make choices. She can\u2019t have everything.", "NTA - your SO is absolutely ridiculous, and you should be rethinking this relationship with someone who can so casually make accusations of abuse.", "NTA.

These decisions are made together and they aren't taking into consideration what you're saying. \n\nYou'll probably have to sit them down (if you already haven't) and go through the numbers on what both of you would be paying. \n\nMaking more does not always mean wanting to live more extravagantly.

Woman tend to make less then men because of our cultures. So we use a 64/36 split because he makes so much more then me. Everything is split this way in our household.

In effect this is largely true. You did tell them you would pay up to 4 and they're looking at places where they're going to also have to pay 4.

I really try to read these things giving people as much benefit of the doubt as I can. So at first, I was feeling like maybe OP\u2019s partner had gotten a bit too comfortable with relying on OP\u2019s good earnings and willingness to pay a greater share, and maybe had a bit of excessive enthusiasm for a posh life with there being even more money coming in. But when the accusations of abuse and the attempt to bring family pressure to bear came up, that\u2019s just such a massive red flag. That is manipulative. They made a multi step plan to try to force OP to give up their boundaries with their money.  \n\nI\u2019ve certainly seen it happen that some people, when presented with what they feel is just a massive pile of cash, go a bit nuts and feel like they can afford everything now. It\u2019s like the lottery winners that are broke in a couple years. It\u2019s definitely a sign of financial irresponsibility, but not necessarily red flag territory. I think OP was right to stand their ground there, but it seemed like something that could be worked through. However their SO, rather than acting like a true partner and working towards balance, didn\u2019t just get a bit angry and have an immature sulk about it. No. They went straight to abuse and control themselves. I would never be able to trust them after that. \n\nOP, you are very much NTA here.

If they can not work this out it could be a deal breaker for the entire relationship.  Does OP value the SO enough to meet the SO\u2019s vision of their finances?

It's one thing to go half when you were already earning more and another when you're earning six times more.
