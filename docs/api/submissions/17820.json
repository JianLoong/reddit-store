Our current rent is about $2,000/m and various utilities run about $700/m. I make about 4x my SO so I pay all of the rent while they pay the utilities. We also shopped for our furniture together and paid equal amounts. We didn\u2019t go all out and stayed within reasonable budget. For example our couch cost $500 and my SO easily paid $250 and I paid $250. We\u2019re happy with the situation and there\u2019s been no complaints.\n\nI\u2019ve been offered a new job in a new state and we agreed to move for my job since it\u2019ll be a great stepping stone for my career and I\u2019ll be making much more (about 6x more than my SO). Also, my SO works at a job that is easily available in the new state. Furthermore, my SO is excited to move because the new state has much more opportunities and things for us to do for fun. \n\nThe problem is that my SO have been looking at places that cost between $8-10k/m while I\u2019m only comfortable with paying up to $4k/m. My SO argues that I have to look the part of my new position and the more expensive places are in better parts of the city with less crime. While that is a valid argument, my contention is that we don\u2019t have to live in the city and I\u2019m willing to commute. In addition, my SO have been looking at furniture and appliances that\u2019s far beyond what we currently have (we\u2019re not bringing anything but clothes and some items). For example, I\u2019m perfectly happy with a $500 couch but they\u2019re looking at one that cost $3k. We went back and forth until I had enough and said that I\u2019m only paying $4k/m and we\u2019re buying reasonable furniture and other household stuff. If they want to live in a luxury building or have designer stuff, they\u2019ll have to pay the difference.\n\nMy SO was hurt by this and accused me of being financially abusive and rubbing my better earnings in in their face. They\u2019ve gone to their friends and family and literally everyone is against me. I thought I was right but now that I\u2019m the only one who thinks that I\u2019m right, I\u2019m not so sure.", "created_utc": 1684666500, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13npx4p/aita_for_wanting_my_so_to_pay_more_for_rent_and/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The context is that you can get a reasonable place for 4000 a month and so wants the luxury.", "NTA but your SO is and you might want to consider your future together. Accusing you of being abusive because you won't spend a lot more money than you currently are is a total AH move (this is not financial abuse BTW, not by a long shot).\n\nOf course their friends and family are going to side with their view but their opinions are entirely irrelevant.\n\nIf he doesn't want to move to somewhere you're happy to pay for and he's not happy to fork out more money for a place costing four times what you currently pay then I don't really see a future in this relationship.", "You are thinking financially responsible. No one enjoys being house poor nor keeping up with the Jones mentality. You are going to be making 6x more, but that doesn't mean you have to spend more. \n\nIf anything, you should be planning for the future. Saving to purchase your home, getting married, and potentially having a family. Heck, it isn't too early to start planning for retirement. \n\nYou should be putting away a good nest egg.

SO is the one being financially abusive when it won\u2019t be SO\u2019s money that is being spent on these items. It is probably better for you to move to the new city on your own without the burden of SO.", "Nope. This isn\u2019t about you looking the part. It\u2019s about their wishes and desires of a more affluent future. You are trying to keep costs down, while they\u2019re spending money you haven\u2019t even earned yet. I think your post title is a little misleading. You aren\u2019t asking them to spend more than they can afford, OP. They\u2019re asking YOU to spend more than you\u2019re comfortable with and crying abuse when you refuse. That\u2019s a red flag for me.

Your SO wants to benefit from the fruits of your labor without any additional cost to themselves. Unless you are hosting coworkers at your home regularly, you need function, not flash.

Anon NTA, SO needs to pump the brakes on lifestyle creep.\n\nAnd I merely live in a top 10 city so the bigger brighter spots might be different but even $4k/mo is \"you should be buying, not renting\" territory in most places in the US, something to consider OP.", "NTA. And this is not financial abuse; this is your SO feeling entitled to a larger share of your money so they can look fancy (sounds a bit gold-digger-ish).

You shutting that down is hardly financial abuse.", "NTA\n If you\u2019re paying the rent your SO doesn\u2019t get to \u201cimpose\u201d a number on you. I\u2019m assuming you also want to live somewhere decent and safe. If you guys cannot rationally discuss finances and compromise without getting family members involved then you should not be moving to another state together. Finances are a major contributor to breakups and if you guys can\u2019t communicate effectively about them you need to slow the relationship down.", "NTA. This is not financial abuse this is reining in a gold digger. Red flags!", "I think you should move to the new state alone. \n\nYour partner's primary interest seems to be your paycheck, and when you won't spend it on the luxuries they want, they go to their friends and family to pile on you for being financially abusive. No. You are being fiscally responsibly and they are being greedy and manipulative. \n\nNTA. Move solo and enjoy your new start!", "NTA, but at the moment, I'm a little less concerned about your SO's behavior than some of the other posters. More like a red flag rising up the pole. It's half mast. \n\nI would grow more concerned if OP and SO can't reach a middle (-ish) ground. OP is asking SO to move, and while that obviously doesn't require OP to spend more money than they want, OP will still have to take SO into account as far as the living space.", "NTA.\n\nIs there a rule of thumb where you come from? \nWhere I come from, they say you should spend no more than a third of your income on rent.", " NTA-but unfortunately where you messed up is by not splitting the BILLS 50/50 in the first place. Now you SO is going further, spending more of your income without your input, because you\u2019d kinda already granted that permission. NO ONE else decides how you spend your money other than you. On top of this, involving other friends/family members makes this even worse (think abusive here). Unfortunately, I only see one solution. Leave the SO behind and transition to a LD relationship until SO chooses to grow up. \n\nPeople living together (comment limited to in the US-I only know the laws here) should always be splitting bills 50/50 and singly purchasing items, with all decisions based on the LOWER salary. You two didn\u2019t do either. You\u2019re splitting purchases (wrong) and not equally responsible for bills (also wrong). This is the only way to prevent one member of the relationship from taking advantage of the other until a lawful union of any kind occurs. After a lawful union, split the expenses any way you want-there will be legal backing for it. Doing anything else is fiscally irresponsible and disadvantages both people-ask any financial advisor (or even any self-made millionaire). Your story is proof too. Had you two initially split expenses evenly, you wouldn\u2019t be needing to argue about this now and neither of you would be feeling like the victim here (you have ground to feel this way; SO absolutely doesn\u2019t). \n\nEdited to add: 50/50 doesn\u2019t work after a lawful union.  There are dozens of acceptable ways to handle finances after that.", "You said she like NTA from this post, but I feel like you must have worded it more harshly than you\u2019re letting on. Sounds like it wasn\u2019t much of a lay bump if you moved to a higher cost of living area. Maybe explain that to her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Singapore and NYC are the most expensive cities in the world and average Manhattan rent is $4600 per Google. It's a valid concern that your SO seems to have champagne taste on a beer budget.

You were right to say if he wants something so much, he's free to make up the difference from his income.\n\nAnd I'm sorry, you do not have to \"look the part\" by inflating your lifestyle for any job. At most you may have to upgrade your wardrobe depending on the role/level/industry. Having a luxury apartment in the center of a city is not a requirement for any job. This is how people who keep getting better jobs, never managed to make financial progress. Every time they get an extra dollar, they immediately spend it. \n\nWhat you're doing by keeping your costs in check even with a big pay bump is very smart. You'll be able to weather the unexpected. You could buy a house one day. Or you could just keep squirreling away money until you don't have to work anymore (but can choose to). You're creating choices for future you. \n\nYou and your SO should have a conversation about expectations and attitudes on money. If you're on different pages on this you need to take a hard look at where this is going.

Jumping on this comment to add that being compatible about how to handle finances is very important in relationships.  If you see this as a possible long-term relationship then you need to have a conversation with your SO about each of your expectations regarding financial goals, budgeting, savings, retirement, etc.  This topic is going to constantly reappear in your relationship.
