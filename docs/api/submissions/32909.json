He also has two older children from previous relationships. This morning I was a little overwhelmed taking care of everything. I was in the middle of making two different batches of pancakes, our four year old was asking for stuff, the baby screaming etc. Anyways, I finished the pancakes for the 4yo and already had the other pancakes on the griddle. I was stirring with one hand, flipping with the other, and I asked my husband (he was just dressed and not busy and had already had his coffee while I got the kids changed and dressed) if he could please cut our 4yo pancakes. When I looked back at my daughter\u2019s plate I saw HUGE chunks. Like almost just quarters pancakes. For reference, the pancakes were bigger than my 4yo head. I asked why he cut them so big and he said he didn\u2019t. I asked what he was talking about and said he\u2019s cut her food before, he knows that\u2019s ridiculously big. He doubles down. I say it\u2019s too big for even an adult and ask why he won\u2019t just admit it because this is crazy. He tells me that\u2019s how he would cut pancakes for me. I ask him to make them smaller. \n\nI am cooking and putting other food on the table when I notice it\u2019s been a long time and he\u2019s still cutting? I look and he\u2019s going to town making them tiny now. I ask him to just stop and he gets more upset and I have to ask multiple times for the plate. He says \u201cyou wanted me to cut them smaller\u201d. I tell him yes, but now he\u2019s making a production. He says he isn\u2019t and is getting more aggressive. \n\nI then took pictures. He got very upset I took pictures and I told him this is called weaponized incompetence and it\u2019s not okay. He refused to admit he knew the pieces were too big or that he was then making a production. Now I think maybe I am in the wrong. \n\nI measured the pieces for this post. The original pieces were three inches by two inches and the new pieces were less than half and inch by half an inch .\n\nAITA for asking him to cut them and then saying they were too big?\n\nEdit to add this link of the before and after and add that the color of the pancake is her preference. \n\nEdit to add: today is our SUNDAY, he has Mondays and Tuesdays off work. His other children do not live here, it\u2019s only our two children, not 4. I included his other children in the post so you would understand he knows how to cut pancakes for children as he has done it many times before. \n\nEdit 59 add: she can\u2019t rip her pancakes because of sensory issues and he knows exactly how to cut her pancakes because he\u2019s done it hundreds of times, this wasn\u2019t something new for him.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/wXmBQoa\n", "created_utc": 1702400833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gqrkx/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_cut_our_4_year_olds/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In this case, probably you should have not said anything and let your 4 year old eat tiny pancake bites. The key is to not get caught up in an argument about what is real or reasonable because that is an invitation for him to play mind games. Say your piece and when he contests whether it's real or reasonable or whatever,  just shrug and say 'thats okay. This is the way it seemed to me and I know it's different from your perspective.'

Anyone who doesn't is just lazy.\n\n\"I asked my husband (he was just dressed and not busy and had already had his coffee while I got the kids changed and dressed) if he could please cut our 4yo pancakes.\" \n\nOh you mean like that? And then afterwards he had a hissy fit about it?\n\nHonestly if you can't figure out how to cut a pancake without someone spelling it out for you, there's no hope for you.", "I was just about to say, known troll, don't feed it", "You and me both ain't no mama got time to use a knife and fork for pancakes.", "i did. your baby will be old enough to rip up their own soon. your kids could have sleepovers with friends or cousins.  \ni\u2019m saying you don\u2019t have to cut any of their pancakes. they can rip up their own.", "Oh I\u2019ve done that too! The McGriddles gave me the idea. My kid is a dipper though so we must also put a puddle on the plate \ud83e\udd23 some kind of sauce puddle must be present for almost all meals lol", "Makes total sense thanks for the additional information. Good luck\n\nWe use syrup as a dip so I sometimes forget people put them on their kids stuffs.", "I gotta ask why you're making life so difficult for yourself. You've got four kids in the house and a husband who can't be counted on. Making pancakes on a Tuesday morning is sweet, but boy howdy are you setting yourself up for misery by doing that\u2014that goes double for making *two different kinds of pancakes*. On a Tuesday! Why!!! \n\nAgain, that's a nice gesture, but maybe simplify the breakfast routine until your kids are more self-sufficient.", "I suspect if he knew he didn't have an audience, he'd lose interest in cutting the pancake. However, he sounds possibly as petty as you suggest. In either case, I think OP should have avoided engaging with his pettiness, thank him for cutting the pancake and given it to her child. How am I suggesting she do anything that punishes her child?", "I am not criticizing you. I get why you handled it the way you did. If he wants to bait you though, the real issue isn't about pancakes.", "Yes pancake tax!", "Ok what does that mean? Hahaha I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know how to Reddit very well", "There are children involved and this is one of those easier said than done things. And not everyone in a relationship like this will be able to recognize it. If they did, no one would ever be in an abusive relationship.", "So feed her something else.", "He cut the pancakes. If you want them cut a different way, then specify that! I have to specify regularly to my bf where certain things go. Is it going to happen? Yes. Is it a little irritating? Yes. Do I care? Because there's a bigger picture that he's there, trying, at all? No. \n\nMaybe people wouldn't need weaponized incompetence if people would treat each other as competent.\nWhy don't you just be f**king grateful that you have a husband and kids. Although it wouldn't hurt him to step up a little either. Hopefully he will know for next time.\nBut it sounds to me like another on the way to single parenthood over petty crap", "Well there wasn\u2019t 4 kids to cut pancakes for. You made that up yourself. I asked him to cut our 4 year olds pancakes. That\u2019s it.", "Do you eat them with your fingers then instead of a fork? I've never seen someone dip pancakes instead of drizzling the syrup over them", "You are assuming I\u2019m making life difficult for myself when making pancakes only takes a few minutes and it\u2019s easy to do for me and both kids like it. I thought it would be simple to ask my husband to just simply cut a pancake which would take him 10 seconds. Mondays and Tuesdays are his days off from work so he wasn\u2019t in a hurry to go anywhere. He had no plans today. I got up with both kids I got them changed. I got them dressed. I did bathtime I started making breakfast. I left him completely alone all morning gave him time to be alone in peace and drink his coffee. The only thing I asked of him was to cut up our four-year-old pancake when my hands were full, and I was in the middle of other things.", "Because he wasn't stopping cutting the pancake into crumbs until she forced him to hand over the plate. \n\nAnd as I said,\n\n\"the poor kid is going to have an ice cold pancake that is very frustrating to eat and she may not even have enough time to eat before they have to leave if there's school or daycare.\"", "[https://imgur.com/](https://imgur.com/) You upload them there, then link them here. It's the same as using google drive or photobucket back in the day or whatever.", "Tax means that they want pics\n\nUsually if someone talks about their dog on Reddit, the \u201ctax\u201d for getting their answers is to post pics of their dog so ppl can awe at them, for example.\n\nIn this case it\u2019s a bit more of a joke, but also could be relevant to determining if you\u2019re an AH or they are (your husband is).", "Exactly my point, there are children involved in this.", "Why should a kid be denied pancakes just because their dad is too lazy to spend a minute or less cutting one up for them? It's such an easy task I'd happily do it for anyone's kid, never mind my own.", "You think instead of the father helping feed his child, she should stop making an easy food for her to cook, that the child probably enjoys eating, and make the child something else? In the middle of a meal?\n\nI thought you all hated \"catering\" to kids.", "He has 4 children. Does he not know the appropriate sizes for food for children by now?", "\"Why don't you just be f**king grateful that you have a husband and kids\" holy moly I've never read something like this, where does that come from?, having those things doesn't mean everything is perfect, that man is still useless at doing something so simple like cutting a pancake in bite size bites, I can't believe I'm seeing someone defend weaponized incompetence, stop treating your man like a child, he should be an adult that doesn't need everything explained to him because he is a grown person", "you\u2019re not reading my comment correctly.  \nthe 4 kids sum came from *my* family anecdote.  \nthe point is that you don\u2019t have to have these stupid arguments with your useless husband, because your kid is perfectly capable of ripping up her own.", "Such a weirdly aggressive response. Sounds like you've got a lot of anger maybe about other things and you overreacted about the pancakes?", "Some of us don\u2019t like syrup soaked into our pancakes/waffles/French toast. We do so we can control the amount of syrup per bite. That\u2019s how you get the perfect bite instead of just a mouthful of syrup. \n\nWhen I was a kid, I used to make syrup sandwiches as a treat/snack sometimes. Essentially, two pieces of white bread with a liberal amount of syrup poured in between and soaked in. \n\nKid me was like \u201cyay! Sugar!\u201d. Adult me is having a heart attack just thinking about it. \n\nStrangely enough, even then I wouldn\u2019t soak a pancake!", "Well my toddler dips some with her fingers, some with her fork and sometimes she tries with her spoon but that usually just results in a spoonful of syrup lol. I do dip with my fork cause I don\u2019t like the pancakes getting soggy since I eat slow", "Hi.\nI hadn't heard about peope dipping them till last year.\nMy family as a whole pours Syrup on pancakes.\nLike I even know the ratio to prevent sogginiess and how fluffy I need to make pancakes. (I do put butter in the batter though)", "Does he do stuff like this often?", "Omg. I forgot about photo bucket!!! I was able to do coding for my MySpace page too\u2026yet I can\u2019t figure out the link you sent\u2026I\u2019m trying lol", "My kid isn\u2019t like you though, she\u2019s like herself and she will not rip up pancakes. He knows this. He\u2019s always known this. Nothing has changed in the past 3 years", "Was that golden syrup? I used to do that too!", "My teeth hurt reading about your sandwiches lol", "I don\u2019t like it on my food either.  I dip as well.", "Click \"new post\". Upload your picture. Copy and paste the link.", "okay i\u2019m pretty over arguing about this, but why won\u2019t your kid rip up some bread?  \nthe whole point of my original comment was to save you an argument & now we\u2019re arguing.  \nit\u2019s also one of my favorite childhood stories. my parents poured the syrup because we overdid it. every time, my brother would point to each piece & say \u201ci want it on dis one, & dis one, & dis one\u2026\u201d", "Mine too! Wtf was I thinking???  Tbf, we weren\u2019t well off. But I\u2019m sure there were better/healthier options.

She just turned 4 guys, she likes her pancakes light and can\u2019t use a knife yet, nothing wrong with that.", "Oof. Might wanna edit that link into the main post. Those small pieces are just being an asshole."]}
