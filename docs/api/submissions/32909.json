He also has two older children from previous relationships. This morning I was a little overwhelmed taking care of everything. I was in the middle of making two different batches of pancakes, our four year old was asking for stuff, the baby screaming etc. Anyways, I finished the pancakes for the 4yo and already had the other pancakes on the griddle. I was stirring with one hand, flipping with the other, and I asked my husband (he was just dressed and not busy and had already had his coffee while I got the kids changed and dressed) if he could please cut our 4yo pancakes. When I looked back at my daughter\u2019s plate I saw HUGE chunks. Like almost just quarters pancakes. For reference, the pancakes were bigger than my 4yo head. I asked why he cut them so big and he said he didn\u2019t. I asked what he was talking about and said he\u2019s cut her food before, he knows that\u2019s ridiculously big. He doubles down. I say it\u2019s too big for even an adult and ask why he won\u2019t just admit it because this is crazy. He tells me that\u2019s how he would cut pancakes for me. I ask him to make them smaller. \n\nI am cooking and putting other food on the table when I notice it\u2019s been a long time and he\u2019s still cutting? I look and he\u2019s going to town making them tiny now. I ask him to just stop and he gets more upset and I have to ask multiple times for the plate. He says \u201cyou wanted me to cut them smaller\u201d. I tell him yes, but now he\u2019s making a production. He says he isn\u2019t and is getting more aggressive. \n\nI then took pictures. He got very upset I took pictures and I told him this is called weaponized incompetence and it\u2019s not okay. He refused to admit he knew the pieces were too big or that he was then making a production. Now I think maybe I am in the wrong. \n\nI measured the pieces for this post. The original pieces were three inches by two inches and the new pieces were less than half and inch by half an inch .\n\nAITA for asking him to cut them and then saying they were too big?\n\nEdit to add this link of the before and after and add that the color of the pancake is her preference. \n\nEdit to add: today is our SUNDAY, he has Mondays and Tuesdays off work. His other children do not live here, it\u2019s only our two children, not 4. I included his other children in the post so you would understand he knows how to cut pancakes for children as he has done it many times before. \n\nEdit 59 add: she can\u2019t rip her pancakes because of sensory issues and he knows exactly how to cut her pancakes because he\u2019s done it hundreds of times, this wasn\u2019t something new for him.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/wXmBQoa\n", "created_utc": 1702400833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gqrkx/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_cut_our_4_year_olds/", "score": 196, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The key is to not get caught up in an argument about what is real or reasonable because that is an invitation for him to play mind games. Say your piece and when he contests whether it's real or reasonable or whatever,  just shrug and say 'thats okay. This is the way it seemed to me and I know it's different from your perspective.'

Maybe not. Immature yes. Selfish yes. Even having this conversation you\u2019d rather defend hope it makes sense and is ok for you to make your wife manage your home and family because you \u201chelp\u201d and aren\u2019t having a - is this a justified stance? Can I do more for my partner?\n\nA good man cares enough to want to share the burden.", "Ugh please stop commenting on my post already.", "Nope.\n\nHe knew what the job was and he didn\u2019t do it.\n\nJust like if he \u201ccut the lawn\u201d by taking a pair of scissors out and clipping a dandelion. \n\nHe\u2019s not Amelia Bedelia.", "Why did he separate from his ex?\n\nIt sounds concerning that he married someone younger. And acted a certain way. Lies that he will change. And leaves you will all the work. What\u2019s the likelihood he will actually change?", "I didn't mean dry like an insult to your food. I meant that what I enjoy about maple syrup on pancakes isn't just the flavor, it's also the contrast in textures between the fluffy, cakey pancakes and the drippy, sticky syrup. I'd miss out on that enjoyment if I didn't have liquid syrup.", "Tools to help communication in her marriage is work\u2026. Marriage is work. Kids are work. Living with another person long term is work. Life is work. Are we just starting the obvious? \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m a married woman who has been through something similar and worse and decided to work on my marriage. It\u2019s working and it\u2019s also still work. But I\u2019m really happy with how much we\u2019ve grown together and being more open and vulnerable with eachother.", "She\u2019s not being denied pancakes. She\u2019s being denied her specifically cut up into 1.243 inch pieces pancakes which, this kid is gonna be a nightmare if she\u2019s getting away with this now.", "i feel bad for their daughter. pancake mornings are a happy, carefree childhood memory. this girl is gonna remember her parents having a dumb argument.", "Girl. You know being an actual maid would be more rewarding than living like this.", "Have you tried the fair play game? It\u2019s a way to talk about chores and what it means to be fully completed and who takes on responsibility for those chores. I think he\u2019s not aware of how little he does. And this card game gives a visual for what it looks like and how fair or unfair the balance is. I take on a lot more household and childcare roles but I am home more and my husband is now more aware of how much I do and is more understanding to what\u2019s going on at home. He most likely literally has no idea and thinks it\u2019s no big deal. So he needs to start seeing it if you want this to work.", "Well that\u2019s a different problem.", "Are you sure though? Just start asking more and see what happens. If he doesn\u2019t do things when you ask, maybe you need to move on.", "Probably why you\u2019re single.", "So you just want everyone to agree with you? Nah I\u2019m good, I\u2019ll keep it up.", "What was the reaction of the 4 year old when she saw the size of the pancakes?", "So he didn\u2019t cut the pancakes?", "Ah. I mainly just do it for my toddler.", "*You* decided to work on *your* marriage. OP's husband doesn't want to work on his marriage or on anything, apparently.\n\nThis is not a communication issue. This is a husband who just doesn't give a fuck", "Normal sized bites of pancakes is not \"specifically cut up\". It's is appropriately cut for her age, not too large to be comfortable to eat, and not crumbs.", "we really need to stop giving guys a pass for treating their wives like shit.", "Why is she in charge of asking? Why isn't he equally responsible for noticing what needs to be done and doing it without being asked?", "LMAO you needed therapy (!!) for someone to tell you to help clean up your own dirt around the place you live and you\u2019re judging people?", "No I don\u2019t, I just feel that you make a lot of excuses for men.", "She had to eat different pancakes cut the way she always has them cut. Again, he has always cut them the same for three years. He knows the drill.", "Yikes. It\u2019s all communication. And I don\u2019t think you can speak for someone that\u2019s not even in here. He\u2019s def an asshole but we can\u2019t really say whether he wants to work on this or not or if there\u2019s something going on for him that\u2019s making it harder for him to focus. I\u2019m not a therapist and we can\u2019t ask him.", "So communicating and making them more aware is giving them a pass? I really think too many men are brought up unaware and it takes someone showing them to realize. I\u2019m not saying it works every time but if they\u2019re ignorant then show them your experience and it might change them.", "Is there something wrong with asking?", "Whatever works. At the end of the day, it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s not the only woman that\u2019s dealt with this problem. Isn\u2019t the goal to give some positive advice on this?", "How am I making excuses? What is it that you want? Are you willing to help your partner step up or do you want out. I think needing validation from strangers about the size of a cut pancake is evenly petty. So here we are. I get it, he did his pettiness first blah blah blah. This is what happens when you feed your business to the general public.", "Why is it that big of a deal?", "OP has mentioned in other comments multiple occasions where she's communicated her issues, he improves briefly, and a few days later he's back to square one. She has *been* communicating, and he's not putting in the effort.", "I'm just waiting for you to get to \"OP I know he's a petty asshole who won't lift a finger and will deliberately fuck up any task you give him but have you considered he's probably autistic?\" because you're so sure he's got some non-asshole reason for behaving like an asshole.\n\nI know you feel that way about your husband, but your husband isn't OP's husband (plus he is also an asshole)"]}
