It sounds like the rest of his family have no idea that he wasn't including you, so I wouldn't blame them. However, you should have a serious talk with your husband about WHY he didn't want you to come to dinner and WHY he wasn't honest with his mother and sister about it. It was very unkind for him to leave you out of the party. You deserve better.", "NTA. Your husband has let you know that he's about to tap out of your relationship. Be wise.", "Why did you cover for him? Why not flat out say \"[husband] said he wanted time with just you two and asked me not to go\"?\n\nIt's concerning that you felt the need to save face for your husband like this. It also seems like your husband knows he's out of line and would upset his mother by doing this, and is making you be the bad guy. NOT okay.  Potentially also a sign of isolation.\n\nAlso the level of hurt you feel - do you tend to have problems with low self esteem? Rejection is never fun, of course, but if you struggle to feel worthy then it can make you more vulnerable to mistreatment.\n\nThere's some red flags here.\n\nWanting just a \"mom and her kid-kids\" birthday is fine. My partner has done that and if MIL asked me why I wasn't going I'd point out how she's my partner's mum and he doesn't get a lot of time just her and this is important to him.  Because I know he's tried telling her this and she kind of ignores it and it's something that irritates me about her but I'm getting off topic.\n\nBut none of the way this has been handled is good.", "Husband is the AH. \nI'd be suspicious of what his true intentions are.", "NTA, this is weirdo behavior from your husband.

I would never get upset if my husband said he wanted to spend him mothers birthday alone with her.", "ok yes a bit of melodrama in my simile but my point is it was super awkward to like take photos of the group that met at our home to leave and go get dinner. and then be like. oh, well. bye then! like meet at the restaurant or leave me out of it. that\u2019s all. it just felt like i was josie grossie and it took me back to insecure high school days! lol sue me!", "this is basically the conversation we had", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 yes! Damn him to hell for wanting a dinner with his mom and sister. Divorce him now!", "So you can never have alone time with members of your family without your spouse?", "What are you 12? You think wanting to spend alone time with your mother and sister is grounds for divorce? Honestly she should get a divorce and then get some therapy for her attachment and self esteem issues", "yeah. it was more the talking about this dinner earlier in the week and not mentioning it was not including me\u2026 and then surprising me like 3 hours before that i wasn\u2019t invited the whole time. but then alll these ppl being like leave him it\u2019s divorce for you made me realize it\u2019s NOT that deep. lol", "succinct \ud83d\ude39", "then when his mom and sister asked why she wasn't coming, he needed to be the one to step in and say that he had asked for her not to come instead of leaving her in an awkward positron where she has to either lie or risk start a huge family argument", "yikes. im sorry to hear this and hope this isn\u2019t a harbinger of divorce for us!", "i\u2019ll let you know if your assessment proves correct. at present we talked it through. he did shit communication and i got in my feelings. we will see", "Seriously! The leaps that commenters take are astonishing! Who thinks like this? Hubby wants family time with mom and sister \u2026. So obviously he is going to divorce you. What crazy hysteria.", "tbh it made me snap out of it and feel better. i think iata for asking reddit \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude07", "And \"spend time with the family\" hit me wrong too because since when is a SPOUSE not family???", "I don't have one ahahah I just turned 21yo last week! But I mean he could have said it differently. Saying it's \"family only\" makes it seem like he's excluding OP from the family, which OP is supposed to be a part of since they're married. I'm all for still being an individual person even in a relationship and doing your own things with your own people, I just think it could have been said differently and the situation probably wouldn't have been the same. The way he said it made it hurtful.", "Right! I am surprised by these answers.", "He can, but to not tell his mom he wanted it to be just siblings and wasn't inviting his wife is weird and a red flag. \n\nIf the mom is asking why they aren't coming its because she assumed he would bring his wife and wasn't against it. So yes, it's weird.", "Discuss something privately (so privately he can't discuss it in front of his wife) in the middle of a fancy restaurant? Even if that's what his plan was, that's actually even worse. She's his *wife* and therefore part of the family. He sent a message loud and clear that she wasn't on this occasion. That makes it look even more like he's tapping out of the relationship.", "He and his sister were taking her out. MIL didn\u2019t plan this and he uninvited her.", "Was it really that awkward?", "It\u2019s not that awkward goodness. Her response was fine. I agree that he could have said something in that moment, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal. I would have said something along the lines of \u201cI would come, but son wants you all to himself.\u201d I just don\u2019t see why it\u2019s such a big deal.", "So a husband can no longer spend time with his mom and sister without his wife?", "Also he could spend time with his family any other day, a weekend, IDK, but his mom is part of his wife's family now and exclude her to her mil birthday was just so hurtful and rude to say the least. And he didnt even tell his mother, making OP seem like the bad guy for not wanting to celebrate the day with them.", "Some of the commenters literally cling onto their spouses, whilst this post I think op is NTA. Some people quite literally are clingy, needy people who need to learn how to not spend every waking second with their spouse.", "Not telling your spouse they aren't invited to a Family dinner is weird. The lack of communication IS weird, cause it's such a small request idk why you WOULDN'T tell them.\n\nIt may not be the gigantic red flag some people are making it out to be but the consensus that it's weird feels like an accurate read of the info given.", "I disagree. If I am taking someone out for their birthday I don\u2019t give them those types of details. In that moment he could have said something, but it\u2019s not a big deal.", "YES you absolutely can have private things you want to discuss with your mother not in front of your spouse. Getting married doesn\u2019t mean that you loose all autonomy. What if he wanted to discuss something private related to mom specifically? Or he just wanted to spend time with his mom and sister.", "It's not that he could have it's that he should have. He is the one who told his wife that he doesn't want her there, meaning he needs to be the one to break the news to \"his family\" (considering he clearly doesn't feel like his wife is family in this instance) Why she's not coming. And needs to be honest about it. If you're the one making a unilateral decision, you need to be the one to own up to it and any consequences that come with that decision. \ud83e\udd37", "He could that any other day, but on a birthday where he has no say to not invite his wife since it was not his birthday but his mom's whom was surprised to see her dl not going to celebrate her day? No... This was so strange... really", "Yeah I forgot it but that's also a huge part! He didn't even tell his mother that he didn't invite OP to her birthday and just let this awkward situation happen! It is not even like the MIL didn't want OP to come and just wanted to spend her birthday with her son and daughter, the whole thing is just literally her husband not wanting her to go and that's weird and hurtful!", "He could have told her before day off, although he probably didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal\u2026..because it shouldn\u2019t be.", "We'll agree to disagree because I think he's being sus.", "So what if they didn\u2019t know? He was taking mom out somewhere special for her birthday. He didn\u2019t need to give her all of the details as to who was coming.", "When taking someone out for their birthday, you absolutely have a right regarding who to invite. For example, say you wanted to just take her on a surprise mother and son dinner. Does he have to tell mom that dad isn\u2019t invited? Wanting to spend special moments alone with your parents is completely ok. It would be different if Mom was planning this and son uninvited her.", "overly aggressive for no reason but it matters because OPs mil and sil expected her to come. its fine for him to spend time with his wife but why the need to lie to his mom and sister", "I'll not say u are wrong, but this situation was so strange, he could at least say the truth to his family, instead OP had to make excuses when her MIL asked why she was not coming, dont you agree? In this case OP's husband was the AH", "Where is the lie? You don\u2019t know what he said to them once they got in the car as to why he asked her not to come. They expected her to\nCome because she always comes. He has the right to want to spend an evening away from her. She sounds extremely attached.", "It pisses me off so much when people are like \u201cNope you\u2019re wrong and I\u2019m right.\u201d", "The question has two parts. \n\n1. Is she wrong for being upset her husband wanted to have a dinner with just his mother and sister?\n2. Was he wrong for how he handled it by not being forthright about the fact he asked her to stay home.\n\nI answered both. \n\n1. It's okay for her husband to occasionally want to see his family without her. She was wrong for being upset by that.\n2. He was wrong because of how he handled it. \n\nIf it makes you feel better, I'll officially change my answer to say they were both wrong in different ways. But, again, OP understood what I was saying, and since she is the person I was addressing, hers is the only opinion I am concerning myself with. \n\nThis will be my last reply because OP and I understand each other, so I'm not going to get embroiled in arguments other people wish to have.", "I do think he could have said something at that moment, but I don\u2019t think he put her in this super awkward position. Her response was fine. For all we know he cleaned it up in the car and they understand. Unless they start treating OP differently because they felt slighted, this seems like a mountain out of a molehill. As someone else mentioned if the situation were\nSwitched and she wanted to have girl time with mom and sister we would say husband was being an AH.", "ive seen your other posts your not worth the time to continue this discussion come back when you can calmly and rationally talk", "Where did it say he told her not to tell them he asked her not to come?", "Bye", "Don\u2019t let it go. Make it clear if he pulls this again, you will tell his family what actually happened.", "Oh my goodness you sound like you have attachment issues. No wonder he didn\u2019t want to invite you. It was MILs birthday dinner that he was doing for her. He can do it how he wants to do it and is not obligated to invite you. You\u2019re making this all about you and it\u2019s not even your birthday. What if he wanted to discuss something with them privately? I couldn\u2019t imagine feeling so entitled to someone else\u2019s birthday.", "If you are planning something for someone you plan it how you want to plan it. Maybe he wanted to discuss something with her in private and she doesn\u2019t know about it yet."]}
