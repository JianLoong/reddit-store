It sounds like the rest of his family have no idea that he wasn't including you, so I wouldn't blame them. However, you should have a serious talk with your husband about WHY he didn't want you to come to dinner and WHY he wasn't honest with his mother and sister about it. It was very unkind for him to leave you out of the party. You deserve better.", "NTA. Your husband has let you know that he's about to tap out of your relationship. Be wise.", "Why did you cover for him? Why not flat out say \"[husband] said he wanted time with just you two and asked me not to go\"?\n\nIt's concerning that you felt the need to save face for your husband like this. It also seems like your husband knows he's out of line and would upset his mother by doing this, and is making you be the bad guy. NOT okay.  Potentially also a sign of isolation.\n\nAlso the level of hurt you feel - do you tend to have problems with low self esteem? Rejection is never fun, of course, but if you struggle to feel worthy then it can make you more vulnerable to mistreatment.\n\nThere's some red flags here.\n\nWanting just a \"mom and her kid-kids\" birthday is fine. My partner has done that and if MIL asked me why I wasn't going I'd point out how she's my partner's mum and he doesn't get a lot of time just her and this is important to him.  Because I know he's tried telling her this and she kind of ignores it and it's something that irritates me about her but I'm getting off topic.\n\nBut none of the way this has been handled is good.", "Husband is the AH. \nI'd be suspicious of what his true intentions are.", "NTA, this is weirdo behavior from your husband.
