I think your mom asking for a plus one for moral support was completely reasonable. NTA.", "Nta if sil continue to do this your brother might have to go nc with a lot people from his side. Next one might be your sister who her daughter have good relationship with grandma. I understand it your brother's wedding he can decided who he want here or not. But your mother have feeling and if she doesn't want to apologize and in his life anymore he have to accept that.", "NTA A simple request about a wedding  invitation got blown out of proportion. Everyone behaved less than admirably. Your brother and is wife don't care if they are right, they care if they are in control of the situation and it's narrative.\n\n>...my brother told my mom she wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding or wouldn\u2019t meet their unborn child till she apologised to his wife than to add insult to injury they had dads new wife (who he cheated on mom with btw) take over the mother of the groom role.\n\nYour mother has no intention of apologizing and has respected their wishes. It sounds like she's the only person who isn't causing a fuss. She's made her peace with the situation and has behaved appropriately in this situation. If it upsets your brother and makes his wife fly off the handle, oh well, careful what you wish for as the saying goes.", "NTA. Your brother and his wife sound manipulative. They hold the children over your and your mother's heads like a bargaining chip. They chose to live this way and will soon find that they are all alone once they alienate everyone.", "NTA. Seems like a pattern of behaviour here. Someone does something your SIL doesn't like, things escalate to a fight, she demands an apology or will refuse to talk to you, then feels hard done by when people accept her conditions.\n\nIt *was* their right to reject your mother having a plus one, it would have been nice though. It was *cruel* to shove it in her face by having her ex husband's affair partner take up her role at the wedding. It's entirely selfish and completely lacking in empathy for them to think that they don't owe your mother an apology (she owes them one too). It's actually insane to think that rejecting her makes her a bad grandmother.", " NTA. If anything he should be blaming his wife.", "NTA.  Your brother and his wife seem to lack the ability to connect their actions to the consequences. She threatened to cut you off, then accused ***you*** of throwing them away? They literally replaced your mother with your father's affair partner and they are waiting for her to apologize to ***them?*** If the destruction of familial relationships causes them pain, they should stop destroying them.", "NTA. You're right. He did bring it up & you gave him your opinion. It's not your fault that he didn't like what you had to say. Block your brother & his wife. They started this whole mess by refusing to let your mom bring a +1. Yet let your dad bring one. \n\nYour mom deserved better than that & is showing him the consequences of his actions by cutting him out of her life.", "NTA \n\nYour mother took your brother and his wife at their word - if she didn\u2019t apologize (and it sounds like they both should have) then she can be part of their or their children\u2019s lives.  Don\u2019t give ultimatums like that if you don\u2019t like the fallout of them. \n\nMy former SIL used to get super mad that my mom kept my kids for overnights and so I could do things.  She said it wasn\u2019t fair.  But she didn\u2019t consider the fact that for 3 years she absolutely refused to allow anyone to keep her child and rarely even let us hold her.  She was the one who set it up that no one asked to keep her child\nBecause she\u2019s constantly said no for 3 years so people just stopped asking/offering", "NTA. Is your sister next? You didn't throw them away, your SIL threw you away. Can he really not see this?\n\nAnyway he better get used to this because his wife has a pattern of behavior. Ultimatums, demands of apology and the sinners going \"no, I'm good\".", "NTA. You didn\u2019t stick your nose in anything. Your brother brought it up and you told him what you thought. Seems like all of this stems from you SIL. If I were you, I\u2019d talk to your brother and tell him that. She\u2019s holding him and their kids up like they\u2019re some sort of prize for doing things her way and her way only, and then gets mad if people aren\u2019t willing to agree to that. He may not listen, but brother needs to hear that it\u2019s her that\u2019s keeping his family away from him, not his family.", "\u201c I said ok than go low contact to which she scream something I couldn\u2019t understand than hung up\u201d\n\nLMAO good for you\n\nNTA what they did to your mom was BEYOND cruel. Stick with your mom.", "NTA. \n\nYou have to live with your own integrity even if it pisses off other people. Your SIL sounds very threatened by her husband having any strong relationships with anyone but her. That\u2019s too bad, but it\u2019s not your doing.", "NTA.  So mom was supposed to go to a wedding alone where her cheating ex-husband & mistress were attending?  She couldn\u2019t bring a friend for support?  How cruel.", "Is it possible he\u2019s in an abusive relationship and is getting steadily cut off from everyone? NTA, but what is up?", "NTA. You didn\u2019t throw your brother away. His wife made the decision to toss YOU away unless or until SHE got what she wanted. You simply didn\u2019t cave to her demands. If your brother is upset, he should talk to his wife who has no problem speaking for him and tossing his family away.", "NTA \n\nI've seen women like this sil.  Not at all pleasant to be around and not worth the efforts it takes to get along. I can't bend that far backwards anymore. Poor guy is stuck.", "Nta\n\nI'd reach out to your brother and tell him how sad you are that he let his wife throw you and your mother away so easily. \n\nI'd also point out the additional layer of, how hes not talking to your mom for the same reason she isn't to him.\n\nThey all wanted it THEIR way or the highway.\nSo, in reality, they all got what they wanted. \n\nThough I will say, your mother seems to be the other side of this coin. I can imagine where your brother gets his stubbornness\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA, He made his bed...", "YTA you\u2019re literally taking your mothers side otherwise you would\u2019ve kept your mouth shut. ESH in the initial argument that started all this but all you\u2019re doing is making your brothers life harder. \n\nBut to your brothers defense your mother and you did what women always do. Made it about y\u2019all in both situations and ganged up on him which is no surprise. At least he found him a spouse who\u2019s a ride or die and isn\u2019t afraid of the the females in his family and let them steam roll her.
