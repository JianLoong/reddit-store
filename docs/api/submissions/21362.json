It sounds like she's the only person who isn't causing a fuss. She's made her peace with the situation and has behaved appropriately in this situation.

It was *cruel* to shove it in her face by having her ex husband's affair partner take up her role at the wedding. It's entirely selfish and completely lacking in empathy for them to think that they don't owe your mother an apology (she owes them one too). It's actually insane to think that rejecting her makes her a bad grandmother.", " NTA. If anything he should be blaming his wife.", "NTA.

Get him out of there.", "I\u2019m wondering if their mother told the brother that his fianc\u00e9e was crazy and manipulative during that fight and that\u2019s why the wife so vehemently believes she deserves an apology and went no contact.. seems like brother doesn\u2019t like hearing facts he probably already knows deep down", "Why apologize? Brother and SIL are acting like petulant children. They need to get over themselves. If OP is of such little value to them that they would drop him like that for not agreeing with them, why should OP want a relationship with them? It is extremely conditional.", "Why does OP taking the mother's side make him an AH?\n\nAnd yes, the brother's life is hard because of all the unreasonable 'boundaries' put up by OP's SIL. That makes her an AH, not the OP.", "Oh yes NYA. But your brother and SIL are huge AH", "Someone should ask Bro/SIL how the NC thing is working out for them.  Especially since they\u2019ve now doubled down with OP.", "Honestly it sounds kind of like threatening them with a good time with respect to the SIL. Who would want to have a lot of contact with this woman?", "My sister threatens this all the time.\n\nGuess who the family don't speak to anymore....", "She keeps saying that everyone else is cutting them off but it is SIL who is the one doing it...", "Thier kids are up next! Whatta bunch of jerks", "It is SO WRONG to use children (nieces/nephews/grandchildren) as a tool of extortion in familial relationships (or any relationships).", ">Especially since my ex-husband was bringing his home wrecker.\n\nMy, my, my.", "I get the vibe that she is trying to isolate him", "Brother's wife controls the brother. No point to discuss with him anything cause he has no backbone with his wife anyway. It won't matter what the brother thinks.", "Agree! SIL seems great at escalating issues and getting brother alone might help descalate and talk things through. You're NTA", "Sounds kind of like she is slowly isolating him from his family. She got rid of his mom, now one of the siblings.", "And if they talk about their grandma then she will go no contact with them.", "My cousin\u2019s husband did the whole \u201cyou\u2019ll never see your grandkids\u201d thing completely out of the blue to my aunt and uncle (literally mailed them a letter) and moved my very pregnant cousin out of the state without telling them. Turns out, he had decided that cycling would be an equal alternative to taking his bipolar medication \ud83d\ude44 he got back on his meds and apologized profusely and they now get to see their grandkid, but I have to wonder if SIL is maybe missing some much-needed medication for something", "Honestly if the genders  were reversed I think more people would be picking up on the fact that isolating your partner from their support system is like step one of the abusers handbook", "If SIL reads what you wrote, she'll go NC/LC with you too!", "Main Character Syndrome for sure", "Ignore all that, NTA OP. Your brother deserves to lose family, he let his dad's mistress come but wouldn't let your mom's friend come as her support.", "I actually thought this was the SIL\u2019s account\u2026.", "I don\u2019t think anyone CAN ask, sister is the only one left and probably knows she\u2019d be cut off if she did \ud83d\ude02", "Probably go no contact if you ask her how it's working out for them", "This made me giggle.", "To be fair if someone ends in here for advice it's either the pettiest shit or absolutely a \"cut your losses and run\" situation.", "Going low or no contact is a valid choice if the situation calls for it. But if you do it you had better mean it and be prepared to deal with the consequences. OP's brother and SIL clearly were just trying to ice out the mom until they got their way. They didn't expect her to make good on their threat.", "Yes! SIL is pulling some hefty abuse Tactics here. I feel bad for OPs brother.", "thats possible, but if he is unhappy with her actions and the repercussions, it might be beneficial to try. it might be the spark that gets him away from her or plants the seed if he hasnt already. \n\nif he feels that bad about it, the family really should reach out if he wont if we are assuming that this is abuse. he wont do it on his own, he might need the helping hand..\n\nif he doesnt want to, fair, and if op doesnt want to, also fair. but this seems off, and they need to talk about it to resolve it or the problem wont go away. he obviously misses his mum, and if she cuts off op too, it might be an extra layer to make him want out. \n\ni suggest not coming at him agro if the goal is to help him, he will retreat further", "If he ever wants to leave his very controlling partner, it will matter what he thinks now. Hate to say the thing, but if the genders were reversed, there would likely be more mention of the fact that SIL's actions are driving away all of the brother's family while also being very toxic to him.\n\nObviously he has to be responsible for his own choices, but she's also manipulating the situation so there's fewer for him to make in the future.", "Can\u2019t have people around who aren\u2019t bumping uglies. If two people aren\u2019t inserting one or more thing into each other in their private time outside the wedding, how can they look acceptable in wedding photos?", "Lots of single people still get a plus 1 type if invitation.", "Thank god. She sounds exhausting.", "Oh in that case HEY OP SIL YOU SUCK AND NO ONE LIKES YOU.\n\nGet that out of way now just in case", "I think it was your low double digit IQ that was being assumed, not your gender.", "You mean like you assumed OP\u2019s???", "Fair.", "It\u2019s honestly absurd some times. I think it was here or one the other offsprings of this sub where the woman was talking about her sister who was fucking her last fianc\u00e9 and whether she was the AH for not letting same sister come to her next wedding. \n\nHmmm, this is one tough, give me a minute while I ponder on this\u2026. \n\nI can\u2019t tell if these obvious ones are fake most of the time or just looking to circle jerk about how shitty someone is.", "And yet somehow OP managed to fin an in-law who combines both.", "I had a young relative pull this nonsense on me for something so minor you wouldn't believe.  Never had a conflict with them before.  I've waited out 3 years of no speaking to see if they would finally grow a prefrontal cortex and get some sense.  Still not speaking, so I will be meeting with a lawyer this year to redirect the trust and real estate portfolio I was planning to leave them.  Let's just say it's a ma$$ive fuckup on their part.  I blame all those helicopter parents for trying to fix everything and their now-grown kids just crumble and stomp off like a toddler if someone has a minor disagreement with them.  Seriously--if they had discussed it like adults, mom could have said she wanted some moral support when faced with ex and co-cheater, DIL could have said they couldn't afford it, mom could have offered to pay for her guest's meal.  This was all about an immature young woman and control.", "I do and I don't. My brother is the same, he has a choice to support his wife or not. Every time he chooses to support her, even though the relationship withered away between us and the rest of the family.", "I've noticed that.  What is it with people? You hire a officiant, buy some flowers, and throw a party. In a pinch, you just hire an officiant. Where did all the other stuff come from? The 17 parties the bridesmaids are supposed to throw for the bride, and everyone at the wedding or walking by in the street is supposed to wear the same colours, and in the 2 years before the wedding nobody's allowed to get engaged or pregnant or get a new job or do ANYTHING that might draw attention from MY SPECIAL DAY?", "Not so much now just because it\u2019s crazy expensive. The line has to be drawn somewhere and a lot of people are making it long term/serious relationship only. That being said I don\u2019t think anyone would throw a fit if the mother of the Groom got to be the exception to that rule.", "SIL is screaming at OP's brother over this comment. You're LC/NC, and not meeting the kids!", "As someone who has questionable family members, they love to tell you that you are 100% wrong. It gets to you.   \nIt's why I barely speak to half of my family, they were raised crazy.", "This is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve heard. The status of a family members personal life means nothing in terms of an invitation. Friends I could see it. Still stupid but at least a bit more understandable. Your mother, who raised you, deserves a bit more leeway for a plus one. Especially a plus one the groom has known most of his life. Even if it was a small 50 person wedding. The mother of the groom gets to bring someone if they want.", "Yay but my birthday isn't till November. Why am I getting my present early?", "Oh yeah I think I worded my comment weird. I was saying that a lot of single people these days don\u2019t get plus ones because the cost of weddings has gone up so much since covid. BUT that even if you had the rule of only serious relationships getting them that the mother of the groom should be an exception and get a plus one."]}
