She lost that baby. They ended up getting married and 2 years ago had a child together who I never met. A few months ago they both died in a car crash that claimed five people's lives. A social worker contacted me and my sister to see if one of us would take her in. We were left until last because they wanted older bio relatives first, but none of them wanted her. My sister asked if we could raise her together. I said I was not getting involved and told the social worker I would not raise her. My sister, who is only 19, stepped up. There were some things that needed to happen first. She dropped out of her college classes (she was working during the day and going to college at night) and she needed to move into a two bedroom place instead of the one bedroom she was in. She also needed to get some background check done.\n\nBut she passed, she has the child. Now she's having a hard time with child care. She knew I wouldn't say yes so she asked our mom.

So she called me, told me she didn't want to do it, that she HATES the thought of having that child in her home and caring for her. But she knows it will ruin her relationship with my sister if she doesn't. I told her she shouldn't do it. That she would not be a good fit for one, but she would also be miserable and while my sister might not hate her, she could end up resenting them both. She agreed with me and told my sister she would not watch her.\n\nMy sister called and asked if I had anything to do with it. I played dumb and said I didn't know what she meant. She said she knew that was a lie because mom was so close to doing the right thing and suddenly she's firmly no. She called me a cunt, a bitch, said I was heartless, that one day she'll tell \"our little sister\" everything and will make me face up to my rejection of her and my lack of care for her. I told her I owe the child nothing and I would not apologize for telling mom to do what she wants. My sister then said I was cold hearted and cruel and I don't seem to care about her either. I told her I cannot pretend to give a fuck about the child dad created with his affair partner and that she would rather me stay away.

She is two years old, newly orphaned, and your half-sister. You don't have to be involved in her life if you really don't want to be, but the degree to which you openly don't care about her welfare, and to which you resent her for what your dad did, is just horrible. Your sister is wrong to lash out at you for her difficulties in finding childcare - she took on this responsibility willingly, so this is on her - but she's a better person than you are. I hope things work out for them.", "NTA.  That child is from an affair so your mom doesn't have to take care of said child.", "NTA - You and your mother effectively want no relationship to half sister. Younger sister made her bed by taking guardianship of half sister, now she needs to deal with it by herself", "NTA\n\nNot everyone likes kids, not everyone is okay watching them. It shouldn't be expected of you to watch and babysit. Your sister also needs to understand things like this take time. Barely know her and your sister is asking you to watch her weeks in? Intrusive, rude, no right to lash out or be angry.\n\nI will say however, it's fantastic that your sister took her in and she's being kept with family. And please just keep this in mind...your little sister is not your dad, she has done NOTHING wrong. Both her parents are dead, her life is upside down, she asked for none of this. \n\nYou can't change the bad past, but you can absolutely create something great with your little sister moving forward. I hope this little girl grows up to be happy and content with life, if you can contribute in some way towards that, at least think about it.", "NTA.. I feel for that child but omg this is not on you. And your 19 yo sister ruining her future to take care of this child.. without any support", "Nope, NTA x1000\n\nYour half sister is nothing to your mom, except the living representation of your father's lies and betrayal. Nothing good would come of the 3 of them together.\n\nYour mother did NOT want to help with the kid, your sister just banked on guilt tripping her and heard what she wanted to hear. You just told your mom it was okay to stands up to emotional blackmail, and draw clear boundaries.\n\nToo bad your sister is impulsive and not willing to play the long game. She could have done what she wanted to do, and not alienated both of you.\n\nThere was a work around here, she was just unwilling to compromise.\n\nSorry you and your mom are being treated this way. Peace.", "Being related to someone doesnt make you obligated to them. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You gave your mom support in her choice. You didn't force her to make that choice. Also, your half-sister would be able to pick up on it if your mom resented her. Kids aren't stupid. It's best for your sister to not be around people who will have negative feelings towards her. She and your mom are both innocent parties who are struggling enough. Your mom being pushed into caring for her will only hurt them both more.", "NTA.\n\nUltimately, your mother made the decision herself. This isn't her child and she expressed to you that she didn't want to help care for this little girl. Your sister chose to take on this responsibility, so she's gonna have to figure it out just like any other parent/guardian.", "ESH but your 2 sisters. First, that was NOT an affair child. She was born from your father\u2019s second marriage. I\u2019m sorry that the resentment that you and your mother feel for your father has trickledown to an innocent child who has no one in her life but your other sister. I do agree that if you both hate her so much just for being born you should not take care of her. Go to therapy and maybe one day if it\u2019s not too late you might find in your heart to rebuild a relationship if not with her with your other sister. If you can\u2019t find in your heart to let go of the past, please stay away from her as you do since you will only poison her with your hate and shame her for something she has no fault at all.", "NTA. I was going to say N A H until your sister called you a heartless bitch for not helping. Your dad hurt you all badly with this affair and it's hardly unreasonable that you and your mom don't want to take care of the child. Your sister has a huge heart and put the welfare of the child above her feelings - but apparently without really understanding what she was getting into. But she's not accepting that you aren't able to do the same thing. \n\nIt would be lovely if you could eventually accept the child, since she's now essentially your sister's child, and the guy who caused all the pain is gone now.", "ESH. Your dad had an affair on your mother and that\u2019s terrible, but the resulting child is your sibling  irregardless and how they came to be isn\u2019t any fault of their own. They are not \u201cthe child\u201d they are your sibling. Her guilting your mom into feeling obligated to care for your sibling though, also not cool.", "NTA. You and your mother made the decision that you would not care for the child. Your sister is angry because she assumed that she'd be able to get *someone* to help her, but she can't. I don't envy her position at all, she's essentially a single mom at 19. And I feel bad for the kid, who needs stability and safety and unconditional love. But she doesn't get to decide right from wrong for you and your mother. And she certainly doesn't get to manipulate your mother into caring for the living representation of your father's betrayal.\n\nIt's honestly in the kid's best interest that you and your mom don't care for her. Kids are perceptive, they know when they aren't liked or wanted. And she absolutely doesn't need that right now.\n\nAnyone who plays the \"if you love me you'd...\" card is almost always a shameless manipulator and therefore the AH.", "NTA.  Younger sister made her choice.

Which is a shame for everyone. NTA", "NTA, that child is not your responsibility nor your mother's. Your sister made a rash decision & now realizes she can't do it by herself & tried making your mother do something that would make your mother extremely uncomfortable.", "NTA.   Your sister has no idea the hurt your mom must feel for being cheated on, lied to, wondering what she did wrong, etc., all the things that she had to experience as a result of your dad being a cheater.   \n\nYou are doing that child a favor by encouraging mom to stand up for what she feels.  If she hates the idea of that child, the kid will know.  They will feel the resentment, and will grow up feeling unimportant.  Sister wants help, but that help needs to be in the form of a loving community, not people that wish they were doing anything else.  She won't want to understand that but it is the truth.\n\nAnd of course, mom can always change her mind if she wants.  But for right now, if she doesn't want the kid, it is selfish of your sister to push her agenda.", "NTA. This such a terrible situation and it has put you all in a hard spot. Your sister is an AH for asking your mom to do something that would be so painful for her, but I recognize the hard spot she's in. It's not easy to be 19, dealing with the death of your father, and then trying to take on the care of a small child. It does sound like more than she can handle, but it's not up to your mom to fix this situation, or you. I think sis could use some therapy to deal with all of this, in addition to a whole lot of childcare. This is a radical shift in her life, and she has to figure out if she can handle it -- it IS a little insane that they (child services) let a 19 year take this one, while apparently offering no support.", "NTA\n\n  It should not be on your mother, the one who was CHEATED on, to be watching the child of of the affair relationship. It is mind boggling to me that your sister had the balls to ask her. Not only ask her but to try to GUILT TRIP her into doing it. Your sister is the major ah for that. You and your mom staying away is probably the best thing you can do rather than force yourselves to take care of a child you have resentment for. That little girl doesnt need to be exposed to that. \n\n   Your sister should not have taken custody of a child that she cannot afford take care of  and im very surprised she passed all the checks. And why is she not asking the childs biofamily that you mentioned for help? They didnt take her in but didnt they have a relationship with the little girl? Couldnt they help watch her sometimes? \n\n  The only ahs here are your sister and dad and his new wife. Not only for the affair but for not having a plan/will written out for who would take care of their young child if something happened to the both of them.", "NTA. It is absolutely horrible what has happened to that baby, but your mom should not sign up for the pain of taking care of the child of two people who hurt her immensely. Your sister was way out of line with the \u201cif you love me you will\u2026\u201d. That is narcissistic. You are looking out for your mom. You have no obligation to put this 2 year old above your mothers well being. I think you made the right choice as I do not think your mother should be put through years worth of pain.", "Esh.\n\nYour dad and his affair partner are obvious assholes.\n\nYou for how you refer to \"the child\". You are referring to your half sibling whether you like it or not. You don't have to have a relationship with her if you don't want to. And you don't have to help your sister raise her. But you do need to recognize that she is an innocent little girl.\n\nYour sister for trying to pressure your mother to take care of her husband and his affair partner's child. There is no way that way in any way fair to your mother. Not was she right to be angry at you for telling your mom to make herself happy.", "NTA. And honestly, I am surprised CPA gave your sister custody considering she is 19, basically a kid herself. Not blaming your mother in the slightest for not wanting to do anything with the affair child of her ex husband. Your sister is the one to blame for taking on a kid she wasn't financially ready for.", "NTA. You saved your mother a lot of heartache and resentment. You did do the right thing. Your sister agreed to raise the child knowing how the rest of the family felt about her dad and his new family, so she can figure out how to care for her.\n\nA child should not be with people who resent her presence. Your sister needs to come to grips with that fact and understand that it would not be healthy in the long run.", "Poor kid", "NTA. Younger sister had no idea what she was getting into.

I understand your resentment towards your father but the child is not responsible for that. If you don't want to be involved, that's your choice, but you could at least have a little compassion.", "YTA - That\u2019s your blood and the end result of your advice is putting a 2 year old into a very unforgiving system. \nBetter advice would be to tell you mom to not do anything she couldn\u2019t take on and maintain her own mental health, but if that means not stepping up, do work to find ways to provide the necessary support.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say ESH, except possibly mom.\n\nOP, I've read your comment that you don't feel you've convinced your mother of anything and if that were true then why did you feel the need to \"play dumb\" when your sister asked? You yourself say that you \"told her she shouldn't do it.\" Now, it's understandable you have some resentment here but you seem disappointed that your sister doesn't share it. Your disappoint was with your father not this child who is NOT your dad's \"affair child\" per your post and the fact that you've worded it that way is telling about your mindset. You're not the AH for not wanting to be involved, that's valid but you shouldn't be actively working against this child's well-being either not everyone has to share your feelings.\n\nYour sister seems to be trying to make the best of this but I also agree that care shouldn't fall to your mother, that's unfair to her but also a decision for **her alone** to make and care arrangements should have been a consideration before now. Your sister also probably should have chosen better words but from the little bit of information we have, you do sound kind of heartless about the whole situation so I can't disagree with that one.\n\nYour mother has no connection to this child right now. It's her ex-husband's second family. However, rather you are involved in her life or not, she will **always** be your and your sister's half-sister.", "NTA. Your mother would only have said yes had your sister succeeded in breaking her down with emotional blackmail. Good for you for being a sounding board for your mother and giving her the support she needed to stand up for herself. \n\nYour sister chose to take on the baby, that\u2019s on her. It\u2019s not for her to pressure anyone else into doing it as well, and in fact the child shouldn\u2019t be in the care of two people that don\u2019t want anything to do with her.

She didn't have to. Neither did you, so you're not NTA for refusing to be a parent.\n\nWhat makes me vote YTA is how you refer to your half-sister. She's a child. She has nothing to do with your resentment for a dead man. You're taking it out on her because your dad is dead and you can't take it out on him. Anyone that weaponizes children? They're assholes.\n\nYou're now using that resentment to poison every relationship that poor little girl, who is an orphan through no fault of her own, may ever have in her life.

Well, the sister's not gonna get any help. She's forced to step up and do it all herself. She's forced to grow up quick.

To me, she's a damned hero, saving a small child from the foster care system which, if this is the U.S., is horrific and could result in this little girl having no roots, living in group homes without love, and possible abuse.  Your sister has made great personal sacrifices to save this child, whom she sees as her little sister. \n\nWith complete understanding and acceptance of you not wanting to be involved, I do want to say that I think that the rage and hurt that should be directed at your A of a dad is very tied up in your feelings toward the child, who is the innocent victim here.\n\nAnd while it might (understandably!)  be too painful and infuriating to actually care for the little girl hands on, it would be a real kindness if you and your mom could afford to help your sister out financially.

While it isn't the child's fault, your mother will never be able to look at the child without seeing a living reminder of her no-good cheating husband.  Your mom needs to look out for herself too.", "Agreed.  Nothing more dangerous for a young child than to be in the care of someone who doesn't want to do it.  They're gonna have less self control with discipline and less patience in general.  I would say over time with middle sister taking care of baby sister the eldest sister and the older girls' mom will come around.  This all sounds like reactions to a new situation.", "Thank you! The younger sister is right, older sister is gonna have to explain to her half sister why she hated her so much she was willing to let her go to foster care.

I could probably make a post about how I skipped my taxes and they'd say NTA because the government was tryna force me to do something that made me sad.\n\nReally though, op and their mom need to reconcile with the fact that this is a two year old who is now the adopted daughter of their sister/daughter. Doesnt matter that genetically she's the product of a lousy ex husband and his mistress\u2014those people are dead and this kid wont even remember them.", "Yeah, holy shit.

What a bunch of heartless losers. \n\nThe list of \u201cheartless losers\u201d includes OP, OP\u2019s mother, every single person who wrote \u201cNTA\u201d, and every single person who upvoted \u201cNTA\u201d. \n\nYou should be ashamed of yourselves. You are beyond cruel, to want bad things to happen to an orphaned 2-year-old and the young woman who stepped up to take responsibility despite the sacrifices and challenges. \n\nIf you have ever been fortunate enough to have any adult figures in your life who cared for you as a child, why don\u2019t you go repeat some of the things you\u2019ve said here and see what they say? Really. Do it. Ask them what they would have wanted to happen to you if they had died when you were 2 years old.\n\nWhat would your mother think of the person you\u2019ve become? What would your grandmother think of you now? You people make me sick. \n\nI hope OP\u2019s sister is able to find the support she needs to make it through the difficult times, and breaks contact with her toxic, selfish, useless biological sister and mother. \n\nPlacing all their trauma onto a fucking innocent baby. How low of a person do you have to be to say that a child is undeserving of love and shouldn\u2019t be taken care of because of the decisions their parents made. \n\nThe baby is OP\u2019s half-sister, whether or not she wants to acknowledge it. Although from the way her post is written, I doubt she will ever care about anybody but herself. \n\nIf OP\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t want to babysit, there are other ways to help support her own daughter. But no, OP and her mother are too selfish to think of anything other than where to place blame for their lack of ability to deal with emotions. It\u2019s easier for them to wallow in self-pity and find a target for their hate. And a baby is the perfect target, because a baby can\u2019t fight back or stand up for itself.\n\nThis is one situation where I wish there was a way to contact the 19-year-old and try to help them navigate this difficult time. Put them in touch with local support systems and relevant parenting groups, raise money for childcare so that the adoptive parent/sister can finish university, just help out in some way, any way. \n\nArrange for open adoption even. Hell, I would open-adopt the kid into my own family in a heartbeat. The sister could visit anytime and take over parenting when/if she is ready. \n\nThe sister is the only one trying to do the right thing and make the best of a shitty situation. She is the only one stepping up and doing the right thing for the baby. The kid needs love, especially right now. And so does the sister.\n\nGo ahead and downvote me, you miserable, stone-hearted, toad-faced pricks. I\u2019ll consider it an honor to know that there is a difference between me and you. \n\nAnd if you die in a car accident and leave a confused, innocent, helpless baby behind, I hope they end up with someone who shows them love. And I hope that kid grows up to have more compassion than you do. \n\nSeriously, downvote this comment, just like you\u2019ve downvoted every comment that has said people should have a heart and do the right thing for a helpless orphaned baby and the young adult who cares enough to take her in. \n\nAnd then go out and live your sad, hollow, loveless lives, you heartless fucks.\n\nAnd then stop living your lives, so that people better than you can have more oxygen. \n\nThe world will be a better place without you. \n\nESH, including all you \u201cNTA\u201d asshole commenters and \u201cNTA\u201d asshole upvoters.

If you\u2019re so proud of yourself, why did you lie to your sister about that? I grant that your mom has no responsibilities here, but you, you won\u2019t help your sisters?? Bearing a grudge toward an orphaned baby!? After a tragedy? Yuck, OP, you\u2019re a monster.", "This! I'm so glad I finally found this comment after reading soooooo many NTA and YTA comments.\n\nHere's the thing-- the sister definitely was manipulative to her mom, and that makes her a gaping AH in this situation. But, I imagine she is flipping the hell out right now. She sounds like a mostly compassionate person who probably felt like she had no choice but to take the child in. OP said that her sister was the LAST RESORT before the kid went into the foster care system. We all well know that the foster care system in the US is a petri dish for neglect and abuse.\n\nAdditionally, it seems the sister had a standing relationship with the child and her father prior to the accident. So, not only are we dealing with the sister becoming a single mother at age 19 practically overnight and feeling like she had no choice but to put her dreams on hold, we are dealing with a 19 year old who is dealing with the trauma of suddenly losing a parent and the threat of potentially losing her 2 year old sister. Like, damn, I get that OP doesn't have a relationship with their dad or half sibling, but why are they seemingly incapable of realizing their sister is going through hell on multiple fronts?\n\nOP is not obligated to raise her cheating father's kid, and her mother certainly isn't, either. And the sister shouldn't have expected that of either of them-- that is also an AH move. But was it out of the question that the sister expected her family members to have a shred of empathy for her and support her in doing what she believes to be the right thing? No. I'm not surprised she panicked.\n\nOP, however, is not innocent in this. They admitted to flat-out lying to their sister and are acting all high and mighty in spite of that.  Additionally, the amount of vitriol they are showing towards their sister and the child due to their father's actions is frankly disgusting. I don't think OP is an awful person, but they clearly have a poisonous amount of anger and trauma festering that deeply, deeply needs to be addressed in therapy. For as much as they are making their sister out to be a stupid, naive kid, they also need to grow the hell up, have a little empathy, and ask themselves if their hatred is worth losing their sibling and acting like a literal child is a nuisance that doesn't deserve the love of their family.", "Biology doesn't always mean family. \n\nThe sister shouldn't have taken on said huge responsibility if she couldn't handle it alone.\n\nThe mother and OP owe this child nothing and do not deserve the emotional baggage from putting up with the child that reminds them of their family breaking down.", "He has no obligation to take care of the child of his father especially the child his father had with his mistress would you take your partners Affair child in?

It's like when people criticize someone for doing IVF or adopting outside the US.  My cousin was a foster parent and had 2 year old twins placed with her.  They wanted to adopt them but no they had to go back to the parents. Within two weeks they got a call in the middle of the night because the bio father had SA them AGAIN.  Our system makes it very difficult to adopt.  They did finally strip them parents of their rights and my cousin ended up adopting them and 4 other foster children.  They all have issues due to the years that they were in the system and what their own parents did to them.", "The *mom* is not a bio relative, and that's who the sister was trying to guilt into helping. \n\nIf the child stays with the sister, I do hope OP can eventually separate her dad's wrongdoing out and bond with her.

Don't believe it? Take a look at the THOUSANDS of American couples (and some singles) who adopt toddlers internationally because it's so difficult to adopt a healthy infant in the United States. Older kids and kids from abusive backgrounds, unfortunately, are not easy to place for adoption, but it's not that difficult to find adoptive parents for healthy toddlers.\n\nThe social worker should never have approved this 19-year-old as a placement for the child.

Last I heard,  he was homeless & trying to rebuild his life from destroying it with pisspoor decisions.\n\nAnd I'm resting in my 5bdrm house with the fan on medium.", "NTA. Thank goodness you\u2019re there to support your mother\u2019s emotional well-being.", "NTA - Your sister made her choice. Why would she think your mother would take care of the affair child? Has she not suffered enough in your father's hands? Even in death, the father is causing her trouble. She's the last person to take care of that child in this world. \n\nI'm sure the dad and his affair partner had many other relatives. They had the right to decline this child. The mother has the same right too.", "NTA. If you Mum \u2018hates\u2019 the idea of it, it would have ended up terrible for everyone involved. This is the best outcome for the child even if it feels awful right now.", "\"I thank God for OP's sister's softened heart \"\n\nThe sister has had a relationship with her father and the child since the beginning. She wasn't bothered by her father's treatment of her mother (or what her sister went through with their father). It's normal  that she cares for the child. OP never kept any contact/relationship with the father since he walked out on them.\nIt has nothing to do with compassion or whatever you are talking about. One cares for the people around them. OP never.met this child and never cared to. The sister has known the child and Affair partner and has had a relationship with them and her dad.", "OP doesn't owe this child her life. She has her own life to live.\n\nGood that the sister wanted the child. But that's a choice that should be freely made. Not forced on a person who had no part in creating the child.", "Actually, comments like yours make me realize that many people don't understand the concept of drawing and keeping reasonable boundaries when it comes to family. OP doesn't resent the child. She simply doesn't know her and doesn't want to because she is a constant reminder of her father's emotional abuse (and yes, constantly ditching your kid for sex with your girlfriend is a form of abuse and neglect however much you disgustingly try to downplay it). \n\nBottom line: OP and her mother are both allowed to decide they want nothing to do with this child. And the sister is being incredibly selfish taking this child in knowing that she can't do it instead of allowing her to (very likely given her young age) be adopted by a stable family who will give her everything she needs.", "Finally someone with a soul. Jeeeez the amount of hate for a child with no parents or home is unreal.", "Totally agree. YTA. This is what happens when we take the idea of \u201cboundaries\u201d so far to the conclusion that we just never have to do anything we don\u2019t want to do. I understand why and how boundaries are a real thing, but this sub does not. The mom, okay she was cheated on, but OP? Get over yourself. I also like the point about if we\u2019re all soooooo sure OP is right, why\u2019d she lie?", "you can also choose, what kinda human being YOU want to be. Why don't you take guardianship for the child. Why do you, so badly, want to tie the kid to the person who was cheated on? Why do the people, who were already used and disrespected have to take on the additional toll of a child who'll constantly remind them of the cheating.", "Agreed, can\u2019t believe how far I had to scroll to see these reasonable and empathetic comments.", "Exactly", "Well car accidents that kill people don't exactly run on a timeline. No one knew that this was going to happen.", ">ell, she should just keep on fighting then. Alone.\n\nHas there ever been a parent that could anticipate \"all of the challenges of taking in a child\"?  Even for natural parents, has one ever been able to anticipate all the challenges on their first child?  One their second?  Tenth?", "Every situation is different. Especially since we know the affair went on for a while and the father completely neglected his daughter. Nobody can tell them what they are feeling wrong. They have a right to not put themselves through emotional and mental torture. Nobody here can judge them negatively especially when we really don't know how OP's mother was treated on the daily while married.", "When you have a family and cheat the cheater is rejecting their entire family not just their partner. Because it\u2019s the whole family that will need to deal with the consequences of the cheater\u2019s actions. From there it\u2019s up to each individual person if the pain the cheater knowingly and willingly inflicted on them because they were horney is forgivable. This idea that kids should just ignore that their parents are cheaters is so bizarre", "Of course she did something wrong. She tried to guilt trip her mom and then became vicious against her sister who wanted nothing to do with their father because of the way she was treated and the way he treated their mother.", "Im sorry for you. You can tell here who has horrible families, or at least hates them. Its sad to me.", "\"doing everything in their power to make her suffer \"\n\n... Wth. What are they doing that is harming the child exactly???? \nYou are extremely self righteous", "exactly. It's amazing how many times I've seen this situation on reddit."]}
