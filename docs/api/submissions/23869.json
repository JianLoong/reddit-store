She lost that baby. They ended up getting married and 2 years ago had a child together who I never met. A few months ago they both died in a car crash that claimed five people's lives. A social worker contacted me and my sister to see if one of us would take her in. We were left until last because they wanted older bio relatives first, but none of them wanted her. My sister asked if we could raise her together. I said I was not getting involved and told the social worker I would not raise her. My sister, who is only 19, stepped up. There were some things that needed to happen first. She dropped out of her college classes (she was working during the day and going to college at night) and she needed to move into a two bedroom place instead of the one bedroom she was in. She also needed to get some background check done.\n\nBut she passed, she has the child. Now she's having a hard time with child care. She knew I wouldn't say yes so she asked our mom.

So she called me, told me she didn't want to do it, that she HATES the thought of having that child in her home and caring for her. But she knows it will ruin her relationship with my sister if she doesn't. I told her she shouldn't do it. That she would not be a good fit for one, but she would also be miserable and while my sister might not hate her, she could end up resenting them both. She agreed with me and told my sister she would not watch her.\n\nMy sister called and asked if I had anything to do with it. I played dumb and said I didn't know what she meant. She said she knew that was a lie because mom was so close to doing the right thing and suddenly she's firmly no. She called me a cunt, a bitch, said I was heartless, that one day she'll tell \"our little sister\" everything and will make me face up to my rejection of her and my lack of care for her. I told her I owe the child nothing and I would not apologize for telling mom to do what she wants. My sister then said I was cold hearted and cruel and I don't seem to care about her either. I told her I cannot pretend to give a fuck about the child dad created with his affair partner and that she would rather me stay away.

She is two years old, newly orphaned, and your half-sister. You don't have to be involved in her life if you really don't want to be, but the degree to which you openly don't care about her welfare, and to which you resent her for what your dad did, is just horrible. Your sister is wrong to lash out at you for her difficulties in finding childcare - she took on this responsibility willingly, so this is on her - but she's a better person than you are. I hope things work out for them.", "NTA.  That child is from an affair so your mom doesn't have to take care of said child.", "NTA - You and your mother effectively want no relationship to half sister. Younger sister made her bed by taking guardianship of half sister, now she needs to deal with it by herself", "NTA\n\nNot everyone likes kids, not everyone is okay watching them. It shouldn't be expected of you to watch and babysit. Your sister also needs to understand things like this take time. Barely know her and your sister is asking you to watch her weeks in? Intrusive, rude, no right to lash out or be angry.\n\nI will say however, it's fantastic that your sister took her in and she's being kept with family. And please just keep this in mind...your little sister is not your dad, she has done NOTHING wrong. Both her parents are dead, her life is upside down, she asked for none of this. \n\nYou can't change the bad past, but you can absolutely create something great with your little sister moving forward. I hope this little girl grows up to be happy and content with life, if you can contribute in some way towards that, at least think about it.", "NTA.. I feel for that child but omg this is not on you. And your 19 yo sister ruining her future to take care of this child.. without any support", "Nope, NTA x1000\n\nYour half sister is nothing to your mom, except the living representation of your father's lies and betrayal. Nothing good would come of the 3 of them together.\n\nYour mother did NOT want to help with the kid, your sister just banked on guilt tripping her and heard what she wanted to hear. You just told your mom it was okay to stands up to emotional blackmail, and draw clear boundaries.\n\nToo bad your sister is impulsive and not willing to play the long game. She could have done what she wanted to do, and not alienated both of you.\n\nThere was a work around here, she was just unwilling to compromise.\n\nSorry you and your mom are being treated this way. Peace.", "Being related to someone doesnt make you obligated to them. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You gave your mom support in her choice. You didn't force her to make that choice. Also, your half-sister would be able to pick up on it if your mom resented her. Kids aren't stupid. It's best for your sister to not be around people who will have negative feelings towards her. She and your mom are both innocent parties who are struggling enough. Your mom being pushed into caring for her will only hurt them both more.", "NTA.\n\nUltimately, your mother made the decision herself. This isn't her child and she expressed to you that she didn't want to help care for this little girl. Your sister chose to take on this responsibility, so she's gonna have to figure it out just like any other parent/guardian.", "ESH but your 2 sisters. First, that was NOT an affair child. She was born from your father\u2019s second marriage. I\u2019m sorry that the resentment that you and your mother feel for your father has trickledown to an innocent child who has no one in her life but your other sister. I do agree that if you both hate her so much just for being born you should not take care of her. Go to therapy and maybe one day if it\u2019s not too late you might find in your heart to rebuild a relationship if not with her with your other sister. If you can\u2019t find in your heart to let go of the past, please stay away from her as you do since you will only poison her with your hate and shame her for something she has no fault at all.", "NTA. I was going to say N A H until your sister called you a heartless bitch for not helping. Your dad hurt you all badly with this affair and it's hardly unreasonable that you and your mom don't want to take care of the child. Your sister has a huge heart and put the welfare of the child above her feelings - but apparently without really understanding what she was getting into. But she's not accepting that you aren't able to do the same thing. \n\nIt would be lovely if you could eventually accept the child, since she's now essentially your sister's child, and the guy who caused all the pain is gone now.", "ESH. Your dad had an affair on your mother and that\u2019s terrible, but the resulting child is your sibling  irregardless and how they came to be isn\u2019t any fault of their own. They are not \u201cthe child\u201d they are your sibling. Her guilting your mom into feeling obligated to care for your sibling though, also not cool.", "NTA. You and your mother made the decision that you would not care for the child. Your sister is angry because she assumed that she'd be able to get *someone* to help her, but she can't. I don't envy her position at all, she's essentially a single mom at 19. And I feel bad for the kid, who needs stability and safety and unconditional love. But she doesn't get to decide right from wrong for you and your mother. And she certainly doesn't get to manipulate your mother into caring for the living representation of your father's betrayal.\n\nIt's honestly in the kid's best interest that you and your mom don't care for her. Kids are perceptive, they know when they aren't liked or wanted. And she absolutely doesn't need that right now.\n\nAnyone who plays the \"if you love me you'd...\" card is almost always a shameless manipulator and therefore the AH.", "NTA.  Younger sister made her choice.

Which is a shame for everyone. NTA", "NTA, that child is not your responsibility nor your mother's. Your sister made a rash decision & now realizes she can't do it by herself & tried making your mother do something that would make your mother extremely uncomfortable.", "NTA.   Your sister has no idea the hurt your mom must feel for being cheated on, lied to, wondering what she did wrong, etc., all the things that she had to experience as a result of your dad being a cheater.   \n\nYou are doing that child a favor by encouraging mom to stand up for what she feels.  If she hates the idea of that child, the kid will know.  They will feel the resentment, and will grow up feeling unimportant.  Sister wants help, but that help needs to be in the form of a loving community, not people that wish they were doing anything else.  She won't want to understand that but it is the truth.\n\nAnd of course, mom can always change her mind if she wants.  But for right now, if she doesn't want the kid, it is selfish of your sister to push her agenda.", "NTA. This such a terrible situation and it has put you all in a hard spot. Your sister is an AH for asking your mom to do something that would be so painful for her, but I recognize the hard spot she's in. It's not easy to be 19, dealing with the death of your father, and then trying to take on the care of a small child. It does sound like more than she can handle, but it's not up to your mom to fix this situation, or you. I think sis could use some therapy to deal with all of this, in addition to a whole lot of childcare. This is a radical shift in her life, and she has to figure out if she can handle it -- it IS a little insane that they (child services) let a 19 year take this one, while apparently offering no support.", "NTA\n\n  It should not be on your mother, the one who was CHEATED on, to be watching the child of of the affair relationship. It is mind boggling to me that your sister had the balls to ask her. Not only ask her but to try to GUILT TRIP her into doing it. Your sister is the major ah for that. You and your mom staying away is probably the best thing you can do rather than force yourselves to take care of a child you have resentment for. That little girl doesnt need to be exposed to that. \n\n   Your sister should not have taken custody of a child that she cannot afford take care of  and im very surprised she passed all the checks. And why is she not asking the childs biofamily that you mentioned for help? They didnt take her in but didnt they have a relationship with the little girl? Couldnt they help watch her sometimes? \n\n  The only ahs here are your sister and dad and his new wife.

It is absolutely horrible what has happened to that baby, but your mom should not sign up for the pain of taking care of the child of two people who hurt her immensely. Your sister was way out of line with the \u201cif you love me you will\u2026\u201d. That is narcissistic. You are looking out for your mom. You have no obligation to put this 2 year old above your mothers well being. I think you made the right choice as I do not think your mother should be put through years worth of pain.", "Esh.\n\nYour dad and his affair partner are obvious assholes.\n\nYou for how you refer to \"the child\". You are referring to your half sibling whether you like it or not. You don't have to have a relationship with her if you don't want to. And you don't have to help your sister raise her. But you do need to recognize that she is an innocent little girl.\n\nYour sister for trying to pressure your mother to take care of her husband and his affair partner's child. There is no way that way in any way fair to your mother. Not was she right to be angry at you for telling your mom to make herself happy.", "NTA. And honestly, I am surprised CPA gave your sister custody considering she is 19, basically a kid herself. Not blaming your mother in the slightest for not wanting to do anything with the affair child of her ex husband. Your sister is the one to blame for taking on a kid she wasn't financially ready for.", "NTA. You saved your mother a lot of heartache and resentment. You did do the right thing. Your sister agreed to raise the child knowing how the rest of the family felt about her dad and his new family, so she can figure out how to care for her.\n\nA child should not be with people who resent her presence. Your sister needs to come to grips with that fact and understand that it would not be healthy in the long run.", "Poor kid", "NTA. Younger sister had no idea what she was getting into.

I understand your resentment towards your father but the child is not responsible for that. If you don't want to be involved, that's your choice, but you could at least have a little compassion.", "YTA - That\u2019s your blood and the end result of your advice is putting a 2 year old into a very unforgiving system. \nBetter advice would be to tell you mom to not do anything she couldn\u2019t take on and maintain her own mental health, but if that means not stepping up, do work to find ways to provide the necessary support.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say ESH, except possibly mom.\n\nOP, I've read your comment that you don't feel you've convinced your mother of anything and if that were true then why did you feel the need to \"play dumb\" when your sister asked? You yourself say that you \"told her she shouldn't do it.\" Now, it's understandable you have some resentment here but you seem disappointed that your sister doesn't share it. Your disappoint was with your father not this child who is NOT your dad's \"affair child\" per your post and the fact that you've worded it that way is telling about your mindset. You're not the AH for not wanting to be involved, that's valid but you shouldn't be actively working against this child's well-being either not everyone has to share your feelings.\n\nYour sister seems to be trying to make the best of this but I also agree that care shouldn't fall to your mother, that's unfair to her but also a decision for **her alone** to make and care arrangements should have been a consideration before now. Your sister also probably should have chosen better words but from the little bit of information we have, you do sound kind of heartless about the whole situation so I can't disagree with that one.\n\nYour mother has no connection to this child right now. It's her ex-husband's second family. However, rather you are involved in her life or not, she will **always** be your and your sister's half-sister.", "NTA. Your mother would only have said yes had your sister succeeded in breaking her down with emotional blackmail. Good for you for being a sounding board for your mother and giving her the support she needed to stand up for herself. \n\nYour sister chose to take on the baby, that\u2019s on her. It\u2019s not for her to pressure anyone else into doing it as well, and in fact the child shouldn\u2019t be in the care of two people that don\u2019t want anything to do with her.

She didn't have to. Neither did you, so you're not NTA for refusing to be a parent.\n\nWhat makes me vote YTA is how you refer to your half-sister. She's a child. She has nothing to do with your resentment for a dead man. You're taking it out on her because your dad is dead and you can't take it out on him. Anyone that weaponizes children? They're assholes.\n\nYou're now using that resentment to poison every relationship that poor little girl, who is an orphan through no fault of her own, may ever have in her life.
