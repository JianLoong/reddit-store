When you do, it allows EVERYONE to give their input, and it's usually not positive. So when you announce the name after baby has arrived and it is officially their name, what is everyone's response? \"aw.....that's so cute.\"\n\nAs first time expecting parents we made the mistake of telling the name to people. Oh my hell! A deluge of thoughts and suggestions. People really want to take credit for naming a baby it would seem. Just don't do it.", "ESH. You were both out of line insulting names that are meaningful to the other. That being said, she can\u2019t name your baby. The end. Stop letting them have even the vaguest impression that they get to pick the name for the child you and your husband are having. I also recommend NOT discussing your possible names before the birth certificate is signed. Listen to ideas from others, say nothing except \u201cthank you.\u201d", "ESH.  Your MIL should only be getting input into the baby\u2019s name if both you and your partner agreed on it.  She sure as hell shouldn\u2019t be trying to tell you what you will name the baby.\n\nYou went deeply, unnecessarily rude when it came to telling her that you didn\u2019t like the name.\n\nIt sounds like both you and your husband are trying to make unilateral decisions about what to call your child, instead of working together and compromising.\n\nI strongly recommend against giving your child a video game name, btw - she\u2019s going to struggle with people misspelling and mispronouncing her name all her life, and studies suggest that odd names like that are harmful to things like getting a job and advancing in a career.  Why not make it her middle name?  Then she\u2019s not saddled with the disadvantages of an unusual name as her first name, but she\u2019ll still carry it, since it\u2019s important to you.", "The one thing you should never do is discuss your baby's name because everyone will have an opinion. Just wait until it's born, and then everyone will be happy and no one will say anything about the baby's name because...well, the deed is done.\n\nShe was unkind to you regarding your choice of a name, but you did not have to say that about a name chosen to honor her mother.

I have one of those and it\u2019s annoying as fuck", "ESH - it's possible to disagree without descending to insults. But on another note, PLEASE don't name your daughter Aerith. Unusual names are all very well and good, but she's going to spend her whole life spelling her name when people hear it and having it mispronounced when people see it. She's not likely to thank you for that, particularly as she won't have the connection to the source that you do. If you absolutely must do it, then I strongly urge you to make Aerith a middle name.", "ESH. MIL doesn't get a say but calling the name hideous was too much. That being said, your husband DOES get a say and he seems to be against the name you want so the two of you need a name together. \n\nAnd please don't name your kid after a video game. All you are doing is setting up a future name change hearing that you will be upset about. If you must use Aerith, use it as a middle name. You are having a child who will one day be an adult and very few adults want to explain to a million strangers that their mother named them after a video game.", "ESH. You don\u2019t get to pick your child\u2018s name unilaterally. Your MIL certainly doesn\u2019t get to pick. She can ask. She can say that it would mean a lot to her if you (plural) named your (plural) daughter after her mother. Then she can live with whatever you (plural) choose. Your husband can, in private, advocate for naming your (plural) daughter after his grandmother, but should be telling his mother that she doesn\u2019t get to dictate this decision and the child\u2019s parents will be choosing the child\u2019s name.  And then the two of you can choose a name for your (plural) daughter TOGETHER.\n\nAerith? No one is EVER going to spell or pronounce that correctly. How about something somewhere in between your MIL\u2018s suggestion of a normal name that sounds hopelessly 1956 and your suggestion of a name that may very likely lead to your poor daughter having to have endless conversations in which she rolls her eyes and says with tolerant exasperation, \u201cYes, my mother named me after some video game character from like 2015.\u201d\n\nI have no idea what your and your husband\u2019s relative economic backgrounds have to do with any of this.", "ESH you're all being petty af. Your child has to live with the name you give them.

Hopefully it will be out of style again by the time she's old enough to get a job or that's going to suck.", "ESH - you\u2019re right, your MILs name pick is hideous, but you shouldn\u2019t have said that. I hope you reconsider your name choice though, as she will have to spell it to everyone - everywhere - for the whole of her life!!", "I'm torn between a N T A and an E S H.\n\nMil has absolutely no business \"announcing' your baby's name. Those are not news for her to give. Besides, if she wants a kid named after her mother, she can have one herself. \n\nYou calling the name hideous is hurtful to her and disrespectful to your husband's family. You basically told them \"your relative's name is hideous\" That's not a very nice thing to say.\n\nYou could have certainly handled the situation a bit better by omitting the \"hideous\" adjective. Also, talking about you growing up rich adds absolutely no substance to your argument. You just wanted everyone here to now you're rich.\n\nI'm going to go with YTA.", "ESH. Both of you are unnecessarily rude about the name choices. Normally I'd say anyone who wasn't part of the conception doesn't get a say in the naming, but this time I'll ask you to reconsider. Yes, Aerith sounds beautiful, but is it really an ideal name for her? It will be mispronounced, misspelled, and impossible to find on anything that isn't customized. Would you consider Aerith (no Aeris, huh?) as a middle name? \n\n[Side note- my cat was a puffy blonde kitten , so while we searched for a name we chose him to be Cloud (Strife). He kept that as a middle name. ]", "ESH.  Your MIL is overstepping, but you're not going to improve your relationship with her by slinging insults.  Talk to your husband and decide on the name together.  I'm not sure many kids would want to grow up knowing they were named after a video game character, and if you don't like Cheryl, don't name the kid Cheryl.  But together with your husband, agree on the name and announce that.", "INFO Did you know that the name was referrencing MIL's mother before disparaging the name?", "ESH. Sure shouldn't be trying to name your child. You shouldn't be calling her choice hideous. You could have just said no, we're not actually calling her that, and left it there.", "ESH. Your MIL has no business picking your child's name (regardless of how nice or hideous it is).  You were also an AH for being rude about it. Also, while I get it that you pick the name Aerith for a reason, PLEASE don't.  Good or bad, its not common, so your kid will have to spell it out forever.  Not fun for your kid at all.  Please choose something like Erica or Jason or something more known.", "Yeah you suck for saying that about your husbands GRANDMOTHER, very disrespectful, you could have said something a lot nicer while rejecting the name.\n\nYour MIL and husband suck for unilaterally deciding on a name.\n\nYou and your husband suck for not being able to come to a reasonable decision together.\n\nIf you seriously want to keep Aerith, maybe consider her alternate name Aeris, might be more acceptable.  Either way this should be your and your husband's decision and not anyone else's.\n\nEDIT: reading other people's responses, yeah don't name your child Aerith or Aeris.  Give her a normal name.  If you really want it use it as a middle name.  (mind you I have a middle name - a normal one even - and middle names are a pain in the backside.", "I'm going with NTA on this because I don't believe anyone else should have a say in the baby name except your spouse.

Though at the end of the day, your choice.\n\nP.S. Just a thought but since I believe Aerith was originally named partially because it\u2019s close to an anagram of \u201cEarth\u201d, so maybe another name that means Earth would be a way to carry the meaning with you but not inherently impose a connection that your child may struggle with.", "If you feel like compromising, Cherith is a nice name.", "ESH.
