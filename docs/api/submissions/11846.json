When you do, it allows EVERYONE to give their input, and it's usually not positive. So when you announce the name after baby has arrived and it is officially their name, what is everyone's response? \"aw.....that's so cute.\"\n\nAs first time expecting parents we made the mistake of telling the name to people. Oh my hell! A deluge of thoughts and suggestions. People really want to take credit for naming a baby it would seem. Just don't do it.", "ESH. You were both out of line insulting names that are meaningful to the other. That being said, she can\u2019t name your baby. The end. Stop letting them have even the vaguest impression that they get to pick the name for the child you and your husband are having. I also recommend NOT discussing your possible names before the birth certificate is signed. Listen to ideas from others, say nothing except \u201cthank you.\u201d", "ESH.  Your MIL should only be getting input into the baby\u2019s name if both you and your partner agreed on it.  She sure as hell shouldn\u2019t be trying to tell you what you will name the baby.\n\nYou went deeply, unnecessarily rude when it came to telling her that you didn\u2019t like the name.\n\nIt sounds like both you and your husband are trying to make unilateral decisions about what to call your child, instead of working together and compromising.\n\nI strongly recommend against giving your child a video game name, btw - she\u2019s going to struggle with people misspelling and mispronouncing her name all her life, and studies suggest that odd names like that are harmful to things like getting a job and advancing in a career.  Why not make it her middle name?  Then she\u2019s not saddled with the disadvantages of an unusual name as her first name, but she\u2019ll still carry it, since it\u2019s important to you.", "The one thing you should never do is discuss your baby's name because everyone will have an opinion. Just wait until it's born, and then everyone will be happy and no one will say anything about the baby's name because...well, the deed is done.\n\nShe was unkind to you regarding your choice of a name, but you did not have to say that about a name chosen to honor her mother.

I have one of those and it\u2019s annoying as fuck", "ESH - it's possible to disagree without descending to insults. But on another note, PLEASE don't name your daughter Aerith. Unusual names are all very well and good, but she's going to spend her whole life spelling her name when people hear it and having it mispronounced when people see it. She's not likely to thank you for that, particularly as she won't have the connection to the source that you do. If you absolutely must do it, then I strongly urge you to make Aerith a middle name.", "ESH. MIL doesn't get a say but calling the name hideous was too much. That being said, your husband DOES get a say and he seems to be against the name you want so the two of you need a name together. \n\nAnd please don't name your kid after a video game. All you are doing is setting up a future name change hearing that you will be upset about. If you must use Aerith, use it as a middle name. You are having a child who will one day be an adult and very few adults want to explain to a million strangers that their mother named them after a video game.", "ESH. You don\u2019t get to pick your child\u2018s name unilaterally. Your MIL certainly doesn\u2019t get to pick. She can ask. She can say that it would mean a lot to her if you (plural) named your (plural) daughter after her mother. Then she can live with whatever you (plural) choose. Your husband can, in private, advocate for naming your (plural) daughter after his grandmother, but should be telling his mother that she doesn\u2019t get to dictate this decision and the child\u2019s parents will be choosing the child\u2019s name.  And then the two of you can choose a name for your (plural) daughter TOGETHER.\n\nAerith? No one is EVER going to spell or pronounce that correctly. How about something somewhere in between your MIL\u2018s suggestion of a normal name that sounds hopelessly 1956 and your suggestion of a name that may very likely lead to your poor daughter having to have endless conversations in which she rolls her eyes and says with tolerant exasperation, \u201cYes, my mother named me after some video game character from like 2015.\u201d\n\nI have no idea what your and your husband\u2019s relative economic backgrounds have to do with any of this.", "ESH you're all being petty af.

Hopefully it will be out of style again by the time she's old enough to get a job or that's going to suck.", "ESH - you\u2019re right, your MILs name pick is hideous, but you shouldn\u2019t have said that.

Those are not news for her to give. Besides, if she wants a kid named after her mother, she can have one herself. \n\nYou calling the name hideous is hurtful to her and disrespectful to your husband's family. You basically told them \"your relative's name is hideous\" That's not a very nice thing to say.\n\nYou could have certainly handled the situation a bit better by omitting the \"hideous\" adjective. Also, talking about you growing up rich adds absolutely no substance to your argument. You just wanted everyone here to now you're rich.\n\nI'm going to go with YTA.", "ESH. Both of you are unnecessarily rude about the name choices. Normally I'd say anyone who wasn't part of the conception doesn't get a say in the naming, but this time I'll ask you to reconsider. Yes, Aerith sounds beautiful, but is it really an ideal name for her? It will be mispronounced, misspelled, and impossible to find on anything that isn't customized. Would you consider Aerith (no Aeris, huh?) as a middle name? \n\n[Side note- my cat was a puffy blonde kitten , so while we searched for a name we chose him to be Cloud (Strife). He kept that as a middle name. ]", "ESH.  Your MIL is overstepping, but you're not going to improve your relationship with her by slinging insults.  Talk to your husband and decide on the name together.  I'm not sure many kids would want to grow up knowing they were named after a video game character, and if you don't like Cheryl, don't name the kid Cheryl.  But together with your husband, agree on the name and announce that.", "INFO Did you know that the name was referrencing MIL's mother before disparaging the name?", "ESH. Sure shouldn't be trying to name your child. You shouldn't be calling her choice hideous. You could have just said no, we're not actually calling her that, and left it there.", "ESH. Your MIL has no business picking your child's name (regardless of how nice or hideous it is).  You were also an AH for being rude about it. Also, while I get it that you pick the name Aerith for a reason, PLEASE don't.  Good or bad, its not common, so your kid will have to spell it out forever.  Not fun for your kid at all.  Please choose something like Erica or Jason or something more known.", "Yeah you suck for saying that about your husbands GRANDMOTHER, very disrespectful, you could have said something a lot nicer while rejecting the name.\n\nYour MIL and husband suck for unilaterally deciding on a name.\n\nYou and your husband suck for not being able to come to a reasonable decision together.\n\nIf you seriously want to keep Aerith, maybe consider her alternate name Aeris, might be more acceptable.  Either way this should be your and your husband's decision and not anyone else's.\n\nEDIT: reading other people's responses, yeah don't name your child Aerith or Aeris.  Give her a normal name.  If you really want it use it as a middle name.  (mind you I have a middle name - a normal one even - and middle names are a pain in the backside.", "I'm going with NTA on this because I don't believe anyone else should have a say in the baby name except your spouse.

Though at the end of the day, your choice.\n\nP.S. Just a thought but since I believe Aerith was originally named partially because it\u2019s close to an anagram of \u201cEarth\u201d, so maybe another name that means Earth would be a way to carry the meaning with you but not inherently impose a connection that your child may struggle with.", "If you feel like compromising, Cherith is a nice name.", "ESH.

My son's MIL often just takes the kids and has their haircut without asking.  His youngest son had beautiful blonde soft curls in his hair at 2 and they weren't ready to part with them yet but she got tired of his hair in his eyes and took him for his first haircut without telling anyone.  The gall of these people just amazes me.  My husband and I compromised and came up with names together.  You are both being a little self-centered about the name though.  You have to agree on the name.  You can't either of you just say \"this is the name. Period!\". Work together or what's the point.  Do you want to be happy or right?  In this case, do you want a happy marriage or your pick used.  Pick your priorities.", "Both names are dreadful but you're NTA - all your MIL needs to know is that she doesn't get a vote.", "ESH Cheryl is a pretty common name. Not bad at all really. \nDo not name your kid after a character. That's setting them up to be bullied.  Get a dog and name it after the character.  Come up with a name both you and your husband like and then do not share it until the kid is already born.", "NTA.

I think a better way to handle it would be to thank MIL for her suggestion and let her know that we would give that name some consideration, but will make our decision at a later date.  That said, I am not sure how things work in the state you live in, but I have to tell you what happened to me.  In Massachusetts the father can fill out the paperwork if you are legally married. SO....while I was still knocked out from anesthesia (i had a c-section) my husband filled out the birth certificate. WE had not yet picked a first name, just agreed on a middle name.  Yup, I had NO SAY in our first child's name.  A day or two later I asked about filling out the birth certificate paperwork and they sent the birth registrar into my room. She let me know the paperwork had already been done and filed.  I asked, Oh...and just what is my son's name because I HAVEN'T PICKED IT YET!  She was a bit panicked to say the least and let me know that my husband had filled out and signed the paperwork which is totally legal in Massachusetts.   Not thrilled. So anyway...just make sure you and DH are on the same page as far as names go and maybe make sure that the birth certificate paperwork is in YOUR possession and not where DH or MIL can get to it before you.

If that continues, then I would talk to your husband about going LC or even NC with her", "No, you are not .  MIL had her children and had her chance to name them.  This is your time for you and  your husband to choose a name together, not influenced by others.  Otherwise , you could always put MIL's suggestion as a middle name(which usually only close family knows).

Whilst the name your MIL chose isnt great, I have to confess yours isn't great either. Do you really want to saddle your child a lifetime of having to tell people how to pronounce her name? Also it really does bother kids never being able to find merch without their names when they go into gift shops. I can't even begin to work out how you pronounce Aerith?", "NTA. It\u2019s your daughter not your MILs you get to chose the name not her. If she has a problem with it then she can have another kid and name them Cheryl.", "NTA- your MIL needs to learn boundaries. She named her children. It is up to you and your spouse to decide the name you\u2019d like. When I was pregnant, my own MIL went through our baby name book and underlined all the names she liked. I reminded her that she had her own children, picked their names and that my husband and I will choose our child\u2019s name. At first she wasn\u2019t pleased with the name, made racist comments about it, showing her true character.

No wonder she was hurt but it was very presumptuous of her to think she was going to get a choice in your baby's name in the first place.", "I thought it was normal to keep the baby name a secret until it's named, because that's the Jewish tradition.   Growing up in a Jewish community that's just how it was. \n\nIt wasn't till I was older that I found out its just a Jewish thing.

You\u2019re right, people put their opinions aside quickly once the kiddo is born because they\u2019re just happy to meet them! \n\nIt astounds me to this day on how people make irrelevant things like naming a child about them. My friend who chose not to announce the sex or name of her child until after she gave birth was bombarded by family members hounding her about the name. I hosted the shower and a lot of them also reached out to ask about the name so they can send my friend a personalized embroidered gift to open at the shower\u2026when i just heard my friend tell them over the phone that she wouldn\u2019t be announcing the name in time for the shower and if a name gift was important they were free to send one after she gives birth.\n\nSome people just want to know for the sake of knowing or so they can talk shit.

The joke being that it was such an odd name. Likewise, Eliot seems to be getting popular for baby girls, inspired by a TV character who had that name because her father wanted her to be a boy. And again, the joke was that it was such an inappropriate name for a girl. So yeah, sometimes your \u201cout there\u201d name is going to eventually become common; maybe even overused.
