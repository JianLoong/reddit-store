She's a paid cleaner, complaining that whoever is paying her to clean, isn't cleaning themselves? \n\nYeah, no.", "NTA. My sister cleaned houses for years and that was what she was paid to do. The dusting, scrubbing, toilets, tubs, sinks, mop, etc. She didn't deal with the families' personal effects (always had a system set up where personal items, if found, were placed in a laundry basket she would take from place to place.)\n\nKindly remind her her job is to clean what her client wants her to clean, not critique their parenting skills.", "NAh \n\nMaybe your sister was naive about what the duties entailed.   If she worked 2 days x week, 8 hours/day (16 hours /week) she's making $15.63/hour.  Not sure if shes getting taxed or if its more of a cash under the table situation, but now that she better understands what her employer expects, she can decide if that's a fair wage or if she would rather find another job soing something else.\n\nIn any case, its probably a valuable learning experience for her with her next job interview, to ask more questions about what she would be willing to do for the money offered.  As she gains more experience, she can start to ask better questions in the interview process, as well as negotiate - example maybe she's willing to do the work asked, but would want $20/hour.", "NTA although as a learning experience, it is sometimes better not to attempt to reason logically with someone who is as clearly delusional on the topic as your sister.\n\nI am in a high cost of living area and $125 to clean a home is considered a decent amount. Even if all of those tasks could NOT be done in less than 8 hours it is a normal wage for a house cleaner.  There is no mention of changing bed linen, doing the laundry or ironing - and those are time consuming so I assume not done twice a week at every visit. Nor is there mention of very time consuming stuff like washing down the interior of the refrigerator which is generally not done every week. It doesn\u2019t take 8 hours of work to clean a house.\n\nEven if the job took 8 hours - which I seriously doubt she would still be making about $15.62 which is above minimum wage in every state but California (again assuming US location)\n\nAlso - although not mentioned - almost every cleaning person is paid in cash and no taxes are withheld. Very few people want to go through the trouble of getting a payroll service to pay for a part time cleaning person. If she worked five days a week her weekly salary would be $625 and tax free is probably the equivalent of closer to $1000 (assuming this is US where FICA is a significant deduction). Not that I am promoting tax avoidance but that is the reality of how most day workers are paid.", "[deleted]", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re completely correct that that\u2019s the expectation of the job.

I do think though that this is one of the cases where she doesn\u00b4t want to hear logic or advice but just wants you to agree to whatever she said and pity her.\n\nIf it was a friend i would advise you to ditch her and find a new friend, but since she\u00b4s your sister you may want to just agree to whatever she says to keep peace as long as it doesn\u00b4t cost you anything.", "I am dying\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.

The irony here is OP is the one voicing pointless comments. His goal was to help, he didn't help, therefore his attempted contribution was pointless. Did it occur to you the woman was perfectly capable of understanding OPs point and was simply looking for emotional support? OPs problem wouldn't have existed had he given a simple \"yeah that sucks, hope it works out for you\" instead of assuming she doesn't comprehend the most basic concept of how a job works.", "You know they were voted NTA right? It wasn't pointless at all, she was venting about something that shouldn't have been vented about.", "NTA, but could you come talk to my husband?  We have cleaners come every other week.  My husband will spend a couple of hours straighteneing up and cleaning before the cleaners come.  He thinks they won't clean if it's messy, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\n\nTo clarify: We do pick up and clean regularly.  So it's not like our house is completely wrecked to start with.\n\nAnd yes, I have 3 kids.  \nThe clean house last 1-2 hours after the kids get home.", "NTA. When my husband and I had a cleaner, we were working 50-80 hours per week each in our own business and had 2 primary school aged children. The kids had chores, but kids cleaning is certainly not like proper cleaning. Every day we would get home with tired, grumpy kids, still have to cook a meal, do laundry, help with reading and homework, and do all the usual things every parent needs to do, but on the day the cleaner came, it was like coming home to heaven. The beds had fresh sheets (I still had to wash them obviously), the floors were clean, the toilets and bathrooms scrubbed, the dusting done, the toys picked up etc. It was fantastic!   \n\nWas it a privilege? Certainly. Should your sister be allowed to whinge about her job? Sure. Should she be surprised that a house gets messy and dirty very quickly with 6 people plus who knows what pets, friends etc. around all the time too? Ummm\u2026\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nSo...your sister took a job cleaning a house and is mad that she has to...\\*checks notes\\* clean the house?\n\nThe pay is on the low side for a family with four kids (well, depending on the size of the house, too)  but any of the rest is none of her business. She should quit, really, as she's going to start half-assing it anyway.", "Cleaning is an endless occupation.", "Saw elsewhere on Reddit, someone now asks every time: \"Do you want to vent or do you want the truth?\" \n\nYou're NTA but in future check whether she wants to vent/a solution/the truth.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think anyones paying $250/week to clean the house if it doesn\u2019t actually need cleaning. Seems like her expectation were very odd.", "Nta. If she works 8 hours a day, she is making $15.60 an hour, 2 days a week. I see jobs offering less with college degree. She has a great gig. And they want her to keep coming because the kids do make a mess. If the didn\u2019t have kids, they might only need her once a month. The kids are the reason she has a job.", "I was going to say Yes, cause it sounds like she was just venting, but then she said they should clean it up themselves and it\u2019s like then you wouldn\u2019t have the job NTA", "Sometimes, people just need to vent and they're not looking for a solution to their problem. You don't have much respect for your sister if you're willing to kick her when she's down. What does it cost you to listen and be sympathic for a minute?  Why tear someone else down?", "NTA. Lol, um, this is her job- Why would they do her job before she comes over to\u2026do her job?", "Average baby sitting rate in my area is ~28$/hr it\u2019s truly wild but this post is exactly why", "My cleaner does this, too. He leaves the washing basket by the bedroom door with anything he\u2019s had to pick up. And any cat toys he finds go into the cat\u2019s basket.\n\nIt took me so long to stop being self-conscious about having a cleaner, and worrying about what he thought of me and my house.\n\nI used to spend a few hours cleaning before he arrived, just so he didn\u2019t think we were grots.\n\nHe actually walked in one day to find me vacuuming, which was awkward as.", "Yeah I have had cleaners and now I clean my own house and there\u2019s no way that\u2019s 10 hours of work. If they have at least 2.5 baths and good gracious I hope they do then that sounds like 3-4 hours every time - more if they are teenage boys.", "Plus whatever rate it is she\u2019s probably getting paid under the table with no taxes or social security being paid for her properly, which is always a bad deal for the employee.", "What other way is there to do math?"]}
