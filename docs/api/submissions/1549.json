She's a paid cleaner, complaining that whoever is paying her to clean, isn't cleaning themselves? \n\nYeah, no.", "NTA. My sister cleaned houses for years and that was what she was paid to do. The dusting, scrubbing, toilets, tubs, sinks, mop, etc. She didn't deal with the families' personal effects (always had a system set up where personal items, if found, were placed in a laundry basket she would take from place to place.)\n\nKindly remind her her job is to clean what her client wants her to clean, not critique their parenting skills.", "NAh \n\nMaybe your sister was naive about what the duties entailed.   If she worked 2 days x week, 8 hours/day (16 hours /week) she's making $15.63/hour.  Not sure if shes getting taxed or if its more of a cash under the table situation, but now that she better understands what her employer expects, she can decide if that's a fair wage or if she would rather find another job soing something else.\n\nIn any case, its probably a valuable learning experience for her with her next job interview, to ask more questions about what she would be willing to do for the money offered.  As she gains more experience, she can start to ask better questions in the interview process, as well as negotiate - example maybe she's willing to do the work asked, but would want $20/hour.", "NTA although as a learning experience, it is sometimes better not to attempt to reason logically with someone who is as clearly delusional on the topic as your sister.\n\nI am in a high cost of living area and $125 to clean a home is considered a decent amount. Even if all of those tasks could NOT be done in less than 8 hours it is a normal wage for a house cleaner.  There is no mention of changing bed linen, doing the laundry or ironing - and those are time consuming so I assume not done twice a week at every visit. Nor is there mention of very time consuming stuff like washing down the interior of the refrigerator which is generally not done every week. It doesn\u2019t take 8 hours of work to clean a house.\n\nEven if the job took 8 hours - which I seriously doubt she would still be making about $15.62 which is above minimum wage in every state but California (again assuming US location)\n\nAlso - although not mentioned - almost every cleaning person is paid in cash and no taxes are withheld. Very few people want to go through the trouble of getting a payroll service to pay for a part time cleaning person. If she worked five days a week her weekly salary would be $625 and tax free is probably the equivalent of closer to $1000 (assuming this is US where FICA is a significant deduction). Not that I am promoting tax avoidance but that is the reality of how most day workers are paid.", "[deleted]", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re completely correct that that\u2019s the expectation of the job. Nobody really pays a cleaner if it\u2019s easy enough to do themselves unless they\u2019re mega-rich and value an extra few hours of freetime more than $250\n\nBut on the other hand\u2026 your sister was just venting to you. Sometimes people just wanna hear \u201cdamn that sucks\u201d and not get into a debate about the nuances of their line of work. I\u2019d feel pretty bad if I vented to my wife about a rough day at work and all she said was \u201cwell if it was easy they wouldn\u2019t pay anyone to do it.\u201d Like yeah, that\u2019s obvious, but I still have the right to feel frustrated.", "NAH. I feel this is one of the times where she just wanted to vent.", "NTA - You only said the truth. I do think though that this is one of the cases where she doesn\u00b4t want to hear logic or advice but just wants you to agree to whatever she said and pity her.\n\nIf it was a friend i would advise you to ditch her and find a new friend, but since she\u00b4s your sister you may want to just agree to whatever she says to keep peace as long as it doesn\u00b4t cost you anything.", "I am dying\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Four kids are messy?! Imagine! That house is probably messy in 2 hours after your sister leaves.. That is good money for the hours.  NAH.

This reminds me of my coworkers who are there to make subs but get mad every time someone makes an order.

What you said seems obvious.", "NAH.  But\u2026\u2026.  Take this as a lesson for when you get older and your wife or girlfriend complains about their job. They  are not looking for your opinion or a solution! They just want you to listen and acknowledge how they are feeling.

You could have just empathized with her misery instead of telling her she's wrong.", "How many hours is she working those 2 days? If its less than or = to 8 (using the symbols made it look sus) then that's more than fair compensation.", "But its only twice a week. With the amount of cleaning, if it takes her 4 hrs a day (which sounds reasonable) then shes making like 30 an hr. Doesnt sound too bad", "If she found 4 more of these jobs, that paid the same, she'd be making 60k/yr assuming 4 hours a house a day.\n\n12k a year for 8 hours of work a week is amazing.", "complaints for the sake of complaining are pointless.", "Yeah no, this sounds to me this isn\u2019t the first time this conversation has happened for op. it\u2019s the first time op finally spoke up and said what sis needed to hear: this is what you\u2019re being paid to do- either stfu about what your expected to do or leave the client. Bitching about your job every time is annoying to hear and I would say something too. NTA", "I couldn't imagine empathizing with someone who is completely out of touch with what they think their job is", "It's a list of tasks, so she leaves as soon as they are done. I'm not sure how long it takes her to do them, but I doubt it's more than eight hours.", "[deleted]", "\nYou must be new around here. (earth)", "Yah NTA then. I thought maybe there was a chance the people were taking advantage of her time but honestly it sounds like she's being more than fairly compensated.", "I definitely agree that we should all get to complain/vent about  our jobs in general, but the job is not intended to be your only source of income seeing as they dont request her to come in daily for half hour, but twice a week (leaving 5 free days to pick up some other side gigs or cleaning clients). Thats some people's dream situation (people who get bored easily, are fast paced, like to organize and clean, etc.)\n\n Also, the complaints are akin to a clothing store worker complaining about customers not putting the items back on the rack properly (which is a fair complaint cause people are slobs) but at the same time, they hired her specifically for that reason. So yes, she should be allowed to complain, but we cant expect much sympathy.", "Nope :) there's just a lot of people who do pointless things", "Lololol that\u2019s amazing. She expects the kids to do chores so she doesn\u2019t have to actually work at her job. Sounds like she needed a serious reality check. Why on earth would anyone pay to have a house cleaned twice a week that only needs it once or twice a month? NTA.", "NTA\n\n$125 a day sounds about right for entry level work like house cleaning. Assuming an 8 hour day, that's just over $15/hr. And no, they don't need to help. That's what they're paying her for.", "NTA\n\nGuys can anyone think some is offering $250 for what sounds like 4 hours work. \n\nFor $250 I'd be expecting 12 hours work.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your sister needs to grow up and get a reality check. She is the hired help. They are literally paying her to clean up the messes they don't want to.", "NTA", "No job that looks easy is easy, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be a job. You just told your sister this bluntly, so NTA and why would and person clean up if they had a cleaner? Like literally a paid\n cleaner biweekly, that\u2019s a laugh", "NAH, you spoke your truth because from your perspective your sister was just whining, but it also sounds like she was just venting and wanted to supportive ear. It sounds like you and her need to have a conversation about what your boundary is with listening to her, cuz if she's just coming to you to dump, it's not your job to listen to her and she needs to go somewhere else", "NTA your sister isn\u2019t exactly a genius for that one lol", "Definitely NTA. You have a good point and I would have said the same. If the job is easy I could do it myself and would not pay anyone!", "NTA.\n\n>pointed out that if it was as easy as she wanted, they would just do it themselves and not be willing to pay someone to do it. After all, a thousand dollars a month is a lot of money.\n\nExactly this, even the richest of people wouldn't pay someone to clean if they could do it themselves. If she expected an easy cleaning job then she was sorely mistaken and you were right for pointing out the fault in her thinking.\n\n>My sister said I'm an asshole, and my mom said I was being a contrarian. But honestly, I think she needed to hear that. Was I an ass?\n\nYou mum is also mistaken, it's one thing to be contrarian, it's another thing to tell someone that they made a bad decision because they didn't think things through. You're not disagreeing for the sake of it, your disagreement is one that most people would have.\n\nOP you're NTA, tell your sister if she wants an easy job she should look for work that is done for free.", "NAH, only because I think she\u2019s getting underpaid personally. Source: several family members who either work for a cleaning company doing jobs similar to what your sisters doing, or who run cleaning companies offering these kinds of services.", "NTA. \n\n\nYour sister's pretty clueless, huh?", "NAH.

It's a calculation that says if I spend this 16 hours on my business instead of cleaning my house, I close an average of 1 more client a week for another $1000 in profit, so it's worth it to pay someone else $250 to clean for me.", "Hard disagree on anyone but the mega-rich paying a cleaner. Lived with 4 roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment during grad school and part of our rent went towards a cleaning person once a week. It made the roommate situation exponentially better than any I'd had before. Everyone had the expectation of picking up before they came to clean so the cleaners wouldn't waste time on tidying our stuff away. That meant a cleaner house day to day and no one had to do the chores they hated every week. \n\nNot nagging or fighting about chores was a magical experience and well worth the money.", "Oh yeah, such \u2018misery\u2019 \ud83d\ude02", "Maybe if you\u2019re a workaholic or there\u2019s a very specific goal and deadline you have in mind, like upsizing your house so your kids can all have their own bedrooms by the time they\u2019re approaching being teenagers. \n\nLargely though, I think you\u2019ll find that a lot of people who make good incomes don\u2019t see that calculation as a \u201ctime is money\u201d thing, but rather a \u201ctime is family/friends/experiences/etc\u201d thing. If you already have a nice house, nice cars, nice appliances, cool gadgets and hobby stuff, the value you put on an extra 1k/month in terms of possessions it can buy you declines pretty significantly", "I moreso meant that only a rich household would be likely to hire a cleaner for a super trivial amount of work, say a couple hours a week worth of chores.", "I have a cleaner bi-monthly and I live alone. I am just not as good at the heavy cleaning and hate it and am willing to pay.", "You're right. I framed my reply too narrowly because I am not yet in that position. Whatever their objective is, be it money or personal relationships or experiences or philanthropy, or whatever... if time doing that minus money paid for cleaning gets them further toward their goal than time cleaning, then hire cleaner.", "Oh, we did it for the super trivial bathroom, floor, and counter cleaning. We could have easily knocked it all out in a 30 minute burst of all five of us cleaning. \n\nIt was life changing!", "Seriously, having enough money to say \"I hate cleaning the bathroom, I'm going to pay someone else to clean the bathroom\" is amazing!\n\nI definitely don't have it in my budget now, but hope one day I will again.", "Free time is part of that though is all I meant :) \n\nIf you\u2019re well-off then you can afford to value stuff like just hanging out with your SO and kids in the living room more often, instead of being busy with chores on their weekend out of school, as being worth more than whatever the $1000/month could buy you", "We only have so many outlets in life. Most of which cost MONEY. Complaining is an easy way to get stress release and menial non-traumatising complaints to family and friends is harmless.", "and also pointless", "Your comments here seem pretty pointless too.", "YTA\n\nI will always remember how hard my first day of my very first job was.  I knew going in that being a grounds keeper of a major amusement park would be hard, but I didn't realize it would be *that* hard.

But maybe in the future try and simply let her vent because housekeeping jobs ARE hard.", "She took a job that pays $250/week for coming either once or twice a week housecleaning\u2026 while expecting $250/week for coming once a week or every other week tidying up..? \n\nNTA. Your sister needs to learn that she does not get to change a job description to meet her own needs.", "NTA. You spoke the absolute truth!", " They are literally paying her to clean up the messes they don't want to.", "Maybe he should ask them first?
