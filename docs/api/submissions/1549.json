She's a paid cleaner, complaining that whoever is paying her to clean, isn't cleaning themselves? \n\nYeah, no.", "NTA. My sister cleaned houses for years and that was what she was paid to do. The dusting, scrubbing, toilets, tubs, sinks, mop, etc. She didn't deal with the families' personal effects (always had a system set up where personal items, if found, were placed in a laundry basket she would take from place to place.)\n\nKindly remind her her job is to clean what her client wants her to clean, not critique their parenting skills.", "NAh \n\nMaybe your sister was naive about what the duties entailed.   If she worked 2 days x week, 8 hours/day (16 hours /week) she's making $15.63/hour.  Not sure if shes getting taxed or if its more of a cash under the table situation, but now that she better understands what her employer expects, she can decide if that's a fair wage or if she would rather find another job soing something else.\n\nIn any case, its probably a valuable learning experience for her with her next job interview, to ask more questions about what she would be willing to do for the money offered.  As she gains more experience, she can start to ask better questions in the interview process, as well as negotiate - example maybe she's willing to do the work asked, but would want $20/hour.", "NTA although as a learning experience, it is sometimes better not to attempt to reason logically with someone who is as clearly delusional on the topic as your sister.\n\nI am in a high cost of living area and $125 to clean a home is considered a decent amount. Even all of those tasks could be done in less than 8 hours as there is no mention of changing bed linen, doing the laundry or ironing - and those are time consuming. Nor is there mention of very time consuming stuff like washing down the interior of the refrigerator which is generally not done every week.\n\nEven if the job took 8 hours - which I seriously doubt she would still be making about $15.62 which is above minimum wage in every state but California (again assuming US location)\n\nAlso - although not mentioned - almost every cleaning person is paid in cash and no taxes are withheld. Very few people want to go through the trouble of getting a payroll service to pay for a part time cleaning person. If she worked five days a week her weekly salary would be $750 and tax free is probably the equivalent of closer to $1000 (assuming this is US where FICA is a significant deduction). Not that I am promoting tax avoidance but that is the reality of how most day workers are paid.", "$1000 a month for a job is $12,000 a year. ESH.", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re completely correct that that\u2019s the expectation of the job. Nobody really pays a cleaner if it\u2019s easy enough to do themselves unless they\u2019re mega-rich and value an extra few hours of freetime more than $250\n\nBut on the other hand\u2026 your sister was just venting to you. Sometimes people just wanna hear \u201cdamn that sucks\u201d and not get into a debate about the nuances of their line of work. I\u2019d feel pretty bad if I vented to my wife about a rough day at work and all she said was \u201cwell if it was easy they wouldn\u2019t pay anyone to do it.\u201d Like yeah, that\u2019s obvious, but I still have the right to feel frustrated.", "NAH. I feel this is one of the times where she just wanted to vent.", "NTA - You only said the truth. I do think though that this is one of the cases where she doesn\u00b4t want to hear logic or advice but just wants you to agree to whatever she said and pity her.\n\nIf it was a friend i would advise you to ditch her and find a new friend, but since she\u00b4s your sister you may want to just agree to whatever she says to keep peace as long as it doesn\u00b4t cost you anything.", "I am dying\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Four kids are messy?! Imagine! That house is probably messy in 2 hours after your sister leaves.. That is good money for the hours.  NAH.

This reminds me of my coworkers who are there to make subs but get mad every time someone makes an order. Like, why do you think you're there?", "It\u2019s almost like they hired a cleaner to combat mess they can\u2019t get ahold of for whatever reason. Almost. NTA", "NTA.  What you said seems obvious.", "NAH.  But\u2026\u2026.  Take this as a lesson for when you get older and your wife or girlfriend complains about their job. They  are not looking for your opinion or a solution! They just want you to listen and acknowledge how they are feeling.

You could have just empathized with her misery instead of telling her she's wrong.", "How many hours is she working those 2 days? If its less than or = to 8 (using the symbols made it look sus) then that's more than fair compensation.", "But its only twice a week. With the amount of cleaning, if it takes her 4 hrs a day (which sounds reasonable) then shes making like 30 an hr. Doesnt sound too bad", "If she found 4 more of these jobs, that paid the same, she'd be making 60k/yr assuming 4 hours a house a day.\n\n12k a year for 8 hours of work a week is amazing.", "complaints for the sake of complaining are pointless.", "Yeah no, this sounds to me this isn\u2019t the first time this conversation has happened for op. it\u2019s the first time op finally spoke up and said what sis needed to hear: this is what you\u2019re being paid to do- either stfu about what your expected to do or leave the client. Bitching about your job every time is annoying to hear and I would say something too. NTA", "I couldn't imagine empathizing with someone who is completely out of touch with what they think their job is", "It's a list of tasks, so she leaves as soon as they are done. I'm not sure how long it takes her to do them, but I doubt it's more than eight hours.", "I mean, the details matter, but acting like its absurd to complain at all, or saying its a lot of money when it doesnt necessarily pan out that way is a bit facetious and that's all I was really trying to point out. Sure, its not slave labor, but it doesnt sound like an opportunity that gets her above the poverty line by itself. It may not take much of her time, but its certainly not some wonderful wage", "\nYou must be new around here. (earth)", "Yah NTA then. I thought maybe there was a chance the people were taking advantage of her time but honestly it sounds like she's being more than fairly compensated.", "I definitely agree that we should all get to complain/vent about  our jobs in general, but the job is not intended to be your only source of income seeing as they dont request her to come in daily for half hour, but twice a week (leaving 5 free days to pick up some other side gigs or cleaning clients). Thats some people's dream situation (people who get bored easily, are fast paced, like to organize and clean, etc.)\n\n Also, the complaints are akin to a clothing store worker complaining about customers not putting the items back on the rack properly (which is a fair complaint cause people are slobs) but at the same time, they hired her specifically for that reason. So yes, she should be allowed to complain, but we cant expect much sympathy.", "Nope :) there's just a lot of people who do pointless things"]}
