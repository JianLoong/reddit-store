My partner has a long-term friend of over 20 years, and they have had feelings for each other back and forth for at least a decade. Over time, there always seemed to be something preventing them from ever getting together, and now my partner says they are done pining for them and is completely committed to me. \n\nBut that seemed to only encourage the friend's attention more, and recently while intoxicated at our home, the friend kissed my partner, and got in my face with threats and insults, directly stating that they should be with my partner instead, and refused to leave, even going so far as to call the police when forced outside.\n\nNow, it has been less than 2 months since this event, and this friend has had a string of bad luck, and now needs a place to stay. So, my partner, out of a sense of loyalty to this long time friend, as offered our living room to them.

This is a two yeses or one no kind of decision.\n\nIn this case, it should have been an automatic **no!** for both of you. If you've previously had to  deal with the police over this person, that's persona non grata territory.

NOPE.\n\nYour partner has a problem and obviously is not \"done pining for them\". Establish your boundaries and stand your ground. Your partner does not have a right to \"invite\" that person over after they've so clearly overstepped their boundaries. \n\nYour partner is at fault, their friend is at fault. But you're good.

I would tell him if the friends sleeping in the house I won't be and he can talk to my attorney from here on out.", "NTA - you need to communicate to your partner that it makes you upset and uncomfortable and that they are disrespecting your boundaries by doing this and that the friend needs to leave.", "NTA. Oh hell no. It shouldn't even be a question that they're not allowed in your home after what happened. Your partner still has complete loyalty to them. You're still in second place. Is that where you want to be?", "NTA but your husband is for wanting to inflict this on you.  He should be loyal and putting you FIRST and should have cut ties after the incident.  If he continues to allow this, you know what you need to do (pack your backs and leave and go for divorce).", "NTA - you need to have a come-to-jesus with your partner.  I'd consider this one of those times when an ultimatum is appropriate.  \n\nEither you continue to spend time with her and allow her to disrespect our relationship, or you pick me.  Either-Or.  No more both.  No more friendship and support for the friend, make a clean break with them, or I'll make one with you.", "NTA. Holy hell.", "No, no, no.

You get to veto anyone sleeping on your couch.\n\nHave you ever offered your couch to someone?  If the two of you routinely have people sleep on your couch then he has a *slightly* better case.  But still this is your call.", "NTA! You should throw them both out!", "NTA.\n\nBut your husband is for extending an invitation to this person despite: *\"recently while intoxicated at our home, the friend kissed my partner, and got in my face with threats and insults, directly stating that they should be with my partner instead, and refused to leave, even going so far as to call the police when forced outside.\"*", "NTA\n\nYou deserve better, my friend. \n\nIf this were me, I would probably tell my partner, \"If that person comes to stay with us, then our relationship is over.

I already have trust issues with this person being around  and for you to show me you are committed to the marriage/relationship... then they need to be out of our life, not sleeping in the house.

And WTH???", "NTA. And this is how my brother ended up divorced, when his wife moved her new old flame in.", "NTA\n\nPlease, respect yourself. Everyone deserves a partner that's fully committed to them.

This feels like a situation that you're never going to be free of as long as you're with him, so you either have to choose to fight for your relationship or else get yourself out of there. But please don't put up with being stuck in the middle with both of them disrespecting your feelings this way.

You're NTA for being upset and I actually think you're under-reacting. You live in the home too and have every right to tell this person they're not welcome.", "NTA but also this is such a red flag from your partner. What on earth are they doing? Especially after the incident with threats and insults directed at you and kissing your partner? Your partner is definitely the asshole for this one though.", "NTA probably look into throwing them both out", "NTA but damn get some standards.\n\nThat's not a friend. That's a love interest.  Is it really enough that your partner isn't actually physically cheating? They love each other. They love each other and now they're living together.

Do yourself a favor and get out of this relationship now. Your partner doesn't respect you or your relationship enough to tell this friend to kick rocks after the kiss and getting aggressive with you.

I'd get out now if I were you.", "Nope nope NOPE under no circumstances does this \"friend\" stay at your house. No no no.\n\nOut of a sense of loyalty to the \"FRIEND\" partner offered the living room. What about loyalty to YOU?\n\n\"Friend\" threatened and insulted you!

You allowed this person to act that way towards you, and now you\u2019re allowing them into your home?\n\nYour husband has absolutely zero respect for you to offer her a roof over her head when she kissed him and insulted you like that. And called the cops on you!? \n\nI would definitely say there are still feelings there if he\u2019s willing to risk your marriage for this person. He owes no loyalty to her, his loyalty should lie with you. And it doesn\u2019t\u2014 not even a little bit. \n\nNTA but he and her both are. And they\u2019ve certainly slept together, which is makes it even crazier that she is allowed in your living room to sleep and live.", "INFO: You say marriage and then you say partner, so are you married? Second how long have you been married because you've said that they've been back and forth with feelings for a decade and tha he says he's finally done pining for them and is completely committed to you. Why you marry someone when they were in love with someone else anyway? Why did you stay married if he's told you he has feelings for someone else? When did he say that he is finally committed to be with?\n\nThere just seems to be too many holes for me.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nFirst person has harassed you and repeatedly tried to breakup your relationship. It\u2019s entirely reasonable at this point that your partner has to choose between you two.

I would prefer to avoid specific details on that. \n\nMy partner has done their best to assure me that nothing is going on, but I have felt that there might be more there for a while, and this event was the confirmation that what I felt from the friend is accurate, they do have strong feelings for my partner. \n\nI also never specified that the decade of pining was the most recent decade, but that's my fault. Also, having feelings is not a betrayal for me, acting on those feelings is. My partner is very communicative with me, and I feel safe that they are not lying to me.
