I don\u2019t have an anaphylactic reaction but I break out into severe hives and have terrible stomach problems when I eat it. My sister recently graduated from college and decided to hold a party. Problem was, it was a seafood party and there were no other options at the restaurant she chose which was a seafood restaurant. I spoke to her about bringing my own food but she said she\u2019d prefer if I didn\u2019t and when I contemplated going, she said i don\u2019t get anaphylactic and nothing happens just from being near the food so I have no excuse not to attend. I thought no biggie, I\u2019m not at risk just from being close to the food and I can go eat elsewhere or something after the meal is over so I could be there for my sister. Problem is, I worked a 30 hour shift and was on call on a very busy day so I couldn\u2019t find time to have anything outside of a protein bar. By the time my shift ended, it was almost time for the party so I couldn\u2019t prep anything to eat before hand or wait for delivery. I decided to eat a small amount at the party since I was famished and pick out the seafood. I just quickly got ready and had a Benadryl to help with the hives and asked my husband to place an order for liquid IV that would be delivered the next day to help hydrate after the inevitable stomach problems I\u2019d have. Well, picking out the seafood didn\u2019t work and I still got sick but not too bad thanks to my preparation but I was out of it the next day and very dehydrated. \n\nMy mum asked me to come over since the whole family was there for the first time since Covid started and I declined. I told her I was dead tired from the shift and party but she kept trying to convince me to come. I told her I wasn\u2019t  well and she started to accuse me of making up excuses. I eventually snapped and told her I\u2019d had seafood and had a reaction so I was sick and couldn\u2019t make it. My sister for some assumed it was a dig at her and I was cribbing about not being accommodated on her big day. Not once did I even mention the word or make scene. I also made it very clear it was my responsibility since I knowingly ate seafood but she\u2019s been calling me some choice names for making her look inconsiderate. She told me I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut and not told people why I\u2019m sick and should have cited other reasons to not have made it to the family get together.

Why would anyone force someone with a seafood allergy to attend a party at a restaurant that only serves seafood?", "NTA\n\nwhy didn't she want you to bring your own food? there's one asshole here, and it's not you", "NTA. If your sister thought you eating seafood was such a little thing she shouldn't care about you telling people you got sick from eating it.", "If my family were so wilfully careless about my health, I wouldn't be going out of my way to spend time with them.\n\nI mean, you probably shouldn't have eaten the seafood\u2014there weren't any bread rolls?\u2014but your relations are being assholes.\n\nNTA", "NTA. And what does she mean you're making her look inconsiderate? She WAS inconsiderate! Didn't even let you bring your food knowing full well you'd get sick from 100% of the available food.", "Esh. Your sister is definitely kind of an AH for not having an optional meal choice although it\u2019s not her fault. You should have taken responsibility for your own health so you didn\u2019t get sick. You knew the seafood would make you sick yet you ate it, anyway. You couldn\u2019t bring your own food but you had other options: you could have skipped the event, spoken with staff for any seafood free options; arrived late after eating, and/or packed a lunch/snack to eat on the way to the party. \n\nBasically, you had a lot of options. Your sister is selfish but not responsible and you should be honest about that. Sorry you got sick tho!", "NTA I would NEVER have chosen that restaurant. You were extremely kind and if your honesty made her feel bad then that\u2019s 100% on her. I\u2019m sure one of your family members must have had your back which in turn she acted selfishly about AGAIN.", "NTA.  Next time, pack your own food!  Your sister was an idiot to tell you not to, and you were an idiot to listen to her.  You \\*know\\* that seafood makes you sick, so stay away from it!  Sometimes a 'not so bad' allergic reaction grows into an anaphylactic allergic reaction.  Why would you test your own health like that.", "NTA\n\nYour sister knows the issue you have with seafood. this is her fault and makes her the AH", "NTA\n\nIt took quite a bit of mental gymnastics, but apparently your mother and sister are quite agile to have condemned you from every angle. Hopefully, you also inherited some of that extreme agility and can avoid their snares going forward.", "Ok, look. You're TA to *yourself*. You work 30 hours and then go to a party? Tell your family you just worked 30 hours and need to sleep.\n\nYou have time to get ready for the party but you can't make yourself some cup noodles? TEll your family you'll be half an hour late and have a real meal.\n\nBut instead you go to the party, and pre-order IV REHYDRATION MEDICAL EQUIPMENT because you know you're going to be sick? Why would you do this to yourself? \n\nThe question is not what you told or didn't tell your family. The question is why you're treating yourself like this. \n\nWhere do you work that you don't get a meal break during a 30-HOUR SHIFT?\n\nNo judgment because this is really, really bizarre. Is this even real? I doubt this is real.", "ESH. So this seafood restaurant didn\u2019t have any choices for side orders? Like a salad or some veggies, a baked potato or something? I can\u2019t believe that they served strictly seafood and nothing else. You should\u2019ve talked to the waitstaff. I\u2019m sure they could\u2019ve accommodated you.\n\nYour sister and your family suck because they know about your seafood allergy, but they forced you into going anyway. Then they made a big stink about you being sick. You being sick was partially your fault yes, but if they hadn\u2019t forced you, maybe you wouldn\u2019t have gotten sick.\n\nNext time, something like this arises, talk to the waitstaff at the restaurant. This day and age so many people have allergies to so many things, most restaurants can accommodate.", "Ugh, siblings can be so inconsiderate. You should've just told your ma you had explosive diarrhea and couldn't make it. Solved two problems in one excuse! NTA", "ESH.\n\n Your family shouldn't be minimising your health regardless of whether it's a \"real\" allergy or not. What matters is that you know it consistently makes you unwell.\n\nThey also shouldn't blame you for the fact they can't take no for an answer and cornered you until they got an answer they liked even less.\n\n_Your_ failing was that you knew it would make you sick and you ate it anyway. I don't believe that there's nothing at a seafood restaurant that doesn't contain seafood. And if there was, you still have could looked after yourself or dipped out after a 30hour shift. You need to learn to say no when you need to and put yourself first when no-one else is doing so.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister should have chosen a restaurant where you could eat something, but if there was literally nothing to order at the restaurant that didn't include seafood (no side dishes? bread? salads?), you should have stopped for food on the way there. Being a few minutes late or asking your husband to step out and get you something to eat would have been better than deliberately eating something you were allergic to.", "NTA. Your sister sucks for not taking any care or consideration about your allergies. You suck because you were the one who didn't eat for like 30hrs, you were the one who decided to eat contaminated food. Next time, just leave and go get some food that's not going to make you sick. However! You're not the asshole for telling them why you're sick. They wouldn't leave it alone so you told them the truth.", "ESH. But I mostly am aiming it at you, because you *knew* it would make you sick and ate anyway. If you knew it would be so bad you ordered *IV fluids*, then you should have more sense than to think picking out the seafood would make it ok to eat.\n\nStop to eat and blame work on why you are late to the party next time. Or skip a party at seafood places entirely. Take care of yourself first.", "ESH\n\nOnly adding you in too because it's time to learn how to not feel guilty about prioritizing your own health first.\n\nYOU did this to yourself, by trying to be over-accommodating. 30 hour shift, and eating one protein bar? You suck for how little you're taking care of yourself, then adding in the sick you KNEW eating the food would cause. You could have told her you'd be late because of the shift and you needed to eat first. You could have skipped. You had choices over attending.\n\nStart taking care of yourself. Self-care and taking care of your needs aren't selfish, it's survival and it's kindness to yourself.", "You made yourself sick for whatever reason and are now playing the victim. So yeah YTA. Don't go telling me there wasn't any seafood free sides or even plain bread. And you absolutely couldn't have stopped at some fast food joint on the way there/back from work. And just not eating for additional 2h wasn't the option either?\n\nCome on.. who are you kidding. If I was so sick from certain food that I'd need a liquid IV (that your husband can order up front, but getting you a sandwich is too much to ask for) I just wouldn't eat it. You're not a toddler, you can go without food for a a day or two.", "I laughed at that. Take responsibility for your life and heath. There really is no one to blame but yourself. And do be cautious cause allergy responses can change (and worsen) as you age. \n\nHaving said that, you didn\u2019t make your sister look inconsiderate, she is inconsiderate. If a family member has an allergy, you don\u2019t make them attend an event around/involving that allergy. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for telling people why you are sick. But YTA to yourself for making yourself sick. It is 100% on you.", "Small correction- Liquid iv is a powder that comes in single dose packets that you add to water, it\u2019s not medical equipment. And it\u2019s 10 dollars at Walmart.", "Having a son with a seafood allergy, I can say that even potatoes cooked in the same vicinity would make him puke all night", "I\u2019ve recently been to one where there was literally nothing but seafood. I was surprised. I guess they figured if people had allergies they wouldn\u2019t go anyway. I don\u2019t know.", "A seafood restaurants food, even if they have non seafood options, is being prepared in the same kitchen so there is still a risk.\n\nI have a severe allergy to seafood, i just won't step into a seafood restaurant as the risk of contamination is too high, even just for a salad. \n\nBut you are right, Op should not have eaten the food knowing they would get sick.", "Ah, thanks! Never heard of the stuff before; today I have become smarter.\n\nI think the rest of my post still stands though. OP should be half an hour late and have a meal that won't make them sick!", "I don\u2019t go out to eat much, so I guess I don\u2019t know. But I do know that even a place like Red Lobster that is strictly seafood has non-seafood choices.", "I was surprised actually. I don\u2019t love seafood, at least Florida seafood. You think it would be good but it sucks. So when I went out with friends to a seafood restaurant I figured I could get something other than that. Nope. Crappy shrimp was what I ended with."]}
