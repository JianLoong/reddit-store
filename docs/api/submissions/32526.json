I don\u2019t have an anaphylactic reaction but I break out into severe hives and have terrible stomach problems when I eat it. My sister recently graduated from college and decided to hold a party. Problem was, it was a seafood party and there were no other options at the restaurant she chose which was a seafood restaurant. I spoke to her about bringing my own food but she said she\u2019d prefer if I didn\u2019t and when I contemplated going, she said i don\u2019t get anaphylactic and nothing happens just from being near the food so I have no excuse not to attend. I thought no biggie, I\u2019m not at risk just from being close to the food and I can go eat elsewhere or something after the meal is over so I could be there for my sister. Problem is, I worked a 30 hour shift and was on call on a very busy day so I couldn\u2019t find time to have anything outside of a protein bar. By the time my shift ended, it was almost time for the party so I couldn\u2019t prep anything to eat before hand or wait for delivery. I decided to eat a small amount at the party since I was famished and pick out the seafood. I just quickly got ready and had a Benadryl to help with the hives and asked my husband to place an order for liquid IV that would be delivered the next day to help hydrate after the inevitable stomach problems I\u2019d have. Well, picking out the seafood didn\u2019t work and I still got sick but not too bad thanks to my preparation but I was out of it the next day and very dehydrated. \n\nMy mum asked me to come over since the whole family was there for the first time since Covid started and I declined. I told her I was dead tired from the shift and party but she kept trying to convince me to come. I told her I wasn\u2019t  well and she started to accuse me of making up excuses. I eventually snapped and told her I\u2019d had seafood and had a reaction so I was sick and couldn\u2019t make it. My sister for some assumed it was a dig at her and I was cribbing about not being accommodated on her big day. Not once did I even mention the word or make scene. I also made it very clear it was my responsibility since I knowingly ate seafood but she\u2019s been calling me some choice names for making her look inconsiderate. She told me I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut and not told people why I\u2019m sick and should have cited other reasons to not have made it to the family get together. AITA?\n\nEDIT: To answer some of the most common questions/points-\n1) I do not live in the US. The nature of my work does not have a fixed meal time.\n2) I could not just skip the event due to it being held to celebrate my baby sister. The whole family was expecting my presence.\n3) liquid IV is a brand for soluble electrolyte powder, not real medical intravenous equipment.\n4) The non-seafood options were mostly bread rolls and dessert. I am a diabetic so dessert was off the table and the bread was cooked in the same space as the seafood so I would have gotten sick anyways.\n5) I have no doubt that I am TA to myself and as mentioned in the post, I take responsibility for what happened to me. \n6) I had about 20mins between coming home from my shift and having to leave for the party. Delivery where I live takes over 30mins and there was the expectation that I would have to be on time as a \u201ccore family member\u201d\n7) My question was not about how I treated myself, rather whether Inwas TA for telling my family why I was sick since my sister assumed I was calling her out and making her look bad.\n8) I spoke to the restaurant when I had a little time and they said they serve exclusively seafood and anything like bread and salads were cooked in the same kitchen/vicinity as the seafood and so would have been equally sickening. \n9) I am aware how stupid of a move it was, I was simply trying to do everything and be there for my family which I realise on hindsight came at the cost of my well being. \n10) This was her day and she absolutely loves seafood. I didn\u2019t want to look entitled by asking her to change the location. Could I have gotten food after the event? No, it was quite late and most fastfood joints had closed. We moved to the restaurants bar which closed at 12am at around 9pm and they didn\u2019t have anything outside cocktail nuts which also give me stomach problems. I was on my way home at 12:15 and no restaurants or fastfood joints were open and I was frankly too tired to go out of my way to find a place.", "created_utc": 1701946169, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ct18f/aita_for_telling_my_27f_family_the_reason_im_sick/", "score": 413, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is definitely kind of an AH for not having an optional meal choice although it\u2019s not her fault. You should have taken responsibility for your own health so you didn\u2019t get sick. You knew the seafood would make you sick yet you ate it, anyway. You couldn\u2019t bring your own food but you had other options: you could have skipped the event, spoken with staff for any seafood free options; arrived late after eating, and/or packed a lunch/snack to eat on the way to the party. \n\nBasically, you had a lot of options. Your sister is selfish but not responsible and you should be honest about that. Sorry you got sick tho!", "NTA I would NEVER have chosen that restaurant.

I\u2019m sure they could\u2019ve accommodated you.\n\nYour sister and your family suck because they know about your seafood allergy, but they forced you into going anyway.

You being sick was partially your fault yes, but if they hadn\u2019t forced you, maybe you wouldn\u2019t have gotten sick.\n\nNext time, something like this arises, talk to the waitstaff at the restaurant.

What matters is that you know it consistently makes you unwell.\n\nThey also shouldn't blame you for the fact they can't take no for an answer and cornered you until they got an answer they liked even less.\n\n_Your_ failing was that you knew it would make you sick and you ate it anyway. I don't believe that there's nothing at a seafood restaurant that doesn't contain seafood. And if there was, you still have could looked after yourself or dipped out after a 30hour shift.

Your sister then starts treating you badly due to her ego and you're wondering if you did wrong by daring to tell the truth?\n\nYou need to start standing up for yourself and start learning to stick to it when you say no.
