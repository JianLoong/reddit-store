I don\u2019t have an anaphylactic reaction but I break out into severe hives and have terrible stomach problems when I eat it. My sister recently graduated from college and decided to hold a party. Problem was, it was a seafood party and there were no other options at the restaurant she chose which was a seafood restaurant. I spoke to her about bringing my own food but she said she\u2019d prefer if I didn\u2019t and when I contemplated going, she said i don\u2019t get anaphylactic and nothing happens just from being near the food so I have no excuse not to attend. I thought no biggie, I\u2019m not at risk just from being close to the food and I can go eat elsewhere or something after the meal is over so I could be there for my sister. Problem is, I worked a 30 hour shift and was on call on a very busy day so I couldn\u2019t find time to have anything outside of a protein bar. By the time my shift ended, it was almost time for the party so I couldn\u2019t prep anything to eat before hand or wait for delivery. I decided to eat a small amount at the party since I was famished and pick out the seafood. I just quickly got ready and had a Benadryl to help with the hives and asked my husband to place an order for liquid IV that would be delivered the next day to help hydrate after the inevitable stomach problems I\u2019d have. Well, picking out the seafood didn\u2019t work and I still got sick but not too bad thanks to my preparation but I was out of it the next day and very dehydrated. \n\nMy mum asked me to come over since the whole family was there for the first time since Covid started and I declined. I told her I was dead tired from the shift and party but she kept trying to convince me to come. I told her I wasn\u2019t  well and she started to accuse me of making up excuses. I eventually snapped and told her I\u2019d had seafood and had a reaction so I was sick and couldn\u2019t make it. My sister for some assumed it was a dig at her and I was cribbing about not being accommodated on her big day. Not once did I even mention the word or make scene. I also made it very clear it was my responsibility since I knowingly ate seafood but she\u2019s been calling me some choice names for making her look inconsiderate. She told me I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut and not told people why I\u2019m sick and should have cited other reasons to not have made it to the family get together. AITA?\n\nEDIT: To answer some of the most common questions/points-\n1) I do not live in the US. The nature of my work does not have a fixed meal time.\n2) I could not just skip the event due to it being held to celebrate my baby sister. The whole family was expecting my presence.\n3) liquid IV is a brand for soluble electrolyte powder, not real medical intravenous equipment.\n4) The non-seafood options were mostly bread rolls and dessert. I am a diabetic so dessert was off the table and the bread was cooked in the same space as the seafood so I would have gotten sick anyways.\n5) I have no doubt that I am TA to myself and as mentioned in the post, I take responsibility for what happened to me. \n6) I had about 20mins between coming home from my shift and having to leave for the party. Delivery where I live takes over 30mins and there was the expectation that I would have to be on time as a \u201ccore family member\u201d\n7) My question was not about how I treated myself, rather whether Inwas TA for telling my family why I was sick since my sister assumed I was calling her out and making her look bad.\n8) I spoke to the restaurant when I had a little time and they said they serve exclusively seafood and anything like bread and salads were cooked in the same kitchen/vicinity as the seafood and so would have been equally sickening. \n9) I am aware how stupid of a move it was, I was simply trying to do everything and be there for my family which I realise on hindsight came at the cost of my well being. \n10) This was her day and she absolutely loves seafood. I didn\u2019t want to look entitled by asking her to change the location. Could I have gotten food after the event? No, it was quite late and most fastfood joints had closed. We moved to the restaurants bar which closed at 12am at around 9pm and they didn\u2019t have anything outside cocktail nuts which also give me stomach problems. I was on my way home at 12:15 and no restaurants or fastfood joints were open and I was frankly too tired to go out of my way to find a place.", "created_utc": 1701946169, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ct18f/aita_for_telling_my_27f_family_the_reason_im_sick/", "score": 627, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is definitely kind of an AH for not having an optional meal choice although it\u2019s not her fault. You should have taken responsibility for your own health so you didn\u2019t get sick. You knew the seafood would make you sick yet you ate it, anyway. You couldn\u2019t bring your own food but you had other options: you could have skipped the event, spoken with staff for any seafood free options; arrived late after eating, and/or packed a lunch/snack to eat on the way to the party. \n\nBasically, you had a lot of options.

What matters is that you know it consistently makes you unwell.\n\nThey also shouldn't blame you for the fact they can't take no for an answer and cornered you until they got an answer they liked even less.\n\n_Your_ failing was that you knew it would make you sick and you ate it anyway. I don't believe that there's nothing at a seafood restaurant that doesn't contain seafood. And if there was, you still have could looked after yourself or dipped out after a 30hour shift.

The benedryl is stopping the reaction.  If you continue to use it like this you will develop a resistance and it will fail and you will die.\n\nETA: to be clear, hives and vomit are documented reactions my daughter has had to her allergens.  I also recommend you take a controlled test on other common allergens, finding them by accident isn't fun.", "NTA. Your family knew about your allergy and you reminded them. They could have told you its ok not to come that night and let it be known the the other guest(if asked) that you just came of a 30hr shift. Then they could have just asked you to come by the next day when the whole family got together that way you all could celebrate your sister", "NTA. BUT, be very careful with your allergy. I am very allergic to fish and seafood, I used to take handfuls of antihistamines before I\u2019d eat it, to try and control the hives, etc.. I told my Dr what I did and he said that one day, those antihistamines would no longer work and I was risking my health. I quit eating seafood and fish completely. My allergy progressed to the point that if fish/seafood touch anything I eat, I go into anaphylaxis. Food allergies are not a joke and you should never play with your health that way. And your sister is an AH because she knew you are allergic.", "I am not a doctor but the following is based on extensive discussions with my childs allergists. Your allergic symptoms involve two body systems: skin (the hives) and digestive system (stomach problems). By the normal criteria for allergy management, this is a systemic reaction. Since it involves hives, it is a systemic reaction that involves IgE. Any systemic IgE reaction can turn into outright anaphylaxis very quickly and can become unrecoverable. Past reaction severity also does not predict severity of future reactions. Anaphylaxis technically is the rapid body decompensation where the body goes into shock. The standard protocol for Laypersons is that we are generally expected to use our EpiPen when we have any systemic reaction, or, any allergic reaction that prevents breathing. Do you have an EpiPen? Why does your allergist not expect you to use it in these situations. \n\nGoing to a restaurant designed around a food to which you are allergic. Did you not ever read about the kid who was allergic to fish walked into his home where his relatives were cooking fish, and died of an allergic reaction despite his epipen being used?\n\nI feel you need to back to your allergist and talk about this more. You should not even be visiting this restaurant let alone eating the food there. It sounds like your sister is not supportive but that ciykd be because you have downplayed the severity of your allergy.", "Did they not know you were allergic or something? NTA either way", "NTA\nYour sister seemed to think only of yourself. You\u2019re diabetic and it\u2019s vital you eat - she knows that! Yet, disagreed that you could bring your own food. She knew you had an allergy to seafood. Your sister is unaware/unaccepting of how much of a selfish jerk she is", "NTA\n\nBut you shouldn't have to live like this. Can your husband help bring you food for things like this?", "If you don't have one, you need to get an epi pen, because one of these days, you will have a worse reaction.\n\nNTA for telling the truth when pressured, but your mom is. And your sister is an AH for telling you it wouldn't be okay to bring your own food.", "NTA, you told her you\u2019d get sick she said \u201cnot THAT sick!\u201d and now she\u2019s mad you said you got sick? Without implicating her? Guilty conscious I perceive.", "Hives and stomach issues including vomiting = early signs of anaphylaxis. If you keep exposing yourself, you may have an anaphylactic reaction involving your breathing. Take your anaphylactic allergy more seriously: get an epi pen, see an allergist (if you haven\u2019t already), and stop exposing yourself to seafood.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. There\u2019s no reason to lie about what happened. You ate seafood and got sick. I\u2019m not really sure why your sister is making a big deal out of it. Just relax, feel better, and eventually she\u2019ll get over herself (hopefully).", "You're NTA. I can't imagine how self centered someone has to be to invite a sibling to a restaurant whose predominant food is something that will cause her to have an allergic reaction. That is an A-H move. \n\n You took the risk, dealt with the consequences, and kept it to yourself until the answer as to why you were sick was dragged out of you.", "Yep.  Sister is a dick.  She couldn't have chosen a restaurant that has seafood and at least one thing safe for OP?  Or been okay with them not going?  Yes, OP should have been an adult and said no...but wow their family sucks ass.", "\"Why would anyone force someone with a seafood allergy to attend a party at a restaurant that only serves seafood?\" They would do that if they were an ass\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* who doesn't care about anybody except themselves.", "because it's not real lol", "Why would anyone with a seafood allergy not be alittle late and pick something up to eat on the way to the party instead of eating stuff that touched seafood?", "Exactly, this is why she took it so personally, she knew exactly how wrong she was in forcing OP to attend and refusing any alternative like OP coming with their own meal.\n\nFor OP's question, of course NTA for just telling the truth, you would have been TA to yourself had you covered up for your sister as it seems your mother would have been mad at you for not coming.\nAnd I get why people say OP was TA to themselves in accepting to go to sister's party on sister's conditions, but honestly from what we read it feels like saying no is hard in OP's family, the sister literally told them \"no you can't bring your own meal, you're gonna find a way to eat somehow before or after my super late-ending party and you're gonna watch all of us eat for my party\". The sister was clearly TA from the beginning to the end of that story. And she obviously knows it.", "I honestly think that the OP treats herself like that because she has been BULLIED (probably for years, since childhood) to prioritise everyone over herself. I bet she was told many times to not \"exaggerate\", \"stop moaning\", \"stop being selfish\", \"think about your sister\" etc. She literally was taught that she and her health is not important, especially when compared to others.", "It's baffling how OP treats themselves, and it's baffling how they let others treat them.", "Is your family unaware of your seafood allergy? Why on earth would they arrange a celebration where you, specifically, can't eat? I've never heard of a \"seafood party\" before, but I'm in the US, so I guess it's a thing there. \n\nDo you guys not have petrol stations/delis that carry foods to grab on the go? The one closest to me has hard boiled eggs, beef jerky, cheese, pre-made sandwiches and wraps, fruit cups, and all manner of protein and energy drinks/bars. Could you truly not have gotten anything from such a place or your home, on your way to the restaurant? *You are a diabetic with allergies who works extended hours!* You should have quick and easy foods well stocked at home, and outside places that offer them mapped in your head as a matter of course!\n\nThis is a tragicomedy of errors leading up to this dumb fight... Why can't you just tell your sister that you weren't making a jab at her? Did I miss the part where you made a post on social media/rented a billboard blasting the cause of your illness, and how it was all your sister's fault? \n\nAs others have said, NTA, for this misunderstanding. But you're definitively TA for not taking better care of yourself,  given your dietary needs and restrictions.", "Don't you see how OP is BULLIED into prioritising her family over her health. For people who are raised like there is no \"other option\". Each of the options you proposed most probably would result in a guilt trip from mum and sister. It is really not that easy to overcome such upbringing, especially if no-one before told you it's not right.", "I\u2019ve had people approach me and ask me if I sometimes just eat stuff I\u2019m allergic to\u2026 cause they saw a TikTok video of someone eating some peanut butter with their epiPen", "They did but it\u2019s all cooked and prepped in the same place so it would have had the same effect due to cross contamination", "My husband was equally busy, I was so preoccupied I couldn\u2019t order during my shift, I have mostly protein bars and juice stashed as a diabetic since they have a longer shelf life and I can carry it anywhere without fear of spoilage.

If she bailed on the day after party, she would be scolded, which happened.\n\nAnd if she starved herself after her 30 hour shift and collapsed at the party she might be blamed for making the party attention about her. It's funny how people make claims about being responsible yourself, taking responsibility for your health and well being, but she was trying to be considerate in a world of her mom and her sister making ridiculous demands (the sister more so). \n\nI think considering the pressure of what her family expected, she tried her best to do what they want, and yes I know that is likely your point that she should have put herself first, but I don't blame her. Family is hard to navigate especially when they expect so much of you and aren't considerate, and for some people just going NC with family that annoys you isn't always an option you want to take, that mindset is so prevalent in Western society that individualistic selfishness and personal consumption has gotten to very extreme levels that aren't always conducive for peace and progression in society.", "Where I live, petrol stations don\u2019t carry such foods and it\u2019s usually deemed to be unhygienic.

A lot of doctors don't think to suggest obvious things like that even when the patient clearly needs it.", "Countries outside the USA have different approaches to EpiPens, probably in part because they are so expensive, and probably also for other reasons that only doctors understand. I know someone in UK with peanut allergy who doesn't have one, and peanut reactions are one of those that can go bad quickly. That said, if you are allergic to a lot of things, seems like you'd be someone who ought to have one.

I start getting wobbly after a 12 hour shift, and running on fumes and just a protein bar, I am going to respectfully take her situation into consideration.\n\nAnd she acknowledges that she's TA to herself. I'm cutting the girl some slack because no one else will. I'm sure this is a learning lesson for her but she doesn't come here asking if she's a TA to herself. She came asking if it was reasonable for her sister to be mad for a perceived insult which OP wasn't giving.\n\nSometimes shit happens, she even said she didn't intend to not eat before the party.\n\nAlso second point, some people in this world would rather put up with their families shit than to go NC, that's a more fulfilling life for them rather than isolation or starting all over, and I'm sure she acknowledges thems the breaks. I doubt she was thinking her sister would take this personally.", "I don't disagree. A lot of people have a hard time setting boundaries.
