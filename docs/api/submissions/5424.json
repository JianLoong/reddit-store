The two of them met when my husband was 16 and from the way they always tell the story, they've been inseparable ever since. Bill is now married and lives nearby with his wife. They announced their pregnancy a while ago and my husband was absolutely overjoyed for them. He would visit at often as he could and it seemed like he was singlehandedly funding the baby's wardrobe and nursery, honestly. \n\nUnfortunately, they suffered a miscarriage just before the six month mark. Bill and his wife were understandably devastated, and so was my husband. I got it - he was watching his best friend go through something unimaginably painful. He was often gone for long periods to time comforting Bill because not only had he suffered this loss, his marriage didn't seem to be holding up very well either. \n\nThe miscarriage occurred at the end of September. Now, this is where I might be a huge asshole, so I'm in desperate need of judgement-- I completely empathize with Bill and his wife still needing time to recover, but my husband is ALSO still acting as if this is fresh. Not just in the way he's still comforting his friend during his free time or excusing himself to take hours long phone calls, but the intensity of his emotions. I caught him crying about a week ago and when I asked him what about, he got angry with me and said it should be obvious. \n\nI was surprised to be met with such malice over a simple question, so I tried to gently suggest that maybe therapy would be beneficial. He was feeling this loss like it was his own, and I didn't find that very healthy. In fact, I had been concerned about him since mid-October if I was honest but had no idea how to broach the subject. The conversation that followed didn't go well, and my husband said his emotions were perfectly normal and that maybe I was just lacking in empathy.

Being empathetic is one thing but this does seem a bit over the top. Either there\u2019s more to this story (and I hope there isn\u2019t) or he does need to speak to a therapist to work out why he is so enmeshed with his friend. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nI think suggesting your husband see a counselor is a good idea. Doesn\u2019t mean his feelings are wrong, but a counselor could help him process what happened.", "NTA. This is very unusual, and your suggestion of therapy is right on. I\u2019d be incredibly surprised if my husband displayed the behavior you describe.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is unusually enmeshed here. Like weirdly so. I don't think his relationship with Bill is entirely platonic.  \n\nHave you seen Bill and his wife recently? If you've been distancing yourself I'd say it's time to go when your husband does so you can judge just how things are between the three of them. Whatever it is that's bothering your husband, it's clear he's grieving much more than a friend's lost baby.", "NTA, are you sure this wasn\u2019t an affair baby your husband fathered?", "NTA. Therapy asap. \n\nYou sure this wasn\u2019t husbands baby? Secret donor? Affair? That does not seem normal.", "NTA, you checked in on him with a simple question and it seemed to have triggered him causing a blow out. While I empathize and respect a sensitive person, it is a bit strange to still be harboring such strong emotions over someone else\u2019s miscarriage. At the end of the day, life goes on, and while it will take longer for bill and his wife to heal from this, I do think it might be time for hubby to talk to a professional about his strong feelings towards this. Best of luck to you OP", "NTA. And you're right, this isn't healthy. It's very odd that bugs so grief stricken over his friend's wife's miscarriage. Even if the friend is close enough to be his brother, it still isn't healthy. It's not normal. Husband seems to be taking it personally, as if he's lost his own child.", "NTA. Doesn't sound like you coldly told him to get over it or something. Everyone deals with emotions differently, but that seems a bit extreme. I don't think you'd be expected that long after to just automatically know why he was crying.", "NTA, your husband's emotions and actions are highly unusual. I don't like asking this but is it possible there's more to the relationship between your husband and Bill than you realise? It all sounds rather a bit odd, taking it far too personally it seems.", "NTA because you were not being a jerk and telling him to get over himself because it wasn't his kid. You expressed a concern for his well being for internalizing his friend's pain so deeply. You offered support in doing so and he took it very badly. I'm not sure what would be helpful honestly.", "NTA. It's a tough one to call but it seems unusual he is taking this so hard. You were right to suggest therapy as maybe there's sth else at play maybe he's not even realising. \nWay more than enough time has passed for this to play out emotionally. Especially for your husband, I'd say.", "NTA. It sounds to me like your husband is over-identifying; as though the miscarriage was his and Bill's.", "NTA and your husband's behavior is a bit weird. He can be upset but crying seems like he was somehow involved in their life somehow or he is 5 years old.", " Plot twist: the nursery was meant to double as a studio in which art could occur. \n\nNTA", "Idk this one is hard. For me NTA. It doesn't sound like you were rude about anything and you tried to communicate with him so for him to get so defensive this really is a difficult one. I think there's also this stigma against therapy when it really could be beneficial. There could be something underlying on top of the miscarriage that is bothering him that he needs to talk through. It's important to note that you are 2 different people that handle your emotions differently so you should not feel bad that you are not as affected by this as he is.", "I'm curious.... Do you and your husband have children? Does he want children?", "NAH - While I get people have different levels of sensitivity, I'd be pretty positive this is not a healthy reaction after this much time when your not the one who has suffered the loss directly, and you'd know better than anyone whether your husband should be reacting THIS severely to the loss. Sounds like you approached it as well as you could and your husband needs to talk to someone", "NTA, but at six months that\u2019s not a miscarriage that\u2019s a stillbirth. Which may explain why your husband is so emotional. I do agree suggesting therapy may be a good idea, he seems overly distraught over a baby that wasn\u2019t his.", "NTA. \n\nHis reaction to you reaching out to him was oddly defensive. That part in particular, I do not find \u2018normal\u2019. Not to rot your brain with what may be a ludicrous idea, is it possible that your husband is much closer to either his friend Bill, or Bill\u2019s wife, than you may know? \n\nFor what it is worth, I would feel exactly the way you do. You are not an asshole for having feelings.", "NTA. Maybe he wasn't the father, but could your husband be in a relationship with them? I know that sounds really out there. I just can't imagine why he is taking it so hard. I understand his friend and the wife are still grieving, but your husband grieving like this seems so off.", "Hey OP, you are the spare (not even third) wheel in this weird tango. Hubby and Bill are a couple, bill\u2019s wife is a surrogate in all but name and you are being taken for a ride here. Open your eyes and ears and smell the bullshit. NTA", "NTA, based upon the info as presented. I consider my personal level of empathy to be low-normal and your husband\u2019s reaction does seem over the top to me. My advice is to consider the relationship of the two friends and also your husband\u2019s level of empathy/emotions, in general. How does current day compare to pre-tragedy?", "NAH. Your husband should see a therapist. He is clearly going through the grieving process, and you are not qualified to help him through that.", "NAH. I lost my baby in March few days before she was supposed to be born. That was 9 months ago and I have friends who still cry over my loss, my baby, and me  - because they wanted to meet her and looking forward to being part of her life. They are so sad and we didn't even get to meet when I was pregnant since I was in a different country. So I can only imagine how your husband feels as he saw the experience firsthand.\n\nYour husband needs to see a grief therapist though for him to understand how and why he is this affected. Did their loss make him scared that things like this happen and made him worried/anxious about your future family? Or did he already want a child that made him excited for his friend's baby?\n\nBtw, around the 6-month mark is already a stillbirth and not a miscarriage.", "NTA- if he is this raw he may actually be harmful to his friends.   People grieve in their own way, and time- but having someone constantly bring it up to them has to be harder.", "I think NTA. You have a right to be concerned. I would be if my husband was this distraught over a miscarriage that wasn\u2019t ours. I understand being supportive of his friend and helping him process but there\u2019s no need for to snap at you when you asked why he was crying. He could use so grief counseling or maybe just regular therapy to work out why he feels so strongly about this.", "Nta for me. He needs therapy this isnt normal imo. Maybe if it was his kid or grandkid but it wasnt SIDS or anything the baby wasnt born yet. The fact he isnt even getting a little better in months is weird", "INFO: \n1. you say that you \"caught him crying\"; can you say a little more? Was he trying to conceal that he was crying? The reason I ask is because he might not have had an opportunity yet to express his grief in a way that was met with the support he needed in order to process it. This could be part of why it's taking so long; he might be attempting to repress it, only resulting drawing it out longer. \n\n2. You say you asked him what about. How would you describe your body language and availability in that moment? What was on your mind? \n\nMy intuition is saying NAH. Perhaps a sensitive guy and deeply connected friends. Perhaps an emotional investment and grief that is taking your husband as much by surprise as you. Perhaps a concerned partner (you) who is out of their depth and grasping for support.", "NTA.

As someone else suggested, was your husband possible involved as a sperm donor? It seems very odd to have been that involved and later distressed personally.\n\nMaybe Bill has fertility issues and wanted your husband involved. Also, you don't mention if you have kids, this may have been your husband's way of a surrogate child and wanting to expand your own family.\n\nWhile it's been a couple of months, it also was leading into the holiday time and may have been extra distressing to everyone involved for what they intended for what sounds like it would have been a December birth.", "I think he's overreacting.

I just don\u2019t think that you can relate, and for many people, it\u2019s hard to feel empathetic about something if you\u2019ve never been through it yourself.

It\u2019s difficult for me not to sense or feel the emotional pain of others around me.\n\nI do not think you are a bad person whatsoever, and I think it\u2019s great that you suggested therapy to help, but you should work on trying to be more comforting of the obvious heartbreak your husband feels.\n\nNAH.", "Sometimes/some people feel things more deeply.

'Excessive' may not sit well for most, but it is indeeed slightly unusual (but not impossible nor improbable) for someone to take news like this so intensely outside of the parents.  It's definitely a sad situation that I wish those involved didn't have to endure.  \n\nHonestly though I have never dealt with this type of situation.

Losing a child is not something one just gets over even if you aren\u2019t the parent. Your husband was super excited about this new life and all that could be, he was out buying stuff and helping them prepare. He became attached. It\u2019s normal to grieve.", "I'm leaning towards NAH. As many have suggested, might there be something you're unaware of driving your husband's reaction? I'm wondering if it's possible he's gone through this himself with a previous SO, and Bill's wife's miscarriage is bringing up painful memories. \n\nEven if this were the case, I say neither of you are an AH because he should, ideally, be discussing this with you. You're his wife, and open communication is foundational to a healthy marital relationship. Whatever is going on, I hope your husband decides to share why he feels this so deeply.\n\nAs an end note: I do not fault anyone for feeling emotions deeply. There is nothing inherently wrong with strong emotions, but those of us who feel them may do ourselves and others a disservice when not examining and explaining why we feel as deeply as we do.

He might unconciously share your view that it's not healthy. He might be so defensive and blaming you for judging him even though just as much or more judgement is coming from within. This could compound his feelings and result in his being stuck in the pain and loss. \n\nThe end of September is not that long ago if we think of the parents' experience. He is very involved in his friend's life, and a six-month miscarriage is a very significant loss for the parents. Also, the due date would have been sometime soon.

Christmas, too, depending on their traditions. \n\nIf your husband is uninterested in therapy, it might still really help all of you, and your marriage, if you go on your own.
