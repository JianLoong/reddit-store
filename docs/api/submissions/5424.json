He would visit at often as he could and it seemed like he was singlehandedly funding the baby's wardrobe and nursery, honestly. \n\nUnfortunately, they suffered a miscarriage just before the six month mark. Bill and his wife were understandably devastated, and so was my husband. I got it - he was watching his best friend go through something unimaginably painful. He was often gone for long periods to time comforting Bill because not only had he suffered this loss, his marriage didn't seem to be holding up very well either. \n\nThe miscarriage occurred at the end of September. Now, this is where I might be a huge asshole, so I'm in desperate need of judgement-- I completely empathize with Bill and his wife still needing time to recover, but my husband is ALSO still acting as if this is fresh. Not just in the way he's still comforting his friend during his free time or excusing himself to take hours long phone calls, but the intensity of his emotions. I caught him crying about a week ago and when I asked him what about, he got angry with me and said it should be obvious. \n\nI was surprised to be met with such malice over a simple question, so I tried to gently suggest that maybe therapy would be beneficial. He was feeling this loss like it was his own, and I didn't find that very healthy. In fact, I had been concerned about him since mid-October if I was honest but had no idea how to broach the subject.

Being empathetic is one thing but this does seem a bit over the top. Either there\u2019s more to this story (and I hope there isn\u2019t) or he does need to speak to a therapist to work out why he is so enmeshed with his friend. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nI think suggesting your husband see a counselor is a good idea. Doesn\u2019t mean his feelings are wrong, but a counselor could help him process what happened.", "NTA. This is very unusual, and your suggestion of therapy is right on. I\u2019d be incredibly surprised if my husband displayed the behavior you describe.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is unusually enmeshed here. Like weirdly so. I don't think his relationship with Bill is entirely platonic.  \n\nHave you seen Bill and his wife recently? If you've been distancing yourself I'd say it's time to go when your husband does so you can judge just how things are between the three of them. Whatever it is that's bothering your husband, it's clear he's grieving much more than a friend's lost baby.", "NTA, are you sure this wasn\u2019t an affair baby your husband fathered?", "NTA. Therapy asap. \n\nYou sure this wasn\u2019t husbands baby? Secret donor? Affair? That does not seem normal.", "NTA, you checked in on him with a simple question and it seemed to have triggered him causing a blow out. While I empathize and respect a sensitive person, it is a bit strange to still be harboring such strong emotions over someone else\u2019s miscarriage. At the end of the day, life goes on, and while it will take longer for bill and his wife to heal from this, I do think it might be time for hubby to talk to a professional about his strong feelings towards this. Best of luck to you OP", "NTA. And you're right, this isn't healthy. It's very odd that bugs so grief stricken over his friend's wife's miscarriage. Even if the friend is close enough to be his brother, it still isn't healthy. It's not normal. Husband seems to be taking it personally, as if he's lost his own child.", "NTA. Doesn't sound like you coldly told him to get over it or something. Everyone deals with emotions differently, but that seems a bit extreme. I don't think you'd be expected that long after to just automatically know why he was crying.", "NTA, your husband's emotions and actions are highly unusual. I don't like asking this but is it possible there's more to the relationship between your husband and Bill than you realise? It all sounds rather a bit odd, taking it far too personally it seems.", "NTA because you were not being a jerk and telling him to get over himself because it wasn't his kid. You expressed a concern for his well being for internalizing his friend's pain so deeply. You offered support in doing so and he took it very badly. I'm not sure what would be helpful honestly.", "NTA. It's a tough one to call but it seems unusual he is taking this so hard. You were right to suggest therapy as maybe there's sth else at play maybe he's not even realising. \nWay more than enough time has passed for this to play out emotionally. Especially for your husband, I'd say.", "NTA. It sounds to me like your husband is over-identifying; as though the miscarriage was his and Bill's.", "NTA and your husband's behavior is a bit weird. He can be upset but crying seems like he was somehow involved in their life somehow or he is 5 years old.", "[removed]", "Idk this one is hard. For me NTA. It doesn't sound like you were rude about anything and you tried to communicate with him so for him to get so defensive this really is a difficult one. I think there's also this stigma against therapy when it really could be beneficial. There could be something underlying on top of the miscarriage that is bothering him that he needs to talk through. It's important to note that you are 2 different people that handle your emotions differently so you should not feel bad that you are not as affected by this as he is.", "I'm curious.... Do you and your husband have children? Does he want children?", "NAH - While I get people have different levels of sensitivity, I'd be pretty positive this is not a healthy reaction after this much time when your not the one who has suffered the loss directly, and you'd know better than anyone whether your husband should be reacting THIS severely to the loss. Sounds like you approached it as well as you could and your husband needs to talk to someone", "NTA, but at six months that\u2019s not a miscarriage that\u2019s a stillbirth. Which may explain why your husband is so emotional. I do agree suggesting therapy may be a good idea, he seems overly distraught over a baby that wasn\u2019t his.", "NTA. \n\nHis reaction to you reaching out to him was oddly defensive. That part in particular, I do not find \u2018normal\u2019. Not to rot your brain with what may be a ludicrous idea, is it possible that your husband is much closer to either his friend Bill, or Bill\u2019s wife, than you may know? \n\nFor what it is worth, I would feel exactly the way you do. You are not an asshole for having feelings.", "NTA. Maybe he wasn't the father, but could your husband be in a relationship with them? I know that sounds really out there. I just can't imagine why he is taking it so hard. I understand his friend and the wife are still grieving, but your husband grieving like this seems so off.", "Hey OP, you are the spare (not even third) wheel in this weird tango. Hubby and Bill are a couple, bill\u2019s wife is a surrogate in all but name and you are being taken for a ride here. Open your eyes and ears and smell the bullshit. NTA", "NTA, based upon the info as presented. I consider my personal level of empathy to be low-normal and your husband\u2019s reaction does seem over the top to me. My advice is to consider the relationship of the two friends and also your husband\u2019s level of empathy/emotions, in general. How does current day compare to pre-tragedy?", "NAH. Your husband should see a therapist. He is clearly going through the grieving process, and you are not qualified to help him through that.", "NAH. I lost my baby in March few days before she was supposed to be born. That was 9 months ago and I have friends who still cry over my loss, my baby, and me  - because they wanted to meet her and looking forward to being part of her life. They are so sad and we didn't even get to meet when I was pregnant since I was in a different country. So I can only imagine how your husband feels as he saw the experience firsthand.\n\nYour husband needs to see a grief therapist though for him to understand how and why he is this affected. Did their loss make him scared that things like this happen and made him worried/anxious about your future family? Or did he already want a child that made him excited for his friend's baby?\n\nBtw, around the 6-month mark is already a stillbirth and not a miscarriage.", "NTA- if he is this raw he may actually be harmful to his friends.   People grieve in their own way, and time- but having someone constantly bring it up to them has to be harder.", "I think NTA. You have a right to be concerned. I would be if my husband was this distraught over a miscarriage that wasn\u2019t ours. I understand being supportive of his friend and helping him process but there\u2019s no need for to snap at you when you asked why he was crying. He could use so grief counseling or maybe just regular therapy to work out why he feels so strongly about this.", "Nta for me. He needs therapy this isnt normal imo. Maybe if it was his kid or grandkid but it wasnt SIDS or anything the baby wasnt born yet. The fact he isnt even getting a little better in months is weird", "INFO: \n1. you say that you \"caught him crying\"; can you say a little more? Was he trying to conceal that he was crying? The reason I ask is because he might not have had an opportunity yet to express his grief in a way that was met with the support he needed in order to process it. This could be part of why it's taking so long; he might be attempting to repress it, only resulting drawing it out longer. \n\n2. You say you asked him what about. How would you describe your body language and availability in that moment? What was on your mind? \n\nMy intuition is saying NAH. Perhaps a sensitive guy and deeply connected friends. Perhaps an emotional investment and grief that is taking your husband as much by surprise as you. Perhaps a concerned partner (you) who is out of their depth and grasping for support.", "NTA.

He could\u2019ve been crying about stubbing his toe right then for all you know, or a dead raccoon on the side of the road. \n\nBut I do think you need to look at this from a different angle. They likely had a name or names period picked out. They probably decided on a crib, it might even have been bought by then. The registry was probably finished a while ago, and if mom or dad were taking paternity leave that\u2019s been long settled. A baby shower was probably in the works or already planned. Your husbands probably been called uncle *and* called himself uncle already *a lot*. Everyone involved with the baby and mom and da directly has already fundamentally shifted in what they considered a permanent way for months now. But what they\u2019ve been waiting for for close to half a year is hollow and gone. \n\nEvery wanted baby that a parent loses is hard, but to lose your child so far in, when you have to go through labor knowing there\u2019s no happy ending, there is just something different about it. The baby was *real* to not just the parents but also your husband. And it\u2019s actually kind of normal for him to still cry about it three months later. If my best friend lost a child like that, I think I would be crying off and on for a few months too. Edit: I actually have a few pregnant friends (baby boom I SWEAR TO YOU), one whom is my absolute best friend, and they just hit seven months. I\u2019m crying right now thinking about the possibility of my niece dying. I\u2019m prepared to love her like she\u2019s my own flesh and blood for the rest of my days. I would be devastated. \n\nI also think therapy would be beneficial to your husband after all this; still borns are hard, even on the family. He needs therapy in general for this rough shit and his rough handling of it, but I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s unnatural either. This was a death for mom and dad and those closest to them, and your husband by all accounts was closest.\n\nEdit to add again: I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s that weird that OP\u2019s husband is still crying over this stillbirth. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s too meshed with his best friend because he loved the baby. That\u2019s his best friend, probably feels more like his brother after all this time. My best friend is the closest thing I have to a sister. I\u2019m already Aunt RiByrne. That means that every time we talk, we talk about her pregnancy and the baby. It\u2019s not *all* we talk about, and I still have plenty of time to tell her about my stuff, but because her life is preparing for a baby, it means I\u2019m putting in slightly more time with her. It means I send Amazon gifts to her house twice just because I wanted to, because I love her and her expanding family and I\u2019m still gonna buy separate stuff to give both her and her husband for the actual shower. This will be my nibling. I go to the bulk store she likes with her because her husband works third shift and sleeps during the day and she can\u2019t lift stuff anymore. I get it into her car from the store, and he gets it out. Besides her husbands mom and her grandma, I\u2019m usually the first to know any updates or see the ultra sounds. Just like all the crazy stuff in her life I\u2019ve slightly held her hand for and stood by her, given extra help and love during, Im doing so during an impending child. This isn\u2019t her being entitled to my time or money, nor me being too involved, this is just how *families* work when they love each other and want to genuinely support each other. I don\u2019t just love my best friend, I love my best friends baby. She\u2019s a living piece of one of my favorite people in the world. Because I know I love my best friend the same way I love my actual brother, I know I will love her baby the same way I\u2019d love his child, one that would share my actual blood. I love her because she\u2019s my niece. I love her as an actual person, already. She\u2019s not here yet, but she\u2019s already my family. \n\nI feel like a broken record, and I\u2019m probably way too close but I don\u2019t think there are any assholes here because I don\u2019t know that you\u2019re seeing the full picture here, OP, and I don\u2019t think that makes you an AH, or your husband one either. I think that just means there\u2019s a disconnect.\n\nThis was a stillbirth. When people grieve death of a family member, especially a baby this is what happens. I\u2019m my best friends family in the way Op makes it seem like her husband is Bill\u2019s. And if her baby died just a month ago and she had to deliver it like normal, I wouldn\u2019t be okay. A brother could have done all that and cried three months later about it and I don\u2019t see how people would find that weird of an excited and then devastated uncle to do.

You have to go through the *whole birthing experience* to produce a tiny little corpse. No joyful cry at the end of it, no lovely snuggles. \nThey've been friends for nearly half your husband's life, that kid was probably going to be your god child. \n\nYou don't \"get over\" the death of a child, you just learn to live with it and let the wound become a scab, then a scar. Eventually you'll wake up and the first thought will not be about the child you lost. Eventually you'll have a full day where you don't think about the child you lost. That doesn't happen over night. It doesn't happen over three months, or years. The timeline is different for everyone. Your husband is being a supportive friend for his best friend as well as mourning the loss of his godchild - where have you been in all this? I see no mention of how you have been supporting him during this time?", "In my experience, the level of grief people go through with regards to miscarriage is directly related to the level of expectation that person had around the meaning of the introduction of this new potential child into their lives. Your husband is grieving for two things in this instance: the loss of an idealised potential future that he has clearly envisioned and is struggling to let go of, as well as the loss of his good friend's happiness and relationship stability. Quite often it is the abject *helplessness* we experience when our loved ones go through grief which also entangles us in *their* grief. \n\nI think what you've done here is isolate yourself from the grief process unintentionally, which is causing your husband to become more enmeshed in his friends grief because he doesn't have a safe space to articulate those emotions with you and lean on *you* for support, so he's moved beyond empathy into sympathy (meaning he's got drawn into the grief cycle with his friend). This inhibits his ability to be a good support for his friend because the really important thing as the support person is to be *stable* something he can't do in this circumstance. \n\nIdeally, you'd be supporting his friend and his wife *as a couple*. Take food, listen, talk, invite them out somewhere for a break from cycling in misery. No one has to \"get over it\" in a particular timeframe, but the idea is that they develop better and better strategies to assist them with dealing with loss. Your husband isn't actually much good to his friend if what he is doing is just cycling through the intense part of the grief process with him. Also, a couple who have lost a pregnancy need to lean on *each other* in this and your husband might fundamentally need to back off so this couple can do that. He might be an easier person for his friend to talk to, but that vulnerability is something his friend should be trusting his wife with. \n\nUltimately, I think NAH, but something sounds a bit unhealthy. For the sake of *both* your marriages, I think you should be learning to support each other. You haven't said anything about your relationship with his wife, but perhaps she could use a cup of tea and a chat? I think it would be better if supporting his friends was more of a team effort between you.", "NTA. Something is going on that is not \"normal.\" He should see a therapist.", "NTA\n\nNope.

I am betting that your spouse was a donor and didn't tell you.", "NTA, you seem well-intentioned. A lot can get lost in translation when grief is at the forefront of someone's mind and emotions. Perhaps it would be useful to write him a card, explaining how you understand that this has been a hugely emotional time for him and you're simply not sure if you are being or how to be of support to him, clarifying that's why you suggested therapy so he has a space of support and you're happy to go with him if helpful so you can better understand what this all means to him and how his processing works.\n\nTherapy isn't necessarily just for those with a diagnosed mental health condition, etc. It's there as a support place to process emotion and life changes for those directly going them, or those supporting those who are, because that can be I credibly draining in and of itself.\n\nGood luck OP", "IDT either of you are the AH.  Every person on the planet handles grief differently. Certain things affect certain people differently. It may seem odd to you that he is taking this so hard, but like someone said above. Giving birth to a corpse can absolutely WRECK a person/family. It is awful. I couldn\u2019t imagine the pain, and emptiness. So I\u2019m sure your husbands friend is really going through it\u2026 and seeing someone you care for deeply in so much pain makes you feel pain. So I would bet his friend is a wreck a lot of the time. Or at least when he talks to your husband. But it is good to have someone to talk to. He may not have anyone else other than his wife. Also, there is not a time limit on how long/short that pain will last. So my advice would be try and talk to your husband about it a little more. Like really listen. Is his friends sadness 100% from the loss of their baby, or is some of it from the marriage being on the rocks?  A mix of both?

It\u2019s a stillbirth. At 6 months the wife probably had to be induced and go through labor to give birth to a DEAD BABY.

When my husband\u2019s good friend lost a baby that way they shared the pics with us\u2014 she was a beautiful baby but you could tell she wasn\u2019t alive as her skin was blue. I am tearing up as I type this and this happened over a year ago. Maybe Bill shared the pics with OP\u2019s husband. It can be hard to forget something so tragic.", "Everyone is different.

Something weird about that", "That's exactly what I thought that he seems to be more invested then just being a good friend. There's sympathy and then there is grief, he seems to have more personal grief then just sympathizes with his friends!\n\nI am also wondering if he had an affair with his buddies wife and the two of them know that the baby was actually his not his buddy's. That would explain him feeling more like it's his child he lost rather then his friends loss.", "Yep, at that point, you\u2019re holding a dead baby who has been carefully wrapped in blankets by the nurses so you can have a chance to say goodbye.", "I'm thinking the same thing, if they are that close as friends, i'd imagine the husband is very emotionally invested in the child, was probably going to be godfather and was looking forward to being part of their lives.  Everyones grief is different.", "Dude\u2026 my husband\u2019s close male friend lost a baby to stillbirth and we both cried about it for MONTHS. OP is being bizarrely obtuse. Losing a baby is unbelievably tragic, and OP\u2019s husband is having a normal, empathetic reaction to a devastating loss experienced by a close friend.", "If all men had a deep emotional attachment to their best friends this patriarchal world would be a much better place for all of us.", "The conspiracy theories here are just wild. There could be any number of reasons to explain the husband's extreme grief without jumping to secret gay affair. Maybe he and OP have decided they aren't ready for kids, but he actually really wants one and has been living vicariously through the friend. Maybe he was promised a role of 'uncle' and felt connected to the baby that way. Maybe he is undergoing some mental health struggles and this event has been a catalyst of sorts. You cant internet sleuth your way to an answer.\n\nI absolutely agree his reaction isn't normal and therapy would be beneficial - but it sounds like he might not be easily convinced of this fact. I think the best OP can do is express their concern gently and with love, and try to keep therapy on the table as a way for husband to work through things without judgement.", "Yes. This is the first thought for me. Bill and op\u2019s husband lost their baby.", "That was a HUGE leap Nickie. But entirely possible.", "I'd say your husband has been very emotionally invested in the pregnancy through his friend, and maybe had an idea that he would be a part of the childs life, probably godfather, the \"uncle\" in his dream where he would be doing the christmas and birthday thing.  You didn't mention if you have kids, so maybe its a proxy thing he wanted, and now its gone, he's hurting and his friend is grieving. At 24 weeks, thats a big shock and it's not really a miscarriage, it's a death in their family and by extension his.\n\nIts also possible it has triggered some kind of emotional event form his childhood that he has never discussed.  Men are odd that way, myself, i've always been pretty controlled and not had much contact with death and grief, i had a sister who was stillborn before i was born, i don't even know about her until i was 13, and my family don't really bring it up, but there was a re-internment of babies in the cemetry where she is buried there was no markers for the graves there inititally, that i'd never visited and i had passed a bit for work, one day, i just decided to go in and have a look, and it jsut hit me like a ton of bricks, that i had a sister there that i'd never really acknowledged, and it really effected me for weeks afterwards,  When we had our first baby, i had a similar reaction and i was a bit of an emotional mess for a few weeks, and i actually went and talked to somebody about it.\n\nI think what your husband really needs, is a hug and to be able to let it out with you, maybe see someone, it might seem silly or off to you, but you are not in his head, and he needs to be understood on this and it acknowledged as being a shit situation.", "Sounds like they are probably nearing the due date from the timeline as well.", ">if so, he maybe should have discussed it with his wife\n\nMaybe???", "No you don't understand! Two men can't be close without also being gay! It's the law", "I can't remember the details but there was a post a while ago about a guy who basically put his friend first and it was someone he hadn't met too long ago if I remember right. I think the guy ended up turning an extra area in the house into an a place where art would occur (apparently using the actual name for such a place is a no no as my comment got removed) for his new friend to enjoy as well and his wife didn\u2019t approve of what he did to the room.

To be that involved in the nursery is inappropriate, as that is something the parents should be bonding over doing.\n\nWith a divorce looming, I can see where he wants to be supportive of his friend. Plus, his friend may have some guilt over a pending divorce while losing a child. \n\nI suggest being supportive and give him time.

His depression got even more severe in the months that followed, even as my husband and I started to heal, and I have no doubt our son's passing was part of the reason why. \n\nNAH, and anyone who thinks there is hasn't dealt with a stillbirth or the death of an infant in their close circle.", "You're not into jumping to conclusions but came up with this? That's wild.", "This was the first thing that crossed my mind by the time i got to the end of it.", "Yo wtf, he can't have an over the top emotional reaction to something his friend is going through without it being gay?", "What is it with these comments?", "Also, it's Christmas in a few days (assuming they celebrate it). I can't imagine celebrating Christmas knowing that it *should* have been my best friend's baby's first Christmas, but instead the baby is dead. This is a perfectly normal time of year for grief to suddenly rear its head again as people remember who they aren't celebrating with.", "Also, their baby died just before the six month mark in **September** - which means the baby would\u2019ve been due this month, so this very raw loss is compounded by the missed milestones - the birth, baby\u2019s first Christmas, first Santa pics, etc., at a time of year associated with family. They will feel this pain for the rest of their lives. Bill and his wife must feel just so devastated, and OP acknowledges that it\u2019s impacted their marriage. OP\u2019s husband is probably one of the few people Bill is able to open up to, and rather than burden Bill with his own grief, husband has brought it home to deal with. Except his wife just wants him to \u201cget over it\u201d.  Nice. \n\nLet me ask you this OP: if you had experienced such a profound loss - a child, or a parent, or a best friend - would you want your friends to just \u201cget over it\u201d and leave you to your grief? Or would you want their compassion and empathy in your darkest hour? Your husband sounds like a good man, able to feel his emotions and offer his love and support to his friends. Your reaction is the equivalent of telling a young child who\u2019s upset to shut up because \u201cboys don\u2019t cry\u201d. Nurture his empathy, and be there for him.", "OP isn\u2019t expecting everything to be back to normal and is supporting her husband. Suggesting therapy to someone that is clearly struggling doesn\u2019t make her an AH. BFFR.", "I don't think your husband and Bill are having an affair. However, and I say this lightly, do you think it's possible that your husband and Bill's *wife* could possibly be having an affair, the child was actually his, and that's why he's so emotionally devastated? I.e., he's dealing with the stillbirth of his *own* child.", "Ever since that one post everyone is always jumping to this conclusion and I\u2019m honestly so sick of it", "Does saying a-r-t studio get your comment removed??? I have never seen a rule like that.", "That\u2019s still not normal. He needs therapy ASAP if he sees someone else\u2019s baby as his own.", "Yes but for your grief over someone else\u2019s baby to be so extreme that you\u2019re neglecting your own wife, that\u2019s not okay.", "I thought that was \"sperm donor\" *wink wink*\n\nHe wouldn't consult that with his wife.", "riiiiiight. uh huh. and there's no reason why we got Jerry Springer having a whole damn show about this.", "I think he has been on the DL with the friend since they were 16.", "theeeeere it is. Its not a true AITA post without baselessly accusing the man of infidelity! \n\nthere is [zero reason](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt6i5r/aita_for_saying_that_my_husbands_reaction_to_a/j1c75kz/) to assume that this is because of an affair or sperm donation. he's just developed an unhealthy attachment to his lifelong friend.", "They love it \n(I don\u2019t believe this story is real because the writing style reminds me of a similar stories on here, to similar and it\u2019s always throwaway accounts with no other post history but they eat it up)\n\nEspecially since this person doesn\u2019t know the difference between a miscarriage and stillborn.", "Are you talking about the husband and Bill being secret gay lovers? If so, then yeah I thought that was a bit of an overreach. However, thinking that the husband and Bill's wife might be secretly having an affair is definitely not an overreach, IMO. It would perfectly explain why the husband is so invested in/devastated by the miscarriage.", "It's also probably getting very close to the baby's original due date, which will trigger a fresh wave in emotion for many people after a stillbirth or infant death.", "I love how you state the conspiracy theories are wild, then offer up your own  alternative 3 reasons it COULD be, then put the cherry on top with\n\"You cant internet sleuth your way to an answer.\" lol\n\nIt IS unusual and the Op has cause for concern", "In fairness it feels less wild when you've read so many stories on here where similarly odd behaviour turned out to be a secret affair between men. But yeah there are definitely other plausible explanations.", "Yea these theories are wild! He just seems like he\u2019s having trouble managing his emotions. It\u2019s no affair with either part of the married couple or whatever wild theory. I wonder if this is his first experience with major loss.", "I was thinking \"codependent friendship,\" not affair. The age difference (they met when Bill was 20 and husband was 16) nags at me- what 20 year old hangs old with a 16 year old who's not a childhood friend or a relative? I'm sure they exist, it just strikes me as odd.\n\nI'm incredibly curious as to what Bill's wife thinks of OP's husband's reaction to the miscarriage. And Bill- is *Bill* as attached to the husband as the husband is to him? If the situation were reversed, would Bill have been over at OP's house spending money on the baby? Would Bill be grieving months after the miscarriage?", "It also occurred to me, along the lines of mental health struggles, that maybe he has some sort of miscarriage-related trauma and this is bringing up some bad memories.", "I'm glad I'm not the only one that caught that. States they don't jump to conclusions then just straight up threw themselves into the damn void!", "As someone who lost a baby to stillbirth, I just want to say thank you for being such an empathetic friend to your friends. I\u2019m certain that the fact that you remember, grieve and love their child with them is a source of immense, immense comfort to them. My friends still help me throw a birthday party for my baby girl every year, and it\u2019s a joyful celebration of her existence.", "Ok, I lost a child at 26 weeks and there\u2019s no way any of our friends were crying about it 3 months later. My husband and I did, especially as the due date came and went, but then the only dates were got really upset were on the anniversaries of the day of death and due date. He was baby no 3 though, so perhaps our other 2 children kept us occupied.   \nTo be upset for a month of so is fine, for it NOT to be your child and crying 2-3 months later is definitely weird. He needs therapy.", "It also would be getting close to the original due date.", "Wow\u2014 that\u2019s a really important observation, that the baby would have been born in Dec. I didn\u2019t even think of that.", "Lol Brokeback Mountain. I was waiting for someone to suggest a relationship between hubs and Bill but did not think it'd come in the form of \"Brokeback Mountain.\" But yes I agree, something is... off.", "But it could possibly be the closest he could have to \"his own kid\", especially if OP's husband is also an only child and there's no other children to close friends and/or family that he could pour his love towards. I agree that it's not normal but it still would explain his behavior and deep hurt, and he without a doubt needs to see a professional about this regardless.", "All of this 1000%", "Yeah exactly, direct donation.", "I thought so too. He was the old-school kind of donor.", "well you see _technically_ you aren't legally required to notify your wife, \n\nso some bozo on here will argue that it's completely fine to do that and not discuss it with your life partner", "Don\u2019t know about this person but in Aus we generally say \u201caw well MAYBE you should\u2019ve done xyz\u201d the maybe isn\u2019t literal as much as it\u2019s said sarcastically or with an attitude", "I was thinking this too, but I sure hope not.

Still reaching.", "Probably 3 months (October, November and most of December plus part of September). Just too long for a friends kid. \n\nAnd yes, I wasnt crying 3 months later after my wife miscarried. I was still grieving but not as bad as OP's wife seems to be. I will point out though that i had a very bad upbringing so am not usually very emotional as a result of the complex PTSD.", "Lmao the first thing my ex asked me when I told him I miscarried our baby at 5 months was when can we have sex again? So you\u2019re not cold at all", "Maybe the OP\u2019s husband and the friend\u2019s wife were engaged in an elaborate plot to disappear and start a new life on a remote island, and having a baby to sell was essential to the plan.   \nOr maybe the OP\u2019s husbands friend was secretly engineering a new race of super humans and OP\u2019s husband was the primary investor. This was a setback for their venture.\n\nIt coukd be a lot of thing.", "No, their point is \"there are lots of NOT crazy things it could be\". They're not saying those are the answer, they're saying assuming it's some crazy conspiracy thing is more ridiculous than just assuming it's a myriad of normal, reasonable shit.", "What he suggested is much more plausible that those theories about how they are gay lovers and the baby was actually OP's through insemination and they were going to run away together when the baby was born. \nOne thing is to draw a hypothesis from the facts, another is to jump to wild conclusions based on little to nothing.", "In what world is 20 and 16 a weird age gap for a friendship??
