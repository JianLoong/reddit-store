Now, this is where I might be a huge asshole, so I'm in desperate need of judgement-- I completely empathize with Bill and his wife still needing time to recover, but my husband is ALSO still acting as if this is fresh.

Being empathetic is one thing but this does seem a bit over the top. Either there\u2019s more to this story (and I hope there isn\u2019t) or he does need to speak to a therapist to work out why he is so enmeshed with his friend. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nI think suggesting your husband see a counselor is a good idea. Doesn\u2019t mean his feelings are wrong, but a counselor could help him process what happened.", "NTA. This is very unusual, and your suggestion of therapy is right on. I\u2019d be incredibly surprised if my husband displayed the behavior you describe.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is unusually enmeshed here. Like weirdly so. I don't think his relationship with Bill is entirely platonic.  \n\nHave you seen Bill and his wife recently? If you've been distancing yourself I'd say it's time to go when your husband does so you can judge just how things are between the three of them. Whatever it is that's bothering your husband, it's clear he's grieving much more than a friend's lost baby.", "NTA, are you sure this wasn\u2019t an affair baby your husband fathered?", "NTA. Therapy asap. \n\nYou sure this wasn\u2019t husbands baby? Secret donor? Affair? That does not seem normal.", "NTA, you checked in on him with a simple question and it seemed to have triggered him causing a blow out. While I empathize and respect a sensitive person, it is a bit strange to still be harboring such strong emotions over someone else\u2019s miscarriage. At the end of the day, life goes on, and while it will take longer for bill and his wife to heal from this, I do think it might be time for hubby to talk to a professional about his strong feelings towards this. Best of luck to you OP\n\nEdit: it would be a stillbirth, not a miscarriage that late into the pregnancy. My mistake", "NTA. And you're right, this isn't healthy. It's very odd that bugs (edited to hubs) is so grief stricken over his friend's wife's miscarriage. Even if the friend is close enough to be his brother, it still isn't healthy. It's not normal. Husband seems to be taking it personally, as if he's lost his own child.", "NTA. Doesn't sound like you coldly told him to get over it or something. Everyone deals with emotions differently, but that seems a bit extreme. I don't think you'd be expected that long after to just automatically know why he was crying.", "NTA, your husband's emotions and actions are highly unusual. I don't like asking this but is it possible there's more to the relationship between your husband and Bill than you realise? It all sounds rather a bit odd, taking it far too personally it seems.", "NTA because you were not being a jerk and telling him to get over himself because it wasn't his kid. You expressed a concern for his well being for internalizing his friend's pain so deeply. You offered support in doing so and he took it very badly. I'm not sure what would be helpful honestly.", "NTA. It's a tough one to call but it seems unusual he is taking this so hard. You were right to suggest therapy as maybe there's sth else at play maybe he's not even realising. \nWay more than enough time has passed for this to play out emotionally. Especially for your husband, I'd say.", "NTA. It sounds to me like your husband is over-identifying; as though the miscarriage was his and Bill's.", "NTA and your husband's behavior is a bit weird. He can be upset but crying seems like he was somehow involved in their life somehow or he is 5 years old.", "[removed]", "Idk this one is hard. For me NTA. It doesn't sound like you were rude about anything and you tried to communicate with him so for him to get so defensive this really is a difficult one. I think there's also this stigma against therapy when it really could be beneficial. There could be something underlying on top of the miscarriage that is bothering him that he needs to talk through. It's important to note that you are 2 different people that handle your emotions differently so you should not feel bad that you are not as affected by this as he is.", "I'm curious.... Do you and your husband have children? Does he want children?", "NAH - While I get people have different levels of sensitivity, I'd be pretty positive this is not a healthy reaction after this much time when your not the one who has suffered the loss directly, and you'd know better than anyone whether your husband should be reacting THIS severely to the loss. Sounds like you approached it as well as you could and your husband needs to talk to someone", "NTA, but at six months that\u2019s not a miscarriage that\u2019s a stillbirth. Which may explain why your husband is so emotional. I do agree suggesting therapy may be a good idea, he seems overly distraught over a baby that wasn\u2019t his.", "NTA. \n\nHis reaction to you reaching out to him was oddly defensive. That part in particular, I do not find \u2018normal\u2019. Not to rot your brain with what may be a ludicrous idea, is it possible that your husband is much closer to either his friend Bill, or Bill\u2019s wife, than you may know? \n\nFor what it is worth, I would feel exactly the way you do. You are not an asshole for having feelings.", "NTA. Maybe he wasn't the father, but could your husband be in a relationship with them? I know that sounds really out there. I just can't imagine why he is taking it so hard. I understand his friend and the wife are still grieving, but your husband grieving like this seems so off.", "[removed]", "NTA, based upon the info as presented. I consider my personal level of empathy to be low-normal and your husband\u2019s reaction does seem over the top to me. My advice is to consider the relationship of the two friends and also your husband\u2019s level of empathy/emotions, in general. How does current day compare to pre-tragedy?", "NAH. Your husband should see a therapist. He is clearly going through the grieving process, and you are not qualified to help him through that.", "NAH. I lost my baby in March few days before she was supposed to be born. That was 9 months ago and I have friends who still cry over my loss, my baby, and me  - because they wanted to meet her and looking forward to being part of her life. They are so sad and we didn't even get to meet when I was pregnant since I was in a different country. So I can only imagine how your husband feels as he saw the experience firsthand.\n\nYour husband needs to see a grief therapist though for him to understand how and why he is this affected. Did their loss make him scared that things like this happen and made him worried/anxious about your future family? Or did he already want a child that made him excited for his friend's baby?\n\nBtw, around the 6-month mark is already a stillbirth and not a miscarriage.", "NTA- if he is this raw he may actually be harmful to his friends.   People grieve in their own way, and time- but having someone constantly bring it up to them has to be harder.", "I think NTA. You have a right to be concerned. I would be if my husband was this distraught over a miscarriage that wasn\u2019t ours. I understand being supportive of his friend and helping him process but there\u2019s no need for to snap at you when you asked why he was crying. He could use so grief counseling or maybe just regular therapy to work out why he feels so strongly about this.", "Nta for me. He needs therapy this isnt normal imo. Maybe if it was his kid or grandkid but it wasnt SIDS or anything the baby wasnt born yet. The fact he isnt even getting a little better in months is weird", "INFO: \n1. you say that you \"caught him crying\"; can you say a little more? Was he trying to conceal that he was crying? The reason I ask is because he might not have had an opportunity yet to express his grief in a way that was met with the support he needed in order to process it. This could be part of why it's taking so long; he might be attempting to repress it, only resulting drawing it out longer. \n\n2. You say you asked him what about. How would you describe your body language and availability in that moment? What was on your mind? \n\nMy intuition is saying NAH. Perhaps a sensitive guy and deeply connected friends. Perhaps an emotional investment and grief that is taking your husband as much by surprise as you. Perhaps a concerned partner (you) who is out of their depth and grasping for support.", "NTA.

Sooner or later, this is going to devolve into a conflict about how you don't care enough or can't see where he's coming from (if it hasn't already) and *that* will become the new source of tension instead of the more reasonable you feeling alienated in this marriage due to his ongoing grief for his friend's stillbirth.\n\nI very much get the sense you *do* care about what Bill and his wife have experienced, but that you're also able to filter that empathy via an appropriate level of perspective.

She would\u2019ve went though all the pain to hold the child she\u2019s loved for the best part of this year, with her entire being, and that would never even take a first breath.

He could\u2019ve been crying about stubbing his toe right then for all you know, or a dead raccoon on the side of the road. \n\nBut I do think you need to look at this from a different angle. They likely had a name or names period picked out. They probably decided on a crib, it might even have been bought by then. The registry was probably finished a while ago, and if mom or dad were taking paternity leave that\u2019s been long settled. A baby shower was probably in the works or already planned. Your husbands probably been called uncle *and* called himself uncle already *a lot*. Everyone involved with the baby and mom and da directly has already fundamentally shifted in what they considered a permanent way for months now. But what they\u2019ve been waiting for for close to half a year is hollow and gone. \n\nEvery wanted baby that a parent loses is hard, but to lose your child so far in, when you have to go through labor knowing there\u2019s no happy ending, there is just something different about it. The baby was *real* to not just the parents but also your husband. And it\u2019s actually kind of normal for him to still cry about it three months later. If my best friend lost a child like that, I think I would be crying off and on for a few months too. Edit: I actually have a few pregnant friends (baby boom I SWEAR TO YOU), one whom is my absolute best friend, and they just hit seven months. I\u2019m crying right now thinking about the possibility of my niece dying. I\u2019m prepared to love her like she\u2019s my own flesh and blood for the rest of my days. I would be devastated. \n\nI also think therapy would be beneficial to your husband after all this; still borns are hard, even on the family. He needs therapy in general for this rough shit and his rough handling of it, but I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s unnatural either. This was a death for mom and dad and those closest to them, and your husband by all accounts was closest.\n\nEdit to add again: I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s that weird that OP\u2019s husband is still crying over this stillbirth. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s too meshed with his best friend because he loved the baby. That\u2019s his best friend, probably feels more like his brother after all this time. My best friend is the closest thing I have to a sister. I\u2019m already Aunt RiByrne. That means that every time we talk, we talk about her pregnancy and the baby. It\u2019s not *all* we talk about, and I still have plenty of time to tell her about my stuff, but because her life is preparing for a baby, it means I\u2019m putting in slightly more time with her. It means I send Amazon gifts to her house twice just because I wanted to, because I love her and her expanding family and I\u2019m still gonna buy separate stuff to give both her and her husband for the actual shower. This will be my nibling. I go sometimes to the bulk store she likes with her because her husband works crazy hours and she can\u2019t lift stuff anymore. I get it into her car from the store, and he would get it out. Besides her husbands mom and her grandma, I\u2019m usually one of the first to know any updates or see the ultra sounds. Just like all the crazy stuff in her life I\u2019ve slightly held her hand for and stood by her, given extra help and love during, Im doing so during an impending child. This isn\u2019t her being entitled to my time or money, nor me being too involved, this is just how *families* work when they love each other and want to genuinely support each other. I don\u2019t just love my best friend, I love my best friends baby. She\u2019s a living piece of one of my favorite people in the world. Because I know I love my best friend the same way I love my actual brother, I know I will love her baby the same way I\u2019d love his child, one that would share my actual blood. I love her because she\u2019s my niece. I love her as an actual person, already. She\u2019s not here yet, but she\u2019s already my family. \n\nI feel like a broken record, and I\u2019m probably way too close but I don\u2019t think there are any assholes here because I don\u2019t know that you\u2019re seeing the full picture here, OP, and I don\u2019t think that makes you an AH, or your husband one either. I think that just means there\u2019s a disconnect.\n\nThis was a stillbirth. When people grieve death of a family member, especially a baby this is what happens. I\u2019m my best friends family in the way Op makes it seem like her husband is Bill\u2019s. And if her baby died just a month ago and she had to deliver it like normal, I wouldn\u2019t be okay. A brother could have done all that and cried three months later about it and I don\u2019t see how people would find that weird of an excited and then devastated uncle to do. Chosen family is still family.\n\nEdit ONCE AGAIN: Comments have pointed out that based on this timeline, the original due date of the baby is literally coming up.

You have to go through the *whole birthing experience* to produce a tiny little corpse. No joyful cry at the end of it, no lovely snuggles. \nThey've been friends for nearly half your husband's life, that kid was probably going to be your god child. \n\nYou don't \"get over\" the death of a child, you just learn to live with it and let the wound become a scab, then a scar. Eventually you'll wake up and the first thought will not be about the child you lost. Eventually you'll have a full day where you don't think about the child you lost. That doesn't happen over night. It doesn't happen over three months, or years. The timeline is different for everyone. Your husband is being a supportive friend for his best friend as well as mourning the loss of his godchild - where have you been in all this? I see no mention of how you have been supporting him during this time?", "In my experience, the level of grief people go through with regards to miscarriage is directly related to the level of expectation that person had around the meaning of the introduction of this new potential child into their lives. Your husband is grieving for two things in this instance: the loss of an idealised potential future that he has clearly envisioned and is struggling to let go of, as well as the loss of his good friend's happiness and relationship stability. Quite often it is the abject *helplessness* we experience when our loved ones go through grief which also entangles us in *their* grief. \n\nI think what you've done here is isolate yourself from the grief process unintentionally, which is causing your husband to become more enmeshed in his friends grief because he doesn't have a safe space to articulate those emotions with you and lean on *you* for support, so he's moved beyond empathy into sympathy (meaning he's got drawn into the grief cycle with his friend). This inhibits his ability to be a good support for his friend because the really important thing as the support person is to be *stable* something he can't do in this circumstance. \n\nIdeally, you'd be supporting his friend and his wife *as a couple*. Take food, listen, talk, invite them out somewhere for a break from cycling in misery. No one has to \"get over it\" in a particular timeframe, but the idea is that they develop better and better strategies to assist them with dealing with loss. Your husband isn't actually much good to his friend if what he is doing is just cycling through the intense part of the grief process with him. Also, a couple who have lost a pregnancy need to lean on *each other* in this and your husband might fundamentally need to back off so this couple can do that. He might be an easier person for his friend to talk to, but that vulnerability is something his friend should be trusting his wife with. \n\nUltimately, I think NAH, but something sounds a bit unhealthy. For the sake of *both* your marriages, I think you should be learning to support each other. You haven't said anything about your relationship with his wife, but perhaps she could use a cup of tea and a chat? I think it would be better if supporting his friends was more of a team effort between you.", "NTA. Something is going on that is not \"normal.\" He should see a therapist.", "NTA\n\nNope. This is in no way a normal reaction for a friend. There's something else going on, and it isn't good. Your husband is not being honest with you. Good luck.", "NTA.\nYour husband and Bill\u2019s relationship is too enmeshed and it is threatening Bill\u2019s marriage, and yours.

That could explain the fresh upset - doesn't explain why husband was so committed to his friends pregnancy in the first place", "Maybe it's his baby.", "At first I was like yta.  But no you're NTA.  I am betting that your spouse was a donor and didn't tell you.", "NTA, you seem well-intentioned. A lot can get lost in translation when grief is at the forefront of someone's mind and emotions. Perhaps it would be useful to write him a card, explaining how you understand that this has been a hugely emotional time for him and you're simply not sure if you are being or how to be of support to him, clarifying that's why you suggested therapy so he has a space of support and you're happy to go with him if helpful so you can better understand what this all means to him and how his processing works.\n\nTherapy isn't necessarily just for those with a diagnosed mental health condition, etc. It's there as a support place to process emotion and life changes for those directly going them, or those supporting those who are, because that can be I credibly draining in and of itself.\n\nGood luck OP", "IDT either of you are the AH.  Every person on the planet handles grief differently. Certain things affect certain people differently. It may seem odd to you that he is taking this so hard, but like someone said above. Giving birth to a corpse can absolutely WRECK a person/family. It is awful. I couldn\u2019t imagine the pain, and emptiness. So I\u2019m sure your husbands friend is really going through it\u2026 and seeing someone you care for deeply in so much pain makes you feel pain. So I would bet his friend is a wreck a lot of the time. Or at least when he talks to your husband. But it is good to have someone to talk to. He may not have anyone else other than his wife. Also, there is not a time limit on how long/short that pain will last. So my advice would be try and talk to your husband about it a little more. Like really listen. Is his friends sadness 100% from the loss of their baby, or is some of it from the marriage being on the rocks?  A mix of both?   Don\u2019t assume anything\u2026 just show you want to be there for him even though it didn\u2019t happen to either of you.  And I wouldn\u2019t rule out therapy.

Maybe he was promised a role of 'uncle' and felt connected to the baby that way. Maybe he is undergoing some mental health struggles and this event has been a catalyst of sorts. You cant internet sleuth your way to an answer.\n\nI absolutely agree his reaction isn't normal and therapy would be beneficial - but it sounds like he might not be easily convinced of this fact.

You didn't mention if you have kids, so maybe its a proxy thing he wanted, and now its gone, he's hurting and his friend is grieving. At 24 weeks, thats a big shock and it's not really a miscarriage, it's a death in their family and by extension his.\n\nIts also possible it has triggered some kind of emotional event form his childhood that he has never discussed.  Men are odd that way, myself, i've always been pretty controlled and not had much contact with death and grief, i had a sister who was stillborn before i was born, i don't even know about her until i was 13, and my family don't really bring it up, but there was a re-internment of babies in the cemetry where she is buried there was no markers for the graves there inititally, that i'd never visited and i had passed a bit for work, one day, i just decided to go in and have a look, and it jsut hit me like a ton of bricks, that i had a sister there that i'd never really acknowledged, and it really effected me for weeks afterwards,  When we had our first baby, i had a similar reaction and i was a bit of an emotional mess for a few weeks, and i actually went and talked to somebody about it.\n\nI think what your husband really needs, is a hug and to be able to let it out with you, maybe see someone, it might seem silly or off to you, but you are not in his head, and he needs to be understood on this and it acknowledged as being a shit situation.", "Sounds like they are probably nearing the due date from the timeline as well.", ">if so, he maybe should have discussed it with his wife\n\nMaybe???", "No you don't understand!

Plus, his friend may have some guilt over a pending divorce while losing a child. \n\nI suggest being supportive and give him time.

She finally pushes the baby out. And instead of hearing the baby crying at birth like you expect, it's just...silence.

And then they have to hold its limp body and say goodbye to the baby they had a lifetime of dreams for. That is an awful, awful thing for anyone to go through. I would never wish it on anyone.\n \nI think it is completely understandable that your husband probably already loved this child, since it was his close friend's child, and is grieving just like he would if the baby had died at birth.

Will SO say \"We can't do that because Bud lost his baby- how can you be so heartless?\" This could potentially have dire consequences to your relationship. How long does he plan on being in mourning? At some point, the feeling of pain and loss have to be put away. Some people instead choose to wallow in those emotions, instead of processing them and moving on with their life. This overindulgence in grief definitely has a shelf life, and it's about past its expiration date. If he refuses therapy to learn how to process this, learn coping mechanisms, and chooses to wear it like an albatross around his neck, you may need to introduce some fresh frief into his existence....", "NTA Stand your ground on this because there is more to this emotionally and/or physically.  It's dangerous to the marriage.

I'm not saying there has to be more that has happened between Bill and the husband but it seems very odd that a twenty year old would be instant best friends with a sixteen year old for strictly platonic reasons. \u201dHe's a really good friend\" makes sense for mourning that friend's lost baby, but not quite for being just as destroyed as the friend four months later, nor why the almost-college-grad decided he liked the sixteen year old boy as a best friend the day they met. Just seems like there is a reason for this very close relationship that OP herself is unaware of. I wish her luck.", "Thank you. It's crazy to me that so few people here have friends who feel as close as siblings.\n\nEveryone running to \"they must have secretly been lovers\", or \"maybe the baby was your husband's\" make me sad, because that's just a form of shaming guys with close emotional relationships.\n\nNo one would be saying this is evidence of a secret affair if it was a woman grieving her friend's lost child.\n\nToxic masculinity through and through.", "OP tells those suggesting it's husband's baby that \"100% can't be his due to medical reasons\" which suggest infertility. OP also says they're planning on having a baby, but no idea on when. Suggests to me that husband wants a baby enough to have done testing and either they're planning on medical intervention or adoption; sounds like husband wants a baby *now* and OP has an idea they'll have a baby *eventually*.\n\nAnd that's fine in itself (though I think OP and husband need to talk timing out *now*) except could be a reason he's taking it hard. \n\nJust thought of this - if best friend's marriage is disintegrating over this, even when OP and husband have a baby, it's going to be bittersweet for a man who is essentially his brother, if they divorce. The mourning could be for the lost baby, best friends marriage, and the idea that both couples would have children who grow up together - man might have had this whole idea of an idyllic family life and it's looking harder to create as time goes by. \n\nOf course, this is all guesswork.", "While I agree on your sentiment of how painful it is to lose a baby, at the end of the day, OP is just concerned about her husband's wellbeing after the fact. I don't see why expressing her concern for her husband should be met with such hostility. People grieve and cope in their own way.", "OP later implies her husband is infertile and the baby 100% can't be his, but they're talking about having a baby themselves. OP hasn't expanded on this. \n\nMy take? Husband wants a baby *now* and OP wants a baby *eventually* (which is fine that each have their own desires and she's not obligated to pop one out for him, but this should be discussed). Best friend and wife get pregnant *now* and OP's husband \"practically furnished the nursery and baby supplies\" - suggesting he was way more involved with the idea of baby than the best friend. Then the couple lose the baby at six months, three months ago - baby's due date would be *this month*, right around Christmas. The couple might even have had a stocking for baby. Had plans to ring in the new year with baby. Holidays are an emotional time already, and grief refreshes around the due date of a birth that ended in tragedy.\n\nIf husband if infertile, it could even be the fact that the longer they wait, the less likely medical intervention will work. OP hasn't commented on *how*, so if it's medical rather than adoption, perhaps husband is watching the biological clock for a baby tick away. If it's adoption, maybe it's that they don't have a goal post mile marker set in stone for the process, and he's beginning to doubt it will happen at all. \n\nOP seems to not understand *why* he's grieving three months out. She seems to think he's taking it hard, and thought so merely weeks after the loss, which wasn't a miscarriage but a stillbirth (which is physically taxing and extra traumatic - another commenter said they went through a stillborth around this time and they wrap the baby in blankets to let you hold it, a second commenter said she gave borth at this time and baby survived as a premature baby - so this baby was fully expected to live by the people surrounding it until it was no longer alive). \n\nSo has OP been asking him to go to therapy over totally understandable grief that may be based on a lot of factors here? Or has OP been saying the equivalent of \"Sad about that baby again? Why do you care so much?\" Because if someone approached me like that about my own grief/trauma (and death of anyone close to you is traumatic - death of a stranger can be traumatic, tbh, bringing home to the fact that you will die/even if his wife gets pregnant OP and his baby can die/perhaps he had death trauma in the past this stirred up) I would be defensive and angry too. \n\nI commented this elsewhere but perhaps OP should acknowledge this baby and/or life meant so much to him that it's *normal* to be affected by grief over something like this, especially if he considered this a chance to play uncle and with husband's apparent inabilty to have biological children without medical intervention in mind. And to help the completely normal response to whatever this represented for him (his chance to be a uncle to a newborn, perhaps practice for his own someday child OP and he would have, the idea that life is fragile and fleeting, the possible frustration at their own childless status) he should go to counseling for it, because that in itself is not in question. \n\n(Or maybe the theories about Bill and husband running away with baby to be gay dads is right and he needs therapy for way more than just this grief/infertility issue - idk, I feel like OP should put this medical inability in the post because that and the mention that they *plan* on having kids changes the context of the situation for me)\n\nEdited: misspelled words", "> Your husband is overdoing it. It's not even his baby.\n\nExactly. So many comments aren't even mentioning this. They're just like \"grief is normal and people go through it differently.\" Not to mention they completely ignore the fact it's not even his kid...\n\nTo me that just means your husband has unhealthy levels of attachment to both the friend, that potential baby, and their lives (for whatever reason). For his own well being he may need to step back.", "If he was the sperm donor, then how he made the \"deposit\" is also very important.", "My great-grandmother had a still birth of a full term baby.

I don't think that is a hurt that would ever go away.  Not to mention, 3 months ago, the wife was 6 months pregnant.  Right about how would be her due date, and I'm sure when they were pregnant they were looking forward to their first Christmas with their child, instead they are mourning.

And Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and who tf knows what else! Holidays can be hard all around for various reasons and now it's even harder because they won't have baby's first Christmas, baby's first stocking, baby's first snow.

Bill's wife had to go through the trauma of actually pushing a CORPSE out of her body and you're upset your husband has sympathy for his best friend and his wife? Where is YOUR sympathy? Your entire post absolutely drips of contempt and jealousy for your husband's feelings and his relationship with his best friend, from the way you seem to resent how much he helped with the nursery, to how you \"Caught\" him crying. It's a very telling word to a linguist, because that indicates that it is a shameful act that he hiding from you. Gee i wonder why he wouldn't cry in front of you. It IS your husband's loss too, contrary to what you seen to think. Or if your brother or sister died, is it not allowed for you to grieve too because it's your parents loss? If you lost a baby, are you saying you're so strong that you can just get up and forget about it and wouldn't care if your best friends were standoffish and cold because it wasn't their baby? In your comments you've essentially said your husband is basically infertile. He could be viewing this as his chance to be there for a kid through his best friend. Not just that, he could be terrified of the future because, as you said, you do have child options, so he's probably horrified that if an otherwise fertile couple could lose their child randomly, how much worse is it going to be for you two who will struggle to conceive at all and STILL have the possibility of losing your child? All you asshats that immediately jumped to DL and emotional affairs and sperm donor, I ASPIRE to have such an easy life that I can not see any other way it could have been. I'm truly jealous that you've had such trauma-free lives that any deviation from what you consider the norm is automatically something sketchy. You wanna know why I'm so incensed? Because this situation happened to me. I had a truly awful and abusive childhood. I left home when I was 16 and have been on my own ever since. Meeting my best friend was a blessing. He was all I had, my only support, my only family, he was essentially my world and the most important person in my life until I met my wife. We call each other brothers and his kid was going to be my nephew and godson. For someone with no family, that was MONUMENTAL for me. His wife is a lovely woman who always makes sure I have a place in their home and family Because she knows how much it means to me. I went waaaaaaaay overboard on buying things during the pregnancy, reading up on all sorts of contingencies if situations arose, even started a college fund for an unborn child! That's how invested I was. And when the baby was lost, I was DEVASTATED. No sperm donation, no latent homosexual feelings, just LOVE FOR MY FRIENDS AND SADNESS ABOUT MY NEPHEW. All of my hours away from them were spent sobbing and throwing up, while every second of my free time was spent with them supporting them in their grief. Because humans need support! He grieved with his wife because they BOTH lost their child , and I supported them and grieved on my own so as not to burden them. Even now, years later, I still include the baby that was never born in my daily rosary intentions. I donate so a Mass can be said once a month for the repose of his soul. My friends and I have a dinner of rememberance every month for him. Your husband is supporting his friend. I guarantee he's not going over there and they're clutching each other wailing like dramatic cartoons. Bill most likely feels he can't show emotion while supporting his wife, and is privately crying to his best friend who is being strong for him, and then crying at home. Newsflash: empathy takes a lot out of you, and being someone's support is even harder. It's why almost all therapists are in therapy. It's why all AA sponsors have a sponsor. It's why priests go to confession. Sadly, you're a cold-hearted bitch and are shaming him for not being able to be a stone during this traumatic period. THIS REACTION IS EXACTLY WHY BILL IS GRIEVING IN PRIVATE. And your judgement of their marriage is despicable too; even a cursory search will show you that the loss of a child at literally any stage in life from conception to old age causes a HUGE impact on a marriage. Some can't get past it and divorce. Others find other paths. Just because things are tense with them doesn't mean it's your husband's fault for being sad, or that somehow Bill is a monster and trying to sabotage his own marriage. A good friend would be trying to HELP them come together and fix their marriage, not judge them for being sad and pick on her husband for crying. And if the marriage really is on the outs, that's even more of a reason that your husband wants to comfort his best friend since Bill will now have twice as much to mourn for. Gawd you are an awful woman. But even so, I still sincerely hope you never have to reach the level of grief of even your husband, let alone Bill and his wife. Because it can break you.

My sister was only a little further along and it was one of the most traumatic things to go through and for me it was from a far since I lived across the country.

Usually you guys are all over 'gatekeeping grief' which is what OP is doing.\n\nIt's actually quite sad that because a man has the audacity to show compassion for a close grieving friend, he must be 'romantically involved' - do you hear yourselves? This is not an 'art studio' situation and you know as well as I do that if it was the wife acting this way about one of her girlfriends' miscarriage, you would be eviscerating anyone implying she's 'too emotional'.\n\nThe toxic sexism towards men having the audacity to be emotional in a healthy way does speak volumes.", ">your husband is acting like he actually lost a baby\n\nDidn't he in a way though? *\"He would visit at often as he could and it seemed like he was singlehandedly funding the baby's wardrobe and nursery, honestly.\"* \n\nIf he and Bill are as close as they are, it would make total sense for OP's husband to be referred to as \"Uncle So and So\" and he would be thinking of their child as a niece or nephew. \n\nI would 100% bet that they've discussed outings and experiences that he was excited to be involved in, like \"I'll take him fishing!\" or \"Your Dad and I will build you for first treehouse!\" or something.\n\nSo no, he didn't lose **his** child but it sounds like he's reacting to the death of a family member and I agree he needs therapy to cope, but this doesn't sound that weird to me.", "I don't think the husband is being an asshole either though, he is in a state of severe emotional distress and lashed out a bit.

When I had my miscarriage, close friends cried and mourned with me at every milestone for the whole year.  That's part of having a healthy support system, which many men lack - which is why I think people are too harsh on the husband and suspect a secret affair or something.  The idea that a man can have deep feelings for close friends is baffling to them.  It's absurd.  NAH", "I really think this is a NAH. I have a friend that lost their 7 month old fetus a few months ago. I sit with them on a regular basis and provide support and care. 6 months means that the woman had to go through labor to pass the fetus -- that probably looked viable -- or had a defect that they probably got to see. They had milk come in, they had their body change, their hormones change, their body prepare for a child that didn't happen. They had to take down their nursery. Seeing that is devastating. I'm still not over it for my friends, I get teary after comforting them. \n\nIt's not about the baby (totally), it's about seeing your friends' anguish and loss. There are days I get calls or texts from them so in their grief. I can't count the 1am calls that were just us both crying together while we talked about anything to help the night pass or sleep to come. Grief is complicated, and OP's husband has watched this devastate his very close friends. He's not crying about the baby, he's crying over watching his friends fall apart and try to re-assemble. It's so painful to watch and the best you can do is just be there. And, If you don't see it, you just shrug, or can't understand it. OP isn't at fault for being confused (she's not in it), and OP's husband isn't at fault -- he's handling his own emotions about it, and the friends aren't at fault -- they just lost their child. \n\nI do think therapy could help OP's husband, since it might be nice to have a space to talk about his own sadness and his role of comforting his friends as they struggle with this loss. He needs spaces to self-soothe, find new activities that help his mood and promote self-care, he needs places to focus his grief on. Being a friend to people in waves of grief is **so hard.** It can burn you out to be in grief so long.\n\nOP, I'm sorry that this is happening, and I hope that you can sit down and listen to your spouse, and that he can feel comfortable in telling you what is happening for him also. His friends might tell you that they will never be the same. I've watched that very much happen. I miss those people, but have these different but similar ones, and I still love the new people very much. It's still sad, and I also see the others in their life just flee for the hills. There's no shame in any choice, but I see such courage in OP's husband for staying there and caring for the people he's known for half his life a they change into new-ish people.", "Agree, NAH.
