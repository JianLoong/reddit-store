He would visit at often as he could and it seemed like he was singlehandedly funding the baby's wardrobe and nursery, honestly. \n\nUnfortunately, they suffered a miscarriage just before the six month mark. Bill and his wife were understandably devastated, and so was my husband. I got it - he was watching his best friend go through something unimaginably painful. He was often gone for long periods to time comforting Bill because not only had he suffered this loss, his marriage didn't seem to be holding up very well either. \n\nThe miscarriage occurred at the end of September. Now, this is where I might be a huge asshole, so I'm in desperate need of judgement-- I completely empathize with Bill and his wife still needing time to recover, but my husband is ALSO still acting as if this is fresh. Not just in the way he's still comforting his friend during his free time or excusing himself to take hours long phone calls, but the intensity of his emotions. I caught him crying about a week ago and when I asked him what about, he got angry with me and said it should be obvious. \n\nI was surprised to be met with such malice over a simple question, so I tried to gently suggest that maybe therapy would be beneficial. He was feeling this loss like it was his own, and I didn't find that very healthy. In fact, I had been concerned about him since mid-October if I was honest but had no idea how to broach the subject.

Being empathetic is one thing but this does seem a bit over the top. Either there\u2019s more to this story (and I hope there isn\u2019t) or he does need to speak to a therapist to work out why he is so enmeshed with his friend. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nI think suggesting your husband see a counselor is a good idea. Doesn\u2019t mean his feelings are wrong, but a counselor could help him process what happened.", "NTA. This is very unusual, and your suggestion of therapy is right on. I\u2019d be incredibly surprised if my husband displayed the behavior you describe.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is unusually enmeshed here. Like weirdly so. I don't think his relationship with Bill is entirely platonic.  \n\nHave you seen Bill and his wife recently? If you've been distancing yourself I'd say it's time to go when your husband does so you can judge just how things are between the three of them. Whatever it is that's bothering your husband, it's clear he's grieving much more than a friend's lost baby.", "NTA, are you sure this wasn\u2019t an affair baby your husband fathered?", "NTA. Therapy asap. \n\nYou sure this wasn\u2019t husbands baby? Secret donor? Affair? That does not seem normal.", "NTA, you checked in on him with a simple question and it seemed to have triggered him causing a blow out. While I empathize and respect a sensitive person, it is a bit strange to still be harboring such strong emotions over someone else\u2019s miscarriage. At the end of the day, life goes on, and while it will take longer for bill and his wife to heal from this, I do think it might be time for hubby to talk to a professional about his strong feelings towards this. Best of luck to you OP", "NTA. And you're right, this isn't healthy. It's very odd that bugs so grief stricken over his friend's wife's miscarriage. Even if the friend is close enough to be his brother, it still isn't healthy. It's not normal. Husband seems to be taking it personally, as if he's lost his own child.", "NTA. Doesn't sound like you coldly told him to get over it or something. Everyone deals with emotions differently, but that seems a bit extreme. I don't think you'd be expected that long after to just automatically know why he was crying.", "NTA, your husband's emotions and actions are highly unusual. I don't like asking this but is it possible there's more to the relationship between your husband and Bill than you realise? It all sounds rather a bit odd, taking it far too personally it seems.", "NTA because you were not being a jerk and telling him to get over himself because it wasn't his kid. You expressed a concern for his well being for internalizing his friend's pain so deeply. You offered support in doing so and he took it very badly. I'm not sure what would be helpful honestly.", "NTA. It's a tough one to call but it seems unusual he is taking this so hard. You were right to suggest therapy as maybe there's sth else at play maybe he's not even realising. \nWay more than enough time has passed for this to play out emotionally. Especially for your husband, I'd say.", "NTA. It sounds to me like your husband is over-identifying; as though the miscarriage was his and Bill's.", "NTA and your husband's behavior is a bit weird. He can be upset but crying seems like he was somehow involved in their life somehow or he is 5 years old.", " Plot twist: the nursery was meant to double as a studio in which art could occur. \n\nNTA", "Idk this one is hard. For me NTA. It doesn't sound like you were rude about anything and you tried to communicate with him so for him to get so defensive this really is a difficult one. I think there's also this stigma against therapy when it really could be beneficial. There could be something underlying on top of the miscarriage that is bothering him that he needs to talk through. It's important to note that you are 2 different people that handle your emotions differently so you should not feel bad that you are not as affected by this as he is.", "I'm curious.... Do you and your husband have children? Does he want children?", "NAH - While I get people have different levels of sensitivity, I'd be pretty positive this is not a healthy reaction after this much time when your not the one who has suffered the loss directly, and you'd know better than anyone whether your husband should be reacting THIS severely to the loss. Sounds like you approached it as well as you could and your husband needs to talk to someone", "NTA, but at six months that\u2019s not a miscarriage that\u2019s a stillbirth. Which may explain why your husband is so emotional. I do agree suggesting therapy may be a good idea, he seems overly distraught over a baby that wasn\u2019t his.", "NTA. \n\nHis reaction to you reaching out to him was oddly defensive. That part in particular, I do not find \u2018normal\u2019. Not to rot your brain with what may be a ludicrous idea, is it possible that your husband is much closer to either his friend Bill, or Bill\u2019s wife, than you may know? \n\nFor what it is worth, I would feel exactly the way you do. You are not an asshole for having feelings.", "NTA. Maybe he wasn't the father, but could your husband be in a relationship with them? I know that sounds really out there. I just can't imagine why he is taking it so hard. I understand his friend and the wife are still grieving, but your husband grieving like this seems so off.", "Hey OP, you are the spare (not even third) wheel in this weird tango. Hubby and Bill are a couple, bill\u2019s wife is a surrogate in all but name and you are being taken for a ride here. Open your eyes and ears and smell the bullshit. NTA", "NTA, based upon the info as presented. I consider my personal level of empathy to be low-normal and your husband\u2019s reaction does seem over the top to me. My advice is to consider the relationship of the two friends and also your husband\u2019s level of empathy/emotions, in general. How does current day compare to pre-tragedy?", "NAH. Your husband should see a therapist. He is clearly going through the grieving process, and you are not qualified to help him through that.", "NAH. I lost my baby in March few days before she was supposed to be born. That was 9 months ago and I have friends who still cry over my loss, my baby, and me  - because they wanted to meet her and looking forward to being part of her life. They are so sad and we didn't even get to meet when I was pregnant since I was in a different country. So I can only imagine how your husband feels as he saw the experience firsthand.\n\nYour husband needs to see a grief therapist though for him to understand how and why he is this affected. Did their loss make him scared that things like this happen and made him worried/anxious about your future family? Or did he already want a child that made him excited for his friend's baby?\n\nBtw, around the 6-month mark is already a stillbirth and not a miscarriage.", "NTA- if he is this raw he may actually be harmful to his friends.   People grieve in their own way, and time- but having someone constantly bring it up to them has to be harder.", "I think NTA. You have a right to be concerned. I would be if my husband was this distraught over a miscarriage that wasn\u2019t ours. I understand being supportive of his friend and helping him process but there\u2019s no need for to snap at you when you asked why he was crying. He could use so grief counseling or maybe just regular therapy to work out why he feels so strongly about this.", "Nta for me. He needs therapy this isnt normal imo. Maybe if it was his kid or grandkid but it wasnt SIDS or anything the baby wasnt born yet. The fact he isnt even getting a little better in months is weird", "INFO: \n1. you say that you \"caught him crying\"; can you say a little more? Was he trying to conceal that he was crying? The reason I ask is because he might not have had an opportunity yet to express his grief in a way that was met with the support he needed in order to process it. This could be part of why it's taking so long; he might be attempting to repress it, only resulting drawing it out longer. \n\n2. You say you asked him what about. How would you describe your body language and availability in that moment? What was on your mind? \n\nMy intuition is saying NAH. Perhaps a sensitive guy and deeply connected friends. Perhaps an emotional investment and grief that is taking your husband as much by surprise as you. Perhaps a concerned partner (you) who is out of their depth and grasping for support.", "NTA.

He could\u2019ve been crying about stubbing his toe right then for all you know, or a dead raccoon on the side of the road. \n\nBut I do think you need to look at this from a different angle. They likely had a name or names period picked out. They probably decided on a crib, it might even have been bought by then. The registry was probably finished a while ago, and if mom or dad were taking paternity leave that\u2019s been long settled. A baby shower was probably in the works or already planned. Your husbands probably been called uncle *and* called himself uncle already *a lot*. Everyone involved with the baby and mom and da directly has already fundamentally shifted in what they considered a permanent way for months now. But what they\u2019ve been waiting for for close to half a year is hollow and gone. \n\nEvery wanted baby that a parent loses is hard, but to lose your child so far in, when you have to go through labor knowing there\u2019s no happy ending, there is just something different about it. The baby was *real* to not just the parents but also your husband. And it\u2019s actually kind of normal for him to still cry about it three months later. If my best friend lost a child like that, I think I would be crying off and on for a few months too. Edit: I actually have a few pregnant friends (baby boom I SWEAR TO YOU), one whom is my absolute best friend, and they just hit seven months. I\u2019m crying right now thinking about the possibility of my niece dying. I\u2019m prepared to love her like she\u2019s my own flesh and blood for the rest of my days. I would be devastated. \n\nI also think therapy would be beneficial to your husband after all this; still borns are hard, even on the family. He needs therapy in general for this rough shit and his rough handling of it, but I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s unnatural either. This was a death for mom and dad and those closest to them, and your husband by all accounts was closest.", "I'd say NTA, you're worried about him, and he needs help to get through these emotions, and talking to someone could help. Also, the conclusions people are jumping to in this thread wow.", "Husband banging the husband anyone? Or husband and wife?", "NAH. I don't know if there is something more going on, and I'm not going to speculate, however I do know what it's like to lose a baby. \n\nFor better or worse, it sounds like your husband was very attached to this baby. Your husband has likely spent months thinking about all the things he would do with the baby. Plans and dreams for the future. And now the baby is gone. A thousand dreams crushed in a moment. It's incredibly hard to let go. That grief never really disappears.", "Yes, youre not just an asshole, but a fucking monster. Thats a human life right there, what the fuck is wrong with you? \n\nMaybe you dont need r/AITA but r/Therapylessons", "NTA\u2026 I agree that\u2019s very excessive and I\u2019m doing to go as far as saying that it\u2019s very weird, If I was in your shoes I would start investing things because something isn\u2019t clicking.", "Was he going to be the god parent? I've seen similar reactions from god parents with losses like this. I highly suggest therapy.", "I agree with many of the other commenters, it seems like they Bill and your husband are more than friends, possibly it\u2019s a poly relationship between the three of them.. but usually all people would be consenting in poly relationships and I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not which makes me a bit unsure.. but his reaction is definitely way over the top and makes it seem like something is definitely going beyond friendship there.", "I'm going to say slight ESH, your husband for acting as if it his own child that has been lost. You for saying it's a miscarriage, as that downplays the severity of their losd. At that gestation it would be considered a stillborn. However it could just be that you did not know that. I would edit your wording on your post.", "YTA\n\nMisscarriage and 6 month mark are a whole different cookie.\n\nAt 6 months it's a tiny baby that died.\n\nIf your husband was closely involved in the pregnithat leans he saw pictures a plenty, imagined a whole life as an 'uncle', possibly godfather.\n\nAnd you're annoyed that he's grieving a lost future?", "NAH.\n\nPerhaps his malice comes from not having an outlet for these feelings. You're trying but you don't really understand why he's feeling like this, and you're a convenient person to lash out at. \n\nHe's in dire need of a grief counsellor of some sort. Grief can affect people in very different ways and it sounds like he was overly involved in this baby. He probably had fantasies of being the fun, amazing uncle who would take the child out to do this, that, and the other. That crashing down on him obviously hit hard.", "NTA but there's a chance your husband is just overtly sensitive to pregnancy situation, is he someone who gets baby fever or talks about wanting kids? After all this would have been his honorary niece or nephew since Bill seems to be his best friend", "NTA. You're right, this is odd. \n\nSomething else is happening with your husband about this - have no idea what - and your suggestion of therapy was a good one.", "INFO: is there any possibility that your husband thought the baby was his?  Do you and your husband plan on having children?\n\nAlso- NTA\u2014 but something else is going on here.  It\u2019s almost as if he is grieving his own child/potential to be a father.", "I think that what needs to be remembered here is that this was not a miscarriage.   At 24 weeks, unintentionally losing a baby is a stillbirth.   It\u2019s physically traumatic to go through because you have to actually *give birth* to a corpse.   A formed baby that has all its parts.\n\nIf my best friend went through that, I\u2019d grieve with them for longer than a week.   Studies have shown that it\u2019s psychologically no different to have a stillborn at 24 weeks than it is to have one at 30 or 40 weeks, or to lose a baby to SIDS.  You\u2019d think it would be harder the longer you \u201chad\u201d the baby, but apparently not.\n\nMy family has lived through stillbirths, and also infant deaths shortly after birth.   I can tell you from experience that it feels the same - that you just say \u201cwe lost a baby\u201d because it ceases to matter if the baby cried outside the womb or not.\n\nI did not carry or birth any of these children.   They were my siblings, cousins, and aunts.   I know what it\u2019s like to be a spectator to the parents\u2019 grief.  \n\nFor that reason, I think NAH.", ">he does need to speak to a therapist to work out why he is so enmeshed with his friend. \n\nIt's his best friend? The baby would have been his honorary niece or nephew, I don't get why people are acting like it's potentially this big dramatic cheating situation. When it could also be that he's sad for his best friend. I remember I cried for hours once when my sister in law lost her baby, I remember it because it was three years after and it just suddenly hit me.", "Came here to find this comment", "Someone give this comment a gold.", "What is this from this sounds super familiar", "That\u2019s not even close to what she said to him, though.", "You need therapy. Do you cry ofer EVERY life lost?", "Oh.", "Actually, I was thinking perhaps this is triggering his past grief. Has he experienced a miscarriage before or death of a loved one he could have bottled up?", "Not to be rude but are you 100% sure there\u2019s not something going on with his friend or his friend\u2019s wife or both? Is he usually this emotional over others or is this new? Because it seems deeply personal for him.", "How ?", "Otherwise eh.", "Girl, do you not see this is Brokeback Mountain in real life? Your husband probably thought he and Bill would raise the baby, so he\u2019s grieving like he lost his own child.", "I don\u2019t get what this comment means can you explain?", "I'm sorry OP but I think you're not seeing something.  Your husband is upset because he was involved some how or is upset he cannot have kids. This is going to lead to resentment.", "From what you've shared, do you think your husband and Bill are more than friends?\n\nBecause you literally described an affair.  From what you know it's emotional. I'm wondering who he's actually speaking to on the phone. Is it Bill or his wife?\n\nIs it possible there's someone else and he's using this for cover to sneak away/talk to another person? \n\nIs he incapable of having children? Would this be his only chance to feel near a closely \"related\" kid?  \n\nThis is way deeper than what you know. It's one thing to be sad but he's mourning this like it was his own child. Has he ever had anyone near him die?\n\nHis behavior is that of someone who lost hope. What was the hope for? Its a tragedy, don't get me wrong. I feel really bad for their loss, but there's something else going on for him to be this deeply affected. Is he facing his own mortality? Has he lived a charmed life this far and never had strife? Is he approaching a mid-life crisis? \n\nI think he needs therapy and you need to dig deeper. I would be highly suspicious if my husband started to behave in this manner. Is your husband normally very emotional?\n\nYou're NTA", "I have never heard the word autoincorrect before and it\u2019s perfect.", "Or, you know, OP\u2019s husband has come face to face with his own mortality after this miscarriage and is having an existential crisis", "If he\u2019s infertile he was probably looking at this as being the next best thing since he can\u2019t  have  a child himself. So he grew really attached and that\u2019s why he\u2019s taking it so hard. He had planned his role out to be an attentive uncle. Could also be that\u2019s it\u2019s bringing up his infertility and he\u2019s depressed about that. Therapy is a good idea.", "youre a clown", "own that fraud"]}
