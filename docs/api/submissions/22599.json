But for the sake of my love, i welcomed them in. They chatted a bit in the kitchen while i was getting everyone's drink. That was until 7F realized Minecraft was on the PS5 (my girlfriend was playing) and started to scream at the top of her lungs she wanted to play, controller was in girlfriends hands, so sister saw that and asked if she could let her niece play for a bit, girlfriend looked at me and i said no, sister replied saying she asked girlfriend not me, to which girlfriend replied saying that she was in my house and it was my console so i answered regardless of who she asked. \n\nShe started going off about how it's she can't afford to buy games for her daughter and how hard is being a single mom, basically screaming at gf and me at which point i told her \"it's not my fault you decided to open your legs to a deadbeat, now get your kid and leave\" which was received as well as you'd imagine, girlfriend had to almost physically shove them out of my place and has since started getting texts from her whole family demanding she breaks up with me and saying it's appalling \"the way she let me treat her older sister\", girlfriend doesn't think i'm the asshole but said i could've been more diplomatic.

If you want to degrade women for having sex and sexualize them in this way, women would be wise to decline to sleep with you more generally. You were well within reason not to share your games or console, but I suspect that you were spoiling for a fight from the minute you saw them at the door, based on your own immediate comments and assumptions. The sister shouldn\u2019t have argued about it and should\u2019ve dropped the subject, but everything after that is on you.", "Where to start. First off, you had every right to refuse the child access to your stuff. But your comment to the sister. You were wrong. Do you have proof that the woman knew the guy was going to be a deadbeat?

It\u2019s incredibly gross that you said that in front of a kid, too.  \n\nIf I was your GF I\u2019d break up with you on grounds of being gross and misogynistic and leave you alone to play with your collectibles.

The mother has been left with a child and no financial support. She is trying to stretch her limited resources (time and money) for two people. A family typically shares that responsibility, and she is doing it alone. Many people commend single parents. Instead of recognizing that, you insulted her for the act of having a child and not having the resources to pay for luxurious toys.\n\nYour girlfriend's family wants her to dump you because you insulted her character. They likely feel that your beliefs would also apply to your girlfriend.", "It doesn't matter if her sister yelled at you, that was a cruel, disgusting thing to say to a woman.

Although it's clear that the daughter was a surprise guest, it's hard to justify being a dick to a 7 year-old. A 7 year-old wanting to play Minecraft is the most natural thing ever. Obviously, SIL overreacted and escalated, but the things you said to her weren't kind either. Frankly, OP, you seem like you enjoy telling people off.", "She isn't your SIL. Yeah, YTA.

But you absolutely should have ACTED YOUR AGE and provided a mature, firm response without INSULTING your guests.  You need to grow up.  You sound about as mature as the 7 year old - different being HER  reaction was somewhat age appropriate (ish).", "YTA it\u2019s outrageous that you think it\u2019s ok to talk like this in front of a child. Especially about their mother and father.  I hope your GF dumps you and finds someone with more tact, consideration, and patience.", "Stuck between ESH and NTA. SIL doesn't have any obligation or right to demand anything in YOUR house. That being said, you could've handled it better and avoided insulting her. \n\nAlso, I get that you really care about your PS5 because I do too but if I were in your shoes I'd have let the child play for a while, supervising her. It's just me. But yeah you could've been more diplomatic about it as your girlfriend said.", "NTA, because the sister has a pushy, noisy daughter that she apparently drags with her anywhere she goes and got intensely rude about the PS (\"I asked her, not you,\" as though OP were interfering in his own house) and started screaming at OP.\n\nSo why should he be diplomatic? He wanted it over NOW, and the best way was to rip into her, raising the stakes terminally.\n\nEveryone is getting up on him because of the language he used, but no one is appalled by the sister invading his space with her BS. Now she knows she isn't going to be able to bulldoze her way through life with her monster child screeching Gimmee gimmee.\n\nThere is a tendency for children nowadays to (sometimes, depending on the parents) rage through the cosmos as entitled brats, raising hella noise about everything and throwing tantrums as if they were rice grains at a wedding. I don't blame anyo9ne for seeing red when another one shows up. If this sister can't raise a decent kid, she shouldn't be toting hjer around--espe cially not without giving advance warning.. \n\nDownvote me all you like, who cares?", "YTA. Saying no is absolutely fine. Misogynistic comments? Totally unacceptable and unnecessary. And in front of a child...gross.", "ESH (but GF). You could have avoided the entire confrontation by being nice to the child.", "LOL I mean you definitely could have handled a lot better but NTA good for you telling her off like that", "You really wouldn\u2019t share your toys with a 7 year old girl?", "ESH. \n\nThe sister and her kid sound unpleasant but did your parents not teach you to share?", "Did you handle it perfectly? No, obviously not. BUT, sister is the AH for not reining in the kid and letting her scream in your apartment. Sister was being entitled and you don\u2019t have to bow to that. NTA", "Protip:\n\nAllowing the kid to play your precious PS5 for a few minutes probably wouldn't have killed you, and would have kept the kid occupied (and less likely to mess with your other stuff out of boredom).\n\nSecond protip:\n\nBeing an asshole to a little kid (and make no mistake, you were an asshole to this poor kid) is never going to win you points with the girlfriend's family. You're in the doghouse with them forever and deservedly so.\n\nIf you really didn't want the kid playing with your game, there are about a million ways you could have handled this without being such a prick to kid and mom.\n\nYTA.", "It was an AH way of handling it, the things you said and all, but NTA because it's kind of normal to not want kids near the stuff you own, especially if you don't know the kid.\n\nIt would've been nice to just let the girl play a little, but I get being touchy about things you really like. The mom handled it poorly by being over dramatic.", "Esh.  I do have a feeling the girlfriend is a bit tired of dealing with her older entitled sister though.  The way the sister speaks and says that she was asking girlfriend and not you seems like she\u2019s got a bit of a chip on her shoulder and maybe is use to parents pressuring girlfriend into submission.  Then when girlfriend says \u201cshe was in my house and it was my console so I answered regardless of who she asked\u201d indicates a lot for me.  The girlfriend seems to be trying to be reasonable and direct that it\u2019s not her place or stuff so sister should accept the answer. Then for the sister to go off on you both screaming shows absolute entitlement in my opinion.  And the parents demanding girlfriend break up because their golden daughter got told off???  Yeah I feel bad for your girlfriend in that whole family dynamic. (Scape goat comes to mind).  When girlfriend says she doesn\u2019t think you are an ass indicates just how much of the entitled bull crap she has been dealing with from her family over the years. \nThat being said you went too far with your words.  You could have been less crude.", "NTA. You met rudeness with rudeness. Not diplomatic, but fair.", "ESH for the shouting match. But like, I can't help but point out that letting the kid play mine-craft is probably the safest thing for them to do, isn't it?", "NTA\n\nCould you have handled it better? Of course. But you're not a diplomat so that's not your prerogative. She was told an answer, and reacted exactly the same way the kid did (which probably explains where she got it from).", "NTA kids a brat, but story seems a tad bit fake.", "ESH. It may have been implied that the kid was gonna be there since the sister is a single mom but they had to inform you definitely.\nThe kid was a kid, but the sister had absolutely no right to behave the way she did and to insult you or your GF and to lord her mothergood over your heads just to get what she (or in this case her kid) wants.\nBe that as it may you are a grown ass man and there was a child in the room. You are a complete AH for your choice of words. It doesnt matter who the father was - that is not your business. It doesnt matter how loud the child was - its a child, the game it not more important than a human. It doesnt matter how rude the lady was - you should NOT have insulted her and her kid. That just shows you are a low quality human. So hearing you say that i too would advise your gf to break up with you just because it shows your character is not good. So do better.\nP. S. I wrote it in simple English so I hope you understand.", "ESH.   Your reaction was entirely out of line and out of proportion to the situation.   The sister at least as presented here is an entitled mom who thinks everyone should cater to their kids whims.   Your GF is fine, she didn't do anything wrong.", "Yta - that escalated quickly .\n\nYour comment was gross and inappropriate, specially infront  of a little girl.\n\nYou should have told your gf to meet her sister elsewhere if you were so dam uncomfortable with people invading your space. \n\nBut I\u2019m assuming isolating your gf from family is your plan with your outdated sexist views .\n\nGross", "YTA. That is your \u201clove\u2019s\u201d sister and you slut shamed her. I wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to speak to my siblings that way.", "You\u2019re not only an asshole, you\u2019re a fucking asshole.

She needs to kick you to the curb.", "YTA- the family is right if that's how you talk to people you aren't boyfriend material.\n\nIf you didn't want the kid playing Minecraft that's fine, but there's no reason to insult people in the process", "NTA.. entitled brats", "SIL is rude and ignorant. She was in your home with your belongings and had the nerve to say she was asking you? That's a lot of audacity. Personally, I think your SIL got what she deserved. She was rude from the beginning and it escalated. She was trying to use being a single mom as a way to get what her child wanted. My goodness you just met her and she is acting very entitled. You didn't get her pregnant so this isn't your responsibility.", "ES here", "NTA but for the love of god if a kid comes over just let them play on the console.", "NTA, but you and/or your girlfriend should have asked who was going to be coming over. If anyone asked, you would have known in advance that a child was coming over. Also, you don't have to let children, especially children you are not expecting, play with anything in your home if you don't want them to.

Accidents happen. SA happens. People we think are solid men turn out to be AHs like you.", "YTA", "ESH\n\nRegardless of the fact that she was out of turn for insisting that her daughter use your stuff you also have the ability to control what comes out of your mouth.\nWhat you said to her was completely out of pocket. You were absolutely disrespectful.\n\nThere is a difference between saying,\" this is my house and I've already given my answer. If it does not satisfy you then you can go ahead and meet elsewhere.\" and insulting your girlfriend's sister like that on the same day that you met her.\n\n\nYou both owe each other an apology. \n\nYour girlfriend would be totally justified in breaking up with you for it because it shows a complete disrespect of her sister, an inability to manage your reaction, and a lack of understanding of how to speak around children. \n\nWhy say all of that when \"These are my things, I said no.\" should suffice.....", "ESH\n\nYou hit way below the belt. You blew up and you should apologize. This is not a good start to the relationship. SIL was a jerk, you upped the jerk level x 100. \n\nKudos, you both are ridiculous children. Meanwhile, your girlfriend is in the trenches taking grenades.", "op must be insecure of many things in his life if he reached such a low point so quickly but mannnn\n\nwth yta", "ESH \n\n\nI would expect a single 7 year old to be able to manage a home with breakables, and to understand asking > demanding.  This reaction (if accurate) on kid and moms part suggests some serious parenting lacks and if it\u2019s WHY you wouldn\u2019t share that\u2019s reasonable.  But frankly you seem to have some preconceived ideas about kids that makes me question if the kid even DID \u201cscream\u201d a demand, or just was excited.  You\u2019d still have right to say no but certainly not a kindness.\n\nI\u2019m also unsure why you didn\u2019t think kid would naturally also be there, unless normal for them to stay with grands or something.  I\u2019d still have asked.\n\nSingle parenting is hard but no excuse to act way mom did. She is a complete AH for that.  But immediately going to sexist AF comments and saying what you did in front of a child?  Yea that\u2019s big red flag OP.  Sis being in the wrong doesn\u2019t absolve you from being an AH too.", "Honestly, ESH. Seems like you both reacted poorly in this situation, and honestly, sister just seems unhinged. She (1) had a child that screams over a video game, (2) tried to override you through your GF at your house, (3) tried to use her financial situation to manipulate/guilt you into letting her daughter use your things, and (4) failed to act like a mature adult and tell you how disrespectful that was to say, let alone in front of a 7yo, and then picking up and leaving (and maybe even asking if GF wanted to go with her to grab coffee/go for a drive) once she realized how unwelcome she was. Having to practically shove an adult out of your house when she doesn\u2019t know you is wild. \n\nHowever, your comment is insanely disrespectful and uncalled for. You could have absolutely just said something mature and firm like \u201cI don\u2019t really know you so I cannot confirm or deny what you are telling me. I really like GF and want to see more of her so I would like to also get to know you better and have a healthy relationship with boundaries. With that, comes respecting my answers to what can and cannot be touched within my house. If this is not something you can agree to, then maybe it is better that in the future we meet somewhere more kid friendly so we can all have fun and not worry\u201d\n\nYou really should apologize to sister and her daughter. Maybe take them to somewhere with a kids play area or arcade and get to know them with GF. It could be a great way to save this relationship if you see a future. Sister sounds like she will be a problem no matter what but you did go way out of line. Then you can be in family\u2019s good graces and in the future any craziness by sister can be met with preparation and handled skillfully so you have no worries about being TA", "You sound 14, not 24.", "YTA and this has to be fake. No one would say that to someone they just met especially when they mentioned wanting to make \"their love\" happy.", "YTA. She was rude but you were appalling to say that as a grown adult. Also why are you calling her \u2018SIL\u2019 when you aren\u2019t married and only have been with your gf 4 months? Thats a joke", "This is hilarious, nta", "Cool fact.  You can be right and also be an asshole.", "YTA. I know guys like you. They tell a story like this when hanging with the homies but omit and bend so many facts. You know it.", "YTA for writing this fake scenario because you thought you would get upvotes", "What a way to implode the relationship with the family fast.", "Shouldn't it be ESH?", ">but you really went over the top with your \u201ckeep your legs closed\u201d comments\n\nSeriously. CASE closed!", ">\u201ckeep your legs closed\u201d comments to the sister.\n\nI don't think that's what he said... he said \"keep your legs closed for deadbeat losers\"* which frankly sounds like pretty solid advice", "The sister was also rude to op. ESH TO everyone but the gf and niece.", "Ok I legitimately do not know why this is a downvote lol this is accurate I\u2019m putting it back at zero", "I don't think OP cares.", "No. OP tipped the scales in his favor.", "lol it would have been way more believable if you just said you were going to change the gender to make it less recognizable.", "That comment was uncalled for. YTA big time\u2026", "Yeah the kid probably just yelled omg Minecraft which really isint that big of a deal", "Well that\u2019s a red flag", "It's a console. What's the worst thing that could happen, a broken controller? Even that isn't at all likely.", "Quite frankly in a non-childproof house filled with collectibles the video game system was probably the safest thing for her to do. Next time try addressing the mom with \"it's a $70 controller for a $600 system she can only play if you are willing to take full financial responsibility if she breaks it.\" It would be even better if you tactfully or even not so tactfully just say \"hey I didn't know you were bringing your child this isn't really a good place for kids to be there are a lot of expensive breakables why don't we change plans up\" \n\nBoth of these options are still a little AHish but forgivable and understandable. Instead you verbally attacked your girlfriend's sister who was invited into your house. You just destroyed your relationship.", "But his sister was still an asshole to his girlfriend who did nothing wrong.", "Yeah I wasn't sure which one to go with. Mom was definitely not in the right but OP was completely out of turn. \n\nHe had a Reddit level reaction like he'd been waiting his whole life for a seven year old to touch one of his things.lol", "It's a bad faith comment. You won't.get more than that.", "Yes, but OP went highly personal and mean. There are ways to get your point across without resorting to low attacks.", "I know. It wasn't his finest moment.", "True but that doesn't make his sister 100 percent a victim. She still harassed the girlfriend and OP's actions doesn't absolve her of that.", "Not only did he go mean, but did it to in effect a complete stranger. \nI do think it falls under ESH though as the sister started complaining (loudly if OP is to be believed)about being a single parent when that's not at all his fault and he simply didn't want a 7 yr old breaking his controller and/or console", "All that is true. Ask them to leave. But to go nuclear to humiliate the sister? That's what tipped the scales. Sister needs to get her kid under control and herself. When I was a kid, I would have asked my mother first if I could ask my aunt to play and if told no, end of discussion.", "There's a massive difference between 'not my problem' and an incredibly sexist, shaming comment. Even with the sister being so rude, if I was your gf I would be worried that this was your immediate response to a mild conflict.", "His asshole behavior doesn't change that she was being an asshole. In fact, she was an asshole first, so you can't say that her behavior was in response to his behavior. Being told no is not an excuse to justify that kind of entitled tirade in someone else's home. There's no scale of morality that says her behavior is now acceptable and doesn't deserve asshole credit because of what he said. I won't go so far as to say his response was justified, because he did hit below the belt and that puts him into asshole territory as well, but this is definitely an ESH situation.", "Yes, but a strictly YTA judgement lets her off the hook entirely. I Didn't say he wasn't an AH or even the worse of the two but in this case so is she. \n\nIf it was the sister posting would you then judge her NTA  because he is worse or would it be ESH?", "You didn't know what 'opening your legs for a deadbeat' meant? These are very specific, colloquial phrases, there is no way that this was something lost in translation.", "Quit blaming the language. I\u2019m going to be completely honest. You\u2019re sexist. Bad English or not.", "And also very unlikely to be true"]}
