But for the sake of my love, i welcomed them in. They chatted a bit in the kitchen while i was getting everyone's drink. That was until 7F realized Minecraft was on the PS5 (my girlfriend was playing) and started to scream at the top of her lungs she wanted to play, controller was in girlfriends hands, so sister saw that and asked if she could let her niece play for a bit, girlfriend looked at me and i said no, sister replied saying she asked girlfriend not me, to which girlfriend replied saying that she was in my house and it was my console so i answered regardless of who she asked. \n\nShe started going off about how it's she can't afford to buy games for her daughter and how hard is being a single mom, basically screaming at gf and me at which point i told her \"it's not my fault you decided to open your legs to a deadbeat, now get your kid and leave\" which was received as well as you'd imagine, girlfriend had to almost physically shove them out of my place and has since started getting texts from her whole family demanding she breaks up with me and saying it's appalling \"the way she let me treat her older sister\", girlfriend doesn't think i'm the asshole but said i could've been more diplomatic.

If you want to degrade women for having sex and sexualize them in this way, women would be wise to decline to sleep with you more generally. You were well within reason not to share your games or console, but I suspect that you were spoiling for a fight from the minute you saw them at the door, based on your own immediate comments and assumptions. The sister shouldn\u2019t have argued about it and should\u2019ve dropped the subject, but everything after that is on you.", "Where to start. First off, you had every right to refuse the child access to your stuff. But your comment to the sister. You were wrong. Do you have proof that the woman knew the guy was going to be a deadbeat?

It\u2019s incredibly gross that you said that in front of a kid, too.  \n\nIf I was your GF I\u2019d break up with you on grounds of being gross and misogynistic and leave you alone to play with your collectibles.

The mother has been left with a child and no financial support. She is trying to stretch her limited resources (time and money) for two people. A family typically shares that responsibility, and she is doing it alone. Many people commend single parents. Instead of recognizing that, you insulted her for the act of having a child and not having the resources to pay for luxurious toys.\n\nYour girlfriend's family wants her to dump you because you insulted her character. They likely feel that your beliefs would also apply to your girlfriend.", "It doesn't matter if her sister yelled at you, that was a cruel, disgusting thing to say to a woman.

Although it's clear that the daughter was a surprise guest, it's hard to justify being a dick to a 7 year-old. A 7 year-old wanting to play Minecraft is the most natural thing ever. Obviously, SIL overreacted and escalated, but the things you said to her weren't kind either. Frankly, OP, you seem like you enjoy telling people off.", "She isn't your SIL. Yeah, YTA.

But you absolutely should have ACTED YOUR AGE and provided a mature, firm response without INSULTING your guests.  You need to grow up.  You sound about as mature as the 7 year old - different being HER  reaction was somewhat age appropriate (ish).", "YTA it\u2019s outrageous that you think it\u2019s ok to talk like this in front of a child. Especially about their mother and father.  I hope your GF dumps you and finds someone with more tact, consideration, and patience.", "Stuck between ESH and NTA. SIL doesn't have any obligation or right to demand anything in YOUR house. That being said, you could've handled it better and avoided insulting her. \n\nAlso, I get that you really care about your PS5 because I do too but if I were in your shoes I'd have let the child play for a while, supervising her. It's just me. But yeah you could've been more diplomatic about it as your girlfriend said.", "NTA, because the sister has a pushy, noisy daughter that she apparently drags with her anywhere she goes and got intensely rude about the PS (\"I asked her, not you,\" as though OP were interfering in his own house) and started screaming at OP.\n\nSo why should he be diplomatic? He wanted it over NOW, and the best way was to rip into her, raising the stakes terminally.\n\nEveryone is getting up on him because of the language he used, but no one is appalled by the sister invading his space with her BS. Now she knows she isn't going to be able to bulldoze her way through life with her monster child screeching Gimmee gimmee.\n\nThere is a tendency for children nowadays to (sometimes, depending on the parents) rage through the cosmos as entitled brats, raising hella noise about everything and throwing tantrums as if they were rice grains at a wedding. I don't blame anyo9ne for seeing red when another one shows up. If this sister can't raise a decent kid, she shouldn't be toting hjer around--espe cially not without giving advance warning.. \n\nDownvote me all you like, who cares?", "YTA. Saying no is absolutely fine. Misogynistic comments? Totally unacceptable and unnecessary. And in front of a child...gross.", "ESH (but GF). You could have avoided the entire confrontation by being nice to the child.", "LOL I mean you definitely could have handled a lot better but NTA good for you telling her off like that", "You really wouldn\u2019t share your toys with a 7 year old girl?", "ESH. \n\nThe sister and her kid sound unpleasant but did your parents not teach you to share?", "Did you handle it perfectly? No, obviously not. BUT, sister is the AH for not reining in the kid and letting her scream in your apartment. Sister was being entitled and you don\u2019t have to bow to that. NTA", "Protip:\n\nAllowing the kid to play your precious PS5 for a few minutes probably wouldn't have killed you, and would have kept the kid occupied (and less likely to mess with your other stuff out of boredom).\n\nSecond protip:\n\nBeing an asshole to a little kid (and make no mistake, you were an asshole to this poor kid) is never going to win you points with the girlfriend's family. You're in the doghouse with them forever and deservedly so.\n\nIf you really didn't want the kid playing with your game, there are about a million ways you could have handled this without being such a prick to kid and mom.\n\nYTA.", "It was an AH way of handling it, the things you said and all, but NTA because it's kind of normal to not want kids near the stuff you own, especially if you don't know the kid.\n\nIt would've been nice to just let the girl play a little, but I get being touchy about things you really like. The mom handled it poorly by being over dramatic.", "Esh.  I do have a feeling the girlfriend is a bit tired of dealing with her older entitled sister though.  The way the sister speaks and says that she was asking girlfriend and not you seems like she\u2019s got a bit of a chip on her shoulder and maybe is use to parents pressuring girlfriend into submission.  Then when girlfriend says \u201cshe was in my house and it was my console so I answered regardless of who she asked\u201d indicates a lot for me.  The girlfriend seems to be trying to be reasonable and direct that it\u2019s not her place or stuff so sister should accept the answer. Then for the sister to go off on you both screaming shows absolute entitlement in my opinion.  And the parents demanding girlfriend break up because their golden daughter got told off???  Yeah I feel bad for your girlfriend in that whole family dynamic. (Scape goat comes to mind).  When girlfriend says she doesn\u2019t think you are an ass indicates just how much of the entitled bull crap she has been dealing with from her family over the years. \nThat being said you went too far with your words.  You could have been less crude.", "NTA. You met rudeness with rudeness. Not diplomatic, but fair.", "ESH for the shouting match. But like, I can't help but point out that letting the kid play mine-craft is probably the safest thing for them to do, isn't it?", "NTA\n\nCould you have handled it better? Of course. But you're not a diplomat so that's not your prerogative. She was told an answer, and reacted exactly the same way the kid did (which probably explains where she got it from).", "NTA kids a brat, but story seems a tad bit fake.", "ESH. It may have been implied that the kid was gonna be there since the sister is a single mom but they had to inform you definitely.\nThe kid was a kid, but the sister had absolutely no right to behave the way she did and to insult you or your GF and to lord her mothergood over your heads just to get what she (or in this case her kid) wants.\nBe that as it may you are a grown ass man and there was a child in the room. You are a complete AH for your choice of words. It doesnt matter who the father was - that is not your business. It doesnt matter how loud the child was - its a child, the game it not more important than a human. It doesnt matter how rude the lady was - you should NOT have insulted her and her kid. That just shows you are a low quality human. So hearing you say that i too would advise your gf to break up with you just because it shows your character is not good. So do better.\nP. S. I wrote it in simple English so I hope you understand.", "ESH.   Your reaction was entirely out of line and out of proportion to the situation.   The sister at least as presented here is an entitled mom who thinks everyone should cater to their kids whims.   Your GF is fine, she didn't do anything wrong.", "Yta - that escalated quickly .\n\nYour comment was gross and inappropriate, specially infront  of a little girl.\n\nYou should have told your gf to meet her sister elsewhere if you were so dam uncomfortable with people invading your space. \n\nBut I\u2019m assuming isolating your gf from family is your plan with your outdated sexist views .\n\nGross", "YTA. That is your \u201clove\u2019s\u201d sister and you slut shamed her. I wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to speak to my siblings that way.", "You\u2019re not only an asshole, you\u2019re a fucking asshole.

She needs to kick you to the curb.", "YTA- the family is right if that's how you talk to people you aren't boyfriend material.\n\nIf you didn't want the kid playing Minecraft that's fine, but there's no reason to insult people in the process", "NTA.. entitled brats", "SIL is rude and ignorant. She was in your home with your belongings and had the nerve to say she was asking you? That's a lot of audacity. Personally, I think your SIL got what she deserved. She was rude from the beginning and it escalated. She was trying to use being a single mom as a way to get what her child wanted. My goodness you just met her and she is acting very entitled. You didn't get her pregnant so this isn't your responsibility.", "ES here", "NTA but for the love of god if a kid comes over just let them play on the console.", "NTA, but you and/or your girlfriend should have asked who was going to be coming over. If anyone asked, you would have known in advance that a child was coming over. Also, you don't have to let children, especially children you are not expecting, play with anything in your home if you don't want them to.

You were good until you said the thing about opening her legs. That\u2019s a big, big, big AH thing to say.", "Bruh. YTA.\n\nYes, SIL should have respected your space and belongings but wtf are you thinking talking to ANYONE like that?\n\nAnd further, you\u2019re welcome to keep your toys away from actual children but that, too, makes you and AH whether you like it or not. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d", "I mean that\u2019s some misogynistic bullshit Op. you could have handled that in a way that didn\u2019t blow up your potential future family. If I were your gf I\u2019d be giving you you as a person the side eye for some of those comments and the way you managed yourself.", "I just *love* that we live in a world where women get blamed for men being deadbeats, and somehow the same people say sexism isn't real/significant.\n\nYTA", "NTA. \n\n\nAll you said was the truth.", "Hi guys, English is also not my first language\u2026 \nBut would \u201cthe trash took it self out \u201c apply in this case?\nYTA", "YTA. While you have the right to say no you went about in the completely wrong way and now there\u2019s probably irreparable damage with your GF\u2019s family.", "What the actual f...you didn't have to let the daughter play with your stuff at ALL, no problems there, but the misogyny?!?! WTF?! And your girlfriend took YOUR side there?! JFC. You deserve each other. YTA.", "ESH, but you are the bigger AH. \n\nYou had every right to refuse the request to play the game. And the Sister should have let it go after that. Which is why she is an A.\n\nBut you were completedly out of line with your comment especially as you sad it in front of the kid. Have some goddam decency and keep those toughts between adults. Or better yet keep it to yourself. \n\nAlso was it really worth it? Now her entire family hates you.", "NTA! It\u2019s not ur fault she can\u2019t afford to buy stuff for her daughter.", "I\u2019m just confused as to why you are calling your girlfriend\u2019s sister your sister in law.", "Yeah you most definitely are the asshole. Like wow", "You may be correct in principle, but so completely and absolutely are YTA.", "bro is tweaking YTA all the way bro jesus christ", "Pretty sure you ruined any semblance of acceptance in your gfs family.  Plus you probably aren\u2019t going to get a blessing from her family if you decide to get married.  Ouch for you and your gf.", "Yta that response was way too far", "Wow, your gf is a really shitty sister. But I'm sure she \"opens her legs\" well enough, so you don't mind that.\n\nNow that we have that sarcasm out of the way. What you said is disgusting, and your attitude from the moment you opened the door is disgusting as well. Your gf *is* a shitty sister and person in general if she doesn't break up with you.\n\nYou could have simply explained that you didn't want to risk the child breaking your controller and left it at that. But you let your misogynistic, disrespectful mouth spew out filth. You should be ashamed of yourself. And your gf should be as well.\n\nNot to mention, why would she play Minecraft in front of the child?? Of course, the kid is gonna want to play! Your gf might be dull witted, but I'm sure she \"opens her legs\" well enough, so you're fine with stupidity. Ugh, typing that out sarcastically makes me feel sick, and yet you actually said it seriously. Wow.\n\nYTA.", "Yup. If I was OP I wouldn\u2019t want the kid in my apartment either, but the way we spoke to the sister was so disrespectful.", "It\u2019s always surprising how quickly people start screaming while OPs remain calm in these stories", "No. It was justified. Inviting your kid to someone else's house then throwing a tantrum when someone who's not even your family tells them no? Yeah, what OP said was mean but not unjustified.", "My 7 yr old nephew throws his controllers when he gets mad at a game. Because of his behavior is why I told him repeatedly that he can not play on our laptop until he can prove to me consistently that he won't throw a controller when he gets mad. Guess who still hasn't touched my laptop.", "I mean, when you're a single parent to a 7 year old, you kind of have \"drag\" them with you wherever you go. Can't exactly leave them home alone at that age.", "It's his house lol. If anyone's getting kicked out it would be the girlfriend.", "without even mentioning breaking it, kids are notorious for having sticky, booger picking, germ infested hands, i wouldn\u2019t want the kid touching my gaming system either.", "she is 7 and its a ps5 controller, its hard to break one for a grown adult.", "If anything it would distract the kid from zeroing in on other, more fragile things.", "You don\u2019t do that well for yourself financially if you\u2019re that fucking stressed over a PlayStation controller", "\u2026have the kid wash their hands?", "Thank you. I was thinking, yeah give the kid the controller, she won't move, we can talk and she will have a good time. \n\nOf course, he didn't care enough to decide if it was a boy or girl type child sooooooo", "Don't use big words if you don't know what they mean. Nothing he said was misogynistic, he merely stated a fact. I hate when people feel entitled to other people's things because they made bad choices in life. I don't go around asking rich people for things because i can't afford them, it's idiotic but she gets a pass because....single mother due to her own choices? NTA", "Honestly, every time I read one of these stories where someone is supposedly \"screaming\" at the OP, I side-eye. Maybe I've been fortunate but I cannot say I've come across all that many people who scream when up until then, the interaction has been calm and reasonable. \n\nEveryone sucks here  if the OP's rendition of the story is accurate. I suspect it's not though, so it's a YTA for me.", "It isn't OP's sister, it's his girlfriend's sister.", "I can see that, but you should also be backing up saves to the cloud or a thumbdrive. It's easy as hell on a Playstation.", "The older sister's behaviour was rude, selfish, and demanding. She deserved to be criticised for that and asked to leave. However, it was misogynistic of him to be cruel and judgemental about her status as a single parent. He doesn't know what happened during her relationship with the child's father or what led him to be a deadbeat. He blamed the single mother who is supporting her child rather than the absent father who isn't. That's misogynistic slut shaming. A seven year old witnessed OP speaking like that to his/her mother.", "Thanks broseph", "It\u2019s not a fact though. You don\u2019t know someone\u2019s a deadbeat until they\u2019re a parent, which by the time of conception of the sister\u2019s first child he likely wasn\u2019t. She may have not made the choice to be a mother, let alone a single mother, and certainly shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for the other parent\u2019s absence.\n\nOP was entitled to deny the kid the game, and once sis blew up at him certainly didn\u2019t have to tolerate her or the kid in his flat. People didn\u2019t say she should get a pass for being horrible, but that it doesn\u2019t justify his slut shaming.", "It can't be E S H, cuz the gf did nothing wrong, and the 7 year old while annoying in this case, is a 7 year old.\n\nSo OP is YTA and the SIL is also an AH.", "It was the girlfriends sister", "Doesn't sound like that7 year old has been taught the manners  that should have been used at the time.  The screaming would have had me asking for them to leave.", "Your gf\u2019s not the one you need to apologise to. It\u2019s your SIL."]}
