She went into labor unexpectedly on our narcissistic mother\u2019s 40th birthday during her party. K\u2019s boyfriend was deployed so he wasn\u2019t able to attend. K\u2019s water broke mid way through the party but when K tried to tell our mother and new husband they said K was just trying to take away her day. Everyone else at the party just brushed her off. I, having witnessed it all offered to take K to the hospital. We got to the hospital about 30 minutes after her water had broke. Within the hour my beautiful niece was born. She was even named after me. K posted a picture of me holding A as her baby announcement. Text came flooding in asking when our family could meet the baby. K was having none of it she told everyone included our mom and step dad that they were not to see the baby because no one wanted to help her. Soon after they had spoke to K my phone was blowing up with texts and calls from our mother telling me to talk to K to change her mind about seeing A. She said it was her birthday and they she didn\u2019t think was actually in labor. I told her no that everyone needed to respect K\u2019s decision. She along with a bunch of other family members are calling me the a$$hole for not trying to change my sisters mind right after giving birth. I feel like I might be the A hole because everyone was drinking and preoccupied at the party and my sister had just gave birth and was pretty emotional that she could\u2019ve been just been making a decision without thinking.

You're a good sister.", "NTA -Your family brushed your sister off to keep partying. Your mother, in my mind, was the worse. \n\nDo not discuss this with your sister. Her baby, her rules.

I was a few years older than her when my first was born, my husband was holding my hand, and I was still terrified.

OF course she doesn't want to see them, and that's her right.  Make sure she gets support, including mental health evals.

The fact is your mom, stepdad and others messed up big time. And instead of accepting accountability for that they are trying to place the blame on you or your sister for having the audacity to actually go into labor on her mothers birthday.", "No. This is a boundary set by the mother.

It\u2019s not about being there for your sister, helping her while she struggles through these first days of motherhood alone. \n\nJust tell them what they want to hear, you tried but she said no. Then help your sis and respect her choices. Sometimes when we become moms, our ability to really gage relationships becomes clearer, because we now have a really good reason to set up boundaries.\nBut telling her she\u2019s wrong so early on could cloud her reality and second guess her instinct, especially since she trusts you. Respect her like the rest of the family didn\u2019t.", "NTA.  It is not your responsibility to manage the relationship between your family and A.

Without their flying monkeys, the narcissists can't do half so much damage. \n\nI bet if your mom has been behaving in a narcissistic fashion all your life, you can think of some times when she's used flying monkeys against you, too. And you probably didn't like it one bit. \n\nDon't be a flying monkey. No matter how much she pressures you to pressure your sister.

It's only two more years until you're officially an adult.  (I realize that this feels like forever at 16, but I swear it's temporary and you'll get there.)  Please start thinking about and  planning for college or for vocational training that will allow you to support yourself and will get you out of there just as soon as possible.  \n\nYour future doesn't have to look like this.", "Ok, can we really stop with just assuming every post is fake?

I was considering moving in with my sister but I wanted to give her time to bond with her baby and move in when she feels comfortable. I have plenty crazy mom stories that I plan to share in the future. Thank you so much for your support.", "If her bf is deployed, you might offer to move in now and give her a hand with the baby. Having a newborn is TOUGH, especially alone. If you could handle a lot of the cooking, cleaning, etc...even just playing with baby while she takes a shower, those things are *golden* to a new mom.", "I completely agree with this.  If you're more comfortable out of your mom's house, and if your sister agrees that this would be a good thing, it would be more of a help than an imposition!  So hard to have a new baby when you're on your own!!!  Also, what about a summer job?  Saving for college or just to have savings to help you move on when you're old enough could be really good for you.  Maybe you could open the account in your name and your sister's name, so you'd have privacy and access.", "NTA\n\nWater breaking can make labor super painful and going from that to giving birth in a couple hours is really really intense, likely without pain relief, and very scary. \n\nFamily didn\u2019t care about your sister and her baby earlier; pressuring her means they still don\u2019t care now.", "NTA. You could always phrase it as everyone was drinking and therefore unsafe around a newborn plus not taking her water breaking and therefore health seriously makes her question if your family is safe around your niece.", "NTA", "NTA.  Her water broke AT THE PARTY.  How on earth is that not a believable indication that someone is in labor?  Your mom is a huge AH, and you need to just respect K's wishes right now.  I wouldn't want someone like that around my baby either.", "NTA... your sister needs time to decide if and when and who will meet her child. Now she should just focus on her health and her baby", "NTA, these are all adults and they can make their own decisions and accept their own consequences.\n\nIt's not your job to fix this disaster.", "Daaammmnnn girl! As a daughter of a narcissist myself I applaud the choices you made! You are a fantastic role-model for kindness and understanding.\n\nFrom the outside it's a clear NTA. You made all the right choices for all the right reasons. Plus, I think most people who have periods can agree that just because you're \"emotional\" doesn't mean you no longer make sentient choices. Your sister also has a shiny back bone and she knew when to stand up for herself, even after birthing a human being.\n\nYou guys are both awesome!", "NTA OP.  It seems like your mom has a terminal case of Main Character Syndrome, which is why she blew off K as \u201ctrying to take away her day\u201d.  I think K is right in not letting them meet her baby.", "NTA in any way. You are the hero of the day! You were the only one to act appropriately in this situation. No one can take that away from you. The others are just selfish people that want their way at all times, not willing to be held accountable for the narcissism. \n\nBe strong for you, your niece and your sister. They are enjoying their new life together, something that you helped make happen. I, for one, am very proud that you are you.", "NTA"]}
