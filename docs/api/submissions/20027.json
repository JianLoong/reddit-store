K\u2019s water broke mid way through the party but when K tried to tell our mother and new husband they said K was just trying to take away her day. Everyone else at the party just brushed her off. I, having witnessed it all offered to take K to the hospital. We got to the hospital about 30 minutes after her water had broke. Within the hour my beautiful niece was born. She was even named after me. K posted a picture of me holding A as her baby announcement. Text came flooding in asking when our family could meet the baby. K was having none of it she told everyone included our mom and step dad that they were not to see the baby because no one wanted to help her. Soon after they had spoke to K my phone was blowing up with texts and calls from our mother telling me to talk to K to change her mind about seeing A. She said it was her birthday and they she didn\u2019t think was actually in labor. I told her no that everyone needed to respect K\u2019s decision. She along with a bunch of other family members are calling me the a$$hole for not trying to change my sisters mind right after giving birth.
