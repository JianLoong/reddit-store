{"id": 25605, "submission_id": "162ispm", "title": "AITA for not helping out a girl who humiliated me in front of other people?", "selftext": "Important background. I (19M) was friends with Lisa(19F), and had a few other people in our friend group. I met these people in my freshmen year and I wouldn't consider them super close friends, but we all hung out atleast once a week while we were in school. I began to develop feelings for Lisa and decided to ask her out over text around May of 2023. I asked her if she wanted to get dinner with me and she responded with \"just the two of us?\". I said yes and she left me on read. I was hoping for atleast a yes or no and was nervous that things would be awkward the next time we all hung out. \n\nWell, the next time we all hung out was at the library doing a group study for a class we were all in. She came a bit late and as soon as she sat down, she turned to me and said, \"OP I would go on a date with you but you're too short for me. Honestly, guys under 5'10 shouldn't exist. I would just see you as my little brother or a friend.\" She started laughing and so were the other girls. My guy friends were just quiet and sat there awkwardly. I was a little disappointed they didn't defend me but oh well. For reference, I'm 5'7 and she's 5'3. I was embarassed and said \"you could have said that in private\". I ended up leaving early and limited my hangouts with that group. In the few times I did hangout with them, Lisa acted like there was nothing going on between us. \n\nFast forward to August, Lisa texted in the groupchat asking if anybody would be able to lend her $750 for her housing deposit. She was frantic and explained that her parents were kicking her out for \"personal problems\" and needed to put down her housing deposit, otherwise her on campus housing contract would be terminated and she wouldn't have a place to stay. Everyone in the groupchat said they couldn't help her and they wish they could. That's when Lisa decided to privately message me. \n\nIt's no secret that my family is well off and we don't have any struggles. This came up when we were talking about financial aid and how much we're getting etc. She asked if she could borrow $750 from me and that she would pay me back as soon as possible. I was furious and told her no, questioning how she could ask me after she embarassed me in front of everybody back in May. That's when she said that she was getting kicked out because she was gay and that's why she rejected me like that. She didn't want her friends knowing that either. She was basically begging me as she wouldn't have a place to stay if she didn't pay her housing deposit. I told her that it wasn't my problem and promptly blocked her. This led to me getting a flurry of messages from my \"friends\" in the group who accused me of having no heart and to grow up and deal with rejection. I blocked all of them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693117973, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162ispm/aita_for_not_helping_out_a_girl_who_humiliated_me/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not sure why she feels entitled to your family's money.  It's clear she isn't interested in actually being your friend. Hopefully the other friends come around and if not then find new friends. It's not easy either way.", "NTA She didn\u2019t want to be humiliated so decided to humiliate you?  She could have rejected you in private and explained why and would no-one have known. That way you\u2019d have kept a good relationship and possibly would have been willing to lend the money but she didn\u2019t she decided to distract from her by making you the center of ridicule.\n\nMade her bed and now gets to lie in it.", "NTA\n\nLisa didn't have to humiliate you. She did this to be seen as a \"cool girl\", not to hide sexual orientation.\n\nAs for your \"friends\" - in situations like this one, when no one can help, there is always a great solution: they can help as a group. They don't have 750$, but they can contribute 50-100$. Problem solved.", "NTA. It's her problem. Moreover, you will be worse off if you end up with people who belittle someone due to their height or if they prefer someone with certain height.", "NTA. You are not obligated to lend anyone money at all, let alone someone who was needlessly cruel to you in public. She didn't need to do that; she could have rejected you privately, as you said. Her friends didn't know you'd asked her out so there's no reason she would need to reject you publicly just to seem not gay.\n\nThis isn't your problem. She can start a GoFundMe if she needs to, or speak to administrators at your school about this delicate and difficult situation.", "OP definitely NTA and you learned the lesson early on that she is just a grifter.  Saying now that she's a lesbian, after she told you in front of a bunch of nearly total strangers that guys shorter than 5'10\" shouldn't exist shows what a demeaning person she is until she actually needs help from someone and is desperate enough to say anything to get it.  Karma got her good definitely, and glad that you stood your ground.  Good luck at school and gaining better friends.", "nta, if they are crapping at you to give her money,  why don't they put their money where their mouth is.?", "NTA.   \nShe doesn\u2019t have to put other people down to hide her gayness\u2026 she doesn\u2019t have to be spiteful to stay in the closet. There were many other ways for her to do that which didn\u2019t involve insulting you.   \n\n\nTo then ask you for money and when you refuse let all the people around you know to pressure you shows she hasn\u2019t improved any. I\u2019d be tempted to jump back on that group chat and say \u201cHey Lisa, I don\u2019t lend money to people who intentionally publicly insult me, and then when I won\u2019t help get all their friends to ring me. Guess it shows who your real friends are when there\u2019s a bunch of people who think I should \u2018loan\u2019 money to a person who went out of their way to make me feel inadequate and small. Farewell.\u201d And drop out of the group chat.", "\\>Honestly, guys under 5'10 shouldn't exist.  \nNTA  \nOH wow, she is an awful person. This is an instant block and never talk to them again.   \nWhen she asked for the money she was manipulating you because she knew you had feelings for her. She was trying to exploit that. Good job OP blocking her.", "Massive NTA. You made the right move, OP. That's her problem, and plus you're not obligated to give her your money.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. It's weird that she feels entitled to your money.", "NTA that girl was just out of order and rude. I don\u2019t understand how shitty people expect other kind people to do nice things for them like no. That\u2019s not how it works. And pls do not like the height comment offend or upset you. For 1. You\u2019re not short like at all and for 2. Girls don\u2019t realise that sex with \u201cshorter guys\u201d is so, SO much better than taller guys.

Problem there solved.  Then she can publicly explain and apologise.", "NTA.\n\nThere was no need for her to be mean, and because I'm a cynical bitch, I wouldn't mind she's playing the 'I'm gay' card for sympathy. How did your other friends find out that you had told her no? - because she told them I'll bet ...\n\nReal friends don't act all entitled over other friends' money.", "She won\u2019t suddenly like you if you kind her the money and she will never pay it back.

There\u2019s no way any of this will be if any benefit to you.", "NTA - She has no entitlement to your money and regardless of ANY \"good reasons\" you are not an asshole for saying no. I mean if you owed her money, then sure, but this is a pure \"please give me money\" request. Nothing at all wrong with saying no. As for the friends, I would've done the same...how rude of them", "NTA she was unnecessarily cruel to you because of her own personal issues.  No one deserves to be humiliated like that. That whole group sounds like a bunch of jerks.  I\u2019m shocked that she had the nerve to ask you. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if she had the nerve to not pay you back if you had loaned her the money. You did the right thing.", "NTA: Rejection is one thing, humiliating someone on purpose is just wrong. Go NC with everyone!", "NTA\nGood for you stand your ground. The utter sheer disrespect she had for you by belittling you in front of the group to feed her ego is appalling.\nThen other members of the group laughing with her at you.
