I (19M) was friends with Lisa(19F), and had a few other people in our friend group. I met these people in my freshmen year and I wouldn't consider them super close friends, but we all hung out atleast once a week while we were in school. I began to develop feelings for Lisa and decided to ask her out over text around May of 2023. I asked her if she wanted to get dinner with me and she responded with \"just the two of us?\". I said yes and she left me on read. I was hoping for atleast a yes or no and was nervous that things would be awkward the next time we all hung out. \n\nWell, the next time we all hung out was at the library doing a group study for a class we were all in. She came a bit late and as soon as she sat down, she turned to me and said, \"OP I would go on a date with you but you're too short for me. Honestly, guys under 5'10 shouldn't exist. I would just see you as my little brother or a friend.\" She started laughing and so were the other girls. My guy friends were just quiet and sat there awkwardly. I was a little disappointed they didn't defend me but oh well. For reference, I'm 5'7 and she's 5'3. I was embarassed and said \"you could have said that in private\". I ended up leaving early and limited my hangouts with that group. In the few times I did hangout with them, Lisa acted like there was nothing going on between us. \n\nFast forward to August, Lisa texted in the groupchat asking if anybody would be able to lend her $750 for her housing deposit. She was frantic and explained that her parents were kicking her out for \"personal problems\" and needed to put down her housing deposit, otherwise her on campus housing contract would be terminated and she wouldn't have a place to stay. Everyone in the groupchat said they couldn't help her and they wish they could. That's when Lisa decided to privately message me. \n\nIt's no secret that my family is well off and we don't have any struggles. This came up when we were talking about financial aid and how much we're getting etc. She asked if she could borrow $750 from me and that she would pay me back as soon as possible. I was furious and told her no, questioning how she could ask me after she embarassed me in front of everybody back in May. That's when she said that she was getting kicked out because she was gay and that's why she rejected me like that. She didn't want her friends knowing that either. She was basically begging me as she wouldn't have a place to stay if she didn't pay her housing deposit. I told her that it wasn't my problem and promptly blocked her. This led to me getting a flurry of messages from my \"friends\" in the group who accused me of having no heart and to grow up and deal with rejection. I blocked all of them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693117973, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162ispm/aita_for_not_helping_out_a_girl_who_humiliated_me/", "score": 2751, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They have to be aware of your distancing yourself from her. If they think this girl needs free money so badly, they should give it to her themselves. They all got the same request as you did, after all, just publically, instead of privately, and they all said no. Fair enough, maybe you're more able to help out financially, but at this point, she's their friend, not yours. They could have gotten together as a group and come up with the money together if they really thought she deserved the help, or suggested talking to someone at the school to help her. \n\nIt seems like she knew you'd say no, that's why she messaged you privately, unlike the rest of the group.

They feel guilty about being unable or unwilling to help her, and think you should do so just because they can't or won't. \n\nYou owe this girl nothing. Even without the previous rejection, this is a lot of money and you have no reason to give her any of it. Her housing is her responsibility. If her actual friends wish to help her out in some way, fine, that's up to them, but she's no longer your friend.\n\nBy the way, being well off doesn't automatically mean you have money to spare. You may be getting your tuition paid by parents with no loans or grants, and maybe have a bit more disposable cash for wants as well as needs, but that doesn't mean you have over $700 lying around to give to some girl you're no longer friends with.

That doesn\u2019t excuse it at all.", "Why would you let someone offend you for being short?  Being shamed in front of friends is what was done for OP.", "That's the wild part to me. She doesn't like OP, fine. She's not attracted to shorter men, fine. \n\nBut that all men under a particular height shouldn't even exist? Fuck off, Miss Eugenics.", "Just an FYI, not all 18-19 year olds HAVE $50-100 and so no, they CANT always help. I know some adults who also can\u2019t spare that much, either.", "Exactly. Like\u2026I get maybe telling someone you wouldn\u2019t date them because of something they could change? Like if it was because OP came off as an entitled asshole or something because then maybe there could have been some introspection and changing that for the future. But no one has control over how tall they are or can just magically grow taller.", "Completely different things. She\u2019s an asshole but doesn\u2019t deserve to be outed", "And it's not like she panicked and blurted out something. She left him on read at least for a day (it kinda sounds like it was much longer than that). She had time to think of a proper rejection, but still decided to go about it like that.", "Cheers bud", "> Except she could've simply said \"she wasn't into him\", or just \"saw him as a friend\"\n\nBut that doesn't say \"I date men\" the why \"I would date you if you were a different kind of man\" does", "5'3\", and anybody who has an issue with it will get verbally flayed and flambeed, all with a grin on my face.", ">She left him on read at least for a day \n\nI'm old, wtf does this mean please?", "\"You're just not my type.\" No, she decided to be cruel, she decided to humiliate him to elevate herself.", "I get it that there is still a lot of stigma and it is still not easy to come out but seriously I thought everybody under 25 is more relaxed about their friends being gay . I get being afraid coming out 20 years ago but now to friends ?", "why is it easy to be cruel , kindness takes stength ? that makes no sense to me because I got burned too like I helped and it backfired but now I just help when I can and it doesn't has negative consequances for me so it is easy to be kind when you don't expect anything . He shouldn't help her even if she didn't embarassed him unless he doesn't mind losing the $750. So many ppl who have money problem won't fix it  and you lose friends anyway . you always have to run after borrowed money , it is rare they just give it back to you.", "Nah-- he's fine with his response.  The \"mikveh\" he's doing for her is helping her to learn that actions have consequences and deliberately setting out to humiliate someone publicly makes you a person who does not deserve any kindness or consideration from your victim.", "It means she saw his message, and didn't message him back or respond in any way, for longer than a day", ">\"You're just not my type.\"\n\n\"You're just not my type\" does not communicate that she would date men. Her type might also be women.\n\nLook, I'm not defending her. What she did was shitty. I was only explaining the **logic** of why she didn't do it in public and why she decided to publicly announce that she totally would date him if he were a different kind of **man**. Obviously there are a million ways she could have done that better.", "The chance of the info getting back to her parents would've made it risky to let friends know (never know who has loose lips, will inform her parents in revenge, or have misplaced righteousness and think her hiding it is wrong).\n\nHer public humiliation of OP to supposedly hide the fact she's gay? I'm thinking she's a mean girl at heart and did it for the laughs, not to hide her sexuality.", "There\u2019s no panic reaction there. That was clearly something she planned. OP texted her privately asking her out, no one would\u2019ve known if she\u2019d just rejected him then. Instead she doesn\u2019t reply and waits days to tell him in public that she doesn\u2019t want to date him because he\u2019s short. That\u2019s not a panic reaction at all.", "I dont think you know what panic reaction means", "Thank you.", "So what did the line about short men shouldn't exist add to the rejection?\n\nThat's like saying a closeted gay guy is okay to say, \"Nah I won't date you, you slept with another guy and that's kinda whorish.\"", "She could have said the same by message, why choosing public?", "Her family already knows.\n\n>That's when she said that she was getting kicked out because she was gay and that's why she rejected me like that.", "You're welcome"]}
