I (19M) was friends with Lisa(19F), and had a few other people in our friend group. I met these people in my freshmen year and I wouldn't consider them super close friends, but we all hung out atleast once a week while we were in school. I began to develop feelings for Lisa and decided to ask her out over text around May of 2023. I asked her if she wanted to get dinner with me and she responded with \"just the two of us?\". I said yes and she left me on read. I was hoping for atleast a yes or no and was nervous that things would be awkward the next time we all hung out. \n\nWell, the next time we all hung out was at the library doing a group study for a class we were all in. She came a bit late and as soon as she sat down, she turned to me and said, \"OP I would go on a date with you but you're too short for me. Honestly, guys under 5'10 shouldn't exist. I would just see you as my little brother or a friend.\" She started laughing and so were the other girls. My guy friends were just quiet and sat there awkwardly. I was a little disappointed they didn't defend me but oh well. For reference, I'm 5'7 and she's 5'3. I was embarassed and said \"you could have said that in private\". I ended up leaving early and limited my hangouts with that group. In the few times I did hangout with them, Lisa acted like there was nothing going on between us. \n\nFast forward to August, Lisa texted in the groupchat asking if anybody would be able to lend her $750 for her housing deposit. She was frantic and explained that her parents were kicking her out for \"personal problems\" and needed to put down her housing deposit, otherwise her on campus housing contract would be terminated and she wouldn't have a place to stay. Everyone in the groupchat said they couldn't help her and they wish they could. That's when Lisa decided to privately message me. \n\nIt's no secret that my family is well off and we don't have any struggles. This came up when we were talking about financial aid and how much we're getting etc. She asked if she could borrow $750 from me and that she would pay me back as soon as possible. I was furious and told her no, questioning how she could ask me after she embarassed me in front of everybody back in May. That's when she said that she was getting kicked out because she was gay and that's why she rejected me like that. She didn't want her friends knowing that either. She was basically begging me as she wouldn't have a place to stay if she didn't pay her housing deposit. I told her that it wasn't my problem and promptly blocked her. This led to me getting a flurry of messages from my \"friends\" in the group who accused me of having no heart and to grow up and deal with rejection. I blocked all of them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693117973, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162ispm/aita_for_not_helping_out_a_girl_who_humiliated_me/", "score": 214, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This whole thing is weird because if she just told him she was gay in private and asked him to promise not to tell anyone, and they continued as friends, he would probably be willing to give the money. She just couldn't help being an asshole.", "She didn\u2019t even need to mention she was gay. A simple \u201csorry I don\u2019t see you like that\u201d should have sufficed.", "She could\u2019ve easily told him that she likes him as a person but has no romantic interest in him", "This is exactly how I feel, you said it perfectly - she could have told him \"no\"  and that would have been okay but she rejected him in the most hurtful and insulting way.", ">but you\u2019re an asshole for not doing it solely because she hurt your feelings once. ESH.\n\n\nBullshit. \n\nIt doesn't matter what his reason(s) are. No one is entitled to anyone's money especially not the one who only came up with an excuse when Op became her an option. \n\nAnd is she sorry? Nope. Cos how is Op getting ganged up on others now?", "No he doesn't.", "Anyone OP has any tenuous relationship with is due money from OP. Is that your position? Just want to understand.", ">You're all childish. You all could have behaved differently. And no, you weren't an a for refusing to lend this person money.\n\n\n\nWhat a bunch of contradiction. \n\nYou are all childish even though you did nothing wrong", "And on so many levels...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe initial rejection is always hurtful, but people have the right to reject people they are not into. Still smarts, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen she tells him it is because of his height, in front of all their friends, which is quite rude.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut THEN she says short guys shouldn't even exist!!!! That's just...", "NTA completely, What goes around comes around and if the friends are so much interested then they could all chip in $100 each by sacrificing some of their lunch money, hobbies etc.  Lisa is an asshole irrespective of her gender, sexual orientation and wealth.", "I had to come back to this comment twice because I thought for a brief moment that was the middle finger emotion. \ud83d\ude04", "\"Nope, not feeling it. Sorry.\"", "I am wondering if she is actually gay and not just using this as an excuse to pull on Ops heartstrings so he would front up the cash and possibly say no to being paid back", "And she did that to hide the fact she is gay? That\u2019s a weird excuse", "I'm thinking she is being less than truthful."]}
