Bio dad should have rights (and obligations) for his children. And why do you care about any financial hardship for your ex? She caused this.", "NTA in anyway possible. you did what everybody (including you) wanted EXCEPT your mom. who cares what she thinks", "NTA\n\nThe girls were already being distanced from you, both emotionally and geographically. There is not much there for them or you in the relationship. Keeping your parental rights also presumably comes with obligations.\n\nIt seems like your ex would find ways to leverage your parental rights against you given the opportunity.\n\nTrying to be an involved parent with a co-parent who is actively sabotaging you is exhausting and super draining even if the kids are yours and are keen to see you.\n\nI think you are best to wash your hands of the situation.\n\nIt sounds like your mom is grieving the loss of what she saw as her grandkids. Even though she understands the reality, the emotional loss of the happy life she probably envisioned as their grandma might be at play here, even if she isn't letting on. People who are grieving this kind of loss don't always figure out how to do it well. Give her grace.\n\nGood luck building your new life without your toxic ex!", "If you weren\u2019t their biological parent and he is, I don\u2019t see how you would have maintained custody of them. You probably did the right thing. It sucks but there\u2019s no way I can see a court giving you custody in the end.", "NTA. Your ex is the AH for her lying and cheating. She created this reality.", "NTA. I really have no idea as to why mom would have an issue with signing over rights. It\u2019s your decision to make, she should respect that. I can only speculate it is because she wants grandkids. If that\u2019s the case she\u2019s being selfish, and un-empathetic to your situation.\n\nThen mom goes to shame you as it\u2019s somehow your fault by putting ex in debt, because bio dad wants custody? First, none of that so your fault or your problem. Mom is being downright toxic in her behavior in regards to this. \n\nAfter rereading I wasn\u2019t sure if it was mom, sister, or both of them ganging up on you. Do they do this often? Invalidate, criticize, or berate you on your decisions? I feel like that is common for you, but cannot be sure.", "definitely nta. it's clear that you've put a lot of thought and consideration into your decision. the fact that you weren't even biologically related to the children makes it understandable that you would want to give the bio father the chance to have a relationship with them. it's unfortunate that your ex's actions have led to her incurring such high costs but that doesn't make you an ah. you did what you believed was best for the children and that's what matters.", "NTA\n\nThe genetic testing gave you no legal ground to stand on and it sounds like there's little to no emotional relationship with the girls due to their mom's actions even if YOU feel some on your end. If your mom has been allowed to maintain an emotional relationship with the girls, that's wonderful, but you are in ***no*** way an asshole for bowing out.", "Dude.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBro.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuck", "NTA. What a mess. And I would invite your mother to mind her own and keep her opinion on the matter to herself.", "OP you're NTA for walking away from the situation.  Sign off on the divorce, walk away from them, and start a new chapter.  Your ex is going to bring nothing but misery to anyone she encounters and you need to allow yourself to heal.  There's no point in reliving bad history, especially when you said it's been \"6 years in the making,\" so just focus on yourself for a while and tell everyone else to just let it go if it gets brought up anymore.", "NTA - Bio dad has rights, and if you and the kids weren\u2019t actually in a parent/child relationship then you didn\u2019t really do anything bad.  Your hopefully soon to be ex just learned about the second half of the phrase fuck around and find out.  Move on my dude, better times are just around the corner from you.", "If the kids don\u2019t view you as their dad, deff NTA", "NTA.\n\nThis is a very clear example of your ex having literally fucked around and found out. All of her problems are consequences of her actions", "NTA - I am so sorry you didn\u2019t discover this earlier.", "Only you can answer this one, dude. The fact that bio dad is costing ex money is not your concern. And you say that your oldest doesn't even recognize you as a father. So, imho, NTA. You don't want to be a parent (of these children) and it appears you are off the hook.", "NTA. Who cares how much it costs your ex wife? It shouldn\u2019t matter to you or your mom. Your ex FAFO.", "Wow this is difficult.  Definitely NTA.  You didn't really have a relationship with either child and their bio dad wants one.  Sounds like you did what was best for them.  (Your sister is an asshole for trying to make you feel guilty and responsible for your ex's finances.). This is a lot to go through though.  Get therapy if you need help, even if it's only a few months.  Be kind to yourself and don't let your sister make you doubt yourself.", "Nta\n\nNot your circus, not your monkeys. Grats on no child support, sorry for losing a kid.", "nta. you did what was best for the children and considered their well-being. it's unfortunate that it has caused financial strain for your ex but ultimately you made a difficult decision based on the facts presented to you. stay strong and keep prioritizing the children's happiness.", "nta. you did the right thing by giving the bio father rights since he was suing for them. it's unfortunate that your ex has incurred so much debt but ultimately it's her responsibility for challenging the paternity and causing the legal battle. you made a difficult decision based on the best interests of the children involved.", "NTA. Good decision.", "NTA  The children don't see you as their dad anyway. If you can prove that she knew the children weren't yours then you can also sue her for fraud.", "NTA", "Absolutely NTA! \n\nLooks like a 'get out of jail free card' to me. You're just setting things right. Hope their dad gets custody. At least he's fighting. \n\nYou are free to move about the cabin", "NTA. \n\nIt would be different if you were refusing to see them or had actively disowned them after being their Daddy for years. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re still going to be there for them if they ever want you to. Signing over your rights doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t send them Christmas and birthday presents. You may even be able to work out visitation with their bio father, if you want, and if they want it. \n\nKids can have more than one dad. You\u2019re giving them the opportunity to grow up with their bio dad who clearly wants to play that role in their lives. And by doing so without a fight, you\u2019re helping to avoid drama, to the extent that this is possible.", "NTA.  Your sister's opinion is irrelevant.  You were put in a lousy position based on a series of lies.  You had no way of sorting this out without there being a mess involved.", "nah. it's a tough situation to be in but ultimately you did what you felt was best for everyone involved. it's understandable that your ex might be upset about the legal fees but you can't be blamed for wanting to do what's right for your kids even if they aren't biologically yours.", "6 years in the making? what was your lawyer doing if you had one 6 years ago? I really feel sorry for those little girls. technically, you\u2019re not a bio dad. a good lawyer can suggest your rights and what you are NOT legally required to do. If you legally adopt the girls, I can understand the part of siging to surrender. but if you never adopted them, no need to sign on anything", "NTA. What\u2019s wrong with your mom?", "NTA. You can still maintain contact with and show caring for the girls. It won't hurt them to have another caring adult in their lives.", "Nta, it\u2019s hurtful, but they\u2019re not yours.", "NTA - Seems like you don't have much of a relationship with them either. The bio father has a right to be apart of their lives. Hopefully now you can continue with the divorce, it's been too many years already.", "NTA\n\nYou are giving their true father his rights. You are removing yourself from liability and responsibility of children that don't even think of you as dad. As the saying goes, \"Not your monkeys, not your circus.\"", "NTA, Glad your out of that toxic relationship.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have to pay support for kids that aren\u2019t yours.", "NTA - why is it your problem that your ex has legal fees? If she had been honest about the paternity in the first place (or you know, not cheated) this all could've been avoided.", "NTA. Sadly, they are not your kids. Your ex lied to you and used you for years, and never planned to tell you that you were not their father. You have this opportunity to walk away clean and I think you're right to take it. However, you need to make sure your name is not on their birth certificates and that you have absolutely NO child support obligations.\n\nI'm so sorry that awful woman did this to you, and I'm glad her karma finally showed up. Ignore your mother and tell your sister to STFU. This is not something she should be discussing.", "NTA.\n\nYou bit the b u l l e i t.  The court systems aren\u2019t going by what\u2019s right they\u2019re going by what they can get away with.  Neither kid is biologically yours, so giving custody to the bio dad who does want custody is the smart decision.  You\u2019re saving up to 18 years of child support to support kids you didn\u2019t make.  You paved the way for the bio dad to be able to at least partially raise his own kids.  Your ex cheated.  She claimed the kids were yours.  She\u2019s paying now for court fees and attorney bills.  Kinda getting what\u2019s due.", "NTA. You barely have a relationship with the oldest, and there was no time to build one with the youngest. I have a suspicion that her current financial situation is of her own making by prolonging the divorce process.", "My cousin was in this situation.  He was raised to believe his Dad was his Dad.  Around when he was eleven, it was revealed that his Dad was not his bio Dad and the man he knew as his Dad cut off contact and everything.  My cousin was devastated, even though they had only seen each other on the holidays, and for a week at summer, he thought that this man was his Dad and after his Dad left him, my cousin had thought for years that his Dad didn\u2019t want him.  It wasn\u2019t till he was in his early twenties did he find out what happened.  His Dad totally wrote him off, and in his mind, a man that he loved and had hoped he could live with full time one day, and then he was gone and told his Dad didn\u2019t want him.  It scarred my cousin for his life, and his life ended short and after a great deal of pain.  His mom married an alcoholic, chaos was the norm, and he never felt loved.  I would really think about this, your daughter, for 8 years, will wonder why, what happened, where you went, and as she grows up, you will be the scape goat for her abandonment issues, as her mother will make certain of that.  And what about your parents, do they have interactions with these kids? Do these kids see them as the grandparents? You and your family may be the best and only stable influences in their lives.   Would you be the AH, no, but could you be a hero and at least try and fight for them? Will that matter as they grow up? Likely.  Have your attorney have another dna test done, make sure it\u2019s done by a reputable source that is using control methods that no one can interfere with.  Once you do this thing, there is no going back and a big potential for terrible consequences for these kid\u2019s psychological health.  Make sure the facts are the facts and that these kids will be in good loving hands if you choose to walk away.  You may be the only person who can ensure that they are safe.", "INFO: \n\nGuessing she was cheating on you? Were you listed as their father on the birth certificate?", "YTA. You thought these were your children for 8 years and never gave a fuck about them or tried to build a relationship", "All of these adults just caring about themselves and not a word about the massive impact to the children\n\nESH", "Yes", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
