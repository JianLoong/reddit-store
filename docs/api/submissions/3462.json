I started taking weightloss medication and seeing a nutritionist who has helped greatly. We made a plan where it doesn\u2019t feel as restrictive as a normal diet, but helps to keep me from pigging out around dinner. I still get to eat what I like, just in moderation. Additionally, I go to the gym everyday, doing a 30 minute weight lifting circuit (3 times a week) and an elliptical workout (30-60 minutes).\n \nThis is the first time I have ever really seen progress in losing weight as I\u2019ve lost around 10 pounds. Plus, I figured out how much I love going to the gym. I\u2019m really proud of myself.\n \nThe point is that I don\u2019t like being fat. I want to be healthy, be able to have kids and watch them grow up, to feel more attractive and not hate every photo of myself, to be able to do an actual push up for the first time in my entire life, to comfortably fit in an airplane seat and not have my hip rubbing up against the person next to me. Aside from that, I have goals for life beyond my weight and I want to have enough time to accomplish them (writing a book, getting my pilot\u2019s license, get my bachelor\u2019s degree). I\u2019m making progress towards this.\n \nI don\u2019t like talking much about my weight with my family because they\u2019re incredibly judgmental, but at Thanksgiving, they found a way to bring it up anyways, saying how I looked like I had put on a few pounds since September and asking how this all was affecting my health. While I tried to brush it off, my mother was more than willing to tell everyone about my issues. Everything from my antidepressants to how she\u2019s hardly seen a change in my eating habits, to how she\u2019s found snack wrappers in my trash, me taking a break from school, my ex-boyfrined, everything they didn\u2019t need to know.

Your doctor may be able to recommend someone, or even find something online.  I'm not familiar with any social media groups you could look into, but hopefully another redditor can help with that.

You should be proud of yourself for losing those first 10 pounds - you\u2019re kicking ass and taking control of your future in a healthy, responsible and realistic way (following medical advice from a doctor rather than starving yourself, fad diets or those shakes that, apparently, make you shit your brains out). Please don\u2019t let your toxic family members put any doubt in your head and cause you to back slide into old behaviors. I\u2019m not sure what their damage is that they felt that all of this was appropriate to talk about amongst themselves, but that had to feel very violating. Your struggles should never be used as entertainment for others. You would be well within your rights to tell your mother (as calmly as possible) what actions of hers were at issue on Thanksgiving, giving her specific instances, telling her exactly how it made you feel and giving her clear boundaries about what will and will not be accepted by you going forward and what the consequences will be if she cross the line. The consequences could be something as simple as you not providing her with any information about your health choices going forward, calmly standing up, telling her on the spot that her behavior is crossing the line while she is doing it and promptly leaving the gathering (if this is something she should do again), or just telling her that you won\u2019t be joining any future events with her/going NC if she continues with this pattern of behavior. If I\u2019m being frank, I\u2019m a petty asshole and would have zero issue interrupting my mother in front of the whole group, reminding her that I already told her how awful she is making me feel, point out that her continuing to do so shows she doesn\u2019t care about my feelings and then following through on the consequences. While I\u2019m not normally one for public shaming, your mom sounds like she could use a healthy dose of it when it comes to a situation like this. \n\nPlease don\u2019t allow your mother to gaslight you into apologizing - you didn\u2019t violate her trust by sharing private/sensitive information with the group\u2026she did. You remained calm until the end of dinner and then left - you were the \u201cadult\u201d in the situation, not your gossipy mom. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your family is pulling this on you.

If you can get away and cut them off, I strongly encourage you to do so.", "NTA You didn't ruin anything! Your mom is inconsiderate and unsupportive when she should be.

That said there is some evidence that positive reinforcement can help people stick with their goals and when it comes to your health it might be worth getting a few people in your corner to cheer you on. I personally have seen friends succeed or fail at this exact struggle because they either had a strong support base or had one which encouraged unhealthy behavior. Find supportive people and stick with them.\n\nBest of luck, it\u2019s not an easy task but it will absolutely be worth it in the long run.", "NTA, your family sucks ass.

A shame your family is more toxic than sensitive and supportive.\n\nThere might be some sabotage going on here ... it's common when someone in a family makes a big life change like this, some other family members will undermine, not wanting the person to change, to be in charge of their own life. It's a control issue, also maybe jealousy. Going low-contact might be necessary.\n\nAs a lifelong person of size, I've read a lot about this scenario although did not experience it in my own family.\n\nETA: I hope you have someone you can count on to have your back, be a support system, both in health care and emotional/psychological support.", "NTA - Weight loss is hard. There is also no easy way out. Even people who get surgery to help still have to stick to a strict diet or risk gaining weight back. There are so many components that go into it; most importantly are exercise, diet, and mental health. You are still in need of some serious mental motivation to keep you going and help you realize that being hard on yourself isn't going to help you here. Keep setting goals and working towards them. I recommend small and achievable goals so you can see progress. Also, it's a process and everyone slips, and sometimes our bodies just don't want to cooperate. You might hit a bump in the road where you take a step backwards. It's okay. Brush it off and keep going. You're doing great. Negative people in your life should be removed or limited. I would speak to those around you and let them know that you have goals and you are working on them, and to please not discuss your journey with others as it is not having a positive effect on your.

She violated your privacy and doesn't recognize boundaries. Do you! When you've accomplished just one, update us. Keep updating as each one is ticked off with completion. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nWith all due respect fuuuuuuuuuuuck your mom, that is a complete invasion of privacy, then she had the gall to be mad at you for being upset??\n\nKeep up your goals!", "NTA.", "NTA.

Your family, especially your mother, were the AH by picking at you about issues they have to know are painful for you.  You did the right thing by noping out instead of some thunderous denunciation.

In fact, both of those conditions are usually genetic.\n\nObviously exercise is good for you (it\u2019s good for pretty much everyone), but it doesn\u2019t have a significant effect on weight.

That plus, you will know you can accomplish anything you set your mind to.\n\nWith all that being said, you have one (maybe 2) more things to do to get you on, and keep you on the right track. First, cut out the toxic family. Just go no contact they are not good for you, your dreams or your health. Cut ties and do not look back. Or at least wait until you are at a place that you are happy and confident with yourself and show up as someone they don't recognize on the inside and the out. Second, if you haven't already, look into therapy. We (as in people as a whole in general) tend to not take our mental health and well being as seriously as we take our physical. Thankfully times are changing and mental health is becoming more important. Just like a nutritionist is helping with your diet choices and eating habits a therapist can help with eating habits as well as ways to help keep yourself encouraged, and of course help with any problems that come from the insecurities you have. Im sorry if all that was worded badly, I think everyone no matter what would benefit from therapy to whatever degree they need. \n\nSo, again I want to say, NTA NTA NT NTA X10000 in any way shape or form. Your family should be absolutely disgusted and ashamed of themselves for not only acting like that but doing it for so long that they have made you feel like their toxicity is your responsibility.

When you change for the better (feel better about yourself, able to move better, can find clothes that make you happy about what you see in the mirror, have more energy - all consequences of losing fat and gaining muscle) the change in you will drastically change your family dynamic. People who have always said, \"I'm not trying to criticize you - I'm trying to help, because I just want you to feel healthy\" will suddenly be compelled to undermine you. It sounds as though that's already happening. And, I'm sorry to say, this can also affect romantic relationships, so please be prepared.\n\nYou need to distance yourself and create a safe space around yourself. I don't mean going LC, but stop sharing ANY information about your wellness journey. What you eat, what you accomplish at the gym, changes in clothing size - those are nobody's business. Don't tolerate any comment, including \"compliments\" - and if they won't shut up about your body, end the conversation and, if necessary, leave. (You're not causing a scene when you define a boundary and then quietly remove yourself when people violate it. The people who scream at you for that - they're the ones causing a scene.)\n\nI also encourage you to try to find a strong support group. Overeaters Anonymous is very helpful because they don't promote any specific food or exercise plans - their approach is all about building relationships that help you change your self-talk, as part of transforming your unhealthy relationship with food into a healthy one, and the process you follow to achieve that is entirely up to you.

'Oh no, OP is escaping her fat box, we have to shove her back in there!' That's why there were no encouraging words, just disparaging remarks about you weight and your life in general- they need you to keep playing the role they have cast you in.\n\nOP, take a deep breath. You are just starting your weight loss journey and already you can see and feel results. It's a slow and steady process- some weeks you'll advance quite nicely, other weeks you will have setbacks. Don't give up just keep working at it. Please skip Christmas with your family- they do not have your best interests at heart. Find a gym that is open (or exercise at home) and have a good dinner. Your family environment is not healthy for you at this stage and will probably become more toxic as you come out of the 'fat box' i.e. lose more weight.\n\nCongratulations again on your weight loss.

Could that be?", "You sound like a lovely person who cares about your friends and wants to support them - and is willing to listen to how they want to be supported, and respect that.\n\nSadly, sometimes people like to act caring just so they can feel good about themself, and they don't bother to actually listen when the person explains what they need. It can be mega frustrating as well because they often get a lot of social cred for being nice, when uh... they're not really.\n\nFortunately, the world is also full of many amazing people, who genuinely care and want to help. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. But like. consider \"that environment just wasn't a healthy one\" as a statement extending to more than just Thanksgiving. SHE is the one who ruined it by using it as a pretext to bully you.

From the title I was expecting some gigantic \u201cI sat on the house and crushed all the people inside\u201d type of absurdity to \u201cruin\u201d thanksgiving. \n\nIn my experience, people resort to picking on others when they\u2019re uncomfortable, as a way to fill the awkward silence.

I\u2019m glad you are learning and doing better for yourself, physically and emotionally.", "You're NTA. Your family sounds pretty horrible. They should be supporting you, not judging you. Good for you,  removing yourself from that situation. And congratulations for taking control of yourself and making progress towards you goals.", "Hmmm. Have you had your thyroid checked? Medication wreaks havoc on your body, too, and you should be proud of yourself for all that you\u2019ve done. Getting my blood pressure and thyroid stabilized helped immensely when it came time for me to lose weight. Good luck, and take great care of yourself!", "YOU caused a scene?

You sound like you have a good handle on things and but your family unfortunately is not on your side, and won\u2019t be for a while. Keep on keeping on and ignore the haters (family or otherwise).\n\nETA: NTA of course", "NTA. I'm sorry your family thinks it's OK to talk about your body like you're not even in the fucking room.

Weren't you aware how fucking toxic your family has always been? Why did you even bother keeping in touch with them?\n\nFamily is not defined by blood. This is my favorite analogy of what a family is from a manga (forgot the name of the manga though):\n\"The world is a malicious place with malicious things coming in all directions. A family is a wall you can lean against in the world. Not only would the wall protect one side of you, but by leaning against the wall to fight, you would have a chance to win.\"\n\nAnything that does not serve the purpose of that wall, is NOT family.\nI bet these \"fake families\" were major contribution to your weight and health problems!\n\nJudgement: YTA to YOURSELF to not dump these fake families sooner", "NTA.

They were the rude ones and they caused whatever \"scene\" was going on.", "I\u2019ve also lost over 100 pounds and can attest to this. There are people I no longer speak to because they were so awful to me after I lost weight.

But the bigger issue is that, based on what you're saying about your mom's behavior, it looks like your family has gotten comfortable viewing you as \"the unhealthy one\" that they have to \"worry\" about.

She deliberately tried to sabotage you there.\n\nI have to add though, that getting pilot's license will be HARD if not impossible, even.

Nothing you did ruined Thanksgiving; if anything ruined it, it was your mom\u2019s behavior. I would advise you to not tell your mom any real details about your private life anymore, because she will just blabbermouth it to the rest of your family, whether you want that or not.

You literally said nothing, just got up and left.

I'm on the same weight loss journey and will be happy to give you moral support and just to be an ear. \n\nWhat your mother did was frankly, very cruel and she had no right to humiliate you that way.
