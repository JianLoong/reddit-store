I started taking weightloss medication and seeing a nutritionist who has helped greatly. We made a plan where it doesn\u2019t feel as restrictive as a normal diet, but helps to keep me from pigging out around dinner. I still get to eat what I like, just in moderation. Additionally, I go to the gym everyday, doing a 30 minute weight lifting circuit (3 times a week) and an elliptical workout (30-60 minutes).\n \nThis is the first time I have ever really seen progress in losing weight as I\u2019ve lost around 10 pounds. Plus, I figured out how much I love going to the gym. I\u2019m really proud of myself.\n \nThe point is that I don\u2019t like being fat. I want to be healthy, be able to have kids and watch them grow up, to feel more attractive and not hate every photo of myself, to be able to do an actual push up for the first time in my entire life, to comfortably fit in an airplane seat and not have my hip rubbing up against the person next to me. Aside from that, I have goals for life beyond my weight and I want to have enough time to accomplish them (writing a book, getting my pilot\u2019s license, get my bachelor\u2019s degree). I\u2019m making progress towards this.\n \nI don\u2019t like talking much about my weight with my family because they\u2019re incredibly judgmental, but at Thanksgiving, they found a way to bring it up anyways, saying how I looked like I had put on a few pounds since September and asking how this all was affecting my health. While I tried to brush it off, my mother was more than willing to tell everyone about my issues. Everything from my antidepressants to how she\u2019s hardly seen a change in my eating habits, to how she\u2019s found snack wrappers in my trash, me taking a break from school, my ex-boyfrined, everything they didn\u2019t need to know.

Your doctor may be able to recommend someone, or even find something online.  I'm not familiar with any social media groups you could look into, but hopefully another redditor can help with that.

You should be proud of yourself for losing those first 10 pounds - you\u2019re kicking ass and taking control of your future in a healthy, responsible and realistic way (following medical advice from a doctor rather than starving yourself, fad diets or those shakes that, apparently, make you shit your brains out). Please don\u2019t let your toxic family members put any doubt in your head and cause you to back slide into old behaviors. I\u2019m not sure what their damage is that they felt that all of this was appropriate to talk about amongst themselves, but that had to feel very violating. Your struggles should never be used as entertainment for others. You would be well within your rights to tell your mother (as calmly as possible) what actions of hers were at issue on Thanksgiving, giving her specific instances, telling her exactly how it made you feel and giving her clear boundaries about what will and will not be accepted by you going forward and what the consequences will be if she cross the line. The consequences could be something as simple as you not providing her with any information about your health choices going forward, calmly standing up, telling her on the spot that her behavior is crossing the line while she is doing it and promptly leaving the gathering (if this is something she should do again), or just telling her that you won\u2019t be joining any future events with her/going NC if she continues with this pattern of behavior. If I\u2019m being frank, I\u2019m a petty asshole and would have zero issue interrupting my mother in front of the whole group, reminding her that I already told her how awful she is making me feel, point out that her continuing to do so shows she doesn\u2019t care about my feelings and then following through on the consequences. While I\u2019m not normally one for public shaming, your mom sounds like she could use a healthy dose of it when it comes to a situation like this. \n\nPlease don\u2019t allow your mother to gaslight you into apologizing - you didn\u2019t violate her trust by sharing private/sensitive information with the group\u2026she did. You remained calm until the end of dinner and then left - you were the \u201cadult\u201d in the situation, not your gossipy mom. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your family is pulling this on you.

If you can get away and cut them off, I strongly encourage you to do so.", "NTA You didn't ruin anything! Your mom is inconsiderate and unsupportive when she should be.

That said there is some evidence that positive reinforcement can help people stick with their goals and when it comes to your health it might be worth getting a few people in your corner to cheer you on. I personally have seen friends succeed or fail at this exact struggle because they either had a strong support base or had one which encouraged unhealthy behavior. Find supportive people and stick with them.\n\nBest of luck, it\u2019s not an easy task but it will absolutely be worth it in the long run.", "NTA, your family sucks ass.

A shame your family is more toxic than sensitive and supportive.\n\nThere might be some sabotage going on here ... it's common when someone in a family makes a big life change like this, some other family members will undermine, not wanting the person to change, to be in charge of their own life. It's a control issue, also maybe jealousy. Going low-contact might be necessary.\n\nAs a lifelong person of size, I've read a lot about this scenario although did not experience it in my own family.\n\nETA: I hope you have someone you can count on to have your back, be a support system, both in health care and emotional/psychological support.", "NTA - Weight loss is hard. There is also no easy way out. Even people who get surgery to help still have to stick to a strict diet or risk gaining weight back. There are so many components that go into it; most importantly are exercise, diet, and mental health. You are still in need of some serious mental motivation to keep you going and help you realize that being hard on yourself isn't going to help you here. Keep setting goals and working towards them. I recommend small and achievable goals so you can see progress. Also, it's a process and everyone slips, and sometimes our bodies just don't want to cooperate. You might hit a bump in the road where you take a step backwards. It's okay. Brush it off and keep going. You're doing great. Negative people in your life should be removed or limited. I would speak to those around you and let them know that you have goals and you are working on them, and to please not discuss your journey with others as it is not having a positive effect on your.

She violated your privacy and doesn't recognize boundaries. Do you! When you've accomplished just one, update us. Keep updating as each one is ticked off with completion. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nWith all due respect fuuuuuuuuuuuck your mom, that is a complete invasion of privacy, then she had the gall to be mad at you for being upset??\n\nKeep up your goals!", "NTA.", "NTA. Youre fine, and doing amazing! Please remember that youre doing whats right for you even when others try to bring you down. And congrats on the loss, I wish you luck and hope you lose as much as you want! :)", "NTA.  You did everything right.  Working to turn your life around, congrats!  Your family, especially your mother, were the AH by picking at you about issues they have to know are painful for you.  You did the right thing by noping out instead of some thunderous denunciation.  Only thing I'll say is that if you wanted to slide out a tad more smoothly, were better you made up some excuse and told someone before bailing.  Understandable if that didn't occur to you when you were in a bad mood.", "NTA. These family members want you to be the scapegoat.  If you're the problem then they can pretend they have no problems.  \n\nAn adult child has the power to deny thier parents access to their lives.  If that's moving out ornjust leaving the table it's still within your power.", "Fully agree! Find supportive people, they are out there and will love you and lift you up. Also fully agree with avoiding Christmas and if asked why, be brutally honest. \u2764\ufe0f Keep it up! You're doing great!", "Good for you, OP! I've been there. When I was in the process of losing a lot of weight, I used to skip the potluck lunches at my place of employment. I just couldn't handle the temptation, so I stayed in my office, alone. So many people came to talk to me to \"make sure I was okay.\" (They wanted to make it all about them.) I never did get them to understand, so don't hold your breath\n\nKeep it up... ***you can do it!***", "Her mother* did. Sounds like the root of the issues.", "[deleted]", "Fully agreed! Im a big girl. But Im slowly trying to lose weight. I say NTA. You did the right thing by removing yourself from it. What she did wasnt right. But yes info diet and grey rocking. And please do check out that sub.", "NAH? Mom is definitely an asshole here.", "She\u2019s not disgusting now. Being fat doesn\u2019t mean someone is disgusting.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Is there any way you would have wanted people to react? Seems like a lot of people might have felt sad if they thought no one noticed they weren\u2019t there?", "I\u2019m living with her now but will be moving out in a couple weeks.\n\nThanks for your words of encouragement and hugs, it means a lot!", "Best of luck, and anytime you need a hug, let me know, I'm here for you!", "NTA. And more importantly, you are doing an amazing job! Congratulations on losing 10 lbs!! I know that wasn\u2019t easy, but you did it and this internet stranger is proud of you! Keep on reaching for those goals! You are capable, and you are a beautiful human being!", "You are the absolutely NTA. Sounds to me like you\u2019ve got a lot of good things going for you, and your family want to drag you down to make themselves feel better. I\u2019m sorry they treat you that way - I hope it\u2019s not making you feel less proud of your accomplishments.", "Wow, NTA. Your family (specifically your mom) sounds toxic as fuck.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re doing an amazing job so keep up the good work! Also, you don\u2019t have to be around anyone who belittles or hurts you - even if they\u2019re family.", "NTA - that behavior is toxic. Some people only thrive when they put others down so they feel better about themselves. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re related to such people, you deserve better.\n\nOn the plus - your outlook on what you want out of life  and working towards goals is amazing. Keep up all the awesome work, you\u2019ve got a great head on your shoulders!", "NTA, you should cut her out. She's trying to keep you dowm", "NTA and you didn\u2019t ruin Thanksgiving, your family did. \nI\u2019m so happy that you\u2019ve made progress on your goals. You should be proud of yourself, I\u2019m a stranger and I\u2019m proud of you. Making life changes is hard but you\u2019re doing it! Keep being good to yourself and don\u2019t listen to your family.", "NTA whatsoever.\n\nAnd by the way, I\u2019m proud of you for the changes you\u2019ve made. Changing habits isn\u2019t easy, especially when it comes to diet and exercise, but you did it! As someone who\u2019s on their own tough journey to live a healthier lifestyle, I must say you\u2019re an inspiration. Good luck and keep up the awesome work you\u2019re putting into yourself!", "NTA\n\nMy mother used to be the same until she finally got her head out her butt and realised that her comments made me more depressed, which would make me sneak more junk food, which would make me gain more weight.\n\nIt sounds like your mother is doing the same to you. \n\nAlso, you didn't make a scene - you left calmly and without incident. \n\nSince your mother won't say it, let this internet stranger say that I am VERY VERY VERY proud of you for the 10 pounds and am glad you're enjoying the gym.", "First of all, good for you for finding a \"health\" program that works for you. \n\nSecond, when people are making judgmental comments like your family it is because they are unhappy with their own situation/health/weight/etc. They rely on you to stay in your same role in order to make them feel less bad about themselves. Don't let them.\n\nYou are SO NTA. You owe it to yourself and your journey to protect your heart and your health from so-called \"family\" who don't know the true meaning.", "NTA and if you were near by, I'd invite you to our Christmas, just so you can stay away from that nightmare of a gathering. I'm chunky. I started this year at 5'4 and 263 pounds. As of right now, I am 5'4 and down to 229. I know the pain in the ass process weight loss is. Some people shed it no problem, others it takes some time. But guess what. You, my dear, have still made progress. You have lost 10 pounds. You have found a good, healthy outlet of going to the gym. You know your goals and aspirations. These are all positive things that should be talked about. Your family CHOSE to look at the negatives like I am CHOOSING to look at the positives. There's no point in harping on much else because you understand your health and where it was/is going. The actions to take now would be to find ways to help support those positives (someone could be a walking or gym buddy, recipe sharing, a celebratory outing for a reward for progress made, etc).", "NTA\n\n> It just made me feel bad. \n\nWhich is why it\u2019s right thst you left. There\u2019s no need to stay at the table while your mother engages in what is really just vicious gossip.\n\nI do think a bit of a spine could be helpful - both in putting your mom on an information diet, and being willing to tell her that you want the subject matter dropped. That your body and weight are not up for discussion. If you want to talk about it, you will bring it up. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s okay to let people upset. In this situation your mom was in the wrong.\n\nGood luck to you OP - and keep those goals in sight! This internet stranger is proud of you. (Both for working towards healthier habits, and not sitting around to be your mom\u2019s verbal punching bag)\n\n(Also - healthy at every size to me means no matter what my size is, I CAN engage in healthy habits. I\u2019m worth the care and love to my body. And if the weight is from unhealthy habits, the weight will drop. But it\u2019s a side effect of the goal. It\u2019s a mental perspective that works for me.)", "NTA and when your mom asks why you weren\u2019t around during Christmas just tell her you\u2019d rather spend the holidays with people who don\u2019t make you feel bad about yourself.", "NTA you just left, I think they are projecting because they feel bad themselves. No need to engage with any of that beyond. I left because I was uncomfortable. End of story.\n\nKeep up the good work! It's hard but you have the right attitude! Keep up that momentum, keep chopping down your portion size gradually, it helped for me! Cut out things you feel like you can live without or just eat them less times a week to start.\n\nYou are doing awesome! I wish you all the best!", "Dump your family.  Sorry.  They are horrible people.  Your mother especially.", "This. NTA OP", "I would have rather just been left alone. Constantly being bothered about it made me just want it more and had a negative effect on my resolve. It wouldn't have been so annoying, except that I told several people the reason I was staying away. It was like they didn't believe me or something\n\nThank you for your nice words. But if somebody says to leave them alone, for whatever reason they are saying it, people should just leave them alone. I know now that it came from good intentions, but they weren't helping me at all", "Oh, well, yes!! If someone tells anyone to leave them alone for whatever reason, that would always happen! Thanks for your answer!"]}
