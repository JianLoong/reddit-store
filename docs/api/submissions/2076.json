That sucks for everyone, especially her and especially because she will continue to perceive her father with little stars in her eyes, no matter what he does mostly, until maybe she reaches adulthood and sees him in a truer light. \n\nSo in the meantime, accept that dad is not likely going to change. It sucks. It\u2019s not right. He\u2019s a shit father and your anger is justified. But you are not likely to change that. \n\nPut your energy into supporting daughter manage her expectations, work through her feelings, and model for her setting clear boundaries (no custody changes in sight, I assume?). Get her into therapy and if only for your daughter\u2019s benefit, be kind to dad. I don\u2019t mean let him walk all over you. I mean there\u2019s having a productive conversation about his commitments to his daughter and there\u2019s backhanded comments that daughter may hear and will 100000% see dad as the victim (I can already hear it, *but he did show up. He just had really important things to do\u2026*)\n\nNot being able to change a situation sucks, especially one like this \u2014 seeing her little broken heart so frequently. But you know how dad is. Yelling at him won\u2019t change it. Him seeing his kid\u2019s heart broken hasn\u2019t changed it.

His daughter needs to be in therapy and he should be the one to pay for it.

I was that kid. My biodad was the one that always promised to come take me fishing, camping, do general outdoorsy stuff etc... but was either too late to do the activity, or didn't turn up at all. It hurt... a lot! Fortunately, from when I was around 7, I had a \"step-dad\" like OP who stepped in and picked up the slack. 30 years later, me and my \"step-dad\" are great friends and spend a great deal of time together.

And if you can\u2019t do that then maybe have an honest conversation with her. But it isn\u2019t right for you to make promises and hurt her feelings when you fail to keep them.\u201d\n\n(He\u2019s obviously mistaken if he thinks that the guy that is there every day is \u201cplaying daddy,\u201c and somehow bio is being the dad in any way.)", "Is she in therapy?

I remember more than people realize. Broken promises leave a different kind of emotional damage.", " NTA - just being a good stepdad.", "SO NTA. And OP, i actually believe you did him a favour by telling that. It may be the wake up call he needed to start improving the relation with his daughter.

He is a biological father. Most men can be fathers, as most women can be mothers but to be a Dad or a Mum takes years of dedication, affection and care.", "Just a word of warning, HE might try to make you the bad guy. Comments like \"Oh, I'm sorry I was late but Wild_Giraffe made me feel unwelcome and that made it harder to come.\" Or \"Oh you don't need me there, Wild_Giraffe says he's your real dad.\" These comments won't necessarily change her mind about your relationship but they will make it more likely that you become the lightning rod for her hurt and anger that he causes"]}
