That's normal behaviour.\n\nYou had a long ass week, you wanted to rest. She wanted to take you out of your comfort zone when you were already mentally exhausted. You're not in the wrong for rejected plans she made without telling you. If she knew right off the bat that you'd say no to them, she probably shouldn't have made them in the first place.\n\nNo need to apologize there.", "NTA\n\nI think a lot of neurotypicals would call you TA in this situation, but they need to understand a surprise upset to routine can be deeply uncomfortable for autistic folks. \n\nAnd, honestly, it sounds like they planned this weekend for them, not you. They didn't once stop to consider your actual wants or needs. Your reaction was justified. They need to learn who you actually are and what you actually want.", "NTA \nThey're massive ones though.  Even if they'd planned it innocently and were disappointed you were not thrilled,  you would still be NTA. The fact that they KNEW you would have said no, makes it 50x worse.  What we they hoping for,  here? Did they need an excuse for a weekend away?", "NTA, the key is where they said \"we knew if you asked you would say no.\" They assume they know your wants and needs better than you do. They haven't taken the time to learn how you want to be treated. I hope you can reconcile but they are definitely in the wrong", "NTA. By now, your family should know this aspect of your personality and accept it for what it is: you need time to prepare. Simple as that. Maybe you want your favorite shirt, maybe you don't know if they remembered your toothbrush. Maybe you already had plans that weekend. It doesn't matter, but while your sister's intentions were good, she seemed to have forgotten your needs in the planning. \n\nAnd to be clear, this has nothing at all to do with you being autistic. I'm pretty neurological and I'd want time to.ger mentally ready for a weekend away.", "NTA.  You also mention that if you \"had gotten a weekend off\", which means that you still had work that day.  If so?  You would have been missing work without prior notice to your employer.  Putting your employment at risk over a surprise \"fun day\" when you hate surprise fun is not exactly a considerate act on the part of your mom and sister.\n\nHope you're free of the job.
