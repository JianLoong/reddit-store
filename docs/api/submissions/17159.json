I have both cPTSD and regular PTSD, and triggers are an absolute bear, and I get that it is that much more upsetting for her to feel triggered by something connected to the partner she loves so much.\n\nBUT - and I really want to emphasize this for you - this trigger is NOT YOUR FAULT AND NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. You have not done anything wrong, and it would actually be super unhealthy for you to have kept to that promise you made her, because it was a really inappropriate, unhealthy demand in the first place. She should never have been asking you to make promises about how you would maintain YOUR body in order to protect HER mental health. She took advantage of your vulnerabilities to ask you something that wasn't in either of your best interests . . .  And her accusing you of \"breaking a promise\" and getting angrier and angrier and making you out to be the bad guy here for establishing bodily autonomy is downright worrisome. She is feeling out of control, and trying to establish control over your body in order to feel better, and that's not a healthy coping mechanism. And she's blaming you for her inability to cope. So much no.\n\nShe needs to deal with this with her therapist. And it may not get fixed right away, but it needs to be a priority. She needs to understand that even if it upsets her, she doesn't get to control your body to make her feel safe, ESPECIALLY when it comes to something that makes YOU feel strong and secure in yourself. She doesn't get to tear your security down in order to build hers up. That is not how healthy relationships work. \n\nYou are NTA, and I'm sending you big hugs for both of you. I hope you can figure this out, but you aren't doing anything wrong when you take steps to feel good in your own skin, my friend. You're on the right path. Hang in there.", "NTA.\n\nDo not set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm when they wouldn't do the same for you.\n\nYes I get triggers are assholes (C-PTSD here too) But with some we have to learn how to cope with them and deal with them. This is one of those ones. It sucks and it hurts to learn how to handle them. But guess what? We gotta do it.\n\nShe needs to go back to therapy and needs to accept that you aren't a doll you're a person too. And it's hair. On YOUR body not hers.", "Her saying that towards the beginning of the relationship was a red flag.  A flag that you could have sorted out back then.  \n\nShe does need to conquer this tho.

And she seemed genuinely shocked that I would never not love her over something like that.\n\nI encourage you to listen to your therapist on this, and do not let her trauma dictate your life. I hope she is able to realize that too.\nAnd absolutely NTA", "Long hair is a lot of work. Is she brushing it for you each night? NTA", "NTA A spouse shouldn't control your appearance.

NAH.\n\nOn one hand, it's your body, you can do whatever you want with it, and if short hair brings you happiness, it's reasonable to go for it.\n\nOn the other hand, I can see her point, she literally has triggers over that hairstyle, she asked you to promise not to have that particular hairstyle before committing to you, and now she feels like by breaking this promise you married her on the wrong pretense, which is not necessarily wrong, it was her condition and you promised to satisfy it, and now you are reneging on that promise. \n\nWhat I think does need to happen is that you have to sit down together, you and her, with the therapist as a mediator, and figure out how much of an effort would it be for her to nullify that trigger vs how much this hairstyle brings you happiness, and go from there.", "Is it a particular short hairstyle or any short hairstyle? Is there a store that would be less triggering and still work for you?\n\nI'm leaning toward NAH.
