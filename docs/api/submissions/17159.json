My wife suffers from complex PTSD, as do I although mine is... \"milder\", I guess? We are both in therapy. She is dealing with a lot of past trauma and I am dealing with my complicated childhood and codependency issues. \n\nWhen we met, I had grown my hair out from the very short style I had always kept. She asked me before we married to never cut my hair that short again. Of course, I agreed as I was terrified of her leaving me even though she has always been the most wonderful, understanding person and I absolutely adore her. She has been there for me through so much and I honestly feel I couldn't have chosen a better partner to spend my life with.\n\nCut to a couple months ago, and while sorting through a bunch of stuff in therapy, I said to my ther really wanted to cut my hair short as I just wanted to feel like me again. With my therapist's encouragement I cut it short into a style I love and which everyone says suits me and makes me look good. Everyone, that is, except my wife.\n\nShe didn't talk to me for about a week and basically told me it's triggering for her to even look at me. She's become a lot more comfortable with it but she keeps bringing up how much she misses me with long hair. She is becoming more insistent that I grow it back out and I have told her I don't want to, because for the first time in YEARS I am happy with how I look and I feel good about myself. \n\nShe says I am selfish and has accused me of breaking my promise to her before we married and says it's as bad as if I'd broken my wedding vows to her. She is truly unhappy with it. \n\nMy therapist says sacrificing my own happiness for hers is just giving in to the codependency tendencies I have been working so hard to improve on, but my wife is genuinely upset with it. \n\nI don't want to grow my hair at all, but I also don't want my wife to be unhappy and feel unsafe around me. \n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1683989611, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13gjm88/aita_because_i_refuse_to_grow_my_hair_long_again/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Listen to your therapist.\n\nRefusing to grow out your hair is actually good for your wife. She can learn that just because you don\u2019t agree to every one of her demands, you still love and support her. You\u2019re the same woman you were with longer hair, just happier & more comfortable with your appearance.\n\nGood luck to both of you.", "NTA. Our traumas don\u2019t give us reason to control the behavior and bodies of others. \n\nIt\u2019s her turn to face this head on and realize she can love someone without controlling them.", "NTA and this is sincerely something she should take up with her therapist. I could understand, if you had gotten it done in a style very similar to her personal villian, her asking you to change the style but trying to hold you to hasty promise *never* to wear a shorter hairstyle is pretty extreme and she needs to work out why it matters so much & learn to accept that she can't have final authority over your hair.\n\nIn the meanwhile,  I am happy for you that you feeling more like \"yourself\" and more comfortable with what you see in the mirror. You do not have to set yourself on fire to keep her warm.", "NTA. Lots of people have short hair. How does she deal with the outside world if short hair triggers her? Does she leave the house?", "NTA\n\nI get her upset, I do. I have both cPTSD and regular PTSD, and triggers are an absolute bear, and I get that it is that much more upsetting for her to feel triggered by something connected to the partner she loves so much.\n\nBUT - and I really want to emphasize this for you - this trigger is NOT YOUR FAULT AND NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. You have not done anything wrong, and it would actually be super unhealthy for you to have kept to that promise you made her, because it was a really inappropriate, unhealthy demand in the first place. She should never have been asking you to make promises about how you would maintain YOUR body in order to protect HER mental health. She took advantage of your vulnerabilities to ask you something that wasn't in either of your best interests . . .  And her accusing you of \"breaking a promise\" and getting angrier and angrier and making you out to be the bad guy here for establishing bodily autonomy is downright worrisome. She is feeling out of control, and trying to establish control over your body in order to feel better, and that's not a healthy coping mechanism. And she's blaming you for her inability to cope. So much no.\n\nShe needs to deal with this with her therapist. And it may not get fixed right away, but it needs to be a priority. She needs to understand that even if it upsets her, she doesn't get to control your body to make her feel safe, ESPECIALLY when it comes to something that makes YOU feel strong and secure in yourself. She doesn't get to tear your security down in order to build hers up. That is not how healthy relationships work. \n\nYou are NTA, and I'm sending you big hugs for both of you. I hope you can figure this out, but you aren't doing anything wrong when you take steps to feel good in your own skin, my friend. You're on the right path. Hang in there.", "NTA.\n\nDo not set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm when they wouldn't do the same for you.\n\nYes I get triggers are assholes (C-PTSD here too) But with some we have to learn how to cope with them and deal with them. This is one of those ones. It sucks and it hurts to learn how to handle them. But guess what? We gotta do it.\n\nShe needs to go back to therapy and needs to accept that you aren't a doll you're a person too. And it's hair. On YOUR body not hers.", "Her saying that towards the beginning of the relationship was a red flag.  A flag that you could have sorted out back then.  \n\nShe does need to conquer this tho.  Is she seeing a therapist?", "My wife also has some complicated trauma in her past, which I thought I understood. But I found out YEARS after I commented on liking a certain hairstyle that she thought if she changed it too much, I wouldn\u2019t love her and/or would leave.\n\nI felt horrible when, with the help of her therapist, she said she wanted to do it differently. And she seemed genuinely shocked that I would never not love her over something like that.\n\nI encourage you to listen to your therapist on this, and do not let her trauma dictate your life. I hope she is able to realize that too.\nAnd absolutely NTA", "Long hair is a lot of work. Is she brushing it for you each night? NTA", "NTA A spouse shouldn't control your appearance. Wear the skin that makes you feel good about yourself.", "NTA You continue to do what's best for you. Your wife needs to work this out in therapy. But I wonder if she's in love with you or your long hair?", "NAH You both have quite a heavy load. I wish you and your wife all the best.", "Info needed- why exactly did she not want you to cut your hair short?", "Nta! You need to be comfortable with yourself first and foremost. She doesn't get to dicate how you wear your hair. You broke your vows because you didn't let your wife walk all over you?It sounds like something your wife needs to work on. \nHave you tried couples therapy? Maybe it's something to look into\nEdit  typos.", "Eh... NAH.\n\nOn one hand, it's your body, you can do whatever you want with it, and if short hair brings you happiness, it's reasonable to go for it.\n\nOn the other hand, I can see her point, she literally has triggers over that hairstyle, she asked you to promise not to have that particular hairstyle before committing to you, and now she feels like by breaking this promise you married her on the wrong pretense, which is not necessarily wrong, it was her condition and you promised to satisfy it, and now you are reneging on that promise. \n\nWhat I think does need to happen is that you have to sit down together, you and her, with the therapist as a mediator, and figure out how much of an effort would it be for her to nullify that trigger vs how much this hairstyle brings you happiness, and go from there.", "Is it a particular short hairstyle or any short hairstyle? Is there a store that would be less triggering and still work for you?\n\nI'm leaning toward NAH. You did go back on your word, but it was a promise you shouldn't have made in the first place and it's important for your mental health. But also, it would be fair for her to not be able to live with this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My hair being short is triggering for her.", "Her being triggered by short hair is something she needs to SERIOUSLY talk to her therapist about, work through and not project into her wife. Period. If the trauma is so bad that a HAIRSTYLE is triggering, she needs to work through that. That is not OPs job, even as her wife. What does she do when her family members have short hair ? Cut them off?

They're both women", "I guess there's a difference between changing between various appearances and doing the one thing that your SO can't stand. For me it's short hair. And OP even agreed to that. You will certainly not agree with this but it's also \"a bit of an issue\" if you can't continue a relationship when you partner has sex with someone else. Because that doesn't change anything for you.

You implicitly agree not to cheat because that's the default setting for relationships at the moment. In OP's case she explicitly agreed to not cut her hear short.  It's all about expectations. You cannot say after a few years of a relationship that you changed your mind about being exclusiv and your partner now has to live with it, can you? OP's wife apparently made it a condition for their relationship and OP didn't comply although agreeing first. Of course you can say that this is a ridiculous thing to ask (as is sexual exlusivity in my eyes), but OP agreed to it and that makes her the asshole.", "Because it doesn't align with your arbitrary moral code.
