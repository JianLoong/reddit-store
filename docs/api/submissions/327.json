Either you can be friends with both of them, or one or more of you need to become more mature.", "NTA, but you need to have a conversation with both of them about how you value each friendship, and that friendship with one does not minimize the other.", "YTA\n\nYou can't hide a friendship.  Be honest with Ellie.  You might lose her, but that is her choice to make.\n\nThat being said, back when we were in school and a similar age difference to Ellie and Sally, my big sis looooved to thieve my friends. She definitely did it to hurt me and prove that she was cooler than me, and even my own friends would ditch me to hang out with her, see see see, you suck, little loser sister.\n\nNow we are adults, and as thick as thieves.  But you bet your butt neither of us are still friends with those feckless friends of mine.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The problem comes when you lie about who you're friends with.  If you want to be friends with Sally, proudly and confidently be friends with her. If other people can't handle that, maybe they aren't such great friends to begin with.\n\nDo you really want to spend your time making up lies about who you're with (and then more lies once they figure it out) just so other people don't get jealous?  That sounds exhausting.", "ESH. \n\nYou can be friends with whoever you want, however shouldn't be lying about it.", "ESH and Ellie TA. You should be more honest and not do things in secret but she shouldn\u2019t be insecure about you being friends with her sister"]}
