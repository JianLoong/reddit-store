Your sister IS a spoiled and greedy brat if she's willing to barter your father's present happiness for what she thinks is her due from his estate. Amazing, what the prospect of a juicy inheritance will do to a potential heir's sense of kindness and compassion. You have those traits in abundance. Your sister does not. And you were not a jerk for pointing that out.", "NTA. Holy cow, I would be horrified if my sister said this. Your dad doesn\u2019t owe you guys anything, even in death. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Your sister seems to care very much about the inheritance, and very little about your father's happiness.", "NTA.\n\nThe money belongs to your Dad and ultimately it is his decision to on who or where it goes.", "NTA\n\nYour sister *is* a greedy money grubbing brat.", "NTA. You probably should have said a lot worse to your sister. She obviously cares much more about your father's money than she does his happiness which says a lot about your sister. And in no way can your stepmom be replacing your mom when you're both adults and almost in your fifties. It's not like she's changing diapers and cooking meals for you guys she is there with your dad so they both can be happy in their Twilight years if your dad is smart he'll cut your sister off completely", "NTA\n\nYour sister didn't earn the money, your dad did. She is absolutely selfish - she would rather your dad be alone and depressed than enjoy the remainder of his life, happy, with his new wife. Also, happy people live longer. His health could improve with a loving, nurturing partner, he could live for years. \n\nYou are definitely not the AH your sister is a huge one. I wouldn't be surprised if she let's slip to daddy how she feels - maybe he'll cut her out of the will.", "NTA - if your dad wanted to will HIS entire estate to charity he can - he doesn't owe your sister a cent.", "NTA - inheritance isn\u2019t yours, until it hits your bank account. It\u2019s not being taken from anyone, because it still belongs to Dad. He can spend it all, or give it all to charity, or write anyone out of will. No one is entitled to it. So sis IS being a greedy little brat. \n\nBut it sounds like she\u2019s still grieving mom, so I would recommend trying to give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that at least some of this is coming from feeling conflicted about wanting Dad to be happy and being afraid of showing any disloyalty to Mom. I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your mother, and I hope your Dad ends up needing every penny because he lives another 30 years!", "NTA, \n\nI assume she is similar age to yours. And she literally sounds like a teenager. So she wants your dad to be lonely for 10 years after your moms passing and be depressed and die with more money left behind for her? I would as a mother just write her off my inheritance for treating me like a piggy bank.", "nta - your sister should be happy your dad is happy. your sister sounds sad and toxic.", "NTA\n\nShe is in fact acting like a money grabbing brat, you just spoke the truth", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re in the right, even if the phrasing was probably not well received. \n\nBut I\u2019d give your sister the benefit of the doubt and assume her concern about money is really about grief and her children\u2019s security. She does not make herself look good, though.", "NTA\n\nYour sister desperately needs therapy if she's a 49 year old woman and **still** cannot accept her dad remarrying after mom died.  \n\nHowever, from your post, it sounds much more like sister's only **real** concern is \"less money for me.\"   After all, she was worried about him having bouts of cancer before dying.  Not because he'd suffer but because \"less money for me\"  (i.e. lower inheritance)\n\nHonestly, if I were in your shoes, I'd have called her much worse than a greedy brat.", "NTA\n\nShe is a greedy brat if money in her pocket is more important than your dad's happiness. He doesn't owe her, you, or the grandkids anything. It's really sad that when someone is well off, people think about what's in it for them. Her sense of entitlement is galling.", "NTA\n\n 100% correct that she thinks she's entitled to your father's money", "NAH\n\nYour sister hasn't actually done anything here other than express being annoyed that she is going to be hundreds of thousands of dollars worse off than she thought she was going to be. I don't blame her for being annoyed. Can most people on here honestly say they wouldn't feel the same way?\n\nIt's not like she's going out her way to harm/hurt your dad's new wife.\n\nI don't think you're the AH because you're welcome to your opinion too, but it does depend how mad you got.", "ESH\n\nYour sister has a point if she's worried about both hers and your children. College is EXPENSIVE and every little bit helps. Maybe the way she said it though wasn't the kindest way- your dad deserves happiness too.\n\nYou didn't need to call her names, because it doesn't sound like she just wants money. It's also okay to not be happy with a non family member inheriting family money. \n\nSo sorry for your loss OP.", "NTA you were \ud83d\udcaf correct.", "ESH but your sister clearly sucks more. I just think your response to your sister is unproductive. Calling her a greedy brat is only going to make her defensive and shut down communication. I would have told her that you are concerned that she seems more concerned about finances than your father\u2019s well- being. \n\nI don\u2019t know if your Dad may be able to alter the 50% split through a will but wanting him to consider doing that isn\u2019t simply greedy. Where I come from a lot of older people with significant wealth do prenups or give clear instructions in their will giving their new spouse a clear portion of their estate but the majority to their children and grandchildren. Especially, if the wealth is inter generational. Meaning their is an expectation that wealth is to be passed down the family line. Ie their parents gave them inheritance assuming they\u2019d pass it down to their children and might have created different wills without that expectation", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If my mom wants to leave all her money to a cat shelter, that\u2019s up to her.", "Could have handled it better for sure.First off - the fact that there is no prenup may be irrelevant. Does your father have a will and has it changed since your mom died? If his will states that if your mom predeceases him that his inheritance would pass to his children; then I would doubt that any state rules apply. Seems to me the state laws are in place if there is no will or trust in place; but that probably isn't your situation (hopefully Dad has a will with those assets)  \n\n\nThat said, you are right, it should never be about the inheritance, and only your father's happiness, but money makes people crazy and oftentimes, they spend it before it's theirs, if you know what I mean.  \n\n\nWills can be drawn up in all kinds of ways too, like setting up an A/B trust. When my SIL passed, (she and my brother have one grown son), he remarried within a year and it took us all aback; but after realizing that he needed someone to love and his new wife made him happy, the entire family was ok with it. That's when they both changed their wills and created an A/B Trust. It effectively says; my new SIL gets to stay in the home he owned for as long as she wants, but when she moves or passes; that home belongs entirely to my nephew. It also states that any assets either of them had prior to marriage (like a condo she owned at the time) remain the sole property of the person it belonged to prior to marriage when either of them passes. It's been very good for the family to know that my deceased SIL's wishes to take care their son are carried out in this way.  \nI'd be curios to know if Dad has a will and how it is written.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your sister is trying to get herself written out of getting any inheritance at all.", "NTA.  Your dad can choose to leave all of his money to his wife or to homeless cats if he chooses.  Has she discussed your father\u2019s will with him?  Who knows if his new wife came to the marriage with money of her own.  She sounds more bitter about him moving on and is using her inheritance as an excuse to cause problems.", "NTA. Your sister should be glad your dad was able to find happiness again. But then it's not about her, so why would she?", "NTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t go too far, you had to put your sister on her place. She better shut up at least in front of your dad otherwise she might get nothing after his passing. Which is exactly what she deserves tbh. She is a massive AH because it is not about your mum for her. It is entirely about your dad\u2019s money.", "NTA", "NTA Good for you for standing up for your dad your dad deserves a chance at happiness again.", "NTA i wouldn't want to hear that either. I'm in a similar situation because my dad is in his 70s and has cancer, and I would blow up if my brother bitched about our \"inheritance.\" (My parents are still married to each other and I can't imagine being excited for my mom to die and my dad be a widower so I can get an inheritance. That's disgusting.)", "NTA - Hope the OP's Dad spends every penny enjoying the heck out of life!", "Seems like inheritance is the real worry", "Yes it makes me mad when kids think they are entitled to their parents money! I just want to the parents to spend it all and not leave them with a penny. If your more worried about my money then my happiness you are not getting anything. I will donate it, waste it, or burn it but you ain\u2019t getting it!", "Yeah I probably should have kept it at acting greedy and not called her a brat. I was pretty mad she was so focused on money when our dad was clearly very happy about it", "NTA However it\u2019s not the sisters money. No one is entitled to a inheritance. His dad can set his money on fire and dance naked on the ashes. It\u2019s not op\u2019s money or his sisters money. Hope dad finds out how much of a greedy brat sister is being and just writes her out of the will.", "I get what you're saying but Alecia is family now", "Where we live, without a will the surviving spouse is entitled to 100%. This is what happened with my mom. Nobody objected for obvious reasons. But with a will the spouse is entitled to a minimum 50%. I dont know what his will looks like but for all I know he could be giving most of it to some of the charities he supports", "Seriously, good on your father for bouncing back. And I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "Except that might not be the case for ally. She doesn\u2019t have to feel like Alecia is family. You are adults and she can have a different relationship with your dad than you have. She clearly feels that Alecia is replacing your mom and that is valid for her to feel that. You can\u2019t force that relationship on them", "That would concern me- what assets did your mom have and what would she have wanted for her children and grandchildren? I doubt your mother would want her assets to go to another woman even if she would hopefully be happy her husband found love again (I\u2019ve totally told my husband that I want him to remarry but I would haunt him to his grave if he didn\u2019t make sure my money went to our kids) \n\nGiven that your Mom didn\u2019t have a will I would talk with your Dad about whether he has a will. I would start by saying Dad I want to talk to you about something that feels awkward - but I believe it\u2019s important. Given that Mom didn\u2019t have a will I just want to make sure that you have one. And see what he says. If he asks why, I would say you obviously have the right to will whatever to whoever you want. But I think it would be helpful for us to have a sense of your wishes now. (Pause and he may just tell you- if he asks why say the following) \n\nI\u2019m very happy you\u2019ve found love and have remarried. But without a will your entire estate will go to your new wife. You obviously have the right to give whatever to whoever. But not surprisingly, I hope that you have a will and that it includes your whole family. \n\nSee how he responds -if yes hopefully he will give you a sense of the distribution. If he doesn\u2019t I\u2019d ask and tell him that knowing ahead of time will prevent less stress and drama upon his death which will be hard enough. If no I\u2019d say the following. Legally, of course you have the right to do that. But I would ask that at a minimum Mom\u2019s assets go to us since  I believe that is what she would have wanted. I would also ask that he consider at least giving to his grandchildren. \n\nMy family tends to be really upfront about this stuff- in order to minimize bad feelings and fighting after death", "Yes this", "Well, it\u2019s the dad\u2019s money and he clearly considers Alecia family, so his opinion is the only one that matters. \n\nOP didn\u2019t say anything about forcing a relationship between the two of them, he was addressing her feelings of entitlement towards their dad\u2019s money. Those are two very different things.", "By law, she objectively is family", "Who said that your father was even going to leave you two money?

What a ghoul she is!", "NTA. What a vulture.", "Most people dads age get a prenuptial agreement for this very reason. If dad dies a week after the wedding the new wife deserves to get the money?  I have seen similar situations in the past and they did not go down well.  Does dad deserve to be happy?  Heck yeah.  But should he have been smart and setup a prenup. Also heck yeah.", "NTA. Your dad is entitled to a life of his own. Even if your sister is right and he doesn't live long it's better he's happy than lonely and miserable. \nI would tell your dad to enjoy his money while he can.", "For all she knows stepmother could be a millionaire.", "A friend's mother (86) passed away about 8 months ago.  The parents were pretty well off, and my friend is an only child. Within 4 months of his mom's passing, he told me that his dad was getting married again to a woman, also a widow, who had been friends with both of his parents.  Do you know what my friend and his wife did?  They went to the wedding, and my friend served as his dad's best man!  To my knowledge, there has NEVER been any discussion of how this new marriage will affect any inheritance, and that's as it should be.\n\nOP, your sister **is** a greedy brat, and it's good that you called her out on it.
