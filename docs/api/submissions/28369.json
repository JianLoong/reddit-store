The issue is I have a friend who loves texting and is constantly messaging every second. Many of his friends and family don't mind it and some do.

I think it would do with everyone else, but instead of texting, \"Hey, how are you?\" he decides to text like this: \"H e y h o w a r e y o u ?\" and sends the letters all individually.\r  \n\r  \nWhen he texted the first time, I thought even though I found it annoying, I'd ignore it as he's only done it once, but he continued to send messages like that. After the third time, I asked politely if he could stop sending me messages like that, as it's annoying. He said he would continue to send messages like this on and off. I told him numerous times to stop, and a few times, I've said it's childish, pathetic and stupid to send messages like that, and it's not funny. He has admitted to sending messages like that because he gets a thrill, as he knows it pisses me off.\r  \n\r  \nA year ago, I decided to move from Android to iPhone and finally invested in an excellent iPhone 7 and turned on iMessage. I wonder if effects are the correct terminology, but along with the messages, he would send these effects, mainly one effect: the laser where the laser shows up on a text.\r  \n\r  \nRecently, I had to turn off all messaging notifications like Messenger, Snapshot and WhatsApp because he's constantly sending me messages like this. Not only that, I am a full-time undergraduate student and I need to concentrate on my studies and I have notified him in the past that I am studying and not to message me but he sends the messages like that even with the notifications off.\r  \n\r  \nI finally snapped.

Yeah, about the right age to cut the immature dead weight from your life.  The first time he messaged after admitting he does this intentionally to piss you off should have gotten him blocked.", "NTA.\n\nBlock him from your phone and from your life.", "NTA\n\nThis guy is a menace. Block him. \n\nBut don't turn off texting for everyone. Someone might need to send a \"help me\" message without using audio, texting is very helpful for those emergency cases.", "NTA whatsoever. He can fuck right off", "That would drive me fucking insane.", "NTA.\n\nHe's beyond annoying.  If I were you I would block him completely.", "NTA, that is wild. He sounds like the worst nine year old in the world. I'd have cut him out of my life long ago in your shoes. Certainly, I'd have blocked his number the third time he did it. He must be suffering with ADHD or something. Must be something going on there. Regardless, that's not your problem. Just block his number. If he wants it unblocked, he'll need to cop on.", "Block the immature asshole. Wanna hear something fun? I have a friend... that's around .. idk, 50? Does something similar.. only instead of letters, he does words. Still annoying as fuck, and I've told him as much. He's stopped, mostly.", "NTA, but boundaries are a three-step process.\n\n1. State what you're comfortable with and why. (Why is optional.)\n2. If repeated tell them you'll leave next time.\n3. Third time, leave.", "Lol would have blocked him a long time ago.", "ESH - You could just as easily block him. I mean it doesn't sound like they are much of a friend since they should only message you if its an emergency - is that how it is for everyone or just him? You make it seem like people aren't allowed to reach out and see how you are doing and stuff.\n\nYou are going through so many unnecessary steps when you literally have the power to make it stop.", "NTA Sounds like there\u2019s something wrong with the guy.", "NTA but barely, because it's a bit too easy to mute/spam an individual on a social networking app instead of going off a couple of times. You don't want to block or delete him for whatever reason? You've laid down a boundary, he hasn't listened, at this point I would put him in my spam folder. That way you have to go out of your own way to find his messages and he's none-the wiser because you're still on his friends list. He'll just get sick of sending messages to a wall one day.  \nI understand though, telling someone that something annoys you and they continue, but you have full control over this interaction and going off at him isn't going to help him see your perspective. Especially when your perspective is \"You're a childish idiot.\"  \nLike, that'll create a FAR bigger issue/rift with your families than removing him from social media.", "Forward every message he sends you to his father. Tell him you'll keep doing that. Keep doing that.", "NTA, but there's no point in sending him sending him that message.  He **likes** that he's upsetting you.  He admitted it.\n\nHe's not your friend.\n\nJust block him.", "NTA  \n\n\nJust block him. You commented on your post about your families having known each other for 30 years. That shouldn't matter. Either way, if they have a problem, then you can address them at that time. He's even admitted to doing it to get a rise out of you, so he can't play the victim card or anything.", "NTA. Your 'once a day' thing seems a bit extreme but he's just an asshole. He knows what he is doing and keeps doing it because he's an ass.", "ofc your NTA.  \nbro has an addiction to texting, TLC needs him", "NTA. Block or mute him.", "Wow he is\u2026.immature to say the least. You can mute only his texts, I do this for a couple of people who always text inane things. They still come through but silently and no notifications unless I\u2019m in the actual message app.", "NTA. If you can't block him, then mute him and--this is key--NEVER respond to him again. Don't read his texts and don't respond to him.", "OK, so... ESH.\n\nObviously, his antagonistic needy behavior IS obnoxious. So he sucks for just being \"that guy\". There isn't a doubt in my mind about that. \n\nHowever, you can only control yourself. You can't tell people what to do and what not to do in these kinds of situations and then feel offended when they don't comply. I don't care about the last line of your text, but the rest of it and most of your post just feels like you're more annoyed because someone isn't doesn't feel obliged to obey you. You're just going to exhaust yourself thinking like that. \n\nYou state you hate texting anyway, so why don't you have DND turned on while you're studying, something many people choose to do for this reason? Why don't you block or just mute that guy? Why are you even friends? It doesn't even sound like you like him. The world doesn't revolve around your study schedule - you can't expect people to always know when your head is down. Just because a person texts you doesn't automatically mean you have to respond right there on the spot - that's the beauty of a text. Feeling obligated to respond to a text the moment it comes in is a \"You\" problem, not the problem of the sender.\n\nYeah, his behavior is obnoxious and sucky.
