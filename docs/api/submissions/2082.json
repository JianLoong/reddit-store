My eldest daughter Kay (3) came down very sick this past weekend with what we thought was the flu. But it turns out if was RSV. We know this because my youngest daughter, Elly (14 months), has fallen sick as well. So we take her to her primary care doctor to swab for covid, RSV, etc. \n\nBackground info, her primary care doctor is amazing. Me and my wife both trust her and have never had any complaints and we always do what she says. Now my wife has been very stressed out about our youngest being sick and wanted to make a plan for if we needed to take her to the ER. We never actually did make a plan besides listening to her doctor and essentially expecting to take her to the ER at some point. \n\nDay 2 of Elly\u2019s sickness comes around and the doctor calls to tell us that she had RSV.  We set another appointment on day 4 to bring her to check her vitals. After 10 minutes of examining her Elly\u2019s doctor says her oxygen is low, she\u2019s congested and having a hard time breathing. Basically that it\u2019s not good. Doctor said that I need to go to the ER immediately and to not stop anywhere, not even home for any reason and that she needs to be seen ASAP (she had mentioned that I may need to pick up Elly\u2019s prescription). Another doctor at the office came in to give me a second opinion and she said the same thing.\n\nI call my wife and explain the situation that basically I cannot waste time and that I need to take Elly to the hospital now. She was crying and was extremely sad that she won\u2019t be here for our daughter which is totally understandable and to which I said look her doctor said to bring her immediately so I am because I take my daughters health very seriously. She tried to get me to drive home to pick her up so we can take her to a hospital that\u2019s closer to our house but I wanted to go where the doctor said to go because she called the ER beforehand to make sure we can be seen asap. I love this because waiting for 10 hours in the ER with a very sick baby isn\u2019t good for Elly or my family. But also every childrens hospital in my area has very little space for new patients (due to RSV and covid) so I\u2019ll take what I can get.\n\nNow my lovely wife of 5 years is texting me nonstop calling my a liar and an asshole for not picking her up so we can both take her to the hospital. If I was to take the trip home, then back to the hospital that the doctor recommended, it would take over an hour on a normal day let alone rush hour on a Friday night. I see this time wasted as time that my baby can be in the hospital getting the help she needs. I hate that my wife isn\u2019t here with me, but I feel like I did the right thing. Reddit AITA??\n\n\nEdit: \nThere\u2019s seems to be confusion on why my wife hasn\u2019t joined us at the hospital. We don\u2019t have a second car or second car seat. We are also millennial parents with Boomer grandparents who never see their grandbabies so we don\u2019t have a great support system for our family.
