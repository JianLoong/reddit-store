Sadly my mom is the worst with my dad coming in second (only because he refuses to see how bad it really is).

So I definitely would do the same thing as you and I\u2019m actually considered obese (my weight is caused by medical conditions and the meds I have to take for them).

If you're supporting someone through an eating disorder recovery, retaliating against shitty comments about your wife's disorder by *making shitty retorts about someone's weight* is not a good way to do that.\n\nWas SIL being an AH? Absolutely. Was a \"fuck off, leave my wife alone\" warranted? Absolutely.\n\nBut your wife has an eating disorder - a disorder typically triggered by food, diet, and **weight** talk/comments/insults - and trying to shut down insults aimed at her and comments about her weight by throwing weight talk onto someone else doesn't help. Maybe your wife felt supported, it's not clear here what her reaction to any of this was, but generally speaking, this 100% makes it sound like you are someone who has just as much weight bias as the rest of the family, but that you keep it under wraps for her and could weaponize it against her if she gained \"too much\" weight. Even if that's not something YOU think or would do, this is how it can feel to someone with an ED.\n\nIt doesn't matter that the kid wasn't there. Your retaliation was weight-based, and still has the potential to trigger your wife's disorder. It would have been pretty awful if he was there, but it doesn't make it a healthy or good way to shield her from attacks from family just because he wasn't.\n\nI think you need to check in with your wife about how she is doing after this and how she would like you to handle these situations in the future if someone is making rude comments about her body or disorder. Something that is very hard to embrace when supporting someone in ED recovery is that handling these shitty situations isn't about you or your emotional response - it's about what actually feels safe and supportive to the person in recovery. Sometimes that's just cutting off the conversation or trying to change the subject, sometimes that's telling people to fuck all the way off, and sometimes it's sitting there and holding their hand and then helping them process after.

She needs kept away.", "NTA\n\nLiterally the worst things you can say to someone with an eating order.", "NTA I\u2019m glad that you defended your wife, it sounds like she needs someone in her corner.", "NTA. You are so wonderful how you support your wife. I am so happy she has such a great support system with you. Your SIL is an a very insensitive person.", "For sticking up for your wife - NTA, it's good she can count on your support amongst your family. Sure you could have been more delicate about it but ultimately SIL deserved what she got", "NTA. \n\nFirst, how about none of us ever comment on anyone's body, ever. I am a big person, I tell people they look great, other than that, I don't comment on being thin or big, just like I don't want people to comment on my body. \n\nSecond, they know your wife is being treated, and still feel fine making an entire meal about her body. You cannot allow these people around your wife again, end of story. They really set back her progress. \n\nThird, you aren't treating your wife like a child, you are treating your wife like someone who got a diagnosis and is doing the work she is supposed to do to get better. \n\nFinally, your SIL and wife's sister shouldn't be around your wife, at all. I would also give a huge side eye to anyone who sat at the table and let it happen, and hasn't reached out actively to agree with your comments. I can't imagine ever telling a person to gain weight or do X when I KNOW they have been diagnosed and are working through it. It was intentionally cruel and to make her feel like shit, and you need to really process that. They are purposefully trying to humiliate your wife, and so you can't let them around her again.", "NTA. At all. \n\nAs someone who currently struggles a lot with ED, I just want to thank you. You seem like an amazing partner. \n\nReading how SIL stated it probably wasn't really an ED and just about your wife being picky broke my heart. I'm currently in treatment for anorexia, and can tell you that once you've acknowledged your ED, having another one person state you're not actually sick and just being dramatic or childish is one of the biggest nightmares and fears you carry when struggling with it, we discussed this a lot in group therapy and all of us was so afraid of being told this or discovering how we in fact just are dramatic and not deserving help because it isn't \"serious-\" or \"bad enough\".\n\nI feel so sorry your wife had to endure this horrible behaviour. It can be really traumatising and cause huge setbacks in recovery. \nI wish both you and your wife the best of luck <333", "NTA. Definitely fucked up to call the kid obese but I get why you did.", "I'm gonna join the folks getting downvoted and say ESH. Obviously everyone who participated in bullying your wife for her disordered eating sucks, and you were right to tell them off and ban SIL from your home. Their behavior was completely unacceptable and they're the biggest problems in this situation, bar none.\n\nBut diverting the attention to your nephew's weight was inappropriate and mean-spirited. I'm alarmed that so many people in these comments are giving you a pass for that just because he wasn't present, as if poking at a child's weight is okay so long as you do it behind their back. You should not be making comments about anyone else's weight for any reason, and especially not in front of your wife with an ED.\n\nI hope your wife is doing alright in the wake of all this. It's a shitty situation she didn't deserve to be in the middle of. Thank you for defending her, even if imperfectly. Best wishes to you both.", "They shouldn\u2019t be throwing stones.

If you\u2019re gonna relentlessly comment about someone\u2019s weight, then you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when shit turns awry. Especially when an eating disorder is involved.

They should\u2019ve dropped it after the doctor comment, but they fucked around and found out.", "NTA but next time leave innocent family members out of it.

SIL was absolutely out of line, you were absolutely right to shut her down, but you said \"you need to do something about the fact that your son is so fat\" in front of your wife, who has an ED. She does not need to hear \"losing weight is healthy\" from you. She needs zero weight talk or talk about who's eating what at meals, from anyone. Figure out how to make that happen.", "NTA. You kept your wife safe and you were right, that is what they should be worried about. Your wife has a mental illness that manifests physically and kills a high percentage of those who suffer from it. You are doing right by her and they are trying to sabotage it.", "Turning a bull's behavior back on them is how you stop a bully.  Good on ya.

You owe the apology here.", "ESH but you part only very mildly. \n\nThis is almost entirely on your family for allowing them to bully your wife and you did good to stick up for her. I don't think you realize that your comments about someone else's weight problem can easily bounce right back into your wife's ears and have an effect on her as well, though. \"Mind your own goddamn plate and keep my wife's name out of your mouth\" would have been more than acceptable. Ultimately, if you want someone not to comment on other people's eating habits, doing it back just won't be a super effective deterrent and may actually harm the person you are trying to help.", ">most probably she is just too picky and there's no eating disorder at all.\n\nThis is what got me fuming.

It was purely self inflicted.\n\nNTA", "Your wife is taking care of herself by working with a doctor and your assistance is part of the treatment plan.", "Agreed. Only if the kid was present, would OP be the AH. \n\nProud of you for standing up for your wife, OP!\n\nNTA", "It's also not like OP resorted to the low blow first.  He only did it after more polite efforts totally failed.  His brother needs to have a serious sit-down with his wife before he loses his brother completely.", "OP is NTA. Still, he shouldn\u2019t have retaliated by insulting the son. When someone treats you poorly, it doesn\u2019t justify treating them poorly.

Way too much praise for sticking up for wife when it's not clear that she felt good about this reaction and absolutely could have been very triggered over it. I made a longer main comment about it, but I had a longterm partner in ED recovery, and if I did this shit? They would have likely relapsed on the spot and never trusted me again around support with their ED.", "Please read this one if you check back here, u/Alihaaan101.

Otherwise you'd be in firm E S H territory.", "This is why it is a really bad (if understandable) tactic to attack back. It gives people the out to ignore their own horrible behavior and just focus on how you wronged them. It is far better to calmly and very directly call out their behaviour.

Maybe after this , they'll give some attention towards his health .", "No, he \"told them, her doctor will take care of that and they don't need to bother\"\n\nThere is a difference between saying \"don't bother\" and \"Stop\". If you don't say it directly it is easier for people to ignore.\n\nThere are three phases to the conflict:\n\n1. Give them a hint, allowing them to correct their behavior while saving face. The OP did this when he said the doctors would take care of it.\n2. Direct confrontation. The OP chose to confront the SIL by focusing on her obese child.\n3. End communication. The OP left the dinner.\n\nMy point is that in phase 2 the OP took a weaker position by focusing on the SIL's kid, rather than on the problematic behavior directly. It is a weaker position because it makes it easier for the SIL to change the subject. It is also a less productive position because it makes phase 3 practically inevitable.\n\nIf your words aren't going to make the situation better, why say anything at all?

I just meant that in this case, they were commenting on his issues, he told them to stop, they didn't, so he started commenting on their issues back, which wasn't really necessary. If they don't back down that doesn't mean you should stoop lower.", ">One time should be sufficient.\n\nI agree. It *should* be sufficient. The SIL *did* overstep. The OP was in no way wrong for acting as they did.\n\nBut the OP also chose to say it a second time regardless. They made the decision to keep engaging rather than leaving. In doing so the way they did they only made the situation worse for themself.\n\nUnderstand, I am not saying \"Oh, you should be nicer\". I am just saying that what the OP said didn't actually help *the OP*."]}
