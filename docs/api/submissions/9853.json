So I definitely would do the same thing as you and I\u2019m actually considered obese (my weight is caused by medical conditions and the meds I have to take for them).

If you're supporting someone through an eating disorder recovery, retaliating against shitty comments about your wife's disorder by *making shitty retorts about someone's weight* is not a good way to do that.\n\nWas SIL being an AH? Absolutely. Was a \"fuck off, leave my wife alone\" warranted? Absolutely.\n\nBut your wife has an eating disorder - a disorder typically triggered by food, diet, and **weight** talk/comments/insults - and trying to shut down insults aimed at her and comments about her weight by throwing weight talk onto someone else doesn't help. Maybe your wife felt supported, it's not clear here what her reaction to any of this was, but generally speaking, this 100% makes it sound like you are someone who has just as much weight bias as the rest of the family, but that you keep it under wraps for her and could weaponize it against her if she gained \"too much\" weight. Even if that's not something YOU think or would do, this is how it can feel to someone with an ED.\n\nIt doesn't matter that the kid wasn't there. Your retaliation was weight-based, and still has the potential to trigger your wife's disorder. It would have been pretty awful if he was there, but it doesn't make it a healthy or good way to shield her from attacks from family just because he wasn't.\n\nI think you need to check in with your wife about how she is doing after this and how she would like you to handle these situations in the future if someone is making rude comments about her body or disorder. Something that is very hard to embrace when supporting someone in ED recovery is that handling these shitty situations isn't about you or your emotional response - it's about what actually feels safe and supportive to the person in recovery. Sometimes that's just cutting off the conversation or trying to change the subject, sometimes that's telling people to fuck all the way off, and sometimes it's sitting there and holding their hand and then helping them process after.

OP dig good overall, but this specific part of it wasn't great.", "I loved that show. And when it was on, I was at pretty intense white food. It was basically white food, salmon (that's peach), and a selection of fruits and veggies that i liked. (ignoring my positions at the time on food temperature, texture and viscosity.)", "I have a friend whose daughter had to be sent to an inpatient treatment home for eating disorders and it was connected to PANDAS!  She wasn\u2019t body dysmorphic.  She wasn\u2019t trying to be thinner or fit a body image.  It was looking almost like OCD.  I think there are so many presentations for PANDAS that people don\u2019t realize!", "True, not great, but not bad enough for ESH in my opinion.", "I stream the repeats all the time!  Numb3rs is terrific!", "Salmon is my biggest no!  Haha!  \n\nIt was a great show!", "NTA. You sound like a wonderful, supportive partner. Keep it up!", "Bringing a child into it is wrong but if your wife has trouble eating why would you order multiple dishes so she can take her pick? She knows what these dishes are so how can she not order something she knows she can eat?\n\nIm not being insensitive or rude i just dont understand the lodgic behind it.\n\nI read a menu know what i like and dislike, i wouldnt order multiple dishes just incase i change my mind by the time its served.\n\nHave i misunderstood?", "NTA at ALL. You protected your wife. She's lucky to have you in a world of people like SIL and BIL.", "NTA\nSIL is incredibly rude. I think she pushed you into making a rude comment in response to her. You're right to go NC on her as she will never stop with her BS. Good luck", "NTA I'd be right there with you. Who else will defend your wife when she's not able? All she needed to do was shut the hell up. Just don't mention it. But noooo, she's got to get started on your wife just to be mean. Good on you, OP. Give her a taste of what it's like.\n\nYou're a good husband. Sending caring thought to you and your wife and hopes that she overcomes this soon.", "Nta. What they are doing isn't helping your wife.

She forget about the \"find out\" part.", "NTA, skinny shaming is terrible, and is so socially acceptable. I'm so sorry that she is dealing with that. You're a great partner for putting your foot down and drawing a line. Stand your ground. Your brother and his wife need to learn that people in glass houses shouldn't be playing with machine guns.", "NTA\n\nYou were right in saying what you said, maybe she will save her snide comments next time you see her. These self-absorbed busybodies need to get their own house in order before they start trying to give other people \"advise\".", "NTA , my mom is going through menopause , she has PCOS and at that she had diabetes, this ties up to her gaining weight, ppl always tell her how she should lose weight and what diet she needs to do , and it\u2019s always from ppl who ain\u2019t dietitians or doctors trying to put their input in and being passive and ignorant", "NTA - Normally I\u2019d say ESH because while you are absolutely a hero for defending your wife, you didn\u2019t need to criticize a random kid.

Kids getting disordered eating habits from somewhere & if that child is too heavy, I think we can safely blame the child\u2019s mom considering her total lack of sympathy for disordered eating victims.", "ESH. As someone with an ED, and been in similar situations.  They were assholes for the comments.  You tried to diffuse but should have helped your spouse away sooner ( because as soon as the comments started the meal was already going to be hard).  It was a dick move to throw the kid under the bus.\nSide note: I hope the advice from their doctor is helping with the ED.  EDs are a long journey to recovery and you may always have some lingering struggles.  Identifying the triggers and figuring out how to deal with them in a non ED way is like trying to be fluent in another language at times.  Keep up the support!", "NTA reading this made me LIVID!! My oldest kid has ARFID and every time someone makes a comment about their body weight I want to scream!", "Was the comment about her son needed? Nope, but I get that the last straw had settled on the camel's back. You snapped, I would have too.\n\nWas backing up your wife needed? 100%, and that's the important part. Good on you.\n\nNTA", "The comment about the kid was a bit overboard, but other than that, I'd say NTA. You said what you had to say, and it's better than saying nothing at all.", "NTA - they are bullies in glass houses.", "All I needed was the title. ETA here.", "Early childhood teacher, here.  NTA. An eating disorder is a mental illness.   Nobody says, ooh, pick me to starve to death or force vomiting.   No one.  As a society,  we are literally installing food issues in our kids.  On average,  it takes a kid 17 tries to know if they like a food.  And in 3-6 months,  that might change.   Chill out.  Offer food and stop being invested.   They will not starve and we would just relieve so much stress that contributes to eating disorders.   Twinkies are not the answer.   \n\nAlso,  I have raised 5 kids, all but one is an adult.   I have allowed them all to regulate their food consumption.   Little man will not eat a potato that hasn't been deep fried.   Each of them is a healthy weight.   They're not really wound up in food..  this is from a woman raised in the clean plate club and regularly fat shamed.  This is a thing adults are doing to kids.", "NTA\u2026their conduct was outrageous and u are right not to put yourselves I. Their company in the future.

Thank you for protecting your wife.", "NTA every husband should be like this. Comments about a person\u2019s body that aren\u2019t from a medical professional can very easily set a person\u2019s recovery back. \u201cJust eat.\u201d Is like telling someone with cancer to just be healthy.

Saying nasty things about someone is still nasty, even when they're not there. It was revenge at that point, not just shutting down her toxic comments. That part of it was totally unnecessary and everyone acting like it was noble for him to go there needs to think a bit about what it's like to know that people are horrible about you behind your back.", "they sound like the type of family that won\u2019t let you leave if you don\u2019t clean your plate. explains why they feel so hurt by their son being brought up. he\u2019s the result of their over interest in other peoples eating habits", "The point is, wife is NOT fat, wife is actively trying to get her weight UP to healthy, and people struggling to get their weight up to healthy while living with ED generally perceive themselves as fat when they aren't-- so husband talking about how bad fat is can trigger an ED relapse.", "As someone who has that kind of eating disorder.... Yup", "So it\u2019s cool to talk about thin people? Everyone should stfu about other peoples bodies.

Biggest symptom that he showed, but when it came to food, he was an extremely picky kid and only ate maybe once a day.

Yes, she deserved to be shot down for her remarks. Yes, your brother should've been the one to step in, but didn't.

No. But even that i dont feel bad about as kiddo wasnt there and maybe it knocks some sense into SIL to reflect on her viewpoints", "NTA", "ESH, you weren't wrong to push back but you are absolutely an asshole for making fun of an actual child!", "Isn't it funny that bullies can dish it out but they can't take it?\n\nNTA.", "NTA because the child wasn\u2019t there.

People who live in glass houses, shouldn\u2019t throw stones. She started it. U finished it.", "Ehhh. If you were telling them to stop and they continued and you thought it was the only thing to get them to shut up in the heat of the moment, I can understand why you did so, but it's not exactly great to bring a kid into an adult conversation. Leaning towards NTA. Especially if they were trying to say she was just 'too picky and there's no eating disorder at all'", "Has your wife's sister always treated her badly? This seems like some long-term resentment and hatred that SIL has joined in on. You are NTA and you are supporting your wife, not treating her like a child. If she had MS and needed you to change her diaper, you would do it in a heartbeat. Would that mean you were infantalizing her? I think not. Wish your wife the best. I have been fat most of my life, yet I still recognize your wife's struggles and I would never make fun of her.

I have an eating disorder. And people always comment on what I eat, yesterday I had a snack size bag of Doritos for lunch. But I ate something!!!! Which is better than nothing, which is how my days normally go. It makes me uncomfortable to talk about it, so I make people uncomfortable when they ask about my eating. My therapist recommended the Same as your wife's, eat what you like. It makes it so much easier to get excited about food when you know it's something you like. Another thing shes said is to go back to childhood favorite foods. My fiance keeps my accountable for eating all the time! If he doesn't I will go days without eating...I would've told your SIL the same thing honestly... Granted ive told people when they ask me how I'm so skinny \"usually I starve myself for days at a time because I hate eating and gaining weight. It clearly worked but now I deal with my body eating itself constantly because i no longer ever have hunger ques.

It just made my anxiety worse and I didn\u2019t want to attend functions with food present and was uncomfortable eating around people I wasn\u2019t really close with for a long time. My pediatrician advised to them to let me be picky and don\u2019t force me to eat as I was at a healthy weight and my anxiety would lesson over time. Guess what, when people left me alone I got better. Now in my 30\u2019s after having an actual anxiety diagnosis and treating it my disordered eating is gone.

She was so happy when I started eating green foods other than raw broccoli"]}
