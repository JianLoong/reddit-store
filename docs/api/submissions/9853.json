And good on you for sticking up for your wife, you are a great husband and PARTNER. They could take some lessons from y'all! \n\nGranted, mentioning their child was a bit out of line, however since the kid wasn't there AND  ESPECIALLY because they wouldn't cease when you requested, then I totally get why you went there. In my opinion they don't really deserve an apology, I would just say something such as;  \"Oh, you didn't like that? Well, NOW do you get why it is none of your business, intrusive and RUDE?

The pair of them should leave well enough alone. Your brother should have reined his wife in long before you had to say anything and given that e everyone is aware of her condition SIL should have been shut up at the first instance as well. Plain nasty of the pair of them.", "NTA. Was the comment about her kids weight necessary? Not really but she Made so many low blow comments towards your wife so you made a low blow comment towards her kid. The kid wasn\u2019t there so it doesn\u2019t make it as bad, but the fact people are saying YTA or ESA is kind of interesting considering she started it and when you just reciprocated the same energy she was giving your wife that makes you also in the wrong? You stooped to her level as you should. Being the bigger person doesn\u2019t mean being a pushover. Also who shames someone with and ED for having an ED? That\u2019s the lowest of lows. Cut her off immediately and never let her around your wife or any children if you have the power to do that.", "NTA your wife is going through treatment for an eating disorder.

The comment about the kid was poor judgement, but I have a feeling you only said it to make her stop harping on your wife in the heat of the moment.

Also, is the kid actually obese? There's nothing wrong with telling her a fact. It coming out in this situation doesn't actually make you automatically wrong.

And here's the thing... imagine how she badgers her own child. If he's obese, she's either a \"clean your plate mom\" or she monitors everything he eats so he's sneaking food. She seems to be the one with food issues. \n\nYou told them to stop, that the doctor is handling this. They continued.

And you were right. SIL needs to sort out her own issues and stop bullying your wife. That is exactly what she was doing.  I don't think it was wrong to bring up their obese kid. He is your nephew after all. If they can come for your wife, you can go for their kid. Kid wasn't there to hear it. So that's fine. You defended your wife. Good on you!\n\nYour brother will get over it. He is just angry because his wife is probably in his ear all the time telling him to do something. She seems like the nagging type. She clearly doesn't know when to stop.", "NTA.\n\nStuff like this makes me so irrationally upset. I do something similar for my girlfriend. She has ARFID, and she only has a handful of safe foods. It's very anxiety-inducing for her to go out to eat because she knows that she might not like things, and she thinks that she might bother the kitchen/wait staff for asking for meal adjustments.\n\nYour brother and SILs are being total assholes. I would've absolutely raised hell in front of them.", "NTA. Your SIL is a massive asshole. You were simply stating the obvious. The pot is calling the kettle black.

SiL is a bully and it\u2019s none of her damn business! She can dish it out but can\u2019t take it. You were absolutely right to stand up for your wife! She should not be forced to be around problem who bully and disrespect her!! Do not allow SiL in your home and no more making plans with them.", "NTA as the kid wasn't present- SIL just got a taste of her own medicine.", "meh. you didn't have to bring the kid into it but there's nothing wrong with telling the SIL to mind her own business.", "NTA\n\nYou stood up for your wife as you should have. Eating disorders are horrible things to deal with and a person should never be shamed for trying to get better. \n\nIt sounds like these women are jealous of your wife and feel the need to belittle her to make themselves feel better. \n\nAs far as your comment about the kid, some may think it was out of line but you weren't wrong.", "ESH. they shouldn't be saying those things and you're right to tell them to butt out, but bringing a child into it is uncalled for even when that child isn't there. I'd be worried they'll turn around and tell the child you said that about him. I think children should just be left out of it, everything else would have been solid n t a.", "INFO : was the kid there ? Did he heard what you say ?\n\nEDIT : NTA.", "ESH\n\nThey should keep out of your wife's issues, without a doubt. But you shouldn't have brought their kid into it. Maybe he too has some kind of disorder/condition that affects his weight that you don't know about?", "Yeah, sorry, ESH. \n\nI know why you did it, but I can't justify your comments about your nephew. You probably had a good point, but it was not the right way to phrase it.\n\nYour sister in law is a much bigger asshole for the obvious reasons, and you're completely in the right to cut her out of your life as much as possible.", "ESH. Good for you for standing up for your wife, totally fine to ban these assholes from your house. Leave the kid out of it, though, that was messed up", "ESH\n\nMild Y T A for you, but hopefully calling out your nephew's weight drives home the point that people don't appreciate others talking about their bodies like they were.\n\nYou know why SIL  and Wife's sister are AH.", "ESH\n\nObviously they were horrible. But you could have told them to F\\*\\* off without making this about her kid who has nothing to do with it.", "ESH.\n\nThey were wrong to comment as they did, and you were wrong to retaliate by bringing their son into it.\n\nYour brother needs to see that BOTH comments were wrong and EVERYONE should apologize.", "ESH (them more than you).\n\nYou should not have aimed your ire at their son. So I do believe you owe your brother an apology for saying what you did about his son. However, I would still stand by your decision about the SIL.\n\nSIL is completely out of line about the things she\u2019s saying to your wife. It\u2019s truthfully none of her business.

She should mind her own business, you should have been able to stand up for your wife without bringing a child into the argument.", "ESH. Because the kid has nothing to do with it. But you should keep your boundaries and not see your brother and SIL anymore.", "YTA specifically for bringing the kid into it... just like it's none of your SIL's business how or what your wife eats, it's none of yours to remark on their son or their parenting of him. But, I realize that was a small portion of the entire exchange and generally you seem like you're doing a Grade A good job of supporting and protecting your wife. \n\nYou should apologize for mentioning their child or their parenting, but HOLD the rule about not going out with the SIL present. She seems like a harmful, awful, toxic, and unpleasant person to be around, especially for your wife. I advise you take responsibility for the misstep that involved the kid but otherwise your stance here is reasonable.", "NTA and good thing the obese kid wasn't there or everyone else would have gone home hungry", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sadly my mom is the worst with my dad coming in second (only because he refuses to see how bad it really is). So I feel like I\u2019m the only one really fighting to get her in a healthy relationship with food. So I definitely would do the same thing as you and I\u2019m actually considered obese (my weight is caused by medical conditions and the meds I have to take for them). The main reason though that I asked if sister is a trigger for your wife is because of how my mom triggered/triggers my sister ED.
