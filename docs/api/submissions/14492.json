You are not wrong about the culture though. SOME of them can be brutal towards people who are even a little portly. Most Japanese folks will keep their mouth shut though as they tend to be very considerate.\n3. Your weight loss expectations are going to be difficult for you, let alone her. Initial weight loss is always a lot, that last 40 lbs is going to be a pain. More than dieting will be needed.\n\nI would do everything I could to learn the culture, and encourage her to do so as well. I suggest for both of you the YouTube channel \"Abroad in Japan\" and start at the beginning. Chris Broad, the guy who runs it, started as a portly ESL teacher from the UK and in a few videos he talks about the comments towards his weight, which were mostly from his friends and at school from his students. They do that because they are comfortable with him though. Strangers aren't coming up to him and calling him fat. The videos might encourage her to join your diet, it might not. Either way, you deal with it and bring her.\n\nDO NOT let this opportunity pass you by. And DO NOT let this opportunity pass her by. Even with the culture slightly against you both in some ways, it still will be a great adventure that you will be happy that you shared with your spouse.

Its human nature", "Now you know YTA, at most you can encourage her by starting a more \"Japanese\" lifestyle but you can't demand she get slim to go with you. If she is fine with not being \"accepted within what their society desires\" so be it.  \n\nI think she should decline your ultimatum, let you go to Japan solo then plan a solo Japan trip for herself.", "YTA.
