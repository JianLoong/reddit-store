People have differences between how children should sleep, I am not interested in hearing how we should put my children to sleep as we\u2019re doing what works for kids and all of us. We co-sleep with 3 children. So my 4 year old wakes up a lot and is usually with his dad through the night as he likes to hug and sleep with him and my husband is ok with that. They both enjoy their nights with each other. My 4yo son was like this from birth, he felt more secure sleeping by me or my husband. I usually sleep with my youngest baby, who is 5 months old. She gets woken up by the slightest noise, if my other kid make snoring sound, she wakes up and its hard to put her back to sleep. My middle child is the sleep through the night, for most nights. So basically, I find nights really hard without my husband\u2026 \n\nMy husband decided to go on a religious pilgrimage to Mecca with his friend who has cancer and is not well and he wanted my husband to accompany him so he is not alone and in case his health takes a toll. They have gone to a religious pilgrimage before too, so its not like they haven\u2019t been there. I understand his friend needs him as he might need support. \n\nI am just mad at him for leaving me for 10 days with sleepless night. I don\u2019t know how to deal with this, I am not sure if I have the right to be or stay mad at him.\n\nMy 4yo wanders around in the house at 2am and is constantly up and uncomfortable as he is used to his dad. And when he does that, my 5 months old is up. I only get few minutes of sleep. I want to cry so much cos I am so tired. My husband rang today and I didn\u2019t wanna congratulate him on his completion on his pilgrimage. AITA for being mad at him? Or should I put my being mad aside and be happy for him.

Maybe ESH?\n\nBut I feel like your current system doesn't \"work for kids and all of us\" if neither parent can be away overnight.\n\nI'm not saying I have a solution or know better, but I am questioning if you can truly say this \"works\". Its more like it meets the minimum threshold for tolerable while also chaining you and your husband to the house.", "YTA. You say your arrangement works for you when clearly it doesn't. It isn't sustainable. Your husband's friend needed him at this time and you are exhausted because of an arrangement that you as a couple have enabled. You need to put proper sleeping arrangements into use, with the help of a professional. You cannot be mad at your husband for something that is the product of your own doing.", "YTA. There are plenty of single mothers/fathers that make it work for YEARS, much less 10 days. \nThis is called life, things happen and people need to take trips. I don\u2019t know why you thought you would be entitled to 100% of your husbands life. \nHorrible sleeping habits aside, it\u2019s very selfish of you to demand your husband be home instead of him being with a friend WHK HAS CANCER. \nYou say you understand, but you clearly don\u2019t. You absolutely don\u2019t have the right to stay mad at him.", "Esh for not putting a system in place that could even potentially succeed here. You both 100% knew this would fail and went forward anyway. I sympathize on the utter fatigue, but both of y'all saw this coming", "On balance, YTA\n\nOne (and my initial) view would be that the system you have is poor and needs changing. In which case since the two of you developed the system, it would be your joint problem, and everyone would suck here. But you have dismissed this view from the very start.\n\nSo with the constraint that we must keep your system, then either:\n\na) Neither of you can ever leave overnight ever for any reason, or\n\nb) When one of you leaves, the other will just have to put up with the chaos\n\nOption (a) seems unreasonable and you would probably be TA for effectively demanding that your husband never goes away for any reason for years. It would be equally bad if he demanded the same thing in reverse. Given your husband had gone away, he's clearly not thinking that option (a) is in play.\n\nSo (b) is a lot more workable as it allows you both a chance to lead a life that is not limited by this requirement to be back home every single night.\n\nIn which case you are TA for resenting him being away for ten days (it's ten days, not ten months).\n\nBut if _he_ didn't then let _you_ go away for ten days another time, and he deal with the kids on his own, then he would be TA for the system not being fair.\n\nReally, it would be better to review your sleeping arrangements, get in a professional or read online professional advice to help guide you in teaching your kids to sleep on their own. Or hire a nanny or similar to teach them sleeping and/or help deal with the chaos when longer if you is away.\n\nElse, if you really want to keep your system, then put up with the chaos for ten days gracefully, but then allow yourself (and insist he allows you) to go away some other time with friends or on your own for your own break when you want/need it", "NAH You said you don't wanna hear about how to put your children to sleep, but that is the issue here. You're gonna have to break this habit sooner or later and this would be a good time to start. People go away from time to time, and you can't expect your husband to be around all the time just so your kids can keep up their unusual sleeping habits.", "YTA. It sounds like you both need a break so why don't you go away and stay with friends for a few days.\n\nAs for your kids, you might not want comments on their sleep routine but I have no sympathy for you. By allowing this crazy routine you have caused the problems you are now facing", "Get that you think you have a system that works, but obviously it doesn't work so you need to change the system. Being mad at your husband is not going to solve anything.", "ESH. You have zero support and your husband seems to be allowed to do what he wants anytime while you are left figuring out how to care for the kids. This time his friend has cancer so I understand him going to be him. You're allowed to be mad, you can feel whatever you want, but taking it out on him is a different story. How things are going with the kids isn't sustainable. Something tells me this is likely going to happen again where you're left alone and having to deal with them so may be a good idea to fix it as you're the one who will continue to suffer", "YTA I empathise with you. Your situation is tough. However it\u2019s unreasonable to deny your husband his joy. Don\u2019t be that spouse who \u201clets\u201d their partner go somewhere but then makes their partner miserable about it.", "Girl what??? Be serious, his friend has a life-threatening condition and made this relatively simple request. Your husband will be back and you can talk to him about taking over childcare while you recuperate your sleep. You can also talk to him about getting a babysitter or a nanny for the kids. \n\nYou would be TA if you took out your anger on him over this.

There\u2019s a saying, \u201cYou made your bed and now you get to lay in it.\u201d Literally, you did this to yourself. Put the baby in a crib where she can sleep undisturbed.

But it was 1 week of hell then slowly but surely he got up less and less until he was just sleeping through the night.\n\nI highly disagree that sleep trainers do not understand a child\u2019s mind. They react poorly because they are young and every change is hard for them at their early years. My toddler reacts poorly every time I tell him he can\u2019t have a sweet before bedtime, or every time I tell him to clean up his toys. He throws GIANT fits sometimes. He cries loud enough for CPS to hear. That doesn\u2019t mean what I\u2019m doing is wrong. Sleep is no different. Eventually a child understands and adjusts. They are a lot hardier and resilient than we give them credit for.\n\nThat aside, regardless of how much we disagree, the reality is, this system clearly does not work for either of you. If it did, you wouldn\u2019t be here posting on AITA. Maybe get the help of some professionals and consider seeing some sleep specialists for children?", "Persistence is key. The kid isn\u2019t dying, he\u2019s just a bit scared. It\u2019s not going to traumatize him. Take it from someone whose parents didn\u2019t stop allowing them to co-sleep until they were 12! I wish my parents had done their jobs sooner. Now with my children, I made sure to sleep train them as soon as they were born and it\u2019s been heavenly. Full night sleepers who aren\u2019t afraid of anything in their rooms because they\u2019re used to it. Look up different methods to try again. I used the Gerber method, I believe it\u2019s called. Set a routine. Dinner, warm bath with soothing salts, lotion rub down, bedtime story, and then bed. If they cry? Let them cry a bit, then go in and comfort, let them whine a bit longer each time until they understand they have to stay in bed. There\u2019s nothing wrong or abusive about it because you\u2019re still present, just not engaging with the behavior.", "How do you guys keep making kids with all these kids in the room? \n\nYour kitchen or lounge room must see some action, kudos.", "I have 2 children and co-sleep/bedshare.

Also do you guys have a support system that would allow you friends or family to come help out a bit during the day so you could get a few hours of sleep to help recover at least untill he comes back. When talking on the phone with him you should always be honest with your husband. It's ok tell tell him your overwhelmed right now. Three young kids alone will do that to anyone.
