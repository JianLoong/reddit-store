We co-sleep with 3 children. So my 4 year old wakes up a lot and is usually with his dad through the night as he likes to hug and sleep with him and my husband is ok with that. They both enjoy their nights with each other. My 4yo son was like this from birth, he felt more secure sleeping by me or my husband. I usually sleep with my youngest baby, who is 5 months old. She gets woken up by the slightest noise, if my other kid make snoring sound, she wakes up and its hard to put her back to sleep. My middle child is the sleep through the night, for most nights. So basically, I find nights really hard without my husband\u2026 \n\nMy husband decided to go on a religious pilgrimage to Mecca with his friend who has cancer and is not well and he wanted my husband to accompany him so he is not alone and in case his health takes a toll. They have gone to a religious pilgrimage before too, so its not like they haven\u2019t been there. I understand his friend needs him as he might need support. \n\nI am just mad at him for leaving me for 10 days with sleepless night. I don\u2019t know how to deal with this, I am not sure if I have the right to be or stay mad at him.\n\nMy 4yo wanders around in the house at 2am and is constantly up and uncomfortable as he is used to his dad. And when he does that, my 5 months old is up. I only get few minutes of sleep. I want to cry so much cos I am so tired. My husband rang today and I didn\u2019t wanna congratulate him on his completion on his pilgrimage. AITA for being mad at him? Or should I put my being mad aside and be happy for him.

Your talking about 10 days of stress/lack of sleep, not dying.", "I don't really know what judgement to give here. Maybe ESH?\n\nBut I feel like your current system doesn't \"work for kids and all of us\" if neither parent can be away overnight.\n\nI'm not saying I have a solution or know better, but I am questioning if you can truly say this \"works\". Its more like it meets the minimum threshold for tolerable while also chaining you and your husband to the house.", "YTA. You say your arrangement works for you when clearly it doesn't. It isn't sustainable. Your husband's friend needed him at this time and you are exhausted because of an arrangement that you as a couple have enabled. You need to put proper sleeping arrangements into use, with the help of a professional. You cannot be mad at your husband for something that is the product of your own doing.", "YTA. There are plenty of single mothers/fathers that make it work for YEARS, much less 10 days. \nThis is called life, things happen and people need to take trips. I don\u2019t know why you thought you would be entitled to 100% of your husbands life. \nHorrible sleeping habits aside, it\u2019s very selfish of you to demand your husband be home instead of him being with a friend WHK HAS CANCER. \nYou say you understand, but you clearly don\u2019t. You absolutely don\u2019t have the right to stay mad at him.", "Esh for not putting a system in place that could even potentially succeed here. You both 100% knew this would fail and went forward anyway. I sympathize on the utter fatigue, but both of y'all saw this coming", "On balance, YTA\n\nOne (and my initial) view would be that the system you have is poor and needs changing. In which case since the two of you developed the system, it would be your joint problem, and everyone would suck here. But you have dismissed this view from the very start.\n\nSo with the constraint that we must keep your system, then either:\n\na) Neither of you can ever leave overnight ever for any reason, or\n\nb) When one of you leaves, the other will just have to put up with the chaos\n\nOption (a) seems unreasonable and you would probably be TA for effectively demanding that your husband never goes away for any reason for years. It would be equally bad if he demanded the same thing in reverse. Given your husband had gone away, he's clearly not thinking that option (a) is in play.\n\nSo (b) is a lot more workable as it allows you both a chance to lead a life that is not limited by this requirement to be back home every single night.\n\nIn which case you are TA for resenting him being away for ten days (it's ten days, not ten months).\n\nBut if _he_ didn't then let _you_ go away for ten days another time, and he deal with the kids on his own, then he would be TA for the system not being fair.\n\nReally, it would be better to review your sleeping arrangements, get in a professional or read online professional advice to help guide you in teaching your kids to sleep on their own. Or hire a nanny or similar to teach them sleeping and/or help deal with the chaos when longer if you is away.\n\nElse, if you really want to keep your system, then put up with the chaos for ten days gracefully, but then allow yourself (and insist he allows you) to go away some other time with friends or on your own for your own break when you want/need it", "NAH You said you don't wanna hear about how to put your children to sleep, but that is the issue here. You're gonna have to break this habit sooner or later and this would be a good time to start. People go away from time to time, and you can't expect your husband to be around all the time just so your kids can keep up their unusual sleeping habits.", "YTA. It sounds like you both need a break so why don't you go away and stay with friends for a few days.\n\nAs for your kids, you might not want comments on their sleep routine but I have no sympathy for you. By allowing this crazy routine you have caused the problems you are now facing", "Get that you think you have a system that works, but obviously it doesn't work so you need to change the system. Being mad at your husband is not going to solve anything.", "ESH. You have zero support and your husband seems to be allowed to do what he wants anytime while you are left figuring out how to care for the kids. This time his friend has cancer so I understand him going to be him. You're allowed to be mad, you can feel whatever you want, but taking it out on him is a different story. How things are going with the kids isn't sustainable. Something tells me this is likely going to happen again where you're left alone and having to deal with them so may be a good idea to fix it as you're the one who will continue to suffer", "YTA I empathise with you. Your situation is tough. However it\u2019s unreasonable to deny your husband his joy. Don\u2019t be that spouse who \u201clets\u201d their partner go somewhere but then makes their partner miserable about it.", "Girl what??? Be serious, his friend has a life-threatening condition and made this relatively simple request. Your husband will be back and you can talk to him about taking over childcare while you recuperate your sleep. You can also talk to him about getting a babysitter or a nanny for the kids. \n\nYou would be TA if you took out your anger on him over this. Be for real and put yourself in his shoes\u2014what if this was one of your close friends???", "YTA. There\u2019s a saying, \u201cYou made your bed and now you get to lay in it.\u201d Literally, you did this to yourself. Put the baby in a crib where she can sleep undisturbed.

But it was 1 week of hell then slowly but surely he got up less and less until he was just sleeping through the night.\n\nI highly disagree that sleep trainers do not understand a child\u2019s mind. They react poorly because they are young and every change is hard for them at their early years. My toddler reacts poorly every time I tell him he can\u2019t have a sweet before bedtime, or every time I tell him to clean up his toys. He throws GIANT fits sometimes. He cries loud enough for CPS to hear. That doesn\u2019t mean what I\u2019m doing is wrong. Sleep is no different. Eventually a child understands and adjusts. They are a lot hardier and resilient than we give them credit for.\n\nThat aside, regardless of how much we disagree, the reality is, this system clearly does not work for either of you. If it did, you wouldn\u2019t be here posting on AITA. Maybe get the help of some professionals and consider seeing some sleep specialists for children?", "Persistence is key. The kid isn\u2019t dying, he\u2019s just a bit scared. It\u2019s not going to traumatize him. Take it from someone whose parents didn\u2019t stop allowing them to co-sleep until they were 12! I wish my parents had done their jobs sooner. Now with my children, I made sure to sleep train them as soon as they were born and it\u2019s been heavenly. Full night sleepers who aren\u2019t afraid of anything in their rooms because they\u2019re used to it. Look up different methods to try again. I used the Gerber method, I believe it\u2019s called. Set a routine. Dinner, warm bath with soothing salts, lotion rub down, bedtime story, and then bed. If they cry? Let them cry a bit, then go in and comfort, let them whine a bit longer each time until they understand they have to stay in bed. There\u2019s nothing wrong or abusive about it because you\u2019re still present, just not engaging with the behavior.", "How do you guys keep making kids with all these kids in the room? \n\nYour kitchen or lounge room must see some action, kudos.", "I have 2 children and co-sleep/bedshare. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything inherently wrong with it. In fact I think it\u2019s our natural state. I\u2019m an adult human but I sleep better with my husband than without. Some babies are also more high need than other so I understand what you mean when you say he was born this way. That said, this system does not work for you. Your (primary) problem isn\u2019t the bed sharing it\u2019s that your son will only sleep with your husband. How/where does he nap and what did y\u2019all do to prepare him for dad\u2019s absence?", "My kids didn't sleep. We had to keep telling the doctors that something was not ok. There are different ways to sleep train.\n\nAlso any changes will take more than two days to work themselves out. Yes, it's gonna be rough. Your son is gonna hate it but you need to think of the long game.\n\nYour oldest sounds like mine, a little. Mine is neurodiverse. It does make a difference. You still need to get a system where people can sleep. ALL the people, especially you. You can't be a good mom while exhausted.", "Do what you need to do, but this arrangement is very clearly not working for you currently, and I don\u2019t know why you think it\u2019s going to get better as they get older, bigger and more accustomed to this situation. You are fostering codependency with your kids. I know it\u2019s hard, but it will be harder to undo the damage you\u2019ve done if you let it continue. How does 1.5 decades of no-sleep sound?", "Sure you can. There are diffeenrt mrthods. When we transitioned our daugher to sleeping in her own room when she wss 2, we started off by putting her in the same room with her brother in her oan bed. We'd sit beside the bed until she fell asleep. \n\nThe first few nights, she'd come to our room in the middle of the night. Then she started crawling in bed with her brother on the nights she did wake. We had to sit in there until she was asleep for the first couple of months, then started skipping out as she was drowsy. Soon, she was fine with a bedtime story amd a goodnight kiss. When she was a little bigger, we transitioned her into her own room. It takes a bit of time, but very few tears were shed and it worked fine. \n\nUntil your husband returns, can someone come watch thrm for awhile during the day or eveming so you can have a few hours of uninterrupted sleep?  And when he does return, he needs to stop and think about what he's doing to you by insisting on this system.", "Ok", "As someone who co-slept with their parents until they were 14 I 100% agree with this. Even at 14 I freaked out and threw a tantrum when I was forced to sleep by myself because I never learnt how to sleep by myself. The screaming and crying is inevitable at any age. I could\u2019ve had many more restful nights had I learnt how to sleep by myself when I was much younger.", "What do you mean by neurodiverse, i keep thinking he may have Autism or adhd a mild form\u2026 but he\u2019s fine during the day, but has violent crazy meltdowns when he\u2019s exhausted, so I try comfort him\u2026", "How did you sleep train?", "Maybe you\u2019re right. We should try again. My eldest seem so uneasy at night without my husband. He\u2019s wandering around, as if his pillow is missing (my husband). I don\u2019t want to be mad about my husband, it just comes to me like, does he not care about me? Did he think through. Maybe he doesn\u2019t care. I\u2019m just tired and will probably be okay later when he\u2019s back. But yeah, maybe we should try again. The last time I did. He was broken. And wasn\u2019t normal the next few days and his sleep got worse.", "I literally think the lack of sleep I experienced contributed to several mental health hurdles over the years. Childrens\u2019 brains develop while they sleep, that\u2019s how they learn. Literally, it\u2019s called \u201cwonder leaps\u201d where they wake up with new skills. I feel stunted in many areas because of it.", "Mine's got some solid adhd that we've figured out and sensory issues.\n\nMy son went from cosleeping, to sleeping in his own bed (eventually omg it took months) but honestly, it needed to happen. And now he can't handle so many things at bedtime because he needs things quiet so he can sleep. But he's wonderful in the morning again.\n\nCheck with sleep trainers again but make sure they know that you think he's got a diagnosis. It will and it wont change what has to happen.\n\nIt is going to suck. He will definitely hate it. Honestly, we did a gentle sleep training kind of thing until we literally could not manage. By then our son had a better idea of what to do/how to fall asleep on his own.\n\nThink of his sleeping like this. He has been eating the most wonderful treats. But it's not good to eat only treats, he has got to get some regular food into his system. Is he going to be happy to not have his special treats anymore? No. And honestly, why would he? But it still has to happen.", "It\u2019s your job as a parent to teach your kid how to self sooth. He needs to learn how to practice distress tolerance, and sleeping on his own might be a good start. But get a therapist you can work with to help, you don\u2019t have to feel like you have to take this on alone!"]}
