Yes I\u2019m happy they are happy and my parents accept them and their boyfriends. My dad deep down has struggled his only sons are both gay I understand it must be very hard as a father. They are keeping it a secret from our grandparents as my grandad is very old school and set in his way. My one brother lives with his boyfriends so it\u2019s kind of out of sight out of mind and my other brother sometimes has his boyfriend come over and stay at our family home which has been abit hard for me to get use to especially because that\u2019s the brother we were all shocked about. Anyway I\u2019m getting married this year my fianc\u00e9s family are a different religion that gay marriages are not accepted so they don\u2019t know any gay people they haven\u2019t been brought up around and some of them are typical men and lads that would make jokes about gay people they don\u2019t know about my brothers I\u2019ve never been in a situation to announce both my brothers are gay like it\u2019s some sort of breaking news. So the last thing I want on my wedding is everyone to be shocked and make jokes amongst themselves that my two brothers are gay, the thought of that gives me bad anxiety. I know it would be the talk of the day. I completely understand it really horrible especially for my brothers telling their boyfriends they can\u2019t come but it\u2019s my big day I don\u2019t want to be stressing thinking omg everyone is talking about both my brothers being gay. I care about my brothers! One of them has said his not going to come which has upset me and I feel like the other one will now change his mind and say his not going to come.

Yes I\u2019m happy they are happy and my parents accept them and their boyfriends. My dad deep down has struggled his only sons are both gay I understand it must be very hard as a father. They are keeping it a secret from our grandparents as my grandad is very old school and set in his way. My one brother lives with his boyfriends so it\u2019s kind of out of sight out of mind and my other brother sometimes has his boyfriend come over and stay at our family home which has been abit hard for me to get use to especially because that\u2019s the brother we were all shocked about. Anyway I\u2019m getting married this year my fianc\u00e9s family are a different religion that gay marriages are not accepted so they don\u2019t know any gay people they haven\u2019t been brought up around and some of them are typical men and lads that would make jokes about gay people they don\u2019t know about my brothers I\u2019ve never been in a situation to announce both my brothers are gay like it\u2019s some sort of breaking news. So the last thing I want on my wedding is everyone to be shocked and make jokes amongst themselves that my two brothers are gay, the thought of that gives me bad anxiety. I know it would be the talk of the day. I completely understand it really horrible especially for my brothers telling their boyfriends they can\u2019t come but it\u2019s my big day I don\u2019t want to be stressing thinking omg everyone is talking about both my brothers being gay. I care about my brothers! One of them has said his not going to come which has upset me and I feel like the other one will now change his mind and say his not going to come. I\u2019m living in a nightmare this should be an exciting time for me but I\u2019m on the verge of a breakdown because of the arguments it\u2019s causing\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Tell your fianc\u00e9e you will not stand for any derogatory homosexual reference from anyone, especially him.

It is also important to support your brothers and stand up for them in situations like this. You can try to have a conversation with your fianc\u00e9 and their family to make it clear that such behavior will not be tolerated at your wedding, and that your brothers are an important part of your life and should be treated with kindness and respect.   \n\n\nIt is also worth considering talking to your brothers and finding out how they feel about the situation, and whether they are comfortable attending the wedding. It is important to prioritize their feelings and well-being as well. Ultimately, it is important to remember that love and acceptance should be at the heart of any family, and that it is never too late to work towards creating a more supportive and inclusive environment for everyone.  \n\n\nYou truly don't want to start a new chapter of your life with animosity towards any member of your family. You want to remember the event as a day full of love and appreciation. Do the right thing for yourself and your family.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re clearly not okay with your brothers being gay.
