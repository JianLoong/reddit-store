I really loved him and forgave a lot because he seemed like someone who just needs a little guidance to fully bloom. And then this happened and I totally lost all my feelings and am just appalled and horrified.", "Actually. To add more details to this story. We were sitting outside in a pizza bar, watching a random little kid doing whatever he wants while his dad was sitting with his pals in a garden of the cafe. Well, this stranger's kid ran behind the big bushes and dad didn't react. I was saying how it is unsafe because there is a really busy and wide road next to it. Also, that stranger's kid apparently has autism problems and what could happen if left unsupervised like that. (He knew about autism since he is local in that neighborhood.)\n\nIn that moment, I was speaking with my Mum (who is a doctor) on the phone about it as well and she said, well, I've seen mothers giving their children cigarettes as to show me how worse a childcare can get. And after we hang a call, I mentioned to my (ex)-BF what my mum said and he proceeded with showing me that video and laughing. I couldn't believe my eyes. How in the world he could think it was funny and appropriate. I would have been ashamed, yet he was finding fun in it....", "Thanks a lot for the explanation of his reaction. I appreciate it!", "My heart dropped even at imagining all of this. And I used to be a smoker for 4 years and quit a few months ago. Always said I will quit it years before having a child because I can't imagine getting pregnant even a little after stopping smoking. And even as a smoker or a former-smoker I could have never ever done that to any child because I was always aware how bad it is.", "I don't know. I am not sure who was this person all along and why even his friends who I viewed as conscious people in his life, don't see a big deal with that, but do see with me reacting the way I did.", "Oh no, I'm so sorry that happened to you... I'm glad that you see it wasn't right and that you still treat your family with respect because it's family. Though I'm so, so, sorry you got trauma left after that... Hopefully you manage through it as life goes on.. :(", "I understand.. Though, I imagined what if he started coughing up uncontrollably...", "Not sure how it works here. Third world country.", "It's his uncle's son. And his uncle and him were both doing it to the baby on the video.", "I see what do you mean. Though, from what I know, kids at that age go through rapid brain development and any toxic effect has permanent imprint on brain. So like, it's not the same to smoke as a kid, teenager, or an adult.\n\nAnd I wouldn't say kids are stupid, rather acting on impulses without having a proper conscious understanding of the causalities of their actions. While adults do, so that's how I reasoned.\n\nWhat do you propose was a right way to respond in that situation? Would you be able to trust that person with a kid?", "Sadly, yes. Because apparently, not only him thinks I am overreacting so I turned to Reddit to see am I really overreacting. My friend stands by my side, but I didn't tell anyone besides her and Redditors. While he did and he got support.", "It was a video. My ex and his uncle were across that toddler who was sitting. It was looking around and one of them put cigarette in his mouth and adjusting it, also I think someone paid attention so his hands don't touch the cigarette. My ex-BF was filming. So, one of them readjusted the cigarette so it sits properly (I'm feeling sick already by writing this...) and the ex-BF's uncle (child's father) actually had it light up. I couldn't watch it to the end. I flipped, started throwing words of anger.", "And prep their own needles \ud83d\udc89", "important life knowledge", "Never settle for anybody who still needs guidance to suit your expectations. It's the \"I Could Fix Him\" repackaged...", "I just can't even...... wow. Your mind had to have been racing. How the hell could his ever be funny, in any context...... ever? I'm appalled for you. I can't think of any way he could ever be sexy to me again. Sorry OP, that's a weird thing to happen and completely unexpected.\n\nI guess it could have been worse. Imagine if he said this while out with your friends? I know he has no shame, but you do. I'd die from embarrassment due to being with a person who does this and currently thinks it's funny. \n\nWell, back to the dating pool. Haha", "It didnt hurt me mentally. Some memories are weird I remember at 4 sitting with my sister with formula in both of our hands and we played a bit. And forgetting what I were doing 5 minutes ago. It just made me physically uncomfortable. Or yes maybe that is considered trauma but the only thing it impacted is just I wont touch cigars in my life forever", "Not really I would blame mom for this. She and I have different \"sense of humor\"  she mocked me because I cant spell R occassionally and whenever I got upset she just said \"you have zero sense of humor\" kind of thing", "It's unlikely you can get a copy of the video, but that's something you could report. He wouldn't get apprehended for just that, but uncle might get a scare.", "I\u2019d be pretty shocked to learn that not even hitting a single cig has a negative effect on the child\u2019s brain. If this is such a big concern, the child shouldn\u2019t be allowed in a house with a gas stove because that\u2019s linked to like 1/5 asthma cases and is a carcinogen.\n\nEssentially everything we do isn\u2019t good for us, and I\u2019d love to see a scientific (so not just your opinion) study on the effects of this, because I inhale more smoke sitting by a bonfire than this baby did smoking. \n\nYes, kids are stupid. Even according to you they\u2019re still undergoing that rapid brain development which means underdeveloped brains, AKA stupid. It\u2019s not personal, but they are and we all went through it lol.\n\nThe \u201cright\u201d response is to let them know you\u2019re mad and to not do it again. They\u2019re not an abuser like you said, and throwing these absurd insults just makes more tension.\n\nI\u2019m genuinely sorry you don\u2019t recognize that literally all around them in the real world are carcinogens, potential danger, and their own potentially dangerous choices. Our bodies are meant to be able to handle these in reasonable amounts, which is why we don\u2019t die from inhaling a bit of smoke in fires.\n\nShow some medical literature on the subject before you make bold claims like calling someone an abuser with no morality, because I guarantee the effects are less than you think for the 1/3 puff of a single cig \ud83d\ude02", "One more thing actually. Would you have said those same insults and been as mad if he instead brought the baby to a high smog area to get somewhere? If your answer is anything other than yes than YTA.", "Do you think children live in a bubble of filtered air? They breathe in pollutants every single day, often including cigarette smoke from second or third hand sources. \n\nYou massively overreacted. One draw on a cigarette is not going to damage their brain forever. It's certainly not going to kill them. It's a stupid thing to do but calling them an abuser? Way over the top. Calling someone you are supposed to care about an abuser with no morals is extremely harsh and not something he will (or should) forget in a hurry.", "That's sad... Though I glad you were so pure, since you were a kid, that your body and mind decided to never smoke in your life...", "I'm sorry but I don't see it as funny, either... Aren't parents supposed to be supportive... It's not humor if it hurts somebody, is it?", "Good to know, thanks. Sadly yes, I probably won't be able to get a copy of the video. He said that his mom (who is a nurse) and his uncle's wife did not like it, but in a way that they just commented: \"Don't be silly!\". If I was the wife, I would have divorced him...", "To this day I still remember that sensation and cough following after. My mom is occassional smoker. She just smoke whenever her BIL smoke because the price of cigars is expensive that she just used her BIL's. And stay away from me whenever she smokes", "For my mom it is. ( Fortunately she knows how to stop ) I did a lot of weird and embarassing thing ( sometimes I wonder if I am on spectrum because that behavior of mine isnt normal ex standing behind the basketball ring when in sports time )\nBut she is supportive in serius Cases. Maybe because of that treatment i always shy about everything.  Or maybe I am born this way", "I just watched a lecture not so long ago, how certain weird things that kids do are actually part of the development process and the discovering of themselves, since they stop after the kid has grew up. And kid shouldn't be punished for its idiosyncrasies.\n\nAnd it's good to protect a kid in serious situations, but also nudge a kid to stand for themselves. Though I think today we went far with that advice and sometimes person stands up for themselves without even thinking if they were 'attacked' for a reason.\n\nMaybe you are just confused by lots of unexpected things that happened through your childhood and didn't develop healthy amount of confidence...?\n\nBut, I doubt it's that serious. What do you think of maybe going out for a walk on a sunny day, on your own? Observing the nature, or listening to music or a podcast? Also, as far as I know, physical activities reduce the tension, by directly affecting biochemistry in our brain. Frankly, our emotions are a bunch of chemicals reacting in and with our brain. Also, anyone's brain structure and chemical exposure is different, that's why we're different. But if you see that something is not okay, you can alter its structure by doing certain activites. Like laughing, for example, does you well even if you're not happy. Or sports, dancing, reading, singing. You just have to try and do one different thing at first. See what happens! I like to assemble puzzles, for example.\n\nLooking forward to hearing a more upbeat messages from you, in the future! Fingers crossed!", "NTA, also he's wild for acting like making a baby smoke is a classy city thing and you're a low-class hick for disliking it.", "Take his advise and leave!
