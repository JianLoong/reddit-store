I am a long time lurker and hope you may help my situation. My son (16m) has been peeing in the bathtub. We moved into this house 2 months ago and the toilet is quite old and loud so my son is hesitant to flush it at night. \n\nMy husband is a very light sleeper and the flush will wake him up but he has a very hard time falling back asleep. To counteract this issue our son has began to pee in the bathtub as to not make a noise. We have told him its okay to flush or to shut the toilet lid but he will not. I often wake up and have to scrub the tub before i can take a shower before work. The texture of the tub is strange so i have to scrub it or it will linger and start to stink. \n\nSunday night i sprained my ankle and must sit in the tub to shower. Today i woke up a little late, which would not have been an issue if my son either cleaned up after himself or used the toilet. My husband was watering the garden so i called my son into the bathroom. I again told him to use the toilet or wash the tub himself directly after using it. This time though i demanded he clean it right then and there. He refused, saying it\u2019s disgusting and its our fault because we have not gotten a new toilet yet. I told him toilet is being replaced by the landlord on the first of September (he has known this) and he proceeded to call me over dramatic and demanding. I was incredibly upset at this point so i told him to leave. I did not want to yell at him and i had to get ready so i said \u201cGet the hell out of here, your father and i will discuss this later\u201d he asked where he should go and i said \u201cI don\u2019t care, anywhere but here.\u201d\n\nIt was in reference to us both being in the bathroom but my husband stormed in a few minutes later yelling about how I \u201ccan\u2019t kick our son out\u201d.

I fully admit this is reaching, but, based on all of this: kid may have clinical anxiety.  \n\nIt wouldn't require the dad or OP to be abusive or nasty.  If you have anxiety, your brain can conjure all of that stuff to be afraid of, without it necessarily being true.  That's the thing about clinical anxiety: your brain is lying to you.  \n\nSo they move into this place, the toilet is so loud that flushing it at night wakes up the Dad.  They discover this, and discover that Dad can't fall asleep again easily.  He is probably grouching about this, and that may  not be aimed AT anyone (and may not be nasty or abusive).  But now the son is afraid to make ANY noise, at all, that MIGHT wake the Dad.\n\nAnd another piece is him leaping right to \"Mom is kicking me out of the house\" after this argument.  Yeah, OP is right, she could have been a little more explicit?  But she didn't think she had a reason to, because even most kids would likely hear \"get out of this room\" and not \"pack your bags and go live on the streets\".   Being yelled at, and having a parent mad at you, is one thing; this kid is leaping right to the most catastrophic reading of it.\n\n(None of that explains why the hell he won't just pee, and put the lid down, so it can be flushed in the morning.  Nevermind not wanting to make noise, a lot of people do that just to save water.)\n\nI don't know. Maybe you guys are right and Dad's reaction to being woken up feels more threatening to the kid than he or Mom realize. (Because OP doesn't seem to think that's a factor or think that Dad is being particularly mad.)   \n\nBut what's weird about that is -- Mom, and also to some extent Dad (?), are not real happy with him doing what he's doing, either.  Or maybe that's just Mom (who gets to it first and has to clean it)?  And the kid doesn't seem worried about continuing to do something his parents have ALSO told him they don't want him doing.\n\nAs usual, I'm reading this and I'm relating it to my own experiences (which is, after all, what a lot of people do in this sub). I do have clinical anxiety.  I didn't know that for decades, and just coped with it.  And I would definitely go through stretches of time where I was deeply anxious about making any noise at night.  I was anxious about POSSIBLY disturbing someone.  About others being able to tell I was using the bathroom (why? did I think people would think badly of me for using the bathroom in the middle of the night? the whole point is that it doesn't make sense).  But the idea of not flushing was equally anxiety-inducing. (So yeah, I'd flush, and be wincing about how loud it might be.  I truly think nobody ever even woke up.)\n\nDid my parents EVER scold me about making noise by flushing the toilet at night? Nope.  Did this anxiety persist, even when I was in other places and with people I knew on a rational level truly wouldn't care?  Yes.  So it wasn't just tied to \"fear of my parents' anger\" or fear related to authority figures.  Even now, with a diagnosis, and medication, I can still feel twinges of that anxiety when I'm a guest in someone else's home.  It's just easier now to tell myself it's irrational, and put the worry aside.\n\nAnyway.  TMI, I guess.  I just see some of that, maybe, in the kid's behavior here.  Why is peeing in the tub \\*better\\*?  I don't know, but his brain has fixated on that. Yet, in other ways, he's kind of acting like a normal kid -- he doesn't care that someone's going to get up in the morning and find that, and have to clean up after him.", "Why cant he just pee in the toilet and flush in the morning? \n\nLike most people would who worry about waking people, it's a very simple solution", "Ok, but there's a super simple fix to this that you don't mention in your post.
