He doesn't know how to use the washing machine and he refuses to do them by hand. \n\nHe started going commando.  Which just meant the problem was his jeans now.  \n\nSo I said that we might need to take him to the doctor to see what is wrong with him.  If it's physical or psychological.  I also said that the next time his friends were over I was going to ask them is they left their underwear in the same condition.  I WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY EMBARRASS HIM LIKE THAT. He said I was being an asshole and he called his mom to tell her what I was doing.

As others have said 14 is old enough to learn, but it's in that area where they are still children about some things and not others.

BUT, the issue got worse instead of better despite discovering and obviously putting an end to the abuse and treating with therapy. \n\nWhen it got worse after he entered his teens, we had many heated discussions about it. It essentially boiled down to him thinking it was a waste of time. He had gotten really into video games and the computer and eventually confessed he didn't wipe his ass because he didn't want to waste 30 more seconds away from his game. The smell and associated nastiness was not enough of a deterent. It took a lot of uncomfortable talks and persistence and a commando phase to finally work through the problem.

Get him an appointment a few weeks away and tell him what's up. Don't say it to him, but if he can do better in that time frame you can cancel the appointment. You wouldn't need to tell.him. He would be (at least should be) desperate enough to not go for this issue that he would be showing you he can do better. If he doesn't do better, then you're ready to go. If he stops after appointment is canceled then it's more likely a psych issue and you can make an appointment with the appropriate person and not cancel it this time. \n\nThe only thing I will say is just remember this is going to be an embarrassing topic for him to talk about. While it definitely something that needs to be addressed, do what tou can to stay calm.and treat it in the least embarrassing way possible. So, it may be a good idea to say you wouldn't tell/ask his friends that question and you're sorry for saying you would, it was the wrong approach.\n\nETA: talking to his Dr yourself may also.be a smart thing.
