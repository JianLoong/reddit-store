It essentially boiled down to him thinking it was a waste of time. He had gotten really into video games and the computer and eventually confessed he didn't wipe his ass because he didn't want to waste 30 more seconds away from his game.

This is probably not going to be a ln easy and calm convo (my bet is she is going tonget defensiveness bc of how she has already replied) and no reason to stress her out more bc that will make getting better take longer, and also add stress to the convo bc she doesn't feel good. \n\nI think it's also a good idea that you take him to the dr. Get him an appointment a few weeks away and tell him what's up. Don't say it to him, but if he can do better in that time frame you can cancel the appointment. You wouldn't need to tell.him. He would be (at least should be) desperate enough to not go for this issue that he would be showing you he can do better. If he doesn't do better, then you're ready to go. If he stops after appointment is canceled then it's more likely a psych issue and you can make an appointment with the appropriate person and not cancel it this time. \n\nThe only thing I will say is just remember this is going to be an embarrassing topic for him to talk about. While it definitely something that needs to be addressed, do what tou can to stay calm.and treat it in the least embarrassing way possible. So, it may be a good idea to say you wouldn't tell/ask his friends that question and you're sorry for saying you would, it was the wrong approach.\n\nETA: talking to his Dr yourself may also.be a smart thing. His Dr may be able to tell you some things you could do or say to help the situation. Also you are obviously a very caring parent, please don't let anyone tell you that your an ah for this.

With constipation too sometimes bits leak out around the hard poo and he has no idea. \n\nBest way to manage it is so the doctor. Put him on medication so that he is regular and the poo is soft.

You can figure that out, you're very smart.\" Only I couldn't, because the way my autistic brain worked was that I cannot learn things unless I am taught them explicitly, usually by having someone walk through the steps and demonstrate for me while explaining. I do not learn by seeing other people do things alone, or by social exposure. I need to be TAUGHT.

IBS has made me be extra vigilant about hygiene, my habits completely changed and I had to adjust.", "I'm urging a doctor's checkup immediately. It's possible this teen may have painful or bleeding hemorrhoids or other physical issues from bearing down too hard when constipated, and thus finds proper wiping painful. \n\nIt's not clear if this is a recent problem that had cropped up in the last year or so, or an ongoing issue through his life. I hope he gets the help he needs.", "Yep, my kids learned how to do laundry young.  It's a pretty simple skill and is always useful. If they can play video games, they can figure out the washing machine.  It's not like I'm sending them with a wash board and a basin down to the river.", "hi I have ADHD and I come from a family full of people with ADHD and I just want to say: thank you so much for teaching your son these skills early enough that they will likely be second nature later on. I brush my teeth every day no problem but *god* it has been a *bitch and a half* learning to do basic household chores regularly. and it never, ever gets easier. at least, not through repetition. the only thing that has ever helped is meds. without them, it just. never gets easier.", "That's such as shitty myth. No woman should date a shitty guy (or woman).", "Exactly, a 14 year old knows how to play video games or use a microwave. \n\nDoing laundry? All it takes is to push a button. How difficult can it be?", "Agreed. I taught my eldest how to put in the washing 18 months ago (when he was 8). Granted, we use the laundry pods so it's easier for him to learn, and while he hasn't done it since I know he can do it. I was pregnant and having dizzy spells and fainting so he would help put on the laundry, and then he or his brother would transfer to the dryer for me.\n\nOP for this, you are NTA, but HOW ON EARTH DID YOU NOT NOTICE THE SMELL. I mean, come on, surely you walked past him or his dirty washing at least once a day and smelt that funk right.", "I disagree. Now is the moment to target this. Sickness or recovery be damned. \n\nDefensive or not, it's unacceptable.\n\nI'd go so far as to divorce somebody over this. That's how much it disgusts me. Don't get me wrong, I would do all the discussions beforehand but I'd be like \"before we get into any discussion about this, if your position remains the same and is what I think it is, I need you to know that my position is leaving you\".\n\nIt's just not acceptable from a biohazard point of view. From a health point of view. From a social point of view. \n\nThere are ZERO net positives to this. I would not entertain it at all.\n\nI found a new deal breaker for relationships that I didn't know from this thread.", "At his age, we had gym class and had to change into our gym uniforms in a locker room with other kids. Maybe that hasn\u2019t been a thing since 2020 so he hasn\u2019t, but he must smell. I can\u2019t imagine this kid isn\u2019t being bullied into the ground.", "Waiting until a kid asks to learn how to do basic adult skills is not parenting. You have to be proactive about it or he\u2019ll never be a self-sufficient adult.", "It's bloody basics \n\nTry being a dad and teaching him the basics instead of excuses like he shows before you get home.", "I read your comment too fast and thought it said \"my friend who's 6 years old\" lmao", "Not always. You can also get hemorrhoids from diarrhea/frequent pooping even without straining. It is more commonly associated with constipation and straining, of course.", "Also if he is lactose intolerant or has some kind of stomach issue that causes frequent diarrhea, he could be wiping clean everytime and leaking a little after leaving the bathroom. I knew someone that had this issue until they stopped having diarrhea as often", "Right? The comments here are abhorrent. All these people are way too ready to chalk this up to him being a dirty lazy teenager. I hope the people in these comments never become parents. Good lord the horrible judgement here is palpable.", "The entire back end of my mom's house (where my brother's room was) consistently smelled like feet and funky corn chips when he was 15-16.", "I think I learned how to use the washing machine at about his age, but because my dad had accidentally shrunk one of my brand new shirts that I had only worn once but loved.  Had to give that one to my 4th grade youngest sister.  Learned immediately after how to use the washer and dryer so the rest of my clothes would be safe.  \n\nBut yes, therapy and learning to use and clean the washer/dryer is likely definitely needed.  Although if he's like most teenagers, he's going to resist...but I don't think he's going to want to tell his friends \\*why\\* he's going to therapy though.", "Definitely a big L on both parents for not teaching this to begin with. However if they always split the chores with her doing the laundry then there's not really an opportunity for op to even know about this, except if he did some really questionable things. \nBoth parents messed up with teaching but wife let's him live like that despite knowing, while op immediately addressed it.", "Wrong, because it was wife who does the laundry that ignored this.\nOP only discovered it because he's taken over the laundry while mom is sick. It's not really a topic of discussion with your children esp at this age. Mom dropped the ball on this one.", "Thank you! I am surprised I scrolled this far to see this comment! ESH. \n\nHe\u2019s acting like he never noticed before? If he never noticed, then he must be staying 10 feet away from his son at all times. He must not talk with his son or hang out with him. \n\nBecause if it\u2019s as bad as the father claims it to be, there\u2019s no way in hell that he, or his son\u2019s friends, haven\u2019t smelled shit coming off of his son before.\n\nI\u2019m honestly surprised that DSS/CPS hasn\u2019t been involved already! This is beyond neglect. A 14 year old leaving poop to cake on to his ass? Wtf? I\u2019m sorry, but OP\u2019s son need a therapist years ago. \n\nThis is something that the average person just doesn\u2019t do. I would be getting my son checked out for autism; sexual abuse; personality disorders; etc.. \n\nI\u2019d honestly be more worried than pissed, and if anything I\u2019d be more pissed at myself and my wife than my son, because like I said, this is not normal behavior. \n\nYeah his son seems lazy and is acting like a brat, but that\u2019s on his parents as well, for raising him to be this way. I was doing my own laundry at 11. \n\nWe raise children to be functioning members of society, and we do so by teaching them household chores early on, in a way that makes them seem like the normal everyday activities one should do to promote cleanliness. \n\nWe shouldn\u2019t make them seem terrible, or his son will grow up to resent doing household tasks because he views these chores as punishment. He should\u2019ve instilled this into his son years ago with his wife helping him. \n\nI\u2019m going with a light ESH and if anyone is the asshole it\u2019s OP and his wife more than anything, as they are the adults and his parents. And it seems they\u2019ve failed him miserably.", "He just found out about the situation.. his wife has been aware of it for years. They both fucked up not teaching their son how to wipe his ass, but the wife fucked up even more by letting this go on for YEARS", "I'm really shocked that no one who was teaching him how to use the toilet never emphasized the \"wipe until the toilet paper is still clean\" method or thought to maybe use wipes. I know a family (Mom, Dad and 3 boys) who all use wipes instead of toilet tissue and they put them in a trashcan to be disposed of properly--not flushed.", "Yep.  Apparently.  Those people are probably the ones who die of prostate cancer because they never get the prostate checked by a doctor because 'it's gay'.", "I\u2019m sure there are women who don\u2019t clean properly because they\u2019re afraid to touch themselves, although thankfully I think we\u2019re starting to get past that. But I can tell you from experience nobody tells you, as a young woman, to pull back the clitoral hood and clean the area with plain water, or even to be sure to rinse the labial folds. Unless mom does it, but my mother absolutely would never be able to get the words out.", "Yeah this is a dumb assumption. My mom does all the laundry but that's because she is very particular about it. She just doesn't like my dad messing with it so would rather do it herself. All other household chores they split duties on, and pretty much all outdoor tasks my dad does. Just because one partner primarily does one specific task it doesn't mean the other partner doesn't help in other areas.", "Also possibly an allergy to the brand of toilet paper. Many name brands add perfumes and lotions to their toilet papers which can irritate skin and make it uncomfortable to wipe", "That's a failure on the parents but it's not because they didn't teach them how to do laundry. Those men were unable to learn to solve problems by themselves. \n\nI hadn't been asked to do a chore in my life before moving out. Literally day one, I was able to cook, clean, do laundry, and keep my home clean. I used this magical thing called the internet to lookup anything that wasn't intuitive. Budgeting is piss easy too. \n\nThey were lazy and hoping you'd just takeover where their parents left off.", "Same. Way too many boys become men without learning to do their own laundry.", "I started to learn how to do laundry young. I liked helping to sort clothes into piles and so forth. I don't remember when I finally did laundry completely on my own, but definitely by high school. I won't say I enjoyed doing laundry, but it wasn't a big deal and having the habit of doing it makes it a much easier transition when you finally go to college or move out on your own. (OK I love taking towels out of the dryer. That is nice.)\n\nHe doesn't have to tell his friends he's going to therapy. I went to therapy in hs and none of my friends knew about it. I usually just said I had something to do and that was it.", "And if it becomes clear that he CAN do it but for some reason *will* not, that is cause for alarm and urgent therapy.", "She might think it's a teen boy thing he will just outgrow, like how they never wear deodorant.", "The other issue here is the wife knew there was a hygiene issue with their son and failed to tell the OP, the father, about it.  My wife mostly does the laundry (she puts in on, and sorts it, I fold it once its done) in our house, but if there were ever an issue, similar to OP's issue for instance, she would tell me straight away and discuss how to resolve the issue, not just hide it and hope it fixes itself.\n\nOP, you are NTA IMO.  You need to sit both wife and son down and discuss ways to remedy the problem as it is problematic both for a hygienic reason but also for health reasons for everyone involved.  You also need to find out why your wife has not been telling you about issues involving your son and is there anything else she hasn't told you.", "And now she\u2019s trying to convince him it\u2019s not a big deal and to leave it be. \n\nWhat the f kind of enabling parenting is this? At least OP is trying to deal with a very problematic issue.", "Former major appliance manufacturer employee. Bleach doesn\u2019t do a great job killing the mold, it just makes it less visible. Vinegar\u2019s high acidity will do a better job. On a completely related note, you will never catch me owning a front loading washer.", "For real. How can you not communicate with your partner on this?!? OP\u2019s wife is RIDICULOUS. Sincerely now - their **nearly adult child is pooping his pants**. Whether mentally or physically, their kid is very unwell and she just pretends it\u2019s not happening? Bffr. This is straight up neglectful.", "Just a casual passive aggressive comment alluding to the fact she\u2019s been an objectively bad parent and a liability to their son\u2019s future.\n\nAnd then quickly move on lol.", "I refuse to believe this omg. There's no way this is even close to true", "It's gay to touch your butt to wash it. \n\nI'm quite serious, that's the toxic-masculinity logic.", "In all fairness, most people don\u2019t see a specialist like a urologist until things go bad down south. In the US, it\u2019ll get really bad first because our insurance system turns every treatable issue into a goddamn Sophie\u2019s Choice", "I hear you, but if OP and wife divided the chores and it sounds like they did consensually, then it\u2019s on the wife for hiding and coddling the behavior. To the point that she still wants to coddle him instead of correcting it by telling her husband to deal with it until she\u2019s better and can go back to washing poop undies. Her behavior is enabling and toxic; she\u2019s setting him up for failure. It\u2019s embarrassing and uncomfortable, but he\u2019s gotta learn and it\u2019s good that OP immediately took initiative, bought a bidet and is putting effort toward helping his son fix this.", "I don\u2019t know \u2026 it seems like the Mom was deliberately hiding it from him. Just based on her reaction when OP said something she seems to be an enabler. I wonder what else is going on in this kid\u2019s life?", "\\>  The kid made it to 14 without his dad ever looking at his dirty underwear?\n\nYes, because he trusted that his wife, who was seeing his underwear as the person who handled laundry, was keeping on top of any problems that were showing signs.  What do you think he should have done differently?  grilling his wife on everything she handled?  That would be controlling of him.", "Buy those disposable wipes the kid needs to learn how to wipe and properly clean himself. He must stink and kids can be cruel.  I\u2019m skeeved out just reading this one.", "Thanks! That's something I definitely didn't know", "Oh, I meant because where I come from underwear is also called briefs.", "That\u2019s entirely possible, yes. Although she also seems pretty blas\u00e9 about it, saying the kid is just \u201clike that.\u201d So it does seem like she\u2019s just been unconcerned and never mentioned it because for some unfathomable reason she just didn\u2019t think it was an issue. It\u2019s hard to tell from just this post.", "But be aware that flushable wipes are NOT really flushable, no matter what the label says, and will screw up your plumbing in an expensive way.", "This is what we had to do for a while when my kid had this problem. But he was like\u2026 7 or 8, not 14.", "Ohhhhhhhh\n\nI\u2019m so sorry I have a condition, it\u2019s called being dense", "Maybe mom does the laundry while dad's at work? \n\nRegardless, does anyone else think that 14 years old is too old to not know how to work the washing machine? \n\nBetween that much less egregious problem and the poop, I can't help but to feel like this family isn't good at teaching their kid important life skills."]}
