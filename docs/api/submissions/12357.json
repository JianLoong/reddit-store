Please don\u2019t change YOUR parenting style.", "NTA. You are a good father, you did what was right instead of what was easy. As someone who has had to clean feces out of a urinal, thank you.", "no, you were right, you dont want your son to grow up to be an animal, nip that shit in the bud NOW. (Which you did.)", "NTA. You are an amazing parent. That was a natural consequence for your son's disgusting actions. It sounds like your wife may be a bit of an enabler. Your son is very lucky to have you.", "Obviously NTA. \n\nWho is supposed to clean up his mess? The minimum wage TB workers?", "Your wife is on crack NTA \n\nWhile I give your son credit for actually managing to land one in the urinal, he is old enough to know better and understand the repercussions of his actions.

My condolences.\n\nYou were right.  The staff is not there ti wipe your son's ass.  Tell that to your wife.  If your son was humilated and degraded, then there is hope for your son t develop a conscience that would stop him from makign these poor choices and exercise some better judgement.  Your wife, maybe not so much.  Again, my condolences.  You married a real piece of work who would condone such disgusting behavior and then act entitled to think someone else should clean our son's shit.  Absolutely disgusting and appalling behavior from your wife and son.  NTA.  You did the right thing.", "NTA.\n\n\nYou are a good father ... and are raising a kid as he is supposed to be raised.", "Your wife's stance on this is humiliating and embarassing. She needs to learn some common courtesy/decency. The world would be a better place if people CLEANED UP AFTER THEMSELVES- like you're teaching your son to do.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA you are a hero!

He\u2019s not a toddler and it sure shouldn\u2019t have been left for the staff to clean. Good job!", "NTA.. I would do the same thing. We\u2019ve all had minimum wage jobs as teens.

With that said, knowing that a urinal isn't meant for that, the person who crapped in it should clean it. Your son being embarrassed is because he was caught. Your wife probably has no idea that a urinal isn't quite the same as a toilet (size to lush things down). Crap in a urinal is a mess to clean and causes it to clog when trying to flush an oversize load down. \n\nSeeing you were waiting on the food, has me thinking this wasn't a bathroom emergency (just dumb teenage shit). Taking a crap in urinals has been this weird thing teenagers think is funny for a while now. \n\nYour wife can be furious all she wants- she wasn't the one who would have had to clean it up. If she has issues with you holding your son accountable for his wrong doings, then she will enable bad behavior and your son will continue to do this kind of crap. She could also be embarrassed because her son is associated with her, and someone out there knows that her son took a crap in the urinal at taco bell. No matter what you made the right call on handling the situation.", "NTA at all, would be way more of an asshole move to just move on and expect some Taco Bell employee to deal with it", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nI am sure your wife herself makes faces in disgust and calls people uneducated for leaving public restrooms dirty and believe me this was way disgusting. As for your son, I hope he understands that atleast someone in his house is 'educated' and not just literate.", "NTA, your wife is. It\u2019s humiliating for the one having to clean it up that is just doing their job. Why was your son pooping in the urinal in the first place? Gross. Good of you to make him clean it up.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife sure is though.\n\nI'm proud of you. You were doing what I wish more parents would do, make their little shit clean up their own shit (maybe yours isn't a little shit, but most of em who do that are). Making him clean it, instead of some poor minimum wage employee, was responsible. And it'll teach your kid to not grow up to be an asshole.", "NTA. He chose to humiliate and degrade himself by shitting in a urinal and leaving it for someone else to clean. I hope this isn't some new TikTok challenge, but expecting a worker to clean your biohazard is disgusting.", "NTA - but can you explain WHY he pooped in a urinal? I don't understand. Was it supposed to be a prank? Were the stalls with toilets all occupied? WHY DO PEOPLE DO STUFF LIKE THAT?\n\nYour wife's reaction sucks, BTW. It seems like she is okay with raising an entitled monster who has no empathy for others. Good job for not letting your son get away with this ... crap.", "NTA- if my husband came home and told me that the first question out of my mouth would be you made him clean it up, right? My brother did something stupid involving the Justice system when he was younger and my mom made him go to court, the whole nine yards.

Why would your wife think it would be okay to leave that for (likely) another teenager to clean up?!?", "NTA! What on earth would give him that bright idea? Like seriously!?

Your son was absolutely wrong in this matter.  Instead of covering for him, you made him own up to his mistake.  This will make him think twice before doing something like that again.  I wish more parents would do that.  Well done!", "NTA - your wife has been far too indulgent with your teenage son and this is the REASON he could do something so outrageous and not give any thought to how someone else would be affected.  Sons like yours end up in jail if they don't have a father like you who at least ATTEMPTS to counteract her indulgence.  Ordinarily I like dads and moms to try to get on the same page and back each other up but I'm sorry to tell you your wife has become totally fucking unreliable.  Keep doing the best you can under less than ideal circumstances.", "NTA. I can't help wondering what is wrong with your son that he'd do such a thing in the first place. Is he mentally ill? If so, get him some treatment. Making him clean up after himself was appropriate. It would have been wrong to leave it for someone else to clean up. You did right. I do hope you didn't have him flush the paper towels along with the poop though, because that might back up the plumbing. The paper towels should have gone into the trash.", "NTA and bravo!", "NTA - Next time call your wife and make her come clean it up.

How rude. No you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA! Thank you for making your teenage son be a better human!!", "NTA. good job. Actions have consequences. unlikely he'll do it again!. Bravo - keep up the good work! Also, why did he crap in the trough?", "NTA- your wife sure is. She is teaching your son that life has no responsibilities and that doing what he did was acceptable. It\u2019s not. Staff should not have to clean up after your son for doing something disgusting like that. It\u2019s degrading to them. Your wife is teaching your son that service people deserve to clean up the mess of entitled kids like your son and that it\u2019s ok for him to be a ass to those who work minimum wage jobs. I think your son should be made to get a job in the service industry to see how much they put up with and learn some responsibility. Also would your wife not expect him to clean up after himself at home if he was sick? Or does she do it for him?", "NTA - It's degrading and insulting to have anyone else clean it up.

It's humiliating for your son but not the member of staff who would've had to clean it up?", "NTA\n\nYou need to have a converstion with your wife about her precious son, because no woman/partner/roommate is going to put up with his shit.\n\nShe's worried he was humiliated?

Too many people assume that service employees should have to put up with their crap (literally in this case) just because they\u2019re paid a meagre salary. And good parenting.
