Taking a crap in urinals has been this weird thing teenagers think is funny for a while now. \n\nYour wife can be furious all she wants- she wasn't the one who would have had to clean it up. If she has issues with you holding your son accountable for his wrong doings, then she will enable bad behavior and your son will continue to do this kind of crap.

The store manager who hired me would get hammered at the restaurant across the street at lunch every day, and would sometimes make creepy comments about/directed at young girls, and was generally an awful manager.\n\nThere was one time that a homeless woman (who had been coming into the store daily, to use the bathroom) left the bathroom floor covered in shit. My awful manager explained to her politely that she was not allowed to continue using the bathroom at our store, and he cleaned it up himself.\n\nHe was a truly awful manager, but I was really surprised to see him take responsibility and own the situation.\n\nAlso, I don't want to debate the ethics of this, but homeless people do deserve a clean place to use the bathroom and wash themselves, but a private business shouldn't be burdened with with wiping up diarrhea splatter from the floor and walls.", "Worked at a casino and people shitting themselves was a daily occurrence I shit you not.
