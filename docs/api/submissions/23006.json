For example, she rented an apartment from my parents and lived a year without paying rent. There have been other occasions of stealing money from me when I was younger or my parents. However, I felt that in recent years, she had changed also her (then) ex had taken her car out of spite when they split up leaving her no way to get to work and two kids to feed by herself. \n\nI spoke to my parents about lending her my car and they told me it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea and they didn\u2019t want to be put in the middle of it. I wanted to trust my sister and since we only agreed to $250/month plus insurance and maintaining the car I thought it was manageable for her. It was supposed to be mutually beneficial.\n\nWe ended up writing up an agreement and mentioned there would be an option for her to buy my car if everything went well and I chose to sell it upon my return.\n\nThe first few months, everything was on time, until I noticed she hadn\u2019t sent me anything. She said she sent the payment and when I checked she had only sent $50. She promised she had sent the full amount. Eventually she was consistently two months behind on payment. Then I found out that she had never paid for insurance, she made our mom pay for this promising she would pay her back. \n\nTwo months before returning to my country, I told my sister that our agreement wasn\u2019t working and that I would be taking my car back when I returned home due to her not paying insurance, several unpaid tickets that my mom had paid, her not being consistent with payments and also not maintaining the car. A fight ensued where she said I had been handed everything in life by my parents, and  I would be responsible for her losing her job and not being able to feed her children.\n\nShe tried manipulating me into keeping the car but I said I will be taking it back.

My dad had done the only maintenance on the car 6 months ago an my sister had not done anything since. The wheels were nearly smooth, no fuel in the tank, no coolant or wiper fluid and the car desperately needed an oil change. The car has significantly more miles since she drove a lot or uber. \n\nWe agreed to meet to talk and settle our argument but she has canceled twice.

Your sister is obviously an AH, but you have been warned *by your own parents* not to lend your sister the car, but you insisted on wanting to trust her. Now you want some internet strangers to tell you that you did good, well you didn't.", "NTA should have listened to your parents though", "Definitely NTA. It was a great move to draw up an agreement but unfortunately your sister did not live up to it. Sounds like your parents are still bailing her out indirectly with paying things toward your car. You might have to consider this one a life lesson that some people can\u2019t be saved from themselves. Not to mention the money you did get from your sister may not even cover the cost of depreciation of the vehicle based on mileage and poor maintenance with the possibility of increased repair costs and requirements of new tyres sooner.", "She seems to be extremely overwhelmed with her current life situation aswell as a pretty unreliable person in general.\n\nNTA and take the car back asap. Her not being able to feed her children is entirely on her. You gave her a chance, she blew it.", "NTA, I can get it that you hoped that she had changed. In this case it was a harsh lesson to you for the future not to lend anything to her. She should understand the connection about her actions and consequences.", "NTA your parents didn't tell you that they would be providing her financial support to smooth things over and it's their choice to do it, they can't blame you. Sounds like you learned a good lesson though.", "NTA\n\nBut I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get anything from this meeting. Other than a whole pile of frustration.\n\nIt\u2019s your car. It was always an option you\u2019d take it back for yourself, and it would be acceptable for you to do even if she *had* kept it in immaculate condition.", "NTA for taking back the car since that was the agreement  and it doesn't sound like she could buy it from you anyway. \n\nBut you and your car got treated exactly as everyone expected you would....including you if you are being honest with yourself.  So take the car, get it cleaned and serviced and that is the end of it.  You would be an ass if you yell, scream,  or demand anything more because you KNEW she would not be responsible with this car but you decided it was worth the risk to get some money for it instead of having it just sit at home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wouldn't meet with her cause she will just make you feel worse. I'd go very low contact to no contact with her. She's just out to get what she wants.", "Nta. You TRIED to help. You gave her the benefit of the doubt. She had time to save up for a down payment on a car. 250 seems like a car payment for me (because it is where I live lol) but maybe where you live it\u2019s not that much. She decided to disregard the agreement. Now you\u2019re out at a minimum 1k for needed fixes including new tires. Things she should have been taking care of.", "But seriously does anyone else find it funny that the sister\u2019s job is Uber and she doesn\u2019t own a car?!?!", "Cut your losses.  NTA \n\nWalk away.  You have the car, you won't get anything else from her.", "ESH. You know she doesn't pay. You know she's burned your parents. Your parents specifically said not to and they don't want to get in the middle of it. You did it anyway and Mom got stuck paying the insurance. \n\nI'd apologize to your mom. I have the distinct feeling she only paid the insurance because she was worried about what would happen if your sister crashed the car while you technically still owned it without any insurance.", "NTA, but don't go after her about the car just take fix and learn the lesson. She has shown the kind of person she is and your family. That some how makes her let's her think she has the right to take advantage. Your mother and father know and have learnt this about her and now I unfortunately it's your turn. You were charging her a bit just for renting the car.  I never asked by brother for a cent for vehicle use when living together and he used my car all the time. I would pay the extra for the insurance (in Australia him being male under 35 at the time adds alot) never asked about the maintenance. He would occasionally put fuel in but he wasn't in the best state and I chose to give him a brake instead", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake the car, cut your loses, and NEVER trust her again.", "The sister has no excuse. My car was totaled on a Friday and I had a new one by the time Monday work rolled around. No I'm not rich, but had paid attention to my credit score and wasn't a deadbeat", "NTA", "Your parents specifically said no and they don't want to get in the middle of it.", "The OP is wanting to see if they are wrong for not selling the car outright to her.
