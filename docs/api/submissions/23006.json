It was a great move to draw up an agreement but unfortunately your sister did not live up to it. Sounds like your parents are still bailing her out indirectly with paying things toward your car. You might have to consider this one a life lesson that some people can\u2019t be saved from themselves.

Her not being able to feed her children is entirely on her. You gave her a chance, she blew it.", "NTA, I can get it that you hoped that she had changed. In this case it was a harsh lesson to you for the future not to lend anything to her. She should understand the connection about her actions and consequences.", "NTA your parents didn't tell you that they would be providing her financial support to smooth things over and it's their choice to do it, they can't blame you.

So take the car, get it cleaned and serviced and that is the end of it.  You would be an ass if you yell, scream,  or demand anything more because you KNEW she would not be responsible with this car but you decided it was worth the risk to get some money for it instead of having it just sit at home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wouldn't meet with her cause she will just make you feel worse. I'd go very low contact to no contact with her. She's just out to get what she wants.", "Nta. You TRIED to help. You gave her the benefit of the doubt. She had time to save up for a down payment on a car. 250 seems like a car payment for me (because it is where I live lol) but maybe where you live it\u2019s not that much. She decided to disregard the agreement. Now you\u2019re out at a minimum 1k for needed fixes including new tires. Things she should have been taking care of.", "But seriously does anyone else find it funny that the sister\u2019s job is Uber and she doesn\u2019t own a car?!?!", "Cut your losses.  NTA \n\nWalk away.  You have the car, you won't get anything else from her.", "ESH. You know she doesn't pay. You know she's burned your parents. Your parents specifically said not to and they don't want to get in the middle of it. You did it anyway and Mom got stuck paying the insurance. \n\nI'd apologize to your mom. I have the distinct feeling she only paid the insurance because she was worried about what would happen if your sister crashed the car while you technically still owned it without any insurance.", "NTA, but don't go after her about the car just take fix and learn the lesson. She has shown the kind of person she is and your family. That some how makes her let's her think she has the right to take advantage. Your mother and father know and have learnt this about her and now I unfortunately it's your turn. You were charging her a bit just for renting the car.  I never asked by brother for a cent for vehicle use when living together and he used my car all the time. I would pay the extra for the insurance (in Australia him being male under 35 at the time adds alot) never asked about the maintenance.

That\u2019s nta on any level.", "You might want to read the very last sentence of the OP.", "NTA op, you just had an expensive lesson that you still can't trust your sister when it comes to money. If you have an extra key, repossesse the car yourself or pay someone to take the car for you.", "YTA. Not for taking your car back, but for letting her have it to begin with. You knew exactly what she had done in the past and your parents warned you it was gonna end in tears and you did it anyway. And you let  your parents get sucked into the middle of it when they told you to keep them out. You allowed your sister to start this fire by handing her the match. Now you get to deal with the consequences.", "NTA, you made a contract that she agreed to, she should\u2019ve stuck to it, also just cut ties with her, or just don\u2019t lend her anything", "NTA but you learned a good lesson. Deadbeats are always going to be deadbeats. Irresponsible people will always be irresponsible.\n\nIf you can afford it, take the car back and cut your losses but never lend her anything again.", "NTA but stop trying to reason with her and don't even consider lending anything again. for your own good", "OP should never have given her the car, especially after parents told her not too. OP knew what her sister was like.  As far as the sister goes, she created her own problems so now she can deal with it!!!!", "NTA, but it is a lesson learned. Expect to have hurt feelings and anything financial on the car just be a loss. Frankly, if she used it to drive for Uber without telling you she would and could not put tires or keep insurance on it, thats pretty reckless and it's doubtful you will see a penny of what's owed to you.", "NTA, but I'd just sell the car (Not to your sister) and cut your losses.  She took advantage of you, plain and simple, like she always has.  And you should, like somebody else posted, take your parents to lunch and apologize for not listening to them.  You all need to cut her loose and let her sink or swim on her own.  Tell her you won't let her and the kids starve, but other than that she's on her own.", "YTA\n\nI seem to be in the minority here. But why are you doing a rent to own system with a car? IMO, you should have either did her the car on a payment plan and left it up to her to be responsible with it or stayed out of it entirely.\n\nYou put the car in a situation where she had to take care of it up to your standards or lose the car which is weird. \n\nI 100% understand that your expectations on car maintenance were truly just about proper maintenance, but why was this necessary? Either you take the car back, fix it up and sell it because you don't need a car in that country or you sell it to her and let her figure out how to keep it in shape.", "NTA for taking it back.  Kinda of TA for agreeing to the arrangement with her in the first place knowing full well how she is (yeah you believed she changed but c'mon).  Small claims court might be an option if you're in the U.S.", "NTA, but you are a rube. If you can small claims it, do. Otherwise, give up, go no contact, and learn the lesson.", "NTA.  She's your sister & you wanted to help her out & you hoped she had changed.  You were being a good bro.  Your sis however is not being a good sis.  She didn't take care of the car, I mean basic maintenance should have been done while you were away.  She couldn't make the payments.

You knew your sister didn\u2019t respect financial agreements or other peoples belongings.", "NTA but that\u2019s your mum not your sister", "NTA, but learn from this.  \nMy way of handling these things is to ask myself if I can do it as a gift.  If I can't I refuse.  \nI have seen these situations get in between family/friends and things aren't worth your relationships with people.\nHaving said that you are the dumb ass.  There was no other way this was going to go with your sister's track record.\nEnabling grifters like this reinforces their grifting like your parents paying the insurance, maintenance, tickets, etc.  Tough love is sometimes necessary.\n\nEdit- added a word for clarity.", "NTA but you're not getting your money.", "I'll go with ESH because your parents warned you and you went ahead anyway.  Forget about getting another dime out of your sister and never enter any kind of financial or business arrangement with her in the future.\n\nConsider yourself damned lucky that your sister didn't have an accident while using the car for Uber, as standard car insurance doesn't cover use of a vehicle for work purposes.", "NTA. You wanted to believe in and help your sister.  Take back the car and sell it for junk if need be and if able, but another one. You've learned your lesson.", "ESH. What did you expect. Honestly.

You are not the ahole...but it's disappointing people never really change...", "NTA,   but you were a bit dumb.\n\nYour parents warned you.

Especially because she\u2019s having financial issues. She could be using that money for her kids (one hopes) instead of enriching you. \n\nSoft YTA.", "I feel bad for the kids getting raised in that situation.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "If you can afford it, take the car back and cut your losses but never lend her anything again.", "The fact that their parents don't want to get in the middle of it plus don't want to help her sister is any indication of how badly she could be treated if she continues to be used by her sister", "^ bot", "and? how does that pertain to the question?", "He's just asking the wrong question because he still has Stockholm syndrome. The root of his guilty conscious is that he's not selling her the car. He's framing it as something else because he feels bad, in reality their too issues are not the same and shouldn't be lumped together.\n\nHe still looks at it like he's put his sister in a situation, which he hasn't. She's a deadbeat and puts herself in her own situations.

Not sure why you think you wouldn't be TA unless you owed her some huge debt that giving her your car would make y'all square. Doesn't sound like it, given your sister hasn't brought it up in her manipulative retorts to you. \n\nAlso, excuse me, she used your car to Uber, while not paying insurance? Wouldn't that potentially put your insurance policy in bad standing if your insurance co found out about it? She did more than mistreat your car, she put you at risk for screwing you over with your auto insurance.\n\nI don't understand why you feel like this is even a dispute. The only thing I can think of is you are falling for your sister's guilt trip to make you question your own judgement.\n\nListen carefully: It's your car, y'all laid out terms that she failed to uphold. This is her failure, not yours. Take the car back, and stop questioning yourself! You're totally justified.\nAlso make the decision now. She's already voided yall's agreement.

Just give her the car and take out a huge loan for a new one? She's never going to buy it from you.\n\nYou aren't responsible for providing your sister with transportation, and it sounds like it's going to cost you more that she paid during your time abroad to get your car back in good running order.\n\nYou could have sold your car when you left. You provided her with transportation for months when you didn't have to. Consider that your good deed and take your car back.", "YTA for expecting your sister treat you better than everyone else. You should have seen this train wreck coming. You were warned and you witnessed your sister not following through on her financial obligations. She financially abuses the people who try to help her. So for you, lesson learned (I hope). \n\nThat said, being unable to keep up with bills does not mean she should have misused your car. Did you agree to her using it for uber? If you did, the miles are your fault. She had been putting fuel and wiper fluid in that car for her own use. To return it to you empty of these things was her saying, \"Screw you, brother\" That has nothing to do with someone's financial situation. If you can afford it, turn over the keys and transfer the car to her name. \n\nI hope you can get a newer car for yourself. You don't know how hard she drove this one. Good luck!", "NTA she as a history of bad behavior but you gave her a chance, you didn't hold the past over her and effectively gave her a fresh start. she signed off on a written agreement, and then failed to uphold her part of it in any way. \n\nTake back the car?

Keep the car or sell it for whatever you can get back from it.", "NTA, I think it's nice that you gave her a chance. But she messed up. I like to give people a lot of rope too, if they hang themselves with it, I cut my losses and move on. Only one chance is given.", "Even if you saw the mess and decided to sell it to her, she'd either not pay, or say it's not worth what you want because it's a mess. Even tho it's her mess.", "NTA, she is WAY too old to try to play this as preferential treatment for you, especially since your mom was paying things on her behalf and she STILL wasn't upholding the agreement she made with you. It's well past time for her to act her age and stop taking advantage of her family!", "NTA. You tried to do your sister a favour and she blew it. Don\u2019t bother trying again, because she certainly can\u2019t be trusted, but you weren\u2019t wrong to try.", "This is a weird one. \n\nYou are NTA, but you aren\u2019t being very kind to yourself. You put yourself in this situation- even after all the red flags and family telling you not to do it. \n\nYour parents are AH for still helping her and enabling her to screw you over- even after doing it to them repeatedly. \n\nSister is a  major AH because she\u2019s taking advantage of family because she knows she can get away with it. And she\u2019s not going to stop. She needs therapy and self reflection, and probably a good dose of major life changes- none of that is anything you can give her. \n\nThere honestly is nothing to say to her. Get your car back, and remember that any assistance provided from here needs to not be in anything that takes away from you. (Ex: she needs a ride to work, you can get her a bus pass- not a car.  If she needs food, you buy her groceries, you don\u2019t hand her your debit card)", "I do too.  But they are not OP's problem.", "An ah to himself, certainly"]}
