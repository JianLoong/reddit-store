To accommodate my wishes everyone agreed I would pay 100$ monthly and someone else would take my tasks. \n\nI was more than happy and agreed. Well, since that faithful day all I\u2019ve gotten is comments on how lazy I am, how they all have a bunch of kids to take care of and still manage, how the money I pay is not enough (the amount was proposed by them, not me). Last meeting they finally had enough apparently and told me they now wanted 400$ per month. I said no, tried to negotiate to 200$ but they refused. It got really nasty and childish from there on and one person in particular Alex (SAHM dad 31M) said \u201cmaybe if you stop bringing a new guy over every weekend you\u2019d have some time for yard work\u201d. \n\nI have ever brought over two guys (one of which was my brother crashing over for the night). I got really worked up and said I wasn\u2019t paying a dime more and wanted a professional company to handle this. \n\nWell, they read up on the laws surrounding our dilemma and found out that I have no legal obligation to maintain anything. I only have a legal obligation to pay if a company is hired (with over 50% of tenants agreeing that a company should be hired). They tried to talk me into going back to our arrangement (200$ now as I had asked) but I refused until Alex apologies sincerely for what he said.
