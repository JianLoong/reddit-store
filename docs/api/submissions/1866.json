There aren't any you could live with out as a compromise? You know she was manic and I understand you don't want to undo everything. But a a few plants aren't going to kill you or ruin your garden especially since you paid nothing. YTA. If you don't compromise knowing what you know now you're taking advantage of her mental state. Even if it is after the fact", "You\u2019re being quite unkind, so YTA. She likely isn\u2019t reciprocating your greetings because she feels embarrassed that you saw her in a vulnerable state, and hurt that you took something she cared about while she was vulnerable. \n\nHave you considered that you may be perceiving her behaviour as a slight because you feel badly about your decision? \n\nIf that is the case, it\u2019s really okay to just go over, say you\u2019re sorry and that you were wrong.

YTA, a massive one, for that last sentence. \n\nWhen people are in a manic episode, their judgement is compromised. Show some understanding and empathy. Bipolar is a severe mental illness, and decisions people make while in a manic phase can embarrass them and hugely impact their lives. She's embarrassed already, and they trusted you enough to disclose that she has bipolar, and you just went 'meh, not my problem. I got some cool plants out of it'.\n\nWhy don't you meet them halfway, and give some of the back, or if you're not able to do that, just show a little kindness and empathy?", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m dating someone with bipolar right now, and I\u2019ve seen just how hard mania is. Sometimes people come out of mania and realize that the decisions they made aren\u2019t like them at all, and they regret them.\n\nYour neighbor tore up her garden and regrets it, and her mental illness contributed to her decision. If you had an ounce of compassion, you would have dug up at least some of the plants when your neighbor asked for them back.

So maybe you could spend another weekend and help Amber with hers? Make a new friend and smooth things over.

Knowing what you now know, I wouldn\u2019t dig it all up that\u2019s ridiculous I hear ya, not even a question. However, moving forward the decent thing to do would be to maybe talk to them and offer to buy some plants and help them plant them. I mean, a little goes a long way no ? I say you are NTA up until this point but if you leave it as is you are heading over to being a huge AH. Help the lady with her garden man.", "NAH. She went through an episode and made a mistake. It happens, and unfortunately she has to live with the consequences of her actions, but she also doesn't have to be sociable with a neighbour who has profited from a low moment in her mental health. \n\nAlso she isn't being rude; she is embarrassed, she has lost something she clearly loved, she has experienced a major setback in her mental health, and she is probably dealing with the flatness/depression that often follows a manic episode. Being nice and bubbly to the neighbour who now gets to enjoy her plants is probably beyond her capacity right now, and you do sound like an asshole for not understanding that much.\n\nYou're under no obligation to return the plants but it'd be the compassionate, neighbourly thing to do.", "NTA as someone who struggles with bipolar depression I understand the regret of doing things while manic. While It sucks that she dug up her entire garden and offered to give it away.. those are her own actions.. nobody forced her to do that. She should really seek help for her condition to prevent things like this from happening in the future. She\u2019s probably embarrassed by the whole situation and isn\u2019t being rude to you. If anything you can talk to her & try to come to a resolution", "I agree with all the commenters saying you\u2019re the AH, because of the rudeness remark. I\u2019m bipolar and have done some truly idiotic and relationship ending things during manic episodes. The depression that always follows the manias are so much worse than my normal depressions because I know I did stupid shit and put myself and my family in awful, and frequently expensive, situations.\nBeing friendly will cost you nothing and will go miles towards mending the neighbor relationship.

I go thru manic episodes and guess what- my actions are still my own. I don't bother others to deal with it.\n\nIf strangers grabbed them she'd never get em back\n\nAlso plants can't just be ripped up, planted, ripped up, planted. They'll all die anyways.", "YTA", "Like others have said You're the asshole for thinking she's being rude for being upset over a mental health episode costing her something that was obviously very important to her. Yes she gave you the plants for free and yes you offered to pay but that was under a different circumstance. You were later informed the woman was experiencing a mental health episode that continues to effect her and instead of being a kind person you chose to blame her for something out of her control. Why would she want to play nice neighbors with you when you obviously aren't really a nice neighbor?", "This is a woman who is obviously suffering greatly and a husband who is trying to cope.   \n\n\nI'm a bit confused at how he didn't notice that she had removed all the plants and shrubs in the first place.   \n\n\nThe kind thing to do is to tell them you can't return the plants as they likely won't survive the repeated replantings. If there are a couple that are especially hardy against the replanting, then offer to return those. Write up a nice letter, include the cash that you offered twice and drop it in mailbox.   \n\n\nYou may have a legal right to the plants but it's not kind nor ethical to profit off the severe illness of another human being. Return what you can.", "NTA.\n\nWhat would she have done if you hadn't taken the plants in, and instead some random stranger had picked them up off the sidewalk like she had origionally stated?\n\nShe would be in the exact same spot.\n\nIf anything, this should show her and her husband that maybe her symptoms aren't under control and she needs to speak with her doctor. That's not your problem though, that's theirs.", "Offer to take her shopping and buy her some new plants.  Perhaps she could teach ypu about some of them.  Make an effort to have some understanding.", "Do you understand what bipolar is at all? How deep a manic state or depressive state can get? Even with medication and therapy sometimes it can go wrong.

Please don't be this petty over a garden.", "NTA it\u2019s not your place to fix her mental health. If you knew about it before this episode then fine you would be the asshole but you didn\u2019t. \n\nYou spent a whole weekend fixing your garden and they expect you to trash it because she feels foolish. What about your mental health. I hate when ppl with mental health use that as an excuse to mess with others mental health. \n\nLearn from this and just reject everything in the future or discuss with her husband first as he seems more responsible. \n\nAnd for ppl who say she took advantage she can only take advantage of something she was aware of stop using your trauma as an excuse to belittle ppl.", "YTA and you're really showing your lack of understanding of mental health issues. She wasn't in her right mind, it's horrible to keep things she loves that she's removed while her brain was malfunctioning. At the very least, give her favourites back, maybe she'll help move them back", "YTA and you know it.

She's embarrassed and hasn't said anything out of line.", "YTA. she can be rude to you all she wants, but that's not what she's doing. if you had a human amount of empathy you'd understand she's embarrassed and awkward and vulnerable, and possibly a little upset that you took advantage of her.\n\nthis could have been a nice little connective episode where you made new friends and brought solace to someone struggling. instead you just took advantage, and now shit's always gonna be awkward between you and them. cuz you both know you took advantage of a mentally ill person.", "INFO Is she legally competent? That makes all the difference here.", "NAH but seeing as you got a lovely garden for free at their expense you should at least buy them some plants and spend a weekend helping put them in. Have some compassion for your neighbor.", "YTA. She's ill! She didn't know what she was doing and didn't mean it and now on top of being bipolar she's probably also depressed for losing her lovely garden. You, your boyfriend, her and her husband could've removed the plants from your garden together and put them back in hers. It's not like they already rooted in place, it'll be fine.\n\nHow can you not see this?", "Holy crap YTA. \n\nA manic episode is NOTHING like depression. She quite literally was not in her right mind and made decisions that she NEVER would have made had she not been ill.\n\nYou said they completely ignored you but then the next sentence said the husband waved.  She didn\u2019t interact because, as her husband has already explicitly told you, she was deeply embarrassed by her actions during her manic episode. \n\nYou called her rude? For being fairly seriously mentally ill??\n\nYou are absolutely in the wrong here. The ONLY compromise that would be acceptable is for you to say that it was a lot of effort moving and planting all of the plants and you had no idea, obviously, that she was ill when it all happened so they can have the plants back but they\u2019ll need to come and dig them out themselves. At the very least offer again to pay for the plants - at the correct value it would be to replace them as is. Mature shrubs are EXPENSIVE so make sure you don\u2019t low ball them. \n\nThat would be the kind, neighbourly thing to do. Yes, it\u2019s a shitty situation for you but I think you\u2019re well into the territory of taking advantage of someone now that you know the full circumstances. You got hundreds, perhaps thousands in free plants and are now fully aware of the circumstances.", "ESH. OP, she's embarrassed as hell, not rude, that's it. \n\n\nThat said they shouldn't ask for the plants back. Plants can't handled being moved from place to place often, nor do you owe them the plants. She refused payment twice.\n\nThey now have to redo the garden. If you're good at gardening you can offer to help her setting up her garden.", "NTA. At least if you do your best to make some amends. You were willing to buy some plants so you should buy a nice gift certificate to the local garden center for your neighbor. Give it to the husband.\n\nPlants do not do well if they are dug up multiple times anyway. It puts them into shock.", "Absolutely this. Offer them money again and don\u2019t skimp on it.

And be fucking nice and understanding about it. \n\nYTA\n\nHaving a good relationship with your neighbour is worth it\u2019s weight in gold.", "I agree with this. She has a mental health problem, and did something really embarrassing and stupid as a result of that. You were lucky you came by when you did, then she gave you all her plants. I think it would have been decent to give at least some of the plants back to her.\n\nI think it's understanding she isnt greeting you as she did before this happened. She is sad about what she did, and seeing you probably reminds her of her actions. Also, she's probably embarrassed too, now you know about her mental health stuff. I think its not empatic of you to label that as rude.\n\nSoft YTA for that.", "Agreed!    I was fully onboard with OP until that \u201crude\u201d line.     \n\nYTA.

That's what a good neighbor and non asshole does. \n\nSure YTA", "That's not how that shit fucking works.  Medications and therapy help manage the symptoms. They don't make them go away, and they don't control them.  Speaking to the doctor might be helpful, but her being manic and ripping out her garden might ne her symptoms under control or on a manageable level. OP is being an ass because she is still expecting the same amount of interaction even though she knows the circumstances.  That is an asshole move.", "Neither you nor OP have enough info to judge the neighbor's treatment regimen or control. Even people who are careful about getting treatment and staying compliant with treatment sometimes can have issues. \n\nThat said, I do think OP crossed a line by judging the neighbor as rude instead of embarrassed and upset about the episode. Doesn't necessarily mean OP should return the plants or really do anything at all to help the neighbor if they don't want to. But, they don't need to also be mean about it.", "YTA. \nAs it was out to you before, you have taken advantage of a disabled person.", "No you don't get it at all. I have bipolar disorder and had manic episodes where I've been in inpatient and decision making just gets thrown out the window. \n\nHer \"rude\" response is clearly out of embarrassment and probably regret for what she did. I have spent so much time grieving over things that I have trashed while manic, for how I've acted. It's not fun. It takes therapy and lots of hard work.\n\nYou don't have to give the plants back, obviously; but can't you reach deep inside yourself and even offer to let them dig some of the plants out to go back? Not only would this show compassion and an awareness of mental illness and what it does (especially, as you say, because you have depression), but you could potentially form a wonderful neighborly bond. \n\nIt's all within your power to change this situation, pretty easily I might add. Your regret for losing the nice yard by giving back some nice plants is quite a bit different then the regret she is feeling due to actions her mania caused.\nYTA", "YTA\n\nGet over yourself. She\u2019s a mentally ill woman who is regretful for what happened and embarrassed. Way to make everything about you. \n\nAnd even if she WAS being rude? Still YTA.

All she wants to know is why you're jumping around her front lawn completely naked and drunk. She calls your BF to come get you so you get home safely.

They have to be planted and watered, and they don't live forever. Once you put them in a garden, they stay there until someone goes through the effort of rehoming them, or they wither up.

But I say as a gardener; there's no just *replacing* something in your garden which you've tended to, grown, cared for, and watched mature. So I'm very much owning that my perspective is informed by understanding the emotional attachment to those plants.\n\nPersonally, I would've let her take them back and asked her if she'd be willing to collaborate with me to fill in the spaces I'd made. Because she very clearly has the knowledge to share, and everyone would benefit in a meaningful way (subject to her willingness, of course).\n\nThe instant I found out that this was a manic episode I would've been out there with a spade. But this comes of knowing how devastating it is for her, after many, many years of experience with someone I love.

Sometimes the guilt and sorrow from the time before I accepted treatment are almost too much to bear. I struggle with questions like how much of my episodes were me as a person and how much was it my illness taking the reigns. I don't have an answer. Thing is, I don't make others deal with the results of my behavior, regardless if it was due to illness. I have lost friends, jobs, family heirlooms, and so much more but I never blamed anyone. Instead, I used it as a wake-up call to get treatment and better my life. Yeah, it would be nice to maybe give her some plants back but none of this is your fault.

My grandmother's bipolar had manic episodes and depressive episodes of such severity that she had to be institutionalized at least once, and tried to harm herself many more times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think OP should have to give the plants back.  I think offering money for the plants to the husband now that she knows the wife rejected it while not in sound mind would be the right thing to do.  If it were me, I'd probably offer to pool some of the plants, money, and experience together, as the wife is clearly a good gardener if her plants were such a catch, and they could turn it into a positive experience in general.", "I\u2019m no gardener, but my husband and I have slowly built up a little green space in our home over the years, and I love it so much. They aren\u2019t even expensive plants, but they add up. \n\nI am going to get my husband a new plant for his birthday, because he\u2019s gotten really into our little bits of gardening, and the one I\u2019m looking at is going to be \u00a340 when I factor in the plant and the pot. There\u2019s another one I really want for myself at some point, and that\u2019s \u00a3110 for a relatively starter plant. \n\nThat\u2019s a lot of money for us! The new plant (a specific type of prayer plant, if you\u2019re curious) will be his only birthday present, because \u00a340 is just so much money for us, especially at this time of year and Christmas just round the corner. \n\nI scour secondhand shops for cheap pots, because just new pots can get so expensive. I can\u2019t imagine what an entire garden like that would cost. Plants are so expensive, and most people on a budget - like me - have to build up our little spaces so slowly over the years. Having all my plants gone in one fell swoop would be devastating. It would take literal years to replace them and build it back up again.", "So when you hear a news report that says \"robbers have been taking peoples valuables\" the first thing that comes to your mind is \"oh no the ferns and cats that are being stolen\"?\n\nAnything *can* be valuable. To someone like a hoarder, functionally everything *is* valuable. Hell, some of the most valuable things in my life would be literally worthless to another person.\n\nBut the question here isn't \"what, if anything, might theoretically be valuable to anyone ever.\" \n\nThe question is, when you hear about someone taking the valuables from a person, what does your mind immediately think of? Do you think of jewelry, electronics, valuable memoribilia? Or do you think of a hydragea?", "See the problem is, we are taking the husband's word that his wife was having an episode. I get what you and others are sympathizing with here, but it honestly doesn't take that long to walk over to your neighbor's house to deal with the garden issue if that were the case.\n\nAlso...\n\n>Turns out she finally felt inspired to work on the new garden she\u2019s been planning for months. \n\nManic episodes are not things you plan for months in advance.", "and that's just the monetary value. if she got some plants or pots as gifts from loved ones that are no longer around, there's literally no replacing that. \n\nIt doesn't matter if you buy a thousand more, none of them make up for the sentimental value", "It doesn't matter if they're not valuables to a news reporter, it matters that they're valuables to her. And not because she has hoarding issues. If you don't agree that's worth anything, I think we have an irreconcilable difference of opinion.", "At this point uprooting the plants again may kill or damage them. If it were me I\u2019d offer money for new plants and offer to help replant the neighbor\u2019s garden if she is comfortable with that.  I might try to give back some of her favorites if they can be safely replanted again.", "Absolutely. It sounds silly perhaps, but I have a spider plant that someone gave me as a present for a pagan holiday I was hosting a dinner for and invited her to. I named her Miz Spider, after the James and the Giant Peach character, and she\u2019s flourished. She\u2019s grown so much and has had so many baby spider plants - she\u2019s single-handedly responsible for our green space almost doubling in size. \n\nI would be *gutted* if I lost her. Absolutely gutted. I have about 25 other spider plants from her now, but there would be no replacing *Miz Spider* herself, and I would be so sad.

What would have happened to the plants if they sat on the curb and OP didn\u2019t replant them? Would they have died? Then they would be lost anyway. I understand that the neighbor has a mental health complication, but I feel she should still carry the consequences of her mania. If she had splurged on shopping or donated all her clothes she still would have to accept the consequences. It\u2019s a lot of work planting in your yard. It\u2019s a big ask to ask someone to dig up their garden. I don\u2019t think OP was rude in declining, and I do think the gift card is very generous and kind. It\u2019s a sweet gesture to someone in trouble. The neighbor asking someone to do the backbreaking labor of tearing up their backyard AGAIN and then having a messed up back yard they have to fix because they trusted their neighbor\u2019s word originally is just too much. This sounds like it is a wake up call to the neighbor that her medication is not working. \n\nI\u2019m a little shocked that the husband came over and asked for the plants back in the first place.", "Agreed except the fact that if OP hadn't taken them, the neighbor was going to put them at the curb for a free for all. If that had happened, those plants would be gone and never seen again.", "That wouldn\u2019t be reasonable at all.  The neighbor is mad her yard looks like garbage now. If OP gave back the plants then their yard looks like shit under no fault of their own.  Too bad.  It isn\u2019t OPs responsibility to make up for their neighbors mental illness.", "Can you imagine being in this situation and having the husband come to your door and have the realization of what happened hit you. I'd feel so fucking terrible. \n\nShrubbery and plants can be expensive. And some are sentimental. We have plants grown/cloned from cuttings taken decades ago from my deceased grandparents houses. \n\nThe neighbor is probably devastated at the loss of what has been years of love and labor. Plus embarrassed. \n\nI'd want to work with her carefully moving certain things back when it was safe for the plant and possibly learn some great things along the way because she is obviously skilled. Plus a lot of that stuff can be cloned and the op can still get/give cuttings.\n\nI think this takes more than sorry here is a $100 gift card.\n\nETA: it's not the OPs responsibility to do this but exchanging back at least some of the plants would show a lot of good will as long as the neighbors would be willing to do the labor and leave the areas of the extracted plants looking nice.", "How did OP intentionally capitalize off her mental health, exactly? The only way for that to be possible is if OP knew she had mental health issues in the first place.", "For another manic story, I've cleaned glass so hard during an episode that I broke it and cut up my hands.....and carried on \"cleaning\". \n\nAt that point I hadn't slept for a long while cause I \"didn't need to sleep\".\n\nMania can be very terrifying and very dangerous.", "I hope OP is researching plants in addition to bipolar disorder.

They may not have deliberately taken advantage, but should have reacted with more compassion.", "when I seen people on manic crisis, like she described, it showed - they were talking faster, acting weird, you know something was not right. And well anyway now OP knows.", "Exactly. At most OP has to wait for grass to grow back where she dug up her yard to plant her neighbors shrubs.

As a person who personally deals with being bipolar on a daily basis - you perfectly worded how it feels to snap out of a manic episode and see what mess you've made.

The fuck are they going to buy for a hundred bucks? OP sucks massive eggs.", "Yep. And unfortunately it\u2019s not the first or the last time she\u2019s had to face something like this post-mania.\n\nPeople have mentioned both the embarrassment and the sadness, but one of the biggest symptoms of bipolar for me is that it\u2019s just *exhausting*.

If OP let herself get sucked in to another manic-episode-induced-adventure, then she would be TA.

Leaving uprooted plants with their roots exposed to the air is a good way to kill them in a very short time! To ensure that those ripped-out plants remained healthy enough to be rescued by someone else, the neighbor would have had to ensure that they were *at least* replanted in appropriate-sized pots and given the right amount of water for each plant. And even then she would have had to hope that someone else who wanted those plants AND could cart them home AND plant them promptly would come along very soon. The OP did nothing at all rude in taking the plants and taking care of them! Those plants were OFFERED to the OP - and since when is it wrong to accept a freely given offer?!\n\nLet's hope that this is a wake-up call for the neighbor. She needs to buckle down and get her bipolar disorder under as much control as possible before she makes *another* expensive error in judgment! This means working hard and honestly with her psychiatrist and therapist, taking her meds as scheduled (and NOT going off them every time she \"feels fine\") and, if those meds are causing unwanted side effects, reporting that promptly to the prescribing doctor as well.

That\u2019s cruel. You exploited her, and you knew you were doing it by how much you tried to pay her.

And you took advantage - plants you wanted to pay for previously you now refuse to hand back when asked politely and will good reason/acceptable explanation for why they want them back. \n\nYes, you sure did put in a lot of work. But you also lucked out on a lot of freebies. What would have been kind is to tell the husband she has nothing to be embarrassed about, as mental health is just like any other illness - something to be treated by drs and to be respected/reasonably accommodated by others. **That includes not taking advantage of people when they are in the middle of a mental breakdown**. Sure, you didn\u2019t know at the time - but when you found out, you decided you\u2019d rather continue taking advantage instead of being an understanding human being.

She's been discriminated against for it, her concerns and feelings not taken seriously, and her input devalued in both work, medical, and personal relationships.  Why would the husband take that risk for his wife if it wasn't the case?  That seems far more unlikely to me than him lying about her having an episode.  And again, it doesn't take long to deal with a garden issue, unless you are dealing with a health crisis.  Then seemingly small things take a backseat, because the effort to put into them is being funneled elsewhere.\n\nNo, manic episodes are not things planned months in advance.  But they can last a long time, and time can become a bit fuzzy with them.  Further, there's a difference in process.  If I'm planning on making changes to a room, I don't generally start by ripping out all the furniture, light fixtures, carpets and a few walls.  Large changes like that tend to be more gradual.

It may be that she put them on her porch and not the curb to begin with because she wasn\u2019t completely sure she wanted to get rid of them yet, and it was OP inquiring after seeing them on the porch that pushed her to actually get rid of them.\n\nI feel like the fact that the neighbor didn\u2019t get out then out for others and only gave them up after OP asked about them makes it even worse for OP.", "OP didn\u2019t \u201cdo this\u201d to the woman.

There are much better (and kinder) ways to resolve this. Even if OP doesn\u2019t have a lot of money to contribute/offer as compensation (totally reasonable) then they can at least empathize, maybe offer some of their own labor + what they can afford (or what they originally offered in the first place) to help the neighbors garden or offer to give back some of the most precious plants if the neighbors will help fix the holes left in OP\u2019s garden in return.", "Also, some things could be even more sentimental.

I was straight up terrified the entire time. \n\nAnyway. After he left I had to tell them that, no this isn't funny. He needs help now. And they still didn't understand. His BIL worked with us and I was trying to get him to contact his sister to clue her in. \n\nThen I saw the original guy later that day and he told me he didn't want to be doing what was doing but couldn't stop.

Nobody would really steal them, but they cost a lot to aquire. \n\nI do not think what specific things I I would hear about on a news report is relevant. For example, nobody would write a news report about someone stealing your family photos, but I expect you would be quite upset about them. Does that mean they're no longer valuables because nobody cared to write a story on them?", "It matters if it is on a news report because that suggests how language is used and understood, and how we should discuss it here.\n\nI am saying that there is a standard way of discussing \"the valuables\" of a person, such that it would be used that way on a news report. Comparatively, what you are mentioning WOULDNT be called \"the valuables\" of a person on a news report. It might be called \"a valuable plant\" or \"a beloved pet,\" but it wouldn't be called \"their valuables.\"\n\nAs such, it makes less sense to call a plant or a pet \"the valuables\" of a person, or to say that it is \"their valuables.\"\n\nIf you don't like this feature of the English language, that's fine. English is weird and dumb and illogical in lots of ways. But that is why it matters to be specific and precise. I am confident in saying that there is a meaningful difference between \"the valuables\" of a person, or discussing \"their valuables,\" as compared to discussing anything that is of value to them.", "Look, I don't particularly want to argue about semantics because that is irrelevant.

That's taking advantage of vulnerable person. \n\nHere's the thing, bipolar is on a whole other level than depression. I have bipolar and mania is scary AF if you're not on meds because you don't just get energetic, creative, or have sudden ideas. You hallucinate and have delusions which is why when you get a crazy idea you get so fixated on it even if it's something you normally would never do. You lose your impulse control so you act on your delusions and the hallucinations tend to reinforce the delusions. Episodes last anywhere from days to months long and then you switch into clinical depression on steroids.

Here's the [rates](https://www.hhs.gov/answers/mental-health-and-substance-abuse/does-depression-increase-risk-of-suicide/index.html) for clinical depression.
