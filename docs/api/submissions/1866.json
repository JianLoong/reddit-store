There aren't any you could live with out as a compromise? You know she was manic and I understand you don't want to undo everything. But a a few plants aren't going to kill you or ruin your garden especially since you paid nothing. YTA. If you don't compromise knowing what you know now you're taking advantage of her mental state. Even if it is after the fact", "You\u2019re being quite unkind, so YTA. She likely isn\u2019t reciprocating your greetings because she feels embarrassed that you saw her in a vulnerable state, and hurt that you took something she cared about while she was vulnerable. \n\nHave you considered that you may be perceiving her behaviour as a slight because you feel badly about your decision? \n\nIf that is the case, it\u2019s really okay to just go over, say you\u2019re sorry and that you were wrong.

YTA, a massive one, for that last sentence. \n\nWhen people are in a manic episode, their judgement is compromised. Show some understanding and empathy. Bipolar is a severe mental illness, and decisions people make while in a manic phase can embarrass them and hugely impact their lives. She's embarrassed already, and they trusted you enough to disclose that she has bipolar, and you just went 'meh, not my problem. I got some cool plants out of it'.\n\nWhy don't you meet them halfway, and give some of the back, or if you're not able to do that, just show a little kindness and empathy?", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m dating someone with bipolar right now, and I\u2019ve seen just how hard mania is. Sometimes people come out of mania and realize that the decisions they made aren\u2019t like them at all, and they regret them.\n\nYour neighbor tore up her garden and regrets it, and her mental illness contributed to her decision. If you had an ounce of compassion, you would have dug up at least some of the plants when your neighbor asked for them back.

So maybe you could spend another weekend and help Amber with hers? Make a new friend and smooth things over.

Knowing what you now know, I wouldn\u2019t dig it all up that\u2019s ridiculous I hear ya, not even a question. However, moving forward the decent thing to do would be to maybe talk to them and offer to buy some plants and help them plant them. I mean, a little goes a long way no ? I say you are NTA up until this point but if you leave it as is you are heading over to being a huge AH. Help the lady with her garden man.", "NAH. She went through an episode and made a mistake. It happens, and unfortunately she has to live with the consequences of her actions, but she also doesn't have to be sociable with a neighbour who has profited from a low moment in her mental health. \n\nAlso she isn't being rude; she is embarrassed, she has lost something she clearly loved, she has experienced a major setback in her mental health, and she is probably dealing with the flatness/depression that often follows a manic episode. Being nice and bubbly to the neighbour who now gets to enjoy her plants is probably beyond her capacity right now, and you do sound like an asshole for not understanding that much.\n\nYou're under no obligation to return the plants but it'd be the compassionate, neighbourly thing to do.", "NTA as someone who struggles with bipolar depression I understand the regret of doing things while manic. While It sucks that she dug up her entire garden and offered to give it away.. those are her own actions.. nobody forced her to do that. She should really seek help for her condition to prevent things like this from happening in the future. She\u2019s probably embarrassed by the whole situation and isn\u2019t being rude to you. If anything you can talk to her & try to come to a resolution", "I agree with all the commenters saying you\u2019re the AH, because of the rudeness remark. I\u2019m bipolar and have done some truly idiotic and relationship ending things during manic episodes. The depression that always follows the manias are so much worse than my normal depressions because I know I did stupid shit and put myself and my family in awful, and frequently expensive, situations.\nBeing friendly will cost you nothing and will go miles towards mending the neighbor relationship.

I go thru manic episodes and guess what- my actions are still my own. I don't bother others to deal with it.\n\nIf strangers grabbed them she'd never get em back\n\nAlso plants can't just be ripped up, planted, ripped up, planted. They'll all die anyways.", "YTA", "Like others have said You're the asshole for thinking she's being rude for being upset over a mental health episode costing her something that was obviously very important to her. Yes she gave you the plants for free and yes you offered to pay but that was under a different circumstance. You were later informed the woman was experiencing a mental health episode that continues to effect her and instead of being a kind person you chose to blame her for something out of her control. Why would she want to play nice neighbors with you when you obviously aren't really a nice neighbor?", "This is a woman who is obviously suffering greatly and a husband who is trying to cope.   \n\n\nI'm a bit confused at how he didn't notice that she had removed all the plants and shrubs in the first place.   \n\n\nThe kind thing to do is to tell them you can't return the plants as they likely won't survive the repeated replantings. If there are a couple that are especially hardy against the replanting, then offer to return those. Write up a nice letter, include the cash that you offered twice and drop it in mailbox.   \n\n\nYou may have a legal right to the plants but it's not kind nor ethical to profit off the severe illness of another human being. Return what you can.", "NTA.\n\nWhat would she have done if you hadn't taken the plants in, and instead some random stranger had picked them up off the sidewalk like she had origionally stated?\n\nShe would be in the exact same spot.\n\nIf anything, this should show her and her husband that maybe her symptoms aren't under control and she needs to speak with her doctor. That's not your problem though, that's theirs.", "Offer to take her shopping and buy her some new plants.  Perhaps she could teach ypu about some of them.  Make an effort to have some understanding.", "Do you understand what bipolar is at all? How deep a manic state or depressive state can get? Even with medication and therapy sometimes it can go wrong. With your last statement YTA. Your neighbor can't help her moods. Some people with bipolar can bottom out and end up in the hospital or dead. Please don't be this petty over a garden.", "NTA it\u2019s not your place to fix her mental health. If you knew about it before this episode then fine you would be the asshole but you didn\u2019t. \n\nYou spent a whole weekend fixing your garden and they expect you to trash it because she feels foolish. What about your mental health. I hate when ppl with mental health use that as an excuse to mess with others mental health. \n\nLearn from this and just reject everything in the future or discuss with her husband first as he seems more responsible. \n\nAnd for ppl who say she took advantage she can only take advantage of something she was aware of stop using your trauma as an excuse to belittle ppl.", "YTA and you're really showing your lack of understanding of mental health issues. She wasn't in her right mind, it's horrible to keep things she loves that she's removed while her brain was malfunctioning. At the very least, give her favourites back, maybe she'll help move them back", "YTA and you know it.

She's embarrassed and hasn't said anything out of line.", "YTA. she can be rude to you all she wants, but that's not what she's doing. if you had a human amount of empathy you'd understand she's embarrassed and awkward and vulnerable, and possibly a little upset that you took advantage of her.\n\nthis could have been a nice little connective episode where you made new friends and brought solace to someone struggling. instead you just took advantage, and now shit's always gonna be awkward between you and them. cuz you both know you took advantage of a mentally ill person.", "INFO Is she legally competent? That makes all the difference here.", "NAH but seeing as you got a lovely garden for free at their expense you should at least buy them some plants and spend a weekend helping put them in. Have some compassion for your neighbor.", "YTA. She's ill! She didn't know what she was doing and didn't mean it and now on top of being bipolar she's probably also depressed for losing her lovely garden. You, your boyfriend, her and her husband could've removed the plants from your garden together and put them back in hers. It's not like they already rooted in place, it'll be fine.\n\nHow can you not see this?", "Holy crap YTA. \n\nA manic episode is NOTHING like depression. She quite literally was not in her right mind and made decisions that she NEVER would have made had she not been ill.\n\nYou said they completely ignored you but then the next sentence said the husband waved.  She didn\u2019t interact because, as her husband has already explicitly told you, she was deeply embarrassed by her actions during her manic episode. \n\nYou called her rude? For being fairly seriously mentally ill??\n\nYou are absolutely in the wrong here. The ONLY compromise that would be acceptable is for you to say that it was a lot of effort moving and planting all of the plants and you had no idea, obviously, that she was ill when it all happened so they can have the plants back but they\u2019ll need to come and dig them out themselves. At the very least offer again to pay for the plants - at the correct value it would be to replace them as is. Mature shrubs are EXPENSIVE so make sure you don\u2019t low ball them. \n\nThat would be the kind, neighbourly thing to do. Yes, it\u2019s a shitty situation for you but I think you\u2019re well into the territory of taking advantage of someone now that you know the full circumstances. You got hundreds, perhaps thousands in free plants and are now fully aware of the circumstances.", "ESH. OP, she's embarrassed as hell, not rude, that's it. \n\n\nThat said they shouldn't ask for the plants back. Plants can't handled being moved from place to place often, nor do you owe them the plants. She refused payment twice.\n\nThey now have to redo the garden. If you're good at gardening you can offer to help her setting up her garden.", "NTA. At least if you do your best to make some amends. You were willing to buy some plants so you should buy a nice gift certificate to the local garden center for your neighbor. Give it to the husband.\n\nPlants do not do well if they are dug up multiple times anyway. It puts them into shock.", "Absolutely this. Offer them money again and don\u2019t skimp on it. Calculate in your head how much you would have had to pay for your new garden and offer that money again. And be fucking nice and understanding about it. \n\nYTA\n\nHaving a good relationship with your neighbour is worth it\u2019s weight in gold.", "I agree with this. She has a mental health problem, and did something really embarrassing and stupid as a result of that. You were lucky you came by when you did, then she gave you all her plants. I think it would have been decent to give at least some of the plants back to her.\n\nI think it's understanding she isnt greeting you as she did before this happened. She is sad about what she did, and seeing you probably reminds her of her actions. Also, she's probably embarrassed too, now you know about her mental health stuff. I think its not empatic of you to label that as rude.\n\nSoft YTA for that.", "Agreed!    I was fully onboard with OP until that \u201crude\u201d line.     \n\nYTA.

Apologize, tell them you don't want to dig up your garden but that you'd love to help and make Iced Tea.", "Why?", "Let's make this into a lesson for the mentally ill person. That's what a good neighbor and non asshole does. \n\nSure YTA", "That's not how that shit fucking works.  Medications and therapy help manage the symptoms. They don't make them go away, and they don't control them.  Speaking to the doctor might be helpful, but her being manic and ripping out her garden might ne her symptoms under control or on a manageable level. OP is being an ass because she is still expecting the same amount of interaction even though she knows the circumstances.  That is an asshole move.", "Neither you nor OP have enough info to judge the neighbor's treatment regimen or control. Even people who are careful about getting treatment and staying compliant with treatment sometimes can have issues. \n\nThat said, I do think OP crossed a line by judging the neighbor as rude instead of embarrassed and upset about the episode. Doesn't necessarily mean OP should return the plants or really do anything at all to help the neighbor if they don't want to. But, they don't need to also be mean about it.", "YTA. \nAs it was out to you before, you have taken advantage of a disabled person.", "No you don't get it at all. I have bipolar disorder and had manic episodes where I've been in inpatient and decision making just gets thrown out the window. \n\nHer \"rude\" response is clearly out of embarrassment and probably regret for what she did. I have spent so much time grieving over things that I have trashed while manic, for how I've acted. It's not fun. It takes therapy and lots of hard work.\n\nYou don't have to give the plants back, obviously; but can't you reach deep inside yourself and even offer to let them dig some of the plants out to go back? Not only would this show compassion and an awareness of mental illness and what it does (especially, as you say, because you have depression), but you could potentially form a wonderful neighborly bond. \n\nIt's all within your power to change this situation, pretty easily I might add. Your regret for losing the nice yard by giving back some nice plants is quite a bit different then the regret she is feeling due to actions her mania caused.\nYTA", "YTA\n\nGet over yourself. She\u2019s a mentally ill woman who is regretful for what happened and embarrassed. Way to make everything about you. \n\nAnd even if she WAS being rude? Still YTA.

You've taken advantage of her mental health.", "YTA. You apparently understand mental health issues but don't have the compassion to help her out? Offer to work with her to rebuild your gardens together", "YTA. The lack of empathy is astounding.", "YTA - This is such an obvious opportunity to show some kindness to a person who is clearly struggling and you\u2019re going the extra mile to be a jerk instead. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not my neighbor.", "YTA You\u2019re a colossal asshole \u201cI know you had a mental health crisis but check out my new garden!\u201d", "The thing is, helping people can be inconvenient but we do it anyway because it\u2019s the right thing to do. What\u2019s right here? Returning the plants. Is it going to be inconvenient? Yea, probably but it doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t do it. \n\nI would suggest reflecting on a time when friends, family or neighbours helped you in a time of crisis but there\u2019s something about your post that suggests people won\u2019t be so keen to help you.

The fact that she sees you now and then, and the couple of trying to put you on a guilt trip, doesn't really change the math for me.\n\nPlants are living things, they are not static objects. They have to be planted and watered, and they don't live forever. Once you put them in a garden, they stay there until someone goes through the effort of rehoming them, or they wither up. This is trickier than, say, if she had given you a lasagna, and asked for it back, but still not as simple as if she had given you a couch, and asked for it back. I'm basically feeling, in this scenario, what's done is done. \n\nEven if you gave her all the plants back, I don't think it's going to make it less awkward.

So I'm very much owning that my perspective is informed by understanding the emotional attachment to those plants.\n\nPersonally, I would've let her take them back and asked her if she'd be willing to collaborate with me to fill in the spaces I'd made. Because she very clearly has the knowledge to share, and everyone would benefit in a meaningful way (subject to her willingness, of course).\n\nThe instant I found out that this was a manic episode I would've been out there with a spade. But this comes of knowing how devastating it is for her, after many, many years of experience with someone I love. BPD isn't some minor depression, or something easily medicated into submission, and her losing her garden is such a massive setback.", "Yeah hard agree, not being *technically in the wrong* doesn't mean your behaviour isn't that of a shitgibbon.", "Another thing to note is that these aren\u2019t strangers OP is dealing with, they\u2019re her neighbors!  People she\u2019s going to have to live next to and presumably keep the peace with.  On top of taking advantage of her neighbor\u2019s mental health crisis, are these plants really worth harming OP\u2019s relationship with them?  \n\nThere is no compassion being shown here.", "For real. I\u2019d be so embarrassed I would insist on payment. God this would literally keep me up at night.", "What a great succinct and precise answer/explanation.  It also gives the option to show understanding with a possibility of reconciling the relationship if they choose to do so.", "I would have to disagree with you. In the beginning OP said she understood her struggle with mental health when the husband first came to her. But now that OP is being ignored by the wife, the wife is rude.\n\nOP is a hard YTA", "She claims to have depression, while ignoring how mental health can influence the things you do while having an episode.", "But she really wanted the plants. /s", "Because she didn't have a garden before the neighbour uprooted her own garden.  \n\nAnd we aren't talking about just some marigolds, there were actual shrubs she took.", "I too have someone close with me that has BPD so thank you for suggesting I educate myself. I have. Staying on top of physical and mental health is key. I wasn\u2019t suggesting medication was the only option, just generally saying that it can be used in a therapy session to get the right medication for that particular period of time. As you know, it is having to be constantly adjusted. At least for people with severe BPD. If not so severe, most can develop coping mechanisms to implement into their daily lives.", "Oh yes that makes sense and that\u2019s more reasonable. There was another comment below yours about someone who rehomed a pet due to grief - and that\u2019s more what I was referring to. \n\nI\u2019ve worked with a few shelters in the past and it\u2019s always really upsetting about the amount of pets that get returned cause their previous adopter no longer could take care of them. Now they make it more difficult to adopt in the first place to ensure that animals are going to homes that can properly care for them.", "theres a different between \u201cunderstanding some symptoms\u201d and \u201cfully understanding the complexities of an already complex psychiatric disorder\u201d\n\ni can say i understand sociopathy, but when actually faced with it im not sure id handle it well because i dont have real life experience with sociopaths. OP may understand some of the symptoms, but without that real world experience it\u2019s generally hard to understand just what mania entails and the aftermath of it. \n\nlike i said, most people know about manic impulsivity and recklessness, but not a lot of people understand the self isolation and self depreciation that follows, and most people dont know that their knowledge is lacking. so no, i dont think OPs lack of knowledge makes them an AH", "She was offered. She didn\u2019t take.", "All of those things you thought were rude? They were. But that person was a friend of yours, so you were emotionally invested in figuring out why your friend was rude, and in the interests of keeping the friendship that meant something to you, you accepted that they did rude things because of their mental issues and you forgave them. I hope those things aren\u2019t still happening. If they are, you might want to check in with your friend because they may need to adjust how they\u2019re dealing with their diagnosis. \n\nNot waving at your neighbor (whom you hardly know) after an embarrassing incident while you\u2019re in the middle of fixing that embarrassing incident isn\u2019t rude, exactly. It\u2019s avoidance, and it\u2019s understandable. (At least to me, but I\u2019m that neighbor who takes her trash out at 10 pm in the hopes no one sees her and tries to talk to her.) But it is a deviation from OP\u2019s normal interaction with her, and I wonder if OP said \u201crude\u201d for lack of a better word. \n\nI agree with your NAH ruling, but understanding that someone is acting a certain way because of a mental health issue doesn\u2019t automatically make their actions less rude. Especially for someone not emotionally invested in them. It explains them, but the individual still needs to take responsibility for their actions. \n\nI have ADHD. When my SIL texts me and I read it and mean to respond then never do, that\u2019s rude. And so I apologize.", "Maybe the husband works away from home and came back to the mess in his garden?", "yeah, i feel like a lot people conflate avoidance with being rude without realising that the two are different tbh, so yeah i agree. although, i disagree with my friends behaviour being rude. it was maybe inconsiderate, but not rude imo", "But she knows *now*.  If she gives back the plants, yes, she will be out time and money.  But even though she didn\u2019t *technically* do anything wrong, she\u2019s still capitalizing off someone suffering from a mental health condition.   Giving the plants back is the kinder, better thing to do.", "Then he should\u2019ve suggested planting a new garden once he saw that their neighbor had already planted all of those plants. Asking someone to dig up their lawn doesn\u2019t make sense.", "Maybe, there are a lot of likely scenarios, but the OP being an asshole and not offering to pay for the plants isn't one of them.", "That\u2019s fair. It\u2019s your friend, you\u2019re the one dealing with it. To me, it would be rude. I probably shouldn\u2019t have stated it as fact instead of opinion.", "oh no worries! i totally see how it can be seen as rude by others, but it was less rudeness and a lack of awareness because they had so much going on in their life. \n\nthe way i view it is like, if your house is on fire, youre not going to focus on the grass outside getting singed from the flames, youre going to focus on putting out the fire and saving the house. \n\nthey were homeless, dealing with drug addiction, and working a very physically and emotionally demanding job, while trying to figure out how to get an apartment and trying to stay alive essentially. im not going to be mad if my feelings get hurt in the process, because thats a lot to deal with in one go. it sucked, but i understand why they couldnt see past their own problems.", "Oh really, how so? It would have been more embarrassing, even rude, to assume this person replying to me was just an idiot."]}
