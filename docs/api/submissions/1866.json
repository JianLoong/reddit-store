There aren't any you could live with out as a compromise? You know she was manic and I understand you don't want to undo everything. But a a few plants aren't going to kill you or ruin your garden especially since you paid nothing. YTA. If you don't compromise knowing what you know now you're taking advantage of her mental state. Even if it is after the fact", "You\u2019re being quite unkind, so YTA. She likely isn\u2019t reciprocating your greetings because she feels embarrassed that you saw her in a vulnerable state, and hurt that you took something she cared about while she was vulnerable. \n\nHave you considered that you may be perceiving her behaviour as a slight because you feel badly about your decision? \n\nIf that is the case, it\u2019s really okay to just go over, say you\u2019re sorry and that you were wrong. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll appreciate it more than you know. \n\nNot to mention, you\u2019re missing out on an excellent opportunity to strengthen your friendship\u2014you could be swapping recommendations, visiting nurseries, working on your gardens together, etc. right now!", "Seriously? YTA, a massive one, for that last sentence. \n\nWhen people are in a manic episode, their judgement is compromised. Show some understanding and empathy. Bipolar is a severe mental illness, and decisions people make while in a manic phase can embarrass them and hugely impact their lives. She's embarrassed already, and they trusted you enough to disclose that she has bipolar, and you just went 'meh, not my problem. I got some cool plants out of it'.\n\nWhy don't you meet them halfway, and give some of the back, or if you're not able to do that, just show a little kindness and empathy?", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m dating someone with bipolar right now, and I\u2019ve seen just how hard mania is. Sometimes people come out of mania and realize that the decisions they made aren\u2019t like them at all, and they regret them.\n\nYour neighbor tore up her garden and regrets it, and her mental illness contributed to her decision. If you had an ounce of compassion, you would have dug up at least some of the plants when your neighbor asked for them back.

You also took all her plants!\n\nShe\u2019s not \u201cbeing rude to get what she wants,\u201d and the fact that you see yourself as a victim right now when you\u2019re withholding someone\u2019s property from then makes you TA.", "You spent a weekend and made your backyard look great. So maybe you could spend another weekend and help Amber with hers? Make a new friend and smooth things over. Right now, YTA because you made a point of offering when you could tell she wouldn\u2019t take the money, but once you found out it was a mistake, and some money would have been appreciated, you didn\u2019t offer to do anything to help.", "I must say this a conundrum, one of the trickiest I\u2019ve seen in a while. Knowing what you now know, I wouldn\u2019t dig it all up that\u2019s ridiculous I hear ya, not even a question. However, moving forward the decent thing to do would be to maybe talk to them and offer to buy some plants and help them plant them. I mean, a little goes a long way no ? I say you are NTA up until this point but if you leave it as is you are heading over to being a huge AH. Help the lady with her garden man.", "NAH. She went through an episode and made a mistake. It happens, and unfortunately she has to live with the consequences of her actions, but she also doesn't have to be sociable with a neighbour who has profited from a low moment in her mental health. \n\nAlso she isn't being rude; she is embarrassed, she has lost something she clearly loved, she has experienced a major setback in her mental health, and she is probably dealing with the flatness/depression that often follows a manic episode. Being nice and bubbly to the neighbour who now gets to enjoy her plants is probably beyond her capacity right now, and you do sound like an asshole for not understanding that much.\n\nYou're under no obligation to return the plants but it'd be the compassionate, neighbourly thing to do.", "NTA as someone who struggles with bipolar depression I understand the regret of doing things while manic. While It sucks that she dug up her entire garden and offered to give it away.. those are her own actions.. nobody forced her to do that. She should really seek help for her condition to prevent things like this from happening in the future. She\u2019s probably embarrassed by the whole situation and isn\u2019t being rude to you. If anything you can talk to her & try to come to a resolution", "I agree with all the commenters saying you\u2019re the AH, because of the rudeness remark. I\u2019m bipolar and have done some truly idiotic and relationship ending things during manic episodes. The depression that always follows the manias are so much worse than my normal depressions because I know I did stupid shit and put myself and my family in awful, and frequently expensive, situations.\nBeing friendly will cost you nothing and will go miles towards mending the neighbor relationship. Offering to help replant and even replacing some of the plants would be not only you being the bigger person here, but would help her overcome some of her embarrassment. \nWho knows, you could gain a friend from this .", "NTA. you offered something twice and she refused. if they want the plants back, they should be the one to offer to arrange your garden if they want it to be dug around.\n\ni get it she has episodes but it's not your duty to guess if she's having one everytime you have an interaction. it's more insensitive if you're going to assume that she isn't all up there that day.", "Nta\n\nYou were all clear and communicative. I go thru manic episodes and guess what- my actions are still my own. I don't bother others to deal with it.\n\nIf strangers grabbed them she'd never get em back\n\nAlso plants can't just be ripped up, planted, ripped up, planted. They'll all die anyways.", "YTA", "Like others have said You're the asshole for thinking she's being rude for being upset over a mental health episode costing her something that was obviously very important to her. Yes she gave you the plants for free and yes you offered to pay but that was under a different circumstance. You were later informed the woman was experiencing a mental health episode that continues to effect her and instead of being a kind person you chose to blame her for something out of her control. Why would she want to play nice neighbors with you when you obviously aren't really a nice neighbor?", "This is a woman who is obviously suffering greatly and a husband who is trying to cope.   \n\n\nI'm a bit confused at how he didn't notice that she had removed all the plants and shrubs in the first place.   \n\n\nThe kind thing to do is to tell them you can't return the plants as they likely won't survive the repeated replantings. If there are a couple that are especially hardy against the replanting, then offer to return those. Write up a nice letter, include the cash that you offered twice and drop it in mailbox.   \n\n\nYou may have a legal right to the plants but it's not kind nor ethical to profit off the severe illness of another human being. Return what you can.", "NTA.\n\nWhat would she have done if you hadn't taken the plants in, and instead some random stranger had picked them up off the sidewalk like she had origionally stated?\n\nShe would be in the exact same spot.\n\nIf anything, this should show her and her husband that maybe her symptoms aren't under control and she needs to speak with her doctor. That's not your problem though, that's theirs.", "Offer to take her shopping and buy her some new plants.  Perhaps she could teach ypu about some of them.  Make an effort to have some understanding.", "Do you understand what bipolar is at all? How deep a manic state or depressive state can get? Even with medication and therapy sometimes it can go wrong. With your last statement YTA. Your neighbor can't help her moods. Some people with bipolar can bottom out and end up in the hospital or dead. Please don't be this petty over a garden.", "NTA it\u2019s not your place to fix her mental health. If you knew about it before this episode then fine you would be the asshole but you didn\u2019t. \n\nYou spent a whole weekend fixing your garden and they expect you to trash it because she feels foolish. What about your mental health. I hate when ppl with mental health use that as an excuse to mess with others mental health. \n\nLearn from this and just reject everything in the future or discuss with her husband first as he seems more responsible. \n\nAnd for ppl who say she took advantage she can only take advantage of something she was aware of stop using your trauma as an excuse to belittle ppl.", "YTA and you're really showing your lack of understanding of mental health issues. She wasn't in her right mind, it's horrible to keep things she loves that she's removed while her brain was malfunctioning. At the very least, give her favourites back, maybe she'll help move them back", "YTA and you know it. The 'rude' bit is just you trying to make excuses for acting cheap, scummy, and selfish.", "OP, you literally had me until the LAST sentence:\n\n>I just don\u2019t want her to think she can be rude to me after her mistake then get what she wants. \n\nYTA for making this about you and trying to teach your neighbor a lesson. She's embarrassed and hasn't said anything out of line.", "YTA. she can be rude to you all she wants, but that's not what she's doing. if you had a human amount of empathy you'd understand she's embarrassed and awkward and vulnerable, and possibly a little upset that you took advantage of her.\n\nthis could have been a nice little connective episode where you made new friends and brought solace to someone struggling. instead you just took advantage, and now shit's always gonna be awkward between you and them. cuz you both know you took advantage of a mentally ill person.", "INFO Is she legally competent? That makes all the difference here.", "NAH but seeing as you got a lovely garden for free at their expense you should at least buy them some plants and spend a weekend helping put them in. Have some compassion for your neighbor.", "YTA. She's ill! She didn't know what she was doing and didn't mean it and now on top of being bipolar she's probably also depressed for losing her lovely garden. You, your boyfriend, her and her husband could've removed the plants from your garden together and put them back in hers. It's not like they already rooted in place, it'll be fine.\n\nHow can you not see this?", "Holy crap YTA. \n\nA manic episode is NOTHING like depression. She quite literally was not in her right mind and made decisions that she NEVER would have made had she not been ill.\n\nYou said they completely ignored you but then the next sentence said the husband waved.  She didn\u2019t interact because, as her husband has already explicitly told you, she was deeply embarrassed by her actions during her manic episode. \n\nYou called her rude? For being fairly seriously mentally ill??\n\nYou are absolutely in the wrong here. The ONLY compromise that would be acceptable is for you to say that it was a lot of effort moving and planting all of the plants and you had no idea, obviously, that she was ill when it all happened so they can have the plants back but they\u2019ll need to come and dig them out themselves. At the very least offer again to pay for the plants - at the correct value it would be to replace them as is. Mature shrubs are EXPENSIVE so make sure you don\u2019t low ball them. \n\nThat would be the kind, neighbourly thing to do. Yes, it\u2019s a shitty situation for you but I think you\u2019re well into the territory of taking advantage of someone now that you know the full circumstances. You got hundreds, perhaps thousands in free plants and are now fully aware of the circumstances.", "ESH. OP, she's embarrassed as hell, not rude, that's it. \n\n\nThat said they shouldn't ask for the plants back. Plants can't handled being moved from place to place often, nor do you owe them the plants. She refused payment twice.\n\nThey now have to redo the garden. If you're good at gardening you can offer to help her setting up her garden.", "NTA. At least if you do your best to make some amends. You were willing to buy some plants so you should buy a nice gift certificate to the local garden center for your neighbor. Give it to the husband.\n\nPlants do not do well if they are dug up multiple times anyway. It puts them into shock.", "Absolutely this. Offer them money again and don\u2019t skimp on it. Calculate in your head how much you would have had to pay for your new garden and offer that money again. And be fucking nice and understanding about it. \n\nYTA\n\nHaving a good relationship with your neighbour is worth it\u2019s weight in gold.", "I agree with this. She has a mental health problem, and did something really embarrassing and stupid as a result of that. You were lucky you came by when you did, then she gave you all her plants. I think it would have been decent to give at least some of the plants back to her.\n\nI think it's understanding she isnt greeting you as she did before this happened. She is sad about what she did, and seeing you probably reminds her of her actions. Also, she's probably embarrassed too, now you know about her mental health stuff. I think its not empatic of you to label that as rude.\n\nSoft YTA for that.", "Agreed!    I was fully onboard with OP until that \u201crude\u201d line.     \n\nYTA.   You should have *at least* let her and/or her husband come into your yard and dig up anything of hers that you had recently planted.     WTF?", "\"yeah they gave me an excessive amount of stuff and now that womans mental health is struggling even more to the point she's unable to communicate with me, but this should be a lesson that she can't be \"rude\" because she regretted, in a mental health episode, giving away all her stuff to someone who has no empathy for her mental health\"", "Thank you for putting my thoughts into much better words than I could!", "That was my thinking as well. Apologize, tell them you don't want to dig up your garden but that you'd love to help and make Iced Tea.", "Why?", "Let's make this into a lesson for the mentally ill person. That's what a good neighbor and non asshole does. \n\nSure YTA", "That's not how that shit fucking works.  Medications and therapy help manage the symptoms. They don't make them go away, and they don't control them.  Speaking to the doctor might be helpful, but her being manic and ripping out her garden might ne her symptoms under control or on a manageable level. OP is being an ass because she is still expecting the same amount of interaction even though she knows the circumstances.  That is an asshole move.", "Neither you nor OP have enough info to judge the neighbor's treatment regimen or control. Even people who are careful about getting treatment and staying compliant with treatment sometimes can have issues. \n\nThat said, I do think OP crossed a line by judging the neighbor as rude instead of embarrassed and upset about the episode. Doesn't necessarily mean OP should return the plants or really do anything at all to help the neighbor if they don't want to. But, they don't need to also be mean about it."]}
