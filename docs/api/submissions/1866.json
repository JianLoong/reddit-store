There aren't any you could live with out as a compromise? You know she was manic and I understand you don't want to undo everything. But a a few plants aren't going to kill you or ruin your garden especially since you paid nothing. YTA. If you don't compromise knowing what you know now you're taking advantage of her mental state. Even if it is after the fact", "You\u2019re being quite unkind, so YTA. She likely isn\u2019t reciprocating your greetings because she feels embarrassed that you saw her in a vulnerable state, and hurt that you took something she cared about while she was vulnerable. \n\nHave you considered that you may be perceiving her behaviour as a slight because you feel badly about your decision? \n\nIf that is the case, it\u2019s really okay to just go over, say you\u2019re sorry and that you were wrong.

YTA, a massive one, for that last sentence. \n\nWhen people are in a manic episode, their judgement is compromised. Show some understanding and empathy. Bipolar is a severe mental illness, and decisions people make while in a manic phase can embarrass them and hugely impact their lives. She's embarrassed already, and they trusted you enough to disclose that she has bipolar, and you just went 'meh, not my problem. I got some cool plants out of it'.\n\nWhy don't you meet them halfway, and give some of the back, or if you're not able to do that, just show a little kindness and empathy?", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m dating someone with bipolar right now, and I\u2019ve seen just how hard mania is. Sometimes people come out of mania and realize that the decisions they made aren\u2019t like them at all, and they regret them.\n\nYour neighbor tore up her garden and regrets it, and her mental illness contributed to her decision. If you had an ounce of compassion, you would have dug up at least some of the plants when your neighbor asked for them back.

So maybe you could spend another weekend and help Amber with hers? Make a new friend and smooth things over.

Knowing what you now know, I wouldn\u2019t dig it all up that\u2019s ridiculous I hear ya, not even a question. However, moving forward the decent thing to do would be to maybe talk to them and offer to buy some plants and help them plant them. I mean, a little goes a long way no ? I say you are NTA up until this point but if you leave it as is you are heading over to being a huge AH. Help the lady with her garden man.", "NAH. She went through an episode and made a mistake. It happens, and unfortunately she has to live with the consequences of her actions, but she also doesn't have to be sociable with a neighbour who has profited from a low moment in her mental health. \n\nAlso she isn't being rude; she is embarrassed, she has lost something she clearly loved, she has experienced a major setback in her mental health, and she is probably dealing with the flatness/depression that often follows a manic episode. Being nice and bubbly to the neighbour who now gets to enjoy her plants is probably beyond her capacity right now, and you do sound like an asshole for not understanding that much.\n\nYou're under no obligation to return the plants but it'd be the compassionate, neighbourly thing to do.", "NTA as someone who struggles with bipolar depression I understand the regret of doing things while manic. While It sucks that she dug up her entire garden and offered to give it away.. those are her own actions.. nobody forced her to do that. She should really seek help for her condition to prevent things like this from happening in the future. She\u2019s probably embarrassed by the whole situation and isn\u2019t being rude to you. If anything you can talk to her & try to come to a resolution", "I agree with all the commenters saying you\u2019re the AH, because of the rudeness remark. I\u2019m bipolar and have done some truly idiotic and relationship ending things during manic episodes. The depression that always follows the manias are so much worse than my normal depressions because I know I did stupid shit and put myself and my family in awful, and frequently expensive, situations.\nBeing friendly will cost you nothing and will go miles towards mending the neighbor relationship.

I go thru manic episodes and guess what- my actions are still my own. I don't bother others to deal with it.\n\nIf strangers grabbed them she'd never get em back\n\nAlso plants can't just be ripped up, planted, ripped up, planted. They'll all die anyways.", "YTA", "Like others have said You're the asshole for thinking she's being rude for being upset over a mental health episode costing her something that was obviously very important to her. Yes she gave you the plants for free and yes you offered to pay but that was under a different circumstance. You were later informed the woman was experiencing a mental health episode that continues to effect her and instead of being a kind person you chose to blame her for something out of her control. Why would she want to play nice neighbors with you when you obviously aren't really a nice neighbor?", "This is a woman who is obviously suffering greatly and a husband who is trying to cope.   \n\n\nI'm a bit confused at how he didn't notice that she had removed all the plants and shrubs in the first place.   \n\n\nThe kind thing to do is to tell them you can't return the plants as they likely won't survive the repeated replantings. If there are a couple that are especially hardy against the replanting, then offer to return those. Write up a nice letter, include the cash that you offered twice and drop it in mailbox.   \n\n\nYou may have a legal right to the plants but it's not kind nor ethical to profit off the severe illness of another human being. Return what you can.", "NTA.\n\nWhat would she have done if you hadn't taken the plants in, and instead some random stranger had picked them up off the sidewalk like she had origionally stated?\n\nShe would be in the exact same spot.\n\nIf anything, this should show her and her husband that maybe her symptoms aren't under control and she needs to speak with her doctor. That's not your problem though, that's theirs.", "Offer to take her shopping and buy her some new plants.  Perhaps she could teach ypu about some of them.  Make an effort to have some understanding.", "Do you understand what bipolar is at all? How deep a manic state or depressive state can get? Even with medication and therapy sometimes it can go wrong. With your last statement YTA. Your neighbor can't help her moods. Some people with bipolar can bottom out and end up in the hospital or dead. Please don't be this petty over a garden.", "NTA it\u2019s not your place to fix her mental health. If you knew about it before this episode then fine you would be the asshole but you didn\u2019t. \n\nYou spent a whole weekend fixing your garden and they expect you to trash it because she feels foolish. What about your mental health. I hate when ppl with mental health use that as an excuse to mess with others mental health. \n\nLearn from this and just reject everything in the future or discuss with her husband first as he seems more responsible. \n\nAnd for ppl who say she took advantage she can only take advantage of something she was aware of stop using your trauma as an excuse to belittle ppl.", "YTA and you're really showing your lack of understanding of mental health issues. She wasn't in her right mind, it's horrible to keep things she loves that she's removed while her brain was malfunctioning. At the very least, give her favourites back, maybe she'll help move them back", "YTA and you know it.

She's embarrassed and hasn't said anything out of line.", "YTA. she can be rude to you all she wants, but that's not what she's doing. if you had a human amount of empathy you'd understand she's embarrassed and awkward and vulnerable, and possibly a little upset that you took advantage of her.\n\nthis could have been a nice little connective episode where you made new friends and brought solace to someone struggling. instead you just took advantage, and now shit's always gonna be awkward between you and them. cuz you both know you took advantage of a mentally ill person.", "INFO Is she legally competent? That makes all the difference here.", "NAH but seeing as you got a lovely garden for free at their expense you should at least buy them some plants and spend a weekend helping put them in. Have some compassion for your neighbor.", "YTA. She's ill! She didn't know what she was doing and didn't mean it and now on top of being bipolar she's probably also depressed for losing her lovely garden. You, your boyfriend, her and her husband could've removed the plants from your garden together and put them back in hers. It's not like they already rooted in place, it'll be fine.\n\nHow can you not see this?", "Holy crap YTA. \n\nA manic episode is NOTHING like depression. She quite literally was not in her right mind and made decisions that she NEVER would have made had she not been ill.\n\nYou said they completely ignored you but then the next sentence said the husband waved.  She didn\u2019t interact because, as her husband has already explicitly told you, she was deeply embarrassed by her actions during her manic episode. \n\nYou called her rude? For being fairly seriously mentally ill??\n\nYou are absolutely in the wrong here. The ONLY compromise that would be acceptable is for you to say that it was a lot of effort moving and planting all of the plants and you had no idea, obviously, that she was ill when it all happened so they can have the plants back but they\u2019ll need to come and dig them out themselves. At the very least offer again to pay for the plants - at the correct value it would be to replace them as is. Mature shrubs are EXPENSIVE so make sure you don\u2019t low ball them. \n\nThat would be the kind, neighbourly thing to do. Yes, it\u2019s a shitty situation for you but I think you\u2019re well into the territory of taking advantage of someone now that you know the full circumstances. You got hundreds, perhaps thousands in free plants and are now fully aware of the circumstances.", "ESH. OP, she's embarrassed as hell, not rude, that's it. \n\n\nThat said they shouldn't ask for the plants back. Plants can't handled being moved from place to place often, nor do you owe them the plants. She refused payment twice.\n\nThey now have to redo the garden. If you're good at gardening you can offer to help her setting up her garden.", "NTA. At least if you do your best to make some amends. You were willing to buy some plants so you should buy a nice gift certificate to the local garden center for your neighbor. Give it to the husband.\n\nPlants do not do well if they are dug up multiple times anyway. It puts them into shock.", "Absolutely this. Offer them money again and don\u2019t skimp on it. Calculate in your head how much you would have had to pay for your new garden and offer that money again. And be fucking nice and understanding about it. \n\nYTA\n\nHaving a good relationship with your neighbour is worth it\u2019s weight in gold.", "I agree with this. She has a mental health problem, and did something really embarrassing and stupid as a result of that. You were lucky you came by when you did, then she gave you all her plants. I think it would have been decent to give at least some of the plants back to her.\n\nI think it's understanding she isnt greeting you as she did before this happened. She is sad about what she did, and seeing you probably reminds her of her actions. Also, she's probably embarrassed too, now you know about her mental health stuff. I think its not empatic of you to label that as rude.\n\nSoft YTA for that.", "Agreed!    I was fully onboard with OP until that \u201crude\u201d line.     \n\nYTA.

Apologize, tell them you don't want to dig up your garden but that you'd love to help and make Iced Tea.", "Why?", "Let's make this into a lesson for the mentally ill person. That's what a good neighbor and non asshole does. \n\nSure YTA", "That's not how that shit fucking works.  Medications and therapy help manage the symptoms. They don't make them go away, and they don't control them.  Speaking to the doctor might be helpful, but her being manic and ripping out her garden might ne her symptoms under control or on a manageable level. OP is being an ass because she is still expecting the same amount of interaction even though she knows the circumstances.  That is an asshole move.", "Neither you nor OP have enough info to judge the neighbor's treatment regimen or control. Even people who are careful about getting treatment and staying compliant with treatment sometimes can have issues. \n\nThat said, I do think OP crossed a line by judging the neighbor as rude instead of embarrassed and upset about the episode. Doesn't necessarily mean OP should return the plants or really do anything at all to help the neighbor if they don't want to. But, they don't need to also be mean about it.", "YTA. \nAs it was out to you before, you have taken advantage of a disabled person.", "No you don't get at all. I have bipolar disorder and had manic episodes where I've been in inpatient and decision making just gets thrown out the window. \n\nHer \"rude\" response is clearly out of embarrassment and probably regret for what she did. I have spent so much time grieving over things that I have trashed while manic, for how I've acted. It's not fun. It takes therapy and lots of hard work.\n\nYou don't have to give the plants back, obviously; but can't you reach deep inside yourself and even offer to let them dig some of the plants out to go back? Not only would this show compassion and an awareness of mental illness and what it does (especially, as you say, because you have depression), but you could potentially form a wonderful neighborly bond. \n\nIt's all within your power to change this situation, pretty easily I might add. Your regret for losing the nice yard by giving back some nice plants is quite a bit different then the regret she is feeling due to actions her mania caused.\nYTA", "YTA\n\nGet over yourself. She\u2019s a mentally ill woman who is regretful for what happened and embarrassed. Way to make everything about you. \n\nAnd even if she WAS being rude? Still YTA.

You've taken advantage of her mental health.", "YTA. You apparently understand mental health issues but don't have the compassion to help her out? Offer to work with her to rebuild your gardens together", "YTA. The lack of empathy is astounding.", "YTA - This is such an obvious opportunity to show some kindness to a person who is clearly struggling and you\u2019re going the extra mile to be a jerk instead. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not my neighbor.", "YTA You\u2019re a colossal asshole \u201cI know you had a mental health crisis but check out my new garden!\u201d", "The thing is, helping people can be inconvenient but we do it anyway because it\u2019s the right thing to do. What\u2019s right here? Returning the plants. Is it going to be inconvenient? Yea, probably but it doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t do it. \n\nI would suggest reflecting on a time when friends, family or neighbours helped you in a time of crisis but there\u2019s something about your post that suggests people won\u2019t be so keen to help you. So perhaps another way of looking at it is thinking about the consequences for you if you stand your ground. Word is going to get out in your neighbourhood and do you know who people work sympathise with? Hint: it ain\u2019t you! \n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t really need repeating but YTA for calling someone with serious mental health issues \u201crude\u201d.", "YTA. How does it feel to take advantage of someone with a mental illness during a crisis? You didn't even think of giving her back, half her plants, not even ONE. Nice enpathy going there. And you have the guts to get up on your high horse because she was \"rude\"? Have you seen yourself? You're told she had a manic episode and your answer is basically \"Too bad\".", "YTA. Give her back the plants OR give her the money it would cost to replace each one at the current size. Not the nursery baby plant size. The full grown size.\n\nIt\u2019s really gross for someone to take advantage of someone in a mental health crisis. Like wtf?!", "You're the asshole here, and quite a cruel one at that.\n\nI say this because you traded in your good standing with your neighbors for some plants and they're not going to forget that.\n\nNow whenever they see you, especially her, they're going to think of the time she had a manic episode and weren't able to recover the losses (of her plants).\n\nYou're also trying to punish Amber for her \"mistake\". Do you realize how awful a person must be to say that about someone who has a mental episode? Before, when you spoke to her, how did you not see the obvious signs she wasn't okay? I also highly doubt you got (what sounds like) several wheelbarrows full of plants planted before the episode ended. \n\nThis seems like you took advantage of the situation, after you were told about her manic episode. Either give her the plants back and patch up your yard or pay her the cost of rebuilding what you took.", "YTA. You could choose to be kind, and instead you accuse her of being rude. Why make this all about you?", "Really dont care about whatever comment the top comments are reffering to, you were already TA.\n\nYou're taking advantage of someones disorder. In other words, you're happily profiting off someones misfortune, at a a loss to them. You're worse than trashy TV producers, who just film the misfortune, and actually pay people for it.\n\nThat said, not wanting to dig it up yourself was fair, the appropriate course of action was to let them do the work themselves. You even probably could have still got some guilt free - free gardening out of all of this if you asked them to put back the impulse buying plants. And even if they didn't do that, the grass will grow back in a few weeks.", "YTA she's sick! Give her back her plants but do it slowly you don't have to dig them up in one day. Apologize.", "YTA it sounds like you want the plants and to be a good person so youre calling this woman rude to make yourself feel better. Calling her rude for having her husband politely ask you and not even get upset that you declined isnt rude....\n\nKeep your plants, they should be a constant reminder that you have some growing to do", "I\u2019m going with YTA because you say you understand what she\u2019s going through.\n\nJust because you can walk away from the situation doesn\u2019t mean you should.\n\nUnderstanding that she gave you the plants during a manic episode, how do you not feel that you inadvertently benefited from her misfortune? Because you did. Inadvertently.\n\nBut now that you know, how do you just ignore it?\n\nYou offered to pay for the plants. So go buy her the replacements. Yes, she\u2019ll still have to put in the effort to plant them, but won\u2019t you feel better about yourself?\n\nThink about these 2 things-\n\nIf you don\u2019t do anything, you may become a pariah in your new neighborhood. Maybe.\n\nIf you don\u2019t do anything, at the very least, the joy you feel with your new garden will be lessened and every time you look at it you\u2019ll feel just a little twinge of guilt. Definitely.", "YTA. Wow. The last line makes it clear you have zero understanding or sympathy for her situation. I have unipolar depression, like you presumably do. I thank my lucky stars that I have that and not bipolar depression, because it's much more complicated.", "NTA, this is a learning experience for your neighbor, she can learn better coping skills. Her mental health is not your responsibility but it is hers. If I was in her position I would feel like shit but realize you did nothing wrong and I only have myself to blame.", "Has the OP edited the post as I can't see the rude line everyone keeps talking about?", "YTA  - it\u2019s one thing to decide you want to keep the plants, sure, that\u2019s fine\u2026but a whole \u2018nother thing to expect this mentally ill and hurt woman to be chipper and giving you hugs right now. You\u2019re not an AH for keeping the plants, but it\u2019s mean, entitled, dramatic, self centering, and stigmatizing of mental illness to paint her as rude over this. You\u2019re allowed to keep the plants, sure, but she\u2019s allowed time and space to not be chill, hell, and even not like you anymore over it if that\u2019s how it goes. You got your garden, now lay in it idk", "You're upset they ignore you? Girl, you're lucky they don't spit at you when they see you coming.  \n\nYTA", "YTA.  Bipolar disorder is a serious disability and manic episodes are painful and dangerous.  Thank goodness it was just the garden.   It would be a kindness to not only return the plants but offer to help put the garden back together.  She was not in control of herself and by keeping the plants you're taking advantage of her disability.   She is not being rude, she is embarrassed and ashamed.  Be the person who responds with empathy and understanding.   It won't cost you more than some plants and a few hours of your time and it will go along way toward making her feel better about what happened.\n\nOr stand your ground and be the AH.  It's up to you.", "YTA. The poor woman is likely too heartrboken to even look your way as all she will see is her beautiful garden on your side of the fence. \n\nYour behaviour was opportunistic and a little immoral and now you expect them to be neighbourly. Pfffff", "YTA. You know YTA. Why ask here?", "YTA...    you come across like you have F'k you attitude.  You lose, I win and thats pretty crap tbh..\n\nI'd be handing back the plants or offering for them to do it  I wouldn't want the karma dump sat over my head for keeping them under the circumstances that I got them.", "Yta.", "YTA\n\nA bad and selfish person.", "YTA. You should have let her and her husband come into your yard and take the plants back if you didn\u2019t want to dig them up again.", "Yta omg give the woman her plants back..", "YTA and taking advantage of this woman\u2019s mental health episode. Give the plants back and go get your own.", "YTA, you could have at least offered to all work together and you keep some. \n\nYou've profitted from a condition she had no choice in having. And now you make her upset all about you? Shes not 'rude', she's heartbroken\n\nA friend gave away all his possessions because he was sui. Not a single person didnt give them back, not one. \n\nI wonder how well that TON of plants is going to fare now, surrounded by greed & selfish motivations rather than the love its come from", "YTA. Her husband explained. You are mean spirited- she never meant to do it. How can you even feel good about yourself?", "I understand your position, and I understand hers as well. What is the neighborly thing to do now, is to get your ass to her door and tell her you will go half. Tell her to pick whatever plants she loves the most, invite her to go shopping. You can have a new gardener buddy to share your love to plants with. Why throw that away? Why make it all about you? Soft YTA from me as well as you really can do more here.", "YTA. You did not know her mental state at the time, but you do now. I bet you could have come up with a compromise. Return some of the plants or at least let her collect her favorites. And it's ridiculous that you think the relationship would return to normal after you refused to give the plants back. \n\nPoor woman. That must be so awkward and sad for her.", "YTA. You got a garden of free plants and now you're here whining about her rudeness? What'd you expect, that she'd still be friendly towards you? I understand why you didn't want to return the plants but she is going through a difficult time and you're solely focused on yourself. You got your free plants, so quit whining.", "Soft YTA. My sister struggles with bipolar, and I can't imagine the pain she would feel if someone (even unknowingly) took advantage of her during a manic episode. When the mania is over there is embarrassment and hurt to deal with, not even going into the (often large) amounts of money needed to recover from such (spending sprees, redecorating/redesigning fees, etc etc). It sucks for everyone involved, and people with bipolar often sink into depression after the mania, especially if there's guilt involved. She's not being rude to you, she's embarrassed and hurt and now needing to spend a lot of money to fix her garden.", "Be wary OP, you are showing the world, including your boyfriend, what you are made of. You definitely need to do more here, whether that is giving a lot of the plants back or offering money again. If not then it really does look like you are taking advantage of someone\u2019s mental health difficulties.", "NAH. You offered to give her cash. Maybe you should offer that again, to help rebuild what she lost. Or buy her some similar plants to what she gifted you and leave them on her porch when she\u2019s out. The second one might be the better option, because like a couple other people have pointed out: she\u2019s not being rude. She\u2019s embarrassed and can\u2019t meet your eyes because -now you know- that she\u2019s bipolar and you will never look at her the same way again. That\u2019s what she\u2019s probably feeling. And to make such a huge mistake while manic and have to start all over again\u2026 it\u2019s got to be devastating. Almost as devastating as knowing your neighbor was there to see it happen.", "ESH, I know how much work it is so I'd offer them money to replace it. Or they can do it themselves and  buy you some replacements (and plant them). Her being mentally I'll is not your problem but it is nice to help then.", "NTA for taking your neighbors plants. You did not know that she struggled mentally and who knows if that is even true. You don't have to give them back and she doesn't have to wave at you either.  You should move on and enjoy your shrubbery.", "Be a good person and help her create a new garden... This is neither her or you being an AH... It is about you showing compassion for someones struggles", "You took it from No AH to YTA. An episode of mental illness isn't \"rude,\" she was literally not in a rational state of mind.\n\nGive them money for the plants so they can replant.", "See, i was with you until the end comment. Because had she left these plants on the sidewalk or thrown them out, they would be at the dump by now so she wouldn\u2019t be able to get them out. she probably doesn\u2019t want to talk to you because she\u2019s mad at herself for having a manic episode. and now, she potentially has to see your garden as a daily reminder that she had a manic episode and destroyed something she loved.", "NTA. I have diagnosed Bipolar 2. I\u2019ve done things like your neighbor did. I\u2019m in my \u201cfast forward unstable state\u201d (mania) and I give away something, I destroy something. And of course I\u2019m filled with regret afterwards. This would be a sign to me that I need to put more focus into my treatment and revisit the tools I have in my psychological arsenal to try and not just go BOOM. Dealing with mental illness isn\u2019t easy and it\u2019s bullshit but when things like this happen with me and other people , it isn\u2019t their fault, it\u2019s my own.", "NTA.\n\nThis is going to get down voted, but while I get this woman was having an episode, you are in no way responsible for her actions during that episode. Bipolar might explain why she did what she did, and you can have empathy for her, but everyone here telling you you're an awful person is so off base. You were minding your own business! Her mental health struggles are 100% not your responsibility! Bipolar is a challenging and awful struggle, but you in no way took advantage of this woman. Especially because of the labor you put in to plant all the plants in your yard. If it was like porch furniture, obviously it'd be easy to just give it back, but all of these plants are now planted squarely in your yard.\n\nThis is 100% not your responsibility and I'm disgusted by the comments implying you lack empathy when you were 1) unwittingly put into this situation, 2) not at all responsible for the management of her mental health, and 3) offered cash multiple times and clearly did not take advantage of this person.\n\nEverywhere else on reddit, people say that you're not responsible for the mental health of others and I'm floored by the responses here that go against that convention. It's on the neighbor to manage her mental health, you're all making it OP's problem.", "I support this. At the very least, op, offer cash, let her take her favorites, and offer cuttings of the rest (that can support something like that). I think that\u2019s more than fair. And throw in more pastries on top of that.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a soft YTA it\u2019s a hard one. \nSay if someone with dementia gave away all their valuables while having a bad day, whilst technically you can say they don\u2019t legally have to give them back but they still took advantage of someone who is vulnerable.\nI think that applies here, you may not have known at the time she has bipolar but you do now and are upset at the idea of showing someone compassion as it would be them \u201cgetting their own way\u201d.", "Yep, the op is an AH here. Why not offer the husband money for new plants or give half the plants back? It seems to be all about the OP and me, me, me. Then she wonders why these people blank her.", "I think there\u2019s still potential to recover a garden ally (might be slow going) if OP acts soon. Collaboration on each other\u2019s gardens with the generosity to return the most precious of her original collection could do wonders for building a new relationship.", "While I understand OP not wanting to dig out their garden again since they already put a lot of work into it and it would require another huge amount of work to fix that now, I am surprised OP didn't offer some compromise like e.g. digging up few of the most cherished ones and perhaps discussing with the neighbor what she would actually like and buying some new plants for her? I get it that OP shouldn't pay for a mental episode of her neighbor, but there should be some empathy from OP's side and they could at least try to reach a compromise?", "THIS! Seriously, OP?!? YTA, hard-hearted and selfish. Obviously, you\u2019ve never made a mistake or done anything that you wish you could take back /s.", "Not only could OP not be bothered to show any compassion, she then felt the need to try to teach her mentally ill neighbor a lesson. OP, I think you got something you really wanted from a vulnerable person and now you\u2019re doubling down. Allow her to take back some of her plants (she and her husband can do the transplanting) and go buy her some others - find a compromise. Life doesn\u2019t have to be about \u2018I\u2019m technically in the right\u2019 so I can do what I want - show some grace and be compassionate and kind. Honestly, your cosmic juju will be far better off with an act of kindness rather than knowing you\u2019re now willingly contributing to this woman\u2019s mental health struggle. YTA.", "If someone had done this to my grandpa who had dementia I would be so upset. I can\u2019t believe how heartless OP is for this.", "Exactly. Knowing how much work it is to have a decent garden, I agree with OP to not want to rip stuff out again. However, since OP already offered to pay her neighbor for the plants, it would only make sense to me to discuss with the neighbors which plants she would like to get there and buy those for her (and perhaps help with planting some to show some empathy and build a nice neighborly relationship). If there was one or two which were super important for the neighbor, I would dig those up and give those back too. Definitely not all, considering how much work was already put into that, but the ones close to her neighbor's heart? Yeah, why not.\n\nAlso, agree with other commenting people that the neighbor lady is not rude, she is embarassed. It must be super difficult for her.\n\nPeople tend to forget that having a great neighbor is jackpot and not that common.", "I hope you're feeling well and are stable.  My daughter has bipolar disorder and it's horrible.  We're going through a medication adjustment and I have hope that she'll be stable by the holidays.  I feel so bad for this neighbor.  A little sympathy and understanding would go a long way but OP doesn't seem to get that.", "I was looking for this comment. I can't believe she was comparing having depression to being bipolar. Blows my mind she even thinks it's in the same category.", "depending on what the plants are, money to replace may be a better option, some plants are arsey and 2 replantings may be risky. so a combo of giving some back and some $ may be best \n\nsome might be able to be propagated by cuttings which could also work\n\npoor neighbour", "It's the very last line, before \"AITA?\"", "You can often split smaller plants. They look skimpy until they fill back in but you and her could work TOGETHER to rebuild both gardens with a combo of your money and splitting some plants. Ask for her help  to since she obviously had some know how. Yeah, a good relationship with a neighbor IS worth its weight in gold. After all, they will be around when you are on vacation!", "Why OP, who has done nothing wrong, should allow them to come and destroy her garden, undoing all the work she did over the weekend? As a compromise OP may offer to help her neighbour build a new garden, but plants should be purchased by them as it was *their* mistake.", "You can be technically correct and still a cold and heartless asshole, like OP.", "This is the correct take.   Bipolar mania means the neighbor was literally out of her mind and not in control.  Taking advantage of that is a shitty thing to do."]}
