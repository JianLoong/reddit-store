Your roommate is a huge AH", "NTA - I would have called the landlord. Y'all are way nicer than I am and obviously have way more compassion. But for real, call the landlord anyways and report that. the \"friend\" could easily become a squatter. Also, double check and make sure nothing was stolen. If anything is missing file a police report.", "You\u2019re not crazy, this was highly inappropriate and her making herself right @ home using your stuff and eating your food is disgusting.

Most Apartments/houses that rent have a specific clause in the lease that says you can only have a house guest for X amount of days AND you must be at the property with them.
