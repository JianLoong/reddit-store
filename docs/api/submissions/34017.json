Your roommate is a huge AH", "NTA - I would have called the landlord. Y'all are way nicer than I am and obviously have way more compassion. But for real, call the landlord anyways and report that. the \"friend\" could easily become a squatter. Also, double check and make sure nothing was stolen. If anything is missing file a police report.", "You\u2019re not crazy, this was highly inappropriate and her making herself right @ home using your stuff and eating your food is disgusting. Sounds like you & your other roommate should find somewhere new to live since she literally gave 2 shits about your safety, not to mention, she was conveniently gone on holiday during her stay.", "You are NTA and you're not crazy. Guests have to be mutually agreed on by all the roommates, and guests don't get to eat the other roommates' food or use their belongings.\n\nCan you throw Bad Roommate out? She has probably violated the terms of your lease on top of everything else.", "NTA\n\nKeep ALL the evidence you have in case you find out there\u2019s anything damaged or missing later on and I\u2019d be asking this woman to leave\n\nShe can\u2019t just move random people in and out like a B&B and expect all of you to be ok with that", "So I am pretty ignorant on such matters but aren't renters generally allowed to have house guests?", "I think jumping to the idea that they were put in danger because they had a guest who is homeless without more information not included is excessive. The guest was rude and didn't respect boundaries and the housemate was mad disrespectful.\n\nSerious problems but No one's safety was likely in danger.", "Yes, but the other person usually has to be there. If you call the cops over a guest, they can stay as long as someone there says they have permission.", "YES - BUT - only if they are the only one renting it. Most Apartments/houses that rent have a specific clause in the lease that says you can only have a house guest for X amount of days AND you must be at the property with them. The fact the other 2 roommates didn't agree is a big part.", "Intersting.", "NTA but a better person than me. I would have went in her room and taken something of value and hid it.  Bet her compassion would fly out the window", "Info: You said that this made you feel uncomfortable in your home, which means you were home when this happened. Why didn't you just kick her out when the roommate left town? Why did YOU allow her to stay, make a mess, and use all of your stuff?", "NTA.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you two kick this stranger out?", "NTA but there were two of you there, you could have just kicked her out yourself. If she stayed after being asked to leave, you could get the police involved. It would be the absent roommate's fault if it had to go that way.", "NTA. I couldn\u2019t give a fuck if they\u2019re homeless or own a mansion in another state, if I don\u2019t know you, you can\u2019t stay in my house.", "NTA. You don't have guests over if your roommates don't agree, and it's wild to do it if on top of her not even being home to play host. If the roommate really had compassion why didn't they take their homeless friend on vacation with them instead of leaving her with you?", "NTA but next time, you and the other roomate tell her to leave. You don't need permission to kick someone out of your space and she should not be leaving guests around unsupervised.", "NTA This is charity without the inconvenience from your roommate, hence the gaslighting. \n\nThey are well aware what they did was inappropriate, so they make this about you not being charitable not just to the original intendee but them too.\n\nYou have done nothing wrong, I hope you are able to relax \ud83d\ude4f", "NTA. As soon as your roommate left so should her guest have left. You should charge her more for rent for next month to offset her guest. Call it an AH tax because that's what she was being.", "You are super dramatic! Yes it's annoying if a co-tenant is rude. But quick call the landlord/police is way over the top.", "Usually, this is covered in the lease. Also, a lot of places the \"guest\" has to be out after a couple of days and then a background check done on them if they want to stay for, let's say, a week. Plus, the renter has to be there."]}
