The reason why Asher feels less than is because you\u2019ve been treating his adoption like a dirty little secret instead of showing him beauty behind his story. The only thing you\u2019re teaching Landon is that you should conceal the truth and adoption is something to be ashamed of.", "YTA\u2014 your son told the truth. Asher is technically his adopted brother/bio cousin.. \n\nYou can absolutely say that Asher is your son, legally he is. But why lie and say they are twins? \nI\u2019m a twin so as much as you think they are twins, they are not, they happen to be biological cousins who share the same birthday and share parents due to adoption.", "YTA. \n\nUltimately, you're closer to the situation and Reddit can only read so far into it, but I think you've been making a mountain out of a molehill.\n\nLandon doesn't see what the big deal with other people knowing because it likely does not change how he views Asher. Asher is his brother, end of story.\n\nBut by hiding Asher's parentage and making it this big dog and pony show that him and Landon are twins to the outside world you're actually reinforcing that this is something to be hidden and somehow \"wrong\". You're speaking out of both sides of your mouth and that's going to be incredible complicated and difficult for 11 year olds to understand. \n\nLandon needs to be told that Asher's adoption is *his* history to disclose if he feels comfortable, but Asher also needs to be told that regardless of who is biological parents are, *you* are his dad, *your ex* is his mum and *Landon* is his brother. Family is the one you build, not always the one you're born to and he will always have a place with you.", "YTA.

It seems more than reasonable to explain to Landon and Asher why you would prefer that it not be something that is necessarily openly discussed at Asher's school without Asher's permission. However, Landon should have the right to tell his life story in a way that is true to him, especially if he does so respectfully. \n\nI would explore more with Landon what led him to make this comment, especially in relation to queries about your parenting strictness.
