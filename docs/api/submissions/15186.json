About a month ago my daughters started saying how hard it's going to be going to school on the anniversary of their mom\u2019s passing. I told them as long as they have nothing major going on like a test or big assignment due they can miss school and be able to grieve at home and take a mental health day. \n\nWell, it was all planned for them to stay home today until 2 nights ago a few of their friends were over and their friends were talking about how they are not looking forward to the AP chem exam on Wednesday. I looked at my calendar and realized that was the 19th. I told the girls after their friends left since they have the chem exam they can't miss school and ill let them miss it on Thursday. The girls tried explaining it was no big deal and that they can make it up after school. I told them I prefer if they don't miss if they have something major going on. I made them go to school today and they didn't talk to me all morning. I called my brother about it and he called me an AH because it has been only a year since their mom passed, So AITA?\n\nEdit: I can't believe how mean people can be... People are accusing me of not grieving my wifes death which I am just because I'm not going on about how much I miss my wife on a Reddit post doesn't mean I don't miss her I do a lot it has been a very hard and difficult year without her \n\nI'm navigating single parenting on my own I was just trying to do what I thought would be right for my daughters it's not the actual ap exam but they do exams every once in a while to get ready for the actual exam so they are important just to get an idea of what the actual exam is like \n\nI think im just going to get them out of school they haven't taken the exam yet...", "created_utc": 1681915505, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rvlsd/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughters_miss_school_on/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A grown adult. Mother of three. I had such a major breakdown over a bowl not going in the dishwasher the way I wanted it to so badly that I needed to call my husband to come home from work. I was breaking down over any and everything. \n\nYour girls are only 16. They just lost their mom a year ago. You could have called the school and told them the situation. The test could've been made up. How in the world do you think they're gonna be able to concentrate on the test when they're dealing with what they are? \n\nYTA", "An involved parent would call the school explain and try to reschedule the test instead if just saying go to school to greive and also be stressed on that same day.\n\nYTA", "Don't be surprised when their grades come in and they both did badly because they were thinking about their mom. YTA", "YTA. I am a HS teacher, your daughters can make up the exam. It's not always possible to take an AP exam early, but making it up, is absolutely possible. \n\nHow well do you think your daughters performed on this exam since it was the anniversary of their mother's death? So many factors impact students' scores like eating a nutritious breakfast, getting a good night sleep, their mental health, etc. OP, you just set your daughters up to perform not at their best ability due to them being more focused about their mother, then about the exam. \n\nWith AP exams, there is no such thing as a redo unless they pay for it again and take it next time it is offered. So the score they get is not going to be reflective of your daughter's true ability. Which colleges usually do not accept anything less than a 5, some will accept a 4, but that isn't very common.", "Not crazy about saying this to a widower but YTA. Missing a single day on the anniversary of a parent\u2019s death that occurred so early in their lives sounds quite reasonable. They clearly and proactively communicated their desire to do so, and it sounds like they had also made arrangements to make up any missed work, here the exam. \n\nYou may very well *prefer* that they don\u2019t miss anything major, but it\u2019s not surprising that you completely giving your own preference priority over their feelings about something so emotional was quite hurtful to them. \n\nOf course not every reaction to grief can be practically accommodated. If the time off were excessive, the thing they were missing was critical and truly not able to be made up, or they didn\u2019t have any regard for arranging a make up exam etc, those scenarios might require pushback. But here, their plans for grieving and observing their mother\u2019s death were eminently reasonable.", "YTA. Did you think they'd just go and take the test like normal, with no effect on their ability to concentrate? \n\nEven if the test couldn't be rescheduled or made up (doubtful), a single high school exam under the circumstances in the grand scheme of things isn't that important.", "Sorry for your loss but YTA, they wouldn\u2019t have been any less in need of the day off even if they had something going on at school. It doesn\u2019t sound like missing that test would have been disastrous for them anyway.", "YTA. Your kids are 16 and are still heavily grieving. Their minds and emotions will not allow them to focus on any of the tests/activities that will happen that day. Call the school and explain, get an alternate date for the test for them. And then all of you should spend the day together doing something in remembrance of her.", "I see your point but YTA. You could have called the school, explained the situation and had them take the test earlier or later.", "YTA - it\u2019s the first anniversary of their mother\u2019s death. Come on.", "YTA. A teenager losing their mother is one of the worst things that could happen to them at that age. Just as they\u2019re coming into their own, the person who has provided them guidance, love, security, stability, etc. is suddenly gone. Forever.\n\nIn no world is a chemistry test more important than giving your daughters the proper space to grieve the loss of their mother.\n\nMan, you\u2019re coming across as heartless OP. I hope you apologize to them immediately. Grief is a hard territory to navigate no doubt, but you missed the mark big time on this one.", "YTA\n\nYou all had advanced notice - they could coordinate to take the exam another date.", "YTA. That day is hard on them and you were willing to let them have it easier until you learned there was an exam? Do you think they will have the focus to do an exam and do it well? They will either fail or have a lower grade than what they could have done and it would be on you. \n\nThe day was going to be hard even without the exam. You agreed to make them stay at home in that case. With exam it was going to be even harder - now suddenly they have to suffer through it. Definitely, YTA.", "YTA.  It is the first anniversary of their mother\u2019s death, of course it is a highly emotional day for them.  You really think the right answer was to demand they go to school so they don\u2019t miss a test that they probably aren\u2019t in a good frame of mind to take and that could do real damage to their transcripts rather than letting them take the day off and make up the test afterward?", "YTA. As a teacher I wouldn\u2019t give them the test. Why? They will most likely do poorly on the exam. Even if it was the actual College Board AP exam, they can make it up. Since that\u2019s normally in May, the exam is just a normal class test.", "I'm in the military, if my guys and I don't do our job it is a threat to national security. Our command has put out guidance for mental health days. What the fuck are two teenage girls doing that is so much more important that they cannot afford a mental health day? YTA.", "YTA. Why not call their teacher and ask if they can take the exam the next day? Odds are the teacher will have no problem with it.", "YTA, do you honestly think your daughters were able to focus on their classwork today? This is a single test that they can write later. But hey, now your daughters know you don't give a f*ck about their feelings.", "YTA. I'm very sorry for your loss, but I feel like your priorities weren't in the right place. You weren't letting your daughters grieve in the way they needed to, and you made it seem like something that was able to be rescheduled was more important than they were. Everyone grieves differently, and there's no timeline for when you learn to live with it. Please take their grief into consideration if you're faced with something like this again.", "YTA. I hope for your daughters'sake this was a lapse in judgement on your part and no indicative of how you usually treat them.", "YTA, they should get the day off to grieve *especially* when there\u2019s an exam scheduled for the day. How well do you think your teenage daughters will be able to concentrate on the first anniversary of their mother\u2019s death? How exactly do you think it\u2019ll help them to get a grade that doesn\u2019t mirror what they know but instead how well they were able to ignore their feelings on such a day?\n\nETA I\u2019m a teacher. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d want my students to sit an exam on such a day.", "YTA- i get that you dont want them to miss out on the important exam. But it takes a phone call to the school to explain and have a retake test day for them :/ \n\nBesides taking an exam while grieving isn't gonna do that grade any favors...\n\nEdit: im so sorry for yours and your families loss, pls take care.", "One could argue that an exam is an even better reason to let them stay home that day. Taking the exam would mean more stress on an already awful day. \nYTA\nHowever in general I would never assume that you are an awful parent like some here think. It will be a tough day for you as well and I wish you the best.", "it's been a year. they miss their mother. it's just a test that can be done another time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nThey can take the test another day, only 1 day is the anniversary of their mother\u2019s death. Let them have their mental health day.", "YTA. When I'm stressing over things I try to put them into perspective by asking will I remember this in 5 years?  A missed exam (that they'll be able to make up anyway) will be long forgotten,  their mothers death will not.", "YTA\n\nDo you really think your daughter will benefit in any way from this course of action?\n\nShe is grieving and will not be able to focus that day. \n\nIt\u2019s been 7 years since my dad died suddenly and I still struggle on the anniversary of his death. It\u2019s a trauma and your body and mind remember.", "YTA, you should have spoken with the school and been your daughters\u2019 protector. They\u2019re so vulnerable right now and you have so little time left with them at home. It was an opportunity to move closer and instead it\u2019s now a source of pain.", "Yta holy crap. There's this funny thing called a phone that you can use to call the school and talk to the teacher to explain the situation.  If the teacher agrees, then what the fuck does it matter??", "YTA. The most major thing they have going on that day is the first anniversary of their mother's death. This is gross.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Parenting a grieving child is incredibly difficult, particularly since everyone grieves differently.   Trying to navigate between allowing them to grieve and not allowing them to be bogged down by grief  are choices you now have to make and you don't always know.  You weren't completely dismissive of their grief.  If they hadn't had a big test, you were going to allow it.  If it was any other Tuesday and they were bummed, encouraging school would have been correct.  It being the anniversary, those are much more difficult.  I know.  Mine lost her dad on Christmas.  Eight years later, it's a sad day for us now.  Christmas.  Try and make it up to them tonight.  Tell them you made a mistake, your learning this new world too, and see if they want to remember her tonight and stay home tomorrow.", "I am reluctant to call anyone an AH here  \nHowever, I would remind you that they are still very young and they are still grieving. That exam...not as big a deal. It really isn't.   \n\n\nLet them honor the anniversary. It will be the healthiest thing for all of you.", "YTA - The emotional needs of your children is more important than some test, that they can clearly make up. You messed up on this one.", "YTA and I can confidently say that without reading more than the title.", "Yta. I just had my mother's 3 year death anniversary. I tried to work and started publicly crying.  The way the world treats grief is wrong. There's no time limit, there's no getting over it, and it needs to be talked about. You should have stayed home with them and spent the day talking about their mom.", "A gentle YTA. I think you put too much weight on education and forgot to look at the girls needs. \n\nIt\u2019s been a hell of a year. Everything they had this year was without mam. That\u2019s what they\u2019ll be thinking of today. In stead of wondering what element is *insert element, they will cry and think * is the first letter of my mam\u2019s name. \n\nThe three of you could really benefit of grieving together today. Remembering the good times, make a new memory and tradition of April 19th and maybe cry together. That will do them so well. \n\nAnd you know that test? They would probably fail it due to the circumstances. If I was to be their teacher I would send them home.", "I won\u2019t go so far as to say YTA.. If I heard them discuss not wanting to take this test, I might have thought I was being played. I can see as a parent why you might think it\u2019s a bad idea to miss this exam. Having said that I think a phone call into the school would have cleared things up and they would have explained that the kids could totally make up that test on a day when their focus was not on this important anniversary.\n\nBut I know you\u2019re doing the best you can so maybe learn from this so you can make more informed decisions in the future. \n\nIn the mean time, maybe explain to your kids that you were concerned about them missing this test but after giving it some more thought you realize that maybe you made the wrong choice. It\u2019s ok to admit when you should have taken more time to decide on something. They have to understand how hard it is to make these kinds of choices without your partner. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for the loss your family has experienced.", "I think you are doing yr best under the circumstances but honestly yr girls were vocal in letting you know that they need time to grieve and you bypassed their needs. I understand where you are coming from and keeping them on track but a simple conversation with their teacher could have worked things out. Nah, you were doing what you thought was best but I would suggest listening to yr kids and understand where they are coming from. My mom died in my 30's and I was a mess for 3 years straight on her death anniversary and birthday. There is no timetable for grief. Just comfort yr girls and let them know you are trying.", "YTA. If this were *the* AP exam, you'd have a point: APs are big and stressful and are problematic to reschedule. But this looks like an ordinary test for a prep class: something they could have afforded to miss.", "YTA. First question  - are you even mourning your wife's death? You seem to have moved on pretty fast.  Second question  - do you have any compassion at all for your children?", "You're kind of the asshole, gentle YTA\n\nI understand wanting to help your girls process their emotions and prioritizing school is important.\n\nHOWEVER, upon finding out that there was a large exam, you should have called the school and explained the circumstances and asked to reschedule the test for a different day. That way your daughters would be able to take a day and process their grief while still being responsible for their academics.\n\nAt the VERY least you could have picked them up after the test or let them come in late for a half day as an attempt to compromise", "YTA. Do you really think they\u2019ll be able to concentrate on the test?", "Oof. YTA but I feel really bad for you because they will never forget this.", "YTA you messed up big time. They\u2019ll never forget what you did to them on the first anniversary of their mothers death", "Major YTA.\n\nIt's the first anniversary, they have good grades otherwise, and they can make it up. Why would you make them AND expect them to just suck up and deal? You reap what you sow.", "Not only are you an asshole, you're a dick", "NTA.  Being a parent is hard, especially a single parent.  Do your best and always in a loving way.  Best of luck and sincere condolences.", "YTA what in the actual hell is wrong with you? Mine has been gone 3 years tomorrow and I already know I\u2019m going to be a mess. That\u2019s a pain that doesn\u2019t go away and you live with it forever. The loss of a mother has a huge impact especially on her daughters. They\u2019re going to be grieving all over again tomorrow because that\u2019s the day she had to leave them. How was she married to an emotionless monster like you?? You however are the perfect example of what NOT to do as a parent.", "YTA... They are children and they are human. They should be able to stay home one day to mourn the loss of their mother. This could lead to future resentment. I'm sorry for your loss as well as theirs. They deserve to grieve", "YTA. Huge.  I'm 36, my step father died very suddenly 7 years ago.  I still take that day off to sit in my feelings.  The thing with grief is it never goes away,  you learn to carry it,  but on this big days,  birthdays,  anniversaries,  it crushes you.  You really think they'd do well in the test in the anniversary of their mothers death??? The VET FIRST ANNIVERSARY??? I can't function on the anniversary.  I literally lay on the ground because it's the only thing that keeps me from feeling unbelievable panic and sorrow.  My partner understands this,  gets on the ground with me and let's me have my day.  They can make up the test.  They won't be able to trust you with their very real feelings if grief and emotional health if you don't let them take the day off.", "YTA!!! only a year since???? give them breaks damn", "Obviously", "Your daughters will fail this exam if you make them take it. That looks so much worse for potential schools than missing it to grieve their mother and retaking when they\u2019re in a better headspace. YTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, and I\u2019m sorry for their loss. They need time.", "YTA\u2014death anniversaries are hard even many years later. It\u2019s been 6 years since my husband passed away and I still give our kids the option to take the day off.", "I'm sorry for your loss. I can't imagine how difficult it has been to handle your own grief and try to manage,  emotionally and practically,  as the single father to two teenage girls. \n\nI do not think you're an asshole and it's only for the purposes of the sub that I must say...\n\nYTA\n\nI schedule myself the day off on my mom's birthday and on the anniversary of her death.  \n\nI'm 54, she's been gone 9 years and I STILL can't predict what my mental state will be on those two dates so I don't take on any obligations and give myself room to be a mess, if that's what happens. \n\nThey are 16 and still actively grieving their mother.  Having to make up a test will not do any lasting harm. It will do far less harm than getting a bad grade because they couldn't focus or (and this is a real possibility) having one of those uncontrollable storms of grief in the middle of class. \n\nLet them take the day. Go pick them up.", "Yep YTA \n\nDo you really think they are going to do well on a test when their emotions are so messed up?", "I'm sorry this is a difficult time. I lost my mom as a child and we never did anything on her death anniversary. Years later I'm struggling with unresolved grief and I think the lack of acknowledgement of her death by my family has something to do with it. I would advise to take some time off to process.\nYTA, there's big picture stuff here, this is an occasion to show up for each other", "You forced them to go to school and take an exam??? Do you honestly think that they did well on an exam with the 1 year anniversary of their mom\u2019s passing weighing on them? A good parent would have contacted the school about those extenuating circumstances and asked if they could take the exam on another day. YTA", "YTA. They can make it up, and it\u2019s not a big deal. Do you understand how modern school works? \n\nMy dad died when I was 15. Every birthday, anniversary, or special day hit me like a ton of bricks. You expect your kid to take a test on the anniversary of their moms death? \n\nWhen you make it clear to your kids that a test is more important than their mental well-being you are also making it clear you are not someone to be trusted with their emotions.", "YTA. Biggest ever. They grieving their mother, and all you care about in Chemistry. Do you like your daughters?", "YTA and heartless.", "NTA. I can tell you are really trying and this is still so fresh/raw. Hard to navigate. \nThat said: Anything \u201cmajor\u201d is subjective, but the bigger issue is that even if something \u201cmajor\u201d was going on, the kids will be a wreck trying to participate in said \u201cmajor\u201d thing and it will not be anywhere near their best effort. I don\u2019t think this rises to the level of AH but I also think it was a bad call to make them go. It is obvious that despite their mother\u2019s death that you are trying to keep their academic world & future from falling apart. Commendable. But, the anniversary a year out from traumatic event might be a day where they get to call the shots & have some control. \nTake care of yourselves.", "NTA\n\nI do think they could have taken the test another day, but it doesn\u2019t seem you had any ill intentions with telling them to go. Being single with two children/teenagers all of a sudden can be hard. But for the future I\u2019d recommend to involve the school and maybe tell them all they need to know and with what you\u2019re comfortable sharing. Situations like this could be avoided in the future then. It seems like this is very recent though, so I don\u2019t think YTA for this, you\u2019re grieving yourself and still have to take care of your daughters, it\u2019s normal to make \u201cmistakes\u201d in situations we don\u2019t know. I wish you and your daughters the best!", "NAH. Your heart was in the right place. You\u2019re trying to do what\u2019s best for your daughters. You\u2019re not perfect. Tell them you love them, let them vent or be silent, but just let them know you\u2019re there for them. This is just an unbelievably rough situation.", "I'm going with NTA for one reason -- Would their mother want them to miss their exam?  Probably not.", "NTA. Your daughters have a right to their grief but they have to learn to handle it while also continuing to live their lives and take responsibility for their emotions. It is good to teach them that they can be sad and still function rather than be crippled by it.", "NAH I mean- you can make up tests in school.\n\nYour daughters needed to be upfront with you or to have spoken with their teacher about it so they could make a plan. So that this didn't happen. Teachers understand that kids are going thru things- and having lost a parent, needing to take a day on the anniversary of that loss? Your kids aren't going to do stellar on that test just because you made them take it.\n\nCuz yeah, I think you should have kept them home and let them make up the test later. But they shouldn't have tried to hide that they had a test- or they should have hidden it better.\n\nSo maybe that was the real lesson here. Your kids need to learn to lie better.", "NTA.", "Call the school, explain the situation, and arrange for them to make up the exam.", "YTA.   I'm an adult. My dad died in 2021. On the one year anniversary of his death, I  would not have been able to take a chemistry test.   AND I'VE BEEN AN ACTUAL CHEMIST FOR 20 YEARS.", "Maybe not the best way to handle that whole thing, but I won't go so far as to say YTA.\n\nPerhaps you might have contacted the school and asked? If your daughters said they could make it up after school, then you should have gone with that. I know for a fact they have make up days for AP tests. A call to the school should have cleared that up.\n\nThis was the first anniversary. It would have been better to have all been together that day.", "YTA  , they probably did not even study for that exam...", "YTA\n\nIt's a high school test, that they could make up especially if you called and explained the situation. \n\nWhen they fail because their minds were on their mother's passing it's on you.", "YTA. I lost my parents when I was pretty young, many years ago. It's still incredibly difficult. Some years, it's a bit of a sad day, but other times, I have a really difficult time coping. Both of those reactions are normal. You can't make yourself get over grief, and it doesn't just go away. When people aren't supportive and don't allow for time and a safe space in which to mourn, it's impossible to really process it and to learn how to live with it in ways that aren't detrimental to emotional and mental health. As teenagers, especially, your daughters are still forming what will ultimately be their standard responses to grief, trauma, loss and compassion. You're being quite negligent in this area, and really doing far more harm than good. Classes and tests can be made up for. Emotional and psychological development has a finite timeline, and that kind of damage can easily last forever. So will their memories of how you helped or hindered them in managing their ability to grieve, and learn to move forward with, such a devastating loss.", "YTA \n\nI expect the marks they get on that test will be much lower than their usual grade due to the distractions caused by the grief and memories.\n\nThat test could have easily been rescheduled.\n\nYou just seriously damaged the trust your daughters have in your ability and willingness to support them emotionally.  Time to do some serious communicating which better be started with heartfelt apologies.", "Yeah, not naming names for privacy, but I had an employee that always took the anniversary of their moms death of every year. It didn\u2019t matter that it had been a bit, they were allowed to mourn and spend it the way they chose. I had a manager like you that didn\u2019t care, but you can bet I went to bat for them and covered the shift anyway if the employee got added back on. Have some compassion.\n\nEdit to add the judgement. Lol. YTA", "Your girls have been stressing about this day for a month. Kids make up work/ tests at school all the time. Make it up to them and the three of you stay home tomorrow and do something special together. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an a A H but you didn\u2019t handle this well", "YTA. How do you except them to do well on a test on the anniversary death of their mom? I know you're going through a lot as well but remember everybody handles grieve differently. YTA because you aren't valuing their feelings and what they're going through.", "YTA, and my heart hurts for your girls. There is no possible way they will do well on this test today, and it is unreasonable to expect them to. You are showing that this test means more to you than their hearts and their grief. You are also showing them they can't count on you to be an advocate at school. \n\nI am a teacher, and I used to be a science teacher. If any parent or student had called or emailed me about a situation like this, I would have immediately told them that I would let them make up the test. They are 16 years old. Their mental well-being HAS to come first. Not only is it so much more important than a test, but \"You have to do the Maslow before you can do the Bloom.\" Their physical needs and sense of safety are a critical part of education. You cannot learn or convey what you know without first having those base needs met. \n\nYou are doing your best, and I know this is an incredibly painful time for all of you. Apologize to your children and go talk to their teacher. You screwed up. Work on repairing the relationship with your girls.", "YTA. \n\nYour just trying to figure out the right answer. So no malicious YTA.\n\nSomething that you may not have considered is how being forced to take that exam in their mental state would affect their grades.\n\nIf the test can be made up on a different date. Than let them do that. It\u2019s better for them mentally, and will be better for their grade if it can be made up.", "Soft YTA\n\nIt\u2019s the first anniversary of her death. Being at school around a bunch of people while you are thinking about your mom and how she is dead is ROUGH. I don\u2019t think they would do well on that test ya know? \n\nYou are trying to do what you think is best for you kids and their education but I really think you need to consider that this one test (which can be taken later) needs to take the backseat on this one. This is a huge, huge day for your kids. \n\nThe grief you and your kids feel will never go away. You just sort of learn to make room for it as time goes on. with that time you add things to the room and don\u2019t look at that grief so often but as of now it\u2019s on center display. On this first anniversary there isn\u2019t going to be enough space in that room to hold all that grief. They haven\u2019t, and you haven\u2019t, learned this part yet. \n\nGo easy on yourself and your babies during this hard time. I am so, so sorry for your loss.", "Back when I was 15 my mother passed away too. I had exams on her anniversary too and idc what anyone says if my Dad has considered sending me to school I\u2019d have made a plan to move out and go NC then and there. Obviously YTA they can always re-do a test but they won\u2019t forget this anytime soon, if at all.", "YTA\n\nHonestly I would be surprised if your girls were actually still at school.. If I were them I would have just skipped and gone somewhere I could grieve. Sad that they don't have your support when needed.. \n\nI lost both of my parents at a fairly young age however I was in my 20s when the first passed.. I was lost for a really long time. I had no one to lean on..  I feel so bad for your girls to be in the same predicament.. At least they have each other since they obviously can't count on you.", "Hey man I saw they got you down with their judgement of YTA. \n\nDon't let em, this sub is just full of bored, judgemental and *bitter* people. When I want to get better at being a snarky toolbag, I browse here. These people have honed the art of passive aggressiveness and will almost always say YTA. \n\nIt's almost a setup.", "YTA for multiple reasons but mainly you didn\u2019t stick to your word. They planned on taking a mental health day on the anniversary. Then 2 days before taking the exam you told them they have to go. I totally wouldn\u2019t be prepared mainly bc 2 days isn\u2019t enough. But also wtf imagine u went into an exam thinking about the death of your mother. Please go pick up your children apologize and try to celebrate their moms life and grieve.", "Please advocate for your daughters grief. Talk to the school. My mum lost her mum when she was 16 at a time when things weren't really talked about. She admitted to us later in life how it fucked her up. How not having her dad talk to the school regarding the difficult days, for having to go in while feeling numb from the world.\n\nYWBTA if you made them go. Please take the day to do something together for your wife and their mum. Make her favourite food and chat about your memories, go to a place you would go with her, or shut yourself in your room and spend the day in bed, just grieve in your way and advocate for your daughters to grieve in theirs.", "Let them stay home, maybe stay with them too and do something special in remembrance", "I\u2019m not going to bash you. Grief is hard to navigate.  Our son died 6 years ago. If our daughter needs a mental health day, we let her take it.   That being said, it can\u2019t be used as a crutch which can easily happen when there is something they don\u2019t want to do.   You are doing the best you can but, yes, go get them from school and give them the day.", "Of course you\u2019re the asshole! They don\u2019t want a day off, they want to be able to grieve and remember their mum in private on the anniversary of her death. Not the next fucking day. It was one stupid test, who gives a fuck! They could have made it up. YTA", "INFO What did the Chem teacher say about being able to reschedule the girls\u2019 test when you called them to explain the situation? You did talk to the teacher, right? Cause that\u2019s the logical thing to do.", "I was 17 when I lost my Mom. The next year of school, my teachers practically FORCED me to take the anniversary of her death off. My math teacher went so far as to tell me \"If I see you set foot in this building tomorrow, I'm driving you home myself.\" \ud83d\ude02  That being said, I had expressed my want to take that day off a few times before. If it would have distracted me/been of comfort to me to be IN school on that day, my teachers wouldn't have batted an eye, but that's not what I wanted. They supported me either way. Any parent or teacher worth their salt would do the same thing. \n\nYou're their FATHER. Don't make the same mistakes mine did. Let your children grieve how they want to, or I promise you it will affect their mental health VERY poorly. It's been a decade since my Mom passed, but due to my father's treatment of me during the year or so after her death, I'm STILL in therapy dealing with my grief. \n\nYour daughters can make up the test, so school be damned! Let them have the day off. This is not about what you'd prefer, this is about your daughters' mental health and your wife's memory. Do right by your daughters and by your wife. Her memory is now the most important thing in the world to them. \n\nYes, YTA. You're a major asshole if you make them go to school.", "YTA, big time.  A simple phone call is all it would have taken to arrange for the girls to take the test another day, but you couldn\u2019t be bothered.  Instead you force your grieving daughters to not only face school on such a horrible anniversary, but to take a test they will absolutely do poorly on or even fail.\n\nAnd I bet you took the day off from work without a second thought", "YTA, call the school and let them have the day off. If it's an important exam the school will let them take it another time.", "YTA. Sounds like because you may grieve differently than them (it sounds like you\u2019re a push through/mind over matter guy) and expect your daughters to be the same. Is that fair to them? I hope your relationship with them isn\u2019t too damaged.", "YTA and if you think there\u2019s even a snowball\u2019s chance in hell that they perform well on this test ON THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR MOTHER\u2019S DEATH then you\u2019re as much of an idiot as you are an asshole. My mother died 7 years ago this July and I\u2019m still useless on the anniversary as well as her birthday and on Mother\u2019s Day. Last time I tried to work on one of those days I broke down in tears halfway through my shift and had to go home early anyway. And I\u2019m a whole ass adult. I was an adult when she died. You\u2019re expecting way too much out of your *children*", "They are going to do horribly on the exam so it is kind of pointless to take it.", "Omg it's been a year only and you can't let them make up the damn exam another day?? YTA holy cow", "YTA. The major thing they have going on is their mom's death, not an AP chem test.", "Boohoo people can be sooo mean! YTA. They lost their mum ffs. Stop being the victim", "Oh good Yta. I lost my mom as an adult in my 20\u2019s and I take her death anniversary off as well as her birthday every year. I forgot to take her death anniversary off this year and you know what I did at work? Nothing. I could barely stop crying long enough to read an email. *You don\u2019t get to dictate how other people grieve. Much less a child. Let those girls rest!*", "YTA", "Grief is SO weird.  On my mom's birthday,  the first one after she crossed the river,  I went to absolute pieces because I ran out of conditioner.  I was just so brittle that that was all it took to leave me a sobbing , shaking mess on the shower floor . I probably would have come undone over an uncooperative dish, too.", "I hope your husband came home and gave you a big hug", "For real. I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t do that well on said test considering how upset they were. This was avoidable. YTA. Life is about being flexible as well as responsible. I get what OP thought but he needs to chill.", "came to say exactly this. a test can be delayed or rescheduled, but their grief can't. this is the same day their mother died a year ago and that date will always be painful for them.", "Also, if the school isn't informed in advance and they bomb the test due to grief distraction, they're a LOT less likely to get a chance to make it up. I'm lucky enough to have never lost a parent but the first anniversary of a grandparent death poleaxed me... and these kids are 16 and it was their mother...", "Based on the time of year, it might be the actual AP exam which is paid for in advance and nationally administered at the same time and date at every school in the US. There are no retakes if you miss it. If it's the actual national exam, I understand not letting them miss it, even if it is unfortunate. Need more INFO.", "I\u2019d argue that taking the test at a different time would help them score higher most likely as well. I can\u2019t imagine sitting and somehow managing to focus on a major exam on the first anniversary of my mom\u2019s unexpected death. I feel for the girls, they are going to need that day for themselves. The school will understand.", "Reschedule for the girls alone or try to have the teacher move the whole test date?", "I\u2019m kinda Sus about this entire post. I looked at the AP exam dates (worldwide) and the chemistry one is Monday May 1st. So either this is their class\u2019s exam (which could reasonably be rescheduled with their teacher) or this is a troll. AP exams are never this early.\n\nAnd even then, college board has alternate exam dates available. I remember last year our AP physics exam conflicted with senior prom so they were able to move it for us to be a week later as to not conflict with prom.", "Can they make it up without a doctor's note? I live in a different country, but in high school we weren't allowed to make up exams without a doctor's note. If they could've made it up YTA tho.", "I hope the teacher lets them sit out the test and make it up later.", "Just finished reading. I get your point 100%, but dude, how are you feeling only 1 year after her passing? I promise you what they\u2019re feeling about it is much more intense, they\u2019re kids. If they\u2019re confident they can make it up, you could easily just chat with their teacher to sort it out, these are definitely extenuating circumstances.", ">The way the world treats grief is wrong. \n\nI'm only familiar with my own culture's approach to death and mourning (US) and I agree 100%. We're supposed to pull it together and be functional when we are dealing with the emotional equivalent of being caught in the middle of a 15 car pile up in the fog. Grief is messy and should be acknowledged,  accommodated and honored.", ">gentle\n\nF that dude is heartless.       \nInstead of having his children's back on the one year anniversary of their mothers death he's making them take an exam that doesn't really matter and can be rescheduled (given the circumstances).     \n     \nNot a gentle YTA, he's a big fat raging YTA.", "what a disgusting thing to say to a grieving husband.", "I agree he's the 'AH' but as someone who lost their dad at a similar age to the girls, we have to remember not to he so harsh. he's not a monster and he's still grieving, he doesn't need a lecture from you on what grief is like, he's a first time single dad trying his best to pick up the pieces after he lost the love of his life. have some empathy and compassion for gods sake, this comment is incredibly ironic", "They can take one of the makeup exams. They\u2019re not going to do well if they have to take it that day.

Probably not.", "How the fuck did you reach that conclusion? Why wouldn't their mother be okay with it?", "Yeah, force children too hide their emotions and to never dare to be sad.", "They\u2019re children\u2026", "It really is. My dad just passed away two days before my mom's three years in October. My husband took the day off work. I allowed my kids to stay home from school. To say it was a hard day is an understatement.", "I started screaming at the AC repairman on the anniversary of my mom\u2019s death.", "Exactly there is no way they would be able to focus on the test with that hanging over them, plus they would now have added feelings of resentment towards their father.", "AP tests are in May, so this was likely just a class test. \n\nAnd there is a way to make up the actual AP test (possibly with an additional fee, I'm not sure about that part).", "Well American national exams usually happen around may and June so I highly doubt this is what these are. I'm not American so it might be earlier this year but I doubt it.", "It\u2019s most likely just an exam in their AP class, like others mentioned, they generally don\u2019t happen until May or June. In high school there were ways to take the AP exam at a different time I\u2019m pretty sure, but I wouldn\u2019t take my word alone for that since it\u2019s been a long time since I had to take an AP test. Generally AP testing to attempt to score highly enough to get college credit for it happens the same week as final exams in my experience.\n\nIt\u2019s a good thought and definitely worth OP figuring out for sure whether it\u2019s an actual AP exam or just an exam being given in an AP class.", "The girls alone \nLike have them come in early another day or miss a lunch.", "It's probably just a class test", "It\u2019s an AP exam. They usually have their own policies for makeup testing.", "Honestly? I can imagine him having his own grieve. And having promised something like \u2018make sure the girls finish their education\u2019 to their mam. \n\nThat\u2019s what made it gentle for me. And it\u2019s just so f* up that 13 year olds loose their mam, but that wasn\u2019t the question.", "I got a little confused by this too. The AP Chemistry Exam is one of those high-stakes standardized tests that gets administered to everybody on the same day, and missing it could cause serious problems. If that's what OP is talking about, then there really is a question of whether the mom would be okay with her kids missing it.\n\nHowever, on a second look, I don't think the April 19 test is actually that particular exam (which should be in early May for this year). It's probably just an ordinary test in a class designed to prepare kids for the big exam. And yeah, the mom would probably be okay if her kids missed that.", "Oh, Honey...that's a lot of pain too absorb in a short time.  I am so sorry and I am grateful that it sounds like you have some good, loving support. If you take virtual hugs from strangers,  I am sending a very gentle one.", "It's been so long since I took my AP exams I can't even remember what month they're scheduled, lol.\n\nIf it's just a class exam, then OP is Y T A (sounds like that may be the case if the girls say they can make it up later). If it's the actual AP exam, that's a different situation. I believe you're correct though about being able to reschedule it but the details on the College Board website are a bit vague.", "It\u2019s not the actual AP exam, it\u2019s a part of the AP class they\u2019re taking. They can easily make it up by talking to their teacher.", "Yeah, I read this as just an exam for the class, not THE exam", "this is wrong as someone who graduated a few years back and has a 17 year old brother thats not how it works if you miss the test they still have you take it else where", "Thank you. \u2665\ufe0f I just can't imagine being 16 and having to put my focus on an exam rather then take a mental health day and grieve my mom.
