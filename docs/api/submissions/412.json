It roughly took me 17 hours(it was more error and more figuring out how to attach the both picture).\n Anyway I send her two pictures one with a dressing table  and one without it.

Maybe bottom right corner or blended into a background feature.", "NTA. You\u2019re the artist. An unpaid one at that.", "YTA - a watermark in the middle of the picture is asshole.

Ask for payment next time or let them know ahead of time that free work will have a water mark", "NTA.\n\nAn artist's watermark is to show they have drawn it and it belongs to them. As long as this watermark is not huge then it's fine.

An artist\u2019s watermark is the most important, especially for a commission piece that took 17 hours and came at no cost.

Your work is still branded but not in a way that interferes with your friend's pleasure in the piece.  I absolutely support artists marking their work in some way-watermark, label,  seal, signature whatever is appropriate for the medium used (and in paintings, photos and such, it can't be somewhere it can just be cropped out)but I have seen marks used in ways that diminish the piece.  \n(One of my favorite things is a friend who draws mostly still lifes always includes a book somewhere in the picture & their watermark goes where a book publisher would put the company logo. Very effective without being too obvious)", "There's no reference to figure out how relatively large it is but yeah, that too.", "Then NTA. Every artist has a right to sign their work."]}
