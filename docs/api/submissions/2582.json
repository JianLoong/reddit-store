We have allowed her to stay over and I\u2019ve made her dinner and my bf would put her to bed (which in the moment I didn\u2019t find it bizarre). \n\nA week ago, he came up with the idea to take her to a retreat for a weekend and when I asked to come, he determinately told me no. That night I had a weird gut feeling but suppressed it. \n\nThe next day, I informed him that if he takes her to this \u201cretreat\u201d I would not allow him back into my life because not only is it unnecessary, it is also bizarre. He then told me that he\u2019ll call it off.\n\nHis step sister has been treating me weirdly which made me acknowledge that she knows what I said. My bf has also told me that \u201cmy mind is grotesque\u201d.

When you\u2019re older you\u2019ll see that the reason 30 years olds go after 19 year olds is not because the 19 year old is mature but because the 30 year is too Immature for anyone there on own age. At 19 you think you\u2019re on top of the world and nothing can hurt you and you know everything you need to know now because why would they let you by booze if youre still a kid but the truth is at 19 you barely know anything, it\u2019s like the saying driving lessons teach you to pass the test but not how to drive .\nYou know how to do what you\u2019ve been doing, like high school, college, part time jobs but at 19 you don\u2019t really know anything about the real world and we learn things about the real world by learning from those who went before us and by experiencing it yourself and when EVERYONE who\u2019s been there is telling you the same thing it means something.", "Because youre 19. I\u2019m sorry but when you\u2019re not 19 you\u2019ll get it. I hate to sound condescending but it\u2019s true. It\u2019s like when your parents say school will be the easiest time of your life and you think to yourself they don\u2019t have a clue how hard your life is but then you grow up and join the real world and realise they were completely right", "When you grow up your won\u2019t.", "You disagree because you don\u2019t have much life experience. Know what type of 29 yo date 19 yo and have inappropriate relationships with their step sister? Creeps and predators. You will learn someday, just hopefully you are too far gone with kids or something before you realize. Once you grow up a bit you\u2019ll see how naive you are. NTA for stopping this incestious retreat I guess", "So you yourself can see the association and similarities between you and a 13 year old\u2026", "Girl that ain\u2019t the flex you think it is lmao", "OP, that is literally a grooming tactic. You\u2019re not \u201cmature for your age\u201d, you\u2019re just young & na\u00efve & that\u2019s exactly what he wants. I\u2019ve been in this position myself, nothing about it is healthy. You\u2019re going to have a rude awakening if you don\u2019t start opening your eyes before it\u2019s too late. \n\nAnd you already know your relationship isn\u2019t healthy when there\u2019s such a red flag regarding the nature of his relationship with his step sister.", "Okay my bad but still\u2026 can\u2019t see the color red or?", "Yes, it is unfortunately. The \"I'm very mature for my age\" attitude is exactly what they're looking for. It's easier to groom someone who thinks they're too mature to be groomed.", "Oh yeah then that\u2019s very different.. \nOP has your boyfriend and his step sister being doing a lot of laundry together?", "so immense", "Listen to that song by Demi Lovato. Finally 29, 17 would never cross my mind. It\u2019s resonated worldwide for a reason. We all thought we were overly mature at 19. When you turn 29 you\u2019ll realize how creepy it is", "That's the most mature comment you've made.", "How do you figure? You\u2019re 19 and you\u2019re acting your age.", "I was told the exact same thing by a 29 year old when I was 19. I was also told I was just sooooo mature. \n\nYou'll look back at this relationship in horror.", "And not every step sibling relationship is porno waiting to happen but you seem to going on about that\u2026", "You grew up so fast you didn't think to have an actual conversation with him about things before giving him an ultimatum? Umm, ok.\n\nYou didn't give any examples of how they're \"abnormally close\" and this is just a feeling you have. Is it jealousy? I think the feeling you have is jealousy and you're deliberately leaving info out to lead people to believe that he's doing something inappropriate with his step sister. YTA", "That is a lie that groomers tell their victims", "Said every 19 year old, ever", "Yeah its called grooming.", "It\u2019s creepy, I\u2019m sorry but it is.", "And sometimes age gaps are creepy\u2026 this is one of those times", "If you think he wants to shag his step sister why are you still with him?", "So you know he\u2019s fucking her? Why are you with him then?", "Ok? And?", "Oh right, because you made wild conclusions not reflecting the facts leaving me in a position to stand up for my wonderful relationship.. that means I\u2019m inherently wrong?! Your reasoning is about as sharp are your writing skills, my friend.", "I understand & I see straight through him.", "I completely agree & I will break up with him. Thank you for your comment", "She\u2019s closer in age to the 13yo than her partner, so\u2026 \ud83d\ude2c", "\u201cGrooming\u201d is not what is taking place here, I\u2019m 19 & fully aware of my decisions.", "Yeah I look a lot younger than I am & regularly get hit on by 19yo's at my work....my immediate thought is \"eeewwww\" I am 34....what the hell would I even do with a 19yo? Give them a juice box & some Dino nuggies?! They can't even buy cigarettes or alcohol!", "In this case, I fear it is.", "You are entitled to your opinion.", "\u201cSometimes\u201d", "No because you an Adult who had experience of the world, who had established himself, who had maybe got the career, who was probably living in his own and paying his own way, who had savings, loans, rent/mortgage, who had been and done college or whatever you did after school, who had done the partying with friends, staying up all night, had dated and And met new people, had choices. Went after a person who had barely left there parents roof, who probably had none of those experiences who didn\u2019t experience life, to him you was the cool older guy but as the proper adult in that situation it was down to you to not cross that line but you did and you know you did.", "It might hurt now but honestly in time you\u2019ll realise that not being with him is the best thing for you, you\u2019re 19 live your life for you, because when you get older you\u2019d regret not doing that. Go out and meet knew people, date different boys or girls whatever your preference is, date yourself even. HAVE FUN. It\u2019s such a grandma thing to say but you\u2019re only young once and nows the time to enjoy that not spending your evenings worrying about what a creepy guy is doing with his creepy step sister.", "OP has stated she has going to break up with him, all joking aside I think she\u2019s where we\u2019ve all been, we\u2019ve all been that 19 year old who knows everything about life and hopefully by posting on here we\u2019ve helped her not have some of the major regrets we\u2019ve had", "Then that means you don\u2019t trust your boyfriend so you shouldn\u2019t be with him", "Then break up with him...why ask reddit? What a crazy thing to do...just leave him if you are sure about it...", "Then leave. Let him do what he wants and have his relationship with his stepsister. If you really feel this way, find someone else. That's the \"immensely mature\" thing to do. YTA", "Yeah and your creepy boyfriend is entitled to whatever relationship he wants with his step sister and at least you asked for our opinion before getting it given, your boyfriend however did Not", "Yes, my life was established. Yes, he was in college and establishing his own. Then, we established a life together. That\u2019s typically how successful relationships work. He now has a PhD is recognized as a thought leader within his industry and we share a productive marriage where we handle decisions together. So, yes I am a little more on the immature side and he is a little more on the mature side. We combine wonderfully. \n\nI do agree if done wrong, a relationship that spans too many years can be detrimental to one or both parties. We were careful and have done our best to make something beautiful that enriches us both. Love and peace to you. I\u2019m done defending the love of my life to a stranger.", "I\u2019m not sure. I fear it. But I don\u2019t think it has happened. It\u2019s just my paranoia.", "Then you are going to drive yourself crazy...and if you really love him...and trust him ~you wouldn't be thinking about this...would you? Something about him is making you have this thought.", "Cameras. Discreet cameras.", "I do love him but I have trust issues with everyone."]}
