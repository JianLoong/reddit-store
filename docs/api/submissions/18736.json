I don't usually enjoy lots of festivities, surprises, or attention, but I do like spending quality time with the people nearest to me -- specifically my husband and a few close friends. This year, my birthday falls on a weekend that's somewhat tied up due to family functions (i.e., graduations, dinner with visiting family, etc.), so I've known for awhile I'd be sharing my birthday weekend with others. No biggie really. But just now, my husband called me with an \"early birthday surprise\". He said he didn't realize he had PTO to use up before the end of the school year and is taking a four day weekend. I have PTO but my busy job doesn't allow for me to take time off with such little notice. So here's where I'm at: 1) Him taking time off in this way is not a birthday present, and 2) He didn't ask if I could also take the time off or attempt to plan around days that would work for me.

How do you refuse that? I don't understand. It's he going on vacation? Or sticking around the house? How is this a surprise? Lol, so many questions.", "\nIf I understand it correctly, It\u2019s not really leaving you out so much as the schedule just happen to work out in that he had to take PTO, and he naturally thought to take it on your birthday because it was the only meaningful time to take off in his mind. \n\nPerhaps he can use the time off to do all the chores you\u2019d normally do, take care of any hosting duties, preparations, etc to allow you extra time to relax after work.", "NTA. You didn't refuse his gift, you can't accept it. And he should have asked you before arranging it.", "Not a gift. Great for him; useless for you. Maybe it's a gift to himself... **NTA**.", "NTA. Unless he\u2019s taking that time off to deep clean the house, take care of your to-do list backlog, and otherwise take care of responsibilities that would otherwise be yours so you can relax on your birthday weekend, it\u2019s in no way a present \u201cfor you\u201d.", "Meh, this isn\u2019t a birthday present for you.  This is time off for him to do what he wants.  That isn\u2019t necessarily wrong, but he is not allowed to call it \u201cyour birthday present\u201d.   He is allowed to call it his time off.  Don\u2019t argue about it, but repeat, this isn\u2019t my birthday6 present, this is your time off, which is fine, just don\u2019t try to gaslight me.   And kindly keep this off social media.

How is that even a gift for you.   Ridiculous.", "NTA. That isn't a gift in any way.  That sounds like a very lazy replacement for a real gift because he couldn't be bothered.", "Doesn't sound like he was trying to be mean.

I don't think either of you are.", "NTA\n\nI wonder if his PTO situation would've been less upsetting and more of a mild bummer that you couldn't get the same days off if he didn't try to frame it as having a birthday surprise for you. \n\nwhy the hell?  \"definitely should deliver my mini vacay news like it's a gift for her.. since it's her birthday. She'll fuckin LOVE IT\" \n\nwhat?", "Info:  When is the end of the school year?  Because sounds like either way he had to use the days quickly so he attempted to kill two birds with one stone but it didn't work out.", "NAH He was being thoughtful, he just didn't think his plan all the way through. Maybe he can use his free time to do something else nice for you; cook a nice meal, do some chores that you're normally responsible for, etc. Something to free up your time after work so when you get home you can just relax and do something nice together.", "NAH:  I'm really confused on all the husband hate here for taking off of work.  \n\nHe has tonuse his PTO before the school year ends.....which I'm pretty sure around this whole country is within the next few weeks. \n\nHe had to take off anyway,  hoped his wife could but she can't. He's not some evil guy", "I kinda did this for my partner this year. I impulsively booked off his Monday bday and then it turned out he couldn't (construction season). However.

It doesn't seem like he had bad intentions, he just didn't think it all the way through.", "INFO: What does \"calling him out for it\" mean?\n\nSounds like he didn't think there was time to really give you your own birthday until he got some unexpected time off and was hoping, last minute, this could work. It didn't. You shouldn't feel hurt by this. And you didn't explain that he was in some way mad about it not working out, so I don't see how he's the AH.\n\nMy tentative vote is for NAH, but your answer could make you the AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Let's say the husband came down in the morning and said he is taking days off as a birthday surprise.

With that said, I could have been clearer that it's less about him taking PTO and more about him framing it as a \"birthday surprise\". It implies that the time is for me - for quality time, acts of service, etc. While it would be great for him to clean, cook, treat me like a princess, etc., it still a bit contrived. Those things are wonderful when they happen, but I don't like building expectations around them.
