I don't usually enjoy lots of festivities, surprises, or attention, but I do like spending quality time with the people nearest to me -- specifically my husband and a few close friends. This year, my birthday falls on a weekend that's somewhat tied up due to family functions (i.e., graduations, dinner with visiting family, etc.), so I've known for awhile I'd be sharing my birthday weekend with others. No biggie really. But just now, my husband called me with an \"early birthday surprise\". He said he didn't realize he had PTO to use up before the end of the school year and is taking a four day weekend. I have PTO but my busy job doesn't allow for me to take time off with such little notice. So here's where I'm at: 1) Him taking time off in this way is not a birthday present, and 2) He didn't ask if I could also take the time off or attempt to plan around days that would work for me. I feel so left out and hurt. I know he didn't intend for it to work out this way, but I feel like he handled it so poorly. AITA for refusing his gift and calling him out for it.", "created_utc": 1685655348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xu3m2/aita_for_refusing_my_husbands_insensitive_bday/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I take a couple of days off of work and tell other people it\u2019s their gift. I save money AND don\u2019t have to work! I think it\u2019s worth exploring more, TBH. Is it exclusively for birthdays or\u2026how does Christmas work? Two days per gift?

I'm not even sure how that is a gift when you DO have time off", "NTA. Now go plan a girls' weekend or solo trip and tell him \"Happy Father's Day!\"", "NTA \n\nHis gift seems to be one to him from him. Shame he got you excited for an early gift that didn\u2019t pay off as he\u2019d hoped.", "\"Surprise!  I'm going on a vacation without you!\" What a loser NTA", "The gift is him having time off? How do you refuse that? I don't understand. It's he going on vacation? Or sticking around the house? How is this a surprise? Lol, so many questions.", "\nIf I understand it correctly, It\u2019s not really leaving you out so much as the schedule just happen to work out in that he had to take PTO, and he naturally thought to take it on your birthday because it was the only meaningful time to take off in his mind. \n\nPerhaps he can use the time off to do all the chores you\u2019d normally do, take care of any hosting duties, preparations, etc to allow you extra time to relax after work.", "NTA. You didn't refuse his gift, you can't accept it. And he should have asked you before arranging it.", "Not a gift. Great for him; useless for you. Maybe it's a gift to himself... **NTA**.", "NTA. Unless he\u2019s taking that time off to deep clean the house, take care of your to-do list backlog, and otherwise take care of responsibilities that would otherwise be yours so you can relax on your birthday weekend, it\u2019s in no way a present \u201cfor you\u201d.", "Meh, this isn\u2019t a birthday present for you.  This is time off for him to do what he wants.  That isn\u2019t necessarily wrong, but he is not allowed to call it \u201cyour birthday present\u201d.   He is allowed to call it his time off.  Don\u2019t argue about it, but repeat, this isn\u2019t my birthday6 present, this is your time off, which is fine, just don\u2019t try to gaslight me.   And kindly keep this off social media.   Because complaining to family and friends that I\u2019m \u201crejecting your birthday present\u201d is a dic*  move and I will call you out on it on the same social media/phone calls/texts you send to family and friends.", "You said it was an early birthday surprise, not a present. I took it as he will have more time to spend with you during whatever free time you have. I didn\u2019t think it was in lieu of some other present, such as dinner or a material gift.", "INFO: Is he really oblivious....not a planner?...why does he not see this is not a gift?", "Tell him to spend it doing housework and yardwork and other chores", "NTA!   How is that even a gift for you.   Ridiculous.", "NTA. That isn't a gift in any way.  That sounds like a very lazy replacement for a real gift because he couldn't be bothered.", "Doesn't sound like he was trying to be mean. He saw an opportunity and is trying to take it, but didn't quite think it all the way through. However, you are NTA. I don't think either of you are.", "NTA\n\nI wonder if his PTO situation would've been less upsetting and more of a mild bummer that you couldn't get the same days off if he didn't try to frame it as having a birthday surprise for you. \n\nwhy the hell?  \"definitely should deliver my mini vacay news like it's a gift for her.. since it's her birthday. She'll fuckin LOVE IT\" \n\nwhat?", "Info:  When is the end of the school year?  Because sounds like either way he had to use the days quickly so he attempted to kill two birds with one stone but it didn't work out.", "NAH He was being thoughtful, he just didn't think his plan all the way through. Maybe he can use his free time to do something else nice for you; cook a nice meal, do some chores that you're normally responsible for, etc. Something to free up your time after work so when you get home you can just relax and do something nice together.", "NAH:  I'm really confused on all the husband hate here for taking off of work.  \n\nHe has tonuse his PTO before the school year ends.....which I'm pretty sure around this whole country is within the next few weeks. \n\nHe had to take off anyway,  hoped his wife could but she can't. He's not some evil guy", "I kinda did this for my partner this year. I impulsively booked off his Monday bday and then it turned out he couldn't (construction season). However. I spent my day smoking ribs and making a birthday cake and cleaning the house. He was thrilled. I have a bad feeling OPs partner is not going to do any such things.", "NAH\n\nSorry his plan didn't work out.  It doesn't seem like he had bad intentions, he just didn't think it all the way through.", "INFO: What does \"calling him out for it\" mean?\n\nSounds like he didn't think there was time to really give you your own birthday until he got some unexpected time off and was hoping, last minute, this could work. It didn't. You shouldn't feel hurt by this. And you didn't explain that he was in some way mad about it not working out, so I don't see how he's the AH.\n\nMy tentative vote is for NAH, but your answer could make you the AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Well you could always surprise him by taking off work,  not telling him, and when he comes home say \u201chappy birthday \u201c, I had a great time.", "NTA as described\n\nHowever talking about a \"birthday weekend\" and saying sharing attention with others is \"no biggie really\" gives me a bit of a weird vibe here, in that OP may be a bit of a birthday drama queen. I could certainly be off base here.", "That's.... not a gift. NTA.", "NTA I'm a little confused, your husband's birthday gift to you is he's taking a four day weekend for himself?? Is he going to spend it cleaning the house, buying you a birthday present and making dinner for you?", "Unless he uses that time to deep clean the house, cook wonderful dinners for when OP gets home and maybe throws a birthday party. All of which I doubt he's doing. NTA", "I'm confused by your statement. According to the OP, the husband said it was a surprise. Which it literally is. There's no indication this is the gift he is giving her.\n\nDid the OP literally post this minutes after the interaction or at the end of the day?\n\nWhere are you reading in the post that this is the birthday gift he intends to give her and nothing else is planned?", "That made me lol \ud83d\ude02", "I mean it\u2019s good enough for the Presidents.

Sounds crazy I know but im.sure that's where his head was at", "Yeah, I think that's it exactly. If he has PTO, I want him to take it, and obvi, before it's too late to do so. But I certainly don't want to think of it as time gifted to me to dictate how he spends that time (i.e., cook, clean, cater to me, etc). Conversely, it would have felt like a gift/surprise if the time off could have been together.", "That's all fine and shit happens and def don't waste those days.. but leading that info with *I have a birthday surprise for you* was fucking stupid and weird", "He is passing off his use of PTO as a birthday gift to OP.  Like, even though this was last minute and OP can't join him in a long weekend, he's still counting it as his birthday gift.", "But what does any of that have to do with her birthday or a gift for her??", "He's an ass for passing this off as a \"gift\" instead of actually putting in effort for a real gift.", "The husband hate is exceedingly strong on this sub.", "Totally hear ya. By \"birthday weekend\" I mean an appropriate window to celebrate around when my birthday falls, which happens to be on a weekend this year.", "Until her face is on a cliff, there is no flattery.", "Yeah, but he made no effort to make sure, that's why it's stupid.", "Is he giving you an actual gift, or is this it? NTA either way, but I'm curious as to just how big of an asshole he is in this situation, lol. Like, was this supposed to be THE gift, or just an extra surprise (if it had worked out how he intended)", "I mean yea it was stupid to think his wife can take off last minute but he was being stupidly hopeful that he can make at least part of her birthday weekend special. \n\nWhatever happened to its the thought that counts", "Who said he's counting it as his birthday gift? Op birthday is tomorrow and he just found out about thr PTO. Pretty good chance her actual gift is in the closet lol.", "He said it was an early birthday surprise.

He has to take PTO or lose it.

What if after being \"called out\" he just didn't respond because he was hurt on her reaction. I mean OP never said how he responded. So that is a possibility.  \n\nOr he's waiting for her actual birthday to give her the gift. I mean personally that's what I would do.  Because giving her a gift while she's heated probably isn't the best idea.", "He took off on the days around her birthday.....hoping she can also take off....on the days around her birthday......you see how this has to do with her birthday", "He took it off because he has to or he will lose the time.\n\n> He said he didn't realize he had PTO to use up before the end of the school year", "We're the days he took around her birthday?", "Was there any other option?
