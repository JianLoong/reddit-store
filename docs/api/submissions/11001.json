It sounds like your neighbor's biggest problem is that she lives in an apartment building that other people actually live in. \nJust block her number and live your life. Stay neighborly when you can, and don't engage in her harassment.", " NTA - she shouldn\u2019t live in an apartment if she can\u2019t handle minimal noise", "NTA\n\nIf you live in an apartment you're occasionally going to hear your neighbors. If she doesn't like that, she needs to move to a cabin in the woods.", "NTA, you should block your neighbor on your phone. So you won't have to deal with your neighbor's nasty messages anymore.", "NTA.  I'll never understand why people who live in apartments think they are going to get complete quiet, 24 hours a day.  If you want that, buy a house--and even then you are going to hear some noise, sometimes.", "NTA. If she wants silent, she should move to a farm. An apartment building is not it.", "NTA block her hahaha", " I had a neighbour like this. He and his wife would costantly complain. Curiously, with the previous tenant, when burglars had entered the apartment by bringing down the whole door, they hadn't notice a thing.  \nOp, thick carpets might be useful. Other than that, don't be too preoccupied.", "NTA. It sounds like your neighbor is being overly sensitive and is not willing to be reasonable or understanding. You have every right to live in your own home and not be constantly harassed by your neighbor. While it's important to be mindful of noise levels, it's unreasonable for your neighbor to expect complete silence in a shared living situation. It's understandable that you would feel uncomfortable and frustrated with her constant complaints, and telling her that she is harassing you is a reasonable response. However, it may be helpful to try and have a calm and respectful conversation with her to see if you can come to a compromise or understanding.", "NTA-The clue is here: \"She has always been rude to us, the day we moved in she complained and didn\u2019t even say hello.\" The neighbor probably hates kids. Ignore her.", "I'm not going to vote.\n\nEven angelic toddlers can sound like a herd of pregnant elephants having a rave, if you live downstairs.   But if you live in an apt you gotta expect noise.\n\nIf you can tell me you have full-coverage carpets, and not bare wood floors, then n-t-a.  Otherwise, y-t-a.", "NTA.  She can move to an adults only complex if its such an issue for her.", "NTA - children are always gonna be loud. You choosing to not have them or being bothered by them doesn't entitle you to silence them. They drop things because they are clumsy while they explore the world. I think texting you is overstepping a boundary. Especially when it happens multiple times. Would probs consider to get a new phone number and not give it to her.", "NTA, as long as they don't run in the house or Rollerblade or play with a basketball ID say ots reasonable noise and that's just how it is. Living in an apartment building you hear the neighbors from time to time. It's fine if she messages you when the noise is constant for too long or extreme but she can do it on a nice way and use the word please", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It would be the nice thing to do, but after being harassed, I personally wouldn't be feeling very nice.\n\nI also won't vote because I was in OP's position once so I am biased -- I was harassed by my downstairs neighbor for simply walking around (on carpeted floors). It got to the point where I had to call the police on her. So I agree with people telling her to block her and not open the door for her."]}
