Y is in the same class as me\n\nOn our way back I stopped to grab some starbucks for me and R. Y asked why I didn't get anything for him. I told him I'm only supposed to tolerate him not to buy him stuff. Then R was playing her awful playlist in the car and Y was complaining about the songs. After that he started a lecture about how I need to forgive his dad and let the past go. I decided that I don't want to deal with him anymore. I stopped the car and told him to get out. He complained that he doesn't know the address because he is new here I told him I don't care. He should get out and tomorrow we can talk about him forgiving me for making him walk home in a cold weather and see how it goes. He complained for a while but then R and I made him get out and left.\n\nJ called C and he was FURIOUS. I could hear him yell at C and calling us assholes.

Your responses also show how much growing up you need to do.\n\nYou are still very young and I am sorry you had to lose you dad at such a young age. I lost my father too and I still struggle with it. \n\nHowever, taking in a 7 year old is a huge responsibility. And he wouldn't make such a huge decision to be 'annoying'.  He had his own kid as well and I promise you there was a discussion between C and J to determine what would be best for you. According to you C turned out to be a good person to live with. \n\nY did nothing to you. He just said something that you didn't want to hear.\n\nYou wanted everyone on this reddit to say you were right and now you are getting upset that it isn't what you want to hear. \n\nYou don't have to like J or Y, but you don't have to go out of your way to be a jerk. You can be kind and responsible and not put someone else in danger or do petty things like making sure to get Starbucks without him and still not like your brother.\n\nSpend this energy you have on hate and anger and try to rebuild a relationship with your brother. You might actually start to feel beter.", "YTA, how could you seriously think you would be anything but TA in this situation.

Either way, Y had absolutely nothing to do with the decision as to where you will go live and you're being a real ass to him for nothing.", "YTA. I have no words. You are an asshole. A supermassive asshole.", "YTA. Of course you're an AH. You made him walk home in the cold in an area he doesn't know because of his dad not being able to take you in as a child 10 years ago. This kid isn't to blame for that. We don't even know what J's situation was at the time. I doubt that was a decision he made lightly.\n\nGet some therapy to deal with your unresolved issues as you'll end up driving way both brothers and their kids before long.", "YTA- why are you punishing Y for something he had no control over when you were both kids?", "YTA, Y had no control over his dad's decisions and hating him for someone his dad did makes you an absolute AH.", "YTA\n\nOf course YTA. You're holding a grudge against someone who has done absolutely NOTHING to you. You can be upset at your brother all you want, but Y has done nothing to you. You had no right to abandon him in the middle of an unfamiliar city like that. That's such an awful thing to do to somebody.", "YTA you were super mean to him for no reason?!

You admit that the choice of who to take you in worked out for the best but you still punish your nephew for choices that were made by your brothers 10 years ago. Time to grow up a little.", "YtA. I don't mind being petty but this is dangerous. You kicked a kid out of the car in a city that is new to them. Anything could have happened! It's dangerous. \n\nYour siblings did not have any obligations of taking you in after your father passed. You do realize that right? They CAN  but they DONT HAVE TO take you in. Your father could have and should have prepared better, so in the future put the blame where it's supposed to be. Your father who did not have a will. And you didn't mention a mother.\n\nYtA.", "YTA\nBeing annoyed is not a valid reason to kick someone out of the car, especially without any sort of warning.\nAlso it was rude of you not to offer to buy him something.", "YTA. You are punishing Y because J knew his limits as a parent. It would have been better to air your grievances with C instead of bullying Y when you were asked to include him.\n\nI'm curious, did you get along with Y when you lived in the same city? Or did you bully him then too?", "YTA and an immature child. You are hostile to your nephew for the actions of his father? Grow up.", "YTA - The world is a seriously dangerous place, and people are kidnapped and murdered all the time for little to no reason.

Be decent person like C, he did not know was No contact with his dad but still took you in when he could have also washed his hands off the situation. Do as C does not as J would do.\n\nWhy are you emulating J\u2019s jerk behaviour ??", "YTA. J and C were both adults with their own kids when they had to consider taking you in. On top of having no parents left, they had to decide how best to care for you. Regardless of how close you were to J, you would have had no clue what his financial situation was like and if he even had the means to care for you. And based on the background provided, you still have no idea what J\u2019s life was (or is) like. \n\nYou don\u2019t even know Y, but you already hate him because J, his own father, decided to put him first. He\u2019s SUPPOSED to. That\u2019s J\u2019s kid. And you still got to be raised within your family unit, possibly even in a better environment. But you\u2019re looking at it like you got abandoned. \n\nYou\u2019re still a kid, and you don\u2019t understand just how much resourcing is required to raise a kid. It\u2019s a big ask, especially if someone already has kids. My mom had to do it for her youngest sister for the same reason, and it is not a small task. It ate all of her money, and she didn\u2019t even have kids yet. \n\nIf you want to hold this over J until the end of time, so be it. Having a conversation about it would be the more mature thing to do, but it doesn\u2019t seem like you want a relationship with J. But hating Y for it doesn\u2019t cut it. And abandoning him on the side of the road to get back at your brother (for something you consider to be similar) shows just how unethical you are. \n\nLeaving a minor in an unknown location just because he said some shit you didn\u2019t like. Seriously?!?! What if something bad happened to him?  What if J did that to R? How would you or C feel?\n\nJ has every right to be pissed you abandoned his kid. That\u2019s absolutely reckless and dangerous. The background doesn\u2019t change the fact you acted out of line.", "I understand why you kicked him out, but YTA.

Taking in a child unexpectedly is not feasible for a lot of people, especially if they already had one. C was able to take you in but that that doesn't mean that J could. At least talk to your brothers about what happened after your dad died since you definitely don't know the full story.

It sounds like you lucked out by having the opportunity to be with either brother but your brothers did the best by you that they could and and did what they needed to do for you. \n\nAlso, the passive aggressiveness towards J is rude, uncalled for, and completely immature and dangerously reckless. Anything could have happened to him. Sounds like he struck a nerve with you telling you to let go of the past. Which leads me to believe it\u2019s true. \n\nI don\u2019t recommend you let go of the past, but work through the past by talking to your brothers and a professional.
