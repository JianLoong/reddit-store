Yes it is her day but this is your body and you should be able to dress in a way that is comfortable.", "NTA - it's a shame your sister couldn't understand the issues surrounding your comfort / scars nor would she help to come up with a compromise.

If not, then it's on her to eat the cost of the dress.", "NTA \n\nShe gave you two choices and you picked one. She can't get upset that you didn't pick the option she wanted.

And rather than listen to her sisters concerns, she doubles down and goes so far as to lay her opinion over your legitimate reasons for not wanting to wear that dress.\n\nDon't give her the money for the dress, you are not being selfish your sister is. There is no situation where you should be forced to feel immensely uncomfortable all day just to stick with a shitty dress code which in the grander scheme of things *doesn't matter.*", "Your sister needs to hire models and extras for the day if she wants a perfect superficial wedding attended by identical robots. \n\nIf she wants real people there, she needs to accept that they can take decisions about how the dress and look for themselves. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

Your idea of sleeved gloves was rejected so it's just how it is.", "NTA :( I'm sorry your sister isn't being more kind, sensitive, and accommodating. The number of brides mentioned on this sub that blow up over something small and then start trying to garner support amongst the family is mind-boggling. \n\nFeels like she could use a good shaming TBH. You have a very reasonable and respectable stance, it is a-ok to try to find small ways to modify a BM dress to meet your personal needs (like an appropriately dress shrug or cardigan for instance, or having the dress tailored to add sleeves) and it's truly just sad that she'd put her wedding aesthetic over your comfort. She sounds insufferable, let's hope she gets over it after the wedding is over. \n\nIndeed, she told you that you shouldn't come, then wanted to later know why you weren't?! She's being extremely childish. Do what you feel comfortable with, whether that is sitting it out entirely or attending as a guest in something you feel ok wearing. She cannot dictate the presence of sleeves on her guests' attire.", ">She then said if I wasn\u2019t going to cooperate I just shouldn\u2019t come.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nYou suggested reasonable alternatives and were turned down. Don't go and also you never have to repay anything that you didn't order or even ask for.\n\nYour sister knew you didn't want to wear that dress. She bought it anyway.

Not you.", "wait so you aren't in the bridal party and she is telling you what to wear? heck no!\n\nNTA", "NTA and don't give it a cent for the dress it bought. You were uninvited, please make sure every relative who asks is told the truth, your sister uninvited you because her photos of her first wedding are more important than your comfort.", "NTA - brides need to understand that their wedding day is the most important day in THEIR lives, not everyone else\u2019s. If you established a boundary for something and she decided to proceed without consideration of your boundary, you are well within your right to decline the invitation. If you are worried about missing an important moment in her life, is it possible you can attend as a guest rather than a bridesmaid and choose an outfit that makes you feel comfortable? That way you can still be there in support in a way that makes you comfortable, and also able to enjoy yourself?", "NTA. A supportive sister would've decided everyone gets gloves/sleeves so that her sister can be comfortably a part of her big day", "Might get some people angry as I know how important weddings are, BUT I think having your sister present to celebrate with you AND not stressing is more important than some sleeves on a dress.

Very sorry.", "What would happen if you just came to her wedding and wore something different, or wore the dress with a jacket/sweater?", "Clearly NTA. You could have worn some sleeves that match your skin color but since she is being such an AH, she would probably not even allow this. I understand you for not wanting to go", "NTA.

It's not like you're a bridesmaid throwing a fit because you don't like the shade of pink the bride chose. You have a valid reason for wanting to cover your arms (but don't let anyone make you feel like you have to, if you're ever comfortable with showing your arms you go for it!) and you gave some very reasonable ideas for a compromise.\n\nPersonally, I'd much rather have my siblings at my wedding than stick to some uniform dress code.

NYA.", "NTA She's being a bridezilla. She can tell people in the party what she wants then to wear, but not guests outside a certain basic dress code. She's out of line.", "NTA.\n\nTough lesson for your sister to learn on telling people things like they're an ultimatum. Guaranteed she figured you'd just suck it up and deal with it, she doesn't think for one second that you'd actually not come, but it's time for her to learn that you shouldn't say things like that unless you are prepared for the other person to say \"ok\".", "NTA.

She told you not to come if you weren't willing to wear that dress, so you took her up on it. I don't understand why she's trying to dictate what you wear anyway if you're not part of the bridal party.", "NTA. However, have a couple options.\n\nA. Not go to the wedding. Definitely warranted as her own words said \u201ceither wear this or don\u2019t come\u201d. However this is only going to estrange your sister and possibly others from your family. Also once it\u2019s done you will have forever missed your sisters wedding, you won\u2019t be able to go back and change that.\n\nB. Go to the wedding but wear whatever you want (within reason) or wear the dress she wants but with sleeves. This will force your sister to either get over her original and unreasonable standard or she will have to make a scene of it to change it, not something she\u2019s going to want to do or have time for on her wedding day. You\u2019re being the bigger person because you are still going. Also, you\u2019re sister won\u2019t be *as* mad at you, won\u2019t be able to use \u201cwell you didn\u2019t come to my wedding\u201d the rest of your lives, and it\u2019s much more likely the rest of your family will support you.\n\nI\u2019d go option B in your shoes, but obviously it\u2019s totally up to you.\n\nGood on you for even asking, but next time just get the sleeves and show up in them, don\u2019t ask for permission and if there\u2019s actually a problem ask for forgiveness.\n\nOf course the third option is do exactly what she asks, but it isn\u2019t worth it.", "NTA. You may have a good reason not to want to wear short sleeves, but really, that's almost beside the point. People can have whatever rules they want for their wedding, but it works both ways - people aren't obligated to attend if they don't like the rules. Too many people think they can just use people as props.", "NTA, you have a legitimate reason to want an altered wardrobe, you offered suggestions she said \"no, just dont come then\" and you listened. She's really trying to make you the bad guy here but 100% if you went to the wedding sleeveless and people glance and keep glancing(as they will) she will say you ruined her day and took the spotlight or other bride nonsense.

Scars are out of your control and it's completely understandable that you are uncomfortable.\n\nBridezilla if you ask me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBUTTTT, you are family. So I suggest buying a pair of that transparent-ish- skin tone stockings (normally worn with heels and dresses at fancy restaurants), cutting a hole between the legs, and for your hands, and wearing it as almost a shirt under the dress. Don't even tell your sister, she will never notice if you don't tell her. You will look completely normal in pictures, scars will be hidden, and your hands will be your skin tone, so it will appear completely the same as everyone else.

Good oils are calendula, tea tree, coconut, vitamin E, lavender or the brand \"bio-oil\", just try different ones out and see how your skin reacts. \n\n\nKnow that this takes years, but it works in softening the skin, reducing keloids and evening out your skin. You can also try special cream for keloids and scars, but honestly, I use vitamin E, calendula and rosehip oil with my micro-needling derma rollers and it's the best.\n\n\nAnd once your skin has calmed down and isn't so rough anymore, get some sick ink to cover them up, it's what most of us do, and I did as well! \n\n\nBut, if you want to get into makeup, research colour theory and watch some videos about covering up bruises etc., a good orange toned base with a full coverage foundation usually works great in covering up scars.", "Pink lace gloves would match the aesthetic and be busy enough to cover any scars you\u2019re worried about.

Even after you communicated your discomfort and offered to pay for the dress you did not choose or agree to, she still insisted!  NTA!!!  I am so sorry.
