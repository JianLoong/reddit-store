So, my (F29) sister (F23) is deaf from birth, I learn from a young age ASL, and she can also read lips and answer you since she has always had speach therapy. What I realiced is that NOT ONE of my paternal side family invites her for anything. I mention no dinner partys, no birthdays, nothing. \n\nThey often pretend like I'm a single child (they only send gifts for me), they live 12 hours away so I don't mind them much, I share everything with my sister and we do not care much for them. Into the issue, my cousin is getting married and send me a plus one, I was about to decline when my sister ask me not to and to go together, so I RSVP yes. \n\nA few hours ago, my cousin called me and ask me if my husband is alergic to something, I was confused and told her no, but why was she asking, and she say \"Because You didn't fill the RSVP on My page completly\", I told her that My husband is deployed (wich he is btw) and that I was gonna go with my sister. She got quiet for a moment and later started to scream at me saying that It's rude to bring someone that will upstage the bride with an interpreter (we weren't gonna do that btw, what she didn't get I would sing for her). I cut the call, blocked her and everyone, make a long facebook post about stupid ppl and cancel my RSVP and present. \n\nMy sister is telling me that AITA for doing this, and that she wouldn't mind not going, but I'm sick of this and I don't like being part of \"the special day\" of an asshole. So AITA?\n\nEdit: I noticed that I had put my maternal side and not paternal, sorry I already correct it. I'm to blind with rage. \n\nInfo: My dad left my mom for not giving my sister away and only petiton custody of me. In my book they are all equally ignorant and deserve hell.
