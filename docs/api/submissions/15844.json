My sisters are coming along because birthday, family, stuff like that. They can\u2019t really eat much because they\u2019re super picky\u2014chicken nuggets & french fries only picky. When I said that I wanted to eat at this place (Korean BBQ & hotpot), my mom said that we can\u2019t go there because they don\u2019t have french fries or anything like that. Naturally, I am kind of annoyed because she asked me where do I want to eat for my birthday but then I have to consider where my sisters can eat at, which isn\u2019t very many. I personally wanted some flavorful Asian dishes instead of just some western food. Maybe I\u2019m being a little too selfish and petty, but am I wrong for giving my mom attitude about this?\n\nEdit: I should mention that my sisters are younger than me (16 & 7) and live at home with her so this does make it a little bit harder on my mom, understandably.", "created_utc": 1682610429, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130stjw/aita_for_having_an_attitude_about_where_i_want_to/", "score": 217, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Korean BBQ and hot pot are both delicious and hot pot is fun because you can choose what meat and veggies to cook in the broth. If I were you I\u2019d put my foot down and say that you want Korean BBQ/Hot Pot and if mom doesn\u2019t want to honor that then you will go out to eat on your own.", "I'm an only child but this is the kind of shit my wife and her sister used to argue about when choosing a restaurant for their mum when it was MIL's birthday, Mother's Day, an evening out etc.. \n\nMIL could only eat bland food (medical reasons) and SIL always tried to get us to go to a Thai or Chinese, neither of which serve anything remotely bland. She always used to say we could ask them to cook something specially for MIL, which she never enjoyed, and my wife used to argue that it was one etc day in the fucking year where we could take MIL to a British restaurant where there were a lot of bland things on the menu that she could eat and, more importantly, that she liked.

I get that your siblings are picky eaters but its your day, they can suck it up for a few hours and get chicken nuggets and fries before or after Korean bbq. \n\nI get that your youngest sister is 7 but I don't think its great to encourage such a limited diet, what happens if they have to travel and chicken nuggets is not an option? \n\nKorean bbq is personally my favorite and I'm a firm believer that you can't dislike something you've never tried.", "I had a couple of years with a couple of picky young kids. They sometimes either just had a side dish or a soda at restaurants because they understood the world doesn't revolve around them. However, in the case of a hot pot restaurant, I would have told them that it's literally dipping meat in broth, let them get steak or chicken and a broth I think they'd like, and call it good. A hot pot place is a great place to compromise and learn to expand your palate a bit if you want to! NTA.", "NTA \n\nYour mom's definition of it's your choice is different than my definition.  If she had put restrictions on the choice beforehand that would have been one thing. You select the place but it must have french fries.\n\nI'd suggest you mom looks over the menu and finds one thing your sisters can eat or your sisters depending on their age. Maybe it's rice or something else. Have them eat a bit before and then they can go have their one thing and a dessert. They need to be warned by your mom that they are expected to not make a scene and as part of a family we celebrate occasions and aren't going to get our preferences. \n\nI have nephew who when he was a child was very picky. My sister fed him before or after events, usually had something in the car if it was a longer drive.  Sometimes he would just eat bread and butter. She made sure we knew not to feel bad, she won't let him go hungry and to just not make a big deal about what he is eating or feel bad that he is there while others having more food.

It\u2019s not a dinner of your choosing if where you end up isn\u2019t what you chose.

Yes, their pickiness is annoying and a bit immature, but you can go also get Korean bbq/hotpot with anyone.

As much as I love hotpot and kbbq, I do think YTA. And I know this is going against the response I would expect here, having seen this kind of post before.\n\nIt's an asshole move to pick a restaurant where not everyone going can eat, birthday or no.\n\nI get it. I love Indian food, and my family doesn't. And my family has the birthday dinner out tradition as well. \n\nBut I would never choose to go out for my birthday dinner to an Indian food place, because I know my family doesn't eat that cuisine.\n\nBtw, a 2 in 1 kbbq/hotpot place sounds amazing.

I hope you have a nice birthday!", "NTA\n\nJust ask for $20 and you will go eat alone or with friends,  since it's not a place of your choosing but your sisters.

I was about 12 , sister 8, what do you want for birthday dinner/ where do you want to go out to eat? I said xyz, mom answered sister doesn\u2019t like xyz, ok how about abc, no sister doesn\u2019t like abc went this way about 4 rounds. No answer , next cake I want abc, no sister doesn\u2019t like abc, round 2 repeat of round one. Finally I got upset and said just ask sister where she wants to eat and what kind of cake I\u2019m allowed to have because you have told me I\u2019m not allowed anything I select. Mom answered that\u2019s an excellent idea, so from then until I moved out my parents asked my sister where she wanted to eat on my birthday and what kind of cake she wanted because sister was finicky and they didn\u2019t want her to feel left out.

I do think that giving his mother crap for it is not helpful. I say this as a person who has had to deal with family members that are picky eaters--having to deal with the complaints is annoying and I think she is just trying to keep the peace. I am not familiar with the type of restaurant that OP is talking about, but I have had the unpleasant experience of going somewhere that was expensive, and have the picky eaters basically not eat the expensive food. Add onto that having to watch the moping non-eaters kind of kills the atmosphere for everyone else. Mom just wants the family together, not have drama, and not waste money buying food that won't be eaten.\n\nI totally understand OP's frustration and they should get a chance to get the meal that they want.

I used to be super picky when I was a kid, but my grandmother discovered that I ate aged kimchi, blanched spinach and pickled perilla leaves without a fuss (I'm Korean btw) and my mom layer eased me into eating more vegetables through ssam, jjigae, stir-fries, etc. Now that I'm in my twenties, it's gotten much better, and I can eat most vegetables except for the bitter or pungent ones like minari or certain types of *namul* (foraged greens).\n\nOne of my moots (not Korean, doesn't eat red meat due to sensory issues) asked me for advice on how to make her tofu taste better & was amused to know how I sprinkle salt on my tofu and wipe off the moisture before I pan-fry them, quarter and dry eggplants for a couple of days when I want to make stir-fried eggplant, or pre-marinate all my, er, animal protein overnight in the basic marinades (depends on what I'm making, but almost always includes minced garlic and ginger) and a generous splash of rice wine. Whenever I see people complaining about how smelly meat is, I wonder if that's because they don't remove the blood properly or if they don't prep it with ginger and alcohol.\n\nI also sneak in onions and carrots into my brother's curry by grinding them in a blender with water and using it in place of water/stock, make pasta with vegetables he tolerates like garlic, tomatoes and broccoli, and even make cabbage salad with a mixture of ketchup and mayonnaise (might sound weird, but that's the most common \"dressing\" they use at our local fried chicken places if they serve cabbage salad). \n\nHaving a child who refuses to eat anything but chicken nuggets and French fries sounds nearly impossible to me.
