So what if your niece cries, she just lost her father. Crying isn\u2019t an expression of weakness or distress, it is a natural human experience.\n\nAnd the \u201cyou didn\u2019t lose a family member\u201d was cruel. You have a girlfriend who cares so deeply for you and your family that she cried at this funeral, and you make it out like she shouldn\u2019t care enough to cry.\n\nI think you\u2019re beyond apologizing - end your relationship so she can be with someone who isn\u2019t so heartless and controlling of her emotional expression.", "\"Generally I am ok with crying as long as it's not done in public.

You knew it was a potential and you took her outside and that should have been enough. You made it worse and it did not improve your niece's situation to have the knowledge that you were mean to your partner. Get some tact and deal with it.", "Lol this can\u2019t be real", "Telling someone not to cry at a funeral is a new one.  It's never okay to shame or punish someone for crying and that's absolutely what you did. Especially since you knew your girlfriend was likely to cry at a funeral yet you invited her anyway, demanded she control something that's mostly uncontrollable then physically removed her from the situation when she did exactly  what you knew she would to reprimand her. You put her in that situation and your reaction was out of line.  YTA", "YTA  for asking your gf to leave a funeral wake because she cried?   \n\n\nYes. And you knew that already.   \n\n\nSheesh.", "YTA- do you experience human emotion at all? Empathy? Are you a robot? Your poor girlfriend needs to leave you for a human being.", "YTA. \n\nWtf. You don\u2019t get to police other people\u2019s emotions. Crying at a wake and/or funeral is completely normal. \n\nStop being so damn controlling. Pathetic.", "I am very sorry for your loss. \n\nYou dragged your (ex) girlfriend outside and told her to leave, because she couldn't follow your command that she not cry. \nWhat an awful thing to do. \n\nAt times of grief, people can behave very poorly, and you did. \n\nAnd I bet that if you call her to 'apologise' you will quickly justify your awful behaviour and expect her to apologise. \n\nAs for this:\n**(I never stopped her from crying but back in my mind, I was thinking is crying really necessary?)**\n\nYes it is. Just because you don't think, believe, or do something, does not make it wrong. \n\nWar and ethnic cleansing and violent intolerance are caused by people who think otherwise.\n\nMay your niece learn to fully express her emotions, and grow up to be a woman who cries when she wants to without some repressed man shuddering in embarrassment by her side.\n\nEdit: format", "YTA\n\nPeople cry at funerals and wakes and at sad things. Like that\u2019s totally normal behavior. It\u2019s not being emotional. It\u2019s having emotions. \n\nYou could have been a chill cool supportive boyfriend who says, hey babe. Let\u2019s get out of here for a few minutes. And then honored her totally valid emotions. \n\nYou were an AH and a dick.", "YTA she is showing empathy, which is quite normal. You are the one out of line here. And oh man, you'd hate me. I am deeply emotional and I cry at the drop of a hat... even when I'm desperately trying not to. The emotion doesn't matter: happy, sad, angry, frustrated, whatever. One time, I was walking through a store, and there were some purple orchids. One of them was so incredibly perfect and beautiful that it made me cry. It did annoy me, but whatever. Luckily, my husband isn't an ahole like you, and finds it endearing. You should apologize, and also stop trying to control others' emotions.", "YTA\n\nYou knew your (ex)gf *gets very emotional at very sad times* and then got duped pissed off when she *got very emotional at very sad times*. You even kicked her out for caring and being sad for your loss.\n\nYou are bad boyfriend material.\n\nBut, while I understand her horrific pain, your SIL asking everyone not to cry a funeral wake is completely unreasonable. The SIL does want to trigger her daughter\u2019s crying after just lost her father. I understand the pain, but maybe hugging and crying together might work better.", "yes, you should. It's okay to ask her to take a breath and not cry and be stronger, but the whole, just leave thing was rude. I get that you were struggling, but clearly she feels things deeply and is highly empathetic. I think it's impossible to ensure that nobody at a funeral will cry. It's clear, though, that you don't believe or respect your GF's emotional nature and ability to be empathetic with other people's pain, and that is really the root of the issue. She knows that now, and given that it's fundamental to her nature, that may be the end of things for you and her.

Why should you?  You wouldn\u2019t mean it if you did.  What she should do is drop your ass.  \n\nCrying is just as much of an emotional release as your disgust in the act itself.\n\nYou remind me of my mother.  When I was a child, I would suddenly cry for minute reasons.  She went so far as to tell the school I had \u201cemotional problems\u201d.  What she failed to recognize, notice or even care to learn was I was molested at home and relentlessly bullied at school.  Now, since I had no one to turn to, my emotional release was to cry.\n\nIt is not wimpy for men to cry as well.  You might wanna try it sometime.  Perhaps if you did, you wouldn\u2019t be such a cold, heartless, misogynistic AH.\n\nGo ahead and delete your post because NO ONE agrees with you.", "\"Generally I am ok with crying as long as it's not done in public.\" - YTA, don't need to read past that.", "You and your SIL are the assholes. Who doesn't allow crying at a funeral? Honestly, it's okay for the niece to cry.", "YTA. You handled that horribly. \n\nFirst of all, the way you view your girlfriend's crying is just weird. You realize it's an emotional response, right? She's not doing it on purpose? Yes, it's therapeutic, but that doesn't mean she has control over it.\n\nNow, you taking her outside when she started crying at the wake was fine. That's what your SIL requested, and you informed your girlfriend of that beforehand. What's NOT fine is how you spoke to her. Asking why she was crying was just a stupid question, you knew damn well why she was crying. She's an emotional person and it's a FUNERAL. You just invalidated her feelings and made her feel bad for something that she can't easily control. You should've let her calm down outside, see if she felt up to returning, and gone from there.", "YTA - just because you don\u2019t feel deeply doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t.  Some people (usually women) are more emotional than men.  I can\u2019t believe she was the only one crying \u2026 maybe the first.  Kids are going to cry - they list their dad - it\u2019s healthy for them to cry - they shouldn\u2019t bottle it up like you do.", "YTA and so is your SIL. She\u2019s not the only one who lost someone. Not everyone s a robot", "I'm sorry for your loss but in this particular situation yes YTA. Not crying is not something that is always easy or possible at all to do, especially at a wake. You may not be able to cry and that's fine but the issue is you've been policing where your gf cries for a lot longer than this. Don't do it in public? This isn't the Victorian era. Sometimes people  need to cry. Same with your niece I understand her mum didn't want her overwrought at the ceremony but expecting absolutely nobody to cry at a funeral wake of all places for the sake of preventing a child expressing their grief is a big ask and not one that is likely to be achievable. Having said all that I am really sorry about your brother", "Yta", "YTA, people usually can't control when they cry. You seem very judgemental of your gf emotions.

It just happens. It is a physiological response designed to help you through a traumatic or upsetting situation. It is actual insanity to expect people to always be capable of controlling it.Also, on that note, there is nothing wrong with your niece crying either when she just lost a parent. It is actually incredibly harmful to her that SIL is trying to teach her not to cry. Crying is good for you. It literally releases hormones that make you feel better faster. There is nothing wrong with it, and tbh it sounds like your whole family grew up with some pretty fucked up beliefs about mental and emotional health.\n\nI honestly hope she leaves, because as of right now, you are not a healthy partner for someone to have.

I still hate crying, but I hated dissociating and being emotionally numb more.\n\nYTA, some people cry more easily and they cant help it.
