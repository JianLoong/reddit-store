You made it worse and it did not improve your niece's situation to have the knowledge that you were mean to your partner. Get some tact and deal with it.", "Lol this can\u2019t be real", "Telling someone not to cry at a funeral is a new one.  It's never okay to shame or punish someone for crying and that's absolutely what you did. Especially since you knew your girlfriend was likely to cry at a funeral yet you invited her anyway, demanded she control something that's mostly uncontrollable then physically removed her from the situation when she did exactly  what you knew she would to reprimand her. You put her in that situation and your reaction was out of line.  YTA", "YTA  for asking your gf to leave a funeral wake because she cried?   \n\n\nYes.

Pathetic.", "I am very sorry for your loss. \n\nYou dragged your (ex) girlfriend outside and told her to leave, because she couldn't follow your command that she not cry. \nWhat an awful thing to do. \n\nAt times of grief, people can behave very poorly, and you did. \n\nAnd I bet that if you call her to 'apologise' you will quickly justify your awful behaviour and expect her to apologise. \n\nAs for this:\n**(I never stopped her from crying but back in my mind, I was thinking is crying really necessary?)**\n\nYes it is. Just because you don't think, believe, or do something, does not make it wrong. \n\nWar and ethnic cleansing and violent intolerance are caused by people who think otherwise.\n\nMay your niece learn to fully express her emotions, and grow up to be a woman who cries when she wants to without some repressed man shuddering in embarrassment by her side.\n\nEdit: format", "YTA\n\nPeople cry at funerals and wakes and at sad things.

Let\u2019s get out of here for a few minutes. And then honored her totally valid emotions. \n\nYou were an AH and a dick.", "YTA she is showing empathy, which is quite normal. You are the one out of line here. And oh man, you'd hate me. I am deeply emotional and I cry at the drop of a hat... even when I'm desperately trying not to. The emotion doesn't matter: happy, sad, angry, frustrated, whatever. One time, I was walking through a store, and there were some purple orchids. One of them was so incredibly perfect and beautiful that it made me cry. It did annoy me, but whatever. Luckily, my husband isn't an ahole like you, and finds it endearing. You should apologize, and also stop trying to control others' emotions.", "YTA\n\nYou knew your (ex)gf *gets very emotional at very sad times* and then got duped pissed off when she *got very emotional at very sad times*. You even kicked her out for caring and being sad for your loss.\n\nYou are bad boyfriend material.\n\nBut, while I understand her horrific pain, your SIL asking everyone not to cry a funeral wake is completely unreasonable. The SIL does want to trigger her daughter\u2019s crying after just lost her father. I understand the pain, but maybe hugging and crying together might work better.", "yes, you should. It's okay to ask her to take a breath and not cry and be stronger, but the whole, just leave thing was rude. I get that you were struggling, but clearly she feels things deeply and is highly empathetic. I think it's impossible to ensure that nobody at a funeral will cry. It's clear, though, that you don't believe or respect your GF's emotional nature and ability to be empathetic with other people's pain, and that is really the root of the issue. She knows that now, and given that it's fundamental to her nature, that may be the end of things for you and her.

Why should you?  You wouldn\u2019t mean it if you did.  What she should do is drop your ass.  \n\nCrying is just as much of an emotional release as your disgust in the act itself.\n\nYou remind me of my mother.  When I was a child, I would suddenly cry for minute reasons.  She went so far as to tell the school I had \u201cemotional problems\u201d.  What she failed to recognize, notice or even care to learn was I was molested at home and relentlessly bullied at school.  Now, since I had no one to turn to, my emotional release was to cry.\n\nIt is not wimpy for men to cry as well.  You might wanna try it sometime.  Perhaps if you did, you wouldn\u2019t be such a cold, heartless, misogynistic AH.\n\nGo ahead and delete your post because NO ONE agrees with you.", "\"Generally I am ok with crying as long as it's not done in public.\" - YTA, don't need to read past that.", "You and your SIL are the assholes. Who doesn't allow crying at a funeral? Honestly, it's okay for the niece to cry.", "YTA. You handled that horribly. \n\nFirst of all, the way you view your girlfriend's crying is just weird. You realize it's an emotional response, right? She's not doing it on purpose? Yes, it's therapeutic, but that doesn't mean she has control over it.\n\nNow, you taking her outside when she started crying at the wake was fine. That's what your SIL requested, and you informed your girlfriend of that beforehand. What's NOT fine is how you spoke to her. Asking why she was crying was just a stupid question, you knew damn well why she was crying. She's an emotional person and it's a FUNERAL. You just invalidated her feelings and made her feel bad for something that she can't easily control. You should've let her calm down outside, see if she felt up to returning, and gone from there.", "YTA - just because you don\u2019t feel deeply doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t.  Some people (usually women) are more emotional than men.  I can\u2019t believe she was the only one crying \u2026 maybe the first.

She\u2019s not the only one who lost someone. Not everyone s a robot", "I'm sorry for your loss but in this particular situation yes YTA. Not crying is not something that is always easy or possible at all to do, especially at a wake. You may not be able to cry and that's fine but the issue is you've been policing where your gf cries for a lot longer than this. Don't do it in public? This isn't the Victorian era. Sometimes people  need to cry. Same with your niece I understand her mum didn't want her overwrought at the ceremony but expecting absolutely nobody to cry at a funeral wake of all places for the sake of preventing a child expressing their grief is a big ask and not one that is likely to be achievable.

I lost my grandfather, really my father as he is the man who raised me, when I was 15. I was told by my family not to cry. You know what that shit fucking did to me? It took me YEARS, LITERAL FUCKING YEARS, TO UNPACK THAT SHIT. I didn't cry about his death again for THREE MONTHS and it all came up on me at once, bringing me to the ground in PUBLIC. Then it took so much time and therapy and being angry and crying on my own and holding MYSELF, ALONE, to process this when I should've had support and love from the beginning. Not crying about his death was one of the biggest traumas I still carry from his death, and it was sudden and painful to go through for both my grandmother and I. I was left to try and be strong for a 75 year old when those trying to protect her were actually going against her real wishes for us to connect because we were all that was left to remember him the way we knew him. \n\nThere is not one single reason it's okay to try and keep people from crying about death. IDC what country you're from, what your religion is, what your views about therapy and emotions are, people are fucking PEOPLE and when we lose someone we love, we fucking cry.

Male prostate cancer patients, for example, tend to become more emotional when treated with medications that lower their testosterone levels. \n\n> [A]dult women have serum prolactin levels almost sixty percent above the average male. This difference may help to explain why women as a whole cry more frequently \u2026 .

I had similar feelings as OP. I just wasn't a cryer. Never held it against those who did, but just never had that emotional reaction to things. Then something truly tragic happened in my life a while back that actually caused me to cry uncontrollably for almost 20 minutes. Now, it would seem, the flood gates have opened and I'm more like my grandfather now. I'll cry during movies. If I hear a podcast that hits a certain topic. And you know what I found? It does, in fact, serve a purpose. Can't exactly put it into words, but I think that's kinda the point. I always thought it made my grandfather special that on top of everything else I loved about him, he would cry easily.

She said, \"So, it bothers you that you've been suppressing perfectly normal emotional reactions your whole life, and now that those perfectly normal emotional reactions are happening, you consider it a bad thing? I'd say it's the most normal thing that's happened to you during all of this.\" Earned every dollar that day. Will remember that the rest of my life.", "I bet more men would cry if they felt it was socially acceptable to.", "And that is kind of expected. Tears take the hormones connecting to emotions out of your body before they can get too much and cloud your brain. If people suppress crying they basically block the brains way of stopping emotional overload and thus those hormones can then cloud judgement and can lead to a short fuse and aggression. You can't control emotions but you can help prevent them from clouding your judgement and the best way to do that is crying", "I also find that because it's socially acceptable for women to discuss emotions, they tend to be more emotionally controlled. They can put words to the emotions and recognize their own emotional patterns.\n\nWhereas many men are tightly-knotted balls of repressed emotions who lash out in all directions.\n\nMen who inform you they're very logical and don't let emotions interfere with their judgment or behavior are, almost without exception, the MOST emotionally reactive.

Whilst I disagree with OP that crying is a sign of weakness and shouldn't be allowed (humans have emotions), I can't help but wonder what way her crying manifests itself. If she is the type to cry during sad movies/TV shows, there is a difference between a little sniff and a tissue wiping the eye area... and outright wailing like a banshee. I know this is going to sound bad but some cultures turn emotional moments into a \"who can be the loudest, shrillest banshee\" award... when I watch these people on TV (like news reports) it makes me feel awkward and giggly, compared to someone who is sniffly and quietly rubbing their eyes with tissues, who I feel most empathetic towards and get a bit tearful myself.", "But the person who died was OP's brother. OP needed his girlfriend to support him and be the strong one, and was asked to be strong for the family (the actual people grieving). Peripheral mourners should *not* be performatively more emotional than the inner circle close mourners. If she gets *that* emotional and is *that* fragile over things which should not affect her more than others, then she needs therapy, or to opt out of attending emotional events. OP has the right to put themself first when the person who died is their own flesh and blood. In other scenarios, I agree OP has no right to police her crying and make her feel inadequate for showing emotion, but there is a time and place for this. If OP's girlfriend is a performative wailing banshee when she cries, then OP's frustrations are valid because literally the only times where being a performative wailing banshee is if you witness someone being murdered in front of you, you're witnessing a bomb being dropped around you or a parent has been told that their child has a terminal illness and will die. OP said his brother died of cancer, which means they knew he was dying and OP had to watch his beloved brother die a painful and long death. The girlfriend had ample time to see a therapist, find out ways to be supportive and prepare herself for being strong for the funeral. It's one day... one day the family needed her to be strong for them. She couldn't even do that, for her grieving boyfriend and a grieving child.", "I am jealous that my parents have never forbade me to be sad. Would have saved me a lot of tears in my life.", "Yes they can. While overall it seems like the OP has an issue with not showing sadness, and definitely needs to work on that, in this case girlfriend crying was making it about her. It wasn't her brother, her husband, her father that died. Her role was to be supportive of the family. She should have held the crying in, or left and calmed down outside if she couldn't hold it in.

Be ok with crying, don't allow the toxic masculinity to make it uncomfortable and therefore questionable.

If she felt she needed a cry, she should have gone to the bathroom, shed a few tears, wiped her eyes so it wasn't obvious she had been crying, then go back to be the shoulder to cry on for others.

And I'm thankful that my parents didn't make me.  The downside is that I ended up missing the whole funeral too and I think, in my case, it would have probably helped me to go with the casket closed, because I think I really just repressed everything and didn't deal with my feelings for years and part of that was because it just felt so surreal, there was no closure, and it was just like the times she was in hospital on a ward that didn't allow kids to visit so it let me not face up that she was actually gone.
