It's a good custom to maintain.  \n\nWhen your children are older, if they say they want to do something different, listen to them and be willing to negotiate - whether it's to include one of their friends or sweethearts, go to grandma's, or let one of them go somewhere else for Christmas without making a fuss.", "NTA. Christmas morning alone with the immediate family is the best.", "My daughter also started her own Christmas tradition with her family. It was tough at first, but ultimately we had to understand she has her family now and it\u2019s their turn to make some traditions. That\u2019s a really hard thing for some parents to accept. Have patience but be firm. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - I have a similar rule, we are always home on Christmas and we do our traditions. Not anyone else\u2019s. Ours. (We don\u2019t do Santa).", "NTA. You have every right to have your own family traditions. My family does the family gift unwrapping Xmas eve (we all live within 25 minutes of each other), and Christmas morning is for the Santa presents in each kids home.", "Nope!  Good for you for setting aside time for just your household.  Your mother already had her turn when you were little, now it is your turn and can do it anyway you want.  Maybe tell her you could always take a vacation at that time of year or she can take what she gets and be content if she can\u2019t be happy.  Good luck", "Nta. Keep that firewall up.", "Nta.  Did your mom expect you to wait until she got there for yr kids to open presents?  I can't imagine my child waiting for anyone to rip that wrapping.  \ud83d\ude06", "NTA\n\n My brothers ad I with my mom and dad always open the presents here alone with all of us as soon as everyone is awake. Then we always have the same meetup time to go to a kind of party where everyone exhanges their gifts with everyone else. My parents fathers and mothers dont make any of it any sort of big deal we just know that we'll all get together and see everyone later. Honestly a crazy mindset to even have on her side.", "NTA. Christmas morning was for our household, if we had guest staying over then of course I\u2019d include them but she lives 20 minutes away that\u2019s not an out of town guest who would otherwise be alone. You get what you get and you don\u2019t throw a fit, she still gets Christmas with them so it is what it is.", "Does your mom live alone? Depending how you feel about Christmas, but for lots of people once your kids are all grown up and gone,  it gets pretty lonely.", "NTA - just because your grandparents were there Christmas morning, doesn\u2019t mean you are obligated to do the same.

My parents felt the same way you do - that Christmas morning is for Mom, Dad, and the kids. Both sets of grandparents were perfectly fine with coming by either later in the day or on Christmas Eve. Please continue to stick to this very reasonable boundary!", "NTA! As a parent, to be willing to set boundaries is the job. You are doing it right. Your kids are little now, it's important for them to have a set time of fun and celebration that's also stress free. You are doing that right as well. Kids that have these breaks built into the holiday season are less likely to have that melt down moment due to overstimulation. Keep doing what you're doing!", "NTA. She chose to share that moment. You do not.  I don\u2019t either.  That moment is mine.  It goes so quickly before they stop believing and then stop being little.  I\u2019ll\nBe selfish when it come to my kids few short years I get of the magic.", "You have every right to have Christmas with just your immediate family. That\u2019s absolutely normal.

Not all undesirable behavior is gaslighting.", "NTA\n\nWhen people get married, they become their own family. If this couple chooses, they add children to this family.

You know what? That\u2019s not your problem. \n\nYou focus on your growing family and what works best for you and your wife. For the record, your mother is the selfish one.

And then we had to wait until everything was cleared and dishes were done and everyone was sitting in the lounge to open one present at a time by the designated \u201cSanta\u201d. As an adult I can see why they did it, to extend the Christmas magic, go to church in the morning, etc etc but as a child it was torture.", "Nope my dad and sister still live with her", "No, she\u2019s a good grandmother and we have a good relationship usually.
