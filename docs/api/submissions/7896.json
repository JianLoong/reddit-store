They're staying in the guests room. So far we've been on the same page concerning all things except the decorative pillows. My wife loves adding decorative pillows on beds, and she did the same with the guests bedroom. She did it to make the room look better and also it's her preference.\n\n\nShe came to me complaining about seeing the decorative pillows in the guests room being put on the floor and not being put on bed during the day. I went to talk with my brother and he explained that SIL was tired of having to move the (7 pillows in total) pillows before using tthe bed. I explained how my wife finds this disrespectful but He thought it was no big deal and that my wife was being a little too obssessed especially since SIL is pregnant and can't put the pillows back every time. We had a fight and I ended up calling him & SIL \"rude guests\" because of it. He & SIL got offended and there was tension in the house over it.\n\n\nMy wife isn't speaking to them, and they aren't speaking to me. AITA?\n\nMaybe my wife overreacted, Maybe I shouldnt have called them that but it is what it is so.", "created_utc": 1674308712, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hrl12/aita_for_calling_my_brother_sil_rude_guests_for/", "score": 9623, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Rude asf that your wife is invading their space. My brother in law lived with us recently. For 6-7 months. That was his room and bathroom while he lived with us. \nThey didn't knock a hole in the wall, break the bed or go in carrying cans of paint. They're allowed to have privacy and not everyone is \"pillow people\". But I might be biased. I hate those pillows and wouldn't be moving them back and forth either.", "YTA.

Decorative pillows look bad, take up space, and are generally liked by people with bad taste who don't know how to make and decorate a bed properly. They're just filler used by amateurs.", "Dude you are fighting with your BROTHER, your own flesh and blood, over FUCKING PILLOWS.  Take a step back and look how ridiculous you and especially your wife are being.\n\nObviously your brother and SIL are going through a hard time, and she is pregnant on top of it.  And you give them shelter and then kick them when they are down over... FUCKING PILLOWS.\n\nAnd to top it off it sounds like its only bothering your wife and you are just defending her, so she doesn't shit on you too.  That makes you even more of an asshole for fighting over something you don't even really care about.\n\nYTA.  And your wife is worse than an asshole.", "YTA, what a stupid hill to die on.

And that\u2019s on her.", "YTA, first, there is no reason for you or your wife to go into the guest bedroom every day.\nSecond, decorative pillows are not practical, and you can 100% be sure, i would take them of the bed one time, and never put them back.", "YTA   Find a big plastic bag for the pillows and store them in the garage or somewhere else (not in the guest room closet) while they are there.", "YTA ! A major one. Your wife too.", "YTA and your wife is being ridiculous. Decorative pillows are nice, but having to move that many pillows every day is excessive.", "Seven???

Decorative pillows are not it.", "YTA-A guest room should be inviting and also comfortable for the guests.  You can have aesthetics but if a guest room is really for the guests to use, it should be user-friendly. I love pillows but I\u2019d never get bent if I have a guest is not using them. It should be at their comfort.  \n\nNow, if you and your wife are truly bent about this, your wife could volunteer to make the bed for them each time or you all could simply move the pillows to a closet while they stay there.

This is the stupidest hill to die on.  Why is your wife snooping in your brothers room to see if the pillows are in the bed or not?", "Are they using the pillows at night? If not, why not just keep them separate (in cupboard) for sometime. That's a lot of pillows btw.", "Decorative pillows are a pain in the and I wish decorators would stop pushing them. Can't use any furniture until you remove them. So effing stupid.", "YTA. Man, I wish I had problems like this lol. GTFO with your stupid pillows. Put them in a closet and put them back out when your guests leave. Your wife's obsession with ridiculous things like this is her problem, not your guests'.", "YTA, seriously I wish my life was rolling this smoothly that I could dedicate energy to something this petty, to be clear I still wouldn\u2019t,  but get a grip, if you need a kidney, these are your people.", "YTA. They are your guests. Make them comfortable in your home. \n\nAlso, decorative pillows are meant to be moved.

It's the guest room. Do they have to keep up the pillow preferences of your wife? That is so ridiculous. Your wife sounds like a control freak. She should get over herself and treat guests like guests not like slaves to her pillow preferences.\n\nYou should not be calling them rude guests, but call your wife a rude host.", "YTA. You and your wife must have a lot of time on your hands to spend so much time on such a trivial issue.", "YTA. Don\u2019t you 2 have more important things to worry about?", "YTA. The bed is for sleeping on. What's the point of having to take them off and put them back on every single night? If they were staying for one night, yeah, it's expected that they'd put then back. But not if they've moved in for a bit. You and wife are being precious over pillows for no reason. They're not being rude guests, you're bad hosts", "So, let me get this straight: your SIL and brother are being harangued because they want to keep the decorative pillows from getting soiled, and because they're not putting them back every single time your wife is having an apeshit fit? I get it it's your house and your rules, but this is one strange hill to die on.\n\nYTA!", "YTA that\u2019s such a ridiculously petty thing to be annoyed about.

Whilst they stay in the room they are allowed to rearrange the fucking pillows without begging for permission. The room is being used functionally, it is not a showroom.\n\nTell your wife to keep her nose out of people's bedrooms. Foes she really not have better things to worry about? I suspect your wife hates your brother and SIL and just wants any reason to complain. Ordering people around over cushions is being a shitty host. \n\nAs long as the pillows and furnishings are not being damaged, they have a right to do what they want whilst staying there.", "YTA...you're rude hosts. You invaded your guests' privacy and compromised their comfort over throw pillows. Surely you have more going on in life.", "Yea you & the wife may be TA on this. More so her than you. \n\nIf your guests don\u2019t want to use them, why should they be forced to? I get seeing them in the floor can be off putting, but they can easily go in a chair or closet til they leave. They\u2019re not entitled or should be forced to use them. Not to sound like a AH, but is your wife actually turning the room down every morning like a hotel? If not, let your guests live and enjoy the space and time. \n\nYou\u2019re only a AH because you did the right thing by standing by your wife. Question: how do YOU feel about the pillows and the situation because you never stated your opinion on it. \n\nP.S. I love decorative pillows like the next man but I also can see how the novelty can wear off after awhile. Think the situation will blow over once cooler heads prevail. Tel SIS congratulations on the pregnancy!", "YTA it\u2019s fine when no one is using it but the pillow situation but is a real pain if you have to sleep there.

They\u2019re pillows. 7 Decorative pillows having to get moved on and off the bed EVERY damn day is honestly excessive.

They are decorative pillows ffs. You seem the type of person to offer help (housing) and then hold it over everyone\u2019s head.", "YTA. Man, talk about picking a fight where none was required. Your GUESTS don\u2019t like the decorative pillows. As HOST, you put them away, and when your GUESTS leave, you put them back. Jeez Louise.", "YTA. They\u2019re your guests.

Also why is your wife snooping in their room", "YTA. Why is your wife going in the room they're using while they're using it? And 7 decorative pillows? That's just an excessive amount of waste. They're only there to be looked at which isn't ideal when the room is actually being used. If she doesn't want the pillows on the floor then she should probably find some kind of decorative box to put them in when not is use. Or toss the damn things", "YTA. Decorative pillows are not comfortable to sleep with. So of course when going to bed they have to be put somewhere. Your wife should grow up. She is way overreacting about this and so are you.
