The other is to convey that the new shiny body is better and the old one needed to go.

For example, trigger warnings for food are actually harmful, as treating food as something we need to avoid just reinforce the eating disorder (though discussions of actual eating disorders should still have warnings). \n\nWeight loss disucssions/pictures, are tricky, because they can be triggering, but they are alone part of daily life and are often something positive and tone celebrated. It's not like you can (or should) throw your coworker in a closet for coming into work having lose some weight. And making more nutritious choices and becoming more active is a great thing. Trigger warnings stop being reasonable when they call for people to avoid discussing daily life (another reason trigger warnings for food should not be used). \n\nSo you'd be an AH if you were posting about starving yourself or something, as EDs are a common trigger, but posting healthy pictures of yourself is just life and if your friend has a problem she needs to figure it out in her end.
