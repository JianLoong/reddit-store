Also anyone that is not supportive or happy for your success overcoming obesity should not be in your life at all.", "NTA  \nYour weight loss has been an on-going process for years.  Absolutely not a surprise that you would post photos, it was on her to mute or unfollow you long ago if she is struggling with an ED and found these types of messages triggering.", "Congratulations on the weight loss.  Block Len.  Celebrate your success as you see fit.  NTA", "NTA - you're allowed to be proud of your weight loss in a private setting. Maybe, in some cases this is an issue for people with ED (I have no empirical data), but I can't imagine it's in any way worse or comparable to the millions of gym advertisement or health food ads that are seen every day.", "NTA. \"YOU CANT SHOW THAT YOURE DOING BETTER THAN ME.

If you're going to make a post on a semi-public forum (that doesn't expect such things in general) about, say, your recovery from sexual assault, then, sure, warning people upfront that they're going to read uncomfortable content is being respectful. When a friend of mine had to have multiple major abdominal surgeries after a section of his large intestine exploded, I think it was entirely appropriate that he had content warning and spoiler boxes in front of his recovery photos.\n\nA before and after photo celebrating your success in reaching health goals (whether that's weight loss or muscle gain or anything of that nature) does not warrant a content warning. If \"Len\" feels that every such image is emotionally disturbing to her, she should probably consider limiting her exposure to Facebook (and, indeed, to much of the Internet). The unfollow button is *right there*. EDs are serious business, but this isn't about her eating disorder, it's about her attention-seeking behavior.\n\nYou're fine. And congratulations on what you've achieved! Don't let anyone else bring down your accomplishment.", "NTA. This is your personal page.

If she had asked you to put a trigger warning, you said no and she was just like okay then it would be N-A-H but her getting worked up and involving other people rather than just unfollowing you makes her an AH. \n\nThat being said what Ive heard from the ED community that they would prefer if people put trigger warnings or did that black screen thing before posting weight loss/diet posts because it can be very triggering. Not saying you should or have to do that, but just passing that info along", "Nta - a trigger warning couldn\u2019t hurt - anorexia kills 1/4 of those diagnosed so as far as mental health disorders go it\u2019s pretty serious\u2026 but it also isn\u2019t something she gets to demand there\u2019s that \u201csee less posts like this\u201d option.
