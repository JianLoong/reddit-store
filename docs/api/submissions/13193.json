He lives about 5 minutes farther from work than I do, so while it is an inconvenience he has offered to give me $10 a day for gas, which I refused because it was too much money. We live in a rural area where public transportation isn\u2019t an option.\n\nNow there\u2019s a few reasons I don\u2019t want to keep giving him a ride every single day. First and foremost, it\u2019s really not my fault he\u2019s a drunk and got a dui(crap reason, but still). Also he\u2019s like a two-pack-a-day smoker, and he smells TERRIBLE. I drive a nice, fairly new truck and take pride in keeping it in good shape. Now I just smell fucking cigarettes for like 24 hours after he\u2019s been in my truck, and I can\u2019t stand it. On top of that he\u2019s told me before that his wife just sits at home and drinks all day(surprise surprise) so I feel like she should just come pick him up, as she\u2019s already dropping him off at work. On top of all that we have nothing in common and it\u2019s always an awkward 15 minute ride to his house. \n\nSo I guess I\u2019m here because I feel like I\u2019m 100% an AH if I tell him to find another ride home over a few minor inconveniences.. am I?", "created_utc": 1679780502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12206po/wibta_if_i_told_a_coworker_i_dont_want_to_give/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If his wife is an alcoholic and can't, and there's nobody he can make an ongoing arrangement with and he doesn't want to stop smoking, that's not your responsibility. \n\nI understand wanting to be kind. At the same time, you can't just give him a lift every day when it's having such negative effects on you. Smoking is honestly so gross I'd have never agreed to give a lift to begin with. He was driving drunk and that's really not okay. These are his own consequences. The kind thing to do is to be honest and have boundaries for yourself.

It is perfectly reasonable not to want your new truck to smell like an ashtray. As for getting out of it, you have two main options\n\n**1. Use a cover story**\n\nObviously, lying isn't great, but if you want to minimize any hard feelings or awkwardness, it might be the best option. A few ideas could be that your schedule is more unpredictable, you have errands to run after work, a vaguely-stated schedule change with a bunch of \"increased obligations,\" etc. Since this is a work relationship, it can sometimes be better to use a specific reason.\n\n**2. Tell the (kind) truth**\n\nTelling the truth is also a perfectly good option, as long as you're nice about it. Just kindly let your coworker know that you can't give them rides anymore because the smell of cigarettes is penetrating into your car (if you want to be specific) or that you can't give them any more rides because it makes it harder to do things after work without advance planning (if you want to be vague)\n\nFYI, I mostly summarized [this](https://www.askamanager.org/2017/06/how-can-i-get-out-of-chauffeuring-my-coworker-everywhere.html) post from Ask A Manager, so definitely go give it a look", "Also, this is another reason why there should be decent public transport everywhere. Car culture hurts everybody.", "A lot of states allow for a restricted license where he'd be able to drive to and from work, as well as to AA meetings and any appointments he'd have with his caseworker. Now, a cavoite is that many of those states also require an interlock device to be installed in any vehicle that's in his name for a period of time, so his wife might be boned since she's staying at home drinking all day and wouldn't be able to use any vehicles where both names are on the title as the interlock would prevent the car from starting, but then again she probably shouldn't be driving to begin with...\n\nYou're NTA, he got himself into this mess, he can get himself out of it...", "OP please don\u2019t listen to this comment.

As the daughter of an alcoholic who grew up watching what felt like millions of enablers saving my dad from his own consequences, you do NOT need to do something that makes you uncomfortable for this person.
