He lives in the same direction I do, so he\u2019s asked for rides home a few days in a row and I\u2019ve been helping out. He lives about 5 minutes farther from work than I do, so while it is an inconvenience he has offered to give me $10 a day for gas, which I refused because it was too much money. We live in a rural area where public transportation isn\u2019t an option.\n\nNow there\u2019s a few reasons I don\u2019t want to keep giving him a ride every single day. First and foremost, it\u2019s really not my fault he\u2019s a drunk and got a dui(crap reason, but still). Also he\u2019s like a two-pack-a-day smoker, and he smells TERRIBLE. I drive a nice, fairly new truck and take pride in keeping it in good shape. Now I just smell fucking cigarettes for like 24 hours after he\u2019s been in my truck, and I can\u2019t stand it. On top of that he\u2019s told me before that his wife just sits at home and drinks all day(surprise surprise) so I feel like she should just come pick him up, as she\u2019s already dropping him off at work. On top of all that we have nothing in common and it\u2019s always an awkward 15 minute ride to his house. \n\nSo I guess I\u2019m here because I feel like I\u2019m 100% an AH if I tell him to find another ride home over a few minor inconveniences.. am I?", "created_utc": 1679780502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12206po/wibta_if_i_told_a_coworker_i_dont_want_to_give/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s really not a big deal to give him a ride home, although the smoke smell is getting to me at this point. However, he makes it sound like he expects rides all the way until he gets his license back, which is like a year or 18 months or something insane. I don\u2019t mind helping here or there but I just feel like the guy needs to take some sort of responsibility and come up with a solution instead of inconveniencing me for the next year of my life.", "But it STILL isn't your problem!

My assertion NAH, but missed opportunity for a free upgrade/new tires/etc.", "His wife is drinking all day, she should not be driving.", "but she doesn\u2019t NEED to be drinking all day, either. Get what I\u2019m saying? She could easily put the beer down and come pick him up", "If she's home *every day*, drinking *all day*, that's *alcoholism* and most people can't just stop being addicted on a dime. Should she? Of course. But can she?\n\nIf he asks her to drive him to and from work, it's way more likely that she'll chose to do so by driving drunk and not by quitting drinking."]}
