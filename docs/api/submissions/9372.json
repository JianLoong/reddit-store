I became friends with some people in the program most of which are men, but my closest friend currently is a girl (17F) as we just clicked during frosh and some group projects we did.\n\nI have not really been friends with many girls before as I am usually shy so idk if this would be inappropriate to ask. With her I no longer feel shy though as she feels familiar and we have many common interests.\n\nShe is however very feminine in the way she dresses, comes to class with makeup, nails, sometimes heels etc, and while she mostly talks about the same things every one else does, sometimes she will talk about women's fashion and girl topics. It used to be awkward but I do not mind it anymore when it is between us.\n\nHowever when I bring her along when we hang with our primary friend circle (which are more my friends than hers), she always dresses up and sometimes will bring up girl topics during conversation, usually indirectly and somewhat related to what everyone else is talking about. Usually it is fashion, but once she brought up periods. This embarrasses me somewhat, and I feel like the others might judge me for being friends with her.\n\nI was thinking of gently asking her to not bring up those topics when with our other friends, which would not be such a big issue as we mostly talk about school and nerdy topics anyway most of the time. I considered also asking her to not overdress but I feel like that might come off rude and hurt her feelings so I probably will not do that.\n\nSo WIBTA for asking her to avoid girly topics? She has been a great friend to have in college so I do not want to risk making her feel bad in any way, but we talk freely about things.\n\nEDIT: Got it, I will not tell her that which was what I assumed was more likely. I do not mind talking about these things with her, I was just concerned the other friends might more than anything. She is my closer friend and the others are mostly people we do activities with.", "created_utc": 1675784552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w4xts/wibta_for_telling_my_friend_to_avoid_girl_topics/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's a feminine person, and she has feminine interests. If you don't like it, don't be friends with her, but you don't get to cherry pick or dictate how people show up just to make you more comfortable. I would ask yourself why feminine topics in front of your masculine friends makes you uncomfortable - it feels very \"unknown internalized misogyny\" to me.", "YWBTA\nGrow up. Women are half the population and the fact that you're all embarrassed by the word \"period\" means that you really need to learn about it.", "Yes, you would be TA. \n\nI can sense you are about to get absolutely raked over the coals by this subreddit. I want to be really gentle here, hoping you'll actually listen. \n\nWhy are you getting embarrassed when your awesome friend is just totally being herself? Why do you feel the proper response is to tell her some version of \"You aren't cool here, please pretend to be something you're not so that I'm not embarrassed by you.\" I know that's not what it sounds like in your head, but that's totally the only thing she'll hear, and she's right to hear it!\n\nRather than seeking to change her to save yourself embarrassed, I'd challenge your embarrassment. Why does it make you uncomfortable, *really*. What's making you prioritize your comfort over your awesome friend? Why does her talking about \"girly things\" *really* bother you so much? \n\nI know you're young, but these things will *super* matter later in life, whether you have lady friends or coworkers, or especially if you marry or date women, or have a daughter, or have close friends who have daughters. Talking about \"girly things\" *should not* be uncomfortable, and I highly encourage you to fall into it and get comfortable with it. You're in danger of chasing off your awesome friend. But you have a chance here to really grow as a person.", "YWBTA.\n\nIf you're old enough to be talking about college, you are old enough to handle hearing about periods.", "YTA - youre going to be read for filth for this post. \n\n*grabs popcorn*\n\nYou have a lot of maturing to do if a dress and hearing about a period makes you that uncomfortable", "sounds like someone is embarassed to be friends with a girl  \n\n\nYWBTA for asking her to change herself just to avoid your own embarassment,   \n\n\nit is a good thing to have female and male friends if your male friends give you crap for it, they are not your friends", "YTA. Nobody asks you not to talk about \"man things\" or dress a little more feminine around women. Why? \nThink...\nThink...\nThink...\nBecause you're a guy.\nBecause they aren't sexist jerks.\nBecause nobody has the right to ask anyone else to CHANGE for their own comfort. \n\nI'm curious about why you don't want anything feminine around you & that you think it makes anyone else uncomfortable. Maybe you need a therapist who deals in sexuality self discovery.", "Yta. You call this girl a great friend, but have you considered that you are being a bad one?\n\nThere is nothing embarrassing about dressing nicely, or talking about girly things, or fashion. I think you are just projecting your insecurities from being shy. She is willing to talk about things that don't 100% align with the nerdy stuff you talk about, becauae that is how friend groups work. It isnt embarrassing, its very normal. You all have different interests and should be able to share them with your friends.\n\nIf you are worried about other people judging you for being friends with then you need to ask yourself: is this an actual problem or am I just being insecure, if itnis a problem then are those good people who you should be friends with, and why do you think their approval is so important to you in the first place.", "YWBTA \n\nStop thinking she needs to modify herself and make herself smaller and different to fit in with the menfolk.\n\nYou\u2019re being kinda sexist in the way you think.", "YWBTA. I know you\u2019re 17 so you have lots to learn. But you can\u2019t ask someone to change who they are to make you more comfortable.", "YWBTA. first of all there is no such thing as girl topics, because men can like fashion, for example. So cut the crap right there. Second, this:\n\n>I have not really been friends with many girls before as I am usually shy \n\nyou haven't been friends with girls, and now you want to damage your relationship because of what your friends MIGHT think of you?? like wtf\n\n>I considered also asking her not to overdress, but I feel like that might come off rude \n\nYES, IT WOULD BE RUDE. what is the problem of her wearing makeup up and dresses? If it bothers you so much, stop being her friend. She deserves better than an awkward, rude, and slightly sexist friend.", "YTA. Women exist. Periods exist. Makeup and feminine clothes exist. You need to learn how to co-exist with them rather than asking someone to change who they are for you.", "YTA, I would take the opportunity to learn from her instead of shut her down. If you listen carefully you might learn enough to have a functional adult relationship in the future.", "YWBTA \n\nyou don\u2019t get to decide what other people wear. also, if your friends judge you, just for being friends with a feminine girl, then they aren\u2019t good friends.", "YWBTA. You don\u2019t control your friend. She\u2019s a total separate being with her own ability to engage with others. \n\nShe\u2019s not an extension of you. \n\nWhat she does/says is not about you.", "I'm glad you're asking! YWBTA for sure! \n\nDo not lose your friend over this. Do not make her feel self-conscious. Your friends are capable of changing the subject if they're uncomfortable. Periods are not unspeakable things, but part of the experience of half the population. You're close enough to being an adult now that you need to learn to handle those kinds of subjects without embarrassment. \n\nHow she dresses is none of your business. She's met your friend group, she knows the vibe, and this is how she wants to dress for it. You would be incredibly rude asking her to change.\n\nYour worries about being judged for being her friend make you sound really, really insecure. You're not in middle school anymore. You're in college. Be friends with whomever you like.\n\nYou've got a great new friend. Do not let your insecurities screw this up.", "YWBTA\n\nI'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're trying to come from a good place on this but are just lacking critical context about women in STEM fields.\n\nWe're constantly given the message that the only way to succeed in these fields is to tone down our femininity and be \"one of the guys.\" To not \"be like other girls.\" And that's not even touching on the way menstruation is stigmatized even outside of male-dominated fields.\n\nYour friend? Doesn't need to hear it from you, too. Not if you actually want to be her friend.", "YWBTA. She should not have to conform to the male perspective here. It\u2019s disappointing to hear someone say that she should change who she is simply because they are in a male field. This is the kind of thinking which keeps women out.", "Yup, YWBTA I'll be checking in again later to read more comments lol  \nAlso, I grew up liking a lot of things that were considered \"boy\" interests and called a \"Tomboy\" and then made fun of when I wanted to do things like wear heels because it \"didn't suit my personality\".\n\nI am normally hopeful that we are moving past that kind of crap, but then I read this, and I realize that we have a long way to go still.", "YTA Why are you judging her for how she chooses to present herself? It's not obnoxious or offensive, she just likes to look pretty. It doesn't affect anyone. And asking her to only talk about male stuff? Dude. She is a girl and she is also a person with her own interests, that you happen to consider feminine. Because fashion is not a female only interest. I swear if one of my male friends made a fuss about me mentioning clothes or even periods they would be told off. It's really not a big deal or something to be secretive about. Hell I do my own nails too and many of the compliments I get on my nails are from men. You sound insecure as hell and you're projecting it onto her. Work on your confidence, she has nothing to do with you being embarrassed, insecure and immature.", "Wtf\u2026 yta obviously no explanation needed", "YWBTA. Speaking from experience, women in engineering are treated very differently in school/professional settings. The way she presents herself has absolutely nothing to do with you and we as a society need to be less concerned with how women dress. As for the topics she brings up, I think it only embarrasses you because of your misogyny. Let\u2019s normalize period talk and not shame women for being interested in traditionally feminine things.", "YWBTA \n\nYou're basically asking if it would be okay to ask her to stop talking about things that interest her. \n\nYou would be the ultimate Asshole if you actually asked her to change the way she dresses too....", "YWBTA. I get that teenagers and you have a lot of growing up to do, but I doubt she'd want to stay friends with you if you told her that. \n\nShe's not less than for being into \"feminine things\". And she doesn't deserve for you to make her feel that way.", "YTA and you will be single for many years if you continue this mindset. This is peak incel shit.", "YWBTA if you ask her to avoid women's topics. She can decide what she wants to socially present for herself.\n\nI'm sure you are aware of the \"women in STEM\" issue. And women-who-act-more-like-men in STEM isn't the solution.", "Yes YWBTA YTA\n\nYour friend embarrasses you around your male friends. You're not a good friend. \n\nWhy is her behavior OK when other men aren't present?\n\nIs your masculinity in danger because you have a friend who's a girl and *gasps* talks about things that interest her!? In an attempt to join in on the conversation?!!! The horror!!!", "If your friends have a problem with a girl acting like a girl, they\u2019re not ever going to spend much time around girls. Sounds like a great recipe for loneliness.", "YTA. Grow up. She\u2019s your closest friend (and a great one you mentioned). Yet you\u2019re embarrassed when she talks about normal stuff in her life. Why do you care what others think of your friendship?\n\nYou even said she mostly talks about what the other people are talking about. So it\u2019s not like she\u2019s dominating the conversation talking about heels and periods. Sounds like she\u2019s helped you come out of your shell a bit and you should be grateful. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a benefit having a bit of female perspective and energy around and she can choose how she presents herself / behaves. Stuff what other people MIGHT think, a good friend will stick by. Hopefully they appreciate her around.", "YWBTA (but a compassionate YWBTA, because I know you're 17 and anxious.) You gotta get over being ashamed of your friend, dude. Relax and enjoy young adulthood/late teenagerhood, where your friends can talk about dresses sometimes and it literally doesn't matter at all. Agonizing over how your friends feel about cooties is something you can put away.\n\nHaving read your edit, I know you're not going to tell your friend to police her existence. But I think you could stand to sit with this and process. Please consider how it would make your friend feel to be told that, as a woman in an extremely male field, she is barred from talking about regular daily life with her peers. You mentioned period squeamishness, sure, but you seem to be just as worried about \"women's fashion and girl topics,\" the fact that she shows up in makeup, etc. Bud, she's a classmate talking about her daily life and putting on clothes in the morning, just like you're presumably allowed to do. Don't make her feel like a foreigner.\n\nEDIT: typo", "YTA she deserves a better friend who isnt ashamed of her just bc she's a girl.", "YTA\n\nNice sexism you're showing there. Being a woman in a male dominated program is tough enough, don't make it worst.", "YTA\n\nShe can dress however she wants to fucking dress. Have you thought that maybe she doesn't do it for you, but rather herself. \n\nAlso, she can talk about what she is interested in. If you can't just suck it up, and listen to her interests, then stop being friends. \n\nYou have alot of growing up to do.", "I like how he calls his male friends \u201cmen\u201d and his friend and other women \u201cgirls\u201d. Sounds like you and your friends are still boys", "YTA. You want a woman to change herself to make the man folk comfortable. Gross.", "Yta I expect you'd complain if she wore clothing that wasn't feminine enough too. Also oh no periods! Do men not care about fashion at all?", "Yta, you have a lot of growing up to do. If you can't talk about anything other than your own interests, you have no business calling her your friend", "YTA.  You want her to change herself for the comfort of \"the guys.\"  How would you NOT be in the wrong?\n\nJust to add... there's no such thing as \"girl topics.\"  Women are people.  Topics are not gendered.  Men really need to get over discomfort about periods and... fashion.", "YWBTA probably. If she's just talking about fashion or makeup or whatever, just let her be her! Unless she's talking about personal stuff that would make most people uncomfortable (Periods, underboob sweat, etc) she's not doing anything wrong. As for how she dresses, dude. She likes to look nice! Thats fine!", "YWBTA\n\nGood for your for asking though. \n\nThere are a lot of stereotypes around engineers being awkward -- having a \"regular\" girl in your group will actually probably be really helpful.", "YTA If you think your classmates will look down on their female peer for being a female peer, you challenge THE SEXISTS, not further bully the victim into appeasing the sexists.", "YWBTA. \n\nI remember my first semester of studying history at my university. Most people going for the seminars about medieval topics were men. I remember getting in the room, finding a seat and sitting down. They stared at me because I didn\u2019t look like a smart girl\u2122\ufe0f. I wore skinny jeans, a blouse and make-up. My shoes had heels, too. Back home everyone knew me and knew about my interest for history, I was regarded as one of the smartest people in our grade. And you know what? I still dressed up girly, I even partied with my girl friends on the weekends and shockingly I also experience periods and loved to talk about my favorite nail polish colors, even in front of guys. They didn\u2018t care by the way, they even showed interest just as I showed interest in what they liked. In uni, nobody knew me of course. I remember how the guys looked at me like I was just some dumb bimbo who got into the history major on accident. I remembered how they looked at the other girls in the room and also how they stared with down right confusement when we actually participated in class. \n\nEdit: I hadn\u2019t felt so bad about myself since boys got into the \u201eI hate girls\u201c-phase in kindergarten. That betrayal hit so hard. \n\nIf you want to be friends with her because you like her and you have a good time hanging out you have to accept all of her, even the parts of her personality that aren\u2019t directly entertaining or benefiting you. I think you would GREATLY benefit from having an unapologetically female friend. Half of this world is unapologetically female and you can\u2019t hide from that. \n\nI\u2018m not saying you have to engage in conversations about periods or fashion but if you only appreciate her as a friend based on the terms that she denies her femininity, you either shouldn\u2019t be her friend OR start to get used to women and respect and accept them.", "ywbta, pretty sure you're going to get that overwhelmingly in the answers anyway. \n\nHer social interactions are hers to handle. My answer would be the same if you were asking a male friend who loved cars to stop talking about cars with your other friends.", "Yes, yes YWBTA.  \n\nYou would be asking her to fit in more with the guys when, in fact, she is not.  To ask her to change to fit in with the men, you're not going to make her feel bad.  YOU will find yourself without a friend.  \n\nWonder why your engineering program has so few women?  Many career fields suffer from misogyny, esp engineering.   Good on your friend for being who she is and enjoying make-up, high heels and nails, none of which makes her less serious or committed to this program.   \n\nIf men cannot be friends with women unless they act more like a man, that is on them.  But don't enable that behavior.  At some point, you will be a mentor for young women; this is not a good start.", "I love how you made friends with \u2018men\u2019, but she is a \u2018girl\u2019. Quit being part of the problem and be part of the solution.", "YTA.", "Why care what other people think? Please don\u2019t shame your friend for expressing herself", "YTA. Normal bodily functions are not embarrassing. If you don\u2019t like someone else\u2019s clothes, that\u2019s a you problem, not a them problem. Fashion is not a \u201cgirly\u201d topic. Why are you and your friends \u201cmen\u201d but she\u2019s a \u201cgirl\u201d when you\u2019re all the same age?\n\nYou\u2019re ill educated with a narrow worldview and sexist tendencies. Good news though, it\u2019s never too late to start learning and become a better human.", "YWBTA, \n\nLook, I\u2019m sure you are going to get dogpiled, but I have a feeling this stems a lot more from social anxiety, rather than any malicious intent.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with enjoying or bringing up feminine topics, as a matter of fact, I would say it\u2019s a good thing as it will expand you and possibly your friends worldview and get all of you out of your own comfort zones, which can only be a positive thing.\n\nYou are shy and don\u2019t like to draw what you deem as unwarranted attention to yourself, I think you are projecting that onto your friend by wanting her to play down how she expresses herself, and are also projecting that into the topics she occasionally brings up as you think it may bring negative attention from the friend group (but you don\u2019t actually KNOW that). \n\nIf occasionally bringing up, feminine topics truly does make the friend group think less of her, I would encourage you to reflect on if that\u2019s a group of people you want to align yourself with.

She is more my friend than the others, the other people are more like people I go to events with than friends.", "exactly right!!! she'll hear enough of this from other people, she doesn't need her \"friends\" to do the same", ">Do men not care about fashion at all?\n\nEngineering students? No, not at all.", "This is the comment I was looking for. OP\u2019s fear that the other guys will think less of him for hanging out with a woman who sounds smart and amazing is entirely in his head. Perhaps OP should test this theory and ask his male friends, \u201chey do you think less of me for being friends with this incredible woman?\u201d The answer might surprise him.", "Thank you for sharing your experience. I will definitely let her express herself and be who she is freely.", "You are right, in real life I do tend to use dude and girl for younger people and men and women for older people.", "Thank you, yeah I know reddit can be harsh. I do get it though.\n\nI know some people in the friend group are like that but not all and they do judge her a little but that is their fault not hers.", "You are right, I do not know why I worded it like that. But in real life I tend to say dude/girl for younger people and man/woman for older people.", "Some of the others do give such cues or talk about her and other girls when they are not around, that is why I was worried. But I understand now that, that would be their issue and a problem with them not her.", "If they \"think less of her\" then they are immature as all heck. All of you are very young, and as a young man, I think you need to really think about why it's appropriate for anyone to think less of someone for being feminine. And if they do think less of her, then you should tell them why they're wrong for that. If they give you a hard time for it, they're not good people to be associating with.", "OP, I want you to look really carefully at your wording in this post and your comments. You refer to yourself and the other program participants as \u201cmen\u201d and your friend as a \u201cgirl.\u201d Even though you consider her a friend, you\u2019re still thinking of and treating her as lesser.", "I can see that you have a good heart and mean no harm, and you seem to realize that YWBTA from listening to everyone here. I would gently suggest that you do some serious thinking about the assumptions that led you to this post. The idea that feminine topics are lesser or worthy of scorn, the idea that your friend is not capable of reading the room or making an informed decision on what to wear or talk about.\n\nI\u2019m going to make the assumption that you consider yourself something of a nerd, and probably feel awkward sometimes in social situations. There is nothing wrong with either of these things, but I think there is a common tendency among guys like you, who have not had many female friends, to consider women like they\u2019re another species. Your female friend is just as intelligent as you, with just as rich of an inner life. Her feelings are just like yours. She is not oblivious that men in engineering don\u2019t always share her interests. She just doesn\u2019t care, because why should she?\n\nIf you had a male friend who was into woodworking, would you consider that something he needed to hide from the fellow engineers? Probably not \u2014 just because others don\u2019t share that interest doesn\u2019t make it shameful. I would strongly urge you to consider your friend\u2019s \u201cfeminine\u201d interests and presentation the same way. Makeup and fashion, after all, are forms of artistic self-expression \u2014 what\u2019s so wrong with that?\n\nThe solution to misogyny is not for your friend to dull her sparkle. The solution is for you to have her back if anyone gives her a hard time. That requires you to be brave. Give that some consideration.", "Less of her for being into feminine things?  Do you think less of male friends being into masculine things?", "This is all your anxiety speaking.", "Do you want to be friends with the type of people who would think less of her because she has feminine interests and dresses feminine?", "Why would they think less of her ?", "You say you\u2019re worried they\u2019d think less of her. Would you stand up for your friend if they do?", "In that case, it's good you came to ask about it. I'm sorry that you're absolutely going to get a firestorm of people yelling at you, but listen to what the ones who are trying to help you are saying and try to understand.", "If you think that they\u2019ll think less of her for being feminine, you\u2019re basically saying that your friend group thinks less of women.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be friends with such sexist AHs.", "Good you picked up on this. It sounds like you realize you\u2019re only embarrassed in front of other people. Why? Cause she talks about girly things? Who cares? If they talked about \u201cboy things\u201d would you be embarrassed for her to have to listen? If they have a problem with it, they should figure out why they have difficulty socializing with a female. You\u2019re not responsible for other peoples emotions. Don\u2019t let embarrassment ruin a friendship - be confident in your choices.", "I think it\u2019s important that you not only check yourself when it comes to situations like this but also your friends. If your friends ever say anything to you about her, I advise you to correct them in their biases. Engineering is a very misogynistic program and sometimes it takes other men speaking up to change the opinions of others.", "I totally get that. But keep this in mind. Anytime you think to yourself, \"I'm really worried other people will judge her (or me, or anyone else)\" it's really just *you* judging on behalf of everyone else. I know you don't feel like you're judging her, but you are. You're judging that *everyone else* won't accept her, but that's really just coming from *you*. All the more reason why if you brought this up to her, she wouldn't feel judged by anyone else, just you. No one else is saying anything. \n\nBut you can talk to her about it. \"Hey, I know you're surrounded by a bunch of dudes. Do you ever feel excluded? Do you ever feel like no one else shares your interests?\" The important thing here is not to get her to see ways to change herself, but rather to find ways you can help her feel more included and accepted.", "That is a good call. Unless she is incredibly sympathetic it would have severely damaged your friendship, or worse her confidence if she is also a shy person.", "Good call my man. And I hope it's a breath of fresh air to have a different personality and someone with some feminine insight around. You said you're shy around women? She's obviously helped you to be comfortable around her, so this is just the start of some beautiful growth!\n\nI think it's absolutely awesome when my male friends ask me feminine anatomy/gender-related questions before they just assume or make some ignorant statement.", "You're concerned the other guys will judge you. You don't even know if they will, but you are worried they will what? Think you're less of a man for having a friend that looks, acts, and talks like a girl? Why exactly would that reflect negatively on you? Because she *checks notes* talks about fashion in a way that relates to the topic and mentioned periods..... right.... \n\n\nIf you're that insecure in what makes you a \"man\" you've got some toxic masculinity to unlearn. You're so worried about others perceiving you as man enough that being too close with anything \"feminine\" is a threat. You've got some issues to unpack my friend.", "Stop thinking for other people. And if they care, they are just as immature as you.", "You can leave \"will my cool acquaintences think I have cooties\" back in childhood, friend. You literally do not need to worry about this.", "Hey. I think you are taking the right steps.... Though the comments are mostly correct in message some seem quite unnecessarily cruel.. considering that you're young and thoughtful enough to ask before you do. Your friend sounds as cool as  you!", "So her clothes and interest are okay in isolation, but she should put on an act for everyone else?  Because deep down, her femininity is uncomfortable to you and you're projecting that on other guys.  This is your judgment... they haven't complained.", "Maybe they'd benefit from conversation about it", "Yes please. You\u2018ll probably get used to it quickly and find you have found a friend for life. All the best to you and your friend group! Have fun and make some memories!", "You are all young, and you are at a point in your life where you all will experience the most exposure to people different than yourselves and different worldviews, which in turn can mean the most growth as people.\n\nHopefully with time those friends perspectives will change. If not, it\u2019s as you said: not her or your problem.", "Indeed. I will think more about this and get what you are saying.\n\nI know she faces challenges regarding that and has talked to me about it sometimes. And I have witnessed guys say and make remarks about the girls in the program that are problematic.", "I agree. These concerns OP has are literally 100% in his head.", "No, I usually do not stay friends with people like that, and usually they have other issues as well like racism.\n\nI have acquaintances that are like that though.", "It has never happened in front of her.\n\nBut I do so indirectly, like when some guys say they do not do group projects with girls because they suck and like to get carried, I tell them I did some projects with my friend and other girls and they were really good and we got a good grade.", "Yes that makes sense, sounds like my issue not hers and something I need to address.", "Yeah, I know about that and I have seen some misogynistic things happen and my friend has told me about some things that happened to her as well.", "I was also worried they might think less of her. But you are right, this is a wrong way of thinking. I will address my issues.", "Not in front of her, but some of them have said things about her and other girls when they are not around, like not wanting to get paired with them on group projects and stuff.", "Well, I don't disagree, but going with the odds, we're talking about a group of timid, awkward ASD boys. Having a girl in the group can only be good for them, but the odds of them being able to relate to her on certain topics are fairly slim.\n\nNot arguing *for* the OP,  but fashion is likely something they would not get.", "I encourage you to think more about this! It\u2019s really easy to internalize some problematic assumptions about gender when you\u2019re young. The important thing is that you can think critically and unlearn when necessary.\n\nBeing an ally for your friend, and other women in your life, is not easy. Sometimes it means going against friends and acquaintances. I think you have a good heart, and I believe that you are capable of being the guy who stands up to others when they\u2019re doing wrong.", "Exactly. \n\nYou need to change, not her.", "And what did you *do* about them?", "Which of the things you mentioned above would make anyone less and why?", "Then the problem is the misogyny of those guys and not your friend.  Let me tell you how hard it is to be a woman here... if you're pretty, you can't possibly be smart.  If you're not pretty, how unfuckable you are will be discussed all the time.  There is NO WAY for women to win here... if they are conventionally attractive they're sluts and bimbos, if they're not conventionally feminine and attractive they don't even deserve to be in the room.  If your friend wears only sweats and never discusses \"girl things\" again, these guys will still talk shit about her because it's not her, it's THEM.  If you want to be her friend, call them out on the casual misogyny and include her in your group projects because that is how you be an ally.", "Yeah, I noticed some things like guys who do not want to do group projects with girls and assuming they are worse etc and talking about them when they are not around.", "Sometimes, I do correct them. Like when some guys were discussing that they did not want to work with girls for group projects, I saw I worked with her and others and it went great.\n\nOr sometimes when they find out I have a girl on a project team and say things like she probably wants to get carried I tell them that no she contributes a lot and is really good because it is true.", "I get it, I was just concerned they might think of her as not cool, less smart because of her other interests etc, but that would be a fault of theirs not hers.", "I understand, that sounds horrible. And yes when they said that, I mentioned working with her and some other girls in group projects and how it went well and we got full marks and everyone contributed."]}
