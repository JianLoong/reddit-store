You can offer, or you can ask, but you don\u2019t assume any food bought by anyone other than yourself is fair game. This *is* going to require a shit-ton more fridge space, especially with what sounds like a ridiculous amount of people living there. We usually each have a section of the fridge and a section of the pantry reserved for different people. \n\nJust get a fridge and a lock, and pay the difference in the extra utilities if it kicks up the energy bill. End of story.\n\nIf many of them are new to living away from home, there\u2019s usually a pretty big initial disconnect in expectations. People often vastly underestimate how much it actually costs to supply toilet paper, garbage bags, soap, groceries, etc, because it\u2019s always simply been supplied for them. They\u2019re used to going to the fridge or cupboard and having whatever looks good to them. I\u2019ve even had roommates whine at me because *my* food that was the fridge wasn\u2019t what they wanted to eat. It\u2019s just a mindset shift and a reality check that they need to have. You eat what you buy, and if you didn\u2019t put it in the shelf, it\u2019s not up for grabs. And it is no one\u2019s responsibility but their own to feed them or look after them.\n\nThey called you a selfish hoarder, you could call them immature mooches, but it won\u2019t help. They legitimately haven\u2019t clicked yet that mooching is what they\u2019re doing. Food for them has probably always been a self-renewing resource, rather than an expense. Since this is the first time and it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019ve ever actually sat down to establish boundaries.. it\u2019s time to do so.\n\nLike I said, sharing food is an opt-in, opt-out situation, not a roommate expectation.
