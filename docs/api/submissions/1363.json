He goes no dumbass move into the other chair. And inmm like why and he goes because I'm getting on the computer to download steam games. I tell him he can use the other chair because I'm already sitting in this one and it's a chair. He gets pissy and goes outside after slamming the door and my mom comes in like what did you do this time? And I tell her and she says you gotta get along with people at work and I'm like, this isn't work this is family and the fact you compare the 2 is concerning.
