I really enjoy my job; even though I\u2019m only being paid minimum wage, the store is quiet most of the time, my manager is super chill, and my coworkers are all fantastic. I\u2019ve never had a problem with anyone up until now. \n\nOne of my coworkers, Brian (~30sM), and I worked in the same area of the nursery and talked/bantered regularly since he was hired last summer. We have some of the same interests and got along really well. Brian is disabled; I don\u2019t know which disability or disabilities he has, but they seem to be cognitive-based. He has an attendant who can only work 8AM-1PM on weekdays, and once I started school and switched to only working Sundays we didn\u2019t see each other until I graduated.\n\nOn my first day back full-time, he was very excited to see me and hugged me when I came in. I don\u2019t like being touched at all for personal reasons, so I was a little out of it and didn\u2019t say anything. This was the first time he\u2019s tried to hug me too, so I wasn\u2019t expecting it. We talked a bit afterwards and parted ways.\n\nA little later into the day, we ran into each other and Brian hugged me once more. This time I pulled out of it and asked if we could high-five instead since I know he does that with other coworkers. He looked dejected but said alright and we high-fived to seal the deal. An hour after that, he hugged me once more and when I said \u201coh, no thanks,\u201d he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d and held onto me before kissing me several times on the cheek. I got out of the hug and had a bit of a panic attack in the washroom before going home early. I really don\u2019t like being touched.\n\nThe next day, same thing. I tried several times to communicate and practice our high-five technique, but he showed no interest and kept hugging. I spoke with his attendant (she hadn\u2019t been present when this happened) and asked if she could speak with him, but she brushed me off and said he hugs her all the time. I explained why I didn\u2019t like it, but she didn\u2019t seem to care. The whole situation ended up being extremely taxing on my mental health, and I dreaded going to work the next day.\n\nWhen it eventually happened again the following morning, I went straight to my manager and explained the situation. He said he understood completely and that Brian\u2019s behaviour was unacceptable, etc. My manager ended up talking to him and the attendant and gave them some kind of warning. Afterward, the attendant took me aside and said I shouldn\u2019t have reported Brian because he didn\u2019t mean anything by hugging/kissing me and that\u2019s just how he communicates affection. I said he still invaded the boundaries I set and that I was uncomfortable regardless. She called me cruel and discriminatory before walking away.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680644701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bxqm1/aita_for_reporting_my_disabled_coworker/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Go back to your manager and report what the attendant said to you.\n\nThe attendant's job is to help Brian get by in the adult world, and that includes abiding by basic workplace rules like \"don't touch your coworkers, especially if they've asked you not to.\" If he's not capable of following this rule, he doesn't get a pass for his disability, he gets fired--and quite frankly, that means the attendant needs to be fired, too.", "NTA\n\nYou handled that amazingly well, sounded very polite, and gave him multiple chances to learn. But this....\n\n>the attendant took me aside and said I shouldn\u2019t have reported Brian because he didn\u2019t mean anything by hugging/kissing me and that\u2019s just how he communicates affection.\n\n...is the problem, that attendant is fostering abusive behavior. How he prefers to show affection does not invalidate your preferences. Your right to personal space is more important than his preferred method of showing affection. He needs to understand how he shows affection can hurt people.\n\nYou're in no way obligated to do so, but honestly the attendant's manager needs a warning about this.", "NTA. His coach is failing him.", "NTA, he was completely ignoring the boundaries you set and making you uncomfortable. Brian acknowledged that you didn\u2019t want to be hugged when he said \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d and hugged you anyways, meaning he knew you didn\u2019t want it but chose to disregard that.", "NTA.  You have a right to have boundaries.  His attendant should have stepped in when you first asked, she is very lazy and bad at her job.  No way she should have reprimanded you, the should be helping Brian to learn how to function in the world successfully, which means he can't hug people who don't want to be hugged.  Having a mental disability isn't a free pass to do anything to anyone without their permission.", "NTA, your boundaries matter. You communicated clearly, multiple times.", "Nope nope nope.\n\nWhatever his intention or cognitive abilities are, they don't supercede your very reasonable need for not being touched or having your personal space invaded. \n\nI think you were very gracious in trying to talk with him, offering high-fives, and talking with his attendant (who btw is doing him a huge disservice). She's not doing her job and I wonder if his family would be happy knowing that she's not helping him learn how to interact with other people. You had no other recourse\n\nNTA\n\nYou were the opposite of cruel and discriminatory.  Don't let that lazy asshole attendant in your head.", "NTA. You were more than reasonable and gave him AND the attendant many chances to correct the behavior. I don\u2019t care if you love physical touch; you have a right to choose who does the touching.", "NTA. \u201cNo\u201d and \u201cStop\u201d are complete sentences. ADA accommodations do not give anyone a free pass to assault another person. I write this from the perspective of having a special needs child of my own and having volunteered for decades helping parents with disabled children. \nContact the assistant\u2019s employer and file a complaint. Ask your supervisor to reassign one of you to another area where you do not see each other. Post an update please.", "You are NTA but the attendant is!!! Someone\u2019s disability does not trump peoples boundaries or right to personal space. They are doing him a disservice and probably have been for a long time. If they work for an agency I would recommend filing a complaint there", "NTA he knows that you didn\u2019t like it but did it anyway. It\u2019s totally okay to set boundaries", "NTA\n\nYou set clear boundaries and you even explained your reasons, which are valid, I can fully understand, how it would make you uncomfortable. Just because someone expresses their affection in a certain way does not mean that you have to accept it. You even tried to communicate it multiple times. I don't see, why would you have to respect their feelings, when they don't respect yours.", "NTA\n\nThis situation is sexual harassment and it 100% NEEDS to be taken seriously. Especially if he is cognitively disabled. That does not give him the right to continue to touch you after you said stop and this behaviour needs to be addressed.", "NTA. He's disabled, but that doesn't mean he shouldn't be capable of respecting boundaries, or at least actively working on it. You were kind, and gave reasonable alternatives you could live with. Honestly, his aide or attendant should have jumped in in the moment and helped him work through the situation. I think if anyone, she is TA here, especially for lashing out at you. I wonder if she isn't worried about getting in trouble for not jumping in when it happened, because like, that seems like something that would fall to her, helping him understand the situation and respect the boundary.", "NTA at all.\n\nI'd imagine the attendant got chewed out at the same time and she didn't like it.", "NTA.  You approached his assistant first and she did not do her job.\n\nShe is probably being mean because this reflects poorly on her.", "NTA. His attendant is an idiot. She\u2019s there to guide Brian in appropriate work behavior. Hugging and repeated kissing is inappropriate.", "NTA\n\nYou asked him multiples times to stop and he persisted to the point of outright refusing your requests. Escalating the problem to management was the right move. \n\nOtherwise, the attendant putting up with that behavior is her own business, just as you not putting up with it is yours.", "NTA \n\nYou did everything else you possibly could for days before having to go to management.", "NTA - Good on your boss for being supportive. If it happens again, tell the boss the attendant is also being manipulative after you spoke up.  No is no and should be respected .", "Oh heck no. NTA. You told him that you did not like to be touched. When that did not work you went to his attendant and told his attendant. When his attendant did not help correct the problem, the correct response is to go directly to your supervisor because it is an unsafe work environment for you. He needs to learn that no means no.", "NTA.  If he can't heed warnings about unwanted touching, he shouldn't be working.", "You absolutely don't have to put up with innappropriate behaviour which makes you uncomfortable regardless of the cognitive abilities of the person making you feel that way. NTA", "Being differently enabled doesn't excuse him crossing boundaries. Even if he couldn't understand them properly, his aide could. \n\nNta.", "NTA, she's upset because she likely got in trouble too. She's bad at her job and I'd report that interaction too", "NTA - you gave him multiple opportunities.  His disabilities do not give him the right to force himself on you.", "You\u2019re definitely not the AH at all. If you don\u2019t want to be touched, that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t need to justify it at all. You gave a lot of good faith attempts and tried to resolve it first through Brian (multiple times) and his aid. That didn\u2019t work so you resolved it peacefully through the manager. You handled it extremely well and went above and beyond with empathy and consideration.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Disability isn\u2019t a reason to allow someone to violate your bubble.", "NTA Brian and his attendant are. You need to report to your manager what the attendant did because that's retaliation. Your manager needs to deal with the Brian and the attendant.", "NTA. I don't care if they are disabled or not, it is NEVER ok to touch/grab/kiss someone who has repeatedly Said no. The fact that his attendant is trying to make you the bad guy is absurd", "NTA. If she had done her job and reinforced your boundaries, you wouldn't have had to report him.", "NTA. Report to your boss that conversation with the attendant.  If nothing else to have a record that she started a conflict with you in case she ever tries to get you in trouble. She might try to find a way to get rid of you if, in her eyes, it protects Brian.", "The attendant is massively failing her client. Brian may be much younger cognitively than his 30 years but he still would have the strength of an adult male. An adult male who doesn\u2019t care when their violate someone else\u2019s boundaries is a terrifying prospect. If he pulls this on the wrong person, he could get seriously hurt. All because some jerk can\u2019t be bothered to tell Brian don\u2019t do that. Tell your boss what the attendant said and ask your boss to call their boss. This is seriously not okay that Brian\u2019s attendant is condoning sexual harassment. NTA", "NTA his disabilities doesn't mean he's able to overstep your boundaries without consequences; you verbalized your boundaries very clearly & tried to navigate him towards something you were more comfortable doing. Him ignoring your boundaries & doing as he pleases with your body makes him an AH. If anything you didn't discriminate against him since you held him to the same standards as his peers & even gave him alternatives that he refused & ignored.", "NTA he is cognitive enough to know no means no. He even acknowledged he knew better when he stated he didn't care.", "So, NAH. Except maybe the attendant. Actually\u2026 ya, the attendant. The guy hugging you probably missed you tremendously and was beyond excited to see you again\u2026 and it\u2019s entirely possible that he has loved ones in his life that respond to asking not to be hugged in a similar way\u2026 it\u2019s entirely possible he can\u2019t tell the difference between family playfulness and serious need to not be touched. So I don\u2019t think he is doing anything intentionally wrong, but I do think going to your manager was the right tbh NG to do after you went to the guy\u2019s attendant and they chose to be no help. You had to get help from someone. You did nothing wrong.", "I agree with this as well.", "Agreed. NTA. The attendant is not doing her job properly, and though her responsibility is to Brian, she is failing you both.  \n\nIt's not your fault, and not your responsibility to teach him for her. Reporting them was the best thing to do. As much as you can, minimize interactions with him and completely stop them where he violates your space again.

Arguing might make it seem like you can be persuaded. \n\nThey might not be happy about it, but they're the ones being T A.", "Yep. Exactly! NTA - In the words of comedian Tom Segura: people with disabilities have to earn their cool points like everybody else.\n\nCool people respect the boundaries of others.", "Exactly. His attendant needs to be reported to her bosses too she\u2019s being horribly unprofessional and encouraging his literally criminal behaviour. Good luck op.", "Having a disability is not an excuse to ignore someone else's boundaries. She tried taking to him, explained and offered an alternative. THEN she talked to the attendant who's entire job would be to make sure he is adding appropriately/help with interactions. Only after that did nothing did she talk to the manager. NO ONE has the right to trample over another's boundaries.\n\n And, on a personal opinion note, I HATE when people tell someone to \"make an effort\" when they have very implicitly started why they are uncomfortable in a situation. Especially when the uncomfortable person is the recipient of sexual harassment and this situation IS sexual harassment. She said stop and neither he, nor the attendant, did anything to stop it.", "People with cognitive disabilities can learn boundaries. She asked several times directly and he didn't listen, only then escalating to his attendant and then her manager. That was the proper order of events. He absolutely needed to learn, and to apply the idea that she did NOT want to be touched.", "OP could be TA if reported him as harasser but she did not, she just asked for help with harmful for her mentality situation. Aid is definitely unprofessional and ignorant TA.", "it is not on OP to just tolerate being forcibly kissed against her will because her attacker happens to be disabled. really think about the thing you're saying here.", "Nope.

What happens when he doesn't listen to a no and the person defends themselves physically? Hits him? Pepper sprays him? Our someone else over hearts and pulls him off violently? Not everyone is patient. Lots of people have their own trauma and issues and will not respond to unwanted touch in such a forgiving way as OP had.
