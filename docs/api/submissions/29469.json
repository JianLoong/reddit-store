I am a minimalist and that clutter would make my brain itch.  Tell her you hide in your home office because you can't function around this mess.  Help her clean it up, don't take no for an answer.  If this seems to cause her distress, then I highly recommend therapy.", "NTA. If it has come to the point you are avoiding your wife and daughter because of all the clutter and \"stuff\", something has to change. She's not getting how serious this is becoming for you, you aren't getting why she feels the need to hold onto - and keep acquiring - stuff. This will only get worse if you don't face it head on.

I'll clean when it's clearly out of control but it only pisses her off.", "As someone who identifies a lot with your wife here, NTA. There\u2019s such a thing as holding onto something \u201cjust in case\u201d which can end up with you just keeping everything you every encounter. I learned this the hard way during a recent move: sometimes you need to be harsh with yourself and let stuff go. 9/10 times you don\u2019t miss it once it\u2019s gone, and the rare times that you do it\u2019s usually pretty easy to buy again. \n\nYou need to have a long discussion with your wife about how you need your home to be, there is certainly a compromise to be made here.", "NTA, it is also your home and should be a welcoming space for you.

The very definition of hoarding is having an emotional attachment to items that others consider to useless or unsanitary or trash.  Your wife needs therapy.  The sooner the better, before she spends all of your money and completely ruins your house or your marriage, like the people on the tv shows.", "I know how you feel, sometimes when it feels like too much to handle, the best thing to do it get a big plastic storage box, gently place all the goodies that currently reside in the bowls in the big box and put the box in the garage to be gone through when they have more time.  Same with clothes, take a little time, anything not worn in the last year goes into a box, box goes in the garage, then you reexamine at a later date to decide.  This takes away the stress of having to throw away things that can't be donated (it took me years to accept I have to throw away a perfectly good pen because nobody need 50 pens and you can't donate cheap pens) and it also allows people to let go of the sentimental attachment to things if they've been out of sight long enough.", "Your wife may have a hoarding problem.  The hardest thing about hoarding is that an outsider doing a \"force clean\" will make the hoarding behavior worse.\n\nIs your wife in therapy at all?", "A minimalist and a maximalist.. a love story. \n\nHas your wife always been this way? Is it getting harder to clean things up because life is just busier? Does she need to see everything? \n\nI'm not going to pass judgment or try to diagnose your wife's issue because clutter is an absolutely stressful thing for many (including myself), but I will pass along the resource that made everything click for me and then my husband. \n\nIt's from Dana K White, A Slob Comes Clean. Specifically,  look at The Container Theory. It helps cut through the issues of one is good,  more is better and having everything out in the oven. Total game changer for me.", "NTA. You described my mom. Shit every where, shopping problem, goes through all the trash you try to throw out and takes crap out of it. I absolutely hate it.\n\nRecently she was out of town for 10 days while a family member had surgery.. my step dad and I ransacked the house and got rid of so much crap.

Bag shit up in secret and stash the bag, but don't toss it!", "When my kids were young, a couple times a year, I'd go through all their belongings and remove what they'd outgrown (clothes, toys, books). I'd keep a couple of keepsake things with other legacy items and box everything else up. I'd hold onto those boxes for 2 weeks. I'd tell the kids that if there was anything specific they missed, they could have it back. Never had them ask for a thing. \n\nSide note, they also learned not to care so much about stuff. I mean, if you can't name it and don't miss it just because it's in a box...how important was it?\n\nThe boxes would get donated.", "My suggestion is plastic shoe boxes. They have lids and can stack.", "ESH\n\nIt was N T A until I got the part where you mention throwing things out without telling them, and then that you\u2019re thinking of continuing to secretly throw stuff out. I get that they don\u2019t notice but you shouldn\u2019t be throwing out things that belong to them without their consent, there seems to be more going on then just procrastination or an unwillingness to clean, it doesn\u2019t have to be depression to be related to mental health.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
