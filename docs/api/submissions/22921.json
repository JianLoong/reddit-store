There are plenty of images people can and do choose to get that, while still falling under the category of \"your body, your choice,\" makes them an asshole. Racist, sexist or any form of bigoted imagery makes the person choosing them an asshole. \"Your body, your choice\" simply means no one has the right to stop you. It does not mean that what you're doing isn't hurtful.\n\nIn your case, you chose to put a trigger for your husband's phobia in a place he will likely see when he is engaging in a very intimate, vulnerable activity with you.  I would not be surprised if this has a serious impact on your intimacy, sexual and otherwise, with your husband.  Great sex between two loving people often involves each person allowing themselves to be open and vulnerable.  How will your husband do this now that the person he is supposed to be open and vulnerable with has chosen to throw a trigger for his phobia right in his face?\n\nSo I'd say YTA, both to your husband (for being so thoughtless about his phobia and potentially damaging an important intimate relationship for him) and to yourself (for also potentially damaging an intimate relationship for you).  Phobias should never be taken lightly. They are a form of mental illness.", "Gonna agree with the majority and say YTA. I'm not sure why I see so many partners on here obsessed with \"me me me, and mine mine mine.\" A partnership is, well, a partnership. And part of that includes taking your partners needs and feelings into consideration when making decisions. Yes, it's your body, yes, it's your choice. But he did not forbid you, he asked you kindly to take his feelings into consideration, which you did not do, and that's what makes you ta. Relationships are give and take and sometimes we have to give up things we might want or do things we might not want to do, simply out of consideration for our other half. If my husband expressed that he did not want me to do something due to a phobia, I would take that seriously, because I love him, and I also have to live with him lol. There's no reason for me to cause trouble over something that I could just easily avoid by being compassionate to his feelings. If you have a serious serious need for a snake tattoo, you could have gotten something small, or something less visible, but you chose a hand sized tattoo right on your thigh, where he will have to see it every time you undress. That's not taking his feelings into consideration. I would be super annoyed to be faced with my phobia every time my husband undressed. It's just a matter of asking myself, \"would I want him to do this to me?\" If the answer is no, then that's your answer too.", "I feel like maybe you should\u2019ve discussed it with your husband. It is your body but it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t take what the man your married to for life, says into consideration. \n\nHowever, I also feel having a fear of snakes is serious. But a drawing really shouldn\u2019t constitute any fear he may feel. If you draw a squiggly line, is he going to freak out? \n\nBut YTA. You should take your husbands feelings into account especially if it\u2019s a fear, however silly it may be.", "YTA, assuming he really does have a phobia of snakes.  He is your HUSBAND.  Why would you get a tattoo of something you know he hates?  That's just shitty behavior.  I think your husband respects your right to self-expression through tattoos, but you obviously don't respect him.\n\nLike I have a phobia of strawberry yoohoo, if my partner got a tattoo of that I'd fucking leave him.

Strawberry yoohoo.)", "I mean, I\u2019m wavering between NAH and YTA. \n\nHe has a phobia. He can\u2019t help how he feels about snakes.

Also it being in a kind of intimate spot kinda sends the message of \u201cidc what your opinion is and now you can see it and be reminded that idc every time we get down\u201d, or that\u2019s how I would feel if my husband did it to me. A good compromise would have been to get a piece with different elements where you could have just made the Medusa a part of an overall bigger design, for example like a sun with different smaller things inside of it like birds, fish, and a Medusa, so that it blends to him but you still get the Medusa and a totally unique tattoo.", "YTA Your husband should get a divorce asap.

Despite being able to logically reason that it means nothing I would probably not be able to date/marry someone that had an owl tattoo and would have issues if they had owl motifs in their/our home. This is something that I honestly would bring up early-ish in a relationship. Again it is totally illogical from a modern perspective but owls are a no-go for me. Bad medicine and I don\u2019t need any representation of them around me.

As an artist I'd also like to add that by disregarding the husband's phobia, OP missed an opportunity to get creative with the tattoo because a lot of great art comes from working around restrictions. It could have been really interesting to brainstorm ways to depict Medusa as a character trying to hide her snakes for the husband's comfort. It would add a whole new layer of symbolism to it, too! Medusa as a dangerous woman who chooses to hide parts of herself - it could be seen as a feminist statement against how impossible it is to be authentically accepted as a woman in society, or maybe she's tactically being underestimated. Or the decision could be interpreted as an act of love, covering her snakes and eyes to protect someone she doesn't want to petrify. \n\nMy point is, it didn't have to be a binary decision.

The terror of Medusa is thus a terror of castration that is linked to the sight of something. Numerous analyses have made us familiar with the occasion for this: it occurs when a boy, who has hitherto been unwilling to believe the threat of castration, catches sight of the female genitals, probably those of an adult, surrounded by hair, and essentially those of his mother.  \n\n> The hair upon Medusa's head is frequently represented in works of art in the form of snakes, and these once again are derived from the castration complex. It is a remarkable fact that, however frightening they may be in themselves, they nevertheless serve actually as a mitigation of the horror, for they replace the penis, the absence of which is the cause of the horror. This is a confirmation of the technical rule according to which a multiplication of penis symbols signifies castration.  \n\n> The sight of Medusa's head makes the spectator stiff with terror, turns him to stone. Observe that we have here once again the same origin from the castration complex and the same transformation of affect! For becoming stiff means an erection.

I can look at someone's face if we're talking, but I can't focus on their eyes. And I can't stand any kind of drawn eye. You can be the love of my life, but if you get an eye tattoo, I'm ending our relationship. Stop thinking that the way YOU live your phobia is equal to the way OTHER PEOPLE do.", "Your body your choice, but why is making your partner unhappy a choice you want to make?", "Why stay with someone so goddamn perfect?", "You know, that's exactly how a phobia works. When you have a real phobia, you're not afraid only by the real thing, but by every thing that refers to the phobia.", "Given that he's \"not too bothered\" by snakes at the zoo, I'd say that, perhaps, it's not an actual PHOBIA but a fear/disgust. That and his dislike of tattoos generally, he might just be mad because you did something he asked you not to, that reminds him of something that gives him discomfort. All in all, I'd say NTA", "Usually Medusa tattoos are a symbol for SA survivors. There could be a deeper reason for why OP wanted it and they just weren\u2019t comfortable to disclose on a forum?", "It depends on the story. Medusa's assault was written by Ovid, who often wrote about the Greco-Roman gods as awful beings who misuse their power. \n\nEarlier tellings have her and her sisters, the Gorgons, as monsters and Medusa's image was used as a ward against evil, appearing on everything from pottery to Alexander the Great's armor. \n\nEven then, her depictions differ from storyteller to storyteller. In some stories of Perseus, she is depicted as a woman, in others she's a monster Perseus has to outsmart", "As an SA survivor, it is why I hate the myth so much. There are better examples in Greek mythology. I understand the concept of taking power back but the Medusa myth is not one I can find any power in.", "I feel like there\u2019s also some level of premeditated attempted unaliving in that. Like, words or ghosting would at least not get you 5-10.", "Hey kids, our first lesson today is method acting...", "So you're saying that everyone experiences everything the same? /s\n\nIt's not just when they go on a hike too, every time he even looks at his wife he'll see a snake for the rest of their life.", "Smashing!", "\ud83d\ude02 Military... Close enough", "And it can ebb and flow throughout the years with how much it affects you.", "You're right, it's a tattoo that features a bunch of snakes", "I mean you have an excellent point but I\u2019ve never heard of Medusa being a SA tattoo. \n\nBut I\u2019m glad I know now because I was going to incorporate her into my sleeve but fuck it.", "It's a pretty asshole move to get married and think only of self. People like you will jump to defend someone getting offended over pronouns but a man being uncomfortable is misogyny? Idk how you came up with your username but you really embracing it.", "I\u2019m saying his treatable condition shouldn\u2019t stop her from enriching her life however she chooses. HE\u2019S the one only thinking about HIMSELF. \n\nI\u2019m saying it\u2019s misogynistic to imply a husband has the right to make the decision for his wife\u2019s body. \n\nAnd supporting that makes you a misogynist. \n\nYou must lack reasoning skills.\n\nETA: you needing to comment on my username rather than following a logical argument just illustrates to me that you know you\u2019re wrong but have such a fragile ego you\u2019re resorting to trying to embarrass me? \n\nYou\u2019re literally pathetic lol", "Geez and I was scared of my arachnophobia but it sure doesn\u2019t look like this!  They make my skin crawl far more than other animals and I can\u2019t get over that, but otherwise I\u2019m really not afraid of them more than I am snakes, or other scary nature shit.   I must not actually be phobic.  \n\nI was able to cure my arachnophobia for several years through rock climbing, since the heights were scarier than the spiders.   So that was cool, but it did wear off and now I\u2019m scared of spiders while climbing \ud83d\ude22", "Or more accurately an idiot", "I think it is odd women love the Medusa story. It makes me so incredibly sad. Gets raped,  turned into a monster by a jealous god in a horrific act of victim blaming, and then killed. Like.. not sure I want that myth tattooed anywhere on me.", "The fact thats medusa isn't lost on me either. Its a woman that kills men who look at her... I mean...", "Snakes... medusa isn't the issue. I did look at other women villains but medusa is the lady for me lol.\n\nExactly what she said earlier, so no I don't buy that she initially chose it for that reason. Sounds like a convenient excuse after learning about it.", "Or a tattoo of another woman\u2019s name on his heart?", "I had never needed a trigger warning before your post", "It is also more than the phobia. For me, it would be the blatant disrespect and lack of empathy. Who wants to be with someone who engages in something, even though they know it will adversely affect my mental and emotional wellbeing?", "This exactly. Like who wants a partner who\u2019s going to do something that makes them uncomfortable every single day?", "Would you say that you are triggered by it?", "No. Because that isn't the proper use of the term by any stretch."]}
