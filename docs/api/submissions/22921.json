He only asked you for one thing, and you disregarded it with \"it's my body, right? \n\nIt seems like you don't know how to compromise. \n\nYou probably don't have any phobias if you don't understand your husband's position in this.", "If your sex life dies, know that it is your fault. YTA", "YTA. Your husband was really against it b/c he finds snakes abhorrent. It feels almost passive-aggressive to go ahead & get anyway. You must not value his opinion at all. Begs the question, why are you even married to him?", "Sure it's your body, your choice, but that doesn't mean you're not an asshole for your choice.  There are plenty of images people can and do choose to get that, while still falling under the category of \"your body, your choice,\" makes them an asshole. Racist, sexist or any form of bigoted imagery makes the person choosing them an asshole. \"Your body, your choice\" simply means no one has the right to stop you. It does not mean that what you're doing isn't hurtful.\n\nIn your case, you chose to put a trigger for your husband's phobia in a place he will likely see when he is engaging in a very intimate, vulnerable activity with you.  I would not be surprised if this has a serious impact on your intimacy, sexual and otherwise, with your husband.  Great sex between two loving people often involves each person allowing themselves to be open and vulnerable.  How will your husband do this now that the person he is supposed to be open and vulnerable with has chosen to throw a trigger for his phobia right in his face?\n\nSo I'd say YTA, both to your husband (for being so thoughtless about his phobia and potentially damaging an important intimate relationship for him) and to yourself (for also potentially damaging an intimate relationship for you).  Phobias should never be taken lightly. They are a form of mental illness.", "Gonna agree with the majority and say YTA. I'm not sure why I see so many partners on here obsessed with \"me me me, and mine mine mine.\" A partnership is, well, a partnership. And part of that includes taking your partners needs and feelings into consideration when making decisions. Yes, it's your body, yes, it's your choice. But he did not forbid you, he asked you kindly to take his feelings into consideration, which you did not do, and that's what makes you ta. Relationships are give and take and sometimes we have to give up things we might want or do things we might not want to do, simply out of consideration for our other half. If my husband expressed that he did not want me to do something due to a phobia, I would take that seriously, because I love him, and I also have to live with him lol. There's no reason for me to cause trouble over something that I could just easily avoid by being compassionate to his feelings. If you have a serious serious need for a snake tattoo, you could have gotten something small, or something less visible, but you chose a hand sized tattoo right on your thigh, where he will have to see it every time you undress. That's not taking his feelings into consideration. I would be super annoyed to be faced with my phobia every time my husband undressed. It's just a matter of asking myself, \"would I want him to do this to me?\" If the answer is no, then that's your answer too.", "I feel like maybe you should\u2019ve discussed it with your husband. It is your body but it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t take what the man your married to for life, says into consideration. \n\nHowever, I also feel having a fear of snakes is serious. But a drawing really shouldn\u2019t constitute any fear he may feel. If you draw a squiggly line, is he going to freak out? \n\nBut YTA. You should take your husbands feelings into account especially if it\u2019s a fear, however silly it may be.", "YTA, assuming he really does have a phobia of snakes.  He is your HUSBAND.  Why would you get a tattoo of something you know he hates?  That's just shitty behavior.  I think your husband respects your right to self-expression through tattoos, but you obviously don't respect him.\n\nLike I have a phobia of strawberry yoohoo, if my partner got a tattoo of that I'd fucking leave him.

Strawberry yoohoo.)", "I mean, I\u2019m wavering between NAH and YTA. \n\nHe has a phobia. He can\u2019t help how he feels about snakes.

Side note, you know what Medusa tattoos symbolize, right?", "I mean, I guess technically NTA as it\u2019s your body. However it does seem short sighted.

Yes it\u2019s your body but if it\u2019s something my husband was absolutely dead set against I would probably try to find a different tattoo that I liked that he didn\u2019t hate just bcuz I wouldn\u2019t want him to get a tattoo that I absolutely hated looking at. Also it being in a kind of intimate spot kinda sends the message of \u201cidc what your opinion is and now you can see it and be reminded that idc every time we get down\u201d, or that\u2019s how I would feel if my husband did it to me. A good compromise would have been to get a piece with different elements where you could have just made the Medusa a part of an overall bigger design, for example like a sun with different smaller things inside of it like birds, fish, and a Medusa, so that it blends to him but you still get the Medusa and a totally unique tattoo.", "YTA Your husband should get a divorce asap.

Despite being able to logically reason that it means nothing I would probably not be able to date/marry someone that had an owl tattoo and would have issues if they had owl motifs in their/our home. This is something that I honestly would bring up early-ish in a relationship. Again it is totally illogical from a modern perspective but owls are a no-go for me.

An irrational fear. It\u2019s still silly.

I only said so because you said a drawing shouldn't matter. One time, I cried because someone made a long filet of Mahi Mahi look like a snake,  even added peppercorns as its eyes. It was ridiculous and embarrassing,  but I couldn't help it.", "Not in the slightest. If she had scorpions all over her he would be cool with it. It's just that he doesn't like snakes.\n\nEdit: I have ravens as they are a symbol of madness and a death head moth as well.

I have to compromise so can he.", "yeah, after reading her response it really seems this is more a punishments than anything else.
