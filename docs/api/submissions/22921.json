There are plenty of images people can and do choose to get that, while still falling under the category of \"your body, your choice,\" makes them an asshole. Racist, sexist or any form of bigoted imagery makes the person choosing them an asshole. \"Your body, your choice\" simply means no one has the right to stop you. It does not mean that what you're doing isn't hurtful.\n\nIn your case, you chose to put a trigger for your husband's phobia in a place he will likely see when he is engaging in a very intimate, vulnerable activity with you.  I would not be surprised if this has a serious impact on your intimacy, sexual and otherwise, with your husband.  Great sex between two loving people often involves each person allowing themselves to be open and vulnerable.  How will your husband do this now that the person he is supposed to be open and vulnerable with has chosen to throw a trigger for his phobia right in his face?\n\nSo I'd say YTA, both to your husband (for being so thoughtless about his phobia and potentially damaging an important intimate relationship for him) and to yourself (for also potentially damaging an intimate relationship for you).  Phobias should never be taken lightly. They are a form of mental illness.", "Gonna agree with the majority and say YTA. I'm not sure why I see so many partners on here obsessed with \"me me me, and mine mine mine.\" A partnership is, well, a partnership. And part of that includes taking your partners needs and feelings into consideration when making decisions. Yes, it's your body, yes, it's your choice. But he did not forbid you, he asked you kindly to take his feelings into consideration, which you did not do, and that's what makes you ta. Relationships are give and take and sometimes we have to give up things we might want or do things we might not want to do, simply out of consideration for our other half. If my husband expressed that he did not want me to do something due to a phobia, I would take that seriously, because I love him, and I also have to live with him lol. There's no reason for me to cause trouble over something that I could just easily avoid by being compassionate to his feelings. If you have a serious serious need for a snake tattoo, you could have gotten something small, or something less visible, but you chose a hand sized tattoo right on your thigh, where he will have to see it every time you undress. That's not taking his feelings into consideration. I would be super annoyed to be faced with my phobia every time my husband undressed. It's just a matter of asking myself, \"would I want him to do this to me?\" If the answer is no, then that's your answer too.", "I feel like maybe you should\u2019ve discussed it with your husband. It is your body but it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t take what the man your married to for life, says into consideration. \n\nHowever, I also feel having a fear of snakes is serious. But a drawing really shouldn\u2019t constitute any fear he may feel. If you draw a squiggly line, is he going to freak out? \n\nBut YTA. You should take your husbands feelings into account especially if it\u2019s a fear, however silly it may be.", "YTA, assuming he really does have a phobia of snakes.  He is your HUSBAND.  Why would you get a tattoo of something you know he hates?  That's just shitty behavior.  I think your husband respects your right to self-expression through tattoos, but you obviously don't respect him.\n\nLike I have a phobia of strawberry yoohoo, if my partner got a tattoo of that I'd fucking leave him.

Strawberry yoohoo.)", "I mean, I\u2019m wavering between NAH and YTA. \n\nHe has a phobia. He can\u2019t help how he feels about snakes.

Also it being in a kind of intimate spot kinda sends the message of \u201cidc what your opinion is and now you can see it and be reminded that idc every time we get down\u201d, or that\u2019s how I would feel if my husband did it to me. A good compromise would have been to get a piece with different elements where you could have just made the Medusa a part of an overall bigger design, for example like a sun with different smaller things inside of it like birds, fish, and a Medusa, so that it blends to him but you still get the Medusa and a totally unique tattoo.", "YTA Your husband should get a divorce asap.

Despite being able to logically reason that it means nothing I would probably not be able to date/marry someone that had an owl tattoo and would have issues if they had owl motifs in their/our home. This is something that I honestly would bring up early-ish in a relationship. Again it is totally illogical from a modern perspective but owls are a no-go for me. Bad medicine and I don\u2019t need any representation of them around me.

Great job buddy.", ">he has to look at it every time you are naked.\n\nJesus Christ, that escalated quickly", "Not us - he's not on reddit lol", "Thanks and good luck! \n\nAnd I feel you on final destination- I get a tiny pang of fear whenever I think about it.", "Butterflies?", "As in, us being in there together", "Can we ask what the image he wants is lol", "I'm also an arachnophobe. Hell, I scared the shit out of myself for about three weeks after getting a shoulder blade tattoo because I can see one tip of a curly music bar and I kept thinking it was a spider. If my husband, also an arachnophobe, got a spider tattoo anywhere ever for some reason, he'd be getting swatted daily with all sorts of stuff around the house!!\n\n\"I didn't mean to hit you with the broom that hard, I keep thinking it's real!\" -- Definitely me.", "Same. I remember visiting my sister and I turned around and saw her boa chilling on her window sill,I screamed. I didn't think she would have it out, and I tended to avoid going in the room where the tanks were. Sometimes snakes pop into my dreams and I wake up sweaty and scared.\nI was chased with a dead adder (UK) when I was a child and have had a phobia ever since. \n\nOP, you're the AH. Until you have this phobia, you wouldn't understand, but maybe educate yourself.", "NTA if he can look at snakes in the reptile house then this tattoo should be whatever", "ah ok my bad im really sorry about that . i reckon this is still a bit cruel though , like your body your choice but a phobia really is an awful thing to have and you really cant blame him for being upset . im going NAH since it actually has significance but your husband does have every right to be upset .", "you could have gotten it smaller, or on another part of your body? like if you have long hair, on the back of your neck where it is hidden and then when your husband isn't with you, you could tie up your hair to show it.", "Childhood cartoon engaged in a kink is the furthest I'm willing to go.", "My back was a hard no for tattoo areas (that was his choice).

A grown man just simply cannot bear to look at an image, and that makes you a piece of shit?  \n\nI'm really trying to understand here.  Does he just not like looking at em, or does he literally throw up?  All the top comments are treating this like an act of physical violence.  It's a picture.  You said it's not even photorealistic.\n\nUnless it literally causes him to have a seizure or something when he looks at it, you're not an asshole.", "i meant your nape, like neck, or was that off limits too? i could think of a couple more spots on the body that are more \"hidden\" where the tattoo wouldn't immediately jump out at him", "How are you compromising?\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t care why are you posting and why are you even married to him?", "So you\u2019re punishing him for his mothers words?", "Dealing with your in laws is difficult to avoid and reasonable to ask.

That would really kill my sex drive, yknow, seeing something that triggers me on his naked body and knowing that he doesn't care. I would seriously be considering a divorce if that matched other patterns of similar behaviour.\n\n It doesn't matter if it has an intended sumbolic meaning, the practical effect is that you asked if you should get it, he said \"please don't that would make me really uncomfortable\" and you got something that will make your hisband deeply uncomfortable permanently etched on you.

Grow up.", "I am curious, what intended symbolic meaning were you going for when getting a medusa a tattoo that just couldn't have been kept aside for a genuine phobia your husband has for snakes? As far as I am aware, a medusa tattoo is a common tattoo for SA survivors as Medusa had to go through the same. \nI am all for bodily autonomy but then you also should be sensitive and respectful towards your SO's issue with it.", "Well then make a chronological insight paper and publish it somewhere else.

Why are you acting like this is life or death or like a judgment from AITA means anything at all in the real world?", "It seems like a lot of projection to me to be honest.
