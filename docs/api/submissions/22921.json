He only asked you for one thing, and you disregarded it with \"it's my body, right? \n\nIt seems like you don't know how to compromise. \n\nYou probably don't have any phobias if you don't understand your husband's position in this.", "If your sex life dies, know that it is your fault. YTA", "YTA. Your husband was really against it b/c he finds snakes abhorrent. It feels almost passive-aggressive to go ahead & get anyway. You must not value his opinion at all. Begs the question, why are you even married to him?", "Sure it's your body, your choice, but that doesn't mean you're not an asshole for your choice.  There are plenty of images people can and do choose to get that, while still falling under the category of \"your body, your choice,\" makes them an asshole. Racist, sexist or any form of bigoted imagery makes the person choosing them an asshole. \"Your body, your choice\" simply means no one has the right to stop you. It does not mean that what you're doing isn't hurtful.\n\nIn your case, you chose to put a trigger for your husband's phobia in a place he will likely see when he is engaging in a very intimate, vulnerable activity with you.  I would not be surprised if this has a serious impact on your intimacy, sexual and otherwise, with your husband.  Great sex between two loving people often involves each person allowing themselves to be open and vulnerable.  How will your husband do this now that the person he is supposed to be open and vulnerable with has chosen to throw a trigger for his phobia right in his face?\n\nSo I'd say YTA, both to your husband (for being so thoughtless about his phobia and potentially damaging an important intimate relationship for him) and to yourself (for also potentially damaging an intimate relationship for you).  Phobias should never be taken lightly. They are a form of mental illness.", "Gonna agree with the majority and say YTA. I'm not sure why I see so many partners on here obsessed with \"me me me, and mine mine mine.\" A partnership is, well, a partnership. And part of that includes taking your partners needs and feelings into consideration when making decisions. Yes, it's your body, yes, it's your choice. But he did not forbid you, he asked you kindly to take his feelings into consideration, which you did not do, and that's what makes you ta. Relationships are give and take and sometimes we have to give up things we might want or do things we might not want to do, simply out of consideration for our other half. If my husband expressed that he did not want me to do something due to a phobia, I would take that seriously, because I love him, and I also have to live with him lol. There's no reason for me to cause trouble over something that I could just easily avoid by being compassionate to his feelings. If you have a serious serious need for a snake tattoo, you could have gotten something small, or something less visible, but you chose a hand sized tattoo right on your thigh, where he will have to see it every time you undress. That's not taking his feelings into consideration. I would be super annoyed to be faced with my phobia every time my husband undressed. It's just a matter of asking myself, \"would I want him to do this to me?\" If the answer is no, then that's your answer too.", "I feel like maybe you should\u2019ve discussed it with your husband. It is your body but it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t take what the man your married to for life, says into consideration. \n\nHowever, I also feel having a fear of snakes is serious. But a drawing really shouldn\u2019t constitute any fear he may feel. If you draw a squiggly line, is he going to freak out? \n\nBut YTA. You should take your husbands feelings into account especially if it\u2019s a fear, however silly it may be.", "YTA, assuming he really does have a phobia of snakes.  He is your HUSBAND.  Why would you get a tattoo of something you know he hates?  That's just shitty behavior.  I think your husband respects your right to self-expression through tattoos, but you obviously don't respect him.\n\nLike I have a phobia of strawberry yoohoo, if my partner got a tattoo of that I'd fucking leave him.

Strawberry yoohoo.)", "I mean, I\u2019m wavering between NAH and YTA. \n\nHe has a phobia. He can\u2019t help how he feels about snakes.

Side note, you know what Medusa tattoos symbolize, right?", "I mean, I guess technically NTA as it\u2019s your body. However it does seem short sighted.

Yes it\u2019s your body but if it\u2019s something my husband was absolutely dead set against I would probably try to find a different tattoo that I liked that he didn\u2019t hate just bcuz I wouldn\u2019t want him to get a tattoo that I absolutely hated looking at. Also it being in a kind of intimate spot kinda sends the message of \u201cidc what your opinion is and now you can see it and be reminded that idc every time we get down\u201d, or that\u2019s how I would feel if my husband did it to me. A good compromise would have been to get a piece with different elements where you could have just made the Medusa a part of an overall bigger design, for example like a sun with different smaller things inside of it like birds, fish, and a Medusa, so that it blends to him but you still get the Medusa and a totally unique tattoo.", "YTA Your husband should get a divorce asap.

Despite being able to logically reason that it means nothing I would probably not be able to date/marry someone that had an owl tattoo and would have issues if they had owl motifs in their/our home. This is something that I honestly would bring up early-ish in a relationship. Again it is totally illogical from a modern perspective but owls are a no-go for me. Bad medicine and I don\u2019t need any representation of them around me.

I don't think he's ever sought therapy for snakes as we don't have wild snakes where we live.

You know a woman can be sexuallt assaulted by anyone?", "I know it does why do you think I got it?", "Yes that's why I got it.", "So when he was a kid he was at the zoo and a keeper had a snake that snapped at him. For years he wouldn't yo near them.\n\n20 years or so later on a date at the zoo we wonder into the reptile enclosure and he tells me the story and says he's a lot better now but they have to be in a cage.\n\nOther than mentioning it re the tattoo it honestly doesn't come up, I can't think of a film we've watched thar heavily involved snakes and we don't have wild snakes around us. So it's hard to gauge perfectly.", "Weirdly I have a phobia of heights (and it is bad, like panic attacks and fully freezing) and we still go hill walking/hiking in mountains. I just allow myself to panic through it/stare at things that aren't a sheer drop. I've been full on facing it so we aren't limited on weekend activities.", "I do like my husband. But I also really wanted the tattoo for many reasons.", "Yes and that's why I adore her/got it. \n\nI didn't go into details in my post because its just not something I'm going to goninto detail on.", "Not enough, it seems, if you think his phobia is silly and not worth consideration. Ironic, given the tattoo is ostensibly for dealing with your own trauma. There was no way to do that without triggering him?\n\nBased on your other comments I have to ask: is this partly a punishment for your husband for failing to adequately defend you from his mother's barbs? Or are you punishing his mother, by getting a tattoo she is unlikely to ever see?", "He might not like you as much anymore.", "Wait wtf? How old are you? 15?? Is it legal to teenager have a husband?", "I always think if you can't have a picture as a lock screen or wallpaper on your phone, you shouldn't be tattooing in anywhere on your body.", "I have a fear spider , if my SO got a spice Tatto I would probably have a mini-heart attack anytime I saw it", "Don\u2019t make jokes OP. All the comments agree. What you did was selfish and cruel to your husband.", "With this response, I actually think you and your husband will get over this, lol. Yeah, maybe you should've talked more about it, maybe helped him a bit to come to terms with it or something. But all in all, it's a tattoo. None of us knows the ins and outs of your life together except this one incident. For all we know, OP's husband might be over it already. The comments I've read coming from OP, there's a reason she got this specifically, and if it's anything close to Medusa's story, it seems like it was some heavy shit. \n\nOP, maybe talk with your husband a bit more. See how he is and see how you can help him get past it. It's gonna be work, but I think it'll be fine.", "Because people are assuming he had a full blown phobia, but from what you\u2019ve said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t like snakes\u201d is more accurate of a description. \n\nI have a phobia. If my husband got a tattoo of my phobia, I would literally have a panic attack every time I saw it. I would be nervous and on edge whenever there was a chance I even might see it. I genuinely could not ever have sex with him again. People who have phobias are assuming this is how it would be for your husband, too\u2026 but it\u2019s not, at all, so ofc it sounds silly to you both. \n\nAnyway, there\u2019s just a disconnect, that\u2019s all.", "It's okay I didn't expect the actual tattoo. Tbh even as an outline a few of the snake's heads have a realistic look to them since the art is really good but I don't think it's a big deal. That being said I'm used to a lot of people saying they have a snake phobia when really they just don't want to hold one or are just regular old scared. I don't want you to feel like you have to disclose your husband's business (unless he knows about the post and he's cool with it) but maybe you should talk to him about where his fear is coming from? He may have a legitimate reason for having a phobia or maybe he just has a phobia and can't control it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if that's the case I could see why you feel like an AH. Although if you find out that he just thinks snakes are gross or he doesn't want to be around them then that's not your fault and then the tattoo doesn't seem like a big deal.", "I dunno if being mad about it, is worth much in the grand scheme of things.  \n\nI also don't see it as my business, if getting it is important to him.", "Yes. But typically, partners of victims support their trauma healing. Your husband hating your survivor tattoo will make it look like there's more to the story .. honestly just leave him, your comments make it clear that he isn't a priority to you.", "Well, I guess I\u2019d say you should\u2019ve discussed more before you decided to get it. Is your relationship more important than a tattoo of something you like?", "Wow you're right I better go divorce him immediately.", "Looks like you're both awful!\\~ Hope someone close to you violates your trust and fears by doing something dumb and superficial!", "It's silly for the ones that don't have it. It's something they can't control.", "I mean if there was a snake in the room he would run screaming, unless it was in a cage.", "It came from when he was a kid. He was at a zoo and a keeper was holding a snake and it snapped at him. For years he didn't ever go to the snake section of a zoo.\n\nFast forward 20 years and we are on a date and wonder into the reptile enclosure, he told me the story and said he's more chill now but they have to be in a cage for him to be ok.\n\nIt rarely comes up in our day to day lives, we haven't watched any films with snakes as a big feature. Thr only time it has come uo is when I said I wanted the tattoo.", "Op shouldn't need to have a discussion with her husband about the body shaming, that should be something he was shutting down long before now.\n\n I don't know about you, but my partners don't need to come to me if somebody is body shaming them to ask me to get them to stop, because I'm already on top of it. Either that, or I just don't bring my partner around them anymore, and limit my contact with them in general.\n\nOn the other hand, yes she should most definitely address the issue herself, instead of asking her husband to do it. But if he's going to do it, he should be doing it voluntarily on his own without being asked.\n\nI do think that she should have listened to him a bit more and taken his feelings into consideration, but telling her that she needs to tell her husband to tell his mom to stop body shaming her, when if he actually loved her as much as he claims to he would be shutting it down himself, is a little much. In my personal opinion.", "Girl. Why did you post here if you arent willing to accept when people tell you that this is not a thing you do to someone you like. YTA. Just because you have the freedom to do something doesn't make it Not a Dick Move.", "You sound so insufferable", "I think you think you are coming off as pithy, but really you just sound like more and more of an asshole OP.", "Yes I understand. I find it silly but that is because I do not have the phobia. But I do understand. And I recognize it\u2019s irrational.", "Sure, so would a lot of people. Maybe even most.\n\nThat\u2019s not the same thing as someone who is so irrationally terrified that even a picture will make them panic, which is genuinely how bad phobias can get. It\u2019s not fear, exactly, it\u2019s more like a very specific panic disorder.", "So why did you bring it up when I didn\u2019t?", "Going off of what you're saying here I just want to pitch an example out. Imagine if it was a golden retriever that snapped at him? Would we be having this same conversation about a wolf tattoo you wanted? If he can stand to see real snakes behind a wall of glass then I don't see why he even cares about this tattoo. Medusa isn't around to actually be a problem for him, but he willingly went into a reptile exhibit where things can and have gone wrong? I know people are really upset with you right now, I guess they don't like snakes either, but the math ain't mathin \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Maybe divorce if neither if u supports the other.

He's not responsible for her bad behavior.\n\nYou ARE responsible for intentionally getting his phobia on your body", "yeah no trying to turn your huge fuck up into \"well I suffer at your hands too!\" when the issues are not related is really immature. I broke up with my first bf for always doing that, because at age 18 I knew it was immature as fuck.  \n\n\nThe sensible thing to do is to get the thing removed or covered up with a diff thing tbh. Either way you owe him a genuine and huge apology.  \n\n\nThe MIL thing is shit but that can be deal with as it is - a separate issue with nothing to do with this.  \n\n\nYTA", "If you don\u2019t care, why post in this forum?", "No, she shouldn't have to have the discussion with him, but on the same token, if he's not supporting her, she needs to have the discussion.  But she's now playing tit for tat - which is petty of her.", "How would you feel if he got a \"40 BMI...\" tattoo on him? Something his significant other is not comfortable with to be reminded and also something he has to live with. Subtle reminder of his mothers concerns too. :)", "There's YTA then there's speculating about Mt wex life. The rules or this group say be civil and I think speculating qbout the sex life of someone who is sharing in comments they got the tattoo due to its inteneed symbolic meaning is uncivil.\n\nSp yeah globes are off.

You're just grasping at straws to be outraged and consider yourself N T A", "Interesting that you jump to \"welp gotta divorce\" instead of, I don't know, considering having a grown-up conversation with your partner about where you might be letting each other down? If you're so keen to avoid communication then yeah, I have to agree with you, divorce might be the best option. There must be a 24/7 divorce option somewhere.\n\nA lot of people, myself included, haven't touched your sex life. If you choose to be offended by their comments when dealing with everyone, that is of course your prerogative. It still makes you insufferable, as already pointed out.

Then now your upset thats not how it worked out, AH.", "I don\u2019t care where it is on her thigh, their sex life is irrelevant to the conversation and it\u2019s weird to me that so many people are using that as their point. There are relationships with low libidos or no desire for sexual intimacy, there are relationships with high libidos, we don\u2019t know shit about their sex life so why are you guys bringing it up especially when she has clearly shown that it makes her uncomfortable that it\u2019s the focus? My judgement was made with ZERO comment or thought about it, because I don\u2019t know their business so how am I supposed to know if that\u2019s even a factor that could be messed with and even if I did know why would it be my place to talk about something so personal? Just because she is asking for opinions on the tattoo situation doesn\u2019t mean she wants opinions on her intimate life that she didn\u2019t even bring up.\n\nIf we were bringing up irrelevant things, I would have said something in my comment about how medusa tattoos are a symbol for survivors of sexual crimes, but since she didn\u2019t bring up whether she researched it or knew it, it\u2019s not my place to ask or wonder about whether she knows as that can instantly reveal that she is a survivor (if so) and that is something that is not my place to speak about. Yes, I\u2019m mentioning it here but it is purely as an example and I am not replying to OP directly about it. Hopefully that explains why I say it\u2019s strange to me that so many comments are related to it \u2014 words are not my strong suit.", "Perhaps. But I don\u2019t care.", "Right, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. People are misunderstanding the situation because they thought you meant he had an actual anxiety disorder. That\u2019s all. :)", "no one is painting you as anything, in this specific scenario you are def being the bad guy!

I actually began with a question to spark self reflection. I then backed it up with an observational comparison of your behavior. Your continued defensiveness and \"I know you are, but what am I\" response has answered the initial question. \n\nSince you apparently don't understand how fears work. Yes, a simple picture can cause a reaction. Even a mere thought can actually trigger a fear response. It causes anxiety depending on the severity. Others aren't on your side because you chose to put aside the fact that it would plague his fears. Instead, willfully choosing to be the cause of his anxiety. \n\nThe one who pointed out the false equivalency was saying that you're holding against him the actions of another to excuse your own actions. Judging how you go at others, I don't honestly see someone who's too concerned with what his mother says or thinks. While others who you believe are so \"worried about your sex life\" were simply telling you that should things change between the two of you, then you only have yourself to blame. \n\nDid I spell it out for you well enough or use too many big words? Now, that was an insult to your intelligence. Please proceed to come back at me if you wish. I'm an admitted asshole who truly couldn't care less.", "THAT TOO", "Look at the comments there are LOADS od them", "I think not caring is fine, it just means your very inconsiderate. you just shouldnt be surprised when nobody comes to help you when you need it.", "Thanks.
