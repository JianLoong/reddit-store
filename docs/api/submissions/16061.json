These issues have a way of exploding on everyone involved. You are right, it is not your responsibility to help this relationship. This is on Jess now. It\u2019s not worth the stress.", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe it to your stepsister to be her peacemaker. Your stepdad is understandably very upset, and he made a choice to deal with it. Your stepdad gravitates towards people who are ready and willing to make a loving space for him, not force him to crouch behind bushes and wait for a time to allowed to be with people who supposedly love him. It's incredibly humiliating. Don't budge on your stance.", "Great script I read elseweb: \"this is really complicated and I'm not qualified.

If she is going to do everything according to her mum's wishes and as a result her dad is being expected to adjust all his plans, she's pretty stupid for being surprised that her dad isn't on board.

But she asked me to try to persuade him into still visiting her and tell him how sad she is, as she thinks he'll listen if more people tell him he's being unreasonable.\n\nHonestly, fuck her for that.\n\nLike, even up to the venting I would have said no assholes. She invited both parents, but then prioritized her mothers feelings and made it extremely untenable for him to drive hours to be there for two minutes and then dip so a grown ass woman in his age category wouldn't have to be uncomfortable for a couple hours. Even in spite of how iffy this is I would have said no assholes.\n\nHowever, I **hate** the flying monkey routine. She contacted you purely to get you on side and sink her manipulative little needles into her dad by proxy. So screw that.\n\n>I didn't think this was a fair ask. \n\nBecause it isn't. It's a shitty manipulative tactic, frequently used by narcissists I might add, not that I'm saying she is one. I'm just saying, it's used by them for a reason.\n\n>Jess got upset and told me she's not asking for much, she just wants to see her dad and get him to see his grandbaby and needs someone to advocate for her.\n\nNo, what she wants is for people to collectively harass him on her behalf, it's by proxy bullying.\n\n>I just want to know if I'm being an asshole as I feel terrible.\n\nIma be blunt. Literally the only reason you probably feel bad is because she called you in tears and hysterical. You, like any other human being on this earth, are driven to respond to the intensity of another persons emotions. This is sometimes a good thing, and sometimes a bad thing. In this case it's bad, because a part of you is saying she's sympathetic purely because of her state, but the request isn't different just because she's upset. It's the same request with no greater emergency than the day before.\n\nThis is also not a zero sum dilemma situation. Again, she's only in this position because she prioritized her mothers feelings over her fathers, and is disregarding his in this situation. She could easily tell her mother to just deal with seeing her ex for a couple hours things would easily be different, and if her mother won't go because of that then it's another matter. She has created this situation and she has to deal with it.\n\nNTA", "Nta you tried to set a boundary and she disrespected you by crossing it, then tried to manipulate you", "NTA. This is a really tough situation. Divorce is messy and leaves kids (even grown ones) in unreasonable situations. I think both her mom and dad (your step dad) are actually the assholes here. They clearly haven't worked out their issues even though I assume it's been years since they divorced. \n\nIf they can't prioritize their own child and come up with a reasonable solution so as to not force their daughter to choose between them, especially if they're using the grandchild as a bartering chip here--thats on THEM. They both need to grow up and have an adult conversation to get over themselves. I'd say if you're going to do anything here (which you REALLY don't have to do), mentioning to your step dad that it would be worth redirecting his frustration onto his ex wife and not his daughter/grandchild who is caught in the middle. \n\nBut seriously, only do that if you feel like you have the kind of relationship with your step dad that he would be able to hear that without straining your own relationship. Depending on what caused his prior marriage to end he may actually have some things to apologize for, but then again he might not. \n\nThis seems like a really messy situation that you are best served not getting involved with at all--though if you value your relationship with your step sister it might be worth reaching back out and offering some sympathy alongside a more clear set of boundaries for your relationship (very reasonable to not want to get involved in their family drama, and I think you could gently apologize for snapping (even if it was justified, I'm sure her feelings are genuinely hurt in this difficult scenario) and more calmly explain that you're not the best person to get dragged into this and your opinion would likely only inflame family tensions).\n\nBest of luck op", "NTA.

These are your steps who are only recently in your life and not close so her ask was inappropriate. \n\nI think step-dad is right not to visit since she was offering him time here and there, when it didn't conflict with her mom. \n\nStep-dad is also right to repurpose the time with your mom.\n\nStep sis is TA.
