I don't have what I'd say is a close relationship with him but he's a decent guy and he makes my mom happy.\n\nHe has a daughter Jess, f28. Me and Jess never really spent much time together. She lives quite far away. \n\nI know she doesn't have a close relationship with her dad and her parents split up when she was young, too.\n\nFor Christmas and birthdays my stepdad will make the drive over to Jess' place and stay in a hotel for a few nights.\n\nMy stepdad planned on visiting Jess in a couple of weeks, as it will be her son's 4th birthday. This was planned well in advance according to my stepdad.\n\nHe and Jess got into a very heated argument over the phone the other night because, apparently, Jess changed her mind and is now deciding to throw a big party for her son. \n\nHer mom is going to be there for the majority of the time and doesn't want to see him. So now Jess only wants him to visit at very specific times to make her mom happy, which he wasn't on board with.\n\nMy stepdad got super mad and told Jess she can forget about him coming to visit her if she and his ex wife can't be adults about it.\n\nHe already booked the time off work so my stepdad planned a small trip with my mom instead.\n\nYesterday, Jess messaged me on WhatsApp. She basically vented to me out of nowhere about what an asshole her dad is, and explained that she's just trying to keep both her mom and dad happy.\n\nAll of the stuff I've heard about their conflict was a bunch of \"he said, she said\" on both sides.\n\nI did feel a bit bad for Jess. But she asked me to try to persuade him into still visiting her and tell him how sad she is, as she thinks he'll listen if more people tell him he's being unreasonable.\n\nI didn't think this was a fair ask. I apologised to her and told her I understand she's in a difficult spot family-wise but it's not my job to get involved. I've never been particularly close with her or her dad.\n\nJess got upset and told me she's not asking for much, she just wants to see her dad and get him to see his grandbaby and needs someone to advocate for her.\n\nI left her on read for a couple of hours, I did intend to respond but I wasn't sure what to say yet, but then she sent me another couple messages telling me to just forget it and that I wouldn't understand anyway.\n\nToday, Jess phoned me and was crying. She vented to me again and just went on about how she needs my help persuading her dad. I tried my best to be patient with her whilst telling her no, and that this is something they need to sort among themselves. She was absolutely hysterical and refusing to listen to me.\n\nI couldn't take it anymore and just told her that this is her and her dad's problem, and hung up the phone.
