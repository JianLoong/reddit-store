I'm good with 1-2x a month. My husband stops by more often.\n\n\nAnd why are you guys always doing the packing up & driving?", "NTA. Inheriting family can be hard and we all need a break sometimes. As long as you aren\u2019t rude about it you are well within your right. Do you and her get out of the house together to have fun without them? Because she seemed to be implying you don\u2019t.", "NTA for wanting time away from your in laws.\n\nAsk her if you can plan a whole weekend, where you will plan AND execute activities out of the house and balance some at home time (where she gets a break!). She probably makes plans with in laws because they're easy, she doesn't have to take the entire mental load on with planning what to do, what to bring, etc. \n\nI get it", "NTA. But this does need to be nipped in the bud. You need to start your own family traditions with just your wife and child. Otherwise you will be spending every weekend, holiday, and vacation with the in-laws. When will you have time to do work around the house, read a book, or take a long nap? Are you spending the entire weekend with them?", "NAH If you don't want her to fill your weekends with family plans that include your inlaws every weekend then you should take the initiative and plan some special activities for just the three of you.  Next week look at the calendar of events in your community and find a fall fair, or apple orchard with a petting zoo, or a pumpkin patch and corn maze, and set up a plan for your family of three and then tell her you have a special family activity planned that day for the three of you.  Problem solved: you get some family time without the in laws and she gets a fun weekend activity.", "NTA. If you don\u2019t care if she goes alone with the baby, she should do that but insisting your family time is spent with your in-laws every weekend, you\u2019re going to start resenting them which isn\u2019t good for any of you. She needs to re-think this for the good of your relationship with her parents.", "NTA don\u2019t go. Stay home. Tell your partner to have fun with their family alone and you go with the child out for fun activities. Put your foot down!!!", "NTA, if something is too much.

Your wife can go see your parents by herself. Or her and the kid can go. Or, her parents can come visit you. I know you said your place is too small to host people for long visits, but that's the point and to your advantage. I'm sure it's plenty spacious enough to host the parents for a lunch, or a 45-minute Sunday afternoon visit.\n\nPut an end to this weekly nonsense, or you're going to go nuts. Find something you can do by yourself on the weekends and let them have at it. Take up golf. Play tennis. Buy a motorcycle and take long solo rides. Anything.\n\nNTA.", "We do the packing because we have a smaller place, not really suitable for hosting 3+ guests for a long period of time. That\u2019s something that I think is contributing to my partner feeling the need to get out every weekend. Which again I totally understand but I\u2019ve never been the type of person who needs to be out and about all the time, and I need a break lol. 1-2x per month sounds great, I have petitioning for that but my partner\u2019s not in the mood to compromise on it. Wish I could say \u201cthe other redditors don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unreasonable\u201d \ud83d\ude02 but thank you for the validation, was starting to feel like the asshole the more her and I butt heads on this.", "This! I would also point out that it is also on you to arrange things so maybe plan a weekend as just a family unit away from the house and enjoy it. The more fun you have together will make it more attractive to your partner and will likely make her want more alone time.", "She was making a comment that during the work week, we don\u2019t get out as much, and it\u2019s unfair for me to ask that we don\u2019t go out to her family\u2019s place over the weekend.  But in all fairness we don\u2019t even get home from work and settled in until around 6, from there I have to cook dinner and then clean up from the day so that doesn\u2019t leave us with much time to do anything. Is it bad to just have a weekend where you hang at home and just do minimal activities? Essentially like a lazy Sunday type vibe?", "Thank you, that\u2019s good advice, maybe if I take on the responsibility of planning out our weekends she won\u2019t feel the \u201ccabin fever\u201d so much", "Can you just stay home & relax a few weekends a month?", "Very true. Make memories.", "Sounds like you need some weekends where you come with her to her parents', some weekends where you stay home by yourself and recharge, and some weekends where you suggest specific alternate plans to do together as a family.\n\nIf she doesn't like spending weekends sitting at home, that's fine, but she should respect that you don't like spending every weekend sitting around her parents' house.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners respect the other's needs and want to make sure those needs are met.", "I absolutely think this would help! I'm the planner in my family and I would love to have my spouse say \"I got a babysitter and I'm taking you out\" or \"I thought we could pack a lunch and go to the park at 10am today. Sound good?\"", "That\u2019s essentially what I\u2019m asking her for, from her perspective it\u2019s an unfair ask because during the workweek we spend most of our nights either at home or at the playground across the street. I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019m probably going to start saying \u201cI\u2019m going to hang back because I need some time at home\u201d but didn\u2019t want her to feel like I\u2019m sticking her with the baby. The baby hanging back with me is not an option because \u201cshe\u2019s not going to keep the baby from her parents\u201d", "Right! Just a healthier balance of activities would be a game changer for sure", "The baby hanging back with you is an option she \"chooses\" not to take advantage of. Maybe becausei it would upset her parents.\n\nI'd find a way to compromise. Maybe you can offer her the \"free time\" you're seeking in exchange. So you each get personal time.", "That\u2019s definitely a good suggestion, I suspect part of her wanting to go to her parents often is because of the time off from the baby that comes with Grandparent time. Maybe a compromise along those lines would work. Definitely agree that she is choosing not to take advantage of my offers to keep the baby home, trying to find a happy medium. But compromising isn\u2019t a strong suit of ours", "I'm sure her parents are helpful. The responsibility of a toddler can be exhausting. I bet she would love a worry free break. It's a give and take."]}
