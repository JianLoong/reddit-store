She has many friends in the city I live in, so she visits occasionally. Though we meet for a meal when she comes into town, the primary reason for her trips is to see her friends. This makes me sad, as I love my sister and often prioritize family over what I want and I don\u2019t feel she does the same.\n\nMy sister suffers from classic youngest-child syndrome; she can be prone to thoughtlessness because someone is usually around to account for her mistakes. For example, my family and I were out to lunch one day when she was a senior in high school and she ordered a dish with dairy in it. She is severely lactose intolerant but can have dairy if she takes Lactaid. After I pointed this out she asked our mom for a Lactaid, as she carries them in her purse for when my sister forgets to carry them. I ask what she would do in college without mom, and my sister said something to the effect of \u201cwell, my friends know that I\u2019m lactose intolerant, so they\u2019ll carry it for me.\u201d\n\nMy sister also has very poor eyesight. Not blind, but her eyesight is Velma from Scooby Doo I-can\u2019t-see-without-my-glasses bad. This means she can\u2019t drive without glasses.\n\nShe visited town this past weekend to party with her friends. We met for dinner, and I assured her that if needed me that night I could come get her and she could crash no problem, and I also offered to take her to brunch the next morning. She said that she appreciated it but she was here to spend time with her friends and that she has a ton of homework so she\u2019d be going straight home in the morning. I vented about my disappointment in this to my mom on the phone later, and she said \u201cit\u2019s okay if your sister wants to spend time with her friends. you should make plans with yours,\u201d so I did.\n\nThe next morning, I\u2019m getting ready for brunch with my friends, and I get a call from my sister. She wore daily contacts driving into town, didn\u2019t bring any solution, and forgot her glasses, so she couldn\u2019t drive herself home. She wanted me to drop my plans for the day to drive her 2.5 hrs to her city to pick up her glasses and drive her 2.5 hrs back so she could drive her car home. Admittedly, upset about the previous night, I said that if her friends were her priority she should ask one of them to drive her home. She hangs up; shortly after I receive a call from my mother, chewing me out for not taking care of my sister. We exchange words and she hangs up.\n\nMy parents were driving home from a vacation that day, and there was an alternate route they could take to pick up my sister on the way home, but this would add two hours to their trip. That\u2019s what they end up doing, they take the longer route, pick up my sister and her car, then drive her home.\n\nI thought I was justified in how I acted and my friends agree but my whole family is giving me the cold shoulder.

Sounds like your mother has never made your sister responsible for taking care of her own basic needs, which has allowed your sister to play the helpless maiden in distress and expect everyone to drop everything so she doesn\u2019t have to take responsibility for herself.  Your sister\u2019s behavior would be understandable in a young child, but your mom has enabled it for much longer than is anything resembling reasonable.  Refusing to tend to the problem your mother has allowed is entirely reasonable.  Your sister will never learn better until she grows up, and it sounds like that won\u2019t happen until everyone stops enabling her.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are mad that they had to make a 2 hour detour, but they find it fine for you to take a 5 hour trip in a giant circle?\n\nI've never worn contacts, but why can't she get the fluid locally?

It was an unreasonable request from an entitled little girl.", "NTA\nSister needs to take responsibility for her actions and inability to plan", "NTA\n\nCongratulations for your parents on creating an adult child who can't survive on her own.

I keep a couple of extra pairs of my daily contacts in my makeup bag in my purse (along with those other random things you might need like Lactaid or hair ties or menstrual products) so that I can take care of myself. \n\nShe has learned that there is no need for self-reliance or preparation because someone will always be there to catch her when she falls.

You had plans. She should be more responsible.", "NTA\n\nAlso younger sibling, also more medically fragile than my sibling and different gender. From about the age of 13, the only thing I've ever asked my mum when out and about for is paracetamol and pads, on the rare occasion I've forgotten them at home. This very basic adulting. And I'm an adult with short term memory problems. \n\nI can't help wondering if this is this learned helplessness on your sisters part or deliberate? Because my mum did coddle me but she also prepared me for the real world: and I'm now the friend that has plasters, para, a spare pen, pads etc etc. I think your sister needs to buck up a fair bit tbh.", "NTA. Those eye charts, with the comically big letters at the top? Yeah, without my glasses I can read the second, maybe third row (left eye only? I'm guessing that huge letter at the top). My vision has been this way since I was a teen. I tell you this for context.\n\n*Glasses and contacts are literally my link to sight*. I keep a pair of dailies in my wallet and an old pair of glasses in my car for if there's some kind of disaster and I need to drive home. If I'm caught without my glasses/contacts? *I may as well have left my eyes at home*.\n\nYour sister has so little personal responsibility that in her *day to day life* she could effectively *render herself blind and/or sick* and has no problem with this. Stop being part of the problem. I know you love your sister and want to spend time with her, but tough love is what she needs. If she comes to see her friends and wants your help with something or to stay with you? \"Sorry, I'm busy that weekend.\" She has an \"emergency\" that her own negligence has created? \"Sorry, I'm doing something time sensitive right now.\" At least teach her that there won't always be someone around to bail her out.", "NTA.

She shouldn't have gotten onto you for not \"taking care\" of your sister.

If this was a one time \"oh shit I forgot\" thing, I'd get it. But it seems this behavior is habitual. She needs to grow up, and your mom needs to stop enabling behavior that's going to end up hurting her as a human in the long run. \n\nGood luck OP.", "NTA thy sister causes too much work also contact lenses", "Did it not occur to anyone to buy some contact solution?", "ESH.
