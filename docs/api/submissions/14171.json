It was her first day and it did not leave a good first impression\n\nHAHAHAH WHAT?!?! \n\nMan I hate jobs that police what you do after work. She's 25. She had one drink. \n\nAnywho, no it's not your fault. Honestly it's good her manager showed their true colors before she got too deep into the job. NTA", "NTA. You didn't get her fired. Hell she didn't even get her fired because what she did is pretty damn normal. Hopefully she has other prospects on the horizon because something tells me that place would have been shit to work at", "No, TA is her boss.", "NTA. That's a pretty dickish move by the boss. Service industry management on a power trip? Noooooooo never /s\n\nYou're probably doing her a favor honestly", "NTA, it sounds like the boss didn't want her there and used the after work social as an excuse.", "NAH except for the boss.\n\nSince when is it \"highly unprofessional\" to enjoy a drink after you get off work? If anything, *he* set her up to fail by saying it was okay to sit at the bar, thus implying that she could have a meal and drinks if she wanted to, like any other customer.\n\nWhy compliment her so much on her training just to pick someone else? That doesn't make any sense.", "NTA\nI wouldn't want to work for someone who fired me for having a beer.", "NTA, it\u2019s her boss\u2019 fault entirely, he sounds pretty awful honestly - if he decided against keeping your friend at the job for something like this, i don\u2019t even want to imagine how insufferable he must be towards regular employees. neither you nor your friend are at fault", "NTA. Her former employer should be more clear on expectations.", "NTA, the boss sounds like they might be, it was after their shift, they had a meal (if I've read that right) and one drink.\n\nI personally trust places more if the staff eat and drink there, they see the worst of what goes on behind the scenes, if they are still willing to eat and drink there can't be all bad.\n\nPlus sacking someone over text sounds like they have dodged a bullet.", "NTA - Boss was TAH. She could have cleared it with him or gone to another place but those aren't a given when it's your first job.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t your fault she was fired, that was the bosses choice which is confusing since they said she could sit at the bar with you. Technically her being there brought them in your business! Sorry for your friend OP", "NTA. How would either of you have known this would happen? Her boss should have said staff drinking there wasn\u2019t okay if it wasn\u2019t okay. He\u2019s the AH here.", "I've worked in hospitality and I've always had a chill out and a drink after my shift and my colleagues did too. Sure I'm Australian and I can't define what they do in America but that still sounds weird.\n\nMaybe the boss should have communicated better their expectations\n\nNTA", "NTA. The workplace sucked as they led her to believe it was ok. FWIW, I have learned to be extra cautious in the initial weeks and months of a job as you never know what weird rules they have.", "NTA, your friend dodged a bullet.", "NTA \n\nYour friend\u2019s boss, or ex-boss, is the AH. Your friend was off her shift so she should enjoy a drink if she pleases", "NTA. Most non-chain restaurants are typically flattered that people invite their friends/family (as long as they aren\u2019t known to cause issues) as it brings in business and is a great way to network and boost positive reviews. Plus for me, employees eating at said establishment brings me comfort because they see the behind the scenes", "NTA. If she had permission and everything, then no, you didn't get her fired. Sounds like she dodged a bullet with that job", "NTA -  It was after her shift and she was off the clock and on her own time.  Are employees not allowed to eat/drink in the establishment just because they work there?  Sounds like something else was at play and boss used this as an excuse.  There are TONS of jobs out there, she should take this as dodging a bullet (can you imagine working for a boss like that!) and grab one of the hundreds of other service jobs available.  Also, if she was there for paid training, all training should be paid, she WAS HIRED and could file for unemployment.   I do assume she/you paid for everything you consumed and there were no freebies involved and you weren't hogging a table without buying anything when the place was full, if that's not accurate, judgement would change.", "NTA\n\nAnd IN.FO: was she paid for the so-called \u2018training\u2019?", "Well no and I dunno slight yes? The boss had basically given a go ahead for your friend sitting at the bar and having a drink but chose to be more discrete just to be safe and then they go back on their word and say nah that\u2019s unprofessional. That\u2019s stupid what other shit are they gonna go back on? Sick days? Nah probably dodged a bullet with that job but who knows. Then there\u2019s you. You didn\u2019t take into consideration that it may be unprofessional and your friend could\u2019ve declined the drink but didn\u2019t. Just a little can of worms. I think you guys aren\u2019t really at fault but just some insight.", "NTA. At least in my experience it\u2019s pretty normal for restaurant employees to sit at the bar and have a drink after their shift is over? I think she was erring on the side of caution by moving you all to a table and one drink is not really a big deal; I\u2019m surprised he even noticed. Tbh it seems kind of like her boss was testing her by telling her she could sit at the bar to see if she actually would. It feels a bit slimy.", "NTA. \n\nI would rather get a drink from someone who drank (even if occasionally) and knew what to recommend based on what I told them, than someone who never drank and didn't know shit about the drink (flavor) besides the ingredients.", "NTA. You had no way of knowing the boss would fire her for that, because \"don't spend your money at the place where you work\" isn't a normal or rational policy.   \n\n\nI used to work at a supermarket. They never once complained when I did my grocery shop there.", "Nope. NTA. \n\nShe dodged a bullet.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA because you clearly care and your intentions were the opposite of what happened, but yes that was 100% the wrong call for her first day of training. At the same time though she could have left with you as soon as she was done instead of deciding to have a drink.", "Most new employees are on probation for 3 months in North America. Hanging out at your friend's employer's business, waiting for your friend to be free, on their FIRST DAY showed very poor judgement. The employers were probably wondering how often she would have friends hanging out, expecting freebies or discounts, taking her attention away from work in order to chat to you (etc), if she HAD to have a friend standing by on her very first work day. NOT SAYING you would ask or she would give, just offering some insight into the employer's possible mindset. Then to stay at the business after her shift just added more concern. It could appear to the employer that your friend has no life/work balance, and fear that their business has just become her hub, and that she'll be bringing her personal life to work regularly. While I'm sure there was no ill intention on your part or that of your friend, I think you were both pretty clueless about employment/workplace expectations, norms and etiquette.
