You didn't leave them stranded, 4 people will easily fit into 1 car. And even if you had actually left them stranded, you'd still not be the arsehole. They should've at least pretended to care about some of the activities that you wanted to do if they wanted you to ferry them around the whole time. I'm just curious though, have you learned a lesson from this?", "I had a group of friends when I was about 20. I was the only one with a car, and they were always asking me to drive them places. At the time, I was desperate to have friends, so I did what they asked. It became apparent after a few months that my car was the only thing about me that they liked.  The first time I refused to drive them, their true colors came out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese people are not your friends. They are, at best, Uber customers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext time they want a ride somewhere, tell them to pay up front for your time, mileage and gas. Sure, they will call you an asshole, but that is simply them projecting.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t leave them stranded, the other person has a car and can take them back.", "NTA, obviously. Doing drugs in the back of your car is completely unacceptable. You don't owe anyone anything.", "NTA Those don't sound like a friends as much as people who take advantage", "NTA I think this friendship was over long ago and that they've be depending on you for things.", "NTA\n\nThey made you uncomfortable and disregarded your feelings throughout the trip. Get new friends and ignore them if they contact you.", "NTA, these people aren\u2019t friends", "Nta you don't owe them anything. Your also not leaving them stranded. They have a way to get back home. They also decided to not ride back home with you. So that's on them for that.", "Nta you didnt owe them anything", "NTA.\n\nAnd for what it's worth... if people did drugs in my car AGAINST my consent (never-mind without my consent) their trip would have ended on the spot with me kicking them out.\n\nP.S. Those people aren't your friends.", "First of all, everyone should not have to do what others want.

Third, drugs in car = bad, could get you also arrested for that depending on your local laws.  \n\nA big lesson you learn is when to stand up for yourself and walk away.

You admit to not really liking three of them, having a questionable relationship with the closest person, and they like to do things you don\u2019t even want to be around.  Why would you even chose to go under those circumstances?  It\u2019s common for a group to do things that the majority of the group wants to do.

Drop these toxic people and find better friends. And you really need to toughen up. When its your car, you decide the music unless you tell someone to go ahead and pick. But if you don't like it then tell them sorry, they need to pick something else Remember, if you let someone treat you like a doormat, they WILL treat you like a doormat. And yes they are mad, they are losing their chauffer and their doormat.", "> Third, drugs in car = bad, could get you also arrested for that depending on your local laws. \n\nShould be noted that, in the US anyway, regardless of state a passenger dropping their drugs in your car instantly makes those drugs yours as they are on your property and by virtue in your possession.\n\nSomething tells me the people the OP describes aren't the type that would choose someone else's freedom over theirs."]}
