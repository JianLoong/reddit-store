If it's disrespectful when you want to change your last name from your father's to your mother's, what about when a woman is told she needs to change her last name when she gets married? Is that not also disrespectful? I call double standards. I also changed my last name to my mother's last name a few years ago. Both parents are still alive but I have no relationship with my father.

The druggie sperm donor is not a father and likely wont ever know or care if you have a name change. Even if he does who cares, he should have thought of that when he put his lifestyle ahead of his child. Honor the family that raised and supported you. Leave the family that didn't in the past where they belong, they are nobody to you. \n\nNOTE: If you allow your friend to help you financially in this name change then you should 1. Write a hand written Thank You note. 2. Buy her/him a thoughtful gift  3. Put aside a sum of money each week or every two weeks to completely pay back every dime to them, no matter what, even if you have a falling out. This is a point of personal honor and the honor of your family name, don't fail.  Be very grateful this is a huge thing they have offered.", "NTA.\n\nBeing your Dad biologically does not mean he deserves your respect or love. Not to mention, as a friend, they should know that he didn't try. \n\nChange your name, and congrats on your masters.", "NTA. My friends who are brothers changed their last name to their mothers maiden name to honor their grandfather before they got married around the same time. Their dad is alive and around, just kind of a jerk and their half sibling is a felon.", "NTA. I'm not sure why this is even a question. I don't think anyone is an A H for changing their name if that's what they want to do, but in your case it sounds like an especially good idea. Your \"other friend\" is being a complete dick, and is being \"super disrespectful\" of your opinion and values. Graduate with a name you can feel proud of, whether it is from you maternal family or something you take just because you like it.", "NTA. Your friend is an ass though. They act like they were there and living your life. I would personally keep my distance with them. I wish you well with your name change.", "Nta been there done that. The friend who doesn't understand has never been in a position like this and their opinion is irrelevant.", "Fuck tradition.  \nChange your name.  \nNTA", "I changed my surname because I didn't want my dad's name. Never regretted it.", "I changed my first name a while back, welllll into adulthood and a career tied to my name. My only regret is I wish I\u2019d done it sooner!\n\nHad a friend who did the exact thing you did, changing her last name for similar reasons. Same deal; she was a proper adult and just finally figured out to match her name to her (fatherless) life. \n\nNTA at all. One of the funniest things that happened was that I learned loads of my friends had also changed parts of their names at some point not related to marriage/divorce. The cost is annoying, but the liberating thrill of picking out and then being called by your own name never really wears off. \n\nOne small tip: when you\u2019re ready to tell people, do it with confident joy. \u201cI\u2019m doing a thing I\u2019m so excited about and I hope you\u2019ll be as happy for me as I am about my decision.\u201d This knocks back anyone who might come at you sideways. Keep it effusively positive. There\u2019s basically no way for anyone to be rude when you set it up that way. \n\nHope you\u2019ll do something great to celebrate once the paperwork is done! \ud83e\udd73", "And yay to your best friend for her support .  And pooh on the other non good friend.", "NTA. Change your surname!", "NTA  Do what you want.  And hopfully do it once and then keep it marriage or not.   What if it was the other way that we were matriarchial and your mom scooted at 5 and you wanted to change to your dad's name?", "NTA and what a disgraceful ex friend you had.", "NTA. You change your name to whatever you want. It's YOUR name and YOUR decision. Don't bother asking any other opinions. The only one that matters is yours.", "NTA\n\nLMAO I had to laugh at your friend for thinking it\u2019s disrespectful to no longer want to carry the last name of your deadbeat father. Being a sperm donor doesn\u2019t grant you automatic respect, it\u2019s earned. He didn\u2019t earn respect. Change your name to whatever you want. I\u2019m sure your maternal grandparents will be thrilled to hear you want to have their name.", "NTA. It\u2019s a very common thing to change your name to replace that of a deadbeat dad with that of a supportive family. I have several close friends who did that. You are very smart to do it before getting your masters as it will be far more of a pain to have to keep having to explain why the name on the degree doesn\u2019t match your new legal name.", "Did he really \u201ctry\u201d?  Change your name and give the credit to the people who have tried and succeeded. NTA", "Do it. \nYou don't need to respect your father, you choose to respect the family that cared so much for you", "NTA, and congrats OP. Make sure there will be no problem with the institution you are getting the diploma from about changing your surname. Let them know asap so you have one headache to avoid."]}
