A little while ago I (29F) saw a discount flight to a nearby city. It was a 12 hour sale. I have friends in the city and immediately texted them to make plans, which they agreed. I phoned my boyfriend (31M), who I have been with about a year (we don't live together or share finances) if he wanted to come. He told me that he could not afford it right now as things were tight and he had his daughter (4F, not mine) that same weekend. So I went without him.\n\nMy boyfriend is furious with me. He said that since we have been dating for a year and are getting more serious (I've met his daughter and family, we are discussing moving in together next year) that we should make big decisions together and run weekend plans by each other. He also really wanted to visit said city another time, maybe next year. I told him I would be more than happy to visit again next year since I have many friends there. I was gone for a weekend and spent my own money to visit my own friends, so I don't see the issue. I feel like he is being controlling and I did ask him to join me, but he views me as being a bad partner who does not function as a team.\n\nSo Reddit...

You get the final say in what you do. Certainly we all have obligations we need to meet. For instance, my wife and I frequently travel separately. I like to ski, she doesn\u2019t care for it these days. She doesn\u2019t expect me to not plan ski trip with friends. She frequently has long weekend trips with her lifelong best friend (sometimes they even go places that I\u2019d like to visit, but it\u2019s their time and I\u2019m not going to intrude on that). We also travel together as much as possible. The point is that we love and respect each other enough that WANT each other to be able to have these experiences as individuals. It is monumentally important to have a life separate from your partner. It will actually be good for your relationship if you retain some portion of your life exclusively for yourself. Your BF\u2019s reaction is a red flag. IDK if it\u2019s an indication that he will end up to be overly controlling, but it\u2019s entirely possible. Just as likely is that he has some codependency issues. Stick to your guns because you are NTA.", "NTA\n\nLet's translate what happened.  Your \"partner\" effectively said to you.  I am upset that you did not offer to pay for me to go with you on your trip OR that you did not sacrifice your opportunity for me as I was unable to go as well. \n\nThat's literally what was said.

I've been married over a decade and my husband and I go on trips without each other sometimes. I spent two weeks in Europe this summer with my mom and friend, while he stayed home because he didn't want to go. His reaction when I suggested going? Have fun, bring me something pretty. It wasn't something that interested him, but he completely supported me going because I really wanted to. He goes places without me sometimes. We travel together too, don't get me wrong. That's what a healthy relationship should be, not holding someone back from doing things they like just because you can't/ don't want to (assuming affordability and family circumstances, etc.)\n\nIf your boyfriend can't find his way to reason regarding your perfect right to go visit friends without him, that's not a good indicator for what life living with him may be like.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to visit your friends without your bf.

We have been together for 6 years and lived together for 4 years, so basically married without the paperwork. When I want to go somewhere/buy something/etc., I tell him I want to and ask him if he wants to come with me. If it is important for me, such as going to NYC to see a Harry Potter thing, but he doesn't have money for it/not important for him, then he wishes me the best and supports me, but doesn't go. If it is important for him, I support him with money if needed and if he allows me to. If it is important for me that we share this moment together, then I will put more money than he does, and he will try his best to pay me back even though it is not needed.\n\nI think that money can be a breaking point in a relationship, but when there is mutual respect and understanding, it is not. Even when finances/expenses are shared because you are living together, I don't think it should be 50/50 unless both people earn very similar wages and have very similar needs, but both people should be able to spend their own money as they wish, or if it is all in one account, have percentages of it that are assigned to each one to spend as they wish. Otherwise, the idea is to reach a middle point where both members feel taken into account, valued and respected. That is teamwork.\n\nHowever, in your case, it sounds like your partner is just salty, and you should not enjoy something that he cannot enjoy too, and that is selfish on their part. Furthermore, you are not living together yet, so you don't have common expenses and therefore, you should have the right to do whatever you wish with your money, even if it's spending it all in crypto or whatever, even if it is unwise. Even if you were living together and shared expenses, if you already covered your agreed part, your responsibilities and any savings you both agreed to, you should be able to spend what you have left on a trip to a different city or whatever you want. You can invite them to go with you and if they can't because they have other responsibilities, such as his daughter, then you go and that's it! I don't think that makes you a bad partner. I think that just allows you to keep your individuality and personal space while being in a relationship, but it sounds to me that the moment you live together, his responsibilities will become yours, yours will be yours, and your money will only be used for things they approve, and **that's putting yourself on the way of being in a financially abusive relationship, even if you are the one earning more**.", "Nta.

You\u2019re right. \n\nMy thinking is he will just do what you said and learn to cover up his temper better. The next woman will hopefully see it and also run. Cuz that was a stupid thing to get so upset about and a weak excuse he gave as to why.", "That's what helped me as well. I wrote down every shitty thing he had done to me over the years and ended up with a four page long document. I would read that over and over when I started doubting myself as a reminder that it truly was that bad.\n\nIn the end that document played a big part in me finally having the courage to leave.", "This is exactly the comment I came to make. \ud83d\udcaf correct \n\nNTA", "This guy sounds like a grade A loser.

Which is absolutely ridiculous! What is he? 5???", "Yeah, where is that list someone posted, with reasons they break up with a guy, if they do one of them?  I saved it as a jpeg, but don\u2019t know how to post it.  But #3 and #6 seem appropriate!\n\n3. If they try to monopolize my time\u2026.\n\n6.

It proved enlightening.", "This sounds really useful. What is the app?", "I use the free version of Day One (I have Apple so Android mileage may differ). I Googled \u201cfree journaling app\u201d and downloaded the top 3 that kept showing up in different review articles. I tried them all out and then stuck with Day One as it suited me the best."]}
