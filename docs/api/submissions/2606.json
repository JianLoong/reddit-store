A little while ago I (29F) saw a discount flight to a nearby city. It was a 12 hour sale. I have friends in the city and immediately texted them to make plans, which they agreed. I phoned my boyfriend (31M), who I have been with about a year (we don't live together or share finances) if he wanted to come. He told me that he could not afford it right now as things were tight and he had his daughter (4F, not mine) that same weekend. So I went without him.\n\nMy boyfriend is furious with me. He said that since we have been dating for a year and are getting more serious (I've met his daughter and family, we are discussing moving in together next year) that we should make big decisions together and run weekend plans by each other. He also really wanted to visit said city another time, maybe next year. I told him I would be more than happy to visit again next year since I have many friends there. I was gone for a weekend and spent my own money to visit my own friends, so I don't see the issue. I feel like he is being controlling and I did ask him to join me, but he views me as being a bad partner who does not function as a team.\n\nSo Reddit...

You get the final say in what you do. Certainly we all have obligations we need to meet. For instance, my wife and I frequently travel separately. I like to ski, she doesn\u2019t care for it these days. She doesn\u2019t expect me to not plan ski trip with friends. She frequently has long weekend trips with her lifelong best friend (sometimes they even go places that I\u2019d like to visit, but it\u2019s their time and I\u2019m not going to intrude on that). We also travel together as much as possible. The point is that we love and respect each other enough that WANT each other to be able to have these experiences as individuals. It is monumentally important to have a life separate from your partner. It will actually be good for your relationship if you retain some portion of your life exclusively for yourself. Your BF\u2019s reaction is a red flag. IDK if it\u2019s an indication that he will end up to be overly controlling, but it\u2019s entirely possible. Just as likely is that he has some codependency issues. Stick to your guns because you are NTA.", "NTA\n\nLet's translate what happened.  Your \"partner\" effectively said to you.  I am upset that you did not offer to pay for me to go with you on your trip OR that you did not sacrifice your opportunity for me as I was unable to go as well. \n\nThat's literally what was said.

Which is, alot of what makes a (successful) relationship work is communication. Someone looking to be in a successful relationship doesn't book a trip on whim before even discussing it, even in passing, with their SO. Doesn't hurt to shoot a quick text to her SO when she sees a deal for a flight before booking. At that point she finds out he can't go, and she let's him know she will go alone this time, but they will go again together another time.
