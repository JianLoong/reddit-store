A little while ago I (29F) saw a discount flight to a nearby city. It was a 12 hour sale. I have friends in the city and immediately texted them to make plans, which they agreed. I phoned my boyfriend (31M), who I have been with about a year (we don't live together or share finances) if he wanted to come. He told me that he could not afford it right now as things were tight and he had his daughter (4F, not mine) that same weekend. So I went without him.\n\nMy boyfriend is furious with me. He said that since we have been dating for a year and are getting more serious (I've met his daughter and family, we are discussing moving in together next year) that we should make big decisions together and run weekend plans by each other. He also really wanted to visit said city another time, maybe next year. I told him I would be more than happy to visit again next year since I have many friends there. I was gone for a weekend and spent my own money to visit my own friends, so I don't see the issue. I feel like he is being controlling and I did ask him to join me, but he views me as being a bad partner who does not function as a team.\n\nSo Reddit...

If he didn\u2019t ask you then if you would stay home and do something with him and his daughter, then how were you supposed to know that\u2019s what he wanted? It sounds to me like you did run your plans by him. Him saying he doesn\u2019t want to go is not the same is saying that he\u2019d prefer you not to go.

Yikes. \n\n>*I feel like he is being controlling*\n\nYou're right, he is. Don't ignore your instincts. It would appear he doesn't like you being independent of him, and he's trying to bully you so you don't do it again. \n\nIt's not like you had plans and blew him off to do this. You had no plans, and he had his daughter that weekend. He wants you to have asked his permission and you didn't. And this hardly qualifies as a \"big decision\" as he calls it and even if it did, you don't live together and you have separate finances. \n\nHuge red flag, OP. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  I highly recommend continuing having your own interests and activities occasionally or as often as you want in this relationship.", "NTA. I took a huge trip last year spanning several countries without my partner.  He couldn\u2019t come because he didn\u2019t have the money nor the time. It was always known I wanted to travel. It\u2019s not my problem nor my sacrifice to make because he didn\u2019t plan for or prioritize travel. He envied me but he didn\u2019t resent me because he knows this.", "NTA\n\nNo one likes feeling left out, but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong at all. After his emotions calm, if he\u2019s a good guy, he\u2019ll come around.\n\nOR\n\nThis the perfect time to bring up expectations and boundaries and see if you\u2019ve got other potential points of contentions. People often subconsciously assume certain things are a \u201cgiven\u201d in a relationship and are shocked and dismayed to learn the person they\u2019re getting involved with looks at things differently.", "NTA. You two don\u2019t live together so this a major red flag.\n\nETA and this might get me downvoted. Find a man who is more financially stable. Down the road this will affect the relationship.", "NTA. I'm married, live with my husband, and share finances. If I take a weekend trip with friends and he doesn't want to/isn't able to go, he just hopes I have a great time! Your dude is being controlling.", "Nta. Though he is being controlling and manipulative. You should really sit down and talk to him about your relationship and rethink it.", "NTA. I am married and mostly travel with my husband, but if he can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t want to go for whatever reason he is more than happy with me going by myself.", "So here\u2019s a big secret (not really, but there are way too many people who don\u2019t get this), adults, no matter their relationship status, are autonomous beings. You get the final say in what you do. Certainly we all have obligations we need to meet. For instance, my wife and I frequently travel separately. I like to ski, she doesn\u2019t care for it these days. She doesn\u2019t expect me to not plan ski trip with friends. She frequently has long weekend trips with her lifelong best friend (sometimes they even go places that I\u2019d like to visit, but it\u2019s their time and I\u2019m not going to intrude on that). We also travel together as much as possible. The point is that we love and respect each other enough that WANT each other to be able to have these experiences as individuals. It is monumentally important to have a life separate from your partner. It will actually be good for your relationship if you retain some portion of your life exclusively for yourself. Your BF\u2019s reaction is a red flag. IDK if it\u2019s an indication that he will end up to be overly controlling, but it\u2019s entirely possible. Just as likely is that he has some codependency issues. Stick to your guns because you are NTA.", "NTA\n\nLet's translate what happened.  Your \"partner\" effectively said to you.  I am upset that you did not offer to pay for me to go with you on your trip OR that you did not sacrifice your opportunity for me as I was unable to go as well. \n\nThat's literally what was said. This is the backbone of gaslighting.  He is using his own inefficiency, in security, and inability to travel as a weapon against your willingness to enjoy life without him.
