A little while ago I (29F) saw a discount flight to a nearby city. It was a 12 hour sale. I have friends in the city and immediately texted them to make plans, which they agreed. I phoned my boyfriend (31M), who I have been with about a year (we don't live together or share finances) if he wanted to come. He told me that he could not afford it right now as things were tight and he had his daughter (4F, not mine) that same weekend. So I went without him.\n\nMy boyfriend is furious with me. He said that since we have been dating for a year and are getting more serious (I've met his daughter and family, we are discussing moving in together next year) that we should make big decisions together and run weekend plans by each other. He also really wanted to visit said city another time, maybe next year. I told him I would be more than happy to visit again next year since I have many friends there. I was gone for a weekend and spent my own money to visit my own friends, so I don't see the issue. I feel like he is being controlling and I did ask him to join me, but he views me as being a bad partner who does not function as a team.\n\nSo Reddit...

You get the final say in what you do. Certainly we all have obligations we need to meet. For instance, my wife and I frequently travel separately. I like to ski, she doesn\u2019t care for it these days. She doesn\u2019t expect me to not plan ski trip with friends. She frequently has long weekend trips with her lifelong best friend (sometimes they even go places that I\u2019d like to visit, but it\u2019s their time and I\u2019m not going to intrude on that). We also travel together as much as possible. The point is that we love and respect each other enough that WANT each other to be able to have these experiences as individuals. It is monumentally important to have a life separate from your partner. It will actually be good for your relationship if you retain some portion of your life exclusively for yourself. Your BF\u2019s reaction is a red flag. IDK if it\u2019s an indication that he will end up to be overly controlling, but it\u2019s entirely possible. Just as likely is that he has some codependency issues. Stick to your guns because you are NTA.", "NTA\n\nLet's translate what happened.  Your \"partner\" effectively said to you.  I am upset that you did not offer to pay for me to go with you on your trip OR that you did not sacrifice your opportunity for me as I was unable to go as well. \n\nThat's literally what was said.

It wasn't something that interested him, but he completely supported me going because I really wanted to. He goes places without me sometimes. We travel together too, don't get me wrong. That's what a healthy relationship should be, not holding someone back from doing things they like just because you can't/ don't want to (assuming affordability and family circumstances, etc.)\n\nIf your boyfriend can't find his way to reason regarding your perfect right to go visit friends without him, that's not a good indicator for what life living with him may be like.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to visit your friends without your bf. You\u2019re allowed to travel without your bf. \n\nMy partner and I have been living together for 5 years. Due to the world and some finances we havent had a chance to travel. I love to travel. He\u2019s never really left home. He knows I reallllly want to take him somewhere. But he also knows we don\u2019t really have anyone around us to watch the pets that we trust. \n\nMy partner is 100% supportive of me travelling solo if I want to. \n\nYour bf is indeed being very controlling.", "NTA He got mad at you having the freedom to visit friends.", "Absolutely NTA. Couples are perfectlly capable to go on separate fun weekends.", "You are looking into your future. Act accordingly.", "How DARE you..*checks notes*, travel somewhere without his express permission!!! He *checks notes* was BUSY and  couldn't go. So.. ehhhh *checks notes*. Yea.. he should get ANGRY rather than have a rational point. \n\nNTA. He literally has no point here. I'm married and my wife regularly just goes away with friends. The conversation is her saying \"I'm heading to Portugal with X on this weekend Y\". Me after checking calender: \"cool\" then Promptly forgetting to put it in the calender, but that's another story.", "NTA.  Weekend plans to meet up with a friend aren\u2019t a \u201cbig decision\u201d.", "NTA--  YOUR money = YOUR decision\n\nYou don't ask for permission to do anything. Seems like he just wanted you around because he wanted help with his daughter.\n\nHe is trying to guilt you....ON PURPOSE.\n\nRUN, run very far away.", "NTA he wasn't available and you don\u2019t live together, plus you can do trips alone to see your friends! I can understand being upset about not being able to go because of money but given the above, it\u2019s not that much of an issue. Plus his reaction is more than that.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. It\u2019s healthy to do things separately sometimes. You partner\u2019s reaction is concerning.", "Well, you\u2019re seeing at least one of the reasons he\u2019s not with his child\u2019s mother. I bet if you reflect, you\u2019ve seen others. This controlling behavior is not normal and you should decide if you\u2019re ready to deal with more of it. This is a start, not an anomaly.", "NTA. You should be able to take a trip to your friends on your own dime. I think your partner may have been feeling insecure or stressed about finances and was making you seem like an AH to avoid dealing with his insecurities.", "NTA. I had an ex that acted like that. Keyword had.", "NTA. I've been with my spouse the best part of two decades, our finances are thoroughly tangled, and at least once a year one of us will say \"by the way, I'm going away on X weekend to see friends\". We'll try and inform in advance, but sometimes it's pretty vague. If we might go somewhere together and then one of us can't for some reason we'll always encourage the other to do so. This is a huge red flag.", "NTA - DO NOT second guess yourself. You are not married. You found a deal. You went to visit specific friends. You invited him. You did NOTHING wrong. You do not owe him anything. He needs to grow up. Sometimes we have other responsibilities and can\u2019t do everything. That\u2019s ok. Couples don\u2019t need to spend every waking moment together. \n\nEven if you were married, there\u2019s no leg to stand on for him here. If my wife found a deal for a trip to visit a friend and it didn\u2019t impact some important financial goal we had, my response would be absolutely you go! Tell your BF to get with the program or find a more supportive partner. There are plenty of serious things to disagree about in a relationship. This is not one of them.", "Good luck with your relationship! Sounds like a keeper.", "NTA and that\u2019s a huge concern OP please be careful. \n\nUnderstand that when he says \u201crun it by him\u201d and \u201cmake big decisions together\u201d what he actually means is \u201callow him to make the decision\u201d. \n\nBecause you did run it past him. Hey I\u2019m going to x, wanna come? No, can\u2019t; so you\u2019re still going. \n\nHe\u2019s insecure that you have financial freedom and he\u2019s realized that means freedom from him in general. \n\nOnly someone with abusive tendencies would feel insecure to the point of making demands about that.", "I do feel that conversations should happen but they should go more like this - you - hey great sale to x city want to go? Him - sounds great but unfortunately I can\u2019t afford it right now and have 4 yo that weekend, have a great time, we\u2019ll miss you of course but tell us all about it when you get back. NTA of course", "I'd be like if we're supposed to be a team and run things by each other did you ask if it was okay your daughter came over this weekend..just to be petty lol", "My wife and I share finances. Even then, what right do I have to dictate what she does or does not spend her money on? Sure we talk about big things, but if she buys a plane ticket to visit her friends and tells me later, I'm happy she gets to go see her friends, not mad she didn't take me with. This dude is crazy.", "My first thought after reading this was how much do you want to bet he's freaking out at the prospect that she won't have enough money (to his liking) left over to cough up for Christmas presents for his daughter from him because money is tight?", "It feels to me like he\u2019s mad \u2018cause OP is not paying for his trip as well. He\u2019s thinking about himself, his own happiness. I think he\u2019s trying to guild trip OP into believing she has to make up for this. \n\nInstead I do hope she chooses for her own happiness. If he loved her, he would been supportive and understandable.", "Was going to say the same thing. NTA.", "It's funny how a guy wanting privacy to console a friend mourning her dog is a big red flag and hiding something while a woman leaving her bf behind and jetting to another city to spend the weekend with friends is fine. AITA do be sexist.", ">One day you can travel ~~together.~~ with your next partner.", "It would have still been N-T-A even if she didn\u2019t ask him. She\u2019s grown and using her own money. She doesn\u2019t need his permission.", "Why would she be mad? He\u2019s a full grown man, he doesn\u2019t need her permission to go to another city for the weekend. Why would it upset her that he goes off and has fun? You\u2019re projecting \n\nCouples don\u2019t need to go everywhere with each other, you do realize that?", "Furthermore\u2026 I\u2019ve been in relationships where the other person was controlling and would never have \u201clet me\u201d go away without him. There\u2019s a reason I left him in the dust and why my now partner is perfect for me.", "Probably a regular interval, i.e. every second weekend he had his daughter. But yeah, not the same in any case.", "Once you move in gaurenteed he will want to share an account and he will spend as he pleases and you'll be having to ask permission to do or buy anything.", "He low-key resents that you have financial agency when he doesn't; that's why he's trying to micromanage your funds like some kind of ghost banker.", "A plane ticket could be a big thing. It would cost me around 700 to go home. I feel like I would want to talk to my spouse before doing that. But I know he would say to do it anyways. But they aren\u2019t married, it\u2019s her money and she got a good deal. I feel like him being furious over it is sketchy.", "You are allowed to have a life outside of him. Visiting friends isn\u2019t a \u201cbig decision\u201d I would hold off on moving in together. Y\u2019all only been together a year and he has a child.", "It took a minute for me to figure out what made me so uneasy about the guy. We see controlling people posted on here all the time as well as people who are clearly the AH as OPs partner is.\n\nIt is that he is so sure he is right to be furious that sends up the red flags. You did nothing to him. You took nothing away from him. There is no real reason for him to be upset with you even if he is disappointed he couldn't go.\n\nIt seems the anger at you is because he had feelings about it and if he feels unpleasant feelings, (fomo, disappointed, jealously) those feelings are your fault and your responsibility in his head. \n\nI would go over past interactions to see if him making you responsible for how he feels is a pattern. It can be really toxic in a relationship. I would end or go more slowly with this guy.", "The whole run weekend plans by each other sounds like code for \"I need to grandfather you into babysitting without you realising it\".", "Be careful with this - I am a smart and confident person - I only found out very recently that my wife had questioned herself because of my confidence - not in fights necessarily but on anything we may disagree on - thing is she is just as smart - and more - than I am - and I feel awful knowing that she thought her views were less than mine because of this dynamic. Its work for both of us to do - but seeing you write this made me think of her - and \u2026 I dunno - I guess I wanted to share that experience - take it for what it\u2019s worth. Confidence isn\u2019t the same as being right.", "Don\u2019t confuse confidence with validity. Some people are often wrong but never in doubt. Especially those people with abusive or controlling behaviors", "Yeah definetly NTA- I have been with my now husband 8 years, I have his kid - and I still am able to say 'hey I think i'm going away for the weekend next month' and his reply is 'yeah, have fun' - even then the only issue is childcare because it's my kid-but most of the time he double checks his calendar and says 'no problem'  you havn't got that issue so this really is just your boyfriend being controlling.", "That's what he wants.He is Gaslighting you and if you keep yourself in this relationship soon you will be second guessing your every breathe", "Take care of yourself, OP.  This isn\u2019t good and it isn\u2019t a healthy relationship dynamic to have.\n\nI go visit my friends in Chicago a few times a year.  Some of the stuff we do doesn\u2019t interest my partner at all so depending on our specific plans, he doesn\u2019t always come with me.  And sometimes he straight up just can\u2019t and that\u2019s okay as well.  He\u2019s never upset that I want to go see them instead of hanging with him.\n\nWe both want the other person to have friends and nurture relationships outside of one another - both as a couple and individually.", "Don't hurt your back with that reach!", "Telling his wife to eff off and leave him to hug a 'friend' in a bedroom alone is vastly different to a person that lives alone but is currently in a relationship making plans for the weekend that doesn't include the partner who had a previous commitment.\n\nGender is irrelevant.", "If you share a household and finances, it\u2019s a little different. My husband asked me and we had a chat before taking a weekend trip with his friends because we were both taking classes and had spent a sizable sum on fixing the floors in our house. We decided he rarely gets to see them and wouldn\u2019t be able to see them again for awhile and it was worth the expense to have the memories.  The older you get and the more responsibilities you have, the harder it is to do those things.", "The last part you mention, about OP\u2019s bf expecting childcare from her? Spot on. How dare she have fun on her own, with her own money, while he has to care for the child he created. /s\n\nBut really, all of these top comments are it. OP, I\u2019ve been here and wish I left sooner. It won\u2019t get better. And I second not telling him that you\u2019re seeing red flags or that other people have pointed out red flags to you. Most likely he will only deflect and turn it around on you.", "Or rescheduling AND paying for him to go.", "Exactly. My husband and I have been married for more than 20 years and I go on trips without him at least 2-3 times a year. Sometimes he\u2019s not interested in going and others he can\u2019t get away. It doesn\u2019t impact our relationship at all.", "there's even a special sub for it. r/confidentlyincorrect", "Not gaslighting, but definitely manipulative.", "A guy was an asshole for wanting to be alone with a friend whose dog died. A woman spends a weekend alone with her friends and the guy is an asshole for not wanting her to. What \"reach\" are you talking about?", "He didn't tell his wife to eff off until she made it very clear he was not allowed privacy in his own house. And yes, he hugged a woman. Oh no, how horrible, must be super sexual.", "Except OP said they don\u2019t live together or share finances.", "Just make sure it's locked or somewhere he can't find it.  I get the feeling that if he was furious about the trip, he would be even more dangerous if he found something like that.\n\nEdit: removed a word that made no grammatical sense", "This ^ My ex would gas light me constantly, once I started keeping journal entries of our fights it all became crystal clear.", "I don't think I've ever used the windows key in my life until now. \ud83d\udea9", "Well, I called that woman an AH, so\u2026\u2026..?", "The only comment I agree with you on.", "If you read my comments you would see I said that and that\u2019s she\u2019s NTA. I said it would be different if they did, but they don\u2019t and the fact he was angry makes it weird.", "Wait, what... the Windows key has a *function*????", "That's why my post refers to AITA and not strictly your comment.", "Even if she upped and left after he said he couldn't go it still wouldn't make her the asshole.   \nBesides, she already informed him she was going. Why does she have to inform him yet again? Him not being able to go is irrelvant. It was pretty obvious she was going regardless."]}
