They were always incredibly concerned with what other people/kids would think... MIL would constantly say \"You don't want to be made fun of, do you???\" and both parents put a lot of pressure to fit in and not be \"weird\"... they said it was for the kids' benefit.\n\nTurns out, it was the parents projecting their insecurities onto their kid. MIL is a life-long people pleaser and is incredibly worried about what people think of her, so she transfers that anxiety everywhere. FIL is very self-image focused and was concerned what people would think of HIM if they saw his kid acting weird. \n\nOnce my partner was able to get out of that house they flourished finally able to be themselves.
