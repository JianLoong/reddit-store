I helped him pack \ud83d\ude0f", "Save us from the kind respectful people, and all the red flags they carry around! /s\n\nDude was nuts, OP obviously encountered troublesome behavior and has acted appropriately.  \n\nBut her saying she met a nice guy isn't \"by itself... a red flag\"  she didn't call him a \"nice guy\", she said he was a nice guy.\n\nPlease let's stop with the triggered reading into terminology based on internet fads.  A dude being nice is not a red flag...", "Happy cake day!", "Is it really \"consensual\" when someone simply leaves their laundry behind for their partner to do? Or slowly moves in their stuff without prior conversation so that they're harder to move out? \n\nNone of this appears to have been done with her enthusiastic approval, so it seems very non-consensual to me.", "Mmm. 38m assuming he\u2019ll move in. Don\u2019t mean to pre-judge but the picture paints itself. Yep, you dont want that.", "But why were you doing his laundry??", "whoopee. so the bare minimum. No, not even.", "also there's a difference between a man calling himself a nice guy and a woman saying a man is a nice guy. the first one is a red flag. the second is a judge of character", "I get what you meant! What I mean is when the person gets caught on the narrative \u201cbut he\u2019s a nice guy\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe has problems *but* he\u2019s a nice guy\u201d\n\nI see though I misread. I thought OP was calling him a nice guy but I see what was said was \u201che seemed a nice guy\u201d.", "Op you did well. If he actually wanted a real relationship, he would take the time to get to know you as a person.\n\nNot try and go from 0 to 100 in a few weeks of dating.\n\nTrust me, I know from personal experience.  When things are going well in the beginning, you want to think you found someone you can stand still with for a while. Especially after a long hiatus. But you need time to get to know one another and let the glasses fall off.\n\n\nThere will be other fun to be had. Take your time, and you will definitely find the right person to move forward with. \n\nNta in the slightest.", "NTA If you haven't already, you need to pack her things and move them to her apartment.", "It\u2019s less generous when the coffee he was making her was her damn coffee.", "He was here all the time so he put his clothes in the laundry basket with mine.  Oh, and I have to use the laundromat in the building, so I had to pay for the machines to do the laundry.", "Absolutely.  The person I responded to is fixated on the first \n\n>a man calling himself a nice guy", "lol, yup, my coffee", "Dear god, toss this whole man", "Nooooo. I\u2019m honestly glad you\u2019ve posted on here so that you can see from all these comments how not okay your situation is.", "exactly and it doesn't seem like this guy did that in the first place", "I'm glad I did to.  I honestly didn't see this for what it really is."]}
