But then I had to get back to reality and wanted to take things easy and see where things go.  But now he is leaving his stuff at my home, my laundry loads have doubled.  He does little chores around the apartment but I think it is time for him to go home now.  He has roommates so there is more privacy for him here, but I\u2019m used to being solo and this is feeling more like an invasion of my space.

He wants to move in and asked how much is my rent.  I told him it doesn\u2019t matter, he isn\u2019t moving in.  He says he is happy with me and wants us to be in a full relationship.

Good for you for setting and keeping boundaries. Asking for a key that fast is kind of a red flag though, so be careful if you continue the relationship", "Only 2 months in?    He doesn't need a key.  \n\nNta.", "NTA.  Two months and he wants to move in?  I think, however, that he took your lack of boundaries at the beginning as a sign that he could walk all over you.  You're going to have to get a spine--and quickly-- or this is only going to get worse.\n\nThe good news is that two months is barely even a relationship and he was nice enough to throw around enough warnings for you to sit up and take notice.", "You\u2019ve probably dodged a bullet here. What\u2019s not to like about free sex and maid services combined? You are being used. Expect love-bombing when he realizes his silent treatment isn\u2019t working.

If he breaks up with you at this point, as much as it may be upsetting because he's fun, I suspect it will also be a relief.\n\nTwo months would be way too early for him to have a key to your home even if he HADN'T de facto moved himself in without your enthusiastic consent and encouragement. But given that he has basically encroached on your space to the point where you're realising that you feel smothered already and are having to not-so-gently ask him for breathing room, it sounds like it isn't even that fun anymore.\n\nYou are very much NTA, and honestly, I think you did great with your answers, particularly the \"you have to give me a chance to miss you\". You weren't obnoxious, but you were pointed, and he's not going to hear anything less than that because he's actively trying not to listen. In fact, it sounds like he may not hear that. Good luck to you, and hold fast to those boundaries. Two months in, you are 100% correct that you can - and SHOULD - have a wonderful, newly developing, meaningful relationship whilst living in entirely different households.", "I would see this as a flag!

Block his number and enjoy your life.", "NTA.\n\nIt's clear that you entered into this relationship with the intention of taking things slow and seeing where they go. It's completely understandable that you feel overwhelmed and invaded by his constant presence in your space. It's important for both individuals in a relationship to have their own personal time and space.\n\nYou communicated your boundaries clearly when you explained why he couldn't have a key and expressed your desire to continue the relationship while living separately. It's reasonable to want to maintain your independence and not rush into living together so soon.\n\nHis reaction of getting angry and not answering your calls is an overreaction and shows a lack of respect for your boundaries and feelings.", "Hunny I think you just got dumped.", "ESH.
