She needs therapy, badly, and while you can't force her to do that, trying to force it is not the answer. Your heart is in the right place, but it might be better to approach her about therapy first.", "Technically, YWNBTA for asking her not to bring the doll, but only technically. It's your home, and as the host, you hav the right to ask. But it's a bad idea. I'd wager that it's more likely that your sister wouldn't come to Easter at all rather than leave the doll at home.\n\nIf you want to get your sister to focus more in the family, you'd do better to have a babysitter for the doll (yes, someone to watch the doll for her), though depending on where she is, she may not be okay with that (or may only be OK with it for a few hours).\n\nWhile I get it makes you uncomfortable, it sounds like a much more healthy coping mechanism that risk seeking, drugs, alcohol, and myriad other methods that people who are grieving great personal loss might turn to. Have you spoken to a professional (psychologist, therapist, gried counselor, etc.) about how best to approach the situation?", "I feel like you need to approach her and express your worries and ask how you can help, rather than just tell her she\u2019s not allowed the only thing that\u2019s helping her cope. Maybe sit down with her and tell her that you love her and are worried, and that you\u2019d love to hear more about her actual baby and how she is doing. Maybe get her a sentimental piece of jewelry or something similar with the baby\u2019s birth stone, or a blanket with baby\u2019s name that she can keep on her bed? It\u2019s known that tangible items can help with grieving, she just happened to choose an item that makes some people uncomfortable.", "NAH, though it a very shitty situation for everyone to be in. It is very clear that your sister is suffering very much from her recent loss of her child and the ending of her marriage. Your sister is indeed coping, and it isn't healthy unless she is actively in therapy, and there is a plan to help her move past the doll being a substitute for her lost child. \n\nSpeaking of that, you could also be dealing with the grief, and you choose to accept it and want to force her to, but we all have our own paths through grief and trauma. I don't think this is the correct subreddit to really look for answers, and it might be best to let her be, but I would suggest if your sister isn't in therapy you may want to consult a grief counselor or therapist on how best to navigate your sister through moving past the doll. I can see very real and serious concerns here.", "Just ask her if the doll has any food allergies and get on with the day. Leave her alone.", "This is way above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. I\u2019m not sure any of us can judge how to help wean your sister off her doll (you included).\nI would not try to separate her from the doll or make her feel judged for needing it. The more supported and loved she feels the better. \nUnfortunately I do think you\u2019d be TA, but I hope you find some professional guidance on how to support her.", "YWBTA The doll probably isn't a healthy coping mechanism but what do you think you'll accomplish with this? She'll show up without the doll and suddenly realize she doesn't need it and her grief will be healed?  I don't think so.  What will happen is you'll create a lot of drama and angst and she'll still be struggling. I'm not sure how to help her but making her leave her doll home for a family dinner isn't it.", "I'm a bit surprised at some of the vitriol in the comment section. NAH.\n\nYour sister is traumatized, the doll is a coping mechanism, albeit an unhealthy and ultimately unhelpful one. Your sister isn't an asshole for using a psychological crutch; it may be the only thing keeping her going right now.\n\nYou aren't an asshole for not wanting to have to humour that crutch, especially when it's interfering with your sister's ability to interact with people, as well as confront & process her own grief.\n\nYour sister desperately needs therapy (which I'm certain you already know). The doll is stunting her grieving process; as long as she treats the doll as a real baby, she doesn't have to figure out how to live life now that it has a massive hole in it. This dependence will get more entrenched the longer it goes on, and complicated grief will put more strain on her the longer it goes untreated (speaking from experience here, nearly killed me lol).\n\nI'd let her bring the doll, and I wouldn't make mention of it during the get-together. But I'd also talk with other family members pretty soon about trying to nudge her towards getting into therapy, which I assume she isn't in yet.\n\nGrief looks different for everyone, and it isn't a steady, predictable process. But this type of grief transference gets more unhealthy the longer it goes on. There's no 'recovery' from losing a child; she will always be grieving that loss. But the doll is a blockade, and it will keep her mentally and emotionally stationary in that place and unable to move forward for as long as she keeps treating it like a real infant.\n\nNo assholes here; just the fallout of a terrible situation. Encourage her to research therapists near her--or grief groups. Do some research of your own to help her out if she's resistant to the idea. If you're in a city, most in North America will have resources for grieving parents; hospitals, therapy offices, and Planned Parenthood should all have info for you.", "NAH, but what is most alarming is that she truly believes it's real. That's a very scary delusion that if left unchecked can develop into something much worse. This isn't about Easter dinner, she really really needs therapy, and I know you said she declined, so I would talk to a professional and see what they suggest. For the time being though,  maybe just let her bring it.", "Not an expert, but I wonder if your sister needs inpatient therapy given her apparent detachment from reality.", "YTA- she's not hurting anyone by doing this. It's odd from an outside perspective sure, but thankfully I have no idea what it's like to lose a child. She could probably benefit from some therapy if she hasn't gone down that road already, but ultimately I think if you want her to come, don't make this an issue. Set up a pack and play and maybe the baby will nap most of the time. Only kind of kidding on that. Gets the doll out of the room during the meal and she's not being asked to chose between family and whats she's associated as her child.", "NTA. Tell her to get therapy. Nothing wrong with refusing to participate in another's delusions.", "Your sister needs help. Barring her from family gatherings (which is effectively what this would do) is only likely to make things worse since she'll end up more isolated with the doll. I don't know what the best move forward here is, but I suggest you discuss it with your own therapist (you can't force her to get help, but you could get professional support in trying to help your sister) before making a move like this.", "YTA. Has she gotten professional help? If not, maybe help her see someone and don't take away the one thing she has to deal with trauma. I mean, unless you want your dinner to go from bad to worse.", "YWBTA \n\nRealistically if you ask that she\u2019s not going to come and you know it.", "YWBTA. I would not ask her to leave the doll at home until she has been seeing a therapist to learn alternate coping techniques. Just invite her and ignore the doll. At some point try to have a conversation with her about it. Don\u2019t use \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d or \u201cthis is creepy\u201d language. Tell her you are concerned about her and suggest therapy.", "YWBTA.\n\nI agree that it\u2019s creepy and unhealthy, but it sounds like this is the only thing holding her together right now.\n\nIt might be time for a family conversation about the benefits of therapy, not aimed just at her but more about how everyone can benefit from have an impartial person to talk things through with.", "Stop being an asshole and get her the correct therapy so she can let go of the doll in a healthy manner, instead of taking something of sentimental value and replacing it with nothing", "YWBTA\n\nI don\u2019t know what the answer is but this isn\u2019t it.", "YWBTA for sure.  She isn\u2019t hurting anyone by bringing the doll.  But, you could cause her a lot of harm if you ask her not to bring it or shun her.  She is still grieving.  She needs therapy, but she doesn\u2019t need your judgement.  You have no idea what that poor woman is going thorough.  Everyone handles grief differently.  Have some grace.", "YTA- people grieve differently and it\u2019s not hurting anybody", "NAH. You'll have to accept that the doll is now part of her existence. I think forcing or issuing ultimatums will end poorly. She's not in her right mind, but will only get help when she's ready to accept it. Just be as supportive as you can, even if it is weird AF.", "YWBTA yes it sounds unhealthy but your sister will hear \u201cleave the baby at home \u201c\nIf you want to see your sister you have to accept she needs to bring the doll.\nI don\u2019t know the answer for making her get therapy when she\u2019s not harming herself (physically) or at risk of harming others.\nIs she single?", "Im not sure. Is she seeing a therapist who agrees it's still helpful? Because it certainly doesnt sound like shes coping well, though there isn't really a \"correct way\" to cope, but i just dont think this is it, this long after it happened\n\nI have a reborn because 1) i have always liked dolls and still do, 2) dressing him up in cute clothes helps me deal with baby fever, and 3) holding a baby has actually been proven to help with anxiety. I certainly don't think he's real though, and I don't play feed him (anymore, lolll), unless i was filming a YT video or something.\n\ni'd say yes, YWBTA, but at the same time, try your best (in whatever roll you have in her life) to help her work through her grief in a possibly healthier way.\n\nBut then again, maybe stripping her of the doll (not necessarily forever) might act like a wake up call for her? But, personally, i  would probably do the previous.", "YWBTA. I agree, it doesn't sound like the healthiest coping mechanism, but it's what she has right now, and telling her not to bring the doll will only result in your sister not coming to Easter at all. I'd worry that you'd inadvertently create distance between your sister and the *healthy* support of your family, and she might end up becoming more dependent on the doll as a result.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As long as it\u2019s not said in a mocking sort of way. If it\u2019s said right \u2014 that is: with care, compassion, and sensitivity \u2014 perhaps OP\u2019s sister will see that while other\u2019s may not understand her grief, they\u2019re still there to support her no matter what. \n\nThis is the only way the sister knows how to handle her grief. She likely feels alone in her grief and like no one understands and that she\u2019s going through the motions alone. OP already said they don\u2019t bring up the doll due to the sensitive nature. However, I would wager that their silence regarding the doll is actually sending a very loud message to the sister. She knows that the lack of acknowledgment is actually just carefully disguised judgment. She also knows that their reaction would be totally different if it were the real child [that she lost] instead of the doll\u2026which just compounds the situation even more because she already feels lost, perhaps like a failure even (to be clear: she\u2019s not at all, but we\u2019re sometimes our own worst critics) due to losing the child, as well as the demise of her marriage, and now the idea that she maybe feels like she failed her family (she didn\u2019t!) because she knows their complete silence and lack of acknowledgment towards the doll would not be so if the doll were actually the child. So she\u2019s probably feeling like she let everyone down. \n\nI can understand how the OP thinks it\u2019s best to just stay mum whenever the doll is mentioned or present, but it\u2019s actually isolating the sister even more, since the silence is really just judgment. This is only leading the sister to feeling more alone and falling deeper into her coping strategy. \n\nSometimes when we\u2019re in the thick of it, we just need to feel validated and like we\u2019re not crazy in order to feel less alone. And when it\u2019s others we care about who are going through a tough time that we don\u2019t necessarily understand, sometimes we just need to go along with the whacky things that we maybe also don\u2019t understand in order to make them feel validated and less alone. \n\nThe sister\u2019s coping strategy is not harming anyone here as it stands now, but being pushed further into isolation may eventually lead to that. So being less judgmental and more supportive could do wonders here.", "You are NOT supposed to show the reborn doll to your family and ask them to treat it as it's real. You are supposed to take care of the doll in private to help cope with what could of been but acknowledge that it's not real. The reborn doll has been shown to help with grief when used properly, this specific subreddit has a few posts precisely about people misusing the doll.\n\nOne in particular is where a woman threatens her extremely young nephew to treat the real doll as if it's his cousin, this is NOT a proper use for the reborn doll. \n\nAny OTHER use is harmful. The sister is an asshole because you are given many, many warnings about the proper use for these kinds of dolls and forcing family to interact with it is extremely cruel.", "I like this option, even if it's a joke. Ideally I don't want to feed into this but I understand that banning the doll wouldn't be the answer. \n\nThanks for your input.", "This is actually, as \u201ckind of\u201d kidding as you are, quite a good solution. Even if this is a ridiculous coping mechanism or seemingly unhealthy it\u2019s the one that\u2019s currently working for her in her situation right now.

Therapy was the only thing to help me get through the experience of almost losing my child, so I can't imagine how much more difficult it is for your sister. You are only coming from a place of love and concern for her. I think most people get that. But if the doll is her coping mechanism and she hasn't yet had any therapy, I think she's going to need therapy to learn to live without it.

But your sister is in an extremely difficult moment in her life she lost a baby and her husband left her, while I understand that the doll is not a perfect coping mechanism.\n\nBanning the doll won't help your sister and might even push her away to the deep end. \n\nMy suggestion is if you care about her is try looking for grief counselors or therapist who specialise at child loss or something similar and tell her that you love her ,care about her and when she is ready you can give her the contacts of the counselors. \n\nLet your sister live the life she could've had for now, don't be an AH especially on Easter.\n\nI hope you're sister feels better soon", "NAH, but your sister needs professional help, and quickly.

Should you bring up the children she lost?  Should you have a small memorial basket at Easter for that child?  A moment of silence before the meal?  a simple prayer?  \n\nIMO, your sister is massively struggling and I think you have a responsibility to gently nudge her to talk about her real child in hopes that it will allow her to process her grief.  I would not restrict the doll.  I would talk about the doll and the deceased baby.  I hope your sister gets better.\n\nNo judgement because I think your just trying to figure out how to do the right thing and aren\u2019t sure what that is.", "NAH, but she needs grief councilling. This route helps in the short term, but isn't health in the long term", "NAH. \n\nYou are in a very difficult situation here. As you said, your sister has gone through two massive upheavals in her life at around the same time. Just one of those would devastate even the strongest of people, so two at once has broken her in ways that most of us can\u2019t comprehend.  \n\nTo the majority of rational people, these re-born dolls are creepy. Sadly, at the moment, your sister is far from rational. I would lay odds that she is feeling an immense amount of guilt. Sadly, guilt is a familiar emotion for people to feel when they lose a child. Add on to this that she will, I believe, think that it\u2019s her fault her husband left\u2026\u2026.I\u2019m not surprised that she is acting irrationally. This doll has become her coping mechanism, her crutch. Is that healthy?  Yes and no. Yes, because she needs something to focus on, something to care for in place of the baby and husband she lost. At the moment, this doll is providing her a comfort that nothing else (in her mind) can bring. \n\nHaving said that, the notion that she believes the doll is real is worrying. If something were to happen to the doll, it was taken away, it broke, it got lost etc, the likelihood is that this would be yet another emotional crisis that her poor brain couldn\u2019t handle. \n\nIf I were in your shoes I would keep quiet about the negative side of the doll. At the moment she needs it. Her brain is healing and eventually I hope, for her sake, that she will be able to let go of her crutch. We know that therapy will help but she is going through so much that the stress of therapy (and it is stressful) may be too much. Be gentle with her, make sure that other family members know not to be confrontational with her or mock her. I would suggest a family meeting with everyone except your sister to make sure you\u2019re all on the same page. She needs gentle support, love and, in time and with healing, encouragement to talk to a professional about her losses. In the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s just a doll, but to her, right now, it\u2019s everything. \n\nGood luck.", "That\u2019s really sad but she needs help you can\u2019t give her.

Denial has always been a coping mechanism to protect someone until ready to affront that problem. And not only in grief. \nWhat is risky here is the there is not supervision of a therapist or even a psychiatrist and the bond with the doll could become unhealthy and not help the patient in the long run. Treating the doll like a real thing to make ease on the loss and believing she is real are of course two very different things. And a professional supervision is something should be done. That said not everybody is ready to ask for help and sometime if someone is not ready help can not be given. \nEdit: also using subreddit as what should and should\u2019t be done on medical, psychiatrical field are like comparing YouTube video to a medical visit.

Which there's nothing wrong with that, when you have your own life and your own kids you have to focus on that. You have to focus on your priorities over someone else's. But, you cannot claim that someone is just as important to you as your own priorities, if your actions do not match it. Especially in a tough tricky delicate situation like this.\nThere is nothing wrong with prioritizing yourself and your family first, but you cannot claim to have the same level of dedication and care to someone else if you are not showing those actions.

Sorry for no real help and good luck!", "NAH\n\nHave you seen the film *Lars and the Real Girl?* Might be worth a look, as it is about a very similar situation to yours.\n\nAt any rate, I would highly suggest therapy. That is likely the only way that any progress would be made here.", "NAH\n\nBut I don't think a major family holiday gathering is the time to intervene. I would not make Easter the \"Hill\". I'd meet with a professional and set up a plan that doesn't do more harm. Your sister is obviously suffering and needs you more than ever just make sure you are keeping her as the priority and not just your own discomfort with the tools she's using to cope with her trauma.", "I have a relative with a doll (she has dementia). For the short term, I would recommend a fictional babysitter for the doll, so she can enjoy your party. But in general, you're going to need to help your sister get therapy. She doesn't have dementia, she shouldn't think the doll is actually real. That should be a major concern for her loved ones, especially if she is currently living alone. I personally think she should move in with a relative or go to a reputable inpatient psych ward. This isn't normal behavior, and I'm not a doctor, but I assume this will only get worse the longer it's left unaddressed. \n\nFor the short term: With my grandma's doll we use a fictional babysitter to make her feel at ease when she's without the doll. Maybe that will help get your sister some time away from the doll. \n\nNAH But please get your sister medical help <3 I hope things work out.", "It is absolutely mind blowing to me that your sister is in the throes of a grief-induced mental health crisis, and your biggest concern is the aesthetic of the lovely Easter lunch you\u2019re trying to host. Do you even hear yourself? \n\nYes, YWBTA here for so many reasons, but your sister bringing her doll isn\u2019t one of them.", "This is much more than her not bring the doll. \n\nNAH", "This reminds me of the movie Lars and the Real Girl. Such a good movie and you should absolutely watch it! Ryan Gosling is dealing with grief and buys a sex doll and thinks it\u2019s his girlfriend. The whole town comes along and befriends the girlfriend. Very heartwarming\u2764\ufe0f\n\nThis is a sad situation and I completely understand you not wanting her to bring the doll but I think you might alienate your sister if you ask. Love her as best you can and remember that peoples actions/behaviors reflects on them not in you. \n\nNAH good luck!!", "NTA but it might be a time for an intervention.  She\u2019s had two major tragedies back to back so maybe encouraging her to have your parents \u201cbabysit\u201d while you take her out and remind her who she was before the baby will help. Having fun without the kids is a part of being a parent and this seems to be how she\u2019s identifying herself.  You might be able to use that to gently pry it away from her. \ud83c\udf3cGood luck!", "YWBTA simply because this isn\u2019t going to go how you want it too, so you\u2019d be pointlessly forcing her hand. You have to understand, she actually views that doll as her baby, so in her eyes you are not only asking for her to leave her \u201cbaby\u201d behind which no one would normally do, but by doing so you\u2019d be forcing herself to face the reality of her grief and shatter the \u201csafe\u201d alternative reality she\u2019s built. That\u2019s not going to end well for anyone, Easter would be a disaster if she does this.\n\nShe needs therapy. She might seem happier right now, but she\u2019s living on egg shells. I\u2019m not sure if you can convince her to go to therapy though, since that will also force her to face her grief. And if she won\u2019t go, there\u2019s not much you can do. Either accept that she\u2019s grieving so badly that she\u2019s basically mentally ill and the doll is her support dog equivalent, or exclude her. But either way I would try to engage in some gentle talks and encourage her to go to therapy.", "Get a sitter?", "Prayers for sister, you, and family in your rough situation. Sometimes the only thing we can do is hold each other while we hurt. At an appropriate time and place it could be healing if you shared your own feelings of grief over your nibling, and your heartache for your sister, with your sister.", "I am so sorry for your sister and your family. I hope your sister will get therapy so she can heal from her pain. Please accept hug from internet stranger. Best wishes for you and your family.", "I wonder if you could have a trusted friend offer to \"babysit.\" If your sister feels the doll is being taken care of, maybe she'll attend without it. Of course, this won't solve the underlying issue, but it could get her to your home for Easter without the doll.", "OP, there is no easy answer to this and it\u2019s definitely not situation we should be passing judgement on. Even if your sister isn\u2019t ready for therapy, you can get therapy as a family member trying to support another. She doesn\u2019t have to be involved but may come around to it. \n\nEither way, your feelings are valid, so are hers. I wish you and your family all the best.", "So does the doll get a high chair at the Easter dinner table? This is creepy AF and I can\u2019t imagine how this helps anyone. As you say, it\u2019s her life, but it\u2019s YOUR house. NTA", "Whoever organized it told her, if not using that word at any rate.  I wouldve been more surprised if she had shown up", "NAH\n\nI would suggest that you talk to her and ask what she would like to do. \n\nShe is misusing the doll - and you could bring literature to this effect - but tell her you accept that she needs to do what she needs to at the moment. \n\nHowever, tell her that her treatment of it makes others uncomfortable. Tell her the doll is welcome in your home BUT NOT at the table. Would she like to bring pyjamas etc for the doll to sleep in another room while you are eating at the table, etc.", "Sounds to me as if she's already had that mental break, tbh. The woman clearly needs help. Not \"see a therapist once a week\" help, but actual inpatient hospital stay help. It sounds way beyond a coping mechanism and a lot more like delusion. NAH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I saw one that a lady had commissioned to look exactly like her dead baby AFTER he had died. The doll was literally gray-blue with glazed over eyes. Horrifying.\n\nThat's ... something else for sure. What a terrible day to be literate. Those dolls are creepy at the best of times!", "It took me two years and two more miscarriages after my first miscarriage and my stillbirth to seek therapy. People aren't assholes for needing time to process on their own before getting a professional to support them.", "There is a very interesting movie on this subject, grief and recovery, called Real Doll. You go into the movie with one belief paradigm and leave doing a 180\u00b0 turn. \n\nI highly recommend it for those coping with family/friends muddling their way through grief in what may seem to be unhealthy mechanisms.", "It may be time for a stronger approach. \n\nIt sounds like she is not dealing with her grief and actively avoiding reality.\n\nShe sounds like she needs professional help, even if she doesn't want it right now.", "> What a terrible day to be literate.\n\n\ud83d\ude02 this was a really funny way to start my day.", "You make such a good point. The doll isn't hurting anyone but the grief is.  I hope the family can help her sister in a more productive way. I'm glad things are going better for you.", " I just want to give you a long, long hug. I am so sorry that happened. It\u2019s unimaginable.", "The fact that there are so many warnings about this suggests it's relatively common to \"minuse\" the doll. Saying \"misuse\" also absolves the company of any responsibility for this. It seems pretty clear that they are taking advantage of some of the worst grief imaginable and then blaming people who are clearly mentally unwell for their resulting behaviour.", "Until season 3/4 where it just gets bonkers though I still love it", "If you want to get your sister to focus more in the family, you'd do better to have a babysitter for the doll yes.", "She is still an adult. Unless she is actively a danger to herself or others, there isn\u2019t that many direct options you can take as a family. And an ultimatum will likely only drive her further away from the family.", "This isn\u2019t psychosis. It\u2019s a coping mechanism that\u2019s gone too far because the root issues haven\u2019t been addressed.", "Thank you, I really appreciate that. I truly do. It was, by far, the worst times of my life. I don't think OP realizes how difficult it is to lose a child. Nor would I wish them to ever experience that grief. I hope she lets her sister bring the doll, offers lots of love and support, and gives her an outlet for her sorrow, as well as hopefully helps her find a good therapist.", "I'm halfway season three hehe. Every time you think it can't possibly get weirder.. well, it gets weirder.", "If it helps you at all, I used to show up to my therapist about 30 minutes early and write a quick list of topics I wanted to talk about. I'd hand it to my therapist and we'd go off of that for the day. I usually limited it to 3-4 points, as I only had an hour at a time.", "It\u2019s a delusion. You don\u2019t fight the delusion, you meet them where they are at without judgement, just curiosity. This is done in therapy, not in a family intervention.", "They can but I think it\u2019s important to have a professional mediate the intervention. I\u2019ve participated in three, and the two that were successful had an outside source directing things. The one that kinda blew up was led by someone\u2019s mom who Googled how to do an intervention.", "People validate delusional people all the time nowadays. Ever been on TikTok?", "Wait did you all tell her it was an intervention in the invite? No one's gonna willingly go to their own intervention lol"]}
