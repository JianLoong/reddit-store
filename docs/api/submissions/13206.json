She needs therapy, badly, and while you can't force her to do that, trying to force it is not the answer. Your heart is in the right place, but it might be better to approach her about therapy first.", "Technically, YWNBTA for asking her not to bring the doll, but only technically. It's your home, and as the host, you hav the right to ask. But it's a bad idea. I'd wager that it's more likely that your sister wouldn't come to Easter at all rather than leave the doll at home.\n\nIf you want to get your sister to focus more in the family, you'd do better to have a babysitter for the doll (yes, someone to watch the doll for her), though depending on where she is, she may not be okay with that (or may only be OK with it for a few hours).\n\nWhile I get it makes you uncomfortable, it sounds like a much more healthy coping mechanism that risk seeking, drugs, alcohol, and myriad other methods that people who are grieving great personal loss might turn to. Have you spoken to a professional (psychologist, therapist, gried counselor, etc.) about how best to approach the situation?", "I feel like you need to approach her and express your worries and ask how you can help, rather than just tell her she\u2019s not allowed the only thing that\u2019s helping her cope. Maybe sit down with her and tell her that you love her and are worried, and that you\u2019d love to hear more about her actual baby and how she is doing. Maybe get her a sentimental piece of jewelry or something similar with the baby\u2019s birth stone, or a blanket with baby\u2019s name that she can keep on her bed? It\u2019s known that tangible items can help with grieving, she just happened to choose an item that makes some people uncomfortable.", "NAH, though it a very shitty situation for everyone to be in. It is very clear that your sister is suffering very much from her recent loss of her child and the ending of her marriage. Your sister is indeed coping, and it isn't healthy unless she is actively in therapy, and there is a plan to help her move past the doll being a substitute for her lost child. \n\nSpeaking of that, you could also be dealing with the grief, and you choose to accept it and want to force her to, but we all have our own paths through grief and trauma. I don't think this is the correct subreddit to really look for answers, and it might be best to let her be, but I would suggest if your sister isn't in therapy you may want to consult a grief counselor or therapist on how best to navigate your sister through moving past the doll. I can see very real and serious concerns here.", "Just ask her if the doll has any food allergies and get on with the day. Leave her alone.", "This is way above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. I\u2019m not sure any of us can judge how to help wean your sister off her doll (you included).\nI would not try to separate her from the doll or make her feel judged for needing it. The more supported and loved she feels the better. \nUnfortunately I do think you\u2019d be TA, but I hope you find some professional guidance on how to support her.", "YWBTA The doll probably isn't a healthy coping mechanism but what do you think you'll accomplish with this? She'll show up without the doll and suddenly realize she doesn't need it and her grief will be healed?  I don't think so.  What will happen is you'll create a lot of drama and angst and she'll still be struggling. I'm not sure how to help her but making her leave her doll home for a family dinner isn't it.", "I'm a bit surprised at some of the vitriol in the comment section. NAH.\n\nYour sister is traumatized, the doll is a coping mechanism, albeit an unhealthy and ultimately unhelpful one. Your sister isn't an asshole for using a psychological crutch; it may be the only thing keeping her going right now.\n\nYou aren't an asshole for not wanting to have to humour that crutch, especially when it's interfering with your sister's ability to interact with people, as well as confront & process her own grief.\n\nYour sister desperately needs therapy (which I'm certain you already know). The doll is stunting her grieving process; as long as she treats the doll as a real baby, she doesn't have to figure out how to live life now that it has a massive hole in it. This dependence will get more entrenched the longer it goes on, and complicated grief will put more strain on her the longer it goes untreated (speaking from experience here, nearly killed me lol).\n\nI'd let her bring the doll, and I wouldn't make mention of it during the get-together. But I'd also talk with other family members pretty soon about trying to nudge her towards getting into therapy, which I assume she isn't in yet.\n\nGrief looks different for everyone, and it isn't a steady, predictable process. But this type of grief transference gets more unhealthy the longer it goes on. There's no 'recovery' from losing a child; she will always be grieving that loss. But the doll is a blockade, and it will keep her mentally and emotionally stationary in that place and unable to move forward for as long as she keeps treating it like a real infant.\n\nNo assholes here; just the fallout of a terrible situation. Encourage her to research therapists near her--or grief groups. Do some research of your own to help her out if she's resistant to the idea. If you're in a city, most in North America will have resources for grieving parents; hospitals, therapy offices, and Planned Parenthood should all have info for you.", "NAH, but what is most alarming is that she truly believes it's real. That's a very scary delusion that if left unchecked can develop into something much worse. This isn't about Easter dinner, she really really needs therapy, and I know you said she declined, so I would talk to a professional and see what they suggest. For the time being though,  maybe just let her bring it.", "Not an expert, but I wonder if your sister needs inpatient therapy given her apparent detachment from reality.", "YTA- she's not hurting anyone by doing this. It's odd from an outside perspective sure, but thankfully I have no idea what it's like to lose a child. She could probably benefit from some therapy if she hasn't gone down that road already, but ultimately I think if you want her to come, don't make this an issue. Set up a pack and play and maybe the baby will nap most of the time. Only kind of kidding on that. Gets the doll out of the room during the meal and she's not being asked to chose between family and whats she's associated as her child.", "NTA. Tell her to get therapy. Nothing wrong with refusing to participate in another's delusions.", "Your sister needs help. Barring her from family gatherings (which is effectively what this would do) is only likely to make things worse since she'll end up more isolated with the doll. I don't know what the best move forward here is, but I suggest you discuss it with your own therapist (you can't force her to get help, but you could get professional support in trying to help your sister) before making a move like this.", "YTA. Has she gotten professional help? If not, maybe help her see someone and don't take away the one thing she has to deal with trauma. I mean, unless you want your dinner to go from bad to worse.", "YWBTA \n\nRealistically if you ask that she\u2019s not going to come and you know it.", "YWBTA. I would not ask her to leave the doll at home until she has been seeing a therapist to learn alternate coping techniques. Just invite her and ignore the doll. At some point try to have a conversation with her about it. Don\u2019t use \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d or \u201cthis is creepy\u201d language. Tell her you are concerned about her and suggest therapy.", "YWBTA.\n\nI agree that it\u2019s creepy and unhealthy, but it sounds like this is the only thing holding her together right now.\n\nIt might be time for a family conversation about the benefits of therapy, not aimed just at her but more about how everyone can benefit from have an impartial person to talk things through with.", "Stop being an asshole and get her the correct therapy so she can let go of the doll in a healthy manner, instead of taking something of sentimental value and replacing it with nothing", "YWBTA\n\nI don\u2019t know what the answer is but this isn\u2019t it.", "YWBTA for sure.  She isn\u2019t hurting anyone by bringing the doll.  But, you could cause her a lot of harm if you ask her not to bring it or shun her.  She is still grieving.  She needs therapy, but she doesn\u2019t need your judgement.  You have no idea what that poor woman is going thorough.  Everyone handles grief differently.  Have some grace.", "YTA- people grieve differently and it\u2019s not hurting anybody", "NAH. You'll have to accept that the doll is now part of her existence. I think forcing or issuing ultimatums will end poorly. She's not in her right mind, but will only get help when she's ready to accept it. Just be as supportive as you can, even if it is weird AF.", "YWBTA yes it sounds unhealthy but your sister will hear \u201cleave the baby at home \u201c\nIf you want to see your sister you have to accept she needs to bring the doll.\nI don\u2019t know the answer for making her get therapy when she\u2019s not harming herself (physically) or at risk of harming others.\nIs she single?", "Im not sure. Is she seeing a therapist who agrees it's still helpful? Because it certainly doesnt sound like shes coping well, though there isn't really a \"correct way\" to cope, but i just dont think this is it, this long after it happened\n\nI have a reborn because 1) i have always liked dolls and still do, 2) dressing him up in cute clothes helps me deal with baby fever, and 3) holding a baby has actually been proven to help with anxiety. I certainly don't think he's real though, and I don't play feed him (anymore, lolll), unless i was filming a YT video or something.\n\ni'd say yes, YWBTA, but at the same time, try your best (in whatever roll you have in her life) to help her work through her grief in a possibly healthier way.\n\nBut then again, maybe stripping her of the doll (not necessarily forever) might act like a wake up call for her? But, personally, i  would probably do the previous.", "YWBTA. I agree, it doesn't sound like the healthiest coping mechanism, but it's what she has right now, and telling her not to bring the doll will only result in your sister not coming to Easter at all. I'd worry that you'd inadvertently create distance between your sister and the *healthy* support of your family, and she might end up becoming more dependent on the doll as a result.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As long as it\u2019s not said in a mocking sort of way. If it\u2019s said right \u2014 that is: with care, compassion, and sensitivity \u2014 perhaps OP\u2019s sister will see that while other\u2019s may not understand her grief, they\u2019re still there to support her no matter what. \n\nThis is the only way the sister knows how to handle her grief. She likely feels alone in her grief and like no one understands and that she\u2019s going through the motions alone. OP already said they don\u2019t bring up the doll due to the sensitive nature. However, I would wager that their silence regarding the doll is actually sending a very loud message to the sister. She knows that the lack of acknowledgment is actually just carefully disguised judgment. She also knows that their reaction would be totally different if it were the real child [that she lost] instead of the doll\u2026which just compounds the situation even more because she already feels lost, perhaps like a failure even (to be clear: she\u2019s not at all, but we\u2019re sometimes our own worst critics) due to losing the child, as well as the demise of her marriage, and now the idea that she maybe feels like she failed her family (she didn\u2019t!) because she knows their complete silence and lack of acknowledgment towards the doll would not be so if the doll were actually the child. So she\u2019s probably feeling like she let everyone down. \n\nI can understand how the OP thinks it\u2019s best to just stay mum whenever the doll is mentioned or present, but it\u2019s actually isolating the sister even more, since the silence is really just judgment. This is only leading the sister to feeling more alone and falling deeper into her coping strategy. \n\nSometimes when we\u2019re in the thick of it, we just need to feel validated and like we\u2019re not crazy in order to feel less alone. And when it\u2019s others we care about who are going through a tough time that we don\u2019t necessarily understand, sometimes we just need to go along with the whacky things that we maybe also don\u2019t understand in order to make them feel validated and less alone. \n\nThe sister\u2019s coping strategy is not harming anyone here as it stands now, but being pushed further into isolation may eventually lead to that. So being less judgmental and more supportive could do wonders here.", "You are NOT supposed to show the reborn doll to your family and ask them to treat it as it's real. You are supposed to take care of the doll in private to help cope with what could of been but acknowledge that it's not real. The reborn doll has been shown to help with grief when used properly, this specific subreddit has a few posts precisely about people misusing the doll.\n\nOne in particular is where a woman threatens her extremely young nephew to treat the real doll as if it's his cousin, this is NOT a proper use for the reborn doll. \n\nAny OTHER use is harmful. The sister is an asshole because you are given many, many warnings about the proper use for these kinds of dolls and forcing family to interact with it is extremely cruel.", "I like this option, even if it's a joke. Ideally I don't want to feed into this but I understand that banning the doll wouldn't be the answer. \n\nThanks for your input.", "This is actually, as \u201ckind of\u201d kidding as you are, quite a good solution. Even if this is a ridiculous coping mechanism or seemingly unhealthy it\u2019s the one that\u2019s currently working for her in her situation right now.

Therapy was the only thing to help me get through the experience of almost losing my child, so I can't imagine how much more difficult it is for your sister. You are only coming from a place of love and concern for her. I think most people get that. But if the doll is her coping mechanism and she hasn't yet had any therapy, I think she's going to need therapy to learn to live without it.

But your sister is in an extremely difficult moment in her life she lost a baby and her husband left her, while I understand that the doll is not a perfect coping mechanism.\n\nBanning the doll won't help your sister and might even push her away to the deep end. \n\nMy suggestion is if you care about her is try looking for grief counselors or therapist who specialise at child loss or something similar and tell her that you love her ,care about her and when she is ready you can give her the contacts of the counselors. \n\nLet your sister live the life she could've had for now, don't be an AH especially on Easter.\n\nI hope you're sister feels better soon", "NAH, but your sister needs professional help, and quickly.

Should you bring up the children she lost?  Should you have a small memorial basket at Easter for that child?  A moment of silence before the meal?  a simple prayer?  \n\nIMO, your sister is massively struggling and I think you have a responsibility to gently nudge her to talk about her real child in hopes that it will allow her to process her grief.  I would not restrict the doll.  I would talk about the doll and the deceased baby.  I hope your sister gets better.\n\nNo judgement because I think your just trying to figure out how to do the right thing and aren\u2019t sure what that is.", "NAH, but she needs grief councilling. This route helps in the short term, but isn't health in the long term", "NAH. \n\nYou are in a very difficult situation here. As you said, your sister has gone through two massive upheavals in her life at around the same time. Just one of those would devastate even the strongest of people, so two at once has broken her in ways that most of us can\u2019t comprehend.  \n\nTo the majority of rational people, these re-born dolls are creepy. Sadly, at the moment, your sister is far from rational. I would lay odds that she is feeling an immense amount of guilt. Sadly, guilt is a familiar emotion for people to feel when they lose a child. Add on to this that she will, I believe, think that it\u2019s her fault her husband left\u2026\u2026.I\u2019m not surprised that she is acting irrationally. This doll has become her coping mechanism, her crutch. Is that healthy?  Yes and no. Yes, because she needs something to focus on, something to care for in place of the baby and husband she lost. At the moment, this doll is providing her a comfort that nothing else (in her mind) can bring. \n\nHaving said that, the notion that she believes the doll is real is worrying. If something were to happen to the doll, it was taken away, it broke, it got lost etc, the likelihood is that this would be yet another emotional crisis that her poor brain couldn\u2019t handle. \n\nIf I were in your shoes I would keep quiet about the negative side of the doll. At the moment she needs it. Her brain is healing and eventually I hope, for her sake, that she will be able to let go of her crutch. We know that therapy will help but she is going through so much that the stress of therapy (and it is stressful) may be too much. Be gentle with her, make sure that other family members know not to be confrontational with her or mock her. I would suggest a family meeting with everyone except your sister to make sure you\u2019re all on the same page. She needs gentle support, love and, in time and with healing, encouragement to talk to a professional about her losses. In the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s just a doll, but to her, right now, it\u2019s everything. \n\nGood luck.", "That\u2019s really sad but she needs help you can\u2019t give her.

Denial has always been a coping mechanism to protect someone until ready to affront that problem. And not only in grief. \nWhat is risky here is the there is not supervision of a therapist or even a psychiatrist and the bond with the doll could become unhealthy and not help the patient in the long run. Treating the doll like a real thing to make ease on the loss and believing she is real are of course two very different things. And a professional supervision is something should be done. That said not everybody is ready to ask for help and sometime if someone is not ready help can not be given. \nEdit: also using subreddit as what should and should\u2019t be done on medical, psychiatrical field are like comparing YouTube video to a medical visit.

Which there's nothing wrong with that, when you have your own life and your own kids you have to focus on that. You have to focus on your priorities over someone else's. But, you cannot claim that someone is just as important to you as your own priorities, if your actions do not match it. Especially in a tough tricky delicate situation like this.\nThere is nothing wrong with prioritizing yourself and your family first, but you cannot claim to have the same level of dedication and care to someone else if you are not showing those actions.

For the short term, I would recommend a fictional babysitter for the doll, so she can enjoy your party. But in general, you're going to need to help your sister get therapy. She doesn't have dementia, she shouldn't think the doll is actually real. That should be a major concern for her loved ones, especially if she is currently living alone. I personally think she should move in with a relative or go to a reputable inpatient psych ward. This isn't normal behavior, and I'm not a doctor, but I assume this will only get worse the longer it's left unaddressed. \n\nFor the short term: With my grandma's doll we use a fictional babysitter to make her feel at ease when she's without the doll.

I also apologise in advance if this turns into a bit of a trauma dump. and it's probably going to get lost in the sea of comments anyway, but I really hope you see this.\n\nI was your sister. Sort of.  \n\nI lost a baby to stillbirth,  it was sudden, unexpected, everything was fine until it wasn't (cord accident).  It had taken us 6 years to conceive, and just to add insult to injury, another baby was born into the family six days after our son was stillborn. \n\nMy relationship broke down, and while we later reconciled, it was never really the same again.  I couldn't handle how everyone in my life, including my partner left me alone in my grief to celebrate the other baby, it was a betrayal I ultimately couldn't get over.  I am not at all saying your family has been like this, just trying to explain that I was in a similar porition.  Lost child, broken relationship and if you haven't felt the grief of losing a child, you can't understand.  I don't say that to be mean or condescending, but it really is a grief like nothing I have ever experienced. Compounded by not being able to conceive  again.\n\nMy reborn saved my life.  Dramatic sounding?  Yes.  But I honestly believe without him I would have ended up taking my own life.  I wasn't living, I was existing.\n\nI never really thought he was a real baby, but I did many of the things your sister is doing.  He \"slept\" in a moses basket, I took him out with me in a pram or the car seat. Dressed him up every day. watched endless youtube videos of other reborns, \"fed\" him with a bottle of fake milk.  I felt like I had to prove I would have been a good mother, that it wasn't my fault my baby had died.  Look how much atention and care I gave him, how he came first. \n\nI did have therapy, and my therapist was actually very understanding about me having him and how I saw him and treated him, I even took him to my therapy appointments.\n\nGradually I got less intense about him, gradually dropped more and more of the mothering behaviours as I worked through my grief.  It's been seven years for me and while I still have him and probably always will because he's a big part of my journey and still a comfort to me at times, he mostly just sits in a little chair in my room, I change his outfit a couple of times a year and cuddle him when I'm feeling particularly low, but he's not nearly the big part of my life and coping mechanisms that he used to be.\n\nA year isn't really that long in terms of grief.  On average it takes us 18-24 months to griev a loss, and a traumatic loss will always take longer, and if the anniversary is coming up/just passed it will feel extra raw.\n\nI was very aware of how people thought I was weird, creepy or crazy, but given the alternatives, it was the better option for me.\n\nPlease give your sister some time and some support.  Don't expect her to be over losing her child and understand that we all grieve and process grief in different ways.

It sounds like she's in survival mode right now. I didn't get a doll but I loved on my dog a possibly abnormal amount during those months because I needed to put the frantic, hormonal drive to nurture somewhere.

Then it would be people she'd presumably trust to \u201ctake care of her baby\u201d \u2013 you(?), your parents, other siblings and niblings? \u2013 who each get to pop out for 15-20 minutes, half an hour, whatever, to read a book or catch up on social media on your phone, while the rest get to interact with a hopefully calm sister who won't have to fret about her \u201cbaby\u201d being \u201clooked after\u201d by someone unknown. Maybe make sure to check in with each other and sister at the changings of the guard, (\u201cIs she still asleep?\u201d \u201cDo you want me to check if her nappy needs changing?\u201d [If you think she'll trust any of you with that], etc), to show you're playing along, if you think it'll help / she'll buy that.\n\nMaybe that will even make her feel comfortable / secure enough to talk to the others about how long she thinks she'll need to keep this up, and how you all can help her move on. Not quite \u201cintervention\u201d-style, but a sincere conversation. Yeah, a bit of a cognitive dissonance discussing the charade as such while also keeping it up... But she _does_ still consciously know it's just a doll, right? Then maybe everyone could handle that dissonance, as long as the rest of you keep reminding yourselves that validating someone's feelings is one thing and discussing those same feelings is another. Just ask her as she gets there, \u201cDo you want [Baby Doll's Name] to rest on the sofa / in her pram in the side room here? When you've got her settled in, should I / Mom / whoever look after her for a spell, while you catch up with everyone else?\u201d.\n\nNOTE / DISCLAIMER: Just a wild-ass-guess suggestion, absolutely __NOT__ psychological / psychiatric advice, which I am in no way qualified to give.", "This should be higher up! While loving her and supporting her maybe someone could do research on the best therapist for her problem. If she felt loved and supported maybe she would be brave enough to get help.", "Hell I\u2019m just happy they\u2019re not using much needed formula for the baby. There was a lady a while back that went viral during the formula shortage because she had bought a bunch of it and was literally wasting it for her reborn dolls while parents were traveling far distances just to try and find the right formulas for their actual hungry kids. \n\nI agree that the sister needs help but worried that if OP chooses Easter to start shit she\u2019ll spiral and get worse and isolate. If she does confront her she has yo do it carefully otherwise it\u2019s going to blow up in their faces and could make her worse", "I stand corrected. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss", "Sounds that way to me. She\u2019s avoiding actually dealing with her grief, which is extremely unhealthy.", "This is a great idea!", "FYI Ryan Gosling stars.", "The point is this a therapist should address her problem, there is a point where therapist themselves (I married a psychiatrist) will play along with patients fantasy if not harmful to them or other until they are ready to accept reality. Nor she should become the subject of ridicule or speculation by none professional. This is a serious loss, people can kill themselves if they can\u2019t find a channel for this kind of grief.", "I have a friend who is only alive today because a bunch of us staged an intervention and sent him to rehab. My husband doorstepped his parents (whom we'd never met); we flew 4000 miles to surprise him on his doorstep, along with a bunch of local friends. We love him. He was furiously angry with us. We accompanied him on a plane - blind drunk - to a rehab several states away.\n\nWe're seven years out now. His liver has recovered to the point where he no longer needs a transplant. He's forgiven us. He's doing really well, in a great job, and we're talking all the time: it's great. I can't say that it's forever: but my good buddy has lived for seven years longer - at least - than he would have, and that's because a lot of us loved him and did an intervention. And we keep checking in.\n\nIf anybody here wants to talk about this, please feel free to DM me. We worked with an intervention therapist, which made everything surprisingly staightforward - and who was really helpful for everybody else who was emotionally involved.", "I had thought about doing an intervention for my mom who was a hoarder who was also in chronic pain but refused to go to a doctor or therapist. I didn't do it because I was afraid she would hate me as a result.", "I've been there: I can't say enough good words about the intervention therapist that we worked with when my friend was in a very bad place. \n\nHand on heart: if we hadn't hired that woman he wouldn't be around today. There are modes of thinking that alcoholics and other addicts get into that it's nearly impossible to navigate if you're sober - a really good professional who can guide the conversation was literally lifesaving for us..", "thats completely valid. some people may not respond well to an intervention no matter how you do it, and some people just arent built to host an intervention. neither of these things are wrong, theyre just facts. \n\nits never the wrong decision to hold off on hosting an intervention if you think it\u2019ll do more damage than good. only you can judge whether or not thats the case, but its better to hold off and provide whatever support you can than potentially blow up a relationship and burn that bridge", "NAH - two issues here - how to help her and whether a ban will do so. \n\nBanning the doll will not help. \n\nI am really sorry and I feel for her. The problem is she is not doing something that will help her grieve and get over her loss. I have seen this a lot with people who have lost children (especially on reddit, but RL people too) and I think because losing a child is siuch a huge, crushing thing, people don't feel that they can step in, even if the person is acting in a way that is really harmful to themselves.\n\nLetting someone grieve in their own way is the right thing to do. Letting someone do this is not helping them. \n\nGood luck OP and to your whole family.", "Technically - YWNBTA.\n\nBut...\n\nI am a bit sensitive toward people dealing with issues and family not being there.  Perhaps this event would be a golden opportunity to quietly have a grief counsellor join the party.  It sounds like your sister needs help - for me it would be all about which is more important, helping my sis or having the perfect party?  \n\nI have always wanted to help because I always NEEDED help and didn't get it.  So - if she is refusing therapy and has lost her primary support (husband), who is left to help her?  You are absolutely not obligated, but I guess it would nice/supportive/helpful to try to help your sister through a really rough thing.  Complex grief can mess a person up.  If you are a mental health professional how would you help this person if she was not your sister?  \n\nIf you are NOT a mental health professional, you need to get one involved.  Your opinion on how healthy vs unhealthy this coping mechanism is not helping.  Get some help for your sister who obviously needs it.", "I'd ask her to get a sitter...but I am an asshole.", "I'm not sure there's a code for \"well meaning but hopelessly ill-advised\"? NAH I suppose. Obviously your sister has a serious problem with this doll, but neither you nor anyone here is qualified to say how to go about fixing it. You clearly ae concerned for her and think telling her not to bring it might help her get over it, but frankly there's no way of knowing what reaction you'll get or whether it will simply make everything worse. Only someone treating her (and she needs treatment) is going to be able to make that call.\nIn the absence of professional advice, your best bet is to say nothing about the doll at all - don't support or encourage the delusionbof course, but don't try arguing about it or challenging it or trying to talk her out of it because you haven't a clue what you are doing. It's sad to see your sister ill, but you're not a doctor and your job is to love her, be with her and try to give her as much normalcy as you are able in the circumstances, I would have thought.", "As someone who recently lost their baby boy to trisomy 18, YWBTA. There are other ways to approach this situation with your sister that have been mentioned here already. \n\nShe probably feels incredibly alone, and the doll helps her feel less so. Not sure if this was mentioned, but maybe if she adopts a pet she will have something to dote on, to baby. I say that because our dog was that for me..and I feel like that saved me in so many ways.", "NAH I think this is above reddits pay grade. No good will come from you outright banning the doll from a family gathering. Your sister obviously needs help but this is a very sensitive topic and needs to be handled with care and consideration.", "Very gentle YTA. I don't even think you are an asshole, just asking her to not bring it would be an asshole move. \n\nIs this the healthiest thing for her to be doing? No, but it could be much worse. She isn't harming anybody and just because others think it's creepy doesn't mean it's wrong. If it helps her please just try to accept it. A year is not very long, she needs time.\n\nTreat her little baby doll like it's real. She will be so happy. Figure the rest out later.", "IDK, this sounds like it could be approaching psychosis territory in which case other people actively going along with her delusions could further sever her ties to reality, even if meant as a kindness. It also wouldn't be helpful to tell her that it isn't real since she's heavy in denial, it's recommended to make it about how they're feeling instead. Like answering \"My baby is sick\" with \"I'm sorry, how does that make you feel?\" instead of \"Your baby isn't real\" or \"Have you taken her to the doctor?\". I'd say to continue providing a supportive environment, her feeling judged won't help and not having the doll won't make the reasons she has one disappear, but not actively participate or agree that the baby is real. Unless she says or does something that shows that she does know that her baby is a doll, but if she's broken away from reality then you don't want to make it worse. Or you don't want to push her in that direction, because just about anyone can have a psychotic break in the right conditions and these are def the right conditions.", "I really hope OP reads this.  Surround her with love.  So important.", "such a horrifying amazing show!", "This.  Even if it has to be court ordered.", "Something I've found useful from other people when dealing with BigShitTM is when people ask heaps of questions. Not necessarily prying or pointed ones, but questions that come from genuine curiosity and a desire to meet me where I'm at.\n\nIt gets you to engage with your own thinking, and you find yourself making connections and realizations you would normally have achieved sitting by yourself and thinking about it.", "I'm confused about who you think would have given her these warnings? These reborn dolls are for sale all over the place.  I agree that the reborn doll is being misused but it's not because she's an A H it's because she's very very unwell at present.  She needs help, not to be shamed.", "Thank you for correcting me on the title.", "Not so much. I did check the site out when I first heard about them, the dolls, in the early 2000's or 90's long before the movie.. They are very interesting actually. There is a documentary on the people that purchase them. That too is interesting.", "We don't know it's delusion. It would be delusional if she thought the doll is a living child, but we don't know that. She bought it herself, she knows it's a doll. It seems to me like she wants to do the things the would be doing with her child. Changing nappies, feeding it, carrying it around to see family, and yes, even staying home because it is 'sick', this is all part of the experience of having a baby that life has denied her.\n\nI'll admit that I would find it creepy (one of my sisters has got one of those dolls and I hate it) but I could see myself wanting to do those things if my baby died."]}
