She needs therapy, badly, and while you can't force her to do that, trying to force it is not the answer. Your heart is in the right place, but it might be better to approach her about therapy first.", "Technically, YWNBTA for asking her not to bring the doll, but only technically. It's your home, and as the host, you hav the right to ask. But it's a bad idea. I'd wager that it's more likely that your sister wouldn't come to Easter at all rather than leave the doll at home.\n\nIf you want to get your sister to focus more in the family, you'd do better to have a babysitter for the doll (yes, someone to watch the doll for her), though depending on where she is, she may not be okay with that (or may only be OK with it for a few hours).\n\nWhile I get it makes you uncomfortable, it sounds like a much more healthy coping mechanism that risk seeking, drugs, alcohol, and myriad other methods that people who are grieving great personal loss might turn to. Have you spoken to a professional (psychologist, therapist, gried counselor, etc.) about how best to approach the situation?", "I feel like you need to approach her and express your worries and ask how you can help, rather than just tell her she\u2019s not allowed the only thing that\u2019s helping her cope. Maybe sit down with her and tell her that you love her and are worried, and that you\u2019d love to hear more about her actual baby and how she is doing. Maybe get her a sentimental piece of jewelry or something similar with the baby\u2019s birth stone, or a blanket with baby\u2019s name that she can keep on her bed? It\u2019s known that tangible items can help with grieving, she just happened to choose an item that makes some people uncomfortable.", "NAH, though it a very shitty situation for everyone to be in. It is very clear that your sister is suffering very much from her recent loss of her child and the ending of her marriage. Your sister is indeed coping, and it isn't healthy unless she is actively in therapy, and there is a plan to help her move past the doll being a substitute for her lost child. \n\nSpeaking of that, you could also be dealing with the grief, and you choose to accept it and want to force her to, but we all have our own paths through grief and trauma. I don't think this is the correct subreddit to really look for answers, and it might be best to let her be, but I would suggest if your sister isn't in therapy you may want to consult a grief counselor or therapist on how best to navigate your sister through moving past the doll. I can see very real and serious concerns here.", "Just ask her if the doll has any food allergies and get on with the day. Leave her alone.", "This is way above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. I\u2019m not sure any of us can judge how to help wean your sister off her doll (you included).\nI would not try to separate her from the doll or make her feel judged for needing it. The more supported and loved she feels the better. \nUnfortunately I do think you\u2019d be TA, but I hope you find some professional guidance on how to support her.", "YWBTA The doll probably isn't a healthy coping mechanism but what do you think you'll accomplish with this? She'll show up without the doll and suddenly realize she doesn't need it and her grief will be healed?  I don't think so.  What will happen is you'll create a lot of drama and angst and she'll still be struggling. I'm not sure how to help her but making her leave her doll home for a family dinner isn't it.", "I'm a bit surprised at some of the vitriol in the comment section. NAH.\n\nYour sister is traumatized, the doll is a coping mechanism, albeit an unhealthy and ultimately unhelpful one. Your sister isn't an asshole for using a psychological crutch; it may be the only thing keeping her going right now.\n\nYou aren't an asshole for not wanting to have to humour that crutch, especially when it's interfering with your sister's ability to interact with people, as well as confront & process her own grief.\n\nYour sister desperately needs therapy (which I'm certain you already know). The doll is stunting her grieving process; as long as she treats the doll as a real baby, she doesn't have to figure out how to live life now that it has a massive hole in it. This dependence will get more entrenched the longer it goes on, and complicated grief will put more strain on her the longer it goes untreated (speaking from experience here, nearly killed me lol).\n\nI'd let her bring the doll, and I wouldn't make mention of it during the get-together. But I'd also talk with other family members pretty soon about trying to nudge her towards getting into therapy, which I assume she isn't in yet.\n\nGrief looks different for everyone, and it isn't a steady, predictable process. But this type of grief transference gets more unhealthy the longer it goes on. There's no 'recovery' from losing a child; she will always be grieving that loss. But the doll is a blockade, and it will keep her mentally and emotionally stationary in that place and unable to move forward for as long as she keeps treating it like a real infant.\n\nNo assholes here; just the fallout of a terrible situation. Encourage her to research therapists near her--or grief groups. Do some research of your own to help her out if she's resistant to the idea. If you're in a city, most in North America will have resources for grieving parents; hospitals, therapy offices, and Planned Parenthood should all have info for you.", "NAH, but what is most alarming is that she truly believes it's real. That's a very scary delusion that if left unchecked can develop into something much worse. This isn't about Easter dinner, she really really needs therapy, and I know you said she declined, so I would talk to a professional and see what they suggest. For the time being though,  maybe just let her bring it.", "Not an expert, but I wonder if your sister needs inpatient therapy given her apparent detachment from reality.", "YTA- she's not hurting anyone by doing this. It's odd from an outside perspective sure, but thankfully I have no idea what it's like to lose a child. She could probably benefit from some therapy if she hasn't gone down that road already, but ultimately I think if you want her to come, don't make this an issue. Set up a pack and play and maybe the baby will nap most of the time. Only kind of kidding on that. Gets the doll out of the room during the meal and she's not being asked to chose between family and whats she's associated as her child.", "NTA. Tell her to get therapy. Nothing wrong with refusing to participate in another's delusions.", "Your sister needs help. Barring her from family gatherings (which is effectively what this would do) is only likely to make things worse since she'll end up more isolated with the doll. I don't know what the best move forward here is, but I suggest you discuss it with your own therapist (you can't force her to get help, but you could get professional support in trying to help your sister) before making a move like this.", "YTA. Has she gotten professional help? If not, maybe help her see someone and don't take away the one thing she has to deal with trauma. I mean, unless you want your dinner to go from bad to worse.", "YWBTA \n\nRealistically if you ask that she\u2019s not going to come and you know it.", "YWBTA. I would not ask her to leave the doll at home until she has been seeing a therapist to learn alternate coping techniques. Just invite her and ignore the doll. At some point try to have a conversation with her about it. Don\u2019t use \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d or \u201cthis is creepy\u201d language. Tell her you are concerned about her and suggest therapy.", "YWBTA.\n\nI agree that it\u2019s creepy and unhealthy, but it sounds like this is the only thing holding her together right now.\n\nIt might be time for a family conversation about the benefits of therapy, not aimed just at her but more about how everyone can benefit from have an impartial person to talk things through with.", "Stop being an asshole and get her the correct therapy so she can let go of the doll in a healthy manner, instead of taking something of sentimental value and replacing it with nothing", "YWBTA\n\nI don\u2019t know what the answer is but this isn\u2019t it.", "YWBTA for sure.  She isn\u2019t hurting anyone by bringing the doll.  But, you could cause her a lot of harm if you ask her not to bring it or shun her.  She is still grieving.  She needs therapy, but she doesn\u2019t need your judgement.  You have no idea what that poor woman is going thorough.  Everyone handles grief differently.  Have some grace.", "YTA- people grieve differently and it\u2019s not hurting anybody", "NAH. You'll have to accept that the doll is now part of her existence. I think forcing or issuing ultimatums will end poorly. She's not in her right mind, but will only get help when she's ready to accept it. Just be as supportive as you can, even if it is weird AF.", "YWBTA yes it sounds unhealthy but your sister will hear \u201cleave the baby at home \u201c\nIf you want to see your sister you have to accept she needs to bring the doll.\nI don\u2019t know the answer for making her get therapy when she\u2019s not harming herself (physically) or at risk of harming others.\nIs she single?", "Im not sure. Is she seeing a therapist who agrees it's still helpful? Because it certainly doesnt sound like shes coping well, though there isn't really a \"correct way\" to cope, but i just dont think this is it, this long after it happened\n\nI have a reborn because 1) i have always liked dolls and still do, 2) dressing him up in cute clothes helps me deal with baby fever, and 3) holding a baby has actually been proven to help with anxiety. I certainly don't think he's real though, and I don't play feed him (anymore, lolll), unless i was filming a YT video or something.\n\ni'd say yes, YWBTA, but at the same time, try your best (in whatever roll you have in her life) to help her work through her grief in a possibly healthier way.\n\nBut then again, maybe stripping her of the doll (not necessarily forever) might act like a wake up call for her? But, personally, i  would probably do the previous.", "YWBTA. I agree, it doesn't sound like the healthiest coping mechanism, but it's what she has right now, and telling her not to bring the doll will only result in your sister not coming to Easter at all. I'd worry that you'd inadvertently create distance between your sister and the *healthy* support of your family, and she might end up becoming more dependent on the doll as a result.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If so she might be experiencing a break from reality and might need serious psychiatric help.", "No idea honestly\n\nSide note: Those dolls give me nightmares. They\u2019re just creepy to me. I saw one that a lady had commissioned to look exactly like her dead baby AFTER he had died. The doll was literally gray-blue with glazed over eyes. Horrifying.\n\nBut back to you. I feel so awful for your sister. She sounds like she\u2019s one more tragedy away from a mental break. It\u2019s not fair or appropriate for her to force you guys to interact with the doll, though. So she\u2019s TA for forcing you to further engage with her trauma when you are an unwilling participant. But you are not TA for not wanting to entertain this or interact with it.\n\nHonestly, do what you will. I have no freakin clue how to handle this.

She declined.", "Right, maybe tell her in some other ways, but it\u2019s understandable, it\u2019s probably awkward for everyone. Either that or not invite her.", "When you put it like that - that she could be seeking out more risky coping mechanisms - it put it in perspective for me. Thank you.\n\nI see a therapist monthly and have had more important topics to discuss outside of my sisters coping mechanisms. I will ask them about this next time I see them.", "Best answer yet. As long as it\u2019s not said in a mocking sort of way. If it\u2019s said right \u2014 that is: with care, compassion, and sensitivity \u2014 perhaps OP\u2019s sister will see that while other\u2019s may not understand her grief, they\u2019re still there to support her no matter what. \n\nThis is the only way the sister knows how to handle her grief. She likely feels alone in her grief and like no one understands and that she\u2019s going through the motions alone. OP already said they don\u2019t bring up the doll due to the sensitive nature. However, I would wager that their silence regarding the doll is actually sending a very loud message to the sister. She knows that the lack of acknowledgment is actually just carefully disguised judgment. She also knows that their reaction would be totally different if it were the real child [that she lost] instead of the doll\u2026which just compounds the situation even more because she already feels lost, perhaps like a failure even (to be clear: she\u2019s not at all, but we\u2019re sometimes our own worst critics) due to losing the child, as well as the demise of her marriage, and now the idea that she maybe feels like she failed her family (she didn\u2019t!) because she knows their complete silence and lack of acknowledgment towards the doll would not be so if the doll were actually the child. So she\u2019s probably feeling like she let everyone down. \n\nI can understand how the OP thinks it\u2019s best to just stay mum whenever the doll is mentioned or present, but it\u2019s actually isolating the sister even more, since the silence is really just judgment. This is only leading the sister to feeling more alone and falling deeper into her coping strategy. \n\nSometimes when we\u2019re in the thick of it, we just need to feel validated and like we\u2019re not crazy in order to feel less alone. And when it\u2019s others we care about who are going through a tough time that we don\u2019t necessarily understand, sometimes we just need to go along with the whacky things that we maybe also don\u2019t understand in order to make them feel validated and less alone. \n\nThe sister\u2019s coping strategy is not harming anyone here as it stands now, but being pushed further into isolation may eventually lead to that. So being less judgmental and more supportive could do wonders here.", "You are NOT supposed to show the reborn doll to your family and ask them to treat it as it's real. You are supposed to take care of the doll in private to help cope with what could of been but acknowledge that it's not real. The reborn doll has been shown to help with grief when used properly, this specific subreddit has a few posts precisely about people misusing the doll.\n\nOne in particular is where a woman threatens her extremely young nephew to treat the real doll as if it's his cousin, this is NOT a proper use for the reborn doll. \n\nAny OTHER use is harmful. The sister is an asshole because you are given many, many warnings about the proper use for these kinds of dolls and forcing family to interact with it is extremely cruel.", "I like this option, even if it's a joke. Ideally I don't want to feed into this but I understand that banning the doll wouldn't be the answer. \n\nThanks for your input.", "This is actually, as \u201ckind of\u201d kidding as you are, quite a good solution. Even if this is a ridiculous coping mechanism or seemingly unhealthy it\u2019s the one that\u2019s currently working for her in her situation right now. Not making a big deal over her bringing the doll and allowing it to be somewhere out of the room might let her both feel supported by you providing a bassinet for the doll and make you not have to see the thing the whole time.", "She has not gotten professional help.

It might seem more approachable than solo therapy?", "I agree with the commenter above, talking with your therapist will not only help you cope and process the situation better, but the therapist will also be able to give you tools to be able to navigate your way around all of it. \n\nUnfortunately your sister does fall into the category of \u201cmore important things\u201d if you want her in your life, especially when you\u2019re inviting her into your home and are making requests of her that she cannot meet right now.

Currently, the doll is the only thing making her feel less alone. You said yourself you have more pressing matters to discuss at therapy than your sister. Your brother mentioned therapy. As it stands now, your sister isn\u2019t receiving the support she feels she needs from you and your family right now. Instead, she\u2019s receiving judgment. And she knows it. Even if no one is saying it outright. Stop judging her; start supporting her.  You\u2019d be amazed at what can happen when someone feels like you\u2019re a safe space for them to open up to. Your judgment is hindering that.", "Time for an intervention", "I've been dealing with more pressing matters with my children and husband, plus issues on his side of the family that I've been involved in.
