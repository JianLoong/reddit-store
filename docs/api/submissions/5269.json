Child loss, having a young baby, having a six year old, and maintaining all the other tasks you have is a lot to manage.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your job to drop everything to play exactly when your six year old asks, because I think that sounds like an unreasonable expectation. If I dropped everything to play every time my children asked, there would be no clean clothes, no dinner, nothing cleaned, and my own mental state would be so shot. When you decide not to play with her because it\u2019s a game, have you tried incorporating her into what you are doing? I know it\u2019s not the same thing and sometimes having a child help makes things harder, but my 3 year old feels so proud when he helps me do the laundry or carry it upstairs. It\u2019s not play, per se, but it\u2019s still bonding and spending time together.

Board games are honestly a really broad category with a lot of interesting whole-family options.", "Think about it another way... If your stepchild was older, would you only encourage or participate in the hobbies that you share? Will you only do things that YOU want to do with them as time goes on, and neglect their own, independent interests? This is what your partner is concerned about. Yes you can have boundaries and you shouldn't drop everything to play all the time. But that isn't the only concern here.\n\nBased on your other comments, NTA, you clearly have a lot going on. But it's some food for thought.", "I\u2019ve read through a lot and here\u2019s what I think. Please disregard if not helpful.\n\n1. I am so sorry for your loss. My mom miscarried at 5 months and I myself always missed an older brother I never had. I asked about him in like 2nd grade but my mom was amazed I knew because she never told me I would have had an older brother. I have always felt it. I miss him and never met him. I get it. My mom still was sad about it. It's terrible to outlive any family but you are not alone. Hugs. \n\n2. Crying all day is a sign of depression that may require medical intervention because you may have postpartum depression on top of the grieving situation. You need to see a doctor immediately if you're feeling suicidal. There is no shame in taking care of yourself. Its like putting your oxygen mask on first in an airplane before you help a child. You have to prioritize your health before you can take care of anyone else. You matter.\n\n3. Your husband needs some parenting classes. You can go together. Ask your pediatrician for help finding one. Babies are not capable of being bad at 6 months old. They don't have the planning ability to be bad. They simply need their needs met. These classes may also help him avoid future issues with both his children.\n\n4. As a kid my mom rarely played board games and I was sad but I lived lol. Set a schedule of like one hour a day when you can devote play time to her choice of games. If she is playing aggressively, it is a sign she is in pain and needs counseling too. This should not all be on your shoulders. It's why getting a counselor involved would help the whole family. You won't have to say anything, the counselors use dolls to help kids work things out.\n\n5. You\u2019re doing a great job! You\u2019re finding ways to bond with your stepdaughter and you\u2019re working. Don\u2019t give up your job for any reason. You need that balance. It\u2019s far more important than you like to help keep your sanity and not just pay the bills.\n\n6. Try checking out Flylady.net to help you get a user friendly and fun routine for cleaning. It\u2019s pretty much free unless you want to buy something but you can print out things. I\u2019m not getting paid for this reference but I have used her checklists too. She divides the house into zones and day by day, week by week, you get the house clean and it\u2019s pretty fun and easy in 15 minute increments. You start with the kitchen sink and you\u2019ll create a control journal of checklists with her printouts. It will help you feel successful and make it fun.\n\n7. Hang in there. The depressing feelings are always temporary. They will pass. Nothing ever stays the same. Winter always turns to spring. The only thing we can count on is change. We can\u2019t change anyone else though, only ourselves. People will adapt to changes in us. \ud83d\ude09 You are doing great and it will get better. Lack of sleep is taxing to our brains with colicky babies. You need some rest and time for yourself too. Schedule it when you create your control journal.

I also can't imagine how much pain you are going through. \n\nBut yeah your stepdaughter has to be allowed to pick the way y'all bond and play together every once in a while, even if it's less fun for you.

I\u2019d also tell him I\u2019d take his parenting advice when he actually does research on it and especially on the topic of children being able to play by themselves. Look up the effects it has on children. Do you want that for your kid? Cause the positive of having your kids entertain themselves is: \n\nEmotional Regulation as children have time to decompress,\nIndependence,\nSelf-Confidence,\nImproved Problem Solving Skills,\nImproved Risk Management,\nHelps them integrate things they are learning about, Learn healthy ways to deal with boredom\n\nSo does he want a child with no confidence, not able to problem solve, not be able to be independent etc\u2026\n\nCause that\u2019s a poor excuse of a parent", "It's obvious you care and you have a lot on your plate.

He sounds very controlling.", "Yes but do you really trust him?  Please trust YOUR gut and do what you need to for you and your baby.  You need to take care of yourself too.  If you don't, who will take care of your baby? I'm sending you many hugs and hopeful thoughts!", "What?", "Your username fits so well", "And that's why he sucks because you absolutely have a point. The entire world doesn't revolve just around any one person. She does need to learn that sometimes you have to take other people's wants and interests into account and that sometimes you have to entertain yourself. That's an important lesson for anyone to learn. Just make sure that you don't swing too far in the inverse. Parenting is tough.

I'm with OP on this.", "Given all of that, I feel like as long as you and your stepdaughter enjoying your time together, then you're NTA. If you two are getting along, and having fun... then he's just attaching some of his own baggage to his accusation.\n\nAlso, he should be helping out with your poor little colicky baby!

I love that she loves dolls. But this game takes like an hour to play even when we cut out half of the rules. I rather play Uno instead of that game. We love Uno", "That's also how I feel about the her picking up his attitude. He's also an extreme worrier and she's starting to pick that up too, and that's hard for me because I'm super laid back and go with the flow, so having two worriers throwing their worries at me is hard.

My best friend has a stepdaughter that used to come play on our weeks (we have 50/50) but their custody changed and now we have our bonus kids at different times. She has friends at her moms because her mom lives with roommates who have sons.", "Oh honey. Do you have any family near by? Please please PLEASE reach out to anyone you can when those thoughts come creeping up again. \n\nYour husband is a lazy AH for pushing ALL of this on you and letting you drown.

My 8 year old is showing no sign of outgrowing them. I feel like a crappy mom every time I suggest something else because I remember how it felt when my mom never played with me.

You have suffered a huge tragedy and he should be supporting you not tearing you down. Don't allow him to do it please, think of yourself and your baby that needs you.

She usually gets out at 1 so i could do that but then her dad says I'm lazy for not cleaning", "I just want to give you a hug. You've had a lot of really hard times going on, haven't you? Grief has no time limit, especially with a loss like yours and I'm so sorry you're going through it. I know he's not here, but he will always be your son. Nothing can change that. \n\nYou definitely aren't an a-hole where your stepdaughter's concerned. My own mum never really bothered to do anything with me and you're making loads of special moments and memories with her. I know you said there's certain things you'd rather not do, but if her dad is doing them with her, then she's having special time with you and special time with her father. I get the impression that sometimes you do those things, judging by the fact you say in the title that you don't do the things she wants all of the time. So no you aren't the AH. In fact where anything is concerned here, I don't see you being the AH. \n\nThe closest person I see to being an AH is your husband. You've had a terrible loss, you've got a colicky baby that you're the primary caregiver for and he's getting on your back about the quality time you have with your stepdaughter? I could be entirely wrong here, but he doesn't seem to be very understanding or especially supportive. But I'm reluctant to call him an AH, because for all I know, he might've been a real rock to you in the past and this is a blip in his normal behaviour. He may not realise how tough things are, which is silly, but entirely plausible. I really think you should lay it out for him and explain in full detail just how you're feeling. He needs to support you. \n\nYou need help. At the risk of sounding slightly nuts, I can feel your stress and sadness through the screen and you don't deserve this! Taking care of yourself is at least equally important to taking care of your family. \n\nNTA", "This thread has me sitting here wondering if my parents even played with me\ud83d\ude02 I was an only child too. I\u2019m sure as a baby but I have no recollection of them playing with me as an elementary age child so OP Even trying as much as you have with what you\u2019re going through you should be very proud of yourself.", "you just made me cry, i'm so sorry about your brother. i am severely depressed and i feel like no one cares , everyone just expects me to be normal. but i can't. i lost my baby. he was so perfect", "also thank you for the cleaning tips i really appreciate that i don't want to be messy i want to clean to his standards, he seems to think i don't clean to spite him but i'm just depressed and it's hard", "i do! i spend at least 10-20 minutes a day doing an activity she enjoys that i don't enjoy, but it's not always playing with her dolls it could be playing with other toys or playing a video game that i don't really like. but because it's not with her dolls she and her dad see it as me not playing with her.", "\"but because it's not with her dolls she and her dad see it as me not playing with her.\"\n\nI mean I threw out dolls as a random example so is he making \"not playing dolls\" the issue or \"not playing how she wants\"\n\nThis whole situation is not working and you need to talk to your husband about the fact that you are grieving and having a sick child less than a year old. You cannot be playmate for this girl. \n\nI will say, again, I cannot stress how much I mean as AFTER things calm down, you may have to spend more time with her letting her pick the activity. But that is so far in the future and NTA now\n\nGood luck", "thank you, i definitely have some things to think about. i'm exhausted", "Please seek a therapist  dealing  with grief and depression. All the best  and nta", "Look, you need to start holding this stuff against him. He sounds abusive which is dangerous for you at the best of times, let alone when you're struggling this much. Can you speak to a counsellor?", "Hey, I'm sorry for your loss and that you are struggling.\n\nMy mom never had much time to play with me. She had a lot on her plate too. I did a lot of similar stuff with her like your stepdaughter does with you, but she always said no if I asked her to play a game or whatever. It was ok, and I knew why she said no.\n\nHowever, dad did play with me (board games, cards). Does your husband do that? He should when/if you can't."]}
