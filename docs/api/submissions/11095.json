I treat my kids the exact same when it comes to finances and earning stuff. The oldest got a phone at 13, so the other kids had to wait until they were 13 to get a phone. You get the gist. \n\n I saved from every paycheck for 16 years to put into the car account. When my oldest turned 16, I divided it by 4, and boom, that was the amount each kid got from me to spend on a car. Any extra was on them. The amount each kid gets to spend on a car is 10k. It'll get you a nice used one, but the catch is you pay for gas by chores or a job after school (insurance is on me and my wife). I can agree that 10 years ago when my oldest bought a car it was a bit of a different market and I asked her and her brother when the 18 yr old was ready to drive if they would be value of the car they got vs the money amount and they both said to make up for inflation to add 5k to each of their car budgets\n\nSo 2 years ago year, my 18 yr old got 15k to spend on a car, now like her older siblings, she was a saver, not a spender, unlike my youngest. Our 17 year old decided last year to put the 10k into a cd savings account for 1 year, worked part time during the school year, worked fulltime on school breaks, saved money doing by chores around the house, saved her birthday money, didn't go out with friends, for Christmas asked for things she needed for school like new shoes instead of games, sold her clothes that don't fit, used her sisters dress for junior prom and pocketed the money, and babysat her cousins ext.  She saved then spent it on a brand new 2023 Honda CRV paid for in cash. (Her reasoning is Hondas last forever, and a CRV is big enough for college moving and stuff) (so overall saved 15k in 2 years) \n\nNow it's our son's turn. On his birthday, he wanted to go to the dealership, and we did. He took us to the truck he wanted a 2020 Chevy. With a 25k price tag. We explained to him that we were not buying him a 25k truck. He said well with inflation from when his siblings bought a car and the 18 yr old getting a brand new car he thought he could get this one. I told him that's not how it worked. Each one of his siblings got 10k, and his sister worked her ass off for the new car. He should pick a 15k car or do what his sister did and save for a new one. He said it's not fair because his siblings get more than him due to the sheer value of the cars alone. I offered if he wanted (I did this with all my kids) I would sell him my car for the 15k (a 2018 ford f250). He asked me what I would get and I said I've been saving for a new truck anyway so I would buy a new truck. He immediately said take me home I don't want to be here. So we did. Now he's speaking out on social media about how the youngest children always get the short end of the stick. \n\nSo reddit AITA for treating my kids exactly the same?\n\nEdit: changed  one 17 to 18 type because of my fat fingers.", "created_utc": 1677544415, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11drvcc/aita_for_treating_my_kids_the_exact_same/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he doesn't get over it, that just shows a lack of maturity on his behalf. \n\n16yos go through these periods of selfishness and entitlement which is only worsened because their mirror is similarly entitled children who don't challenge their bullshit.\n\nStop talking about the car and let him come to you.

You're teaching your kids valuable lessons AND giving them a sizable amount of money. He's very lucky, hopefully he quits sulking soon and realizes that.", "NTA. No, it seems like you're being very fair. I would say that there maybe should have been a conversation about this before you guys went to the dealership.

Yta for thinking your are.", "My wife and I both saved 50 from every paycheck into a cd savings account when we found out we were pregnant with our oldest.", "This. He's a kid, and im sure will survive the embarrassment, and learn a valuable lesson about being thankful. \n\nHe's acting like they're doing 10% of what the are. I got a beater Aveo at 18, my brother could've had a beater but he was smarter with money and got himself a nice impala at 18.", "My first car cost $2k. It had no air con, no airbags, no power steering, no CD player... but I was SO grateful, and I loved that damn car.", "RIGHT?! My first car (in 2001) was a 1990 Chevy Cavalier, two-door, with rusting door panels and a bit of a weird smell. To top it off? It was a manual and I had NO IDEA how to drive it. But it was $500. Mom said if I wanted a car, it was going to have to be this one. \n\nCar was totaled by a manic teen (she really was having a mental health crisis) rear ending me *into* my mom\u2019s driveway in 2003. I still miss that car. \n\nOP, NTA.", "Gonna jump on this comment and add that maybe he's not ready for a car. NTA by the way.", "Oh me too. Cash. I\u2019ll come get it. \ud83d\ude02", "Right? $15k is a 150k+ miles baseline truck price where i live. Sounds like a great deal.", "Me too lol NTA", "> NTA. My brother crap talked me on social media and I paid his phone bill. ~~Guess what happened?~~\n\n\"You won't believe what happened next!\"\n\n\"What happened next will SHOCK you!\"", "We put 100 in per paycheck from when we learned we were having out first into a cd account. Since we kept adding to it and growing it at the same time it helped alot. It also helped that I'm military so I covered most of our expenses and my wife after the kids got into preschool worked fulltime.", "Yes, really. $15k will buy you a nice used car today. Even the kid that didn't do any extra work just gets handed a $15k car. The kid that works extra can get more. I wouldn't say that OP is being fair; he is in fact being VERY generous.", "I explained it to him a couple times the budget. Thats why I'm kind of frustrated.", "My Husband bought a Honda Ridgeline in 2008, it was a 2007 model. In 2021 we bought a Honda Passport only because the engine was going out and it would have cost more to replace the engine than buy a brand new 2021 Honda Passport. That truck had thousands of miles on it, including 4 trips from Indiana to Florida. Hondas are worth the money.", "Agreed. My first car was a 1997 Chevy Cavalier and I got it in 2009. It was around $2k, and I loved that thing. It had great gas mileage to drive to work and college, and it gave me freedom! Isn't that really what teenagers want anyway??\n\nI can't believe how spoiled this kid sounds.", "More second guessing myself because of all the attention it's getting.", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably more about how the youngest reacted\u2026 rather than the TikToks.\n\n* Correct me if I\u2019m wrong OP.", "Because his son being an ungrateful little prick is frustrating\u2026..", "OP stated in another comment that the son was told to look for cars at the $15k range beforehand.", "Why? OP earned and saved the money to buy himself a truck, AND he was willing to spend 15k on a vehicle for a child who did *absolutely nothing* to earn it. There is exactly no reason for a kid to be upset that the vehicle he is getting as a gift isn\u2019t as new or fancy as the truck his dad worked to buy himself.", "The oldest 2 only got 10k when they got their cars. We added 5k for inflation.", "Try reading the post next time. They accounted for inflation.", "Inflation between 2010 and today would only increase that 10k to 13-14k. The kid is actually getting a better deal than his siblings.", "He put in an edit he meant to put 18 y/o not 17.\nThe oldest 2 were gifted 10k and when he talked to them about inflation they agreed with him it would be fair to up the car fund for the younger 2. The younger 2 were both gifted the same amount but the older of those 2 decided to save and work more before buying a car in order to afford a nicer one. The youngest one for some reason has in it in their head that he deserves to be bought a 25k car without saving or working for the rest like his sibling. It wasn't that hard to follow.", "I mean, if the eldest got their car in 2010 ish for 10k, that would be worth just under 14k today. So OP adjusted for inflation appropriately, plus a little extra, by giving the 16 year old 15K. I'd say that's a pretty fair deal. NTA", "What a horrible dad, giving his 16 yr old ONLY a $15k car! What disgusting favoritism!\ud83d\ude44", "THIS. My first car was about $2k also, and I had to pay for half of it.  Drove that damn car into the ground but it was my freedom and I loved it. Even had the roll up windows", "Yeah. I think so too. Maybe if he works and saves for the extra 8k just like his sister did, he will learn the value of money, his new car and maybe stop taking his parents for granted.", "lol. So much effort. OP said what bothers him most is all the crap talking his son is doing on TikTok and it\u2019s getting a lot of attention. Just offering a solution.", "[deleted]", "My husband has a \u201897 Honda civic that still runs well with maintenance. He loves that car", "I think you should little Timmy this situation. Ask a couple of your less well off friends to sit him down for a drive and a talk. Tell him about all the shit they wish they could afford for their kids. \n\nIf your friend snaps and leaves your bratty kid on the side of the road for being a snot, then that's a two for one lesson babey!", "I'm not saying OP doesn't have the right to buy himself a new truck, I'm just saying that sometimes being a parent means handling a moody teenager who's clearly not understanding the situation correctly isn't saying what amounts to \"I'm not buying you a truck but I'm buying me one\". Like obviously adults understand why that's reasonable, but a teenager isn't an adult. I'm not saying OP is an asshole, just that that was the wrong thing to say? You can say the wrong thing and not be an asshole for it.", "I wasn\u2019t clear on that. I\u2019ll stand firm on entitled little shit then. Said with love. Ah. Teenagers!", "Yeah I wished I was given 15k. I was loaned 5k for a down payment, and even then I was extremely grateful for it. I swear sometimes parents try so hard to give their children what they didn't have, they forget to give them what they did, like humility, and appreciation.", "We told him he needs to look at cars 15k and below before we go because the 15k is what the budget is.", "OP very clearly set the expectation: he was willing to spend 15k on a car for his child. The fact that the kid wanted something much more expensive than that isn\u2019t OP\u2019s fault.", "How much clearer could he have been though, honestly?  They specifically told him $15k and under.  If the son had his expectations too high then that\u2019s kind of on him because there was no indication that he should expect a $25k car.", ">He asked me what I would get\n\nI get where you're coming from.  How would you handle this?", "Shit, my parents gave me an extra $800 for a car\u2026that they promptly told me I had to pay them back for \ud83e\udd23", "My parents were originally going to give me a hand me down car, but it took me so long to learn to drive that they sold it before I got it :')\n\n(They sold it for scrap, no harm no foul)", "Ok, so you want to be right. You are right, congratulations. You win. \n\nIs it good? Is this good for you?", "[deleted]", "Personally, probably change the subject to why that my answer isn't relevant?", "You are doubling down on an argument on losing side when facts have been presented and expectations were set at a very specific price point.\n\nSon shouldn\u2019t get mad that he was told a price multiple times and decided to find something over that price. He got his own expectations up for no reason", "It sounds like you want to be right, not OP", "By giving into the sons entitled demands?  That\u2019s not how you fix relationships.  It\u2019s how you destroy the family.", "I would care more about continuing to treat my children fairly and making them understand the consequences of their financial decisions but aight.", "makes sense.  thanks for the reply.", "It seems like this person is a pushover because they would want to be liked by their children no matter what."]}
