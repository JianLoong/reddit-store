I treat my kids the exact same when it comes to finances and earning stuff. The oldest got a phone at 13, so the other kids had to wait until they were 13 to get a phone. You get the gist. \n\n I saved from every paycheck for 16 years to put into the car account. When my oldest turned 16, I divided it by 4, and boom, that was the amount each kid got from me to spend on a car. Any extra was on them. The amount each kid gets to spend on a car is 10k. It'll get you a nice used one, but the catch is you pay for gas by chores or a job after school (insurance is on me and my wife). I can agree that 10 years ago when my oldest bought a car it was a bit of a different market and I asked her and her brother when the 18 yr old was ready to drive if they would be value of the car they got vs the money amount and they both said to make up for inflation to add 5k to each of their car budgets\n\nSo 2 years ago year, my 18 yr old got 15k to spend on a car, now like her older siblings, she was a saver, not a spender, unlike my youngest. Our 17 year old decided last year to put the 10k into a cd savings account for 1 year, worked part time during the school year, worked fulltime on school breaks, saved money doing by chores around the house, saved her birthday money, didn't go out with friends, for Christmas asked for things she needed for school like new shoes instead of games, sold her clothes that don't fit, used her sisters dress for junior prom and pocketed the money, and babysat her cousins ext.  She saved then spent it on a brand new 2023 Honda CRV paid for in cash. (Her reasoning is Hondas last forever, and a CRV is big enough for college moving and stuff) (so overall saved 15k in 2 years) \n\nNow it's our son's turn. On his birthday, he wanted to go to the dealership, and we did. He took us to the truck he wanted a 2020 Chevy. With a 25k price tag. We explained to him that we were not buying him a 25k truck. He said well with inflation from when his siblings bought a car and the 18 yr old getting a brand new car he thought he could get this one. I told him that's not how it worked. Each one of his siblings got 10k, and his sister worked her ass off for the new car. He should pick a 15k car or do what his sister did and save for a new one. He said it's not fair because his siblings get more than him due to the sheer value of the cars alone. I offered if he wanted (I did this with all my kids) I would sell him my car for the 15k (a 2018 ford f250). He asked me what I would get and I said I've been saving for a new truck anyway so I would buy a new truck. He immediately said take me home I don't want to be here. So we did. Now he's speaking out on social media about how the youngest children always get the short end of the stick. \n\nSo reddit AITA for treating my kids exactly the same?\n\nEdit: changed  one 17 to 18 type because of my fat fingers.", "created_utc": 1677544415, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11drvcc/aita_for_treating_my_kids_the_exact_same/", "score": 604, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he doesn't get over it, that just shows a lack of maturity on his behalf. \n\n16yos go through these periods of selfishness and entitlement which is only worsened because their mirror is similarly entitled children who don't challenge their bullshit.\n\nStop talking about the car and let him come to you.

You're teaching your kids valuable lessons AND giving them a sizable amount of money. He's very lucky, hopefully he quits sulking soon and realizes that.", "NTA. No, it seems like you're being very fair. I would say that there maybe should have been a conversation about this before you guys went to the dealership.

You criticized him for being technically right but not clear about the budget before the dealership. As per the post, when it was time for the 18 sister to get the money for her car, OP sat her AND his son down to address the amount. They ALL agreed an additional 5k was fair. OP did exactly what you think he should have done and clearly laid out the amount each child would receive, but you seem dissatisfied and annoyed by it. Why are you asking if he feels good when, even by your own account, he's right and even went about it the right way according to your suggestions?\n\nHis son knows that the oldest kids got 10k and his slightly older sister got the agreed 15k and earned the rest herself through hard work and sacrifice. Now that he is 16, suddenly he feels entitled to a better deal than everyone else got. It's not like he picked something a grand or so over the budget he discussed and agreed to before. He picked something full 10 grand over the budget and sulked when he couldn't get his way. There is no chance this kid could have or should have reasonably believed that he was going to get another 10k over what his sister got just two years earlier. He was trying to pull a fast one over his dad and when he failed to, he went online to whine and cry about it in a final effort to manipulate his father into giving him what he wants because he doesn't want to work for it like the other kids did.\n\nYou're worried about this son, his feelings, and the relationship with OP going further, but what about the other kids who bought within the budget or earned their own money to get the car they really wanted? There would be a lot more hurt feelings and damages relationships if OP gave in. The kid needs to invest and work his ass off for a year just like his sister just did.", "NTA. Your youngest has a huge sense of entitlement. I bought my first car at age 19, with my own savings and some of my dads money. My parents didnt save anything for me, i only got money from my dad because he killed himself when i was 11 and had no will, so his estate was split between me and my brother and unlocked when i turned 18. It was hardly any money at all because he spent it all on drugs.\n\nYour children are privileged and it sounds like the older ones know it, but the youngest is blind to how privileged he is. I would suggest taking away all the things you pay for and making him work for them until he realizes how much you do for him. Hes blasting you on social media because you wont treat him like the prodigal son. Honestly id sit down with him and explain to him that hes committing slander and its illegal too. In a few years he would be able to go to jail for it. He should know that its not okay to slander people online because he didnt get what he wanted.", "NTA. Youngest is.

Let your kid rant on all he wants on TikTok- everyone else will see him for what he is- spoiled!   \n\nIf it were me, I would tell him he get's nothing.  No $10k. And get him a flip phone.  I grew up poor and the only car looked like a car out of the Flinstones- the floor was rusted out you could see the road.  My dad bought it that way.  Then we had a Ford van.

In any other situation, Reddit usually blames the parents for a spoiled kid's actions. There are, of course, some things entirely outside of a parent's control, but it might be useful to consider for a while what you could do to help him grow past his entitlement. (This is coming from a non-parent, as I'm sure is quite obvious.)", "NTA. Your kid was acting incredibly ungrateful. At 19, I got my first car and it was one that my older cousin had already inherited from our grandparents and she had been in multiple major accidents in it. I bought it from my uncle for $200 (in 2001) and I love that thing, even though my mechanic referred to it \"the flaming ball of death.\" My mom had loaned me the $200 for the car and I was so grateful for it.

I was *so overwhelmingly grateful* that they were passing it to me instead of trading it in like usual. I worked my ass off to save for my education and they felt that the car would help me in my efforts. I could always say yes when called in because I would have a way there without having to call around first if my dad was at work. I ended up totalling it in less than a year because someone ran a red light in front of me and I had no time to stop. They gave me the insurance money and I invested it into a GIC with some other savings I had. Seeing me choose to be smart with it, during COVID they purchased me a new vehicle after spending months driving me to my 5AM shifts because public transit doesn\u2019t start that early and it would\u2019ve taken me an hour and a half to walk to work. When my brother finally passed his G and was doing his apprenticeship and working full time they decided he had earned one for himself. They combined the value of the insurance from the first car and the money they had spent on my second. My brother really wanted a truck so he went to them to look and couldn\u2019t find anything in his price range. My brother did some more looking and found a truck that was used and about $14,000 more than what they had given me. He went to them with the listing and his paystubs, and said \u201cthis is what i make, this is what i need to live, if I send you *everything* extra out of my pay for three months I can pay you back all the money over the value of what you gave Dangerous, is that something you would possibly be willing to consider?\u201d. They make all their decisions together so they said let\u2019s go look at it first. They went and looked and it was a deal. Our grandfather haggled and got the price down about 4k. They went home and discussed it, and then went and bought the truck. He\u2019s paid them back. We\u2019re both overwhelmingly aware we would never be in a position to own vehicles as safe and nice as we have without them.
