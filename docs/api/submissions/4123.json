She absolutely should teach her kids that infidelity is unforgivable. For all parties knowingly involved. Especially when no one is even sorry.", "Uh no actually it is. Heard of an emotional affair before? Things may not have escalated to a physical affair but an emotional affair still crosses so many boundaries and for her own SISTER to be the one to have done that to her? I\u2019d never speak to my own sister again if she did something like that to me. OP NTA by a long shot. Protect your peace and protect your children.", "Absolutely, if that's what actually was happening. \n\nIf, on the other hand, she has decided that him helping his sister-in-law hang out the washing is just entirely too familiar, and has, on the basis of that, decided that they must be having an affair...then that's just jumping to the wrong conclusion. \n\nThere's no detail to make a judgement here.", "You still haven't explained what you mean.\n\n\"Acting like a couple\" can be any one of a million things, and you haven't described what actually happened.\n\nI get that you feel like you were betrayed, but have an honest look at what exactly you suspect happened, and then see if there's any evidence of it.", "Seems so.", "OP said they spoke like they were a couple and had pet names for each other. Speaking like a couple sounds very different than speaking like friends or something else innocent like that. My partner and my sister don\u2019t have pet names for each other and I would wager that most other peoples don\u2019t either. At the very least it\u2019s weird and uncomfortable and at the worst it\u2019s an emotional affair that may or may not have gotten physical. Either way their behavior did cross a boundary for OP and at the end of the day they\u2019re the only one who gets to decide how they respond to that. We\u2019re both outsiders on this situation obviously and only have OP\u2019s word to go on here, we\u2019ll never know if we\u2019re getting the whole story or the most accurate telling of events but that\u2019s the part of this sub we deal with as readers and commenters \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it kinda seems like this comes down to you may have different boundaries than OP does and by all means that\u2019s completely okay, it\u2019s your life you decide what\u2019s best for you. It just doesn\u2019t seem entirely fair to say OP overreacted given we don\u2019t know exactly the setup of her relationship with her ex or with her sister"]}
