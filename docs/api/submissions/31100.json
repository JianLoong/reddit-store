Let me tell you something from watching years and years of youth sports (from the sidelines and as an officiator and relative of officiators). The kids don\u2019t really care if they win. They care about spending time with their friends and doing an activity they enjoy.

It\u2019s not fair to anyone. \n\nThe mom is TA for not following the rules and taking her ball and going home when she doesn\u2019t get her way. \n\nThe coach/assistant coach should break up their pairing if the issue is really just carpooling and they aren\u2019t trying to stack the team.
