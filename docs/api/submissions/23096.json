I don\u2019t think keeping score is a productive way to go about it because he just seems like he still won\u2019t care if I\u2019m being honest. You should never have to prove your worth and your contributions to those you love and those who should be your biggest supporters.

WTF? You need to have a serious discussion with your partner. \n\nIt is reasonable for him to prioritize work during his work hours. Just like he would if he worked at an office. During his work hours, you are the primary parent. HOWEVER, outside of his work hours, you and he need to be parenting 50/50. Including nighttime care. \n\nThe same goes for housework - which I assume may also be an issue. Being a stay at home parent to a baby is a full time job.
