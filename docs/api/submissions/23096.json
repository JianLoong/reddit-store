He\u2019s an a**hole in my opinion for not recognizing the work you put in and positioning himself and what he does for the family as superior. That reflects his way of thinking about the world in general, and he is now the father of a daughter. That\u2019s a red flag, and think about how that could impact the ways he raises a daughter, when he seems to not respect women. I don\u2019t think keeping score is a productive way to go about it because he just seems like he still won\u2019t care if I\u2019m being honest. You should never have to prove your worth and your contributions to those you love and those who should be your biggest supporters. I want to say you sound like a great mom, and I know your daughter appreciates you. You shouldn\u2019t have to deal with someone who doesn\u2019t see all that you do for him and his child.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he needs a wake up call to see how much work looking after a baby and house actually is.  \n\nWhy not arrange a day where you go out first thing in the morning and get back in the evening so he gets to experience it all first hand.  He will probably be more understanding after that if he has any sense.", "I would ask him directly : Do you want to raise our child, or should I just file for full custody? Because you are barely parenting **our** child.", "i don't think you'd be an AH for doing this at all, but i think you need to ask yourself what the endgame is here. do you just want to prove to him that he's wrong about the time you spend vs. the time he spends, like a lightbulb moment for him to recognize and appreciate your massive contribution as the sole caretaker? do you want him to realize he doesn't do much with the baby and agree to do more? find out what you want as a result, if it's more than just sticking it to him with facts and being right.", "NTA - He was only with the baby for 4 hours a day when he was on PATERNITY LEAVE? WTF? You need to have a serious discussion with your partner. \n\nIt is reasonable for him to prioritize work during his work hours. Just like he would if he worked at an office. During his work hours, you are the primary parent. HOWEVER, outside of his work hours, you and he need to be parenting 50/50. Including nighttime care. \n\nThe same goes for housework - which I assume may also be an issue. Being a stay at home parent to a baby is a full time job. Yes, you can get some housework done during the day while caring for a baby (depending on their age and whether you are breastfeeding/pumping), but not everything. The housework/cooking that you cannot reasonably get done during his work hours also gets split 50/50.", "NTA. \n\nYou are not the asshole for wanting to track how long your partner takes over your baby. You are trying to show him the reality of your situation and how much work you do as a stay at home mom. \n\n* You are not doing it to shame him or make him feel guilty, but to make him appreciate and respect you more. \n* You are also hoping that he will step up and help you more with the baby and the household chores, and that he will spend more quality time with his child. \n* You are not asking for too much, you are asking for fairness and support.\n\nYour partner is the asshole for not believing you and for not acknowledging your hard...", "NTA but your boyfriend who is not behaving like a partner at all is the AH. Tell him you are going away overnight with your friends or family then leave him to it and see how easy he thinks you have it.", "I think having a conversation about what you'd like to do ahead of time would be the way to go. You're frustrated, and you have every right to be, but I truly think going at this as an objective study would keep emotions from getting heightened.\n\nSomething like, \"we can't seem to agree on who is actually doing what around the house, so I'm planning to keep a log so we have some data to work with. Once that's complete, I'd like to revisit our conversation about childcare and chores.\" Then, there's a book and a card system called Fair Play, and there are tons of videos on TikTok about it. \n\nI'm really hoping that your partner is willing to work with you on this, rather than putting all his efforts into defensiveness.", "NTA, though I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to achieve what you want it to. He knows he\u2019s not helping out with the baby and is trying to guilt you into letting the issue go. \n\nYTA for letting yourself be treated like this. I\u2019m so sorry and you deserve a partner that wants to help raise the child you decided to have together. \nThis is going to be the rest of your life unless you sit down and lay it out for him, you\u2019re exhausted and this is only going to turn into resentment if it hasn\u2019t already.\n\nInfo: What was his upbringing like? Maybe he really does feel like he\u2019s going above and beyond compared to the family life he experienced with his own parents.", "I do not think you would be in the wrong here. I was on the receiving end of a similar situation with my SO. She felt I was not contributing or participating enough in parenting, especially at the new born stage, so she called me out on it and we have since been working on in. However, I am and have always been open minded and open to criticism, but many people are not. But again, you would not be the AH.", "Girl, just leave and get him partial custody. Then you don\u2019t have to track it at all. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like there was any agreement of possibly even any plan on how to raise this child?", "Esh  Now you know he\u2019s very happy to put all the work on you, so you have to be happy to do the same right back at him. Is he working an 8 hour day? Great, so you are on baby duty those 8 hours. The other 8 hours you can be on PC working too. You might be looking for a job or working or researching job types. Those 8 hours he is on baby duty. The last 8 hrs are for sleeping. So you take turns on baby duty, one night his, next night yours.  The person on baby duty is also the one who cooks a meal, cleans, does laundry. Shopping is one person one week during baby duty and the other person the next while on baby duty. Every work time and baby time and household time is split equally. \nFind an online job during your 8 hrs of work time. Or better yet, an 8 hr day job out of the house. Then you won\u2019t let yourself get railroaded by someone who is happy to put all the family and household burden on you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
