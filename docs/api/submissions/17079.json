Like ALL-WAYS.\n\nOn the drive home from one weekend road trip, I said, between now and the next big vacation, (scheduled in 2 months), let\u2019s have a little down-time, so I can catch my breath a bit.

NTA", "NTA.  you are also a human being, with feelings that matter.  i get that you're trying to be supportive, but it feels one sided rather than reciprocated.  i also get that she wants to live her best life, but that doesn't mean she gets to drag you around wherever she goes with no regard for what you think or how you feel.  she really has to consider your feelings as well.  if she doesn't want to, she just needs to find a way to do what she wants to do, without you.    it's been 6 years of this?  i'd be damn tired too.  \n\nhonestly she needs to learn the language so she can be more independent.  imagine how empowered she'll feel, it'll literally set her free and open up her world.  traveling alone can be empowering as well.  you don't have to entertain anyone, or convince anyone to do the things you want to do.  you can literally do whatever you want.  maybe approach her with it this way.  if she still insists on taking you, still encourage her to learn the language, and also ask if you can be a part of the planning, and maybe plan a day or two apart during the trip, so you can each do what you want to do.", "NTA: I absolutely see the pickle you are in and I would encourage you to seek couples clinical support preferably with a clinician or therapist who is a native speaker of the language that your wife speaks.EDIT If you don't already speak the language that she is most comfortable in speaking please do take lessons, her for yours, you for hers.", "OP, you are going to have to put your feet down and refuse to do what you don't want to. You will have to quite plainly tell your wife that you don't like having constant plans and you will not be joining her on every plan she has. She will either find someone else to do those plans with or she will stop planning so much.", "NTA, not everyone can be on the go constantly and many people just need some time to relax, i can understand why your wife is like this though, nearly dying will do that to you, but you need to sit her down and talk to her and make sure she listens because she clearly has not yet. \n\nMaybe get her to try and learn the language so that she can have some independence and not have to rely on you to translate all the time so that she can still go wherever she wants even if you are not up to going and need some rest, couples don't have to go everywhere with each other all the time.", "As someone who has gone through a similar journey (except treatment left me with serious side effects)\u2026I can understand her. Although I decided to take my cue from my incredible, awesome husband once I got to steady state. My husband (and you) was drastically affected by my cancer journey having sacrificed time, priorities, so much.\n\nYou are NTA. Maybe show her this comment?", "NTA. Does she have friends? I get going on vacation with your spouse but why can\u2019t she take some buddies on a hike, etc? I totally see where she\u2019s coming from but I can see yours too. Being a caregiver is HARD and you need a break.", "NAH.\n\n>but I also went thru the roller coaster of her illness,(Not equivalent, I get it.)\n\nWhile not equilivent, you both went through the opposite struggle. While your wife was sick and unable to do anything but worry and get treatment to get better, everything else fell on you. Because she was limited on what she could do, you had to do all of the extra. Taking care of someone who is sick is a full time 24 hour job on its own, then you factor in the regular job your doing to pay for it and it's overwhelming.\n\nShe's trying to make up for the lost last 10 years and that makes perfect sense. What she needs to understand is that you need a period to recover, you have done 20 years worth of work in the last 10.\n\nThis needs to be a serios discussion with a couples therapist  so that she can better see your point of view.", "Having a set & achievable goal is said to be one of 3 foundations to having a successful life. Sounds like your wife has her affairs in order, so to speak.", "NTA.  You deserve a break.", "NTA. I would really encourage you to help your wife find a therapist that she can talk to in her native language. She needs some therapy to help recover from her ordeal: that's why she's doing all these things IMO.", "NAH - It doesn't sound like you are actually discussing things.  You need to give her concrete information - I can only do x every x months.  Can we  decide for the next year that we will compromise and do x every x?\n\nYou need to say for your health you need to have time to destress, let your body and mind recover, and  you can't follow her schedule and will not accept crying, manipulation, etc.  Your health is just as important as hers.", "NAH. Sounds like you both want and need different things right now. And that's ok, it doesn't mean your relationship is broken, it's just something you need to work through together. Maybe seeing a couples councilor would help, especially if you can find someone bi-lingual who has experience with couples who have survived terminal illnesses.", "yes, YTA. can she go with friends?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Now, she wants you to live the life she wants to live. When do you get to have what you need?\n\nShe's being really unfair to you and just doesn't understand. Go to your calendar and block out pockets of time for yourself to be alone, and for down time (no trips or events). Give yourself at least 3 months a year of real down time, and time to be alone. It is time for her to make other friends, and stop making you her only social support. You're exhausted and need some time for yourself. Take it.", "NTA - Your needs matter too and six years after her illness she has no right to call you asshole for wanting a lifestyle that works for both of you. Really solipsistic on her part.", "Yup.  OP does not get to tell his wife that she can't make plans - BUT the wife does not get to tell (or pressure) OP into coming along on those plans.  Introvert clearly needs a break - she needs to do more things solo or with other people.", "Is this even an introvert needing a break thing? OP didn\u2019t seem to indicate he was particularly introverted in his original post. \n\nIt sounds like they have a never-ending stream of plans. Weekdays, weekends, every moment has to be spent \u201cdoing something.\u201d Even my most extroverted friends occasionally need a breather\u2026and for the most part it sounds like OP goes along with the plans, without much complaint. \n\nI understand we are fundamentally agreeing on the same point, dude needs a break, but\u2026shit I feel like anyone would, here. OP didn\u2019t get at this piece of it, so maybe it\u2019s not a consideration here, but I would also imagine there\u2019s some level of financial fatigue of staying this booked and busy at all times.", "NAH. We can all understand wanting to get the most out of life, but resting facilitates that too. Your marriage has been about survival, literally, for 2/3 of its duration. OP, you get to have your needs met too. Sending well wishes and strength.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I didn't have cancer, I have been on dialysis and have had a kidney transplant (2 actually but only 1 transplant during my marriage) with various complications. I have come close to death many times. I am in full agreement with you that you also walked through a major roller coaster. In fact, it has always been my position that it is much harder on the person helplessly watching everything unfold.\n\nWhile I'm sure everyone may not be in agreement with that, I stand by it as both someone who has had serious health complications and have watched my husband walk through his own... It's \"easier\" to be the one with the issue (you know how you feel, how you're doing, and what you can or can't do to help yourself, etc) than watching your spouse struggle while not being able to really help. It's hard to watch them be in pain.\n\nLong-winded way of saying - you have also earned some respite and if that looks like sitting on the couch for a week and doing hardly anything, then that's completely okay. :)\n\nYou didn't tell your wife what she could or couldn't do something... You simply said hey let's do this together instead since I need a little downtime. Perfectly reasonable.\n\nI think it has been stated already but going to counseling may help even if it's just to simply have an objective individual who can help mediate the conversation. It sounds like you are open to her perspective and why she wants to live life 100mph for a while (6 years?!). And that she seems to be struggling to see that you have also walked through a very difficult and trying set of circumstances. From what you've posted here it sounds like she is being insensitive to your needs. Unpopular opinion maybe but having an illness doesn't trump everyone else's experience and needs.", "Lol, sounds like me before I got sick. I have adhd. Difference is, I just went alone\n\nobviously NTA", "Nta, it's great you both do so much together but maybe she should find something for herself. Join a softball league or train for a marathon, anything really.  It's okay for her to have something just for her and that would also give you time for yourself. My husband and I have a few individual things we do and some things we do together.  The balance helps and it also gives us plenty to talk about", "NTA. As long as you aren't stopping her from going it's fine to want a break.", "NTA.\nShe\u2019s coping by doing.\nYou need time to process and rest. \nShe needs to support you in this, just as you have supported her throughout her illness and recovery.\n\nWhat you\u2019re asking isn\u2019t unreasonable.", "You also have needs.\n\nNTA", "NTA. And although what you went through is no where near what she went through, you still had to face losing your spouse which carries it\u2019s own difficulties. And it\u2019s not unreasonable to need a break. You might need someone to act as a mediator to get her to understand your side of this. Someone she trusts who can also understand your feelings in this. Even fun stress can be too much and start reeking havoc with your own health either physically or mentally. Good luck in this!", "NTA.  I understand her wanting to LIVE but you need some downtime. Does she have any friends that can go on her experiences with her? She went through a lot but at some point, she needs to understand that you have needs as well.  It almost seems like she \"plays the cancer card\" when she wants to do something you may not want to do...", "NTA but I am worried your spouse is a bit manic, wanting to live more after such a huge trauma is extremely understandable but after 6 tears they can't even stop for a day?  That's a worrisome sign to me, its important to seize and live life to its fullest but that doesn't mean never stopping and just stare at the sky for a while", "Agree that language lessons should be prioritized, but she should also look into finding a community group that speaks her language. That would give her a bigger pool of people to hang out with besides OP.", "NTA, and the way she's treating you is unacceptable. Did she get psychological support during and after her illness? It sounds like she has some shit she hasn't dealt with yet. Either way, it's not okay for her to treat you like this. She can get some language lessons or some friends and give you a break.", "NTA!! First of all, I understand that what she\u2019s gone through is definitely life changing. Congrats to her for beating her illness like a boss!!! I totally get why she\u2019d want to travel and do what she thinks is making the \u201cmost\u201d of her time. \n\nHowever, making the most of one\u2019s time looks differently for everyone. What she thinks is fun or productive may not be the same for someone else. OP, at the end of the day, you\u2019re your own person and I think you wanting to have some down/chill time is completely valid. You do not need to feel bad in any way for wanting some rest! She needs to be a bit more considerate that because you\u2019re your own person, you won\u2019t want to do everything that she does!", "NTA - Seems your whole world has been focused on your wife by her being deathly sick or completely well. Where in the world did you lose yourself? Don't let her guilt and pressure overrun you. She's a grown ass woman and can take care of herself without you and she needs to learn that. Good luck.", " NTA. She needs to build her life, not tear yours down.", "NTA, she isn\u2019t really either except for the part about not being willing to go alone. Exhaustion is a real thing thing and it sounds like it has gotten to where you\u2019re not enjoying the places you\u2019re going to or the experiences you\u2019re supposed to be enjoying. You need to get a compromise out of her.", "Agree. If we remove the cancer issue, this post is about two people with different approaches. One wants to be go-go-go all the time, the other wants downtime mixed in. That may not be fixable. But I think if you remove the cancer aspect it is a little easier to articulate the issue.", "This is a great perspective, really explains where he's coming from", "I wonder if she needs solo therapy as well, perhaps more than couples right now. I think she needs help processing the fact she was ill for so long, her survival and fear of future reoccurance. Because I suspect that's the problem . She's afraid that if she stops she will loose out, she needs to do it all now just in case.\n\nNAH, op is right to want time to recharge, I think the wife is dealing with a type of PTSD and needs help.", "I absolutely agree with you. I think the wife is almost afraid to take her foot off the gas so to speak\u2014slowing down means having to process and  face a lot of feelings about what she\u2019s been through and probably does not feel secure in her future. She finally has the opportunity to really live and is reveling in making plans and I get it. But I also understand how OP needs downtime. Definitely a NAH situation."]}
