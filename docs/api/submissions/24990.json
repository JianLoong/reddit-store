I created this account now because My words can\u2019t even form because I\u2019m too angry so apologies if I make any  mistake or be all over the place! \n\nMy father(65)was in a relationship with this women 30 odd years ago for 8 years apparently and they haven\u2019t met since their breakup. He was not in relationship for 5 years atleast so he says after the breakup until he met my mum. He few months ago got a message on facebook from that ladys(his \u201cfirst love\u201d) family saying that Diana would like to speak to him because she unfortunately has dementia(her own husband is dead). And apparently she keeps crying and screaming for him. I found this out few months ago when I was using his phone to call our family through facebook. \n\nWhen I asked it what its about he told me everything about it but wanted me to keep it quite because my mum wouldn\u2019t agree. Helpless and feeling for that lady. I agreed but on condition that I\u2019ll go with him and it will ONLY be one time and he promised that he will. The lady stays 3 miles away from us. \n\nThe day we BOTH went they met bla bla bla. I saw my father cry for her. She was hugging him and kissing him and kept calling my dad \u201cdarling, my love, you finally came back to me\u201d  I don\u2019t know how she remembers him but turns out she does. She\u2019s in her early stage. I felt visibly uncomfortable but I let it go because she has dementia what more can I do?\n\nAfter that day he kept missing lunches and dinner every week. It was so frequent I got suspicious. I kind if knew where he was going every week even though he came up with some stupid excuses.One day during family lunch when he was finally with us he kept getting a call on his facebook which he kept declining on our presence during our lunch. When my mum told him to pick it because it might be \u201cimportant\u201d he went outside in the garden and took that call which we both found odd he never did. The call was long so mum mother went upstairs to rest. In that time I knew who he was talking to. So I snatched the call and told Diana\u2019s family to NEVER call us again and they should find a doctor to help her with her mental stage not my dad!\n\nI told my dad I\u2019ll my mum and rest of family and relatives what he\u2019s been doing behind our family\u2019s back. He got angry and said how I was being a horrible person and apparently Diana needs him at this \u201cdifficult\u201d time and how I am being A- hole to someone who has dementia and her family who is suffering from it.\n\nAfter cooling down, I had a think and I feel horrible for saying all that.

If he is hiding then he is cheating.", "NTA \nAnd I honestly don\u2019t understand the ones saying otherwise. \nYour father going once is understandable, but all this sneaking around and hiding it from your mother is cheating( the ex is hugging him, kissing him).\nWhat\u2019s the long term plan here, is he really going to be sneaking around all the time now?! Her family needs to figure out something, her medical condition is being used to have your father there. How is this fair to your mother?!", "If he doesn't find anything wrong with it, then he should have no problem with your entire family finding out what a good Samaritan he is. - NTA", "Info- have you asked your dad how he feels about this person from his past? Have you asked him how he would  feel if your mom was doing this without his knowledge?", "NTA - you tell your dad he has 24 hours to tell your mom or you are going to. The fact he is missing his family lunches and dinners to be with this lady who sadly is going through a tough time but it is not in him to rescue her and make her feel better. It is not his job, his job is to his family, including the wife he is hiding and lying to. I can totally see why you lashed out and they need to know this was 30 years ago and because she got pulled into the past doesn\u2019t mean he and the family have to put up with it. There are thousands of people with dementia going through this and don\u2019t reach out to strangers to help them.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s very sus that your dad feels it\u2019s okay to visit someone he was in love with without your mom knowing. If he was in fact JUST trying to help someone going through a difficult time why not explain that to his wife? It\u2019s also not fair to have you keep that secret from your mom regardless of how you found out or whatever that is on him to be truthful in his marriage. It is also not fair for her family to put him in that situation. Drs offices normally provide support groups and other resources for family members of dementia patients. For them to insert him into that after all these years is also wrong on their part.", "ESH\n\n- Your father should tell your mother. \n- Dementia doesn\u2019t have rules and is outside of her control. \n- You cannot control nor should you control other people.", "NTA. He broke the promise you both made. It\u2019s not his responsibility or obligation to take care of her.", "ESH. Your father sucks for not telling your mother about this, and you suck for lashing out at this woman and her family. They just want their family member to be happy in her time of need and don't know how to handle the situation. It's up to your father to let them down or limit contact if that's what he's going to do. You can't control anyone, and you shouldn't try.", "NTA. Heck, you can tell this story in r/survivinginfidelity thread and everyone will support you. They will roast your dad and potential affair partner though.", "NAH\n\nDementia is a horrible thing but it can also go on for decades.  Unless your dad is planning to leave your mom and be available for his first love all the time, he maybe hurting her more than helping her by going and visiting  and her allowing her to believe they are together. And it most certainly  isnt fair to your mother for him to abandon and deceive her about where he is, who he is talking to.  And if his first love lives another 15-20yrs with progressive dementia, is he going to increasingly abandon your mom and you to be there for someone he loved years ago?\n\nIt is a hard situation because im sure her family is thrilled she has a friend she looks forward to seeing.  And it is horrible to see people with dementia slip in and out of delusion.  \n\nYour dad should tell your mom the truth.  And if he continues to visit her, he should maybe take your mother with him so this pitiful woman will begin to understand he Is married and they arent together. Or he should stop going because the longer he allows her to believe they are a couple he is harming her and building her delusion.", "NTA, although you really shouldn\u2019t have done that to someone with dementia.", "ESH. \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to keep a secret like this for your parent. He needs to talk to your mom about this. And if he\u2019s seeing Diana in a friendly way, it\u2019s probably not a big deal. It\u2019s helping her and giving her some hope. I hope your mom sees it that way too", "Sorry YTA. You are your father's son. Not his wife. The person who should be putting their foot down is your mother.\n\nAnd you should not have gone with him.", "I understand that this is tough for you, but honestly, what's the harm in your Dad being kind to someone he once loved? Really, honestly, where is the harm? He's already doing this without support of his current partner and I don't pretend to know why - i would absolutely support my partner through this, and vice versa, so I can only assume she's very jealous and not terribly kind either?\n\nI'm hesitant to label you TA, but you gotta back off and let him do his thing. This woman isn't going to be around that long, and if it makes her happy to see him, what is the issue?", "YTA\n\nfor even getting involved in that.", "YTA. Firstly, you shouldn't be nosing through your father's messages,these are not your business. Secondly dementia is a horrible disease that robs you and your family of everything (personal and professional experience here), and one of the things is that your memory regresses so Diana may think that she is still with your father. Please do some research here. Thirdly, you should have stayed out of this. Again, none of your business. Lastly, I wonder why your dad has chosen not to speak to your mum about this? Should he? Perhaps from a moral standpoint, but there is clearly a reason he has chosen not to, and yet again, it's none of your business.", "Mmh, that\u2019s actually tough here.\nTo begin with, I feel like you overstepped a little in some situations. You shouldn\u2019t have gone there with him, it was not your place to as it was not your place to pick the call and tell the family what to do with their sick relative.\nNevertheless, your father is keeping a big secret from your mother and he doesn\u2019t realize how this thing could ruin their relationship. He might be helping her, and I personally think he should keep going there and help from time to time, but not as much as it seems he has and with your mother fully acknowledging and accepting it.\nSo, are you the AH, maybe. Just talk to him, tell him that you don\u2019t like to keep a secret to your mother (as you should not, since it is not your place to keep your father\u2019s secrets) and that he needs to understand that if she ever finds out it could end their marriage. Hope I\u2019ve been useful, take care", "You\u2019re blackmailing your father. You lashed out at a family that is struggling. YTA.\n\nYour father may be an AH for not telling his wife. Or it may be a result of a deeper relationship difficulties. \n\nAnd it seems to be a story of keeping something important from one\u2019s past alive while it\u2019s disappearing. And being kind to someone extremely vulnerable. Is it the best thing to do to forcefully finish it?", "ESH- This is probably really complicated and brings up a lot of complex emotions for your dad. Keeping them from his wife is absolutely not the right way to handle that, but I have some compassion here for him because dementia is horrific to witness and you\u2019re never really prepared for that. \n\nYou lashed out at a family who probably has no idea how to handle this and are overly relying on your dad for support. Again. ESH. \n\nI would just talk to your dad and see how he is feeling about this all, acknowledge and validate his feelings that this is probably really complicated but tell him that doesn\u2019t excuse precluding your mom from this, and that he needs to speak to his wife about it and not keep this a secret. \n\nAnd then I would stay out of it. \n\nYour dad is entitled to having complicated feelings about what he\u2019s witnessing. I don\u2019t know and have a hard time believing this is an AFFAIR as such, but he\u2019s going down a reckless path by being too available and keeping it from his wife.", "ESH your father is wrong but you had no right to scream at the family. It's your dad making the mistake. I honestly wouldn't get involved but if you need to tell your mom the whole truth. She may see it differently and she may not.", "YTA. She will\nSoon forget. It\u2019s a small thing to do for a woman losing her mind. My\n Own mother is getting dementia. It\u2019s called short term dementia. They forget the things recently. The past is like today.
