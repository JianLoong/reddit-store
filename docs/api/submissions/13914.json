But I do know that when I was 15, I was a sophomore in high school and one of my best friend's parents were from Bangladesh (she was American and born here). \n\nShe was taken back on a similar trip to visit her family and never returned. I found out much later that she was forced into a marriage at 15 by her family.\n\nFrom what I recall, Bangladesh has high rates of underaged women forced into marriage. OP I would be cautious about going on this trip unless you absolutely know your parents would never do something like that to you. But your dad's comments about how the alternative to a family vacation is you \"running off with a non-muslim boy\" is ringing some warning bells for me.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry if I'm letting my personal experience taint my advice and this is not actually a common thing.\n\nNTA", "I say NTA. This might be an unpopular opinion but I\u2019m getting red flags about your dad\u2019s anger in regards to you becoming \u201cwesternized\u201d and being disobedient. Traveling out of the country and being reliant on your dad when you already seem to have some trust issues is a bit scary. Who\u2019s to say he\u2019ll allow you to come back to your life if it\u2019s one that he disapproves of? \n\nI would say try to compromise and open up to more bonding experiences in your area before agreeing to take a trip like this. But to be clear, only if you want to. You shouldn\u2019t feel forced into bonding with a person just because they\u2019re a blood relative.", "NTA.  Dont go,  there is big chance you wont come back if you go.  He doesnt like being westernized, you are a minor where you are, he can take  your passport if you go.  He can make you marry some one.   His anger is the red flags.\n\nAnd yes this is how one of my classmates got married, just a summer trip home and well took 4 years before she came back   with husband, who she quickly divorced when she was back.", "You're a 14 year old girl, your strict muslim father is worried about you meeting non-muslim boys, and wants to take you on a trip to visit all his family? \n\nIf this isn't raising an entire fleet's worth of forced-marriage red flags, then it should be. Everything about this screams \"danger\" to me. Do not go.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I understand your father's desire that you understand and experience your culture in Bangladesh. However, I would advise caution. I have taught several Muslim students over the years who were taken to Pakistan, in their case, and forcibly married to men they didn't know. With one of my students, it occurred after she got very high marks in all her subjects and expressed a desire to go to university and become a doctor. She came back in September of Gr. 11 wearing a hijab-- which she didn't do before her marriage--  and not being allowed to attend university. The other two students expressed an interest in Muslim boys who were not acceptable to the father in terms of status in the community and the same thing happened. So, be cautious. NOTE: For those of you who think I'm casting aspersions on Islam, I'm not. I also taught Muslim students who did not experience this in high school. I'm mentioning experiences that made me sad, since none of the girls were happy and I couldn't comfort them in any way, except to give them tissues when they cried.", "NTA, it is a huge risk for you to go. Once there, if your father wants to keep you there, he will, and there is nothing that will happen to him. It happens a lot in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.\n\n*edit for correct information.", "NTA\n\ntrust your instincts, you are picking up a vibe and it is warning you.", "NTA. If you\u2019re not comfortable going, don\u2019t go. I can\u2019t help but wonder if your father plans on leaving you there.", "NTA and I definitely would not go just to calm him down.

I would be very scared for your safety if you went.", "Everyone who says you might not come back is right. It\u2019s a real problem. Don\u2019t go.

I\u2019d ask your mom to put a hold on your passport, if he gets you out of the country he may not bring you back. Even if the legal system could make him let you come back you could go through all kinds of trauma first.", "I agree with other commenters that not every vacation to Bangladesh or a similar country results in being married off, however the vacation coupled with her dad\u2019s talk about non Muslim boys and being westernized certainly does raise the possibility OP might not come back. NTA", "NTA. It would be best for you to not go because nothing about this trip will be pleasant. It is more likely to be an exercise in your dad just trying to control you. You're 14. If he's worried about you running off with boys at this age, then boy, it is not going to end well.\n\nYou're a smart girl for avoiding his company. Best to keep it like that.", "NTA\n\n\nDO NOT GO", "NTA, you're 14, that's not a good age for a westernized girl to go to Bangladesh. \n\nI went several times, the last of which at age 13, with only my mother. It was completely different than before, all of a sudden, I couldn't go outside by myself, we couldn't stay anywhere outside a gated community because danger of kidnapping, possible forced marriage, street harassment, that kind of thing. Even going to the mall meant my mom's brother, the only available adult male, had to take time off work to accompany us. Or we could wait til he's off work. It was completely ridiculous and I hated it. But also, I understood the danger was real - Bangladesh is a scary place. \n\nIt honestly doesn't sound like you have a good enough relationship with your dad to go to Bangladesh with him. As a young girl, and his daughter, he has 100% control of you there. If he's yelling at you already for becoming westernized, do you really trust him to protect you from creeps? Or will he basically tell you it's your fault for not wearing a burqa?", "I would say your NTA because going to a foreign country where you don't know anyone or the language is not ideal. You also do not know how safe it is.  I am not going to assume (like many people here) that he is going to marry you off just because he is muslim. You know him better than anyone on here, if you think there is a chance that he may do this, then do not go.", "I\u2019d strongly advise you not to go, hun. I don\u2019t know how religious your dad is but there\u2019s a number of things that would make me weary, personally. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for being you. So what if youre Westernised? Lots of people in Bangladesh to carry on the traditions.", "NTA --- Be very weary if he isn't planning to marry you off then there could also be a chance that he's planning an honour killing either way you don't go home to your mother.", "NTA. \nDo not take this trip. I'm not trying to sound stereotypical but anything could happen there and be a risk and your mom won't be there to save you in any way.", "NTA\n\ndo not go. if you are forced, stick a spoon in your pants so you will get pulled aside at security and you can tell them your concerns. You are old enough to decide where you are comfortable travelling to.\n\nYour dad gives off many red flags - many people on here saying \"forced marrige/abduction\" is NoT tHaT CoMmOn\" are idiots in the sense that they are comparing moderate non-red flag behaviour of some other people  that are irrelevant to your dad's behaviour.\n\n\nYou can connect with Bengali culture anywhere - internet exists and community groups are numerous. \n\nNTA", "NTA don't do it, dude.  Does your mom know?", "I would not go, op. Your father might have a 'husband' in mind for you.", "NTA at all. Women in that part of the world and that belief system are often treated like property, not humans. Don\u2019t give an inch.\n\nYou should absolutely be westernized. That\u2019s another way of saying you\u2019re valued as an intelligent, capable and independent human being.\n\nPlease don\u2019t go there and don\u2019t let your father push any beliefs or customs or values on you. As a minor and a woman, it\u2019s very possible that you will have no control if you do. No say in what happens to you, where you go, who you\u2019re with. You could become little more than a slave.\n\nIf he can\u2019t handle being told no about this and needs to be \u201ccalmed down,\u201d he cannot be trusted with your dignity, safety, and autonomy.
