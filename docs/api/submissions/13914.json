But I do know that when I was 15, I was a sophomore in high school and one of my best friend's parents were from Bangladesh (she was American and born here). \n\nShe was taken back on a similar trip to visit her family and never returned. I found out much later that she was forced into a marriage at 15 by her family.\n\nFrom what I recall, Bangladesh has high rates of underaged women forced into marriage. OP I would be cautious about going on this trip unless you absolutely know your parents would never do something like that to you. But your dad's comments about how the alternative to a family vacation is you \"running off with a non-muslim boy\" is ringing some warning bells for me.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry if I'm letting my personal experience taint my advice and this is not actually a common thing.\n\nNTA", "I say NTA. This might be an unpopular opinion but I\u2019m getting red flags about your dad\u2019s anger in regards to you becoming \u201cwesternized\u201d and being disobedient. Traveling out of the country and being reliant on your dad when you already seem to have some trust issues is a bit scary. Who\u2019s to say he\u2019ll allow you to come back to your life if it\u2019s one that he disapproves of? \n\nI would say try to compromise and open up to more bonding experiences in your area before agreeing to take a trip like this. But to be clear, only if you want to. You shouldn\u2019t feel forced into bonding with a person just because they\u2019re a blood relative.", "NTA.  Dont go,  there is big chance you wont come back if you go.  He doesnt like being westernized, you are a minor where you are, he can take  your passport if you go.  He can make you marry some one.   His anger is the red flags.\n\nAnd yes this is how one of my classmates got married, just a summer trip home and well took 4 years before she came back   with husband, who she quickly divorced when she was back.", "You're a 14 year old girl, your strict muslim father is worried about you meeting non-muslim boys, and wants to take you on a trip to visit all his family? \n\nIf this isn't raising an entire fleet's worth of forced-marriage red flags, then it should be. Everything about this screams \"danger\" to me. Do not go.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I understand your father's desire that you understand and experience your culture in Bangladesh. However, I would advise caution. I have taught several Muslim students over the years who were taken to Pakistan, in their case, and forcibly married to men they didn't know. With one of my students, it occurred after she got very high marks in all her subjects and expressed a desire to go to university and become a doctor. She came back in September of Gr. 11 wearing a hijab-- which she didn't do before her marriage--  and not being allowed to attend university. The other two students expressed an interest in Muslim boys who were not acceptable to the father in terms of status in the community and the same thing happened. So, be cautious. NOTE: For those of you who think I'm casting aspersions on Islam, I'm not. I also taught Muslim students who did not experience this in high school. I'm mentioning experiences that made me sad, since none of the girls were happy and I couldn't comfort them in any way, except to give them tissues when they cried.", "NTA, it is a huge risk for you to go. Once there, if your father wants to keep you there, he will, and there is nothing that will happen to him. It happens a lot in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.\n\n*edit for correct information.", "NTA\n\ntrust your instincts, you are picking up a vibe and it is warning you.", "NTA. If you\u2019re not comfortable going, don\u2019t go. I can\u2019t help but wonder if your father plans on leaving you there.", "NTA and I definitely would not go just to calm him down.

I would be very scared for your safety if you went.", "Everyone who says you might not come back is right. It\u2019s a real problem. Don\u2019t go.

I\u2019d ask your mom to put a hold on your passport, if he gets you out of the country he may not bring you back. Even if the legal system could make him let you come back you could go through all kinds of trauma first.", "I agree with other commenters that not every vacation to Bangladesh or a similar country results in being married off, however the vacation coupled with her dad\u2019s talk about non Muslim boys and being westernized certainly does raise the possibility OP might not come back. NTA", "NTA. It would be best for you to not go because nothing about this trip will be pleasant. It is more likely to be an exercise in your dad just trying to control you. You're 14. If he's worried about you running off with boys at this age, then boy, it is not going to end well.\n\nYou're a smart girl for avoiding his company. Best to keep it like that.", "NTA\n\n\nDO NOT GO", "NTA, you're 14, that's not a good age for a westernized girl to go to Bangladesh. \n\nI went several times, the last of which at age 13, with only my mother. It was completely different than before, all of a sudden, I couldn't go outside by myself, we couldn't stay anywhere outside a gated community because danger of kidnapping, possible forced marriage, street harassment, that kind of thing. Even going to the mall meant my mom's brother, the only available adult male, had to take time off work to accompany us. Or we could wait til he's off work. It was completely ridiculous and I hated it. But also, I understood the danger was real - Bangladesh is a scary place. \n\nIt honestly doesn't sound like you have a good enough relationship with your dad to go to Bangladesh with him. As a young girl, and his daughter, he has 100% control of you there. If he's yelling at you already for becoming westernized, do you really trust him to protect you from creeps? Or will he basically tell you it's your fault for not wearing a burqa?", "I would say your NTA because going to a foreign country where you don't know anyone or the language is not ideal. You also do not know how safe it is.  I am not going to assume (like many people here) that he is going to marry you off just because he is muslim. You know him better than anyone on here, if you think there is a chance that he may do this, then do not go.", "I\u2019d strongly advise you not to go, hun. I don\u2019t know how religious your dad is but there\u2019s a number of things that would make me weary, personally. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for being you. So what if youre Westernised? Lots of people in Bangladesh to carry on the traditions.", "NTA --- Be very weary if he isn't planning to marry you off then there could also be a chance that he's planning an honour killing either way you don't go home to your mother.", "NTA. \nDo not take this trip. I'm not trying to sound stereotypical but anything could happen there and be a risk and your mom won't be there to save you in any way.", "NTA\n\ndo not go. if you are forced, stick a spoon in your pants so you will get pulled aside at security and you can tell them your concerns. You are old enough to decide where you are comfortable travelling to.\n\nYour dad gives off many red flags - many people on here saying \"forced marrige/abduction\" is NoT tHaT CoMmOn\" are idiots in the sense that they are comparing moderate non-red flag behaviour of some other people  that are irrelevant to your dad's behaviour.\n\n\nYou can connect with Bengali culture anywhere - internet exists and community groups are numerous. \n\nNTA", "NTA don't do it, dude.  Does your mom know?", "I would not go, op. Your father might have a 'husband' in mind for you.", "NTA at all. Women in that part of the world and that belief system are often treated like property, not humans. Don\u2019t give an inch.\n\nYou should absolutely be westernized.

As a minor and a woman, it\u2019s very possible that you will have no control if you do. No say in what happens to you, where you go, who you\u2019re with. You could become little more than a slave.\n\nIf he can\u2019t handle being told no about this and needs to be \u201ccalmed down,\u201d he cannot be trusted with your dignity, safety, and autonomy.

Why does he care about that? That means he most probably has something unpleasant arranged there, and is resentful that you would not accept his arrangement. Involve the CPS if things get too far.", "NTA. ***You need to keep a metal tea spoon in your underwear****.* If you all the sudden find yourself in the airport against your will, the security staff will be your last exit. You will trigger the metal detector, and theyt will take you away. Explain to the security that you are taken abroard against your will.", "DO NOT GO WITH YOUR ABUSIVE FATHER TO A FOREIGN COUNTY KNOWN FOR CHILD MARRIAGE\n\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE", "NTA. Do. Not. Go. This screams forced marriage and you should trust your gut. As well as making every attempt to get out/get emancipated ASAP.", "NTA. Ask your mother what to do if suddenly your father married you off without your consent.", "Do not go!", "Wow, NTA, this scenario is giving major human trafficking/forced marriage vibes, please don't go with your father", "Obedience isn't a healthy quality in family dynamics. As soon as someone asks you to be obedient, run.\n\nNTA, and please stay safe.", "NTA - And I have to say this potential insistence on going to Bangladesh with just your strict anti-westernisation father is very worrying. Is it possible he might be taking you back to get married?  In our country we now even have specific police units set up to prevent young girls from strict muslim (and hindu but mostly muslim) families being taken back to bangladesh , pakistan, india and other parts of the the world and forced in to arranged marriages - as it is such a problem. not saying this is the issue here but it really does happen - and it is very very difficult to recover from and is extremely traumatic.", "Oh hon don\u2019t you go anywhere with that guy. Take it from one desi to another- you might not come back.\nNTA \nEDITED for judgement", "NTA. You owe your father nothing. Your life is YOURS not his; spend it with people who support YOU.", "do not go, there is every probability it is a ruse to take you from your mum.", "Please do not go, even I reading this got a bad feeling", "Tell him you'll go with him when you're an adult. That you have studying to do now. If that sets him off, you'll know he wants you to get married instead of getting an education. My mom's dad was like this. He was not a nice man. In the meantime, get to know some family there like your cousins and aunts so when you're feeling safe enough to travel you will have your own contacts and network. My father is no longer healthy enough to travel to India and I regret not spending more time in Kolkata. I feel like something is missing. I'm 45F never married and no kids and zero regrets because my life is amazing but I wish I could come and go from India more freely without relying on family to visit.", "While I was living in UK, I\u2019ve heard my share of horror stories from the  students: their classmate goes on a \u201cfamily trip\u201d to the ancestral country, only to get promptly married off, and left there.\n\nOP, please let teacher/people outside the family about your father\u2019s intentions. You might be at risk.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nAllah guide your father because that's messed up. The fact that he brought up running off with a non-muslim boy got me concerned. You're 14. I know Bangladesh (and a lot of other desi countries) enforce young marriages, even if forced marriages are haram. It is your choice who you stay with. I understand that as a father he might be hurt that you don't want to stay with him but come on he's telling you to leave and go to a country (a country with far worse conditions mind you) with him and is threatening/bashing you for denying him.", "I didn't thought of this but it remembered me that one of my classmates (16F) didn't returned from her vacations. Her father who lived in his home country called her and said he is in an hospital, so she flew in his country. And got caught in his house, he wanted to marry her to someone and her mother (who stayed in Germany) had to contact the police and it was a very big complicated thing to bring her back home.", "I had the same thought. Bangladesh is not Iran, but equally the Bangladeshis I know are heavily westernised and while they would never do this to their teenage daughters, there are more orthodox Muslims there too.", "This was my first thought - parental abduction.", "Damn, this comment gave me chills.", "My family is Bangladeshi. Though this isn\u2019t exactly common, it\u2019s certainly not unheard of. That\u2019s the vibe I get from this as well. \n\nReligious assholes will unrelentingly asshole, as if they can\u2019t help themselves. OP, I\u2019m not comfortable with you being alone with your father.", "Never say never baby. \n\nFanatics can act that way when you less expect it. And your das is pretty much acting like one. Be careful.", "They probably didn't think their father would either.", "Do you think victims of honor killings thought their parents would do it? Humans are not as predictable as you might like to believe. That said, I'm glad you aren't going.

I didn\u2019t read the post all the way through and instantly judged this kid for being on Reddit. After reading the post however, I tried to find this comment so I could edit it. Turns out that\u2019s harder than I thought after leaving the post.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely fine for op to be here, my main concern is teenage girl on Reddit being subjected to awful people. Anyway, op isn\u2019t the AH, obviously. Her dad is being intolerant and insufferable.", "I read a post where if the girl feels threatened and her father is forcing her, she should put something metal in her underwear so she sets off the metal detector and draws attention to herself.
