It was only me and Joey in the house so I asked him if he knew what happened to the money.\n\nHe said no.

Both of them said no. This was all becoming really odd and I was even thinking maybe I misplaced it.\n\nI asked Ashley if she knew what happened to the $40 and if she'd seen it, as I was thinking I must've left it somewhere in the house. She said no but pointed out that Joey was acting strange, and asked me if maybe he took it. I was pretty flabbergasted that she'd say that but she wasn't wrong, Joey was acting weird.\n\nWell, it turns out that Joey was acting strange and guilty because he had bought vapes off a kid from school and was using them in his room, and apparently Ryan noticed his room smelled fruity and Joey was worried he was going to get caught. \n\nWe're dealing with that, but it's a separate issue.\n\nYesterday, I caught Ashley red-handed.

She cried more and said that her pay check was late from work and that she needed some money to put in Christmas cards.\n\nI'm not inclined to believe this because Ashley lied to me when I asked her before about the money, and I'm extremely furious that she tried to pin this on Joey.\n\nI told Ryan what happened and I said that his wife is no longer welcome in my house. Ryan tried to defend her and says that Ashley has a personality disorder and doesn't mean to be this way and it's only $40 plus she tried to pay me back. \n\nI told him that's irrelevant and that I don't want someone who I can't trust in my home.\n\nRyan and Ashley left last night.

However, lots of people on here are so quick to say just cut the son and his wife out of your life, but do you really want that? I think it's entirely fair to have an uncomfortable discussion with the both of them, and maybe don't let them stay there alone/establish boundaries and giver her a chance to earn your trust again. I only say this because thief or not, assuming you want any kind relationship with your son, you're going to at least have to attempt to get past this at some point. I had a friend take $100 from me in HS (gym class). He eventually fessed up and paid me back and we got over it. I maybe never trusted him like I did before, but we still remained friends.

It sounds like she's in regret and he's in denial. I'm assuming they're not truly hard up for money. If so, you can offer to help to the best of your ability. Not by giving them cash, but by helping figure out why such a small amount of money became a theft and a sensitive issue.\n\nYour son's the asshole if he can't be an adult and figure out what's going on so he can respond to you you. But give them some time. If she has incurable kleptomania, then sure, ban her indefinitely, but it sounds like she needs help. When you re-establish contact with your son, make it clear that she wasn't banned over $40, as you'd be there to help them as best you could if they had money problems. She was banned for behavior. It sounds like she needs therapy. No need to jump into \"get her fixed, divorce her, or never visit again.\" Just give it some time so he can try to sort out what's wrong.

Yes.  Was Ashley unambiguously in the wrong?  Also yes.  Does the amount not really matter here - it's more about the principle of the thing?  Also yes!

I don't know what you were expecting.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd hey, maybe you're cool with that!  A lot of people on here seem to think that never allowing a thief in your house again is a solid reason to break contact forever with one of your children.  I dunno.  She's still gonna be a thief forever - no amount of therapy changes something like that.  Let her back in and she will take your jewelry.  But she's also gonna be your son's wife, and you've only got the two sons.  Sometimes life gives us messy choices to make.

So let's forget about the \"payback\" things for a bit here.\n\nPeople are so focused on the \"payback\" but forget about stealing. Stealing is stealing, and trust is lost. You don't get to defend stealing with \"payback later\". As far as I know, I can say she tried to steal more, isn't it logical? It is not an overreaction from OP.\n\nAlso, why did she not speak up? Like \"Can I borrow $40?\" Why did she not tell her husband? Why did she not borrow from her husband? Why did she not confess the first time she was asked? There are too many steps that can make this better. She stope and then was caught when she put her hand on the purse again.

She would have kept lying and not apologized had she not gotten caught.\n\nIf a MIL was caught rifling through her DIL\u2019s purse after stealing, lying, and trying to get a kid in trouble everyone would say that the son needs to cut his mom out of his life completely.

Why does OP have to put up with letting a thief take whatever she wants because her son has bad taste in women?", "I like your way of thinking, also the one who instigate the cntact cutting (and also the theiving), is not OP; it was the son. The ball is in their court. Is it the hill **they** want to die on?", "Exactly this. And it's for that reason you banned her, not for the money but the fact she stole from you, tried to put the blame on an innocent party, and destroyed what little trust she had built with you.

I wouldn't want her in my house at all.  But I would probably want a relationship with my children - and cutting one spouse out of your life typically means you lose your relationship with both spouses.  It is unreasonable to expect otherwise.\n\nPeople in this thread are being much too glib about OP ending her relationship with her son over a supposed matter of principle. That, or they are being unrealistic about the possibility of OP maintaining a good relationship with her son and grandkids while banning her DIL from the house.\n\nMaybe a relationship with your son and eventual grandkids is worth a few thousand dollars in missing necklaces over the years... maybe not.  But the value proposition here is not cut and dry.", "It's one thing for OP to say she takes a strict stand on theft and therefore doesn't want anything to do with her son anymore.\n\nBut I don't find it sympathetic that she is acting surprised that her son has very reasonably cut off contact with her.

Letting her daughter-in-law back into her home doesn't mean she has to accept lying or theft, at home or elsewhere. \n\n Again, this should also involve a hard conversation. OP doesn't need to apologize or become a pushover. But she can forgive. Let her DIL know that she is allowed back in the house as family, and that her trust has been broken and it will take time and effort to rebuild."]}
