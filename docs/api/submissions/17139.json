He said if she wanted the dessert, then to get it and if she didn't want it, he'd get his. He wasn't making her choose between the two. Also, y'all don't know what their budget actually is. Maybe $300 something is their budget and the dessert fell within that range. Also, she axed 4 other places already, so offerering her a dessert he knew she'd like (to make her happy because she obviously wasn't bc of the amount of paces they already went) that was within their range was a better move. She seems difficult to please, so her getting upset over a dessert she'd like is ridiculous, and no, he wasn't putting the pressure on her or was making her choose a crap dessert.
