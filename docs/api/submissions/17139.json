What's an extra twenty five for dessert?", "YTA Clearly you're not watching the budget that much if you'd already spent $300+ dollars on ONE DINNER. Even if it was about the money, I'm guessing the dessert you wanted couldn't have been that much less.", "Okay, so you guys spent $300+ on drinks and dinner (ignoring your budget), you see one of your wife's favorite desserts on the menu, and then tell her to choose between a dessert she likes vs something you like, and mention the budget.. YTA", "How is getting drinks, dinner & dessert watching the budget? That was a lame excuse to not buy 2 desserts. \n\nYTA", ">Update: The reason we had spent $300 was because we had stopped for drinks/apps at 4 places prior but moved on because she was not happy with the food, service, drink selection or ambiance. I was trying to accommodate her.\n\nI think you guys have more problems than budgeting for food.", "YTA. Discuss budgeting at home, not like you're doing any favors by telling her you are budgeting dessert. If you were actually budgeting, you wouldn't go to a restaurant that serves dessert that expensive in the first place. It is rude to because you made it sound like this one thing she likes would break the budget.", "ESH I guess. I have no idea how this is a fight.", "ESH. Grown adults fighting over *checks notes* dessert? Come on man.", "NTA after reading the info in the update: the wife nixed FOUR restaurants already that night. She sounds impossible to please.", "YTA", "Must be nice to think 300+ is staying on budget\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.

ESH.", "Mostly NTA - She seemed to go off the deep end for something i would consider fairly nice and generous, though the budget comment at the end was a little bit of AH", "NTA you gave her a choice between the two - why is she so angry about this? It\u2019s not like you said you have to have your dessert you gave her the choice. To get so angry about this is ridiculous \n\nBut yeah like what\u2019s $25 when you spent $300. However once again - you simply gave a choice. Hopefully your tone was even keel", "YTA It was rude of you to make her choose. If you thought she would choose her favourite dessert, why not just pick the cheaper one for yourself if it mattered to you? Why put it all on her? If you weren't sure what she would pick, just have her ordered first and respond accordingly.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nIf you\u2019ve already spent $300 on the evening, will an additional $5-10 (the presumed difference between the expensive desert and a different option) really make a difference?

You\u2019re both assholes.", "Idk how y'all do it, but eating out once a week doesn't generally count as budget spending when you go to 5 restaurants in a night.

You essentially told her \u201cyou can have the dessert you want or I can get what I want and we can stay on budget.\u201d And when you\u2019ve already blown $300 on dinner, may as well spring for the dessert she really loves and it hard to find.", "This exactly. Yta. \"Well honey we've spent 300 but *as long as you're careful about dessert* we'll stay on budget.\" For goodness sake. You're clearly both indulging together so don't put it on her to stay on a budget you've both broken.", "I understood it was rather: have this $25 dessert if you fancy it. If you don't, I'll have this other one I fancy. I feel we should not spend more that this amount but I am prioritizing your wish, and only if you don't want it I will have mine.\n\nIf this is true, NTA.", "As in EQ problems", "Even with this train of thought he's putting the onus of staying within budget on his wife. If you've already spent $300 on food/drink and the price difference for a dessert is $10 then there's no reasonable reason to even mention the budget\n\nIf he was concerned about budget that conversation should been midway through the meal, not \"well if you want to break the budget on dessert we can do that, dear.\"", "That\u2019s still an uncomfortable position to put her in. \u201cI\u2019ll get this dessert I like, but only if you don\u2019t get the one you like, because we can\u2019t do both.\u201d That\u2019s manipulative. Even if unintentionally.", "No, he isn't. \n\nIf his train of thought is \"we already spent too much, we can afford 25 more but not 50, so it is just one dessert. You have it if you want it, if you don't, I will\", how is he putting the onus on her? They will spend 25 more regardless, and she has dibs on that.", "I do not see it like this. It of course depends on the circumstances but if he really means it as giving her the priority (and not be bitter afterwards if she does decide to have it), where is the manipulation?", "Because he told her upfront that he\u2019d only get the dessert he likes if she doesn\u2019t get the one she likes. She knows she\u2019s denying him his choice if she chooses her own. He could have just as easily suggested she get her favorite dessert and *then,* if she declined, ordered his.", "What's the difference though? It is HIS choice to not get his dessert if she has hers. Not her problem.", "Because he made *her* decide whether or not he gets dessert. If you can\u2019t understand the difference between telling her upfront that he won\u2019t get his dessert if she gets hers, or just quietly doing that without announcing his little act of martyrdom, I don\u2019t know of any better way to explain it to you.", "You do not need to explain it to me, I understand where you are coming from.\n\nI am perhaps less sensitive to emotional blackmail though, because I tend to take things at their face value. If he told me to pick the dessert first, I would if I wanted it, I wouldn't if I didn't, and would not feel guilty either way because it would be HIS decision not to have one if I do."]}
