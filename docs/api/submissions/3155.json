Seriously modern birds get larger younger and actually cook much more quickly than traditional timing would have you expect. Depending on temperature it may well be done.

A bronze will cook faster than a white normally. Was it a cock or hen bird that also makes a difference.\n\nI know that if I have to cook a fresh turkey they take less time now than they used to.\n\nCheck the thigh meat or the cavity juices. Just stick a knife into the fattest part of the thigh stick it in deeply and press against the meat and check the juices run clear or cut the thigh off at the joint and check there. If the juices are blood free it's done. A good clue as to when it is cooked is are the legs standing away from the bird like it's trying to air it's armpits. OH that is another thing was it cooked strings on or off?\n\nI would be more concerned about the stuffing but again has she stuffed the cavity or the breast and  has she used a meat or vegetable stuffing and how stuffed is it.\n\nBest bet next year/time invest in a meat probe. MIL may actually have one already.\n\nOther things to consider is you MIL a cook or some who cooks food, has your 50 year old mother in law cooked a turkey every year for the last 30 years?
