It is the capybara of colours.\n\nAlso mauve is purple making yellow a complementary colour so yellower or olive skins or blonde hair really pop. What will not sit brilliantly with mauve is an orangey fake tan. Ginger hair has undertones and highlights and if you are stronger on the ones that come up \u2018orange\u2019 rather than copper or auburn, mixing two shades of orange and purple (hair, skin, dress) will not make you blend in. It will look like the van from Scooby Doo.\n\nFirst month of my first job as a make up artist the manager insisted we all get professional St Tropez tans at the spa downstairs as part of their training and so we could upsell it. This was when it was very new as a brand and a concept and I expressed a hard no that tanning of any kind really does not suit my skin or hair. I was built to look like I have not seen sunlight.\n\n\u2018No no, it adapts to your skin. It cannot come too dark, we have magical sales speak.\u2019 I have to make rent so paper knickers it is. I came into work the next day and the manager sent me home. I was as I warned the shade of a carrot with jaundice. No golden glow. I was Sunny D 90s version.\n\nAnd yes, even with the professional body scrub at the spa and a pot of Fresh brown sugar scrub to take home to really date this to the early 2000s, it took ten damn days to get back to normal because pale skin seems to hold fake tan like a dog with a bone. They had to pay me not to work it was so brand damaging. I was mortified. People in London noticed and they notice nothing. I looked like fried chicken.\n\nI do not tan. And I am pale but pasty is in the eye of the beholder. Tans are subjective too. Donatella Versace looks like she lives in a gingerbread house. Other people look spectacular with a tan. \n\nAlso if she\u2019s had your make up matched and trialled to your natural skin then the spray tan is going to bugger that right up. But she\u2019s going to be pissed off either way because a lot of people seem to think you are being pale to spite them. It\u2019s baffling to me. NTA.

Spray tans do look weird on certain skin tones and it sounds like yours is one of them.  My skin/hair coloring looks fine with a spray tan but those things can go BAD, oh so very bad!  I tried two \"trial run\" spray tans before my own wedding, several months (thankfully!) ahead of the wedding. Practice Tan #1 was fine - nice color, even, and it faded at a mostly even rate.  Awesome, right?!?  Then I did Practice Tan #2.  Same place, same spray tan booth, same choice of shade, etc.  EPIC FAIL!  I looked like an Oompa Loompa.  My feet and lower legs were  orange. Literally Orange!  And one shoulder was spotty, and one arm was lighter than the other.  \n\nSpray tans are never to be forced upon an unwilling victim.

You can relax and have fun, then!", "NTA. I'm a fellow ginger. Your sister's command is dumb. And spray tan is not like hair, makeup, or a dress: you can't take it off at the end of the day. That's too much.", "NTA my general rule of thumb when it comes to weddings is that if the look can't be changed in 24 hours then it's most likely a ridiculous request. So, stuff like make up, hair styles, dresses, etc. are fine for the bride/groom to dictate *to an extent*. Expecting someone to get a tan, lose or gain weight, dye/cut/grow their hair out, and the like just for someone else's wedding isn't cool.", "IDK if this whole thing of making your friends and family change their looks for your wedding is a recent trend or just something I've been lucky enough to not be exposed to in my life, but I think it's absolutely bonkers and no one should be forced to go along with it.
