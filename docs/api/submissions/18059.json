It is the capybara of colours.\n\nAlso mauve is purple making yellow a complementary colour so yellower or olive skins or blonde hair really pop. What will not sit brilliantly with mauve is an orangey fake tan. Ginger hair has undertones and highlights and if you are stronger on the ones that come up \u2018orange\u2019 rather than copper or auburn, mixing two shades of orange and purple (hair, skin, dress) will not make you blend in. It will look like the van from Scooby Doo.\n\nFirst month of my first job as a make up artist the manager insisted we all get professional St Tropez tans at the spa downstairs as part of their training and so we could upsell it. This was when it was very new as a brand and a concept and I expressed a hard no that tanning of any kind really does not suit my skin or hair. I was built to look like I have not seen sunlight.\n\n\u2018No no, it adapts to your skin. It cannot come too dark, we have magical sales speak.\u2019 I have to make rent so paper knickers it is. I came into work the next day and the manager sent me home. I was as I warned the shade of a carrot with jaundice. No golden glow. I was Sunny D 90s version.\n\nAnd yes, even with the professional body scrub at the spa and a pot of Fresh brown sugar scrub to take home to really date this to the early 2000s, it took ten damn days to get back to normal because pale skin seems to hold fake tan like a dog with a bone. They had to pay me not to work it was so brand damaging. I was mortified. People in London noticed and they notice nothing. I looked like fried chicken.\n\nI do not tan. And I am pale but pasty is in the eye of the beholder. Tans are subjective too. Donatella Versace looks like she lives in a gingerbread house. Other people look spectacular with a tan. \n\nAlso if she\u2019s had your make up matched and trialled to your natural skin then the spray tan is going to bugger that right up. But she\u2019s going to be pissed off either way because a lot of people seem to think you are being pale to spite them. It\u2019s baffling to me. NTA. You\u2019re honestly helping her out not doing it\u2026.", "Mauve is a great color with super white skin and ginger hair! NTA. Rock your natural beauty.", "How does that work with your ginger hair.  My God daughter is a ginger and hard to find anything in pinks/red for her to wear without looking really strange.", "[removed]", "Exactly. She's not interested in them as people.", "Keep a close eye on your hair products.  Hair bleach in the mix.", "Hand her a can of spray tan and say, \"You can invite this can, or you can invite me.  Your choice.\"", "Agreed. I was expecting a more tropical color but mauve (or least the color I'm envisioning) seems totally fine for fair skin. Especially with complementary make up colors.", "Mauve is more purple with grey undertones, so it looks great on redheads.", "I hope you don't talk to those nasty people anymore", "You posted this 4 times fyi", "Happy Cake Day", "Exactly plus no one is looking at a bridesmaid n going \"she's too pale for that colour. Well that's the whole wedding ruined best let the bride know she failed to have adequately tanned bridesmaid and will no longer associate with her\"", "Thanks!"]}
