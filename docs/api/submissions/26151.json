There might be multiple reasons why they decided to move in with you more full time. Either way I think you need to have a sit down with them and talk in clear and adult terms what is happening. And importantly make sure both sides take the time to listen to each other and not talk over each other. If they have grievances hear them out fully, do not diminish what they feel with things like \"but it happened a long time ago\". Comfort them saying that Caleb will never replace them. And that whilst their pain is real, and what their mother did was wrong (if Caleb did not bully/abuse them) but that is more on their mother and her own issues and insecurities. Another thing you can do is offer to go to family counseling and have the discussion their with a neutral third party involved.

Another thing I didn't consider, is there possibly more to the story concerning Caleb, especially given the extreme reactions?

We were similar ages as your daughters. It\u2019s my mom\u2019s house and she can do what she wants with it, I think the main issue is that we were all at \u201cadjustment\u201d ages and it felt like by not asking us for our opinion or input, like we were truly \u201cout on our own\u201d and that her house was not \u201cours,\u201d because if it was \u201cours\u201d she would have asked our opinion, right? Even if she didn\u2019t take it, the gesture to at least let us feel like she wanted to hear our opinion (even if a moot gesture), would have been nice. We\u2019ve since \u201cgotten over it,\u201d I\u2019m just telling that story to give you a perspective of how your daughters might feel. You are still NTA and I think someday they will realize why you did it and look back and think it was the right thing/the kind thing to do. \n\nThey may also have some misplaced anger that therapy might help. Since they probably couldn\u2019t get mad at their mom because she sounds like she just cuts people off if she\u2019s mad, they may have unconsciously directed their anger at someone \u201csafe\u201d and \u201ceasy\u201d to get mad at, which is Caleb.\n\nETA: I hope that makes sense. I think the issue (if similar to mine), is that since they grew up in the house, they view the house as \u201cour house,\u201d by moving someone in without asking them about it first, it solidifies that it is not \u201cours\u201d but \u201cyour\u201d house. I know that\u2019s not how you meant to make them feel, but as someone on the other side, that\u2019s how it feels. I always viewed the house I grew up in as the \u201cfamily\u201d home and \u201cour\u201d house, even after moving out. My mom moving her boyfriend in without asking, even as a moot gesture, how we feel about it, solidified that it was just \u201cher\u201d house. Again, NTA, just wanted to tell you how it\u2019s a weird feeling on the other side, even if that feeling isn\u2019t necessarily correct.", "NTA but it sounds like all three kids have had a rough go of their mother. Any favouritism and golden child benefits Caleb got wasn\u2019t his doing or his fault, and him being kicked out now is proof of it.

Sorry that you are being extorted with not being able to see your grandchild.", "You're a better man than me. NTA.", "Nta....you're children are adults. They moved out. They have no say in who you allow to love there. They need to grow up. Seriously.", "NTA.", "NTA. You're looking out for a family member in trouble, one you're not even blood related to. You're being a good person. Your bio kids have both moved out, they get no say at all who lives with you now. \n\nI get your kids are still smarting from the favouritism, whether real or perceived, but that's not Caleb's fault, he had zero control over that. He's their brother, they should care more about the fact he's just been disowned by their mother for something as stupid as the fact he's gay. He's obviously going through a really rough time right now, and he needs support. \n\nStand your ground on this one. Caleb needs you. I understand it's hard, though, being prevented from seeing your grandkid, but there's not really anything you can do about that unless you want to come off an heartless (as massively unChristian even) as your ex. \n\nYour bio kids need to grow the hell up and support their brother in his time of need.", "Sorry your kids turned into their mother. You didn't deserve that.", "NTA\n\nIt was very kind of you to take him in. Your ex is terrible.", "NTA.  You are helping out a relative who has been thrown out of his house by his homophobic mother.  You own the house.  If this is the hill they are going to die on, they are losing out on what appears to be an empathetic and giving mother.  Thank you for protecting the boy.", "NTA. \n\nYour kids' resentment is misplaced. They should only be mad at their mom, not at Caleb. It isn't his fault that his mom favored him over Mia and Jamie, and apparently, she's thrown him out of the house for some homophobic bigotry. \n\nPlus - your kids are grown and out of the house. Caleb moving in with you does not impact them at all! \n\nYou're doing a good thing for your nephew.", "NTA...but your kids certainly are. Wow. You took in a vulnerable, homeless kid. And your kids are choosing to blame their brother for their mother's bad behavior?\n\nHow is it his fault his mother is a horrible human? It seems all of the kids are victims in one way or another. \n\nYou can't win with one. Do right by the nephew. His longterm wellbeing is truly more important than the tantrum your kids are throwing right now. I am really so sorry you are being punished for being a good person.", "NTA SO MUCH NTA.\nYour kids need to get over themselves and your son needs to stop weaponising your granddaughter.\nSigned- A lesbian who has nieces she's never seen because she's gay.", "Your ex treated them all the same eventually - your children just got their dismissive treatment earlier. NTA", "Nta.", "NTA. I wonder if there is more to the story between your nephew and your children. Have you asked why they are so upset?", "Hugs. \u2764\ufe0f.  You are NTA.  You did what was right by your nephew but have hurt your adult children in the process.  \n\nYour adult children have BIG feelings about Caleb and with VERY GOOD reasons, they were treated poorly by their mother, Caleb was the golden child who could do no wrong they were afterthoughts or not considered at all. You were their safe place, that was taken away when you moved him in and they feel betrayed because of it.  \n\nYes your children are grown but if those feelings haven\u2019t been worked through they won\u2019t be able to move on ,so age isn\u2019t the standard here, emotional growth is,and unfortunately it doesn\u2019t seem like that is happening.  \n\nMy suggestion is therapy for you and your adult children if that isn\u2019t a possibility then for your relationships with your kids find your nephew another place to live.", "You, sir, are a better human than I ever hoped to be. Caleb needs someone to step up and you did. I hope your children see you who you are and realize that Caleb is innocent of the favoritism. \n\nYou are definitely NTA!", "Did you point out that they do not live in your house anymore?  They do not get to decide who lives in your house and who doesn\u2019t.  He needs help.  He couldn\u2019t help how their mother treated him. \nMaybe you should tell them that if they have problems with the favoritism shown by their mother\u2026they should take it up with her.", "Maybe YTA for raising AH children.", "NTA. Your daughters are just as bad as your x. Keep Caleb and drop them.", "Your children are a bunch of entitled AHs, you are not.", "NAH\n\nbut you have to decide if a relationship with Caleb is worth loosing your other children", "NTA. You are kind for taking him in. Your kids are being ridiculous.", "you're children are adults and they don't even live at home. they need to get the fuck over themselves and grow up. NTA. maybe remind them that unlike them, their brother didn't have two parents", "First and foremost, I APPLAUD you for being there for this young man who is, not only young, but also in a (literally) fearful time of his life.  It doesn't matter the \"family\" connection:  you are a savior, right here, right now, and hopefully, Caleb knows that.\n\nI understand your kids' hostility towards Caleb.  But this is due to their mother.  This is really about HER, not Caleb.  There is no way for you to have them understand this, short of letting them see this thread, and everyone's responses.  They are old enough to read, and interpret.  Be strong:  you'll see your grandchildren.  It's just...the victim pile-up from Sarah is a little bigger than anyone realized.  (Especially with this cult, what bs.)\n\nGood on you, Sir, for giving Caleb an anchor. (And if you are in the US, double that!)", "OP, do you know how Caleb reacted to the favouritism? How he treated  your girls while they were under their mother's roof?\n\nNot liking a half sibling/cousin due to a parents' favouritism is one thing. But not caring they got kicked out and have nowhere to go is another thing", "Providing a home for someone facing both homelessness and bigotry IS NOT favouritism! \n\nNTA", "This is what you need to say to your children.", "Honestly I\u2019m just stuck on OP being selfless enough to even have a relationship with his nephew/ex wife\u2019s affair child. \n\nNTA, you seem like a good man OP. I hope your kids come around to realize it too", "All of this, NTA obviously.", "Yes this. Well said.", "she is as good at being a christian as she was at being a wife.", "Sometimes, there can be nothing more hateful than the love of a Christian", "Amen to that!", "Yep. I think OP might need to throw in a little \"this isn't me favoring Caleb over you. I'm just trying to help him out, as I would either of you if you needed it.\"\n\nJealousy between siblings can be brutal.", "The only way I see them not caring is if Caleb acted liked he was better than them. Rubbing the favouritism in there faces", "There are charities set up to help kids who have been kicked out for being LGBTQIA. It is awful.", "Turn your back on sinners or turn your back on God. Your choice.", "The mom already turned her backs towards her daughters. What she did with Caleb is really not that surprising given her character.", "Why, exactly, should OP ask who can move into his home when Jamie and Mia don't live there anymore? OP needs to ask them how they'd feel in Caleb's place if they were kicked out. It's not Caleb or OP'S fault how their mom favored Caleb. The other option mentioned is for Caleb to *move to another country*. They're being entitled AHs. I get being angry and hurt over mom's favoritism and abandoning them, but that isn't OP'S fault. They're grown adults and being petty.", "In what sense did OP (these adult children's father) abandon them? Even their mother didn't abandon them - they moved out because they felt she was showing preference to their half brother.", "**their** parents didn\u2019t abandon them. OP is their father and seemed to have been a good father, considering they chose to spend more time living with him than they did with their mom. OP\u2019s son is withholding visits with his infant daughter because\u2026 why? because OP is doing right by his nephew? there are definitely assholes here. OP is the only one that isn\u2019t.", "Yeah that\u2019s what I really want to know. Like was Caleb innocent or was he the golden child that happily used it to torment them? I understand wanting to take in Caleb, but I do feel like we need to understand how Caleb treated them as well before just calling op\u2019s daughters the AH", "They prly see him as the embodiment of their family falling apart. It's not his fault, it's their mom's, but they still want someone to hate, and their mother's affair baby is an easy target. \n\nIt's super unfair to Caleb.", "Strong disagree.  Why does he need to consult his grown up kids who live on their own for anything?", "I think this is part of what they need to say to their children...\n\nbut I think OP needs to temper this with a bit of empathy as well.\n\nTeens don't move out of their mother's house because of a little favoritism.  My guess is things were not pretty before they switched over to OP's house, and he probably never got all the story, because they were confused and hurting teenagers and probably never processed the entirely of it themselves.\n\nIt also wasn't that long ago.\n\nI think whatever OP says needs to be bracketed with a strong helping of \"You two are my children...  I love you more than I could ever love anyone else, ever.  But I also won't stand around and watch my ex-wife ruin another kid's life because of her new found homophobia.  I offered Caleb a place here so he can finish his degree, no other family would have been able to offer him a place that would allow that.  I understand you're deeply upset with me, and I'm willing to listen to how you feel...  including more about what happened with your mother when you were younger.  It never occurred to me that this choice would be upsetting to you two, and quite frankly the strength of your reactions has me second guessing a lot, including whether I did enough to protect you back then, if I should have done more to get you out of her house sooner.  I hope we can come to a place where you feel secure in my love for you, and can place the blame for all of this squarely at your mother's feet, where it belongs, not Caleb's.\"\n\nNAH.  OP's children are genuinely scared, due to past trauma, OP can't Tough Love them into understanding, he needs to Love Love them.", "Agreed, this comment is worded very well and I imagine it would be a great way to get your concerns across to your children, while also acknowledging that they\u2019re being ridiculous. NTA, OP, and good on you for helping your nephew when you could have just as easily held a grudge against him when he\u2019s innocent in all this.", "Or just show them the post. I don\u2019t think that is always a great solution to problems like these, but this time. Yes.", "Excellent observation! Truth!", "That\u2019s how you know they are all hot air. A true Christian isn\u2019t going to behave that way.", "Exactly! Shun the people who hurt their children for the body and mind God gave them.", "thats quite literally not how christianity works, in fact thats the opposite of how christianity works", "Didn\u2019t Jesus hang out with prostitutes?", "Show us where Jesus condemns homosexuals. Go on.", "Where did he also leave YOU with the power to judge anyone else?\n\nJohn 13:34\n\n>A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.\n\nLuke 6:31-38\n\n>And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them. \u201cIf you love those who love you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to get back the same amount. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil. ...\n\nEphesians 4:32\n\n>Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.", "I mean, in a way, the mom may have abandoned them in the emotional sense, which is abandonment nonetheless.\n\nYou are right in that OP has stepped up as a parent, both for his kids and for his nephew. However, the kids still likely have trauma regarding Caleb, even if it is irrational. In their eyes, their mom abandoned them over Caleb, so what is stopping OP from abandoning them over Caleb.\n\nYou could make the argument that OP does not have to justify who he takes into his house to his adult children, but a harsh response like this would likely sour any chance of fixing the rift between OP and his kids, which I doubt he wants. If OP wants to salvage his relationship with his kids, he needs to meet with them and have an honest conversation with them about how the situation is not a \"them vs caleb\" one, it is a \"their mother has failed another one of her children\" situation. Help them to see that despite what their mother may have thought (and indirectly taught them), they are not so different than Caleb.", "Cause he cares about their feelings and emotional well-being ?", "Idk man, you have a *lot* more faith in teenagers than I do. Shit, I stopped seeing my dad as a teenager because he wanted to back out of allowing me to go to a *dance* when he found out the friend (who I had grown up with and he knew) I was going with *as friends* was bisexual. Saw him like 4 times between 15 and 28 when he died. Once by accident at a restaurant wherein *he* left in a hissy fit because he couldn't \"stand to eat near his mortal enemies\" the dramatic asshat. The other three were in his final three months.

That all sounds like your dad was an asshat and you wanted no part of it.", "I\u2019m not being snarky, I genuinely thought Jesus hung out with prostitutes and did not turn his back on them.
