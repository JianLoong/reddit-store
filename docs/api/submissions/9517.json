And if you\u2019re that set on aesthetics, I can\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t find another meaningful role for this girl, such as others have suggested: walking her dad up the aisle. She could even carry something else up the aisle like the rings or materials for another ceremonious wedding tradition. If she sings or plays music, you could invite her to perform a solo or special accompaniment for one of your pieces, etc.  And bonus: if she gets a special role outside of being a bridesmaid, you could take her dress shopping for a fancy wedding party dress that feels a little bit more personal to her, that would be a great bonding opportunity pre-ceremony. \n\nWeddings are tricky and stressful and many couples have conflicting visions about how things should play out, and who should be involved.

And she is surprised that the kid, her fianc\u00e9, AND her friends think she\u2019s an asshole. \n\nAnd after that, she says she\u2019s \u201crefusing\u201d rather than thinking \u201coh, I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d want to but now that I know it\u2019s important to her and my fianc\u00e9, maybe I should consider it or think of another way to include her so she feels excited about our marriage.\u201d  The daughter is going to be a much bigger part of her married life than any of her friends or even sister and that doesn\u2019t seem to be reflected in her vision for the wedding, almost like she\u2019s prefer the daughter didn\u2019t even exist.", "I think a man that lets his child make wedding decisions that the actual bride is uncomfortable with might end up finding himself alone first. No woman would put up with that kind of dynamics for long", "Yes because no teenage girl anywhere, whose parent is getting remarried, has ever done anything manipulative or shady to stir the pot.   \n\n\nI get that we don't really have enough info to go either way, but all these YTA seem to have spontaneously forgotten that teenagers are shitty.   \n\n\nHow is this not even being considered?", "at all.", "No, with mixed marriages, it includes all involved, and that means step kids too. You seem to not understand that as a step parent, you aren't the star. Your spouse will ALWAYS choose the kids over you, especially if you are this toxic.   \nMixed marriages join the kids as well. You are too hung up on the \"big day\" that you have no idea the whole point of it.", "This being OP\u2019s hill to die on when she already has 24 bridesmaids or some other ridiculous number is absurd. This is generating ill will and for what?", "Yeah, I mean the kid is a teenager, she very well may never see OP as her parent or stepparent, whether she\u2019s a bridesmaid or not. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Maybe OP should talk to her about how she feels about everything, and if she even wants to be on that side of the wedding party. She may feel obligated to be a bridesmaid if asked, but resent the situation, preferring to navigate her relationship with OP on her terms.", "The kid will ALWAYS be important to the parent, even after reaching adulthood. You seem to lack understanding of that important fact. He doesn't need a selfish thing trying to shove his own daughter out by alienating her on purpose. Wannabe wife is disposable, not the daughter. You sound like a bitter step mom who still hasn't learned the lesson.", "When it comes to weddings, the sun hates children, goes berserk if vegetarians won\u2019t serve meat, and has an absolute tantrum if there isn\u2019t going to be lashings of booze. It\u2019s not a relationship ceremony, it\u2019s a chance for twenty somethings to get blackout fucked up on someone else\u2019s credit card.", "I didn't get that impression, but I guess it doesn't matter to me. Whether the teenage girl whose life is being altered by this girl who literally just started dating her father is being shitty or not doesn't really matter to me because the OP is the grown up and as the grown up marrying this girl's father I think she should just say yes you can be a bridesmaid.", "Justified criticism of bridezillas had now gone so far that brides are attacked for wanting to pick their own fucking bridesmaids. It\u2019s ridiculous.", "I agree with you. There is no scenario where actually including the daughter in all that comes with being a bridesmaid yields anything positive. SD thinks it's only a dress and a little walk down the aisle but being a bridesmaid is so much more than that, not to mention she'll be odd one out in a group of women over twice her age who've all know each other for 30+ years. Dad should find some other way to include daughter in the wedding party.", "> and this will have a knock on effect\n\nAs someone else pointed out, this issue is technically NTA. However, there is a big difference between a \"good wedding\" and a \"good marriage\". OP will have the former at the expense of the latter if she excludes the step-daughter. \n\nFrankly, it makes no sense to me why OP would marry a man if she doesn't like his daughter. Precursor to a very toxic relationship. The onus is on the father to protect his daughter from a woman like OP.", "I'm not well-versed in weddings, but is being a bridesmaid the only imaginable form of inclusion? Why can't she be a groomswoman?", "This is being very underplayed.  Bridesmaids do a lot in the run up and day of a wedding that a 16 year old might come to resent.  You are sent on a ton of errands and track people down with messages and run interference and make sure the bride eats something before 12 glasses of champagne and oh shit someone get cousin Jimmy away from the photographer and track down the father of the bride for the dance.  You are on the clock.  There are so many pictures your face hurts.  She doesn't just get to take the fun bits then spin in circles on the dance floor like the flower girl does.", "The groom should only have a say for his party. Or they can designate her as a flower girl. \n\nGrooms pick their line of people, brides pick theirs.", "He could but it does go against tradition and would likely be a slap in the face to the daughter, especially now.", "If you're marrying someone with a child, you 100% are taking on parental responsibilities, yeah you're not their parent and there are limits, but this is a terrible mindset if marrying someone with a child from a prior marriage.\n\nAlso the step-daughter to be is a minor, and making her a bridesmaid doesn't mean she has to be included in the bridal shower and what not, especially since your correct and they generally are adult oriented and she potentially wouldn't be allowed to go to certain venues and events, but this is about the wedding, not the lead up.", ">OP is not a parent, and should not be expected to give up an aspect of her side of the experience for his child. Choosing to marry someone with a child does not automatically give you parental duties and responsibilities (ie sacrificing a portion of a life changing experience to accommodate for said child).\n\nI would disagree. If you marry someone with minor children, you are agreeing to take on those children and love them as your own. I know the daughter is 16 and maybe doesn't need or even want a motherly figure, but I hope OP knows that marry someone (or even seriously dating someone) with children means that your own plans do have to alter to fit what is in the best interest of the child/family.\n\nEdit: i would say tho that the step daughter could be a bridesmaid without having to forgo the bachelorette party etc. I don't think it has to be \"all or nothing\"", "Actually when you marry someone with a child under 18 you absolutely do take on a parental role, unless you're trying to be an ass and make sure they don't like you in the future.\n\nMarrying someone with adult independent children? Yeah, it would be a bit weird if you tried to parent them.\n\nUnder 18, your spouse will still be parenting their child and, while your role might be different and you might not have the same dynamic after a certain age with your stepchild as their parent does, you still have to treat them as the major part of your spouse's life that they rightfully are. Think about it from the child's perspective. You're coming into their life and affecting it. You can seriously screw things up for them if you don't at least try to be a positive presence in their lives.\n\nI really don't understand your perspective on this at all.", "Exactly.  This isn't the 80's - people should be in the wedding party if the person getting married they are closest to aka her actual father.  She's a girl so she should be a bridesmaid is ridiculously old fashioned.  She would probably enjoy helping her father day of way more than helping stepmom.  I know kids think it's just an opportunity to stand in front of the church in a pretty dress but being a bridesmaid is a responsibility and a lot can be expected of you day of that a 16 year old might resent.", "Have you heard of sarcasm?.... \n\noi\\_that\\_nander was obviously being facetious because the other commenter had a dumb argument lmao", "Yes, junior bridesmaids are a thing.   \n\n\nNormally though one does not become a bridesmaid simply because they ran to daddy. She is 16. Junior bridesmaids are typically 9-14. Of course there is no rule that says it can't be someone who is 16.   \n\n\nDo YOU know a teenage girl who is 16 who doesn't think she's an adult?   \n\n\nI'm just saying....this seems like a trap for OP.", "I've been in multiple weddings with minors as groomsmen and bridesmaids.  They do the stuff that's appropriate, and don't do the stuff that isn't.  Not that hard", "9 year olds and 16 year olds are very different animals.", "Maybe people just have different traditions, but mostly I've attended weddings where the best man and any groomsmen are from the groom's side; the MOH and bridesmaids and flower girls come from the bride's side. (In my part of Scotland, 'flower girl' usually just means a very young bridesmaid.)  \n\n\nWhen I got married, my husband's adult son was his best man. His adult daughter attended as a guest with her partner.   \n\n\nMy best friend was my Matron of Honour and two of my cousins' kids were flower girls.  \n\n\nMaybe some other role could be found for the stepdaughter - an usher,  perhaps? (Do they have those at US weddings?)", "Step daughter should automatically be included. This is a \u201ctrap\u201d set by the stepdaughter sounds ridiculous. And if this option is on the table, why would you even marry that person? Grow up.", "Reading comprehension is needed here. The step daughter is mad at possibly being excluded from being in the wedding, so she\u2019s 100% going to be a whiny shit when she can\u2019t go to the bar. OP knows this, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s reluctant to have her soon to be step daughter involved.", "Having raised a kid through both ages, yes they are. They\u2019re also both capable of understanding \u201cI very much want you to be a bridesmaid and be part of this special occasion, but the bachelorette party is for adults\u201d.", "That part! And if it were a younger child, a flower girl would be perfect", "Disagree with your interpretation & assumptions."]}
