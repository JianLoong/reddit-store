OP wants the people she's close to in her party, and including the step daughter might not even improve the relationship anyway. That's the same reason some of the people in those posts use to justify trying to force someone to have a member of their family in their party when they aren't wanted in the party \"it a chance to bond\" or \"it was a chance to fix your relationship!\"if G wants his daughter in one of the wedding parties, why can't he make her a grooms maid on his side", "No. Your bridal party is about you.

And obviously let her be a bridesmaid if she still wants to be. \n\nHonestly, OP should get her a special necklace and take her out for lunch and explain that she\u2019s sorry and wants her to be involved.

It honestly sounds like OP must be living for the drama, because I cannot imagine making such a tactless decision that hurts a kid\u2019s feelings. And for what? To protect her super important plan of having exactly 6 bridesmaids? Because having her stepchild by her side will ruin the whole thing? YTA, OP. You had an opportunity to bond with your new family member and you blew it because you \u201calways planned\u201d to not include anyone from your husband\u2019s family in your party even if it would make your life way happier long term.

It's just a given that parents/stepparents will involve their children in the wedding, unless the child doesnt want to. You are joining a family of a father and his child, that girl is a member of your immediate family now. You are sending a message to her that you don't consider that to be the case. The daughter is going to be expected to make room in her life for you yet you can't make space for her as a bridesmaid? Most people attending that wedding will find that very telling of your attitude. Really if I was the dad I wouldnt be marrying someone who wasn't trying to foster a good relationship with my child.
