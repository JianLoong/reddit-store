YTA.", "Idk if it's about that, I think it's just something she's planned for a long time and it wasn't discussed with her beforehand that stepdaughter wanted to be a bridesmaid or that dad wanted her to be one", "Which is how it should be. Our children come first.", "\u201cChild centered activities\u201d?!? She\u2019s 16?!? She should be invited to the bridal shower, regardless.  And just because she\u2019s a bridesmaid doesn\u2019t mean you would invite a 16 to a bachelorette.  What other situations are you envisioning??", "She doesn\u2019t HAVE to include stepdaughter, but we don\u2019t want to see in a few months a post on relationship advice saying \u201cmy stepdaughter hates me and it\u2019s ruining my marriage\u201d", "She\u2019ll have her six others to do that.  Stop it. Including step daughter is about who she is marrying and who will be her family.", "She is in the wedding party with our parents", "She has some of this info up above.", "In every wedding I\u2019ve been to where one or both have kids, the kids have been included, in a major way.", "Yes I agree. It shouldn\u2019t be the expectation. But it\u2019s better to discuss it before so that everyone is aware. Avoids situations like in this post: couple agrees, sd is mad, husband changes his mind. Best to discuss", "If I were your fianc\u00e9, this would be a HUGE red flag.  If you\u2019re willing to exclude his daughter from the wedding, what else are you going to try to exclude her from?  You are starting off on the wrong foot.  Welcome to the Wicked Step-Mother\u2019s club.", "Still seems like you're overwhelmingly TA", "Yet the only people's opinions that should matter is your fianc\u00e9's and his daughters because that is who you're forming a family with.", "seems like a there is a trend lol", "*Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm*", "Of course it's up to you, you choose whoever you want. But that doesn't mean your choice doesn't make you an asshole! Making a choice that further alienates your stepdaughter and sours the experience of the wedding for your husband is an asshole move, but you are still free to choose it. \nYTA.", "How\u2019d you get 75/25 out of 5 people? Wouldn\u2019t it be more like 80/20??????", "my toughts exactly", "I agree for the most part BUT she's not a friend that doesn't belong to the group, she's her future close-family member.", "And the decision is still up to the bride to say yay or nay.\n\nForcing against the will of the bride is shite", "Agreed. That's what makes it tough for stepparents. OP should really consider if she's up for it", "Agreed. That's what makes it tough for stepparents. OP should really consider if she's up for it", "Thing is, it's entirely entitled of the kid to push here. And it's a good sign that this will not be the last entitled move she can expect from the kid. And her fiance is enabling it. \n\nHopefully, OP is watching for any red flags in that family dynamic, BEFORE they wed.", "but does she have an actual role? because this wedding will be creating a family and I can see why she\u2019d want to stand out a little", "Doing what?", "Could she be in the wedding on your husband's side? Still get a pretty dress and hair/make up done with the other bms? Or she could even have a pretty suit? Think Rory Gilmore as best man. Google it if you are unfamiliar.\n\nI think compromise would be best here. I get you have a specific vision. But, this could be a lasting hurt. Maybe sit down and figure out what parts of the wedding are important to her and the specifics of how she'd like to be included. Communication is going to win the day.", "Thank you, Im trying to figure out if it was added after I asked or if im seriously so dim i skipped past it \ud83e\udd23", "We don't have the custom of bridesmaid in my country, so maybe I'm wrong with this. But how much can you bond with a 16 year old in this situation? If they have parties or gatherings, will they have to accomodate to her schedule or the fact that she is a minor? It really different the obligation of a 30 yo women of a 16 yo. \n\nThe only solution I can think off to not cause problem is for the stepdaughter to only be a bridesmaid for the ceremony. But the fact that they assumed she will be one without even asking OP give the feeling, IMO, she isn't going to be satisfied with it.\n\nEdit for typo", "It's the husband's wedding too...", "nifty thing about weddings - they serve as a test for the relationship. if the bride and groom can't even get on the same page about something as simple and low stakes as the wedding party, it's a very strong indicator they shouldn't be getting married.", "I personally think it\u2019s great that fianc\u00e9 is on the side of his daughter. Too many divorced couples find a new partner and immediately neglect their children. His daughter is his daughter no matter what and should definitely take precedence over his wife, fianc\u00e9, or girlfriend that could break up with him at any given point of time. Also, if you think about it, it\u2019s amazing the stepdaughter WANTS to be apart of the wedding. I couldn\u2019t even count how many posts here that include something along the lines of \u201cmy future stepchildren won\u2019t come to my wedding\u201d or \u201cmy step children hate me\u201d if she wants to be a part of the wedding at least it shows she\u2019s supportive of the marriage", "She doesn't say the kid pushed. And i think if i was marrying someone with daughters id be happy they wanted to be part of the wedding .", "I added after I saw this post", "It's more about showing how she sees her futur step-daughter than the wedding in itself. I don't really get the bridemaid thingy at all but the fact that she is telling the stepdaughter \"bridesmaid are only for important person in my life and you are not one of them\" while marrying her dad is a really shitty move imo", "The cultural differences in weddings never cease to baffle me on this sub. \nBridesmaids are little girls where I come from, usually under 12 or 13. I was one when I was 4, for my godmother's wedding. I remember nothing, but the pictures are adorable.\n\nI assume step-daughter might have been satisfied with any role during the wedding, if it came from OP originaly, but now that there has been rejection anything will seem like a tainted consolation prize.\nThis is a screw up on OP's part, becaus she didn't even think to include her step-daughter. \n\nI've seen junior bridesmaids mentioned on this sub before, maybe that's an option?", "So she can among his groomsmen", "Then why couldn't she be part of her father's entourage?", "\"She got really angry at this and G took her side\"\nThat's pushing. And now the fiance took a side, instead of checking his kid's entitlement.", "Thank you, I thought I was crazy for a second", "Well OP clearly made her informed that she doesn't think she is or ever will be someone chez consider close to her. When you hear that from the person marrying your dad, becoming your family member, you can get angry. Especially when you are a 16yo having to process that your father is building a family with someone else (someone that doesn't seem to want you in that new family)"]}
