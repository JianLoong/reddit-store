Sometimes people who didn't grow up with money, get it, and spend irresponsibly because they never learned fiscal responsibility. I understand it's nice to splurge, but your fiance has a right to be concerned that you decided to blow 2k in one day just because you could. I would suggest taking a class in personal finances.", "I'm going to go with NAH. To be honest, I think it's fair that your fiance was concerned you went through about $2,000 in one day. That's a lot of money, and could be a flag for some financial irresponsibility. \n\nI get that you wanted to treat yourself, and it's your money so you're allowed! But compatability in financial management is a really big deal in a marriage. If your fiance is more cautious overall with money, this probably shocked him a lot.\n\nAlso, if he's been picking up the slack in your relationship with your previous lack of disposable income (like he's been paying for the majority of your dates, eating out, whatever) this might feel like a bit of a slap in the face for him.", "NTA. But sit down with your fianc\u00e9 and really talk about the issue and discuss future budgets. If your fianc\u00e9 has never experienced poverty, he may not understand why you spent your first check the way you did. \n\nI grew up very poor and I did the same with my first paycheck. No regrets. But after that, I drew up a budget, stuck to it, and learned to be financially responsible. \n\nI\u2019d strongly recommend a financial literacy class. You and your fianc\u00e9 can go together. Growing up poor doesn\u2019t mean your family was irresponsible with money, there are a lot of different reasons for poverty. But it does usually mean there are financial things you\u2019ve never experienced or seen growing up and that can be a challenge.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s so exciting to get that first real paycheck! You have to celebrate!\n\nFor my first real/adult paycheck, I took my parents and fianc\u00e9e out to dinner as a celebration and thank you for their support in getting me there. I also bought some work clothes, got some much needed service done on my car, and spent a little money on video games.\n\nI knew that I would be responsible with my future paychecks and I was. It was a one time celebration. Nothing wrong with that if it\u2019s not at the expense of people depending on you (children, spouse, etc)\n\nJust let him know it was a one time thing and that you are dedicated to saving for a future together and being responsible with your money.

The NAs (most orphans or from very poor families) lived in the hospital attic. Her first paycheck was 30$, the entirety of which she spent on her first new dress.   \nFor the rest of the month she had to borrow soap, stockings, and hairpins from all the other girls. Which she in turn provided for the next girl who excitedly spent the first money she ever had on new shoes. \u2764\ufe0f  \nShe said it made her appreciate the dress and the money more. She lived the rest of her life frugally and helped others often. She also said if she could have gone back she'd have done the same thing, because being able to final give herself something special gave her the confidence to know that she could make her life anything she wanted.  \n\n\nI sincerely hope you had the BEST day ever OP.

And, its all gone, there's no getting it back.\n\nI always worked for my money, as a teen I had jobs available and saved like crazy to reach goals. While later I have splurged, I can do so for very little and still be very happy. Today I splurged - bought a houseplant and a fancy pot for it, makeup, along with a fancy lunch. $60 made me happy for the week!\n\nSo, I see it more as waste than a splurge. Spending $500 would be a splurge, saying goodbye to it all is a bit much to my thinking. How are you going to cover expenses until next payday?", "NTA. As long as you don't make it a habit every paycheck there's nothing wrong with what you did. Treating yourself once in a while is important.\n\nKeep an eye on the bf though. He sounds a bit controlling and that could mean bad news.", "NTA. This actually made me tear up a little bit.\n\nI remember getting my first pay check and my first order of business was to go to Walgreens and buy a big bag of sour patch kids.

Please understand nit in a judgey way but twenties is for living and figuring yourself out. Also I think we need to know is he saving is he also investing into this?

Make sure you are your priority.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m in the minority. I was ready to spend my first check on an expensive purse but I decided to save.

It's easy to fall into bad habits.", "Nta. Splurging with your first real paycheck is a right of passage.its not indicative of poor financial future (unless you skipped bills to splurge). I'm sure you look and feel fabulous in your new dress and hairstyle! Now you can set forth your \"real budget\" and don't forget to include small goals and splurged into your budget. Obviously no more 2000 dollar splashes but yes being in a new job you need to budget to expand your professional wardrobe, maintain your haircut etc so don't skip those! You are fortunate in that living at home your expenses are lower so you have the opportunity to save more. \nWord of note though keep your savings under your own control only. Your fiance may have a valid concern or he may be overly controlling so it would be wise for you to keep finances separate for now.

Yeah save for your wedding, but also put aside an emergency fund, something for a house or a car in the future, and even some fun money, you are allowed to treat yourself. Even if what you're earning is not much you can still make the best of it.", "NAH\n\nI think your fiance is rightly concerned about using 2k(which I would consider quite a bit to where you said not much) in a single day as even for a night out thats quite a bit and fiance is trying to look into the future and has little evidence it wont be a pattern for future paychecks unless you talk to him and set a plan(I assume he is saving money also and not just expecting you to do it?)\n\nI also think its pretty normal for someone at any age(especially later teens/early 20s) to go on a bit of a spending splurge with first paycheck or two after a new job and treat themselves with goodies or services and then have the ability to settle it down with more responsible spending after that and to treat yourself is perfectly normal behavior with your own money so its not inherently wrong to have done so as long as its not a pattern and it shouldnt be held over you for that.", "NTA \n\nIts your Money, though, be carefully, dont spends all your Money", "NTA.

You went from having no extra money, ever, to 2000 dollars, and you blew it all in one day. On yourself only. If I was your fiance, I would definitely worry you don't have the self discipline to save. \n\nAlso, I'd wonder how/why you went so long without getting any sort of job.

And coming from a poor background, you likely didn't have the opportunity to have good financial habits modeled for you aside from raw survival poverty finance.\n\nYour fiance is right about saving being important, but he's wrong that treating yourself here and there is \"irresponsible\". It's important to enjoy life along the way, not *only* be looking towards what's next. It's now your responsibility to ensure that this spending spree was just a treat and that you're going to set yourself up for savings and using money responsibly going forward.\n\nThe one thing I would do if I could go back to my 20s is put a little money each check into an index fund of the total stock market or the S&P 500 (the former mostly containing the latter anyway).

If you are responsible with them, your fiance will understand this as a one-time thing, hopefully understand, and be supportive.

Yes, you should save and be responsible, but you should also try to enjoy yourself and not only live for the future. It's a balance and it's not always about money, just joy and happiness. \n\nYou guys are both young. I would encourage you to keep your money separate for now and your fianc\u00e9 should not be policing your spending in this way.

That's, at least, about 2 years you've been out of high school. And while I would LOVE for even college students to be able to study without needing to worry about money, that's hardly the norm. Every student I know (and I'm one) works at LEAST part time, or has crazy good scholarships AND has supportive parents.\nSo, for the last couple years you've been living entirely off of money from your parents. For sure, if you didn't discuss ahead of time with them and get an \"okay\" on splurging your first check that's an instant YTA right there. \nBut let's say you got they're okay to go wild for the first check, you're not totally off the hook yet. Because you're starting into a relationship where the sharing of financial responsibility is so much the norm, it's written into law. If you're planning to marry someone, your financial affairs are absolutely each other's business, and him getting upset about you blowing TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS is absolutely a reasonable reaction. At the very very least, if you plan to spend that much money, you've gotta at least inform your partner ahead of time. Unless you both had previously agreed that your income was yours to spend at will, that's another YTA\n\n\nALSO, this isn't relevant to if you are or aren't the a**hole, but how the HECK is two grand not much???

Went and got myself a really properly nice dress, went and got some gourmet type food at a Fancy coffee shop. That was maybe half of that paycheck.

The hair dye was probably not more than $300, which is the cost for the more extensive types (platinum blonde or some very complex vivid style). With all of that, I'm guess she ended up spending less than 1k. If she can still afford to pay her bills, rent, and buy groceries, she's probably more than okay. \n\nAs for it feeling like a slap in the face, I can understand that. I'm sure he was excited to also have more money for himself. I feel like maybe she should have split up these expenses between a couple checks, but I also absolutely understand the wanting to have what you never did. \n\nNTA", "Yes but since the parents are still supporting OP maybe she should have at least offered to spend or give them money.", "Right?

You believe what you want to, but to me that's pretty telling.\n\nAnd yes, she prob left out a bunch of stuff. Would you not if you wanted to look better?
