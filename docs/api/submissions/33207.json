As a fellow introvert, I completely understand where you are coming from. There is nothing wrong with wanting that extra layer of security for privacy. \n\nIf your parents don't understand that or think it's ridiculous, just tell them that is their problem. I would just say, 'I am not registering you, end of discussion', and then if they say anything about it, walk away or tell them to leave. \n\nYour home, your choice. If they don't like it, they don't have to visit.", "I don't agree that you can't take it back(i'm sure you can revoke with gated guard).\n\nThat said, don't do it.  If they want to visit they can call YOU FIRST, then you can call guard to expect them at VISITOR's entrance(Which they are).\n\nBe well, and stiffen that spine, it feels a little noodly\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIf you give them access they will abuse it. It is best not to give them access.", "NTA\nKeep your privacy. There is no reason they need to be registered you moved into this community so you could have the privacy. Your parents are NOT entitled to visit whenever they want.", "NTA I don't even understand what the issue is.  Your mother still can visit anytime.  \n\nIf her issue is that she doesn't want to have to announce her visit first, then ALL THE MORE SO she needs to have that boundary established anyway.", "NTA and stand your ground.  You know what will happen and you have the power to prevent it, so please do.", "NTA but I don\u2019t really think there is a real conflict here\n\nYou refused to register your parents, as you have every right to do. What are they going to do now? Force the guard to register them? \n\nAlso in many gated communities you\u2019re actually not allowed to register someone who doesn\u2019t live in the compound for security reasons", "NTA\n\nNext step would be a key to your house and them \"visiting\" when you are absent.", "NTA OP.  Your parents sound like the worst type of entitled parents, so don\u2019t give them access.", "nta. if you wanted people to visit with no warning you probably wouldn\u2019t live in a gated community. needing permission is not as great an imposition as your mother thinks it is, and tbh this is a great lesson in interpersonal relationships; when we treat people badly and we fight often, we don\u2019t get an all access pass to their home. \u201cyou are a guest, not a resident.\u201d", "Well, at least you probably won\u2019t have to call the cops to get them off your porch. Follow the plan.  NTA", "NTA.  I doubt your neighbors would appreciate you registering a non-resident as a resident.", "If you register her car to your address you could lose your house if she gets in a bad accident. \n\nDo some research on liability in your area. Then tell her no.", "NTA, but I completely get it. I think my mom has had a key to every place I\u2019ve ever lived, and it would take some courage to tell her she\u2019s not getting that access if I moved into a new place. In your situation I\u2019d probably give them security gate access but not a key so they\u2019d have to knock, at least\u2026but I\u2019m also a non confrontational wimp.
