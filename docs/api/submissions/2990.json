Then my ex-boyfriend \"James\" (30m) entered the picture. I met him while in college and was completely head over heels for him. I thought we were going to get married, get a house, have babies, and all the other sappy RomCom cliches. He was the second boyfriend I ever had in life at the time.\n\nWhen my sister first met him she said that she couldn't possibly see what I saw in him and would sometimes show passive-aggressive hostility. My sister was one of the most important people in my life and I really wanted her and James to get along so I encouraged outings with the three of us from time to time. Then one day I got sick at one of the planned outings but insisted that it was okay for James and Anna to go without me.\n\nAfter that Anna and James became more friendly with one another and I was actually happy. Until one day my parents sat me down and told me that Anna was pregnant and how she was going to marry the father. I was shocked and when I asked who the father was my heart was shattered when they told me it was James. Anna was staying at our grandparents house in another state but when I went to confront James, his sister came out and apologized to me for the situation and that their parents and mine were pressuring Anna and James to marry after they got caught.\n\nI was so distraught and to make it up to me my parents offered to pay for my trip abroad as well as grad school while giving me an allowance. They told both Anna and me that the money was going to come out of whatever they had saved for her college expenses as restitution to me, and said that Anna needed to focus on being a mother first and that school would have to come later. After spending a lot of weeks sobbing over it I agreed to their offer and stopped speaking to Anna and James. Fast forward to now, James has passed away and Anna has two kids to support. She's yet to find a job that will pay her enough and decided to go back to school, Anna is struggling really hard with her finances and asked me if I would be willing to loan her the money and that she'd pay me back after graduation.\n\nI have the money and she knows it but I told her no.

AITA?\n\nETA: My sister was 18 and a senior in high school when she met James. She was 19/20 when she gave birth. Technically the money my parents gave me out of her college fund was theirs and just designated for Anna, she had no legal claim to it.

Not at all. You were very young, he was only your second relationship. I'm sure that it hurt like a dagger through your heart. But let's look at this from a bit of a distance: \n\nWhat you lost and gained: You lost a relationship with a boy that, despite the stars in your eyes, probably (as your second-ever serious relationship) probably would NOT have ended up being \"the one\" ... particularly now that we know that he had a wandering eye. You were heartbroken, but you were young and resilient, and would go on to have (from the sound of it) other successful relationships, as well as a good education and a stable life financially, emotionally and otherwise. You had grad school paid for, and to soothe your hurt, you were given a grand trip overseas. As badly as I'm sure your heart hurt, he was a college boyfriend, not a husband, and your life now is pretty darn good, and in the meantime...\n\nWhat Anna lost . . . and lost: From one terrible mistake made as a young woman (teenager?), falling for her sister's boyfriend that her sister had begged her to spend more time with and get to know better (and yes, it was stupid and awful of her, but my point is that she didn't PURSUE him with malicious intent . . . it sounds like she fell for him honestly, and the only truly cruel thing she did was act on it, which . . . honestly, I'm not trying to excuse it, but if we condemned every one of us who did a stupid, hateful thing in our teens or early 20s because of hormones, very few of us would come out unscathed) . . . from one stupid move, she ended up pregnant, and lost EVERYTHING. And I do mean everything. Sure, she \"got the guy\", but it doesn't even sound like they really loved each other; rather, they married because of parental pressure, hardly a fairytale. Then, instead of recognising that a young couple need to support themselves, your parents TOOK AWAY HER COLLEGE FUND, told her to \"focus being a mother\" (what does that even MEAN if not being properly educated so she can support her child and contribute to her family?), and her means of finishing her education . . . because she had sex and got pregnant. Then her husband died. So now she has no partner, no education, no way of getting a decent job, and two children to support.\n\nAll because of a stupid decision she made in the moment when she was barely into adulthood. A decision that changed both of your lives, and that you still see yourself as the victim of, even though you clearly came out far the better for it, of the two of you. \n\nLook, technically there are NAH. You are not morally required to give her the money. It belonged to your parents and they chose to punish her by taking it away from her and giving it to you to make up for what she'd done. But ethically? Truly? If you can afford to help her, given her situation (i.e. the money meant for her education went to you going on a grand tour overseas to make you feel better . . . and now she's got kids to support and no education) and you won't because she \"stole your college boyfriend\" way back when? You should be pretty ashamed of yourself. I won't come out and say that Y-T-A, but you're not a great person either if you can watch her and her kids suffer in this situation and still not forgive.", "How old was Anna when she got together with your boyfriend?

Even if the ex partners are not that serious, the act of betrayal is the one that makes  people cut them off from their lives. Sure, she was a teenager and teenagers do stupid things, but this was a double, she was having unprotected sex  and betraying her sister, you have to be more than stupid to do something like that.

If you look at the wording more closely it appears that Anna was still in high school or at the least had not started college while OP was closer to graduation if grad school was in her sights. \n\nIf you said your high school sister cheated with your college bf I think a lot of people would feel Anna was treated very poorly by being forced into a young marriage and having her future education taken away.

So who was going to watch the sister\u2019s child while she was in school? when their parents said Focus on being a mom that was their way of making it clear they wasn\u2019t gonna watch the child or help.

Especially since OP was already pressuring the girl into getting along with the boyfriend and would have reacted badly. \n\nOften victims try to normalize the assault in cases like these. It's actually a bigger red flag that the sister was uncomfortable around him and then that behavior suddenly changed. She may have been over-compensating to please her sister due to reeling from an assault with an already strained relationship. Since OP was the one forcing contact due to the tension, she may have felt like if she pretended to get along better OP would stop forcing her into situations alone with the boyfriend (thereby preventing her from being assaulted again) or that if she tried getting along better she could normalize the assault and try to convince herself.\n\nI was placed in a similar situation by a family member and SA at the age of 12 by someone my mother repeatedly forced contact with in a similar way OP did with her sister. I never acted like a perfect victim or like I hated him. At first I didn't fully understand what had happened because I had never had any sex education and was sheltered. At first, I tried to convince myself that maybe I was \"cool\" because a grown man liked me. That maybe it meant he was my boyfriend and loved me. Or that maybe I had wanted it to happen. One of the stages of grief is denial about what happened. Nobody outwardly recognized any issues with my relationship with that man or signs I was being assaulted. And my mom was the one forcing me to spend time with him, so I knew her reaction would be bad if I went to her about the assault. After the assault, I felt even more pressure to perform out the perfect relationship my mom wanted me to have with this man. \n\nPart of the stigma surrounding SA is that we are often not \"perfect victims\" and do not always behave in rational ways after experiencing trauma.
