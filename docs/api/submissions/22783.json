We live on the west coast so it\u2019s like a 4 hour flight. We got done with our trip and we\u2019re coming back home by plane. When we woke up he was immediately angry because I accidentally pushed him off the bed lol. Then he started finding things to complain about. I suggested we get the free breakfast with our hotel instead of going to some coffee shop and when we went he kept complaining about how the coffee is weak and he needs another one so I complied and we went to a coffee shop. We get to the airport and he\u2019s complaining more, I tell him I\u2019m tired and let me rest, don\u2019t talk to me until we get home and he gets all mad and complains. We have different seats on the plane because the flight is packed and overbooked. I tell him it\u2019s fine it\u2019s just 4 hours. He then comes to my seat and tells me the man sitting next to him is willing to trade seats with me. I literally said \u201cgive me a break\u201d and told him no. He went back crying but I just wanted a damn break. When we got home he started crying even more and said I embarrassed him on the flight.

Yeah, getting kicked off the bed sucks. Sounds like it was an accident. Get over it. It may be possible OP isn't as into him as she thinks but from what info we had, I just interpreted as she didn't want a 4hr plane ride with someone bitching and huffing and puffing the whole way.

This is unhealthy. Sure sometimes we have a hard day and everything is crappy and we are miserable. But...\n\nGood partners tell their bf/gf \"honey, i have a bad day and i don't want to ruin your mood. Enjoy your free breakfast, i will get myself a strong coffee and meet you here to go to the airport. Lets make sure we don't sit together, i would be too tempted to complain to you about everything the whole flight. Love you\"\n\nBad partners tell their gf/bf \"i have a bad day and am miserable. Just to let you know, i will not stop complaining today till i made sure your day is as miserable as mine. What do you mean we don't sit together? I insist on sitting next to you so i can continue to complain, bc if i do this to the guy next to me he will most likely give me a reason to be whiny and i don't want that and its your duty as my gf/bf to join me in my misery\". \n\nYour bf is the latter, unfortunately.\n\nEdit: don't get me wrong, if your bf would really have been suffering and that would have been the reason  of his complaining (like having a kidney stone or smthg) then i would absolutly say y t a bc he obviously needed support, but being whiney due to accidently get pushed out of bed and then the first coffee not beeing strong enough? Nah, gtfooh"]}
