My husband (32M) is Chinese and we have a son (9moM) so he would like for us both to learn Mandarin. I have only had 2 lessons so far and try to practice in my spare time whilst looking after our baby. It was my 2nd lesson today and I was so excited to show him some of the basic sentences I had learnt in the class, however, when I started speaking he rolled his eyes at me. Being a shy person, I immediately stopped speaking because I thought he was angry with me for incorrect pronunciations. Bare in mind, it is only the 2nd lesson I have ever had; my native tongue is English. He then proceeded all the way back home to shout at me asking if I had only learnt 3 words and telling me I had wasted my time and his. I am so eager to learn so I can properly communicate with my in-laws, so when he said that, I got upset and started crying, all confidence I had from my lesson completely gone.

He said I have him to talk to for practice, but he is only at home 1 day a week and even then I am too busy cooking/cleaning/raising our son.

He said I should have learnt to speak more than 3 sentences and I am pathetic for being so upset and he learnt English so I can learn Mandarin (he has been speaking English and Mandarin since childhood). So, I think I am asking, AITA for trying to defend myself after getting upset after being shouted at for not learning a language quick enough?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, I was the one who went to the GP about the postpartum psychosis and agreed to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

He is berating you and telling you that you should be hospitalized because you don't have perfect pronunciation in mandarin after two lessons.

He just talked about having you committed because you made a good point that wasn't in his favor. I'd bet money that he world make a false report to have you committed. Nope nope nope. I wouldn't trust this guy for nothing.", "NTA. Your husband sounds quite unhinged. Noone can converse in a foreign language after only two lessons. When you add to that  that is is a language with a completely different alphabet and overall structure, he should be happy if you can manage a superficial conversation after a couple of years of DAILY lessons. Also, he seems to be using your former mental health problem to put you down. If that doesn't change, I fear that your relationship doesn't have much of a future. Your husband doesn't appear to be a very nice guy overall. Don't let him walk all over you.", "NTA, He seems abusive. English is WAY easier than Mandarin, also learning languages is easier as a child. Also, it's your second lesson what did he expect in 2 lessons?", "NTA\n\nBut you have a serious spouse problem... Yelling at you because you hadn't magically achieved more than the basics of Mandarin after only two lessons, calling you pathetic, saying you should be re-sectioned AND all this while knowing you have trauma from a past abusive relationship?\n\nDoes he expect you to go to a couple of lessons and magically achieve conversational fluency in an entirely new language? Mandarin is a notoriously difficult language!\n\nHoly crap, your spouse is a major gaslighting AH.", "NTA: he has some seriously unhealthy reactions. \nI have been trying to learn Spanish for a year don't could communicate better with my spouse's family.

My spouse gives me nothing but positive reinforcement and encouragement, grace, and patience. \n\nYou ought to dump this jerk of a husband. You deserve better than that. \n\n\nAlso, English to Mandarin is extremely difficult. I would say be proud of any that you have learned!", "NTA\n\nYou are STILL in an abusive relationship.  You don't need to be sectioned, but I recommend solo counselling if you can't convince him to go as a couple.\n\nHe was VERY hostile given the circumstances.\n\nBy the way:\n\n[https://effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty/](https://effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty/)\n\nThe Foreign Service Institute puts Mandarin in its most difficult category.  It takes 2200 hours  to learn, and you have done two lessons. 3 sentences and a positive attitude are great.\n\nLanguage aptitude also varies.  Unless you score in the highest tier for the tests, a person will certainly find Mandarin very difficult to impossible to attain fluency in.\n\nThis is NOT comparable to someone who has learnt both languages since birth.  The brain maps entirely differently in these cases, and it is not uncommon to find people who are excellent at a tougher language (say Mongolian) that they have grown up speaking, yet find it hard to learn other languages of similar or less complexity (say German or English). \\[Edit: I'm not saying you CAN'T do it, just that he cannot expect you to be able to do a simple conversation after 2 lessons.\\]\n\nYour husband has anger issues, and I wonder if it's you he's critical of, or has some kind of issue at work or elsewhere making him like this.  None of what you described is reasonable.\n\nBy the way, maybe see if you can attend group classes, I think you could benefit from finding excuses to widen your social circle.", "NTA. This isn't about Mandarin. It's about browbeating you until you have no self esteem. It's less likely you'll leave him if he convinces you that you're worthless and can't do better.\n\nThis is why it's not about Mandarin: you don't need to be fluent (or even know Mandarin) for your kid to learn it. Your husband can spend more time at home and teach him if he really wants his kid to know Mandarin. You can learn as you go so you can understand him when he's old enough to talk. Your husband can also watch your kid while you take lessons, but he won't. He craps on you for not being fluent after two lessons on one of the hardest languages in the world as if that's a possible outcome. If this was about Mandarin proficiency, he'd do any of those things because they are the most reasonable solutions. He's just using this as a shitty, rather unrelated excuse to harass you.", "Sorry .. reading this sounds like you moved from one toxic relationship to another.. I\u2019d truly suggest rn that you funnel your efforts into seeking therapy and couples therapy because he sounds abusive .. 2 lessons in is not enough to expect what he is .. and he\u2019s throwing previous episodes of unrest at you which is beyond and boundary that should be set - NTA", "NTA, his reaction is awful!

If he makes excuses that he speaks/acts like that because of cultural upbringing, tell him to get bent and that's not a remotely good excuse. \n\nYou don't want to be raising a child with a parent like him. I'm part of that Asian generation where parents being unnecessarily mean and flippant in regards to children's feelings is considered normal.", "NTA \n\nHe is being emotionally abusive and honestly I would advice you to RUN.", "So you went from one toxic relationship to another. You need to get your ducks in a row and find a way to leave. Get doctors, social workers, any professionals necessary to vouch for your improvement and mental health because this guy is absolutely going to make your life hell by trying to take your kid and using your post partum psychosis against you to gain full custody. Go to a DV shelter to get more resources, and enter therapy. Talk to people who will support you and have your back. Go to support groups. Establish a solid support system. And get out.

I am currently in therapy for my post partum psychosis and have continued therapy since my ex was arrested. I can see that this is abusive from your responses, it\u2019s so easy to slip into another abusive relationship from a previous one, no excuse but for me, it was the norm.

It\u2019s a real eye opener\n\nhttps://ia800108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf", "I had advantage in that I started learning in 4th grade and it was mandatory to learn a language in middle/high school. But I didn\u2019t start getting *good* until high school because it was an immersive environment where we weren\u2019t allowed to speak English in class.\n\nI\u2019d recommend seeking out in-person immersive classes or if you have friends who speak Spanish, only speak Spanish with them (and tell them ahead of time that you want to practice). People might rag on Duolingo and other, similar, sites but it\u2019s a good way to build up your vocab and get better at writing/understanding written Spanish.\n\nWatching Spanish TV (with either Spanish or English subtitles based on your comfort level) and listening to songs in Spanish is also a good way to build up vocab and your understanding of spoken Spanish.\n\nI hope this helps!"]}
