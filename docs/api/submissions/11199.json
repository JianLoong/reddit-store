His fiances family is paying for the whole wedding and they're having it in the Bahamas. The planned a smallish wedding of 60 guests. The only person from our family he invited is our mom. This was obviously a little upsetting for myself and my siblings but we understood. We have a large family, my mom has 7 kids and has 8 siblings. You can't really have a small wedding if you invite your large family and it becomes more complicated when you start picking and choosing who in the family can come. There are no hard feelings with him deciding just to have our mom there. \n\nThe problem is my mom doesn't want to go alone for a few reasons. She has never flown before or left the country, she is very nervous for this aspect alone. She will also not know anybody at the wedding other than my brother. She's met his fiances parents and siblings but it was awkward and there's definently not a great relationship there. Her family are very rich and our family is the opposite, as a result there is a large cultural difference and my brothers future MIL said a few things that upset my mom (although I don't think she meant harm).\n\nBecause of all this my mom asked my brother if she could bring her partner of 5 years. My brother denied this. My mom assumed he had an issue with her bringing her partner specifically and then later asked if she could bring her sister to stay in her room. Not even to the wedding or reception itself but to the hotel, so she didn't have to travel alone and had someone to stay at the hotel with her as she will be in the country for 5 days. She said she'd find a way to cover the extra costs. He again denied her.\n\nAt this point I'm kind of pissed off because my mom is really upset about the whole thing. She was upset originally about none of our family being invited to the wedding and is now even more upset as she's actually scared about travelling and staying in other country basically alone. \n\nI want to confront my brother about this but my mom has told me not to. Nobody is asking him to invite anyone else to the wedding. I just want him to allow my mom to have a plus 1 so she's not all alone for a week. My uncle has already said if he doesn't allow her a guest he's just going to fly down there with her and find a cheap hotel for the week.\n\nI respect that its my brothers wedding and I shouldn't interfer but I think he's being an ass to our mom and refusing to listen to her fears about going alone. Wibta if I bring it up again and try pressure him into allowing her to bring my aunt?\n\nETA: The reason my mom is trying to get his permission to bring someone to the hotel is that all the food etc is included so and the brides family is paying. So she would have to organise paying him back.", "created_utc": 1677673556, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f2hfu/wibta_if_i_confront_my_brother_about_his_wedding/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's so weird. \n\nHonestly if your mom isn't allowed to bring another person to the wedding she should just bring a friend for the rest of the weekend anyways and they can be with her outside of the actual wedding.

You can talk to him about how you and sibs would like to be included in some way in this step in his life, even if it's not going to what is obviously her wedding.", "YWBTA simply because your mother has asked you not to intervene.

A wedding is supposed to be with your loved ones, for you brother that obviously means only you mom, which in itself is bad enough, but to not even let a single additional person attend it when his mother has such issues, that is straight up evil in my opinion.

I may be overthinking this, but as she comes from a wealthy family, she might just be very spoiled.", "OP, come on! Tell your mother to not go to the wedding, the end.

I get wanting a small wedding, but the decisions your brother is making are completely AH-ish. She's going to be flying for the first time, leaving the country for the first time, and going to the other country for the first time. That's a lot to handle. I fly domestically yearly and even I haven't done it alone yet. It's scary! She has every right to be nervous and want someone for emotional support. If your brother doesn't allow that, she can either get creative (like the uncle paying for a cheap room) or refuse to go.\n\nHowever, I still don't think you should involve yourself until after it's over.
