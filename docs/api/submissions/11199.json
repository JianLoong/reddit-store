His fiances family is paying for the whole wedding and they're having it in the Bahamas. The planned a smallish wedding of 60 guests. The only person from our family he invited is our mom. This was obviously a little upsetting for myself and my siblings but we understood. We have a large family, my mom has 7 kids and has 8 siblings. You can't really have a small wedding if you invite your large family and it becomes more complicated when you start picking and choosing who in the family can come. There are no hard feelings with him deciding just to have our mom there. \n\nThe problem is my mom doesn't want to go alone for a few reasons. She has never flown before or left the country, she is very nervous for this aspect alone. She will also not know anybody at the wedding other than my brother. She's met his fiances parents and siblings but it was awkward and there's definently not a great relationship there. Her family are very rich and our family is the opposite, as a result there is a large cultural difference and my brothers future MIL said a few things that upset my mom (although I don't think she meant harm).\n\nBecause of all this my mom asked my brother if she could bring her partner of 5 years. My brother denied this. My mom assumed he had an issue with her bringing her partner specifically and then later asked if she could bring her sister to stay in her room. Not even to the wedding or reception itself but to the hotel, so she didn't have to travel alone and had someone to stay at the hotel with her as she will be in the country for 5 days. She said she'd find a way to cover the extra costs. He again denied her.\n\nAt this point I'm kind of pissed off because my mom is really upset about the whole thing. She was upset originally about none of our family being invited to the wedding and is now even more upset as she's actually scared about travelling and staying in other country basically alone. \n\nI want to confront my brother about this but my mom has told me not to. Nobody is asking him to invite anyone else to the wedding. I just want him to allow my mom to have a plus 1 so she's not all alone for a week. My uncle has already said if he doesn't allow her a guest he's just going to fly down there with her and find a cheap hotel for the week.\n\nI respect that its my brothers wedding and I shouldn't interfer but I think he's being an ass to our mom and refusing to listen to her fears about going alone. Wibta if I bring it up again and try pressure him into allowing her to bring my aunt?\n\nETA: The reason my mom is trying to get his permission to bring someone to the hotel is that all the food etc is included so and the brides family is paying. So she would have to organise paying him back.", "created_utc": 1677673556, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f2hfu/wibta_if_i_confront_my_brother_about_his_wedding/", "score": 298, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's so weird. \n\nHonestly if your mom isn't allowed to bring another person to the wedding she should just bring a friend for the rest of the weekend anyways and they can be with her outside of the actual wedding.

If that\u2019s the case, AND your brother is so adamant about no one else even helping his own mother, it sounds like he\u2019s trying to cut you all out of his life. Or his bride is trying to cut you all out of his life. Whether you\u2019re the asshole or not, sometimes doing the right thing means being one. And if your mother is truly afraid, maybe she\u2019s not using the right words to make your brother understand.

It\u2019s insane that he won\u2019t even let someone stay in a hotel room with her, which wouldn\u2019t even add any additional cost. Not to mention the indignity of staying in the room and then being denied from the wedding. \n\nAnd if the bride\u2019s family are rich, then what\u2019s the issue with having a plus one?

Second, because \" confronting\" is unlikely to have a good outcome. Talk to your brother about ways to make your mom more comfortable going. Or maybe suggest a lower key celebration after the wedding for your side of the family.  You can talk to him about how you and sibs would like to be included in some way in this step in his life, even if it's not going to what is obviously her wedding.", "YWBTA simply because your mother has asked you not to intervene.

Just show up and ruin their plans.", "NTA. A wedding is supposed to be with your loved ones, for you brother that obviously means only you mom, which in itself is bad enough, but to not even let a single additional person attend it when his mother has such issues, that is straight up evil in my opinion. The hell is wrong with the dude? His soon to be wife is probably forcing him to do this, she expects this event to be only about her and the man standing next to him is just a prop for her big day. I may be overthinking this, but as she comes from a wealthy family, she might just be very spoiled.", "OP, come on! Tell your mother to not go to the wedding, the end.

Such uncaring nature toward his own mother, feel bad for the future wife tbh.", "ywbta. don't fight your moms battle against her explicit will. it'll probably only make things worse. however, maybe you can get your mother's permission to express your oppinion. then i'd say it's okay and it seems your brother needs to hear it.", "NTA. I get wanting a small wedding, but the decisions your brother is making are completely AH-ish. She's going to be flying for the first time, leaving the country for the first time, and going to the other country for the first time. That's a lot to handle. I fly domestically yearly and even I haven't done it alone yet. It's scary! She has every right to be nervous and want someone for emotional support. If your brother doesn't allow that, she can either get creative (like the uncle paying for a cheap room) or refuse to go.\n\nHowever, I still don't think you should involve yourself until after it's over. He could rescind the invitation, which might be against your mother's final decision on whether she'll go.

Siblings should have been invited", "NTA.  It sounds like your brother doesn't want any of his family there, but has to invite someone, so he picked your mom hoping she would back out.  Now, why did he do that?  I'm just going to assume his fiance put him up to it because of the financial/cultural diversity between the two families.  \n\nIf I was in your shoes, I would confront my brother about this.  Something is wrong here.", "I agree with uncle.  He can go as a travel companion & do his own thing. Your brother cannot control who flies with your ma to the Bahamas.\n\nDoes your mom \\*at least\\* get her own room.  I don't understand why mom & uncle can't share the own room, it should make much of a difference of 1person in a room vs 2, even in an all-inclusive (often there is an upcharge for 1p/room, so whats the big fucking deal?)\n\nI would encourage mom to take uncle and not tell anyone.  Since she doesn't want to \"make waves\", uncle can find another lodging option.  HOWEVER, I suspect that mom will be sharing a room with a stranger & anything she does other than be meek&silent will be seen as a huge offensive thing. Basically, you mom is gonna end up in the doghouse no matter what.  She is already, just by asking for a travel companion.  He is manipulating the situation to not have any of your family there, including your mom.\n\nYour brother is a huge asshole.  I would bet dollars to donuts that he has a poor-me story going,  so any travel companion will raise questions and/or look bad.", "NTA. \n\nSure, people can invite whoever they want to their weddings, but that has consequences. \n\nYour mother's request of at least bringing a person with her- not to the wedding- is very reasonable. She doesn't want to travel alone which is valid regardless of the reasons, and the fact this would be a big new thing for her is even more reason why she should be able to bring someone. \n\nThen, out of 60 people, your brother only has space for one family member? I'm sorry, but that's absurd. Your mother should be able to bring a plus one to his actual wedding, and certainly to travel with her. \n\nI think you should sit down with your mother and ask her what she wants to do and how you agree with her and support her. But, if at the end of the day she doesn't want you to confront your brother, I think you should respect her wishes. After the wedding, you can certainly raise it because you get to have your own feelings about how he treats your mom, but this is your mother's problem to solve right now and if she doesn't want to make a fuss, then don't do it against her wished. AFTER, go for it and tell your brother all the ways he is an AH for not giving two shits about his mother's comfort at his wedding.", "NTA - this is a super weird dynamic and makes no sense. Rich family paying for whole Bahamas wedding but only 1 guest on the grooms side?", "I think your mum should just not go, 60 guests but only your mum? This is quite odd. I feel like there is some back story here, and I don\u2019t think pressuring your brother is the answer. Either he\u2019s being cut off from his family, or he\u2019s cutting you guys out", "NTA\u2026but I would stay out of it.  But why in the world is your mom not allowed a plus one?  I hate to say it, but this seems clear how this relationship between your brother, his new wife and your mom is going to be in the future.  I wonder if brother is embarrassed because mom is not rich like wife\u2019s family?  Honestly, if I was mom, I would decline to attend.  There is no valid reason that she should not have a plus one.   And honestly, if your mother is paying, (or whomever), for an extra person in her hotel room, all expenses incurred while they are there, not attending the wedding or reception, it is not up to your brother to have a say on if she brings someone else for support.", "It's horrible that he has denied her taking someone with her and that she is the only one of your family to be 'allowed' to attend is very worrying.  Yes, the bride's family are paying and certainly get a say in the wedding arrangements but to only allow one person from his side is an AH move and very odd. Surprising he would want it like that - it's his wedding too!", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m confused about the part with all the food being included at the hotel and the brides parents paying. Have they bought out the entire hotel for this event? Is it all inclusive? How big is this place? How can they refuse other guests at a hotel??? I can see the wedding/reception but not an entire hotel. Mom should be able to take anyone she pleases along!", "I know it would upset your mom not to go, but I wouldn't go if I were her. Let your brother deal with it. It sounds like your brother has a new family. You lost a brother. My condolences.", "NTA.

Only your mom is invited?", "Nta, personally If he wants to cut off his family now he\u2019s got a rich one I\u2019d leave him to it.", "NTA not allowing your mom to even have one person with her is wrong", "I would book a trip to the same hotel with all my brothers and sisters. Mom can still attend the wedding and be on vaca with the rest of the family. It sounds like an all inclusive hotel and nothing private! Cut your losses on the bro, he belongs to the soon to be wife now.", "NTA for being upset but there is more here. This is either his fiance has put lots of thoughts in his head and slowly gaining control to end his family relationships or there was a lot of toxicity with your family growing up. He is either being manipulated gaslit by fiance or is planning on cutting you guys off or both. I'm sorry", "NTA but your mother is a grown up and you need to respect her asking you not to interfere. Your brother sucks for excluding his family but there's not much you can do about it. Let your mom handle it.", "NTA: But don't CONFRONT your brother. Call him up and calmly ask him what he is thinking. Explain again that Mom is nervous. Explain that having a plus one means he won't have to spend time worrying about mom. Ask him if what he really wants is for Mom not to go either? Make it all questions. Tell him how excited you are for him and how you understand about the small wedding. Be cool. You can't confront or tell Mom to stay away until you have all the facts.", "NTA. I'd be asking brother to confirm if mom actually HAS been invited or if he's just saying she is and hoping she declines.", "Tbh when any of your sibling marry you people should not invite this AH brother and his wife.

He can't even compromise little for his mom??  i know I'm being rude but this is so shit situation.", "OP, I think you\u2019re whole family should go to the Bahamas and treat it as a family vacation. Obviously, you won\u2019t be going to the wedding since you weren\u2019t invited (which is completely ridiculous btw). This way you can enjoy some time together and hopefully turn a painful memory into a happy one while making your brother and his in-laws look like complete AH\u2019s. Win-win", "ESH.   You should butt out. or confront your brother for excluding you!  Your mom should handle her own arrangements and relationship.  \n\n60 is not a small wedding imo and your family is deliberately excluded.  Your brother either plans to leave you all behind , or he\u2019s in some sort of abusive relationship.

If he is being forced to isolate from his family for a reason? Does he need any help. That you are there for him.\n\nSee where that goes.\n\nMy bet is that he and/or his fiance don't want his poor family to mingle with her rich one.\n\nNTA for wanting to help your mom.", "Anyone else think that the reason they won't give your Mom a plus one is that they are trying to discourage her from going on the trip?  You are NTA but your brother's new family is.", "It\u2019s a small 60 person wedding but he only gets to invite 1 person from his family? How does that work? NTA and ti be honest if I was your mum, I would refuse to go.", "NTA - what groom only invites one person from his whole family to his wedding?", "NTA if you were to speak up, but it sounds like your uncle has proposed a solution? Assuming that's acceptable to your mother, leave it to the two of them to figure out. Having a destination wedding and only inviting the wealthy family and friends of the bride says a lot about your brother - I doubt your words will carry much weight with him if his own mother has tried and failed.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother is clearly ashamed of his family. No one invites 60 people from only one side of the two families to the Bahamas to have a small wedding.\n\nIt's a real pity for your mother, but I think she ought to consider not going herself. It's got nothing to do with wanting a small wedding--it's to do with wanting a wedding attended only by the \"right kind\" of people. Your mother would be stuck somewhere out of the way and in effect told to not make herself very visible. Your brother will explain to the other guests that sadly none of his family members could attend the wedding, and will garner some sympathy from his in-laws' guests about how cheap and tacky his family is for not be willing to spend a little bit of money to jet out to the islands. \n\nYou all should get used to the idea that you will no longer have any meaningful relationship with your brother. He's much more comfortable in his new world without awkward reminders of where he came from. When he eventually gets divorced and comes back to you all full of brotherly love and family loyalty, etc., you should remember his attitude now and tell him to stick it.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry your brother and his bride are so petty.", "Nta. Your brother is for letting his fianc\u00e9 and family exclude your family from the wedding and your brothe is a p o s for letting it happen.", "Something is going on here in my opinion. Only invited mom from grooms side and then making it practically impossible for mom to attend... really sounds like he doesn't WANT mom to attend...\n\nYou should honestly talk to your mom, like a REAL sit down/hard truths kind of talk. Maybe SHE needs to be backing out, perhaps it would give your brother the balls enough to stand up for his mom against the finances family, or show his true colors and accept it with no fight... it's all very tricky, but something is definitely not right. \n\nI really want to say N-T-A BUT it is your mom's situation technically, so if SHE doesn't want you to call and get involved, it would probably be best if you didn't and instead worked on it from mom's side (talking to her).", "Something is fishy here. 60 guests, only 1 of your side of the family? If you don't see the message send by your \"brother\" then I am really sorry for this but: He doesn't want you there. It's as simple as that. This is his message telling you that he does not see you as family, does not care for you and if you dissapeared out of his life he wouldn't care for a second.\n\nIt's time to have a talk with your mom. Does she really want to go to a son that doesn't even see his own sibblings as family? She should be insanely mad at your brother for even thinking of inviting 60 people over that do not include his sibblings. \n\nUnless, there is something you're not telling us. But seeing your brothers behaviour he seems to be a straight up AH. So I am guessing there's not much more than that.\n\nYou don't need to talk to your brother, actually, you should never talk to him again. The disrespect this man has for his family asks for being disowned and being NC'd by everyone.\n\nEdit: I forgot my NTA here as I think you shouldn't care about his wedding for a second. Stick up for your mother and talk to her. Make her realize the ways of her son are wrong.", "NTA your mom is expected to travel all alone? i thought a wedding was about familys coming together, this sounds more like your family is being cut out. suggest mom stay home with the rest of the groom's family and have a nice get together when they get back", "Kind of reminds me of my sister's wedding.  She wanted a small gathering,  nothing expensive.  So we had it at our parents' house.  My parents don't drink,  neither does my system.   My Bil does a little,  but I've never seen him drink.  His family does though.  Probably 50 people came in total.  It was nice,  but his family obviously didn't enjoy themselves,  as they sat together and avoided talking to the rest of us.\n\nAfter few weeks afterwards they got together to give them a \"real\" party,  which of course no one from my family was invited.  Turns out was an excuse to get blackout drunk while talking shit on my family and my sister's wedding.   From what i understand, she thanked them for the party,  but politely told them to fuck it.  As far as I'm aware,  they have little to no contract with any of them now.", "They don't want to invite any of these 'peasants' would me my guess, they just invited mum to not come off as *complete* assholes (and failed anyway). Understandably 8 people is a lot but there isn't any reason why she cant have a plus one. They invited 60 people from their own side!", "Yeah, it looks like they are trying to Markle the poor relations. \n\n 'Being Meghan Markled': a 'verb for ghosting or disposing of people once you have no use or benefit from them anymore, without regard to genuine human relationship'.", "Yeah, this is weird. They are deffo gonna get cut off after this. \n\nI would say that either the mom goes with a plus one or not at all. Bride's family might lose face if OP'S mom is not there.", "And dude no \u201crich\u201d family throws a wedding and cuts out the other family to one attendee and then tries to charge them for a plus one.

It is sort of thing that alters relationships forever. Which is fine if there is history of abuse and so on, be pretty cruel otherwise.", "That\u2019s what they\u2019re attempting to do. I guess to mitigate costs, the mom asked if her guest could stay in her room but not attend the wedding and the son wouldn\u2019t agree to that either.", ">After the wedding, you can certainly raise it because you get to have your own feelings about how he treats your mom\n\nYou also get to have feelings about how he just ditched the entire family, including you. OOP is being unreasonably tolerant about that in my opinion. As for me, I would inform him that you are what you do, and if you behave like a stranger and not like a member of the family at all, a stranger is what you are, regardless of who your parents happen to be. But I agree that it would be best to wait until after the wedding.", "So many options..... AH bride/her family having issues with them all coming (the wealth subtext makes me think they're snobs who don't trust OP's side to \"behave\").

NAH groom where everyone else is paying their way but he doesn't think his family can afford it so trying to find a pay to get his mom there..... and AH groom where he picked a wedding knowing his family couldn't attend bc aesthetics/over family (though I think the verdict there would be divided on the sub)", "Just as likely (if not somewhat more likely) that it is actually the groom\u2019s choice.", "Haha, ok, I am glad that this is the very first comment I saw after reading OP's story and scrolling down.

My parents would have been fish out of water if I had the wedding of either of my sister in laws - hell, their 10k dresses alone would have given my mother a heart attack from the anxiety of being poor around that kind of wealth. \n\nIf he cared or had the space to care, he would have fought harder to have his family come, even if it meant catering more to their needs.", "I have no memory of him being parentified but I was only 5 when he moved out at 17 (navy then college).
