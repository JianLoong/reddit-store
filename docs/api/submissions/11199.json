His fiances family is paying for the whole wedding and they're having it in the Bahamas. The planned a smallish wedding of 60 guests. The only person from our family he invited is our mom. This was obviously a little upsetting for myself and my siblings but we understood. We have a large family, my mom has 7 kids and has 8 siblings. You can't really have a small wedding if you invite your large family and it becomes more complicated when you start picking and choosing who in the family can come. There are no hard feelings with him deciding just to have our mom there. \n\nThe problem is my mom doesn't want to go alone for a few reasons. She has never flown before or left the country, she is very nervous for this aspect alone. She will also not know anybody at the wedding other than my brother. She's met his fiances parents and siblings but it was awkward and there's definently not a great relationship there. Her family are very rich and our family is the opposite, as a result there is a large cultural difference and my brothers future MIL said a few things that upset my mom (although I don't think she meant harm).\n\nBecause of all this my mom asked my brother if she could bring her partner of 5 years. My brother denied this. My mom assumed he had an issue with her bringing her partner specifically and then later asked if she could bring her sister to stay in her room. Not even to the wedding or reception itself but to the hotel, so she didn't have to travel alone and had someone to stay at the hotel with her as she will be in the country for 5 days. She said she'd find a way to cover the extra costs. He again denied her.\n\nAt this point I'm kind of pissed off because my mom is really upset about the whole thing. She was upset originally about none of our family being invited to the wedding and is now even more upset as she's actually scared about travelling and staying in other country basically alone. \n\nI want to confront my brother about this but my mom has told me not to. Nobody is asking him to invite anyone else to the wedding. I just want him to allow my mom to have a plus 1 so she's not all alone for a week. My uncle has already said if he doesn't allow her a guest he's just going to fly down there with her and find a cheap hotel for the week.\n\nI respect that its my brothers wedding and I shouldn't interfer but I think he's being an ass to our mom and refusing to listen to her fears about going alone. Wibta if I bring it up again and try pressure him into allowing her to bring my aunt?\n\nETA: The reason my mom is trying to get his permission to bring someone to the hotel is that all the food etc is included so and the brides family is paying. So she would have to organise paying him back.", "created_utc": 1677673556, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f2hfu/wibta_if_i_confront_my_brother_about_his_wedding/", "score": 1934, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If that\u2019s the case, AND your brother is so adamant about no one else even helping his own mother, it sounds like he\u2019s trying to cut you all out of his life. Or his bride is trying to cut you all out of his life. Whether you\u2019re the asshole or not, sometimes doing the right thing means being one. And if your mother is truly afraid, maybe she\u2019s not using the right words to make your brother understand.

It\u2019s insane that he won\u2019t even let someone stay in a hotel room with her, which wouldn\u2019t even add any additional cost.

Second, because \" confronting\" is unlikely to have a good outcome. Talk to your brother about ways to make your mom more comfortable going.

You can talk to him about how you and sibs would like to be included in some way in this step in his life, even if it's not going to what is obviously her wedding.", "YWBTA simply because your mother has asked you not to intervene.

A wedding is supposed to be with your loved ones, for you brother that obviously means only you mom, which in itself is bad enough, but to not even let a single additional person attend it when his mother has such issues, that is straight up evil in my opinion. The hell is wrong with the dude? His soon to be wife is probably forcing him to do this, she expects this event to be only about her and the man standing next to him is just a prop for her big day. I may be overthinking this, but as she comes from a wealthy family, she might just be very spoiled.", "OP, come on! Tell your mother to not go to the wedding, the end.

I get wanting a small wedding, but the decisions your brother is making are completely AH-ish. She's going to be flying for the first time, leaving the country for the first time, and going to the other country for the first time. That's a lot to handle. I fly domestically yearly and even I haven't done it alone yet. It's scary! She has every right to be nervous and want someone for emotional support. If your brother doesn't allow that, she can either get creative (like the uncle paying for a cheap room) or refuse to go.\n\nHowever, I still don't think you should involve yourself until after it's over. He could rescind the invitation, which might be against your mother's final decision on whether she'll go.

There\u2019s got to be another element to this. Insist on a straight talk with your brother. Maybe do a zoom with him and his fianc\u00e9e present, I wonder if she knows about this. NTA. Do some digging.", "So your brother's fianc\u00e9 gets 59 guests, and your brother gets 1? Unless there's some family trauma there that's pretty crappy.\n\nBut your brother doesn't get to decide who can fly on planes, visit that country and stay in the hotel. So your mom doesn't need to ask, she can just bring someone.", "NTA.\nI\u2019m sorry\u2026 so wedding of 60 guests and your brother got\u20261.\nOne whole guest, that\u2019s messed up.", "NTA! \n\nSo, this might be a little \"about me\" but, I will keep it short. My cousin's new wife pulled a dick move like this... the same excuse, \"we can only invite so many people because of the number of meals, etc.\" So, some of my family was invited some weren't. My sister was invited but her children weren't (13f and 10f). I was invited and so were my kids, my other sister was invited and so were her kids, my brother, and his wife was invited and so were 3 of their 5 kids. Then, there was the rehearsal dinner. I was an out-of-town guest. My Mom was invited, but I wasn't. And then...the cherry on the cake, the \"family table\" where ALL of the family except my sister, my daughter (15F), and I were seated. We were seated out with everyone else who wasn't family. All my cousins, aunts, Uncles, (the bride doesn't have extended family) everyone who was related to my cousin was at that table....even HIS FRIENDS. Except for my sister and I and my daughter. We were the only three family members, and people knew it. I was PISSED. I am still pissed. That card with money in it stayed in my purse. I didn't give it to them. (I am SUPER petty.) I learned my lesson. If there are problems BEFORE the wedding...DO NOT GO TO THE WEDDING!!! \n\nTell your Mom to make excuses and DO NOT go. It will just end up causing more heartache in the long run.", "You brother is an ass. I get they want a small wedding but your brother got one guest out of 60?  Don't waste your words. If someone wants to fly to the Bahamas with your mom and stay in another hotel He can't do squat about it.", "Hmmm, call the hotel and ask what the cost of a plus one staying in your mom\u2019s room.  Then figure out who\u2019s credit card it will go on.  Same with plane ticket.  Nobody needs your brother\u2019s permission to travel with your mom if brother is not paying for it.  This will need to be top secret.\n\nClearly NTA but your brother is and I doubt anyone will be able to reason with him.  I\u2019m really sorry your mom has to go through this.", "NTA. But this isn't about them not being able to afford the grooms side of the family. This is a \"we don't want poor people at our wedding embarrassing us\" situation. It looks like your brother is at worst ashamed of you all or at best his wife is ashamed of you all and he doesn't have the spine to stand up for his family.", "This is so weird.  Please please please update us if you figure it out.", "NTA - your brother is", "nta, a single senior woman alone in a strange land? (I don't mean this in a bad way, I just feel it might be more dangerous for her is what I mean). Yeah no. I love your uncle, just find a cheap hotel and fly down on his own.", "So the brides family is allowing your brother to have ONE SINGLE GUEST AT HIS OWN WEDDING?\n\nThat marriage is definitely NOT going to last.\n\nAnd I would definitely NOT let my mother travel alone out of the country for this.\n\nThat is ridiculous. NTA", "YWBTA if you confront your brother.  Your mom WNBTA if she nopes out due to the restriction on having a travel buddy.", "YWNBTA: NTA: Bring the bride into the conversation. Her reaction will tell you the answers to all the possible reasons that there could be for such a crappy way to treat your mother.", "NTA, your brother or rather his fianc\u00e9 is unreasonable. Your mother should simply skip the wedding. It\u2019s clear that\u2019s what is happening here. He doesn\u2019t want her there and is hoping that making her so inconvenienced or feel so out of place and nervous that she chooses not to go.", "Absolutely NTA. I just had similar happen to my family. Uncle (my mums 1st cousin so he is my uncle) comfortable with money. Close to family. Majority of the family lives in one small town. No one is dirt poor but no one is on his level with money. They slowly started having \u2018friends\u2019 parties and \u2018family\u2019 parties. We got used to it. But last week, his daughter had an engagement party and he only invited his mom and dad. Not even his brother! Not my mum, no one. And he let his mother sit with some strangers (my sisters fianc\u00e9\u2019s distant cousins). I am out of the country so of course I wasn\u2019t invited. I already started to make plans for the wedding. I cried when she got engaged. And now we know the date and no one wants to go. Every single person said \u2018if he invited at least some of the main family and not the rest it\u2019s ok.\u2019 But he invited only his mum? She raised him, she gave him money to start businesses, they made her wear an outfit she was uncomfortable in and she cried that night. It\u2019s way too weird and made everyone so uncomfortable", "It\u2019s his mom, brother likely knew she would be uncomfortable flying to another country alone and being around strangers..we tend to know these types of things about our moms. He did this shit on purpose bc he doesn\u2019t want her there, but didn\u2019t want the shame of outright not inviting her. Poor lady, I can\u2019t imagine how hurtful that would be. NTA.", "NTA and this sounds sus. 60 guests and 58 people are from the wife\u2019s family. Maybe the money disparity between your family and his wife\u2019s is in play here. Your mom should not go.", "No. F your brother and tell him that if he is going to let his wife run his life this much at this point, he may as well skip the wedding too.", "From some additional context, YWBTA if you 'confront' him.\n\nFor whatever reason (and you don't know the reason), he's making it deliberately difficult for anyone in your family to attend his wedding. Maybe he had a hard time growing up and wants to go LC / NC, maybe he's a gold-gigging AH, but you don't seem to have the facts OP - and therefore shouldn't really get involved, and certainly shouldn't go on the attack (which 'confront' implies).\n\nA calm conversation with him about this, coming from a place of \"I just want to understand what's going on; maybe we can work together to avoid some of the unecessary drama even if you want to go NC?\" might be helpful. But if you're not confident you can stay on that track, best not to say anything at all.", "Your brother is an asshole. He's excluding his family and forcing his mother into a very uncomfortable situation. I used to photograph elopements in Yosemite. People flew in from around the country and the world. Never once have I seen a family excluded like this. It was very typical to have just immediate family, parents, siblings, spouses, and grandparents. BOTH SIDES. Sometimes it was just both sets of parents. \nFrom my experience, it seems they want this lavish, expensive wedding and don't want to pay for your family. And they're insulting your entire family. Talk to your brother, but expect it to go very badly. He will gaslight you.", "i\u2019m confused isn\u2019t it your bothers wedding and only person being invited from your family. either no one gets along and he\u2019s making excuses or there\u2019s more to story", "Isn't isolating one from ones family a sign of abusive behavior?", "Bride's family is a bunch of jerks throwing the wedding for themselves alone. Doubt you will see the happy couple very often", "Agreed, this whole thing is very strange. NTA", "Dude is marrying up and away from that shitty, poor person life of his. He\u2019s ashamed of his family and will never really want to see them again.\n\nOf course in due time he\u2019ll figure out that what he actually hates is himself, or he\u2019ll think he\u2019s a fraud, and become miserable but that\u2019s for a later day.\n\n\nOP your brother is the A here, but there\u2019s no point in you starting the fight.", "Rich people totally do this. It's not about money it's about power and/or control", "Is the fiancee making your brother pay equally for each additional guest of his?\n\nIf so, that's horrible, he should've pushed for something more affordable if he wanted some more family there. Unless he didnt, which is another story", "I'm leaning toward this as well. My upper middle class cousin married the only child of someone ultra-rich. He had less than 10 guests at a 200 guest wedding. They were so worried we'd embarrass them that they rented tuxes for the men and sent all the women to an approved salon to get our hair done. None of us were in the wedding party at all and only his parents were in their photos. I think his mom had to get her dress approved. We were also served last so our foot was lukewarm. Our table was in a corner as far away from the dance floor, etc as possible.", "I have. Not only have I seen an only sightly better version of this in my own family, but there was a post not too long ago (can't remember if it was reddit or where i saw it) where they gave everyone wristbands for the food. Poor family got cold cuts and the family who paid got more typical wedding fare.", "NTA. He\u2019s a towering piece of something smelly. He only invited one? Who only invites one family member! Oh Markle! Maybe he\u2019s paying for his family and could only afford one.\n\nIt\u2019s a real kick in the teeth. He could always use the money saved from her flight and room and get someone to livestream it back to you, whereupon you could all bare your backsides and livestream that back!", "...you know that's what \"all but one\" means, right?... \n\nThey're excluding ALL (the people) BUT (except) ONE (who is not excluded in the all)", "Just thinking of that!!", "Actual \u201ccultured\u201d people would absolutely never invite the mother of the groom without a plus one/escort.", "I've seen some Say Yes to the Dress episode clips on Facebook where women are buying like 23k designer dresses, walking in the door saying they have an unlimited budget and the wedding is like 100k+", "lol considering that dress cost more than my entire wedding did, yeah, My head is spinning", "I think he\u2019s implying that she\u2019s been INVITED, but they don\u2019t want or expect her to actually attend. He\u2019s  being sarcastic.", "The only catch is that there may be only one bed and they can't ask for a cot or whatever, so that's awkward even if it's your brother who's with you.", "I agree. And would probably be shocked that more family isn\u2019t invited. \n\nI think they are either rich snobs or the groom is ashamed of his family", "Particularly if she's the ONLY family member invited.", "I agree with this: brother / WTB are clearly doing everything possible to prevent Mum from attending; and it sounds like OP isn't close enough to him to definitively know why.\n\nSo the best approach is a calm \"please help me understand, let's find a way forward without all of this drama\" conversation. (Or staying out of it entirely.)", "probably wasn't planned (or maybe it was) but $69 nice", "Try over 2 years for a refund and no passport from another country!", "They're mooches. They also casually inflated their wedding bills so they could take home an extra $20k for themselves.", "That's a stereotype. There are people that happens to, but there are people it doesn't. There's a reason the Scrooge archetype rings so true in stories. Everyone knows the rich person who can't be bothered to spend an extra 10 bucks for their employees comfort by raising the heat or buying a better office chair.", "Nah. If I got rich NOW. earlier in life? Sure. My grandpa was broke growing up, got rich, is miserly.", "Now that is definitely mooching. If dad was happy giving them money they wouldn\u2019t have been cheating him. Hopefully dad wakes up to their greedy ways one of these days."]}
