We had never been super close up until 2020. Janet has always had some sort of disability, the most prominent being an autoimmune disorder that causes chronic pain. Janet is also very prominent on social media, and often discusses her disabilities very openly. I am not, and haven\u2019t really discussed mine in length. \n\nRecently, I have been afflicted by really bad pains in my hands due to my job. I expressed how badly things had gotten when I found myself physically incapable of using my left hand for the most basic of tasks, such as picking up a pencil, or waving. I told Janet about it, as she is a friend, and she was sympathetic. But then, less than 24 hours later, I went onto her social media and I found her crying to her followers about her own \u201cchronic hand pain.\u201d I was kind of dumbfounded, since she had just been with me the day before opening jars and carrying around things with no pain or complaints. I decided to let this go and believe that she may in fact be suffering like I am because, how do I know if she hasn\u2019t been dealing with this? But then it started getting weird.\n\nJanet started asking me more and more questions. What the pain feels like, how frequently, does it shoot to other places or was it localized, etc. At first, I didn\u2019t think anything of it and answered her\u2026 only for her to have the same type of pain less than 24 hours later! I was shocked that she would say that she had the same level and type of pain as me, even using the same terminology I did. I decided to stop answering her questions, and for a couple months, she stuck with what she had already told her following. Until last night. \n\nAfter a few visits with my doctor, my pain is gone, thankfully. The only thing that is gone for good is the grip strength I once had, but I just have to cope with it and manage. Janet called me last night and I, stupidly, told her that my pain is gone and explained my grip strength issues. Can you guess what happened next?\n\nThis morning, less than 12 hours later, Janet posted a 20 minute sob fest on social media regarding her \u201cgrip strength,\u201d and how she is going to have to cope with it leaving her. I watched as she dramatically let tears fall down her face while discussing how she can\u2019t do basic tasks anymore. Frustrated, I texted Janet and told her to stop mimicking my very painful condition and using my symptoms as her own for her following and for attention. She wrote back that I was an asshole for suggesting she was doing that, and then ran to her social media to state that a friend thinks she\u2019s faking and how hurt she is. \n\nAt first, I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but after her symptoms mirrored mine so quickly, it was suspicious. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit for clarity: I do not know what kind of autoimmune disorder she has or if that is a contributing factor to her pain. She told me that she has not been tested, but she feels she has one, she just doesn\u2019t know which one. I didn\u2019t ask further questions because it\u2019s not my business. \nI also do not discount any pain she has, as I stated, I first was sympathetic with her because I was not going to assume that she was not experiencing things. However, the only time it was brought up was when I had expressed something about mine to her, either good or bad. And this has gone on since late October, so it\u2019s not a snap judgement kind of deal.", "created_utc": 1675096440, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p76l1/aita_for_telling_my_friend_to_stop_mimicking_my/", "score": 166, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
