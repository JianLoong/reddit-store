We had never been super close up until 2020. Janet has always had some sort of disability, the most prominent being an autoimmune disorder that causes chronic pain. Janet is also very prominent on social media, and often discusses her disabilities very openly. I am not, and haven\u2019t really discussed mine in length. \n\nRecently, I have been afflicted by really bad pains in my hands due to my job. I expressed how badly things had gotten when I found myself physically incapable of using my left hand for the most basic of tasks, such as picking up a pencil, or waving. I told Janet about it, as she is a friend, and she was sympathetic. But then, less than 24 hours later, I went onto her social media and I found her crying to her followers about her own \u201cchronic hand pain.\u201d I was kind of dumbfounded, since she had just been with me the day before opening jars and carrying around things with no pain or complaints. I decided to let this go and believe that she may in fact be suffering like I am because, how do I know if she hasn\u2019t been dealing with this? But then it started getting weird.\n\nJanet started asking me more and more questions. What the pain feels like, how frequently, does it shoot to other places or was it localized, etc. At first, I didn\u2019t think anything of it and answered her\u2026 only for her to have the same type of pain less than 24 hours later! I was shocked that she would say that she had the same level and type of pain as me, even using the same terminology I did. I decided to stop answering her questions, and for a couple months, she stuck with what she had already told her following. Until last night. \n\nAfter a few visits with my doctor, my pain is gone, thankfully. The only thing that is gone for good is the grip strength I once had, but I just have to cope with it and manage. Janet called me last night and I, stupidly, told her that my pain is gone and explained my grip strength issues. Can you guess what happened next?\n\nThis morning, less than 12 hours later, Janet posted a 20 minute sob fest on social media regarding her \u201cgrip strength,\u201d and how she is going to have to cope with it leaving her. I watched as she dramatically let tears fall down her face while discussing how she can\u2019t do basic tasks anymore. Frustrated, I texted Janet and told her to stop mimicking my very painful condition and using my symptoms as her own for her following and for attention. She wrote back that I was an asshole for suggesting she was doing that, and then ran to her social media to state that a friend thinks she\u2019s faking and how hurt she is. \n\nAt first, I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but after her symptoms mirrored mine so quickly, it was suspicious. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit for clarity: I do not know what kind of autoimmune disorder she has or if that is a contributing factor to her pain. She told me that she has not been tested, but she feels she has one, she just doesn\u2019t know which one. I didn\u2019t ask further questions because it\u2019s not my business. \nI also do not discount any pain she has, as I stated, I first was sympathetic with her because I was not going to assume that she was not experiencing things. However, the only time it was brought up was when I had expressed something about mine to her, either good or bad.

You better stop talking to her about things you don't want to see in social media all together if you want to stay \"friends\" (she isn't a true friend anyway or she wouldn't use your exact words without your consent).\n\nNTA.", "NTA and stop talking about your health to Janet.", "Nta. And she is not your friend", "NTA - also, she's not your friend. Know when someone is using you for their own ends (in her case attention).", "NTA. I've been in your position and the friend milked it for years on social media. Claimed benefits, got a better house, posted constantly. Went from no issues but asking me how my disability started and progressed  to suddenly not being able to do anything and using every scheme available to get free things she thought proved she had the condition.  \n Several friends saw how closely she was mimicking and how unlikely it was to be real. I backed away but it definitely made me more hesitant to be honest with ppl about pain and ability", "NTA. What kind of munchausen by TikTok crap is that?", "NTA...  you could always be petty, make something up and see what happens", "There may be some elements of mental illness here. Try and ask her about it without being too judgemental . Munchausens is a real condition where people try to get sympathy to try and make themselves feel better.", "Yea I wanna see a continuation where OP just says random shit to have Janet mimic it but it gets more ridiculous over time.", "Yup - this made me think of that episode of the Office where they make up diseases when Dwight is choosing the health care plan.   OP could get real creative with this, and then enjoy watching the followers be like...wait a minute.\n\nBut really the best thing is to step away from that relationship.", "Also see the edit: the friend \"feels\" like she has an autoimmune disease but isn't getting tested to know which one. As someone with an autoimmune disease (a real one), I am abso-fuckin-lutely furious at that \"friend\". Not only is she a liar, she is also incredibly stupid. It's very obvious she has nothing and is pretending for attention.", "I'd tell you have some terminal, incurable disease... But don't tell her it's incurable!!! Something that would typically kill within a month or two. Just hope she doesn't actually look it up. When she's still alive in a couple of months, presto, you've shown she's a liar.", "Check out the edit - she isn\u2019t even diagnosed, she \u201cfeels\u201d like she has it.", "Yeah, this.\n\nIt's not easy for a lot of people to get properly diagnosed, and if her issue were the cost of the bloodwork / finding a specialist who doesn't suck / etc. I'd get it. But it's a process I'd at least expect someone to have started working on.", "Another one like that has the OP use a cousin ridiculous wig to trick someone they know at college who won't stop copying them to badly dye their hair\n\nI believe friends of the copier were trying to get the OP to pay for hair appointments to fix it", "That story was glorious!", "\"my hands hurts so much, but not when I put them in the armpits of old people\"", "This isn\u2019t true. You have many cutaneous nerves in your arm branching off at various points, and based on the nature of the injury you absolutely can have isolated hand numbness. You may be thinking of a spinal cord injury- roots C5-T1 supply the arm and if one is injured where it leaves the spinal cord there is a very predictable pattern of numbness in what is called a \u201cdermatome\u201d distribution. But this only occurs if the entire root is injured where it leaves the spinal cord, not another branching nerve farther down the arm.", "This is true but you can still use your elbow while your hands become useless because it works its way \"up\" your arm in severity. I get hand numbness from panic attacks.", "Can someone confirm this?", "That's not true at all. I had a hand that was constantly going numb. Just my hand nowhere else. I has a cyst on that wrist that was rather large so I thought that was the cause and found an orthopedic dr to look at it. Come to find out that my hand numbness was because I had an ulnar (elbow area) nerve entrapment. The rest of my arm didn't go numb, just my hand and not even my whole hand. It was not psychosomatic I had actual quantifiable nerve damage. Took about 2-3 years to recover my grip strength after the surgery. 6 months of PT to get  the joint stabilized. They did my elbow and took out the cyst on my wrist at the same time.", "[removed]", "That edit is enraging. I have Multiple Sclerosis, and I'm in pain every single day. I've run into too many people who don't understand what an invisible disability is, or they think they know some random little thing I can change to help myself become fully healed. People like that \"friend\" don't give a shit if they unintentionally spread incorrect info, just so long as they get attention and have their followers.", ">As someone with an autoimmune disease (a real one), I am abso-fuckin-lutely furious at that \"friend\".\n\nAs someone with ME/CFS, hard same! She's the type of person that gets us labelled as fakers, and chronic illnesses as a group taken less seriously by doctors.", "It would not surprise me if there was a go fund me either already in existence or about to be launched. Call me cynical but\u2026", "Good to know, thanks! I\u2019ve edited my comment. I\u2019m glad that you knew enough to correct me.", "It\u2019s apparently incorrect.
