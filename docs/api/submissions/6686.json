This is how your post reads to me:\n\n\"When I approached him he said \"I'm working\" and he'll see me when he gets home.\"\n\n* You moseyed up unannounced at your young son's very public (and maybe first?) job and he diplomatically & discreetly set a boundary that should have been easy to understand.\n\n\"I said I'm not his dad, just a customer.\"\n\n* You pushed back against his boundary and tried to debate. Again, at his very public job.\n\n\"He asked his coworker to help me...\"\n\n* He tried again to avoid interacting with you. Again... while he was working.\n\n\"As I left, I quickly said \"love you.\"\"\n\n* This is where you became at least a soft TA.  He'd already shown you that he was uncomfortable interacting with \"Daddo\" while he was trying to work and this seems like you wanting to leave the situation knowing you got your way.\n\nEverything after that part of your post...\n\n* Your son tried to re-express boundaries after the fact, and you doubled down and made it about you.  Making rationalizations & projections about other kids & their parents.  Put your ego aside and listen to your son. **YTA.**", "YTA. Your heart may have been in the right place but your child is trying to make their way in the workforce and start commandeering some respect amongst his peers, which is going to be a struggle if you insist on doing things that make him uncomfortable. Respect that he\u2019s on the clock and trying to do his job.", "YTA, when you enter a store you\u2019re a customer so act like one. You embarrassed him in front of his co workers and if the co workers don\u2019t even know you\u2019re his dad than an I love you can come out wrong.", "Idk. I can see your kid being embarrassed but I wouldn\u2019t have minded. When I was 16-20 or so working my part time jobs while in school my family would stop by once in a blue moon \u201cas customers\u201d and I\u2019d insist I take their order and then tell my coworkers \u201cthat\u2019s my family\u201d and theyd say \u201cAYYY Mr. Last Name \u201c or whatever, joke around. I\u2019d take 1-2 min off till to ask my family what they were up to if it was slow. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal. I actually felt pretty proud to be seen by my parents as a grown-up doing my thing. I guess NAH. Respect your sons wishes next time but I don\u2019t think ur an AH for showing up to see your son work his job from your post it sounds more like \u201cI\u2019m proud to see my boy working and growing up\u201d type of thing not \u201ccontrolling AH who wants to embarrass my son\u201d", "YTA", "Come on man. You were once a teenager. You know how annoying it is when parents do that. And even if you have zero self awareness and somehow don\u2019t know that, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen enough movies or YouTube videos to know how kids, especially teenagers, react to parents telling them they love them in public.  \nYou may think you\u2019re being cute or funny, but you make your kid uncomfortable in an environment that is new to him.  \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nDid you think that in the 8-12 hours he'd be working, he was going to forget that you love him, so decided to remind him in the middle of his shift that you love him?\n\n\n>His coworkers probably think how nice it is that this new kid has a dad who cares about him\n\nDo you actually love him or do you just want others to think that  you do?", "YTA.  When I worked at a fast food place down the street from my mom's house, I was very open to her stopping by, getting some food, having a quick chat, giving her a hug, all of that kind of stuff.  It didn't bother me at all, I actually quite enjoyed having those moments.  My job has changed considerably since then and sometimes I want to go back to being a teen and having my mom stop by work just to say hi. \n\nBut your son doesn't want that and he's allowed to make those boundaries and you need to respect them.  It sounds like you're a great dad and you really love your kid.  If you really feel the desire to see him and also remind him that you love him, go get your orange juice, then send him a text as you walk out of Starbucks and into Target.", "Agreed. I'm the opposite. I was so excited to serve my parents at my first job to show I'm responsible but I can totally see the flip. You're teaching him work values, so remember your context.", "Speak for yourself. I'll tell people I love them when I get really exceptional service.", "You would be surprised. Sometimes it\u2019s a fast \u201ck bye I love you\u201d which sometimes they pick up on and apologize and sometimes they don\u2019t, and other times it\u2019s CreeperMgee coming into confess.\n\nSource: worked as a barista for a few years during uni", "That's no where near the same mate and even you know that", "Yes! He literally just said I love you and he overreacted and hurt his feelings. Some people just think too much of others and their validation, like his son.", "I agree completely. It\u2019s one thing for the kid to want to take his job seriously. It\u2019s another to act so rudely about it.", "From OPs description, he wasn\u2019t making a scene, he wasn\u2019t disruptive, nor was he interfering with work since he had a coworker help him instead. Banning someone for the store for coming in, paying for a drink and saying \u201clove you\u201d as they walked out? I hope you never manage a store because this is the most amount of over reaction I\u2019ve ever heard. He wasn\u2019t controlling anything, he didn\u2019t throw a fit when someone other than his son helped him. He wasn\u2019t being needy, and he wasn\u2019t out of place. If he didn\u2019t say \u201clove you\u201d as he was leaving I\u2019d doubt you\u2019d even recognize there was a family relationship if you observed. His kid is 18 and probably is being a typical teen that is afraid of being embarrassed in front of co workers because teens aren\u2019t like \u201comg hey look it\u2019s my parents!!!\u201d Most of the time.", "You would ban a customer from the store for saying \u201clove you\u201d to their son on their way out after patronizing your store? Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a tad extreme?", "I\u2019m surprised I had to scroll so far to find a \u201cNAH\u201d. The kid\u2019s being a typical teenager, the dad\u2019s being a typical dad who\u2019s proud of his son. Sometimes there\u2019s a bit of miscommunication \u2014 OP just shouldn\u2019t do it again now that he understands his son\u2019s boundaries while at work.", "Not even just when he's had his own kids haha. Apparently a person's brain isn't fully developed until they're 25+. Maturity can come with age and with life experience. Teenagers can be especially sensitive when trying to establish their own boundaries and trying to separate themselves from the family/their parents and become independent. I think OP's child is still in that phase where they want to be fiercely independent and are a little awkward about their parents being around them. That being said, I still think OP isn't really the AH for telling his kid that he loves them, even if it's at his place of work. I think OP did fine, but if his kid is really that upset about it, he should respect his kid's boundaries about it until the child is mature enough to have that kind of understanding about workplace relationships.\n\nOverall though, I'd say OP is NTA", "My daughter used to ask me to come by her job all the time so her coworkers could see how similar we looked. I asked her if she would be embarrassed if I came in and she said no. \n\nWhen I worked retail parents would stop by regularly and we got to know them well.  I still speak to former coworkers parents if I see them in public. \n\nHe\u2019s just nervous because it\u2019s his first job and he\u2019s a young man.

My wife couldn't even serve our kid's step uncle.  That is our daughter's step mother's brother who we don't know. Just the fact that he was \"related\" to our daughter made him off limits.", "In every retail place I've worked or my friends worked, you were not allowed to ring up family and you were supposed to not ring up friends. Minor exceptions were made for cousins and such depending on the company but if it was a parent, spouse, siblings, etc, you could not ring them up.", "My parents used to shop where I worked when I was a kid. They knew I couldn\u2019t handle their transaction due to the rules and they were cool with it. I would however come over and say hi and see what they were getting\u2026see if they got anything for me \ud83d\ude02", "In most retail customer service roles it's generally deemed as \"suss\", if not outright forbidden, for someone to serve/cash out family members, domestic partners, or even close friends. It's just too easy for you to give them the \"wrong\" change, or \"forget\" to scan an item, \"accidentally\" ring something up incorrectly (for less than it actually costs, obviously), or otherwise allow/offer them discounts that shouldn't actually be valid. \n\nFor food service stuff there's the additional concern that you might add extra things to a drink that would normally cost money and not charge for it because it's for a family member/partner/friend. There's the risk of that fraud/favoritism in addition to the risk that another customer notices and demands the same treatment.", "It could be a policy, a lot of retail jobs I had prohibited employees waiting on or checking out family and friends. To keep employees from giving away free stuff and stealing.", "It's not an official rule at my job, more an unspoken one, but when one of us has someone come in that we're close to (i.e. friends, family, spouses), we pass off to a coworker if we have one on shift.", "It's probably in his contract that he's not allowed to ring up family. It was in mine for multiple store jobs.", "When I was in high school, me and my friend were working the ticket office of a movie theater. Most people dont do small talk, like  \"hi!\", just the name of the movie if they were alone. So this one guy walked up and just said \"i Love you man\" (obviously meaning the movie) and my friens just looked at him weird and said \"thank...youu....\" the guy looked up, realized his mistake and we all had a good laugh, especially the guys friend. \n\n\nThis has nothing to do with anything, but your story reminded me of it, and hope it makes you feel better about telling the batista that you loved them.", "But that's why I disagree with you, is that the son \\*did\\* specifically ask for OP not to talk to him at work. That seems like a pretty reasonable boundary to me, and OP broke that boundary. Sure, if the kid is at the job in 6 months and still holds that boundary, there's definitely something else going on and a conversation to be had, but it's understandable early on in the job.", "It makes him a TA now because even in his post he is dismissing his son\u2019s right to not be intruded on at work by his parents.  It\u2019s the comment that he\u2019s a nice guy and a better dad, using that as some kind of trump card on what his son is saying right now.", "It\u2019s his place of WORK! Who cares if you weren\u2019t a customer anymore?! Leave him alone and let him get on with his job. YTA", "He came in once. By the sound of it I doubt he\u2019ll be going back anytime soon. His son had someone else serve him, only reason the kid is probably awkward is because he\u2019s an 18yo boy and parents are embarrassing to teenagers.", "It\u2019s the bait and switch that he\u2019s pulling. He\u2019s \u201cjust a customer\u201d when it benefits him, then suddenly he\u2019s Dad when he wants to be Dad. Or did you think customers get to tell employees they love them?\n\nOP feels manipulative and intrusive to me, not honest and caring.", "Here's what I think.\n\nThe kid is 18 and it's his first real job. This means he's exploring his way to adulthood. It's his first place where he can be an adult without being known as 'the child of X'. Dad coming into the store and treating him not as a regular barista, made him seem like he's coddling him.\n\nKid doesn't want to. He just wants the space to explore the concept of growing up.\n\nWhile OP has good intentions and might think it's 'cute', I don't think it's very appropriate because it may seem (to the kid) that he's not being validated and is being babyfied. If the dad wants to be supportive, he could've waited until the kid finished his first shift and asked him how his day went.", "I think you have to seriously lack self awareness if you don\u2019t understand that an 18 year old May be embarrassed by their parent, especially parent like OP who clearly isn\u2019t thinking about how his son feels.  The OP is only thinking about his thinks his son should feel.", "Because you embarrass them?", "What?? That\u2019s *madness*. Capitalism has really messed with human beings in every way possible.", "Never was told that. I served people I knew and never got in trouble. My manager also did that too. Most of my friends at other stores were allowed to check me out too.

Setting a boundary on that makes you an asshole? Just because someone sets a boundary doesnt mean its justified.

I'm so lost on this logic right now.", "So he can't go there ever now because the son works there?", "The sons reaction makes me think this is a pattern for dad tbh. My parents always gave me space with friends / at school / at work - would follow my lead, never over stepped or made things awkward. Were worried about embarrassing me (although in reality I never felt embarrassed by them and was very happy for them to be around and chat to me and my friends!). \n\nMy friends who had overbearing parents kept them much, much more at arms length and would get annoyed very quickly as we got older. Not because of the isolated incident necessarily but because it\u2019s a pattern. \u201cGreat ok of course dad has come in on purpose to see me at work despite the fact he doesn\u2019t drink coffee.

OP can visit the store when his son isn't working. \n\nOP only wants to visit to check in on his son, he doesn't even drink coffee. That's annoying and for many kids, also embarrassing. His kid can't even serve him because almost all Starbucks (and retail places) have a policy against employees serving their family members, and now they all know that this kid is OP's son. OP literally has zero reason to be at this place while his kid is working.", "Right?\n\nIf I knew a company had a policy like this, I don\u2019t think I could patronise them in good conscience.

She was given insane rules including being asked to film herself at the end of shifts lifting up her shirt to show her stomach so \u201ccorporate\u201d could check if she was stealing; had a minimum target for disciplinary action against staff; had to do \u201chomework\u201d - not training / courses but these dumb sheets.

I encourage you to read their comment again, they say that OP shouldn't have come in when their kid was working. \n\nPlease check out all the people in the top comment thread who can attest to this being in place, especially those who have worked at Starbucks. Obviously it varies from place to place but it a very common policy.\n\nIt does have other drinks, but OP isn't just happening to head into Starbucks because he wants an orange juice. He was already doing grocery shopping, could have got the orange juice then (for much cheaper). He wanted to go see his son, not for the juice."]}
