I can imagine an 18 yo being embarrassed by their parent saying I love you. But that doesn\u2019t make the parent TA. The kid just needs to learn love.

Communication is key for them both now.", "Also, the learning curve at Starbucks is quite steep -  it gets pretty predictable once you've got the rhythm down (about 3-6 weeks depending on the person and the store), but I wouldn't have wanted anyone to visit me in those first few weeks when I worked for the Siren because I felt a bit overwhelmed a lot of the time.", "Well that\u2019s incredibly dramatic.", "We really need a gif of Billy Visco saying \u201cdo better\u201d here but I can\u2019t actually find one.", "Yes!", "To call this boundary stomping is insulting - this does not seem pre thought out, malicious or with an intent to even cross their boundaries.

The only thing he said was \u201cI\u2019m working\u201d I would tell my spouse I love them while working, why wouldn\u2019t I tell my child?

It would be bad parenting to show up daily after your child says \u201cdo not come to my work\u201d and do the same. He has a right to a first offense", "Yeah and I totally get that. I've had my dad come in a few times and I didn't care.

My family always tries to name drop me when they visit my place of business, followed by requests for discounts and other bs. We\u2019ve been taught to separate home and work. Props to the son for attempting to set that standard. YTA to the Dad for stomping on them.", "Yeah I\u2019m laughing at this because it seems like a trope almost. The proud, sweethearted dad who wants to support his son and does something a little goofy, and the overly embarrassed teenager who gets furious and overreacts.\n\nBut OP is still TA. Saying \u201cI\u2019m working\u201d and clearly being nervous at a new job would convey certain cues about certain boundaries to the majority of people that OP missed or actively ignored. I don\u2019t know which based on the dismissiveness in OP\u2019s comments. \n\nIf OP missed those cues, he could\u2019ve remedied it by apologizing and saying it wouldn\u2019t happen again, then letting his teenager cool off. Maybe avoid the teenager\u2019s job for a bit. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t realize that his child\u2019s boundaries and level of comfort are *more important* than his need to express his pride. OP didn\u2019t do anything to remedy making his child uncomfortable or respect that his child had set a boundary. That\u2019s why I think OP is TA in this instance.", "It really is tough. I know when I drop my teenager off at school and pick him up, I'm always trying to not bring too much attention to myself because he's an introvert. On the flip side, I do silly stuff around my other kid, because he likes it and thinks it's funny for people to see that his mom is a weirdo. \n\nI think it kind of rubbed me the wrong way that OP seemed more concerned about his son's coworkers thinking it's cool that he's got a supportive dad, and his own hurt feelings, than he seemed to be about how his son was feeling. I read this post to my son, and we both agreed that since his kid said \"I'm working, I'll see you when I get home\" that was the boundary being set, and him staying and saying \"I'm just a customer\" and buying orange juice because he doesn't even drink coffee instead of just saying \"okay, see you later, love ya\" and leaving, the boundary was not respected. I can see your perspective too, just thought I'd go a little more into where mine came from. Either way, parenting is tough!", "But oddly acurrate. I can't see anything in it that's not completely factual.", "Yay! \ud83d\ude02", "This while post is OP pouting because his feelings are hurt because his son doesn\u2019t want him embarrassing him at work. ie OP dismisses and refuses to accept this son\u2019s boundaries. That\u2019s what makes him a bad parent. Fine if he didn\u2019t know the nondairy in the first place, but it doesn\u2019t take much to see why a kid doesn\u2019t want the parent embarrassing them at work, that\u2019s a pretty low bar. But his behaviour after that, is all bad parenting. You\u2019ve read that he believes that after the money changed hands he wasn\u2019t a customer so he was allowed to be Daddy right? Have you read any of his actual comments?", "Totally agree. First time dad say that and you\u2019re bothered \u201chey dad, don\u2019t do that again\u201d if he repeats, then dad is an AH.", "You know, I agree with you. I can\u2019t say OP is TA, I\u2019m going to say NAH. A clear miscommunication. When you see pride in someone they may be blurred (OP) and same with feeling embarrassment (son) both were probably feeling high anxiety and acted on the anxiety rather than stepping back and thinking clearly.", "Oh definitely. I\u2019m not, *by any means*, saying the teenager didn\u2019t react pretty dramatically lol. That\u2019s expected. He\u2019s a teenager. Teenagers are dramatic. \n\nI\u2019m not saying OP is *wrong* for expressing his love or pride, either. Actually, he\u2019s mostly representing a pretty decent father. He\u2019s supportive, clearly proud, clearly loves his son and family, didn\u2019t react with anger when his feelings were hurt, he actively expressed and identified his feelings to his teenager. That\u2019s all really good parenting, in my opinion.\n\nBased on OP\u2019s comments, though, I\u2019m thinking he flat out doesn\u2019t care that he made his kid uncomfortable and he probably thinks his kid should just deal with it *because* most rational people don\u2019t care that he told his kid \u201clove you\u201d. I think that\u2019s definitely the wrong approach.", "I actually haven\u2019t read any of OPs comments. So with that being said, I\u2019m going to say we are on the same page completely.
