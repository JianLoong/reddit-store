Your mom is definitely the AH here.\n\nYour parents' issues are between them; if you can, tell them that whenever it comes up. You do not have to listen to your mom 'rant' about you dad. That is not about you--even if she thought it was (and this seems to have been about your dad and your little sister).\n\nEven IF your father decided to get closer 'to upset her'--that would NOT be your fault, your problem, or anything you have to hear about. Your mom can take it up with your dad. The parents need to keep it between them.", "Oh honey no, NTA. Your mom is though and she needs to stop talking bad about your dad in front of you, and you are old enough to tell her to stop, and how it makes you feel.\n\nThis is called \"parental alienation\" and is a version of abuse. No matter how mad your mother is at your dad, no matter her reasons it is NOT OKAY for her to make you feel bad for ANY relationship with your father.\n\nYOU are allowed to love your dad AND her, and she needs to stop, and be told to stop this nonsense. It's not good for you, not good for her, or your father, and is just wrong. You keep being you and loving your Dad, and being affectionate, no matter what your mother says, but please, for your sake, ask her to stop doing that. Any beef she has with your dad should be directed at him, not you, ever.", "NTA and pretty fucked to involve you in any way in their personal dispute.", "Your relationship with your dad is entirely separate from her relationship with her ex.

Your mom is allowed to be frustrated with your dad. But that's her business and nothing to do with you. It's unacceptable that she's venting about him *to you*. He's your dad.
