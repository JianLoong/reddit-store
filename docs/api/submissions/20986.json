There was one bit of bread left and I was hungry so I checked the drawer in the fridge where this community lunch supplies are usually kept.  There was a bag of salami and provolone cheese so I took a slice of cheese.  \n\nWhen I went to chat with the receptionist, she got mad when she saw the cheese on my bread.  She said it was her cheese that she brought for her lunch, and I apologized & offered to buy her more. She just said I was an AH for eating someone's lunch.  I tried to apologize and tell her I thought it was community cheese because it was in the drawer where the community lunch stuff is always held. If it was on the shelf, where individual lunches are, I never would have touched it.\n\nShes telling people I ate her lunch now, but I think its ridiculous because it was a single slice of cheese and (I think) an honest mistake given the culture of work providing stuff like meat and cheese to us.  It's a small office and it's honestly kind of becoming a bit of \"drama\" but it feels so silly.  \n\nI might just not be seeing the perspective, because I DID eat her cheese.

Firstly, \"community cheese\" is a hilarious phrase. Secondly, if the cheese was in the community drawer, she has no room for complaint. \n\nShe needs to properly store her lunch.\n\n\nLol community cheese", "NTA\n\nIn a communal fridge I think its usual for it to be assumed its for everyone unless clearly labelled. You offered to replace the cheese which is all you could do. \n\nAlso a slice of cheese is not a lunch. It was an honest mistake and you attempted to resolve it.", "NTA. \n\nShe shouldn't put it in the same drawer where community food is kept. \n\nShe at the very least could've labelled it so avoid confusion. How else were you supposed to know?", "NTA. I could brie misreading this, but you didn't do jack wrong. Eating the cheese was a mistake, and you apologized. \"Repaying\" her would be a gouda thing to do, but she clearly overreacted. She cheddar be more careful where she puts her personal food next time.", "Thanks for the folks who have commented already.  I felt like I was taking crazy pills over a slice of dang cheese.  Wasn't sure if I was just being an AH cause AH's usually think they haven't done anything wrong.", "NTA. I'm sure somewhere in your office there was a marker she could have used to write her name on it. That's on her!", "NTA, she put her cheese in the wrong area. Maybe she should pay attention more next time. For f*ck sake it was a piece of cheese", "Well, I saw the title and came in prepared to say you're TA, but this seems like a pretty innocent mistake and you did everything you could at the time to rectify it, so NTA.", "NTA she shouldn't put it in the community drawer or she should label it with her name.\n\nYou literally had zero idea this was personal food and even offered to replace it", "NTA unless it was labeled with her name on it, like it should have been in a community fridge.", "NTA- and I would report it to HR the whole situation because if she's already telling people you stole your lunch that is going to create a hostile workplace for you.  \n\nEven if it's just unofficially, people won't trust you if you steal.", "NTA. You handled the situation well, unlike your coworker. Bake them some muffin or something as apology and just forget it.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't realize you were eating someone's cheese. You apologized and offered to replace it.\n\nShe then went around like you deliberately stole her cheese and flaunted it her face like some sort of Muenster.\n\nI'd buy her a pack of cheese and most keep it strictly professional going forward.", "NTA. If it was hers, why would she do that? It was unmarked and in the company-supplied food area. You had no way of knowing. Apologizing and offering to buy her a slice was actually more than you needed to do to make up for her mistake.\r  \n\r  \nDon't overlook the possibility of deception. This could well have been a company-supplied item that she decided she wanted.", "NTA but go buy her something nice for her lunch and it will all smooth over", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
