There was a bag of salami and provolone cheese so I took a slice of cheese.  \n\nWhen I went to chat with the receptionist, she got mad when she saw the cheese on my bread.  She said it was her cheese that she brought for her lunch, and I apologized & offered to buy her more. She just said I was an AH for eating someone's lunch.  I tried to apologize and tell her I thought it was community cheese because it was in the drawer where the community lunch stuff is always held. If it was on the shelf, where individual lunches are, I never would have touched it.\n\nShes telling people I ate her lunch now, but I think its ridiculous because it was a single slice of cheese and (I think) an honest mistake given the culture of work providing stuff like meat and cheese to us.  It's a small office and it's honestly kind of becoming a bit of \"drama\" but it feels so silly.  \n\nI might just not be seeing the perspective, because I DID eat her cheese.

Firstly, \"community cheese\" is a hilarious phrase.

It was an honest mistake and you attempted to resolve it.", "NTA. \n\nShe shouldn't put it in the same drawer where community food is kept. \n\nShe at the very least could've labelled it so avoid confusion. How else were you supposed to know?", "NTA. I could brie misreading this, but you didn't do jack wrong. Eating the cheese was a mistake, and you apologized. \"Repaying\" her would be a gouda thing to do, but she clearly overreacted. She cheddar be more careful where she puts her personal food next time.", "Thanks for the folks who have commented already.  I felt like I was taking crazy pills over a slice of dang cheese.  Wasn't sure if I was just being an AH cause AH's usually think they haven't done anything wrong.", "NTA. I'm sure somewhere in your office there was a marker she could have used to write her name on it. That's on her!", "NTA, she put her cheese in the wrong area.

You handled the situation well, unlike your coworker. Bake them some muffin or something as apology and just forget it.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't realize you were eating someone's cheese. You apologized and offered to replace it.\n\nShe then went around like you deliberately stole her cheese and flaunted it her face like some sort of Muenster.\n\nI'd buy her a pack of cheese and most keep it strictly professional going forward.", "NTA. If it was hers, why would she do that? It was unmarked and in the company-supplied food area. You had no way of knowing. Apologizing and offering to buy her a slice was actually more than you needed to do to make up for her mistake.\r  \n\r  \nDon't overlook the possibility of deception.
