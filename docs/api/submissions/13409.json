That doesn't make you an asshole, maybe just a bit clueless.\n\nAnd she's not an asshole for telling you that if you're going to drop a few hundred bucks on her, make sure she can make it work first. Otherwise you're putting unnecessary pressure on her.", "I'm going with NAH. \n\nI have a lot of flexibility with my job. If my wife planned something like this for me, I'd be game. Even if it wasn't something I'm super into, taking a day off just isn't that big of a deal for me. It's a lovely perk of my job, and one I'm grateful for. \n\nBut my wife's job is the exact opposite. Days off are precious. She doesn't get many, and so she wants to use her days off for things she really enjoys. So, while maybe my wife would enjoy a concert *in a vacuum*, the opportunity cost of the concert is high- that's a day she has to take off and doesn't get to use for something else. \n\nSo, for you, you're trying to do something nice for your SO. That is good. But for her, it can seem like you're dictating the use of her PTO, which might be in short supply. Neither of you are trying to do anything bad here, and both of you have a very reasonable take. \n\nSo, moving forward- this is a good learning experience. Your SO really values her days off, and choosing what to use them for. No more surprises like this which require her to use her days off. At the same time, her reaction could have been better. Something like \"I know you're tying to give me a nice surprise, but it in the future, know I want to discuss with you when my PTO is used.\"", "NAH\n\nYou meant well but you had no idea if she was available: Would she be working, did she have a meeting lined up with friends, etc. And it turns out she was working as she says she has to take the day off for it.\n\nPersonally I feel smaller things make for better surprises. Planning a concert is a bit more serious, especially if it's a distant one.", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong for wanting to get her something nice. \n\nShe\u2019s not wrong for thinking it\u2019d be best to communicate beforehand on something that\u2019s going to a) cost hundreds of dollars and b) possibly requiring coordination on her end for time off to be able to partake (and assuming that it\u2019s something she\u2019d want to use leave for). \n\nSimple communication issue, and an easy enough one to learn from.", "NAH, it was a nice gesture but truthfully, surprises rarely work out like we wish, because of feelings from everybody involved. You wanted to do something nice, which is great, but you made assumptions about her work, which isn't great so in the end everybody's feelings are hurt.", "Info: what does she do for work?", "You meant well, but just because you thought it would be sweet doesn't mean she has to feel the same way. She's kind of right that now she \"has\" to take a day off instead of choosing if she wants to.\n\nNext time just give her a heads up, \"would you like to go to concert on x day/time?\" and let her check her schedule.", "NAH as long as you don\u2019t get upset at her for not being able to go and that before you do something like this again, you ask if she\u2019s free and wants to go. \n\nCan totally see where she\u2019s coming from as I don\u2019t like using my time off for concerts at all. Even if it\u2019s a band I love.", "NAH. You meant to do something nice, but yes getting time off with only week's notice can be really tough and now she's in a position to feel guilty about the tickets if she can't go.

Good luck!", "YTA for saying you bought them for her. You bought them for yourself and expected her to take a day off of work to go with you after you had spent hundreds of dollars without consulting her.", "YTA for this part:\n\n> I really think that it was a dramatic reaction and a nice surprise.\n\nYou don't get to decide if she's being dramatic or not.

A gift is supposed to be enjoyable for the other person. You've now put the burden on her of taking a day off and using valuable PTO to see one of your favorite bands. Her saying \"it's a nice thought, but insensitive to assume she'd be available\" is 100% accurate and also doesn't sound like she was *\"pissed*.\" It sounds like you expected her to happily shift her life around based on a surprise gift and are annoyed that that's not how real life works.", "YTA\n\nIt's not dramatic, you meant well but didn't think what day will be the concert? And it's so far you'd be away for all day. If you wanted it to be a surprise, you could just asked if she was available that day. She's not responsible for you spending hundred of dollars without been even sure if she could attend, you're an adult, you're responsible for your own decisions. Communitacion is key in all relationships.", "I'm sorry but YTA. You can't schedule a wildly inconvenient event for someone, to experience something they feel largely indifferent toward, without talking to them first. And if you do, you can't expect a completely enthusiastic response. \n\nYou're not an irredeemable asshole or anything, but in this situation I think you're the person in the wrong.", "YTA  - ask first", "NTA but her reaction to a very thoughtful gift is concerning. The concert is in October and she can\u2019t miss one day of work 6 months from now?", "NAH - It was nice on your part but you have to accept the fact that she might not be able to or does not want to go due to work. It sounds like she overreacted, being \"*pissed*\" (unless it was because you kept insisting). If she doesn't want to go, then accept it and sell the ticket online or to a friend. If that doesn't work out, then that's the expense of assuming someone can go to a concert and buying them a ticket without asking.", "Yta - surprises aren't supposed to be: 1) what the gift giver wants. Waiting a whole day to like one band? Ugh. And 2] inconvenient. She's now taking a day off to do something she doesn't want to instead of saving it for when she wants to use it.", "YHA - although not exactly an asshole, just rather silly. As you said, live music is YOUR thing. And it was YOUR fav music groups playing. Doesn\u2019t sound like you were thinking about her likes. She said it was a nice thought so she isn\u2019t the AH either. But next time time think about her needs and wants. Is this concert really so great for her that it\u2019s worth her spending one of her days off travelling there? Time off for most people is limited. Be more aware to her needs and not so focussed on your own", "Its 6 months from now. Why would she blow up like this? Makes absolutely no sense.

You could sell the other ticket, go with a friend - as someone who loves concerts as much as you, I'm assuming you have people in your life that also love them, and I'm assuming that you have many easy Plan B's here.

I can understand that for her, going to this concert involves a lot, taking the day off and traveling a good distance. And for that reason, this may not be a great gift for her. But to be pissed about it seems like a bit too much. \n\nThen again, she doesn't seemed pissed based on the description. She made sure to say it was a nice thought, and seemed more to express frustration that OP didn't think it through. And its possible that stuff like that has happened between the two of them before, and she's frustrated that OP is not listening to her, and not understanding what is involved in her life. \n\nSo I guess my vote is not enough info, as it depends on their dynamic and relationship history.", "NTA. We're talking about a date six months from now. I understand how difficult it is to get time off as a teacher, especially for something like a concert and it's perfectly valid to not want to do it. But there's no reason to get upset about something happening in six months.

It's a nice gesture, and on the plus side at least she has a lot of advance notice to see if she could take that day off (I know that can be a pain for teachers so I also understand if she feels it'd be more trouble than it's worth). But I feel like that's a pretty huge leap to buy tickets to something on a day where the recipient has to work or otherwise has obligations like school or taking care of someone.\n\nI know it may spoil OP's surprise a bit in their mind, but honestly the best thing to do would've been to ask her if she'd want to go, even just pose it as a hypothetical, though it'd be best to just say \"Hey remember that concert with (band)? They're coming to (city) on (date), it's a (day of the week) though. Do you think you'd be able to take time off of work to go?\" or something along those lines before buying tickets.", "Also as something she would enjoy. \nYou love the band, if there was an easy to get to concert at a convenient time then that\u2019s a really nice surprise. But let\u2019s be clear here, this is a band you love. your Gf showed mild interest in because you love it. It was a gift for you that you wanted her to enjoy too.

I teach kindergarten, so if I take a day, I have to write out in detail exactly what I do for six hours - plus details about which kids go to speech at what time, who has IEP accommodations, who runs off from class, bathroom procedures, daily routines, and of course the actual lesson plans which I make from scratch because I can\u2019t expect a sub to do all the same stuff I would do. I have to prep all the materials and put away things I don\u2019t want used if I\u2019m not there.

Long story.", "OP said she was pissed off, but then says she said it was a nice thought but insensitive to her situation.

How much of the date did you really thing would be fun \"for us\" vs how much you yourself would enjoy it?  And really, why didn't you ask her straight out if she wanted to go before you bought the tickets?\n\nNow, I may be bringing my own experience into this, but here's what can happen here.  One half of a couple is really, really into something and the other isn't, and normally the other is pretty easygoing and so it's ok.  But this time it's kind of a big deal, because it's very expensive, on a worknight, and that means asking for a day off that might be inconvenient, not well-appreciated, or not even possible.  Not to mention unpaid.  The music fan knows this, and so doesn't ask before buying the tickets because if they give their partner any input they might actually say no.  But if it's already a done deal, that person can't say no without looking like an ungrateful jerk and fun-killer.   I was pissed--I mean, I *would* be pissed--about this too.

People can request off, people can use PTO, it\u2019s common to do for an activity you\u2019re interested in. If she can\u2019t get time off why does that make you the asshole for keeping her in your thoughts?", "NTA. The right reaction from her would be \"I'm sorry, I can't go\". Maybe you can go with a friend. Or maybe you could move the spare, or, if you don't want to go without her, both tickets on to someone else. Some ticket sellers have a resale platform (to limit the impact of scalping). You made a nice gesture as a surprise. Sometimes a surprise isn't going to go off the way you plan, and it's not like anyone got hurt.", "NAH but really? It's in October and only one day, people here are trying to say that teachers cannot plan a day off? Thats completely fucked up if true.....", "NAH, but you might work on your communication. It looks like she knew one of the bands in the lineup, but it doesn\u2019t sound like she was psyched about going. It also seems hard for her to get out of work and the balance of seeing one act you like vs just missing it and having time off later may not be in favor of the show. \n\nI like going to shows a lot as well and my wife does too, but she\u2019s not always up for it.

It was a nice gesture, even if it should have been planned out and communicated better.  But she could have just said thanks for thinking of me, but logistically it probably won't work out - maybe you should take a friend or sell them instead. Or just wait on it and see how she feels closer to the show date. Hardly something to get worked up over, unless there is a pattern of you making decisions without considering how they impact her first.\n\nSidenote: There's a lot of moving parts to consider when planning a surprise for someone. Try to think things through a bit better next time.", "It would be n a h for most jobs but she\u2019s a teacher, so YTA.

Instead of stewing over it, take a friend who shares your taste music.", "NTA-based on the YTA comments you cant buy a teacher a gift that involves having to arrange time off work.

She got months of warning. She didn't need to be so rude about rejecting it.", "YTA because I don\u2019t believe you bought the tickets for her, you bought them for yourself and hoped it looked like you did something thoughtful (when you didn\u2019t actually consider the date of the concert and how that would affect her). Not much of a gift.", "NTA. If she's a public school teacher she should have a set number of paid sick days. If the venue doors open at 6 that means the main act won't go on till 8, so based on the timeline you gave with her getting home around 4:30 that's ample time for travel and such. Even if she did have to take a day off, you're giving her 6 months notice to put together a sub plan for a single day of art classes. I think that's  pretty ample time to make plans for anything at all.\n\nI guess I can see it being kind of selfish to get tickets for a band you like more than she does, but to get pissed off at you about it is bizarre. It still seems like a nice gesture to try to plan a nice night out to me unless you spent her money on it.", "NTA \nyou did something kind and put in effort!

Hell, I've bought concert tickets to things that my friends don't even care about, and they've still wanted to go just because I was excited!\n\nI just don't understand her reaction at all, and cannot imagine anyone I know saying that a present was \"insensitive\" because it would require taking a day off of work (with a huge amount of notice) to go do something fun with their partner.", "Me personally- I would be grateful but apologetic that I have to work.
