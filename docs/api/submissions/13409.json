That doesn't make you an asshole, maybe just a bit clueless.\n\nAnd she's not an asshole for telling you that if you're going to drop a few hundred bucks on her, make sure she can make it work first. Otherwise you're putting unnecessary pressure on her.", "I'm going with NAH. \n\nI have a lot of flexibility with my job. If my wife planned something like this for me, I'd be game. Even if it wasn't something I'm super into, taking a day off just isn't that big of a deal for me. It's a lovely perk of my job, and one I'm grateful for. \n\nBut my wife's job is the exact opposite. Days off are precious. She doesn't get many, and so she wants to use her days off for things she really enjoys. So, while maybe my wife would enjoy a concert *in a vacuum*, the opportunity cost of the concert is high- that's a day she has to take off and doesn't get to use for something else. \n\nSo, for you, you're trying to do something nice for your SO. That is good. But for her, it can seem like you're dictating the use of her PTO, which might be in short supply. Neither of you are trying to do anything bad here, and both of you have a very reasonable take. \n\nSo, moving forward- this is a good learning experience. Your SO really values her days off, and choosing what to use them for. No more surprises like this which require her to use her days off. At the same time, her reaction could have been better. Something like \"I know you're tying to give me a nice surprise, but it in the future, know I want to discuss with you when my PTO is used.\"", "NAH\n\nYou meant well but you had no idea if she was available: Would she be working, did she have a meeting lined up with friends, etc. And it turns out she was working as she says she has to take the day off for it.\n\nPersonally I feel smaller things make for better surprises. Planning a concert is a bit more serious, especially if it's a distant one.", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong for wanting to get her something nice. \n\nShe\u2019s not wrong for thinking it\u2019d be best to communicate beforehand on something that\u2019s going to a) cost hundreds of dollars and b) possibly requiring coordination on her end for time off to be able to partake (and assuming that it\u2019s something she\u2019d want to use leave for). \n\nSimple communication issue, and an easy enough one to learn from.", "NAH, it was a nice gesture but truthfully, surprises rarely work out like we wish, because of feelings from everybody involved. You wanted to do something nice, which is great, but you made assumptions about her work, which isn't great so in the end everybody's feelings are hurt.", "Info: what does she do for work?", "You meant well, but just because you thought it would be sweet doesn't mean she has to feel the same way. She's kind of right that now she \"has\" to take a day off instead of choosing if she wants to.\n\nNext time just give her a heads up, \"would you like to go to concert on x day/time?\" and let her check her schedule.", "NAH as long as you don\u2019t get upset at her for not being able to go and that before you do something like this again, you ask if she\u2019s free and wants to go. \n\nCan totally see where she\u2019s coming from as I don\u2019t like using my time off for concerts at all. Even if it\u2019s a band I love.", "NAH. You meant to do something nice, but yes getting time off with only week's notice can be really tough and now she's in a position to feel guilty about the tickets if she can't go. Surprises can be nice, but it's best to not go for the surprise option when it involves taking time off.", "According to you she is a teacher.  \n\nA lot goes into a day off for a teacher. \n\nYTA", "Info:  was this a gift for a special occasion? Bday or anything?", "NAH\n\ni've had jobs where its easy to take time off, and i've had jobs where it isnt. only your GF knows how rough it is for her", "INFO \n\nIn my experience surprises like this are hard for some people - they feel really stressed or guilty about not being able to make it and just don\u2019t like it.

That's not cool.", "YTA. Buying the tickets was a sweet idea, but anything that requires time off and planning needs to be vetted before purchasing.  Your surprise should have been your intent to buy the tickets and make a fun date day out of it, not that you\u2019d already committed her to working out logistics on her end to satisfy the requirements of going.", "INFO: How were the tickets/gift presented to her?\n\nLike it's a pleasant opportunity she can take part in if she's free? Or \"these tickets cost so much and we should go or they're wasted\"?\n\nIf you're cool with giving/selling ticket to someone else if she's not available, I don't understand the harm. Sometimes surprises don't pay off for the other person but doesn't make you an AH about it unless her reaction was actually more about how the gift was presented.", "NAH\nShe's a teacher? And a lot goes into a day off for teachers. Substitute finding/prep, making sure the kids are at a point they can be left for the day (no tests/exams/projects coming up soon).\n\nYou wanted to do a fun thing. She probably wants to do it with you, judging by her reaction. Go, have fun, try not to rub it in her face, and definitely get her input on the next surprise. Good luck!", "YTA for saying you bought them for her. You bought them for yourself and expected her to take a day off of work to go with you after you had spent hundreds of dollars without consulting her.", "YTA for this part:\n\n> I really think that it was a dramatic reaction and a nice surprise.\n\nYou don't get to decide if she's being dramatic or not. You don't seem to be taking her and her life into consideration at all.", "NAH \n\nYou meant well but it sounds like you didn\u2019t think it through", "YTA. A gift is supposed to be enjoyable for the other person. You've now put the burden on her of taking a day off and using valuable PTO to see one of your favorite bands. Her saying \"it's a nice thought, but insensitive to assume she'd be available\" is 100% accurate and also doesn't sound like she was *\"pissed*.\" It sounds like you expected her to happily shift her life around based on a surprise gift and are annoyed that that's not how real life works.", "YTA\n\nIt's not dramatic, you meant well but didn't think what day will be the concert? And it's so far you'd be away for all day. If you wanted it to be a surprise, you could just asked if she was available that day. She's not responsible for you spending hundred of dollars without been even sure if she could attend, you're an adult, you're responsible for your own decisions. Communitacion is key in all relationships.", "I'm sorry but YTA. You can't schedule a wildly inconvenient event for someone, to experience something they feel largely indifferent toward, without talking to them first. And if you do, you can't expect a completely enthusiastic response. \n\nYou're not an irredeemable asshole or anything, but in this situation I think you're the person in the wrong.", "YTA  - ask first", "NTA but her reaction to a very thoughtful gift is concerning. The concert is in October and she can\u2019t miss one day of work 6 months from now?", "NAH - It was nice on your part but you have to accept the fact that she might not be able to or does not want to go due to work. It sounds like she overreacted, being \"*pissed*\" (unless it was because you kept insisting). If she doesn't want to go, then accept it and sell the ticket online or to a friend. If that doesn't work out, then that's the expense of assuming someone can go to a concert and buying them a ticket without asking.", "Yta - surprises aren't supposed to be: 1) what the gift giver wants. Waiting a whole day to like one band? Ugh. And 2] inconvenient. She's now taking a day off to do something she doesn't want to instead of saving it for when she wants to use it.", "YHA - although not exactly an asshole, just rather silly. As you said, live music is YOUR thing. And it was YOUR fav music groups playing. Doesn\u2019t sound like you were thinking about her likes. She said it was a nice thought so she isn\u2019t the AH either. But next time time think about her needs and wants. Is this concert really so great for her that it\u2019s worth her spending one of her days off travelling there? Time off for most people is limited. Be more aware to her needs and not so focussed on your own", "Its 6 months from now. Why would she blow up like this? Makes absolutely no sense. If she isn't able or willing to take the day off you have enough time to ask someone else or sell her ticket.\nNTA", "No you're NTA.

She's TA and overreacted", "NTA and your GF is totally blowing it out of proportion.", "NTA. If she can't go then fine. Find a friend or sell the extra ticket and go solo. It's not as if you're asking her for the money.", "Well now you get to take somebody that would actually like to go- or you can sell the ticket. \n\n\u201cHundreds of dollars\u201d for tickets without discussion would upset *me*, but the amount of money spent didn\u2019t seem to be her biggest concern at all.

If my wife said that I'd be like \"alright fine I'ma take someone else then since I have two tickets. Enjoy working\".", "NTA - is she always like this - taking offense to kind gestures?   Were you expected to make the band change nights / venues?  Or not go because it was inconvenient for her?\n\nThere are a lot of warning flags here.  Normally people would say \"I'm not available but enjoy!\"  Good luck with holiday and birthday gifts.", "NTA\n\nIf she ended not being able to go... OK and? No big deal? You could probably get a refund, sell the ticket, or bring another friend who would enjoy themselves.\n\nThere's gotta be more going in here, which she should unpack with her therapist.", "nta. nice gesture. take someone else.. where i am from teachers have a lot of flexibility..", "NTA - I DON'T understand where she's coming from.  It doesn't sound like you necessarily assumed she'd be able to take the day off, it sounds like you bought tickets in hopes that she could, and if she couldn't, you'd be fine and still be able to go yourself.  You could sell the other ticket, go with a friend - as someone who loves concerts as much as you, I'm assuming you have people in your life that also love them, and I'm assuming that you have many easy Plan B's here.  She could have said \"Thanks for the thought, but I'm not sure I can get the time off,\" and that could have been the end of it.", "NTA- I think it was a sweet gesture of you to buy tickets. I think since the show is in October it gives her enough time to request that day off from work and get things situated.

But I do hope you learn that what seems like a \"nice surprise\" to you is not necessarily  a nice surprise to someone else. Just because YOU would love it does not mean other people would love it.", "YTA, it's a cool gift, but if it's something they can't do then its a burden. If it's an all day thing (I'm going to assume it's a festival, and festivals are a big commitment) then that's more than just \"Oh we're gonna catch a show after work.\"  \n\n\nAlso; Crowd at Aftershock kinda sucks my dude. I hope you have fun though, bring a dust mask.", "NTA - She has 6 months to plan her day off. If she doesn't want to go, take a friend. I love surprise concert tickets. :)", "This is hard to judge. I can understand that for her, going to this concert involves a lot, taking the day off and traveling a good distance. And for that reason, this may not be a great gift for her. But to be pissed about it seems like a bit too much. \n\nThen again, she doesn't seemed pissed based on the description. She made sure to say it was a nice thought, and seemed more to express frustration that OP didn't think it through. And its possible that stuff like that has happened between the two of them before, and she's frustrated that OP is not listening to her, and not understanding what is involved in her life. \n\nSo I guess my vote is not enough info, as it depends on their dynamic and relationship history.", "NTA. We're talking about a date six months from now. I understand how difficult it is to get time off as a teacher, especially for something like a concert and it's perfectly valid to not want to do it. But there's no reason to get upset about something happening in six months. You can find someone else to go with or sell one of the tickets.", "YTA apparently she is a teacher, so she can\u2019t just take a random day off like you can on a lot of other jobs. \n\nYou should have asked her if she was available and spoke to her about spending hundreds of dollars on something \n\nIt was a nice gesture but it would have been even better with the correct communication so that you could actually go and enjoy the concert", "Exactly. It's a nice gesture, and on the plus side at least she has a lot of advance notice to see if she could take that day off (I know that can be a pain for teachers so I also understand if she feels it'd be more trouble than it's worth). But I feel like that's a pretty huge leap to buy tickets to something on a day where the recipient has to work or otherwise has obligations like school or taking care of someone.\n\nI know it may spoil OP's surprise a bit in their mind, but honestly the best thing to do would've been to ask her if she'd want to go, even just pose it as a hypothetical, though it'd be best to just say \"Hey remember that concert with (band)? They're coming to (city) on (date), it's a (day of the week) though. Do you think you'd be able to take time off of work to go?\" or something along those lines before buying tickets.", "Also as something she would enjoy. \nYou love the band, if there was an easy to get to concert at a convenient time then that\u2019s a really nice surprise. But let\u2019s be clear here, this is a band you live and your Gf showed mild interest in because you live it. It was a gift for you that you wanted her to enjoy too.

Getting caught taking a day to go to a concert could get the gf in big trouble depending on her district.  \n\nThen there\u2019s sub plans. I teach kindergarten, so if I take a day, I have to write out in detail exactly what I do for six hours - plus details about which kids go to speech at what time, who has IEP accommodations, who runs off from class, bathroom procedures, daily routines, and of course the actual lesson plans which I make from scratch because I can\u2019t expect a sub to do all the same stuff I would do. I have to prep all the materials and put away things I don\u2019t want used if I\u2019m not there. It honestly can take 2-3 hours to prepare for a sub, and heaven help if there\u2019s a special activity, field trip, etc. I have to be either really miserable or else contagious to take a day off school. \n\nOP is not an AH for not understanding this previously, but should be more understanding now and in the future.

He said he's understanding of her position, and doesn't seem to be trying to force her to take off work to go. He wanted to surprise her.

It's not that she can't get one off 6 months from now, but if she doesn't get many, it's using a day off for something she doesn't really want to do, meaning she doesn't get to use it later.", "Idk, if my SO spent a couple hundred on tickets without even asking if I had work that day I\u2019d be pretty frustrated too", "I was really shocked honestly because it was very out of character for her- she'll thank me a million times if I even do something like buy her a soda.", "The concert is at 6.

Worst case you can't go so they sell the tickets to someone else.", "But when did he tell her about it? The very same day, a week before?", "Perhaps because she actually likes soda? Lol", "Then maybe take this as a one-off and let it go.  You didn't do anything wrong, so if she isn't like this normally, maybe ask about her reaction when tempers defuse.", "what time would she have to leave work?", "He's not framing it that way.
