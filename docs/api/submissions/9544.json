You have a difficult baby and no family close enough to help you.  It\u2019s just a suggestion.  Your parents are very generous in even offering to help with yours and your brothers child.  They are older and have earned their retirement.  Parents don\u2019t owe it to help out with grandkids.  If you don\u2019t want to move or the help, then don\u2019t move.  No reason to get pissed off about it.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you take everything your mother says as an offence and attack. Her suggestions of trying other formulas and dummies are very genereretic suggestions. Yet you seem to take offense in these.\n\nYou also say, that you keep your mother at arms length and your wife and mother don't get along. Yet, you think they should uproot their lives for the sole purpose of helping you. It sounds like you moved away from where your parents live, and your mother was saying, that the way they could offer more help was if you moved closer to them. Yet you turn it around on her, that she and your dad should move closer to you in order to help you more.", "YTA - Maybe you'll see why if i shorten your post a bit: I think my parents are selfish because they don't want to move to help US with OUR baby.", "YTA\n\nOn this particular issue, you are wrong. The price your brother pays for getting \u201cfree\u201d child care is having to live where he lives. It\u2019s just not realistic to expect elderly parents to provide the same level of support to somebody who lives much farther away, nor is it reasonable to ask them to uproot their lives. When your mother suggested that you\u2019d have free child care if you were closer, that was actually a nice offer, albeit one that isn\u2019t terribly realistic. \n\nWhile I do think you\u2019re TA on this particular dispute, I\u2019m going to give you a lot of leeway and I\u2019m not judging you. You have a colicky baby and that\u2019s really hard. You\u2019re likely at your wits end and are stretched very thin. This stage will pass and you\u2019ll eventually be thankful that you have a manageable distance between you and your mom.", "YTA. I appreciate that you\u2019re being polite and responsive, but your attitude in your post comes across a bit r/choosingbeggar. You have every right to make your own life choices - such as having a baby when both parents work, have chronic illnesses, are > 30 (i.e. less naturally energetic), and don\u2019t live near their support systems - but you don\u2019t get to demand that others make sacrifices to support those life choices. Take your own family out of the equation and imagine a stranger told you that new parents expected the grandparents in their 70\u2019s to sell their home and move in order to supply childcare. It doesn\u2019t sound rational, does it?", "YTA\u2014 I got just about zero help with my critical/intensive care baby and know lots of people the same, so I can\u2019t give you much sympathy. I wish my family members had come and help me, but I can\u2019t call them all AHs for not or I\u2019d have zero family or friends now. \n\nIs it unfair your brother got free babysitting? Not really. The cost of it was not moving away and putting up with the woman you would rather keep at an arm\u2019s length. And fair almost never comes into it anyway\u2014 if your mom had gotten sick or injured in the past 6 years, then your kid wouldn\u2019t have got free babysitting anyway. It\u2019s often the case the older grandkid gets the younger grandma and more babysitting than the youngest one.", "Honestly... yes YTA. \n\nSounds like you moved away, not them. Why should they have to follow you? Sounds like they already make a pretty decent effort to visit you. If you want more help then yes, you should move to get it if they're willing to give it.\n\nFor perspective, some of us are disabled and raising our kids with no help from grandparents. Unbelievable how many \"adults\" on reddit think that their parents are responsible for them and their children when they're grown.", "hmmm. I say, YTA. \n\nNot wanting to entirely pick up and move is totally reasonable. It would be unrealistic to just pick up and move right now. Especially if you're happy with your jobs and where you are. And, no, just because you're brother is nearby your parents, doesn't mean you need to be haha. But I'm not entirely sure if she is \"selfish\" for offering the suggestion to move closer. \n\nShe suggested it so that you'd have help with your baby. And like you pointed out, your brother is nearby them. And your parents help with their child too. She probably doesn't want to just pick up and abandon them either. Having you both nearby probably makes more sense, so that everyone can get help at the same time. \n\nAsking them, elderly people, who help take care of your siblings children when they need it, to just pick up and move closer to you, seems unreasonable. That's a lot on an elderly person and it would take childcare and help that your brother (and his daughter) have relied on. \n\nIn reality, it's just that it isn't a good option for you guys, it sounds like. But I don't think she was being selfish in her suggestion.", "YTA. She wasn\u2019t being selfish, she was offering an option. On the other hand, OP asking mum to move WAS selfish.", "YTA for calling her selfish, you can move or not. She's right that if you moved closer they may be able to offer more help. They're not obligated to help you and you're not obligated to move. \n\nThey're not obligated to move to help you, they're not obligated to help you at all. Your work, health, baby, etc is not their responsibility to help with or manage. Saying they would be willing to help you if you moved closer is an option, you're free to discard that option.", "YTA, no you are not obliged to move, but your parents are not obliged to help you either. If your mother indicates that the distance is difficult, then it is. That she doesn't want to stay overnight, that's up to your mother to decide for herself.\nHelp is nice, but they don't have to adapt to you.", "YTA. Some babies are such hard work, so you get my sympathy. Any help your mother gives you should be appreciated but not expected. The way you\u2019ve written your list sounds like it is your right to have her help you.  She doesn\u2019t have to help you. Even if she is helping your brother. \n\nYou say your mum and wife don\u2019t get on, so I think it is  kind of her to be helping out in any capacity (I say this as someone who has an absolutely awful MIL). \n\n- Expecting her to travel long distances to help YOU out is incredibly unreasonable. \n\n- I don\u2019t think your parents financial situation is relevant. It should have no bearing on whether she should provide care for you or not. Yes it makes it more feasible for her to do so, but doesn\u2019t mean she has to.\n\n- you say you offered her a single bed in a box room\u2026 From the way you wrote it, it sounds like you think this is a sweet deal for her (?) \nIt sounds very uncomfortable, especially after a long drive. I\u2019d just pay for a hotel room to be honest. \n\n- Lastly, you mentioned that if the baby wasn\u2019t so difficult you would not be having the conversation. Does that mean that you would have limited contact with her? After all- you mentioned you have to \u201ckeep her at arms length.\u201d It sounds like you are using her, because you need her. Otherwise she would have limited contact. \n\nI do feel for you - having a colicky baby and a passive aggressive mother are all frustrating. I had a colicky first baby and a passive aggressive know-it-all MIL at the same time. We sent the MIL packing after 2 days. Hang in there- it does get better (the baby, not the mother). The general trend is that the second one is an angel.", "I\u2019ve been where you are. The good news is- it gets better. My son was a miserable baby. He had reflux. He was preemie and for the first 4 months of his life he never rested peacefully. He needed to be rocked and bounced. He\u2019d get to sleep and then you\u2019d hear that little click in his throat and his face would turn bright red and he\u2019d scream from the pain of the reflux. We tried everything. Then we visited my family and my mom suggested we try this stuff for stroke patients in his bottle. It\u2019s basically cornstarch and thickened his milk. It was magic. And then one day, he slept. Peacefully. It was beautiful and it was only then we realized just how hard it was. But I think when it was happening we were so exhausted that we didn\u2019t take our time to find the medicine or formula to help him. We were in survival mode. When my daughter came almost 5 years later, we were older and wiser. We also had moved closer to family and that helped. She was an absolute dream. Until 2 months. She was colicky and it was awful. The first thing we did was listen to my mom and switch to soy. It took about 48 hours and then we got our happy baby back. She had a milk allergy. She outgrew it as a lot of infants do, but we kept her off of it until she was over a year. My point(s) in telling you this are:\nParenting is hard. Listen to others suggestions. Sometimes the simplest change makes a huge difference. \nHaving parents and family around is a huge help. Your mom was trying to help. I understand how stressed and exhausted you are and how you reacted was a normal response. But you should apologize now. You don\u2019t need to pack up and move tomorrow, but I would think about relocating to be near supportive family when things calm down and get easier. \nI really will get better. Deep breaths. It really is worth it and when she\u2019s settled and colic is gone, you\u2019re going to have a happy, beautiful little girl.", "NAH. \n\nSounds like your last point is the answer - everyone is tired and overwhelmed, there was no malicious intent. There's only so much your mom can do from a distance,  after all, except offer advice and I can see why she would snap after constantly being told \"we've tried that,  what else?\"\n\nThough you are bordering on entitled whining that your mom is not helping more,  doesn't want to stay in the box room,  your brother gets more help etc,  even though you think she's controlling and are keeping her at arms length. Can't have it both ways. I am giving the benefit of the doubt that's also baby stress.", "YTA the person who needs the help is the one who makes concessions on their location.\n\nIn addition they are close to your brother. You chose to live 90 minutes away. Hire someone to help if you need it. Also consider a consult with a pediatric GI to evaluate your child.", "YTA. First and foremost, you and your wife chose to have the baby. It shouldn\u2019t be anybody else\u2019s responsibility to \u201chelp\u201d you with the kid. Any help offered by anybody else is not their obligation to you. You should\u2019ve thought and talked about how it\u2019s going to be once the baby was here. I get it babies are unpredictable. But there\u2019s two of you and one baby, and the baby is four months, much less fragile than a newborn. Second, Your mother offered FREE help, but does that mean she should uproot her life to help you out? I think not. Her offering to help you out and you wanting her to move is the definition of \u201cgive an inch, they take a mile\u201d. Yeah I get it, moving your family is difficult, but your mother is SEVENTY, what makes it easier for her? Your brother\u2019s children being taken care of by your mother is a PRIVILEGE they have because they are nearer.", "YTA. It reads like you and your mother have some long-standing issues, but getting mad because she suggested you move closer seems completely uncalled for. Also, the idea of expecting 70 yr olds to uproot their financial lives in this economy to move closer to help you with your child in infancy seems a bit much.", "It's the person in need who must compromise and make the move. Her life is good. Yours is not. Why should she leave her home, leave her other grandchild, leave her social life and make all that sacrifice for you? You on the other hand is drowning and need the help and is suffering without it.  So if you need help then go get it", "NTA. Reading it, it sounds a little like you\u2019ve made a mountain out of a mole hill, but based on the way you describe your mother, I imagine it\u2019s the straw that broke the camels back. I\u2019d also be a bit reticent to have her that close by. Yes it would be a help, but at what cost? She clearly thinks she knows best, how long until she autonomously starts doing things / making decisions about the babies care without your consent?", "NTA. You don't have to move nor do your parents. I do get the feeling the only reason you said that, was because she was already telling you what to do instead of actually listening to you. \n\nHaving said that, I don't get what the problem with the distance is. My parents and PIL both life that far away. They each help one day every fortnight. If you mom is willing to help, she needs to compromise as well. Both parties need to find a middle ground. Help is never solely on the conditions of one party. If she doesn't want to help. That is okey too. However, then she shouldn't say things like \"if you lived closer we could help etc.\". She is aware of the fact you live 90 miles away and that neither of you want to move. Then she needs to let the topic rest and just be a listening ear to you.", "NTA thats my MIL , all talk. Hang in there with the colicky baby, it gets better.", "I'd have to say you're NTA based on your description of your mother. I also didn't think you were serious about expecting your parents to move closer, since you do want them at a distance. You don't want to be what Ray Barone described as the \"hot zone.\"\n\nThe good news is this will pass. The baby will overcome her colic, you will start getting sleep again. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.", "NTA. - However, I don\u2019t see that particular line of defense helpful. It is normal, for this question about grandparents helping out to bubble up given your situation with the baby. The distance between you and  your parents maybe a good thing. I know from experience a challenging baby is a world changer, and can make time seem to go by really slowly.  That can change though, sometimes the baby\u2019s disposition can change - they reach some developmental milestone and stop being so fussy. I hope that happens for you. If I was in your situation I think I would want to tough-through and not have either of you move. It seems like if either of you moved it could create resentments. Is there anything else you guys can try to do to try and get some help or a break?", "NAH. You sound exhausted and are clearly dealing with a lot. \n\nI have no idea whether your mum was purposely making petty suggestions, or if she genuinely thought she was being helpful.\n\nGive yourself a break. Your mum was making an impractical suggestion, so you made one back. You were both being a little silly. \n\nHowever, these weekly phone calls are clearly upsetting you. It\u2019s hard to repeat the same shit every week \u2018*yes we\u2019ve tried that, no it hasn\u2019t worked\u2019*\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to have to relay the same upsetting information week in and week out.\n\nMaybe it would be best to reduce phone calls  for a while and send picture updates via WhatsApp.", "NTA, 90 minutes away isn\u2019t that far when you\u2019re retired, have your health and can drive. Maybe they can\u2019t help as much as the sibling who lives closer. What\u2019s the point of family that doesn\u2019t help each other?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
