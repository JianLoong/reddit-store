We have decided to have a smallish wedding with close family and friends (about 20 people in total) and have also put an age restriction that the guests should be over the age of 12 in order to attend (this was the restriction and me and my partner have realised we have a lot of niblings and cousins under the age of 12 that would blow our number to 40-50+ easily). The next day we were planning on having a pizza/BBQ event for the rest of the family and friends with all the kids invited, so they can have food suitable for their age and not get bored.\n\nIt is also important that I have no relationship with my birth father. While my other siblings hang out with him on a weekly basis, there are some things he has done that made me to cut him off permanently from my life. Due to this having my mother at my wedding was very important to me as she would be walking me down the isle. Not sure how important this will be, but I am first among my 5 siblings to marry.\n\nOn the day of the wedding my sister \"Sarah\" has showed up with her kids, 14f \"Miley\"who was our flower girl and 5m \"Dilan\". I assumed she will drop drop my nephew off by the time the ceremony starts, but she hasn't. I have reminded her that the venue does not allow children under 12 and have asked if her babysitter was late. Sarah told me that she doesn't have the babysitter and she thought our mum will look after Dilan while she is watching the wedding. \n\nI said it is not possible as our mum is an important guest, I need her and she hasn't signed up to be a free babysitter for my sister whenever she needs one. I have also told Sarah that if she doesn't have anyone to look after Dilan, she can look after himself since he won't be allowed to the venue.\n\nMy sister has called me a bridezilla and an asshole before leaving with Dilan. She has tried to take Miley with her, but Miley refused to go and our mum dropped her off later that day.
