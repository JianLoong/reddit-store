What world do you live in where you think OP hates autistic children because she needs time to grove her dead sister? It was inappropriate for her to be asked anyway.", "her not helping out is not equating to hating autistic children, holy shit. that is an insane reach. again, the group could have been cancelled. no one\u2019s problems are more important than anyone else\u2019s and if no one could do it, then they could have just not done the group that day.", "In what world do you live in that allows less than 1 week?", "Absolutely not. I don\u2019t doubt that being a parent to a special needs child is difficult, but that is not OP\u2019s problem or anyone else\u2019s. OP deserves time to grieve her sister without an entitled coworker harassing her. It doesn\u2019t matter if she had already been dead for a few days or a few weeks. It was the day of her funeral.

I forgive the one with the migraine because that can be like someone just tortured you with the cruciatus spell, but the ones who felt uncomfortable? Assholes, it's an emergency!

I hope HR stands by your side if not, consider legal actions!\n\nI'm sorry for your loss and hope you stay strong.\u2764\ufe0f Cancer sucks. One of the worst disease in existence.", "NTA. ABSOLUTELY talk to HR about this! You were away on bereavement leave and your manager decided she needed a \"mental health\" day? Fuck all of that. She had no right to harass you while you were off duty, and saying what she said about your sister passing was disgustingly cruel and insulting.

This is so incredibly bad. Please come in with printed text messages and a record of everything that was said to you and lay it all out for HR.

I'm sorry you had to go through that.", "NTA. The only thing you did wrong was opening up a conversation with these psychos.

You're on time off. End of story. NTA", "NTA, let them bring HR into it, if HR get it wrong you'll still win at tribunal.

There's no way you'd be in any state mentally to do so", "Good oogly moogly. Send your resume out. It's time to leave that toxic shitshow of a place.

My job honestly treats us like crap but even they let me have a week off (even though I was out of vacation days) when my uncle passed away suddenly so I could go back home to Canada to attend the funeral and spend some time with my family. At that was for my *uncle* this is OP\u2019s *sister* and they had to fight for the PTO to go home.

Yes it's backwards and unfair, but if we get sick or aren't reachable then the clients, who are already super vulnerable, suffer. In some cases leaving them without support simply isn't an option (kids). So many of us work through illness and never take holidays. I went 8 years working 80+ hour weeks without a week off or a holiday. Aside from the 8 months I had off following a client seriously assaulting me, and even then I was back to work before I should have been because I was seriously needed. Any other industry and I'd be on the 'tell them to get fucked' bandwagon, but you can't have that attitude in this sector.", "OP never downplayed it.

Speaking of utter lack of empathy...\n\nI'm so fucking grateful right now I live in a country where the supervisor's behaviour would get her at least a warning. Having a special needs child is not an excuse for incompetence, unprofessionalism and especially not for dumping your issues on innocent bystanders and trying to make them responsible.
