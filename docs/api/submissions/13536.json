What they don't understand is empathy.", "Oooooh hell no! I hope it was said in writing so you could report them to someone.", "Yes, do all of this. They want an HR meeting, well okay, let\u2019s see how great they look when presented with your PTO approval and their messages. You were at your sister\u2019s _**funeral**_ reception and none of them could lead or cancel a meeting? Come on.", "Lots of places allow a week or bereavement leave for siblings. What world do you live in where you think OP hates autistic children because she needs time to grove her dead sister? It was inappropriate for her to be asked anyway.", "her not helping out is not equating to hating autistic children, holy shit. that is an insane reach. again, the group could have been cancelled. no one\u2019s problems are more important than anyone else\u2019s and if no one could do it, then they could have just not done the group that day.", "In what world do you live in that allows less than 1 week?", "Absolutely not. I don\u2019t doubt that being a parent to a special needs child is difficult, but that is not OP\u2019s problem or anyone else\u2019s. OP deserves time to grieve her sister without an entitled coworker harassing her. It doesn\u2019t matter if she had already been dead for a few days or a few weeks. It was the day of her funeral. Being a parent doesn\u2019t give you the right to be a thoughtless asshole or the right to anyone else\u2019s time, and the other coworkers had already been trained.", "You\u2019re an AH for not having a heart. As a mom of an autistic kid, we don\u2019t get passes for parenting. You suck it up and deal, adapt as necessary. If one solution is unavailable, go to the next. And don\u2019t tell anyone how to grieve, either.", "So OP sucks? In what way exactly? Because you definitely sound like an AH here", "[removed]", "No it\u2019s not her problem. You\u2019d be unfit to be a supervisor if you fired OP in a situation like this. And fuck off with this village bullshit. People don\u2019t have to be part of your village if they don\u2019t want to.  You sound beyond entitled.", "Firing an employee for being on approved bereavement leave? \n\nEnjoy the lawsuit lol"]}
