Business is doing great; well beyond what I thought I was capable of doing. Since I started running my own business my husband has been dropping daily reminders to me every single day with shit he wants me to do. Stuff I already do and don't need to be reminded to do. Like grocery shopping, for instance. Or bringing the dog out, as if I need a reminder to do so. I'm a very organized person and have a calenders that I fill in daily of everything that I need to do, which includes my business, and I manage to get everything done and then some. But every single time he shouts out reminders it makes me not want to do anything.\n\nReason for this is because once again, I'm the organized one and I have never needed reminders but he on the other hand will not do absolutely anything without 18 reminders and forcing his hand. Even then he will try procrastinating and not doing it until super late in the evening, where he either asks me for help or complains the whole time because he is tired. \n\nSo I've told him several times to stop giving me basic reminders about things because it's irritating and not helpful at all. I told him that instead he should start putting alarms on his own phone to remind himself about the things he needs to do, not me. Regardless, he has not stopped reminding me to do things. So yesterday when he sent a text saying \"Don't forget that it's grocery day and make sure Lulu gets her eye drops at noon.\" I don't respond. He then texts like 20 minutes later and says \"Oh, also remember to start the laundry before I get home because we have that event tomorrow.\" I texted him at this point and said \"I've told you repeatedly to stop sending me daily reminders, especially considering you know I am already on top of all of this and have everything done already. Do what you need to do instead of worrying about me because I guarantee you still haven't gotten your oil change that you were supposed to get three days ago or filed your paperwork from last week, which is on your calender. Keep reminding me to do things and I will stop doing anything around this house.\" He then says I'm ignorant for not reminding him sooner and that him reminding me is his way of telling me that he needs reminders.

Tell him that you will no longer be listening to, reading, or responding to messages that are reminders. Either that or start giving him similarly helpful reminders. Maybe the next time you\u2019re in a public place and he heads to the restroom, yell after him \u201cDon\u2019t forget to wipe!\u201d (That\u2019s probably terrible advice, but it might get the point across.)\n\nYou have your act together. He doesn\u2019t. \n\nThat being said, it sure sounds like your relationship has a strange dynamic. I don\u2019t see it getting better anytime soon.", "Please google DARVO. \n\nThis dude is a huge AH. He doesn't need to send you constant reminders and micromanage your life, and he doesn't need YOU to micromanage his. \n\nHe needs to deal with this issue. This would be a really, really big issue for me- I don't do well with controlling personalities.", "NTA. You've heard of the term 'weaponised incompetence', right? \n\nThe justification of \"it's your fault, I need you to remind me more\" is straight out of the textbook -- it foists the burden of emotional labour/being the household project manager onto you. I think there could also be an element of him wanting to feel like he's in control of ***some***thing. (Which I guess would be... you.)", "NTA\n\nSorry you are in this situation. \"I remind you because I want you to remind me\" is a gaslighting thing, to make you question if you're in the wrong - and the fact that you are here asking this question shows it's working, at least a little bit.\n\nDo not be confused. You are NTA. \n\nThere's a difference between \"doing to\" and \"doing for.\" He's doing something to you that you want to stop. He absolutely should stop. He wants you to do something for him. He can ask, not demand. And you can decide to what extent you are willing to do that for him.\n\nIf you explain this to him and he refuses to accept it and make the necessary changes, then you are married to a toxic person.", "NTA. How can he remember things you need to do but not things he needs to do?", "If he needs a personal assistant, he should hire one and divorce you. He won't be getting sex, but he'll be able to give all the passive-aggressive petty little reminders he wants until the PA quits on his ass, too. \n\nNTA. Marriage requires people who work together to find compromise, and his refusal to acknowledge your desire indicates a complete lack thereof.", "NTA. What type of backwards logic does your husband have. He reminds you, so he gets reminders. He is a grown ass man , who should be fully capable of setting a goddamn phone alarm, and not bothering you.", "What in the world? lol That is very odd logic. I'm reminding you constantly of things so you'll remind me of my things? No, man. Remind yourself and leave me be. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nThis sounds like an acute case of fragile masculinity.\n\nI'm guessing your husband is insecure that your business is doing so well, and he's increasingly feeling an inferiority complex because you have superior organizational skills and are profiting from them. So, he's projecting that insecurity onto you by trying to \"keep you in your place,\" acting like you've somehow developed incompetence and need to be reminded to do your \"wifely\" chores.\n\nIt also deflects from his true, underlying issue of not being able to achieve the same level of organization as you, and perhaps another underlying issue in that he realizes his self-motivational skills aren't as developed as yours, and maybe it affects his career advancement; so he's assigned himself the extremely unnecessary role as your manager instead of addressing his own deficits.\n\nI would suggest putting your phone on DnD during the day and/or muting his notifications. He isn't going to stop \"reminding\" you no matter how aggravated you feel, because HE feels better when he does it. It makes him feel like \"the boss\" and \"the provider\" instead of just another joe worker type who's getting lapped by his wife who's managing everything easily. Muting him will force him to deal with his own feelings in the moment.\n\nFrankly, I would also absolutely suggest not doing the damn laundry or grocery shopping until \"after work hours\" and drag his ass along with you, so he can participate in managing his own household.\n\nAfter work, I would insist on a family meeting to seriously ask him WHY he's doing it. Why does he think you suddenly need to be reminded to do the things you clearly already know how to do? Why does he keep doing it after you've told him to stop?\n\nAnd don't let him off the hook with some bullshit answer, either, or deflect as to how he thinks you're going to start dropping the ball. Because, as you've mentioned already, he drops the ball on his chores all the time, so clearly ball-dropping isn't some unforgivable offense or a sign that one isn't entitled to pursue their business goals. It would sound ludicrous if he tried to explain that when he forgets to get his oil changed for the 10th time, it's because he's a busy provider with a job, but if you fail to get the groceries because you're doing your business, it's a sign that you're not capable of business. Especially if you're not actually forgetting the groceries!\n\nThe point you should be hammering home is his projection and his potential double standards.\n\nAnd if that doesn't sink in, then marital counseling may be in order, so a paid professional can tell him where the bears shit in the woods.", "His reasoning sounds weird, what's so hard about \"Hey honey, I need more reminders\" instead of acting like an AH, are you supposed to guess what he's thinking?\n\nNTA, but your ~~bf~~ husband definitely is.", "NTA, you guys need to have a discussion about how to deal with reminders for him and how you will deal with reminders for yourself. And maybe he just needs to find new things to talk about, if he\u2019s just reminding you \u201cto make conversation.\u201d", "NTA...I wonder if he thinks because you are now working from home for yourself, that you now qualify as a \"stay at home spouse.\"  Otherwise, he should just be reminding himself.  Disregard his reminders and concentrate on your successful business. Best of luck.", "None of this is about the little jobs that need doing, it\u2019s about power. Your successful business and ability to run a house alongside it has shown your husband that he is pretty useless. He feels emasculated by your success and, since he has nothing to offer the business in terms of advice, he feels the need to be more masculine around things at home in order to feel like he is in charge. The only way he can do that is by offering pointless reminders. \n\nHave a look at masculine and feminine polarity", "NTA, its very convoluted way of saying he is the one that needs reminders", "NTA - what he is doing is called projecting. It's not you who needs reminders but him. Next time when he starts to \"remind you\" cut him off and remind him of all the things he needs to do that day. Or before he has time to \"remind you\" tell him what he needs to sccomplish for the day. It may be frustrating for you but it could stop his reminders and get him on track for success. Follow up with a text list of those reminders. Remind him he can refer to the text all day.", "NTA. This situation is so weird, and I don't even buy the explanation that \"he's reminding OP because he wants reminders from OP.\" How is he capable of remembering what he wants to remind OP, but he can't remember the things he wants OP to remind him? As if his brain just can't hold onto \"you need to do your oil change\" but it can come up with \"OP needs to do laundry?\" \n\nSo it feels even more to me like there's an unspoken emotional component here, whether that's weaponized incompetence, being controlling, passive aggressive against the business, or more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
