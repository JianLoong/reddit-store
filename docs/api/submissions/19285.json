So my grocery bill would increase because I\u2019d have to make it up in animal products. Who\u2019s going to pay for that? I\u2019m not vegetarian but I don\u2019t really want to eat like that and I definitely don\u2019t want to pay for it so would they make up that increase?\r  \n\r  \n\\- I honestly didn\u2019t trust them to stop there. i already did what I felt was a reasonable accommodation and it wasn\u2019t enough so how long til they take coconut, eggs and tomatoes from me too?\r  \n\r  \n\\- It was weird af to ask me in the first place and I felt really disrespected because this is my home and I don\u2019t take second place to a guest. I can to her, personally, of course but that doesn\u2019t extend to the apartment.\r  \n\r  \nI said I would agree to continue not using his serious allergens when he was present or soon to be and that was the line. It didn\u2019t go over well at all and Layla told me I was overreacting and I could just do it and kept talking over me when I tried to say that I wouldn\u2019t. Eventually she slipped up with the \u201cwell what if he moved in\u201d and I said absolutely not and ended the conversation with her for the night.\r  \n\r  \nWe argued in circles about it for nearly 2 weeks and once it was out, she didn\u2019t drop it. I realized it wasn\u2019t going to get better so I did what I didn\u2019t want to do and told her that I was going to the landlord about breaking my part of the lease and she freaked out. Idk where Kyle\u2019s money goes but apparently he doesn\u2019t have any because she was yelling about not being able to afford it on her own and he couldn\u2019t help even if he moved in. I told her that this had gone way too far and I didn\u2019t think I could be happy living here with her anymore; if it were easier for her to leave instead, that would be fine too. She was really upset and I said I wouldn\u2019t force her out or leave her suddenly on the lease alone but it was one or the other. Eventually she accepted it and decided she would move back in with her dad. That was the end of April and she\u2019s fully moved out as of this week.\r  \n\r  \nMy childhood best friend Allie has been flip flopping on moving to my city for forever now and me calling and saying I had an cheap open bedroom if she came right away got her to finally pull the trigger on it. And it helped Layla out because she didn\u2019t have to pay to break the lease since I agreed to cover the full rent at my own risk. Allie has stuff to tie up in our home state still but she\u2019s already sent me half of July\u2019s rent. I just gotta squeeze for a lil while but I\u2019ll make it. I\u2019m super excited to see her and show her around! Plus we\u2019ve been cooking together since fourth grade so that\u2019ll be a nice change lol. and I can get a cat! It\u2019s been a bit of a rough couple of months but I\u2019m very happy with how things are looking right now so I just wanted to share with you guys.", "created_utc": 1686234266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144ap40/update_aita_for_telling_my_roommate_that_i_dont/", "score": 6866, "replies": ["So she was expecting YOU to pay for him to live there as well if he moved in?
