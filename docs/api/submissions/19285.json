So my grocery bill would increase because I\u2019d have to make it up in animal products. Who\u2019s going to pay for that? I\u2019m not vegetarian but I don\u2019t really want to eat like that and I definitely don\u2019t want to pay for it so would they make up that increase?\r  \n\r  \n\\- I honestly didn\u2019t trust them to stop there. i already did what I felt was a reasonable accommodation and it wasn\u2019t enough so how long til they take coconut, eggs and tomatoes from me too?\r  \n\r  \n\\- It was weird af to ask me in the first place and I felt really disrespected because this is my home and I don\u2019t take second place to a guest. I can to her, personally, of course but that doesn\u2019t extend to the apartment.\r  \n\r  \nI said I would agree to continue not using his serious allergens when he was present or soon to be and that was the line. It didn\u2019t go over well at all and Layla told me I was overreacting and I could just do it and kept talking over me when I tried to say that I wouldn\u2019t. Eventually she slipped up with the \u201cwell what if he moved in\u201d and I said absolutely not and ended the conversation with her for the night.\r  \n\r  \nWe argued in circles about it for nearly 2 weeks and once it was out, she didn\u2019t drop it. I realized it wasn\u2019t going to get better so I did what I didn\u2019t want to do and told her that I was going to the landlord about breaking my part of the lease and she freaked out. Idk where Kyle\u2019s money goes but apparently he doesn\u2019t have any because she was yelling about not being able to afford it on her own and he couldn\u2019t help even if he moved in. I told her that this had gone way too far and I didn\u2019t think I could be happy living here with her anymore; if it were easier for her to leave instead, that would be fine too. She was really upset and I said I wouldn\u2019t force her out or leave her suddenly on the lease alone but it was one or the other. Eventually she accepted it and decided she would move back in with her dad. That was the end of April and she\u2019s fully moved out as of this week.\r  \n\r  \nMy childhood best friend Allie has been flip flopping on moving to my city for forever now and me calling and saying I had an cheap open bedroom if she came right away got her to finally pull the trigger on it. And it helped Layla out because she didn\u2019t have to pay to break the lease since I agreed to cover the full rent at my own risk. Allie has stuff to tie up in our home state still but she\u2019s already sent me half of July\u2019s rent. I just gotta squeeze for a lil while but I\u2019ll make it. I\u2019m super excited to see her and show her around! Plus we\u2019ve been cooking together since fourth grade so that\u2019ll be a nice change lol. and I can get a cat! It\u2019s been a bit of a rough couple of months but I\u2019m very happy with how things are looking right now so I just wanted to share with you guys.", "created_utc": 1686234266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144ap40/update_aita_for_telling_my_roommate_that_i_dont/", "score": 1388, "replies": ["So she was expecting YOU to pay for him to live there as well if he moved in?

Good for you for holding your ground.", "So glad this worked out OP, and that you drew strong boundaries and STUCK TO THEM.", "Kyle sounds like a real catch.", "Glad it worked out - your ex roommate sounds like an idiot giving up her apartment for some broke guy she's only been dating  for 6 months. Good riddance", "Lmao.\n\nI knew this was their attempt  of slowly moving the bf in.\n\nGood on OP for dying on this hill.", "Good for you for holding your ground. It\u2019s obvious from your conversations with her that you were correct in assuming they wouldn\u2019t have stopped there with the demands. I think it\u2019s very likely they were trying to set the stage for him to move in completely and what was holding that plan up was you keeping those ingredients in the house. She f\u2019d around and found out. Hopefully she\u2019ll have plenty of time to think while at her dads house about what an entitled brat she is and not put any future roommates through the same type of bs. Even if she does though- not your circus, not your monkeys!", "Glad everything worked out for you! I remember reading your original post (and got downvoted to hell for my comment, which I still stand by), but it sounds like you really worked out a way to maturely (on your end, anyways) discuss this.

Which means that, legally, you are on the hook for ALL the rent every month. You trust your BFF to pay her half because you have known each other forever, right? But, sh\\*t happens and friendships can be strained when $ enters the equation. I strongly recommend you get Allie on the lease ASAP so that she has to pay her rent to the landlord and not to you. It may prevent big problems in the future.", ">\tand I can get a cat! \n\nThis is the best part of your update, congrats!", "Right, it\u2019s the audacity for me.", "That's the part that really stood out to me!!", "Thank you.

Especially when she realises your having a blast with your friend, and she can't even have sleepovers with her bf anymore.", "> Eventually she slipped up with the \u201cwell what if he moved in\u201d \n\nDid we honestly expect that would go any other way?\n\nShe was trying to get the accommodations for him the entire time, there was no mention of Layla going to his place.\nShe tried it.", "Even though you had to put up with a fair amount of stress for a while, this ultimately turned out in your favour.

It\u2019s crazy that she wanted to move her annoying BROKE boyfriend in.", "Wow what a ride. Glad it ended well for you. \nI wasn't around for the first part, but as a person who is highly allergic to tree nuts, I cannot understand the audacity of your ex roommate and the bf. \nI have always understood that I am responsible for my health and body, and I just stay away if I know I'll be exposed. Asking others to help is one thing, but trying to control your diet and home? Utterly ridiculous.", "Seemed like a very reasonable conclusion", "Thanks for the update.  So glad they left.  She wants to move in someone that is not on the lease, have him pay nothing, you need to adjust your life around them.  They would have made the last part of the lease a living hell for you.  As for the cat check out the local shelter, older cats make awesome pets, they are already litter trained and usually have outgrown the destructive stage.", "Really though.

Good job OP squashed that flat before it happened. \n\nWhat is it with entitled roommates thinking that they can move someone in without consulting or getting consent from their other roommate/s? Yea, you may live there, but so do they and they have a say in who lives in their space too.", "Well, it\u2019s only fair, reeeeeeallly. I mean, he *IS* allergic.

Smh.", "edit: The comment below was removed, good work everyone!", "Wouldn\u2019t shock me if the reasoning behind getting OP to stop eating any of the boyfriend\u2019s allergens at any time was because they felt entitled to OP\u2019s groceries and didn\u2019t want her to \u201cwaste\u201d her grocery budget on things they wouldn\u2019t be able to eat", "Even then, I bet her boyfriend probably didn't go to a lot of sleepovers at other people's houses back then.", "Thanks.

Best case scenario there's silly annoying fights now and then, worst case scenario end of friendship. There's really only one friend I trust to live with with no problems atp. So look out for yourself and your friendship at the beginning itself, lay out both of your rules, hard nos, sharing of labour etc as soon as she arrives. That way it's not awkward and no one ends up seething silently!\n\n\nI'd also suggest taking into consideration of the possible changes in the both of you cuz I'm sure you both are different people now as compared to a time when you spent significant amount of time together, on a regular basis. \n\n\nGood luck :)", "Sober or after smoking fat doinks?

It depends a lot how the friendship works in general, though... we virtually never quarreled in the first place, and we also spent a year living in separate places a few blocks away from each other before we moved in together, so that we could test out spending a lot of time in each other's pockets and make sure it worked before we committed.", "\"Smoking fat doinks\" just set me right off haha", "Literally only this story so yeah... you're right"]}
