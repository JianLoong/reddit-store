{"id": 19285, "submission_id": "144ap40", "title": "UPDATE - AITA for telling my roommate that I don\u2019t give a fuck about her boyfriends allergies?", "selftext": "I sat down with Layla a few days after my initial post and really talked with her about why I felt her and Kyle's request was unacceptable and I laid out my biggest concerns -\r  \n\r  \n\\- I eat mostly plants so nuts & soy are like 50% of my protein. So my grocery bill would increase because I\u2019d have to make it up in animal products. Who\u2019s going to pay for that? I\u2019m not vegetarian but I don\u2019t really want to eat like that and I definitely don\u2019t want to pay for it so would they make up that increase?\r  \n\r  \n\\- I honestly didn\u2019t trust them to stop there. i already did what I felt was a reasonable accommodation and it wasn\u2019t enough so how long til they take coconut, eggs and tomatoes from me too?\r  \n\r  \n\\- It was weird af to ask me in the first place and I felt really disrespected because this is my home and I don\u2019t take second place to a guest. I can to her, personally, of course but that doesn\u2019t extend to the apartment.\r  \n\r  \nI said I would agree to continue not using his serious allergens when he was present or soon to be and that was the line. It didn\u2019t go over well at all and Layla told me I was overreacting and I could just do it and kept talking over me when I tried to say that I wouldn\u2019t. Eventually she slipped up with the \u201cwell what if he moved in\u201d and I said absolutely not and ended the conversation with her for the night.\r  \n\r  \nWe argued in circles about it for nearly 2 weeks and once it was out, she didn\u2019t drop it. I realized it wasn\u2019t going to get better so I did what I didn\u2019t want to do and told her that I was going to the landlord about breaking my part of the lease and she freaked out. Idk where Kyle\u2019s money goes but apparently he doesn\u2019t have any because she was yelling about not being able to afford it on her own and he couldn\u2019t help even if he moved in. I told her that this had gone way too far and I didn\u2019t think I could be happy living here with her anymore; if it were easier for her to leave instead, that would be fine too. She was really upset and I said I wouldn\u2019t force her out or leave her suddenly on the lease alone but it was one or the other. Eventually she accepted it and decided she would move back in with her dad. That was the end of April and she\u2019s fully moved out as of this week.\r  \n\r  \nMy childhood best friend Allie has been flip flopping on moving to my city for forever now and me calling and saying I had an cheap open bedroom if she came right away got her to finally pull the trigger on it. And it helped Layla out because she didn\u2019t have to pay to break the lease since I agreed to cover the full rent at my own risk. Allie has stuff to tie up in our home state still but she\u2019s already sent me half of July\u2019s rent. I just gotta squeeze for a lil while but I\u2019ll make it. I\u2019m super excited to see her and show her around! Plus we\u2019ve been cooking together since fourth grade so that\u2019ll be a nice change lol. and I can get a cat! It\u2019s been a bit of a rough couple of months but I\u2019m very happy with how things are looking right now so I just wanted to share with you guys.", "created_utc": 1686234266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144ap40/update_aita_for_telling_my_roommate_that_i_dont/", "score": 272, "replies": ["So she was expecting YOU to pay for him to live there as well if he moved in?

Good on you OP for standing up for yourself.  Once he moved in (without paying) you would have had to keep making concessions, I wouldn't be surprised if they tried sticking you with the increase in utility bills, etc...  Both of them are entitled leaches.", "Layla sounds like a real winner. Glad you dodged that bullet, and especially glad that your childhood friend is moving in! Good for you for holding your ground.", "So glad this worked out OP, and that you drew strong boundaries and STUCK TO THEM.", "Kyle sounds like a real catch.", "Glad it worked out - your ex roommate sounds like an idiot giving up her apartment for some broke guy she's only been dating  for 6 months. Good riddance", "Lmao.\n\nI knew this was their attempt  of slowly moving the bf in.\n\nGood on OP for dying on this hill.", "Good for you for holding your ground. It\u2019s obvious from your conversations with her that you were correct in assuming they wouldn\u2019t have stopped there with the demands. I think it\u2019s very likely they were trying to set the stage for him to move in completely and what was holding that plan up was you keeping those ingredients in the house. She f\u2019d around and found out. Hopefully she\u2019ll have plenty of time to think while at her dads house about what an entitled brat she is and not put any future roommates through the same type of bs. Even if she does though- not your circus, not your monkeys!", "Glad everything worked out for you! I remember reading your original post (and got downvoted to hell for my comment, which I still stand by), but it sounds like you really worked out a way to maturely (on your end, anyways) discuss this. I\u2019m so happy that you\u2019re not dealing with her or the boyfriend anymore!", "So glad things worked out for you! \ud83e\udd17", "If Layla wants to live in a fantasy world, she shouldn't have gotten an apartment in the real one.", "OK, so I'm gonna be the AH who points this out: Your BFF is moving in with you and it seems it is just your name on the lease. Which means that, legally, you are on the hook for ALL the rent every month. You trust your BFF to pay her half because you have known each other forever, right? But, sh\\*t happens and friendships can be strained when $ enters the equation. I strongly recommend you get Allie on the lease ASAP so that she has to pay her rent to the landlord and not to you. It may prevent big problems in the future.", ">\tand I can get a cat! \n\nThis is the best part of your update, congrats!", "Right, it\u2019s the audacity for me.", "That's the part that really stood out to me!!", "Thank you.
