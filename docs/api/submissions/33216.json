No one is telling me these two are bad people for getting caught in the heat of the moment. They absolutely should\u2019ve stripped the bed, no question.

Either that, or understand that intimate humans , in privacy, will do intimate things. You can\u2019t regulate their sex life just because they\u2019re in your house. That\u2019s more like parenting, and as other said, will entice them to say screw that even more (not saying that was their thought process, we cannot assume.)\n\nEither way, ultimately, the best thing would be to express your concern WHY you want no sex in your house. If it\u2019s a power move for you, hosting days with guest that feel comfortable staying over should be slim to non existent. On the contrary, if it\u2019s simply about bedding, write a fun thoughtful note saying \u201cIf you guys make any spills or decide to get \u201cintimate\u201d all I ask is that you fold up the bedding neatly so it\u2019ll be ready for a wash.\u201d They\u2019d likely think it was thoughtful and an adult practice. It states the reasoning of your needs, and not focusing on controlling their lives. I would also hope most adults know not to be too vocal but this is about a bedding issue.", "It seems the consensus is that AITA as a subreddit is mainly teens and 20-somethings, and if that's the case I'm sitting here in my late 30's wondering how the hell the generations after me got more prudish and sex-negative.
