No one is telling me these two are bad people for getting caught in the heat of the moment. They absolutely should\u2019ve stripped the bed, no question.

Either that, or understand that intimate humans , in privacy, will do intimate things. You can\u2019t regulate their sex life just because they\u2019re in your house. That\u2019s more like parenting, and as other said, will entice them to say screw that even more (not saying that was their thought process, we cannot assume.)\n\nEither way, ultimately, the best thing would be to express your concern WHY you want no sex in your house. If it\u2019s a power move for you, hosting days with guest that feel comfortable staying over should be slim to non existent. On the contrary, if it\u2019s simply about bedding, write a fun thoughtful note saying \u201cIf you guys make any spills or decide to get \u201cintimate\u201d all I ask is that you fold up the bedding neatly so it\u2019ll be ready for a wash.\u201d They\u2019d likely think it was thoughtful and an adult practice. It states the reasoning of your needs, and not focusing on controlling their lives. I would also hope most adults know not to be too vocal but this is about a bedding issue.", "It seems the consensus is that AITA as a subreddit is mainly teens and 20-somethings, and if that's the case I'm sitting here in my late 30's wondering how the hell the generations after me got more prudish and sex-negative.

Regardless of sex, I would assume you were going to wash the sheets afterward anyway. What, you were just going to remake the bed after two guests slept in it and just let the next guest come over and sleep in it again? You may have never said you weren't going to replace the sheets, but you never said you were either. I don't get the problem. If you were always going to wash the sheets, then what's the big deal?\n\nSecond, you act as if you're surprised they had sex after sleeping in the same bed. You were at a holiday party with them all night long. You had NO indication they were interested in each other in that way? And when they announced they were going to sleep in the same bed - instead of one in the bed and one on the couch, say - what did you think was going to happen? Hell, you even wrote a note \"jokingly\" saying, \"No sex!\" and put it on the bed. You knew what was up. Either you make one sleep on the couch or accept they were going to have sex. \n\nLastly, it's just sex. The bed was \"soaked\" in \"various\" liquids??? And \"confirm the origin\"???? WT absolute F? Did they have sex or an orgy with Caligula?\n\nYour two \"very close friends\" had sex in your house. BFD. Tell them \"congrats, I'm glad you enjoyed the party,\" wash the sheets like you were going to, and move on.", "ESH\n\nThey should have cleaned their own bedding\n\nWhy shame them about the sex? It's not like you would have left it if it were some other kind of stain. Dry clean them and send the new couple the bill", "Back in the day, I got shitfaced and slept in a friend's spare room. I pissed the bed, lol. I stripped off the sheets, let them know the next morning, and gave them money for damages. Anyways, as an adult, that always sticks in my head after having friends crash in my spare room for any reason. Once they leave, I don't even question it. It could be piss, sex juices, or even a little drool on the pillow case. Bedding comes off and is washed.", "What a weird story.", "YTA for asking if they had sex. Why not assume they did and wash the bedsheets accordingly? You are going to lose friends if phoning them to ask.", "YTA.  They didnt even tell me i needed to change the sheets!

It sounds exhausting.", "YTA", "INFO, was there really substances splashed and soaked all over, or was it just a few spots from some quick after party fun?

We're all adults, however, my friends usually strip the bed before they leave.", "As someone with a friend who doesn't give a shit if ppl are around or not when her and her bf get frisky I can personally say it's weird asf how the friend had sex in the guest bed only to not clean up. At least when my friend and her man get horny they actively clean up their own mess and let others know \"Hey we fucked but we cleaned so and so.\" Only time they don't clean up is if it involves sharing hotel rooms other wise they just make up the bed but won't strip it.", ">The substances needed to be cleaned regardless of their source,\n\nAs a result of the decision they made, not OP.\n\nThen those who made the mess, did not clean it up, but instead left that to OP.  They even denied making it at first.  Strong NTA, but I can't say the same of OP's \"friends.\"", "It's his house if he doesn't want people having sex in HIS house then they should abide by that but they didn't. Not a big deal to go one night without fucking. It makes it worse that the dude had to clean it too, like that's pretty gnarly.", "OP *jokingly* said no sex. Meaning they didn't actually care and just wanted to razz the friends knowing they likely would have sex.\n\nOP then shoulda just gotten on the friends for not rolling up the sheets before leaving. That's just straight up rude to not do for your host, let alone a very close friend. \n\nClean up after yourselves, people.", "Agreed. I\u2019m sex positive, I still don\u2019t want my friends banging in my house. It\u2019s weird and shows that they have zero respect for my property.

In fact, I would fully expect that they used the bed to have sex after a boogie night as I'd be doing the same with my partner, and denying them that would be ridiculous.\n\nThere seems to be a split down the middle but I never imagined this was a thing.", "No, you\u2019re not weird.  It\u2019s weird to care what consenting adults do in a bed they eve been invited to stay in, and it\u2019s weird to write notes to the guest on toilet paper.", "Fuck in my bed. But if you strip my sheets and shove them in the wrong hamper, wash them incorrectly or **leave them balled up on the fucking floor** and you will never set foot in my house again.\n\nIn my culture stripping the bed after using it is a sign you are being punished and not given hospitality or that the bed was uncomfortable or demeaning. It\u2019s more of a fuck you than some drunk sex.\n\nAlso if you have sex on the sheets and leave semen in quantity you need to wash the linens on cool or you set a protein stain at heat. I wash the duvet cover and fitted sheet differently. Unless asked do not start reorganising my dishwasher, cupboards or laundry. That is far more invasive to me than sex.\n\nPlus I do my laundry after I host to my time frame not the guest\u2019s.

Only reason I could gather is jealousy", "wrongen hahaha", "They should have stripped the sheets and gave op a heads up.", "OP made it clear they were not ok with them having sex in the bed and they did it anyway, that makes them the AH. If OP didn't say anything and then found the sheets, it'd be a different story.", "Being an adult now means being an animal? It's usually their teen years when people can't control themselves because they're not mature enough for some _one-day_ self restriction and basic respect for the owner of the house.", "They stained his sheets and bailed. They made it weird. They could have made it a point to replace the sheets or inform op so theycould buy gloves and stain treatment or new sheets.

That's the weirdest part to me, like just chill until you get to your own bed.", "I agree. It's really crazy.

What in the world.", "If someone had bad allergies and had left droodles of snot all over my bedding in the room and left them and didn\u2019t bother telling me I would be fuming if I then started cleaning up and found myself touching it.

I always have spare clean sheets on hand and make sure to change the sheets before anyone else stays in that room so it's never an issue either way.
