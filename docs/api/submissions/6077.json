She and her husband were going to her in-laws place and they don\u2019t like dogs. I was asked to take her dog and I has staying home for Christmas so I agreed. She bought her dog over and quickly left saying she had to go. The first night I heard her dog \u201ccoughing\u201d but thought it might be my heating system, it\u2019s kind of dry and I forgot to use my humidifier. \n\nThe next day her dog did not look good and won\u2019t eat his breakfast. I called her but couldn\u2019t connect with her so I bought her dog to the 24h emergency vet. The vet said it was probably canine distemper but they wanted to do tests to be sure and I was freaking out because my dogs could also be infected even though they do have the vaccine. \n\nI called my friend over 50 times over 2 hours before she responses. I told her about the distemper and she said \u201coh\u201d. I asked her if she knew about the symptoms and she just said he wasn\u2019t feeling well but she didn\u2019t think it was anything serious. I was pissed and demanded to know why she didn\u2019t mention it when she bought her dog over. She defended herself by saying he just had a bit of a cold and if I knew I wouldn\u2019t have taken him. I said no shit and hung up. She came back that night and went to visit her dog who was still at the vet. \n\nI also found out the reason she couldn\u2019t board her dog was because he doesn\u2019t have any of the vaccines mandated. I\u2019m so pissed I didn\u2019t think to ask her and at her for not disclosing that because obviously no kennel would take her dog without the vaccine papers. \n\nThe initial tests for her dog and later my dogs cost about $630 for which I sent her the bill. She argued with me her family can\u2019t afford it and that her dog needs even more vet visits she can\u2019t cover and I told her I didn\u2019t care she is responsible for her dogs bills and mine because I had to make sure they weren\u2019t infected. She cried and tried to get my sympathy but I don\u2019t have sympathy for her as soon as she didn\u2019t mention her dog\u2019s had not been feeling well and put mine in danger. Her dog is still sick and my friends said I should absorb the cost since I\u2019m wealthier with no children but I think they only feel sorry for her because she didn\u2019t try to infect their dogs.", "created_utc": 1672453466, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zziulz/aita_for_demanding_my_friend_pay_for_the_vet_bills/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That poor dog needs to be re-homed. She is not fit to be a dog owner.", "NTA  \n\nWhat an idiot.  \n\nNo vaccine.  Blows off symptoms of illness.   Pawns the dog off on you even thought she knows her dog is sick and not vaccinated AND that you have dogs that could be infected.  \nNow she won't pay for your dogs vet bill.    \n\nIrresponsible dog owners must give up their dogs if they refuse to have them vaccinated.   If you can't afford vaccinations you can't afford a dog.  \n\nAnd your friends are on *her* side because you have more money??!   That's not the fk'n point.   The point is is that she *knew* her dog was sick and put yours in danger.   I have zero sympathy for people like that.", "NTA \n\nIf someone was looking after my dog and needed to take it to the vet for one reason or another, I\u2019d assume I\u2019d be the one paying the bill. \n\nPretty straightforward really.", "NTA not your pet, not your responsibility. she clearly did not communicate with you properly and risked the health of your dogs. and now she wants you to pay for HER errors. fuck that. time to reconsider some relationships", "NTA she acted maliciously. She should have vaccinated her dog too. Saving money on vacines means spending more on vets. She didn\u2019t disclosed with you her dog\u2019s situation knowingly you wouldn\u2019t have taken it if you knew it\u2019s situation. She put you and your pets in danger. She should be glad you didn\u2019t sue her over it.", "NTA. She should pay having known there were issues and you didn't cause them.", "NTA. \n\nShe was all around incredibly irresponsible and negligent. Her dogs vet bills are not your problem, and if she can\u2019t afford to pay for treatment then she should have payed for the vaccine!", "NTA.  She dropped her dog off, knowing he was sick.  You tried multiple times to get ahold of her before taking the dog to the vet.  Clearly, the dog needed medical attention.  She is responsible for the vet bills.  However, I have a feeling she won't be paying, and you either will need to take her to small claims court, or let it go.", "NTA. The dog needs to be removed from her home, and I would file in small claims court out of straight up spite for not properly caring for her dog and endangering mine.", "Absolutely NTA, the nerve of this fucking \u201cfriend\u201d to potentially infect your dogs,  or get her own dog vaccinated, notice the dog is sick and say/do nothing, then cry to you for sympathy when it bites her in the ass. You need a new friend and you need to report her to animal services of some kind for animal neglect cause this is awful.", "Absolutely NTA. Don't get a pet if you can't afford the vet bills. It's not like something you did caused the dog to get sick so it's not your responsibility.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like she deliberately deceived you by not telling you her dog was sick when, in fact,she thought her dog had a cold. Doesn\u2019t sound like much of a friend. She also didn\u2019t tell you that her dog was completely unvaccinated which makes the fact that she thought her dog was sick even worse. If I asked someone to watch my dog that was feeling unwell that is the first thing I would tell them. \n\nI would absorb the cost and distance myself from this friend. She obviously cared more about her travel plans than the well being of your dog. If I were her I wouldve at least offered to pay you back slowly since she is not doing well financially.", " \n\nNTA. Dogs don\u2019t really get colds. Bordatella and distemper, but not colds. Any coughing should be evaluated by a vet. Plus she didn\u2019t have the $20 vaccines that would have prevented these illnesses in the first place.", "NTA. Absolutely do not pay for her. She knew this would happen. She knew the dog was sick. These are the consequences of her actions. She must pay and be cut off.", "NTA. But I think you will need to take her to small claims court to collect your money.", "NTA but she is not a friend.\n\n\"my friends said I should absorb the cost since I\u2019m wealthier with no children\"\n\nand neither are they.", "NTA, People like that shouldn't have animals. She definitely needs to be paying for that, and as far as the excuse \"since you're wealthier with no kids\" , wtf life choices. I wouldn't trust her with any thing ever. Good luck, this looks ugly, sorry you have to deal with that.", "Distemper? And no vaccines? Means the dog isn\u2019t protected against parvo either. NTA of course. That\u2019s despicable behavior.\n\nFor anyone who doesn\u2019t know, if you have someone watching your pets while you\u2019re away, leave a permission-to-treat form with your vet. You can specify how much care can be given if they can\u2019t contact you, and it makes it much easier to get care for your pet if something comes up.", "NTA. Don\u2019t own a pet if you can\u2019t afford to take care of them.", "NTA. Sucks she doesn\u2019t sound like she thinks she needs to spend money on her dog\u2019s health. A lot of people are like that. Lesson: before taking responsibility for anyone\u2019s pet, ask all the questions about what to do if they get sick, what their budget is for emergency vet, etc., and if you don\u2019t agree with their answers don\u2019t watch the pet", "NTA. What she did was totally unacceptable and at the very least she should cover her dogs vet bills. If people can\u2019t afford vet care they should not have pets. Dogs don\u2019t normally get \u201ccolds\u201d (which any decent dog owner knows) so her ignoring the dogs symptoms and then just bringing it to your home to expose to your pets- ARGH! This is a bad person.", "NTA. She knew her dog wasn\u2019t feeling well, didn\u2019t tell you, and exposed your dogs to whatever her dog had. She is 100% responsible for all the vet bills. Your status (financially and with no children) has no bearing on whether she should pay or not. If your friends feel bad for her, they can all pay you for it.", "NTA   It's not like she dropped off a healthy dog that suddenly got sick. Not vaccinating her pet is inexcusable. She should pay.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

She put your pets at risk out of pure irresponsible and ignorant laziness. She should not be allowed to have pets.", "NTA.\n\nA dog is a responsibility, not a toy. She\u2019s an incredibly irresponsible dog owner AND she manipulated you into watching her dog by withholding the fact that he was ill.\n\nShe should pay the bills AND be made to get the dog\u2019s vaccines up to date.

Her dog is her responsibility and if she had been a responsible pet owner, the bill might've been lower.\n\nYour friends need to stay out of it. It doesn't matter if you are wealthier and have no kids.", "NTA. Wealth has nothing to do with it. Your friend is a callous brain dead individual who is not responsible enough to own a dog. \nAsking you to pay the bills is ridiculous. She needs to own up and pay for the shit she has put her dog through", "NTA. Tell her to start a payment plan immediately or you're taking her to small claims court.", "NTA. I\u2019m thinking she knew there was something really wrong and didn\u2019t have the money to bring it to a vet. Your friendship will probably be over after this. Take her to small claims court.", "NTA\nAs a vet who deals with assholes a lot- this is a good time to make an *anonymous* complaint to animal controls about the sick dog and lack of care- there are laws requiring rabies vaccines at minimum, often others depending on the town and I\u2019m 100% sure that if the dog doesn\u2019t even have basic vaccines it\u2019s also not licensed where it lives.  Time for a paper trail even if they don\u2019t end up doing anything - she needs to take this seriously. The dog deserves better", "NTA, quite frankly if I were you I would rehome this dog myself, she's an abusive dog owner and had admitted she does not have the money to care for it.", "NTA she needs to surrender the dog if she can't afford it", "NTA.  Get documents from the vet about her neglect and report her.  You don't need to be friends with some as cruel as she is.  All the towns in my area have low,/no cost vaccines if you need them. There's no excuse for not caring for your animals.", "NTA- take her to small claims soon if she doesn\u2019t pay up.", "YTA for being friends with a low life. Other than that, NTA", "NTA", "Exactly. Anytime I leave my dog with someone I also include \u201ctheir\u201d credit card in case the dog gets sick or injured while I\u2019m away. That way no one has to worry about how to pay or who is responsible. I\u2019d rather have an unnecessary extra payment or two to pay it off than a dead or dying dog because someone already doing me a favor would be stuck paying a vet bill.", "Dogs don't just 'get colds' like people anyway. Stomach issues from eating something dumb are the only mild, not vet worthy illnesses I can think of Even so, you wouldn't (shouldn't) drop your sick dog off without mentioning it.", "Agree on NTA and I don't think poor OP is going to see a dime unless they take her to court. I'm confused by the other friends siding with the neglectful dog owner. That dog needs to be vaccinated and have proper care, neither of which the friend is doing. If this was in my city the dog could be removed for being unlicensed (dog can't be licensed without shots) and the friend would have to pay a fine and get the shots for the dog to reclaim them.", "Call your city pet licensing department. Most places an animal must have vaccinations to be licensed.", "Yep. The last time I left my guinea pigs with family when I was out of state, I also left a credit card, their vet's phone number, and the contact info for the nearest exotics vet to their house in case something happened and they couldn't make the hour-long drive to our usual one. And that was my own parents, not a friend. Who tf expects someone else to cover their pet's expenses like that??", "Yep. I always leave detailed instructions for each cat, the name and number of their vet, and the name, number, and address of the emergency vet. I make sure anyone caring for our animals knows where the carriers are and that they have access to one of our credit cards, just in case. If, for some reason, someone paid out of their pocket for anything our animals needed, the LEAST we could do would be to reimburse them.", "I agree that OP is NTA- but as for the shots, it depends on where they live. I\u2019m in CT in the US and the only vaccine required by law is rabies so that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed to license the dogs. Again I obviously agree that the friend is the asshole for not treating their pet and for not informing OP, but we also don\u2019t know if the dog has NEVER been vaccinated, if he\u2019s a bit overdue, how often he\u2019s around other dogs, etc. OP just says he couldn\u2019t be boarded because he didn\u2019t have the shots- it\u2019s possible that this was a last minute trip, the vet couldn\u2019t squeeze the dog in for an appointment, and he\u2019s only overdue for his vaccines by a few weeks. \n\nThe friend is definitely the AH for not disclosing that the dog was Ill, for endangering OP\u2019s dogs, and for then refusing to pay the bill, but we don\u2019t know the whole story behind her dogs vaccine status. \n\nThat said- people need to vaccinate their dogs damnit.", "Are guinea pigs considered exotic?", "They are! It's a pain in the ass to find a vet who will treat them, especially in less densely populated areas. I've been lucky\u2013 I had one about half an hour away, and then when she retired, found another good one slightly closer. (Which is helpful since one of my furry little jerks has needed to go several times lately, but I digress.)\n\nEdit: They're exotic from a veterinary perspective. In my state, they're not exotic in the sense that you need a special permit \u2013 though oddly enough, dwarf hamsters are."]}
