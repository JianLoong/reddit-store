You probably should have just said you might get something on your own if you found it, but overall I think you dodged a bullet here.", "NTA your sister and her partner are being weird. I would just let her simmer until she reaches out though. Sounds like she needs to get over it on her end", "NTA for not renting a house without your sister, but a little bit TA because you waited until you signed a lease before telling her you werent interested in renting with her.", "\"My sister asked me which of the other two child sized bedrooms my partner and I wanted. \"\n\nSo they would be primary leasers and you were just there to help pay the rent and watch the kids. No. Just. No.", "NTA. You know living with her would've been a nightmare. She tried to make you sign early, and to a place that would be great for her and her husband, but not so much for you.\n\nSome people just thrive on drama. Is she one of those?", "NTA. You're not obliged to do anything until everything is set in stone. That house your sister was looking at clearly wasn't going to work for you guys, so I think it's reasonable to back out. Unless you told them \"yes I'm going to go with this house for sure 100%\", definitely NTA", "She wanted your help with the mortgage and free child care.  YTA though - you should have been clear and upfront when you started getting the bad vibes.", "ESH\n\nWhy didn't you just tell her before you applied or got the lease, you were still trading listings at this point.\n\nAlso you say in the end, oh it would not have worked out if we lived with each other, but in the beginning you thought it would be great.\n\nYou both are acting like children", "NTA\n\nHowever, it may have been wise to be upfront with her. You are free to live with who you want but it is a slight AH move to just leave them hanging. Again however, I don't think this action constitutes a E S h verdict.", "Esh your sis for pushing for a place that didn't work for everyone involved.  You for not telling them you were continuing to look for just yourselves.", "YTA,\n\nI get you\u2019re reasons. Completely valid. But you first talked about renting together, got bad vibes, but instead of communicating like adults you just got another place to stay leaving them out and dry. Sorry, even if you had valid reasons, you handled the situation immaturely and that makes you an ahole", "YTA.  You strung them along.  \"....and were just looking at this place for an idea.\"  Did you tell them that, no.  \"I was still looking at houses and sending them back and forth with my sister.\"  Leading them on more.  Of course they are mad.  So they are just supposed to forget that you wanted to rent with them, strung them along, and then rented some place and told them after you secured housing instead of telling them before you would not move in with them and were looking at other options.  Them buying a house doesn't magically excuse your poor behavior.", "Did you *tell* your sister that you had started looking for places just for your partner and yourself?\n\nIt seems like YTA, because you let your sister assume that you were still looking for places for all of you, but in reality you applied for a place just for your partner and yourself.", "YTA. You agreed to live with her, should have told her you were looking for places for you and your partner.", "NTA.

I know I should have but I was afraid she would try and change my mind. I'm a people pleaser.", "Why decide to rent with her if you already had a bad experience in the past? Why not set rules on each family\u2019s expectations? I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re an AH but it really like a poor decision from the start.\nYou owe your sister an apology for the way you managed the issue", "So you are blaming her for your issues and were only open to using them to rent a place if you could not find something else.

You led your sister to believe you were renting a house with her and abruptly rented a place just for you and your partner.

From her POV, you changed the plan entirely out of nowhere."]}
