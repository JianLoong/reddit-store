He can move for his career; you can stay for yours. If he's worth it, he'll put in the work to make the relationship function long-distance.

Just sayin.", "Nta - don't give up your career. Speaking as someone who had just come out from doing this. It's not worth it.

You're each committed to your careers more right now, and that's ok.  \n\n\n I'm not trying to sound old fashioned here, but I'm surprised he expects you to follow him to another city and you're not married.
