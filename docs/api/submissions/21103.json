I work in the restaurant industry, as does my husband (fine dining, specifically), so I understand how big of an achievement getting a chef job is. Especially at only 22 years old! That's an INCREDIBLE accomplishment!!\n\nHere's my advice / opinion. \n\nHe can move away for his career and y'all could try long distance. Once you've built up more \"clout\" and experience as a chef, you could probably get a job at a restaurant in the city your bf is moving to. In my experience (and the experiences of my colleagues), once you land a job in a good restaurant / kitchen, it's fairly easy to relocate to a different city and get a job at a different restaurant. This probably doesn't ring true for every single person in this industry, but it's something to think about. Especially if the people you work for have connections with other chefs - a recommendation from a talented / well-known chef can take you a long way.\n\nLong distance is hard and not everyone is willing to have a LDR in the first place. If this applies to you and your partner, this may, unfortunately, be a relationship-ending circumstance.   \n\nNeither of you should give up these job opportunities. Each of your careers are equally important. Especially since these jobs are opportunities that apply to the careers y'all want to stick with for a long time (if not permanently). If you don't want to go long distance and you can't come up with some other kind of compromise, I highly recommend focusing on yourself and your career and break up on good terms.   \n\nI'm not sure how long you've been together or how serious your relationship is, but 22 is **so young!** You are far too young to halt your career path because of a relationship.   \nNot to mention, he is 13 years your senior. It's not impossible for people with big age gaps to have a successful relationship, but I'd like to be brutally honest here.   \n\nA 22 year old dating anyone over 30 rarely ends well. Those relationships are not often built on good intentions. This may not be your situation, but with the way he is treating this issue (acting like his career is more important than yours), he might value a lot of, if not all of, his decisions over yours. With this age gap and your young age in mind, if you decide to follow him and give up your dream, you could very easily end up on that path for the rest of your life (or the rest of your relationship, I'm not saying if you follow him you will automatically be together forever).    \n\nI am a big advocate of **not** blaming or chastising young women who fall into unhealthy relationships with older men, but I'm an even bigger advocate of those young women understanding what the age gap could mean.   \n\nOne of my very best friends was in a relationship almost identical to yours as far as age is concerned. Her boyfriend treated her like a child and talked down to her *all the time.* She knew he was doing it, but was too caught up in being in love with him to truly realize how much this was controlling her. Now that they are apart and she has had relationships with people closer to her age, she sees how uneven the playing field was in her relationship with the older guy.    \n\nI don't want to judge you or shit on your relationship, so I'm truly sorry if what I'm saying hurts you in any way, but I really hope you can look at this predicament you're in and decide if this relationship is really worth it. I'm sorry to say, but I can almost guarantee it is not. \n\nI want to emphasize again how young you are and how much opportunity you have. You are only 22 and you landed your dream job!! If you continue to enjoy this career, you can go SO FAR having started as a chef so young. \n\nMaybe y'all can come up with a compromise, but you've mentioned that there is already resentment and tension surrounding your relationship. This is a tough decision for any couple - couples closer in age, couples who have been together for many years, or any other circumstance. But I **strongly** advise you to end this relationship and focus on your career. Breakups are hard and sad and can be traumatic. But, as with almost any tough situation, you will feel less pain over time. \n\nI really do wish you well, OP. Congratulations on snagging your dream job. Please put your needs ahead of his.

You overgeneralize all age-gaps as romantically unsuccessful men preying on younger women, and anyone who wishes to nuance such a broad statement by more generally discussing the potential benefits and pitfalls of age-gaps is immediately condemned as self-serving. \n\nSure, men such as Tittoilet describes exist, but treating an age-gap as a red flag in and of itself sounds rather shortsighted and predisposed. If everyone involved is aware and in agreement with the areas that require additional attention within a relationship with an age-gap, I don\u2019t see why the age-gap itself would evoke such a harsh response.\n\nAnd before you go off: I am indeed in a relationship with an age-gap, but one where she is 12 years older. We\u2019ve been together since I was 30, so for almost 9 years now. And the age-gap related reasons for attraction are still very much at play, for both of us.", "Because they\u2019re easier to control and manipulate.", "Ew.", "Men that make the \u201cexecutive decision\u201d that the couple needs to move and tried to stifle the women\u2019s needs.

Unless she's working closely with executive chefs at the Gordon Ramsay/Guy Fieri/Jamie Oliver level, she won't be able to even network herself out of her locality, which means she literally will have to start completely from scratch there with nobody to vouch for her. Whereas he has his company links there and is simply transferring offices. This is a MAJOR concern, especially if OP is JUST starting her career - things will never be equitable in this relationship.", "This!", "Indeed!", "He landed a high paying job in another city.

She deserves this.\n\nFrom my own lived experience and that of many other women, I've found that it's essential for a woman to prioritize her education and career. She is often paid less than a man, so she must have a strong resume. She is often left \"holding the baby\" should she decide to become a mother. She needs to be able to support a family. She needs to save for her retirement. It just makes sense for her to pay attention to her success.\n\nThere are some significant differences between OP and BF: the age gap, stages of life, and incompatible work schedules. (Chefs work early and late, not so much 9 to 5.) I don't see any accommodation happening here. For example, had BF discussed his new out-of-town job opportunity and its consequences with OP before accepting the offer?\n\nPerhaps OP and BF can transition to a remote relationship so they can each take advantage of their job offers while negotiating to accommodate their differences. A little distance and time to think can be helpful in a conflict.", "Exactly - until those younger people try to make their own decisions that their older partner doesn't agree with and then the controlling tamper tantrums and pressure starts.", "No, it's cause they're hotter and won't have a geriatric pregnancy.

My ex was 20 when I started dating her, I was 23.

Idk how relatable the experiences and life of a 22 year old is to someone who is 35. I can be friends with someone given this age gap and common interests, but dating someone who's presumably fresh out of school while in my mid 30's? dude has more in common with her parents.", "As an ageless vampire, I completely agree", "35 and 22 is, first of all, inherently ripe for abuse. Second he said his aspirations always take priority, that\u2019s abusive. She\u2019s 22 and starting her career, she\u2019s not in the place to settle down and have kids. If that\u2019s what he wants he should be aiming at the 30-35 year old crowd, not the girl who went to prom a couple years ago.", "She\u2019s asking if she\u2019s being selfish because his grooming and manipulation is having the desired effect to some degree.", "No because he directly said his wants should be prioritized over hers. He\u2019s not in love. She\u2019s an accessory to him.", "No she said she is a chef and she landed her dream job. That doesn't mean any chef job is a replacement.

I imagine your ex at 20 was also not relatable to another person that was 20 and had kids at 18 and started working. Just like you would he in same situation with a 23 year old that was doing their masters and also had just been in school the whole time. I also gotta say a 20 year old with a curfew is super weird haha.\n\n  \n\n\nAfter 22 when you just start working, life is pretty similar no matter the age.

I'd agree that dating a 22 year old is not something *I'd* personally do (I'm in my mid-30s, as well), but I don't agree it's inherently ripe for abuse to do so.

We know nothing of the boyfriend and the fact that men and women value two different things in their partners plays a pretty big role in successful relationships.  Women start adulthood in their primes and that starts tapering after 30 years old in the dating market.

This is deeply engrained regardless of age, color, or creed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWomen value a partner that can provide and protect, which is why you will find older women picking apart younger women who date men a decade or more older than themselves.  Most of the vitriol comes from women 35 and up because they wasted their primes with partners they should not have due to social pressures of \"age gap\" dating. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegardless of our opinions on the yin and the yang of feminine and masculine desires and traits, if this is a really lucrative offer like OP is claiming her boyfriend is probably thinking family and career is not a top priority in a partner for someone who can provide for a family on a single income.

If it's more than 2 years, he was in his 30s dating a teenager, if it's less than 2 years, why would she uproot her entire life for him?
