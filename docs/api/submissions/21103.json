My husband is 14 years older than me.  He is an excellent husband and partner and always has been.  \n\nWe both have our own careers and aspirations and functional well as individuals and as a couple.", "Even if he wasn't, they are no longer compatible. It happens (although he sounds like an AH if he said his career was more important). Time to move on.", "lmfao what kind of rule is that, the age gap is still huge", "24.5 actually.", "As a woman 374 years older then the boyfriend, I also agree.", "Because we are **happier** that way.", "Or just relevant upbringing. \n\n22 year olds never knew the world existed before cell phones and smart phones.", "The fact that he is more than 50% older than me says nothing about why he can't be in a relationship with someone in his own age cohort.", "Yes. I mean I'm SURE it's been around forever (if someone shows you who they are . . . )\n\nBut I've heard it SIX times in the last week and a half between the show and the podcast", "I know right!?! Him wanting her to move means he loves her not because he is some misogynistic pig. Doesn\u2019t mean he is right but also doesn\u2019t make him a monster either. People here tend to forget that not everything is victim and villain.", "Yes, interesting timing coincidence, isn't it?", "Both are working as their primary responsibilities, no kids and not planning for them yet, probably prioritizing saving of their income. She may be more mature if he prioritizes having fun over saving but they seem to be in about the same places in life. If their financial and social goals are comparable they seen like they are in similar stages of life.", "You\u2019re making a pretty big assumption that OP has low or no self-esteem and doesn\u2019t have the mental capacity or agency to decide who she dates. That\u2019s pretty insulting to infantalize an adult.", "I'm glad your are in a happy and respectful relationship. Age doesn't determine how respectful someone is, I'm sorry you have they preconception.", "How old were you when you got together?", "Its not a rule per se, it appears that that is what is socially acceptable. It's called the half plus 7 rule.", "Can confirm as the boyfriend 374 years younger than the woman", "It's a Maya Angelou quote. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "> he dismissed them and insisted that I should prioritize his aspirations over mine.\n\nHe's a dick.", "Exactly. Life isn\u2019t as polarized as this sub would have you believe. Grey area exists, and not everything is like you said, victim and villain.\n\nI think people just project their insecurities here. Their relationship with an older man didn\u2019t work out when they were younger? All age gap relationships must be horrible and misogynistic! \n\nLife just doesn\u2019t work that way", "Lmfao sure he\u2019s not a monster. Just a wholesome guy telling a young girl she needs to isolate and move away from her support system, her career and her home because his career is more important. He needs to go alone, and grow up emotionally to the point he\u2019s not preying on barely legal.", "No I\u2019m making the judgement call that her bf is seeking someone like that, and it\u2019s correct if he had the audacity to say his accomplishments should always take priority over hers.", "In my experience no one actually thinks is socially acceptable, it\u2019s just what\u2019s used for cases like this where you can say \u201cJesus Christ, OP, you\u2019re even too young for this completely made up and arbitrary rule! Dump his ass!\u201d", "I did not know, and I appreciate your informing me even if your emoji was AH-ish. \n\nLike fuck I'm sorry I haven't read every book ever.", "\"Move away from your support and dream job because my dreams are more advanced and lucrative, and thus more important.\" \n\nDude's a dick and why people scream about age gaps.", "It's not a quote from one of her books. I would add an emoji but I wouldn't want you to have a meltdown.", "Gurl bye\nEdit to add: lol and I just curse a lot. No meltdown. No hard feelings. Peace & blessings."]}
