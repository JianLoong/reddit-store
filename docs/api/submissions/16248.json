You were right to warn your friend of the impending catastrophe coming his way.", "From reading some of the comments, I know I'm going to get downvoted to hell's basement. BUT I've been OP's friend. In a wilting relationship where BF thought the solution was to propose. He approached my BFF for help choosing the ring. She stalled him and gave me the heads up. If OP's friend has been venting to OP about their dissatisfaction in the relationship, then allowing them to dodge an embarrassing public proposal and possibly painful retraction later is a solid friend move. \nAssuming you guys are tight, I'm going to say NTA.", "NTA good on you for exposing a coercive proposal.", "NTA. You said your friend\u2019s partner was *thinking* of proposing; you didn\u2019t say \u201c[x] is planning on proposing on the cruise\u201d. That\u2026 shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to your friend (surprise proposals shouldn\u2019t come 100% out of the blue l, ya know?), and public proposals\u2026 well I have some strong thoughts on them but to be diplomatic I think they are not a good idea unless you know your partner is okay with them and you\u2019ve already seriously discussed marriage. \n\nIt\u2019s a shitty situation, but judging by your friend\u2019s reaction, I don\u2019t think it was a bad move. Maybe not a great one, but imo definitely not an asshole one.", "Overall NTA, small esh, \n\nThese YTA comments are only focusing on the \"You broke his trust in telling you!!!\".\n\nYeah and he broke ops trust in not treating ops longer term friend right in their relationship.\n\nGood on you for helping your friend, public proposals during relationship issues are one of the biggest ways to manipulate the other person in saying yes. And then getting pissed when they back out in private and blasting them.\n\nI promise you by \"planned proposal\" he meant he was going to have like 3 people record it and instantly post it after he would be forced to say yes to avoid a bad public situation, so he would be forced to experience backlash from EVERYONE after backing out.\n\n\nNOTE TO EVERYONE SAYING: Fuck you if you do a surprise public proposal in front of strangers lol. I'd BEG for my friends to tell me ahead of time if I was getting a public proposal so I can go straight to my partner and tell them \"If you do a public proposal it's an instant no and I'm not even giving you a reaction, I'm just going to walk away.\"\n\nIf you're doing a surprise proposal, do it privately, if you do a public proposal ONLY DO THAT IF YOUR PARTNER EXPLICITLY STATES THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT ONE DAY!!

There comes a time when you have to let things be or step in. Yr friend would have been on a boat with no where to escape, trapped and in public pressured to say yes.

You gave him the heads up and allowed him to avoid the unfair pressure of a public proposal.\n\nYTA because you claim his partner is also a friend just one you've know for less time. A bit of an asshole move there since he did trust you.\n\nThe better thing to do would've been discouraging the public proposal and maybe just have said that this should be private. Only if he doubled down should you have taken it to the other friend.", "Yes. YTA. Meddling in people's business, oftentimes isn't seen as helpful. Boundaries need to be maintained.", "YTA. You purposefully sought to ruin a surprise. \n\nYou're likely correct, it would have ended badly.

Apologize to both parties profusely and hopefully you can preserve your relationships", "YTA. They may have had pre-existing problems and you caused bigger problems for spoiling the surprise which could lead to bigger problems", "YTA. It was not your place to tell. If you had concerns, you should have discussed them with the person who wanted to propose, rather than the one who was to be surprised.", "YTA. You violated the partner's trust.", "Nothing more irritating than an OP who argues with every judgement. You are unwilling to accept any YTAs, so are here for affirmation only not judgement. And YTA.", "YTA. Someone confided in you, and you betrayed his trust.", "YTA - And you know exactly why. Never betray the confidence of others. Integrity can only be given away\u2026you gave it away", "YTA\n\nWhy would you ruin someone's proposal. Even if they had pre-existing relationship issues, do you know he could've said no?", "It wasn\u2019t your place to tell. You can give advice and be a good friend but it\u2019s not your place to ruin a proposal.", "[deleted]", "YTA. You over stepped your boundaries and broke trust. You also ruined a moment for your friend that he can never get back.", "Yes, you are a genuine c#nt! Surprised you're even asking.", "YTA- it was not your place to say something so huge like that and spoil it. I get that you were trying to be helpful but you could have done it another way like suggesting to your friend that he talk to his partner about the problems if he hasn't already. Anything that was more subtle than spoiling a big event and possibly causing more issues on top of that. Ultimately it's their relationship and you should not have said anything because they should have been given the chance to work it out by themselves in their own way. How would you feel if someone spoiled something like that for you?", "YTA. You should feel bad. You ruined a very special moment.", "YTA. Not your responsibility to prevent this from happening. You could have asked questions of the person going to propose- have they really thought about this, do they know how their partner feels about in-public proposals? Etc. and you could have suggested to your friend things like- have you guys spoken about marriage recently? Leading questions so they come to it themselves.", "YTA. It's like you said - they would have argued whether you said something or not. So don't say anything. When someone tells you  about a surprise they have planned for their partner, you keep that in confidence. \n\nYou also indirectly told your friend's partner \"hey, he's been complaining about your relationship so much that I decided to interfere in your proposal.\" So you betrayed both of their confidences. \n\nSometimes, you just have to let people make mistakes.", "Sorry, YTA.  You should not have betrayed the friend who confided his intentions to you.  You definitely interfered where you shouldn't have.", "YTA lol", "YTA. You betrayed a friend\u2019s trust and stuck your nose in where it didn\u2019t belong", "YTA. What would have been the worst thing if he proposed? Your friend said no and they break up? Sounds like that is going to happen anyways. You meddled when you shouldn\u2019t have.

No wonder he's furious. \n\nYou're a hero to your friend.", "Here\u2019s where you erred. You shouldn\u2019t have revealed the secret - because now the fight is about a secret you told. Instead of the very real\nissue that they aren\u2019t communicating well and one partner is grossly unhappy. And it would have been the same if you had been the \u201cmessenger\u201d to tell the proposer all the reasons bf felt neglected. Those are confidences. Things you have observed are not. \n\nI would have selected whichever partner I want to keep as a friend - in case it went sideways - or even both - and gently mentioned \u201cyou should talk to so and so because I think you may be on different pages with your relationship.\u201d These are just facts that you have gleaned through recent conversations and you are encouraging to communicate without being blindsided by too much info.", "I have spoken.", "My then-boyfriend, now husband and I both agreed that public proposals are bullshit and can be embarrassing for the person being proposed to. So when it came time for him to do it, he did it in a private place. We were driving around the mountains and stopping every now and then to take photos at vista points. He finally found one that didn\u2019t have a bunch of people clustered, pretended to root around his backpack looking for his camera (and conveniently got in a kneeling pose) but instead grabbed the ring box \ud83d\ude0a", "No they wouldn't have. Your friend would have said 'hey i feel like something is off with us are you happy in the relationship' and partner would have been like 'I'm very happy, just you wait' or whatever.", "So because one of them is grateful, what you did wasn't intrusive? I can't see that as being the reality. One person really resents you for doing that and that means you trespassed against one of them?", "Yes. That is exactly what should have happened. You allow two adults to sort their stuff out without your interference.\n\nYou say it like its a bad thing. Both of them need a huge kick in the pants about communicating better before they go on vacations. If they break up, they will be better individuals for their next relationships.\n\nBreakups aren't a bad thing if the people come out better for the next time.", "So why not tell your friend to discuss this with his boyfriend? Seems a lot more sensible than this \ud83d\ude0a", "Even if he would\u2019ve said no it wasn\u2019t your place to tell him. Did it come to your mind that his bf wanted to fix their relationship, even if the proposal didn\u2019t work they could\u2019ve come up with a plan and you broke this guys trust and not only will it impact their relationship but it will impact ur relationship with them", "Well I would definitely include this in the post. Public proposals are kind of awful, especially if you know you're relationship is in a not so great spot and you're thinking this will fix stuff. Either way... I still don't think it's right that you spoiled it but what's done is done. Some people like the public proposals but it is definitely important to talk about these things beforehand but also it's not your job to facilitate their relationship so either way, that sounds like a sticky situation but I feel like you probably should have tried to go about it another way but I suppose that's easier said than done. Alsp I saw in another comment your friend was grateful so I guess that's what matters. Your friend is happy with how you handled it but the boyfriend would say you're an asshole lol what matters is if you feel okay with your decisions at the end of the day as long as they didn't hurt someone.", "Still not your business", "Did your friend ever tell you that they would say no if they were proposed to?", "Exactly. I think my friend is right and that the proposal was a bandaid solution to their problems", "Even the idea of it horrifies me.

That would be a terrible place to be proposed to, especially when already iffy on the partnership.", "Yes I\u2019m baffled by it", "My heart", "How does this make sense?", "I get that and although I don\u2019t want to pick my sides because I\u2019ve only been getting my friend\u2019s one sided version of events, the things he\u2019s been telling me about their relationship are concerning.\n\nAnd I do agree with him that both the cruise holiday and proposal seemed like a bandaid solution.\n\nInstead of proposing he should have fixed their issues first. \n\nWhat 100% would have happened. He proposes on a cruise ship, friend says no, they argue and are both stuck hating each other on a cruise.", "I\u2019d rather not be stuck with a potential ex on a cruise.", "I have and he said he has and that his partner refused couples counseling", "No because my friend was grateful I told him", "This ain\u2019t it. If the proposal was going to be a private thing then you\u2019d have a point, but this guy planned a public proposal in circumstances where OP\u2019s friend would not have been able to comfortably say no without public embarrassment (which leads to tonnes of later retractions after initial yeses) where they would have to continue sharing a tiny space on a boat in the middle of the ocean for days after. It\u2019s coercive. Doing this does not fix a relationship, it further imperils it because it puts a potentially unwilling partner in a circumstance where they are effectively trapped.\n\nOP definitely made a choice of one friend over the other, of course, but if she\u2019s closer to that friend then she saved them a ruined holiday.", "I\u2019ve updated my post", "So you should stand by and let both of them suffer? It would\u2019ve been an awful experience for both of them.", "That's not a bandaid, that's a handcuff. Not only would your friend feel pressured to say yes because audience, they would also have to share a cabin the rest of the trip. That's a pretty high-pressure sales tactic.", "If I had a friend that talked to me about their rocky relationship and then their SO came to me and said they were going to propose on a cruise (or any situation where my friend would be trapped with the SO after answering), I would have told the SO that that's a terrifying way to go about proposing. If they insisted that's how they were doing it, I wouldn't think twice about warning my friend.", "Wait, what were they arguing about?", "A true friend wouldn't have spilled the secret. No matter how you cut it; you screwed over at least one friend. \n\nIt almost sounds like you wanted to witness the drama and be there for the after care.", "oh my gosh yes, public pressure to accept is bad enough, but then being trapped afterwards--even worse.", "So basically my friend after I told him was angry and said he felt like the proposal and the cruise was a bandaid solution to bigger problems they\u2019re having. So their argument was about their pre-existing issues and the proposal feeling like a cop out.", "So if they were going to fight anyway, why did you tell your friend?\n\nIt wasn't your secret to share it is sounds like you just wanted to insert yourself more into the drama.\n\nIf someone tells you something in confidence, you keep the confidence unless serious harm that can't be avoided in any other way.", "Oh ok...I thought the partner was being weird bc they were arranging the proposal and bf interpreted that as him pulling away. I see now.", "Because the argument would have happened with them stuck in a cruise ship.", "Yeah, that doesn't cut it as an excuse to betray a confidence.", "Would you like to be publicly proposed to inside a cruise ship, and not wanting to say yes but knowing that if you didn't the entire trip would be horrible, and you would be sharing a room inside a ship with the person who you just declined the proposal?\n\nThis proposal would be coersive. He would either say yes because he felt peer pressured, or he would say no, and everyone on the ship would know. And then they would have to share a cabin anyway.", "YTA, this is not at all something that you should have involved yourself in! This is all about you thinking you know what he wants and made you think that you as an outside friend knew more about their intimate relationship than his partner! If you were so concerned you express that to the proposing party and then stay TF out of it!", "YTA but a soft YTA because you intention was good but you still f up.\n\nSince they are both your friends when he told you he was going to propose you should've told him that his partner disclosed to you the relationship problems and caution him that you think its not a good idea and to sort that stuff out first. Not run to the other partner and told him about the proposal. That's where you went wrong.", "Nta. It\u2019s a really difficult situation that you were put in. It might not have been the perfect course of action but I believe you were trying to do the least harm. I\u2019d have been grateful to be told", "NTA. The idea and desire to get married should be agreed on by both partners long before a proposal is done. The proposal itself can totally be a surprise as long as it's within the boundaries of the person being proposed to (some love the idea of public, some hate it, etc). What this sounds like is the one who talked to you was bypassing the \"yes we both totally want to get married\" step and was gonna spring an *unwanted* proposal on them in a very manipulative way - public and in a space that can't easily be escaped.

Because I had no bad intentions", "And make sure you completely understand what the other person is saying. My brother's wife knew a proposal was pending, and asked him not to propose on Christmas. All he heard was blah, blah, blah, proposal, and blah, blah, blah Christmas. So he proceeds to propose on Christmas morning when they were unwrapping gifts with their respective children.
