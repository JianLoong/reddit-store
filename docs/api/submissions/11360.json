{"id": 11360, "submission_id": "11gx7hc", "title": "AITA for telling off a disabled woman who was taking advantage of my very elderly grandmother?", "selftext": "My Grandma Julia is going to be 84 years old this spring. Nonetheless, she is still a very robust and healthy woman - still very energetic and able bodied, despite her age.\n\nShe is kind, generous, and empathetic, almost to a fault. She was utterly devoted to caring for my late Grandpa until his death, and never, ever once complained. Towards the end, he felt badly about how much she had to care for him - and she flatly said, she never minded doing so in the slightest.\n\nAnyway. A few years ago, by her own choice, she sold the home her and Grandpa shared for decades, and moved into an apartment building for senior citizens.\n\nTo cut to the chase: a neighbour of hers who lives in the building, is in her fifties, and severely disabled due to a stroke she suffered a few years ago. That's a terrible situation to be in, and I do feel badly for her, however, I think she was taking advantage of my grandmother's kind heart.\n\nShe was getting my grandmother to help her with various things that, to be quite honest, I felt she REALLY just shouldn't be - i.e, helping her get onto the toilet, in and out of the shower, in and out of bed, etc.\n\nThose are things that, in my opinion, someone cannot be doing for another person, unless they're either family, or a licensed caregiver. For one? My Grandma may be in good health, but she is still a very old woman, and could seriously injure herself doing that. On top of that, there's a very serious liability issue here - if something happened to this woman, my Grandma could be held responsible for it, and I do NOT want that.\n\nWhen I went to visit with my infant son, and Grandma told me about this, I was less than pleased, and decided to march right down the hall and have a chat with her.\n\nI said, in these exact words: \"I know you have a serious disability and need help, but my Grandmother is a very elderly woman who simply cannot be doing things like that for you. She could seriously injure herself. If you need that much assistance with basic everyday tasks, you should really, really look into hiring a personal caregiver, or moving into an assisted living facility.\"\n\nThe woman retorted, \"My family is useless and won't help me. What are YOU going to do when YOU get old?\"\n\nI just said, \"I'll cross that bridge when I get to it, but the bottom line is, my Grandmother cannot help you anymore\". With that, I walked away.\n\nWhen I had a similar conversation with my Grandma, she agreed that helping this woman like that really wasn't a good idea. When she herself told this woman that she wouldn't help her anymore, the woman had a similarly unhappy response.\n\nAITA for telling that woman off the way I did?... Yes. She's severely disabled.

Your grandma should not be doing that kind of work, she could be injured or worse.  \n\nThe lady needs to look into social services to help her out. Somehow she managed before your grandma moved in, she can find a way to manage again.  From my understanding, apartments for seniors have people on staff to help with these kind of things.", "NTA\nYour grandma is very old and it might be danderous for her and the woman to help her move around the house, especially in the bathroom where everything is very slippery. This is also a bit inappropriate. Nonetheless, your grandmother deserves to get some rest and do the things that she enjoys, not to help this woman until the day she dies.", "NTA at all. \n\nYou spoke to the woman firmly, but politely, setting a healthy boundary; as did your grandmother, I'm sure. If the woman doesn't like it, it's only because she benefited from the lack of that boundary and that's not your problem. \n\nThe woman has options, like you pointed out. If she is that bad off, she could get an aid to help her. Or she could move into an assisted living/retirement home where she could get that type of care. \n\nAnd even if your grandmother wasn't elderly herself, she doesn't OWE this woman anything.

But that shouldn't make the tasks fall on your Gram. And good on you for speaking up!", "NTA.  You are protecting your Grandmother, who could be seriously injured doing these thing.  Her neighbor needs to be in an assisted living building, not on her own.", "NTA. Your grandma is old, she needs someone to help her and not be lifting another person. My mum did carer job in her 40s and she would come home in pain from lifting people up all the time, your grandma is double her age.\n\nAlso why did she ask you about when you're old?? Your grandma is old so by her definition, your grandma needs to get help and not be lifting other people.\n\nDon't think about you doing something wrong here, you are completely right and were respectful to her.", "NTA.\n\nYou're right that your grandmother could easily be hurt while trying to assist this woman. Good on you for standing up for your grandma.\n\nI agree that the woman either needs to hire a professional caregiver and/or move to an assisted living facility that can better accommodate her needs.", "NTA she can\u2019t use her disability as an excuse to\ntake an advantage of your elderly grandma that\u2019s really unfair and unnecessary. the disabled woman can get a worker to help.", "NTA this woman needs a professional carer.", "NTS\n\nIf something went wrong your gran could/would be held liable for it.", "NTA. I'm sorry for the woman and I hope she can find some way to arrange for a professional caregiver, but that's what she really needs. Your grandmother isn't one, and at her age she shouldn't be one even if she wanted to be -- even in good health, it could easily hurt her. Good on you for protecting her.", "NTA that is not OK to ask an elderly woman to help repeatedly with such heavy tasks, and she is not even family", "NTA. And you are so right. Your grandma could get hurt, the disabled lady could get hurt, and your grandma would get blamed. It is just a very bad situation all round. None of your selfless grandmas doing, so I hope she stays away. Surely the disabled lady has other options. In my country, you can get help for this kind of thing, absolutely free of charge. I realize everyone is not so lucky, but there has to be another way.", "NTA. \n\nI work in the legal field, focusing on work injuries. You\u2019d think most cases are from factories or construction sites. But honestly the number of cnas/nurses that get injured from helping patients is bananas. \n\nI\u2019ve seen too many people (who are young and healthy) get rotator cuff tears and back injuries from helping patients do things like move off a bed or go to the bathroom. \n\nYour elderly relative absolutely should NOT be doing that. They would both end up hurt.", "NTA - hurray for healthy boundary setting! It sounds like your Grandma wanted and needed you to stand up for her and you did so firmly but politely. The other woman lashed out at you because she needs help and she was thwarted in her own inappropriate attempt to get it. It sounds like you or your grandma involving yourself more with this woman would be a bad idea.", "NTA", "NTA, bravo OP!

It's clear that you care deeply for your grandmother's well-being, and it's understandable that you were concerned about her helping her neighbor with tasks that could potentially put her own health at risk.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that everyone deserves compassion and kindness, regardless of their disability. It's possible that this woman may not have any other support, and it's also possible that she may not have the financial resources to hire a personal caregiver or move into an assisted living facility.\n\nInstead of telling her off, perhaps there could have been a more compassionate way to address the situation. You could have offered to help her find resources for assistance, or offered to connect her with organizations that could provide support.\n\nIt's never easy to navigate these types of situations, but approaching them with empathy and understanding can go a long way in finding a solution that benefits everyone involved.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Asking an elderly person to help physically support them is wrong. An elderly person does NOT have the same physical abilities, health OR heal abilities as a someone in their 20s, 30s or 50s. As a person in her 50s, she knew it too. \n\nWhen a person in their 80s falls, they are very likely to break a hip, shoulder or even a leg or arm. If someone falls on them, they could very easily get broken ribs. It takes months and months to heal these types of injuries: unfortunately, they never heal completely. \nFrankly, elderly people are too physically fragile to do this type of things.  \n\nIn addition, at the time of her stroke, the woman very likely received information on social services available to help her. However, she would also have to put in the time and effort to actually get those services. Or, if all else fails, use the internet to locate services. If she doesn't have it at home, most libraries have it."]}
