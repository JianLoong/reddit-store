That's a terrible situation to be in, and I do feel badly for her, however, I think she was taking advantage of my grandmother's kind heart.\n\nShe was getting my grandmother to help her with various things that, to be quite honest, I felt she REALLY just shouldn't be - i.e, helping her get onto the toilet, in and out of the shower, in and out of bed, etc.\n\nThose are things that, in my opinion, someone cannot be doing for another person, unless they're either family, or a licensed caregiver.

As a person in her 50s, she knew it too. \n\nWhen a person in their 80s falls, they are very likely to break a hip, shoulder or even a leg or arm. If someone falls on them, they could very easily get broken ribs. It takes months and months to heal these types of injuries: unfortunately, they never heal completely. \nFrankly, elderly people are too physically fragile to do this type of things.  \n\nIn addition, at the time of her stroke, the woman very likely received information on social services available to help her.

Don\u2019t steal comments", "It is sad, but not the grandmother's fault.   \n\nMy grandmother is in her late 70s.   I can not imagine her lifting another adult around.   She'd be so at risk for injury.", "It's nobodies fault except maybe societies for how shit our elder care is. I lost both my grandmother's within the last five years. My grandma was 97 pounds soaking wet, and was wheelchair bound at the end. My Nana was fairly robust, even in her mid 80s, until about six months before she passed. If I would have dared tell my Nana to stop helping her friends I would have been in for an earful! And I hope that if my sweet, tiny grandma needed help and had no family or support system, she would have found someone ask kind as OP's grandmother.\n\nIt was a less than ideal situation, and very possibly dangerous for both parties. But I can't fault two old women for just trying to get by."]}
