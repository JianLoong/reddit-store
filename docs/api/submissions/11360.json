As a person in her 50s, she knew it too. \n\nWhen a person in their 80s falls, they are very likely to break a hip, shoulder or even a leg or arm. If someone falls on them, they could very easily get broken ribs. It takes months and months to heal these types of injuries: unfortunately, they never heal completely. \nFrankly, elderly people are too physically fragile to do this type of things.  \n\nIn addition, at the time of her stroke, the woman very likely received information on social services available to help her.

And honestly, even the way you stated things was reasonable to me because people like that don't acknowledge things if you are too polite.", "NTA. You are correct in noting that your grandmother could injure herself caring for this woman. Moreover, your grandmother is not a trained and insured PCA or home health aid, and if she accidentally injures this woman while, say, helping her out of the tub, this woman might str to sue.

If she wants, she could still help out when she wants to and if she can, but only for things she is capable of doing.

It's amazing how people take advantage of the elderly.

She has no cell phone and had no way to get a hold of him or his Wife.  When he returned he acted like nothing happened.

Your grandma can't physically help someone like that.  What if they both fell?", "NTA\n\nI was injured helping someone like this as a 23 year old professional.

The amount of previously fit elderly people that break something and die within weeks of the injury is incredibly high.", "NTA\n\nMy parents are now in their mid-70s and have many friends, neighbors, and family members around the same stages of life. My parents are in very good health and remain highly independent and capable, and they like to help out according their own abilities.\n\nFamily friend \"Lauren\" moved into a nursing home a couple of years ago because she lived alone and was beginning to struggle mentally (possibly some early stages of dementia, but I think a big part of it is brain damage from mismanaged psychiatric care when she was younger). It's located a short walk from my parents' house. My parents bring Lauren over to their house for coffee/dinner/holidays sometimes. The facility where Lauren lives provides a shuttle bus that takes residents out to run errands, but Lauren has difficulty sticking to its schedule, so my parents will drive over and pick her up if Lauren needs to go to the pharmacy or whatever. They've also driven her to doctor's appointments when she has forgotten to arrange for special transport in advance.\n\nMy aunt \"Esther\" and uncle \"George\" live in the same city as my parents for half the year. Both are in very poor health - Esther had breast cancer and has had recurring heart trouble, while George has had lung cancer in the past and has been battling cancer again for the past several years. They remain highly active - George teaches a college course, Esther is a semi-pro photographer and zoo volunteer. But my parents do help them in ways that they are willing to accept. Recently they've been having car trouble, so my parents have been ensuring they get to all their medical appointments etc. while their car is in the shop. My dad helps them load and unload their minivan when they arrive/depart in my parents' city, and my parents store some of their stuff in the attic because my aunt and uncle have a tiny apartment.\n\nTheir neighbor \"Jessica\" has been doing home renovations, but she's not handy and has health issues that would make DIY difficult or dangerous. Dad, on the other hand, is *super* handy and loves a project. He's been able to do some of the work Jessica needs himself, and for everything else, he has the knowledge to inspect the work that Jessica's contractors do and ensure that it's quality.\n\nAn elderly couple in their neighborhood made the decision to move into assisted living together, leaving their single-family home. My parents went over for several days - along with several other neighbors - to help this couple decide what they were keeping and get it packed up for their move, and to get everything they were not taking with them ready to be sold by an estate sale company.\n\nAnother neighbor, \"Alfred,\" declined physical and material assistance. All that he wanted from them was emotional support - a cup of tea and company. He was afraid that getting older meant getting forgotten and discarded. \n\nImportantly, all of these forms of assistance are things my parents *can* do (these actions don't pose any major risks to them and are very similar to tasks they regularly perform for themselves), things they *want to* do (many of these tasks double as social time with loved ones), and things they *are qualified* to do. None of which applies with your grandmother.\n\nEven when my mother was taking care of her own mother in our home (an actual immediate family member!), she was not doing the sort of heavy lifting this stranger is demanding of your grandmother. She had to catheterize Grandma daily to prevent bladder/kidney problems, which is a medical task Mom needed to be trained in but which did not require supporting most/all of Grandma's body weight. And her balance was poor, which meant that she needed to be supported when stepping into/out of the bathtub and that she preferred to be accompanied up and down the stairs so she could hold onto someone's arm in addition to the railing. I was able to help her take walks around the neighborhood by the time I was 10, because all I had to do was be stable and be ready to get help if she did fall down.\n\nIf this neighbor continues to push your grandmother for help she cannot give, or if she begins demanding it of other residents of the building, I don't think you would be out of line to call Adult Protective Services.", "NTA.\n\nYou should let the staff at the facility know, too.", "Nta you were looking out for your grandma.

If the woman is that severely disabled, then she should be in *assisted living* rather than an independent senior living community.\n\nAt this point it isn't about whether or not her family is useless and refusing to help her.  It sounds like she thinks moving into an assisted living facility will result in her losing her independence.  It won't but she will have *trained staff* on hand to help her.  I had a grandparent move into assisted living and she did more activities there than she did when she was living on her own.  They took day trips to parks, casinos, malls and would do grocery runs for her as well.", "NTA. I work in an assisted living facility and have been a caregiver for 3 years.

She worked as a nurse at the local family doctor office. There was this older lady patient who was wheelchair bound. She had bedsores that were slowly getting worse. She was lamenting she couldn't get the surgery because she had no one to feed her birds while she was healing. My mom felt bad and offered to do it. So for awhile my mom would take us with her to care for this lady's birds. She had quite a few cages of them in her basement. She was a hoarder I guess but the birds were pretty well cared for other than I guess they didn't get much human interaction. We'd feed them and change their cages as needed. But the lady still hadn't had surgery yet. My memory is pretty fuzzy but I'm pretty sure my mom and us kids took care of those birds for a few years waiting for this lady to get her surgery. Her sores were getting worse and my mom started to care for her as if she was her nurse. We did all this without pay. Eventually my dad had enough and told her to stop as this lady was just using us. My mom confronted the lady, in a nice way tho. The lady felt bad and paid my mom 1k. As a kid I thought that was so nice. As an adult I realize that's an insult considering all my mom did for her. \n\nSorry for the rant. Just wanted to say people like this are never truly grateful. They are entitled and think everyone should help them. I hope your grandma can move away from this lady. She'll probably try to find other ways to take advantage of her", "NTA. Your grandmother needs to focus her energy on taking care of herself and not this other woman.

If something happened to the neighbour whilst your grandmother was helping her, then she could be sued and even if not found liable, her last years would ruined because of it.", "NTA  Your grandmother wanted to be helpful but it sounds as though she was relieved to be let off doing it.\n\nMaybe she needs some assertiveness training.", "May be an unpopular opinion but there\u2019s no rule that says disabled people can\u2019t be assholes.

I'm also blessed to have two elderly grandparents, and I'm quite protective of them. If I found out about something like this, I would be infuriated. \n\nAlso, I think this woman was knowingly taking advantage of your grandmother, because of her choice of words. \"What are you going to do when you get old?\"\n\nFirstly, she's not old, she just has disabilities. And that sucks and I'm not blaming her for them, but that line is just manipulative. It's nobody elses responsibility to plan for her old age, or for her disabilities. And the risk of your actual elderly grandmother being injured in the course of helping is very, very real. My grandma had a nasty fall late last year while just trying to do a mundane chore. These things happen.\n\nNot to be a debbie downer, but your spry and surprisingly \"young\" grandmother could go from energetic and self sufficient to the opposite very quickly if she were to suffer the wrong kind of injury. Elderly people just can't recover from these things the way younger folks can. Not uncommonly, serious falls can be deadly to the elderly.\n\nSo all in all, fuck that.

It doesn't take a social psychologist to see that anyone living by themselves who is suddenly physically disabled at a fairly young age would be lonely and would leap at the opportunity to spend more time with someone as uplifting and capable as your grandmother. You don't know the subtleties of the various asks that were made of her, or how much your grandmother offered to do without being asked. You said she was overly giving, so naturally I'd assume she was this way with the younger resident (though her behavior is  not ideal). This other less-able woman was doing what many humans in that situation would do, and could honestly be unaware that the level of assistance she'd been receiving had crept to an inappropriate level (also not ideal behavior, so, as above, both are at fault and both seem a little codependent; not an unusual occurrence). Have a little more compassion maybe. Also, it seems you should have asked your grandmother, who you say is lucid, more about the nature of their relationship before throwing on your cape to go rip the rug out from under the other lady. You don't even give her the respect of coming to see her part in this (filling a void her husband left behind). Perhaps, then, the other woman has something to offer your grandmother, and your role could have been to just curtail the inappropriate physical burden. You insult both of those women by barging in on their relationship.", "NTA. Your g'ma is like a lot of women I know, her first reaction is always going to be to help.

The majority of them are subsidized or go off of income if someone does not qualify for state rent assistance. They run anywhere from 400 to $1250 a month. They do not offer any assistance with anything. They are a 55 and older apartment that is generally handicapped accessible and has call lights in the bedroom and bathroom. Those call lights do NOT get anyone help from staff. When pulled, it alerts the on call manager, and the manager will knock on the door or call, if no answer, the manager will call 911 and will open the door for emergency services but in general will NOT enter the apartment. Too many of these instances will cause the tenant to be evicted or a call placed to adult protective services in order for them to be placed in a facility that offers more care.\n\nSource: I worked in healthcare for 25+ yrs with the elderly.", "She may well not be able to manage.
