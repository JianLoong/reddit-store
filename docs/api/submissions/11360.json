That's a terrible situation to be in, and I do feel badly for her, however, I think she was taking advantage of my grandmother's kind heart.\n\nShe was getting my grandmother to help her with various things that, to be quite honest, I felt she REALLY just shouldn't be - i.e, helping her get onto the toilet, in and out of the shower, in and out of bed, etc.\n\nThose are things that, in my opinion, someone cannot be doing for another person, unless they're either family, or a licensed caregiver.

As a person in her 50s, she knew it too. \n\nWhen a person in their 80s falls, they are very likely to break a hip, shoulder or even a leg or arm. If someone falls on them, they could very easily get broken ribs. It takes months and months to heal these types of injuries: unfortunately, they never heal completely. \nFrankly, elderly people are too physically fragile to do this type of things.  \n\nIn addition, at the time of her stroke, the woman very likely received information on social services available to help her.

It's located a short walk from my parents' house. My parents bring Lauren over to their house for coffee/dinner/holidays sometimes. The facility where Lauren lives provides a shuttle bus that takes residents out to run errands, but Lauren has difficulty sticking to its schedule, so my parents will drive over and pick her up if Lauren needs to go to the pharmacy or whatever.

They remain highly active - George teaches a college course, Esther is a semi-pro photographer and zoo volunteer. But my parents do help them in ways that they are willing to accept. Recently they've been having car trouble, so my parents have been ensuring they get to all their medical appointments etc. while their car is in the shop.

He was afraid that getting older meant getting forgotten and discarded. \n\nImportantly, all of these forms of assistance are things my parents *can* do (these actions don't pose any major risks to them and are very similar to tasks they regularly perform for themselves), things they *want to* do (many of these tasks double as social time with loved ones), and things they *are qualified* to do. None of which applies with your grandmother.\n\nEven when my mother was taking care of her own mother in our home (an actual immediate family member!), she was not doing the sort of heavy lifting this stranger is demanding of your grandmother. She had to catheterize Grandma daily to prevent bladder/kidney problems, which is a medical task Mom needed to be trained in but which did not require supporting most/all of Grandma's body weight. And her balance was poor, which meant that she needed to be supported when stepping into/out of the bathtub and that she preferred to be accompanied up and down the stairs so she could hold onto someone's arm in addition to the railing. I was able to help her take walks around the neighborhood by the time I was 10, because all I had to do was be stable and be ready to get help if she did fall down.\n\nIf this neighbor continues to push your grandmother for help she cannot give, or if she begins demanding it of other residents of the building, I don't think you would be out of line to call Adult Protective Services.", "NTA.\n\nYou should let the staff at the facility know, too.", "Nta you were looking out for your grandma.

But the lady still hadn't had surgery yet. My memory is pretty fuzzy but I'm pretty sure my mom and us kids took care of those birds for a few years waiting for this lady to get her surgery. Her sores were getting worse and my mom started to care for her as if she was her nurse. We did all this without pay. Eventually my dad had enough and told her to stop as this lady was just using us. My mom confronted the lady, in a nice way tho. The lady felt bad and paid my mom 1k. As a kid I thought that was so nice.

Have a little more compassion maybe.

It's a very bad situation for your grandmother to be in.     \n\n\nThe neighbor shouldn't be living alone if she needs that level of help.   She needs to be in a facility that provides help -  not bumming help from  elderly residents.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t let my own grandparents do that either. Better to be safe than sorry.

Helping someone on & off the toilet, in & out of the shower, and in & out of bed is WAY beyond neighborly kindness. Not to mention your Grandmother is not trained to do this correctly and is elderly herself. One of my college roommates was an EMT and she got hurt doing a patient transition from chair to stretcher! She was young, fit, and trained! Your grandmother doesn't need the injury risk let alone the liability! NTA", "NTA. My father lived in a senior adult apartment complex. He needed a bit of help with things and qualified for a nurse's assistant/caregiver. They made sure my father had breakfast & lunch, took his meds, made sure his apartment was clean, had adequate food, if his gout & arthritis was acting up, they could assist with personal hygiene and made sure he had supper- usually something he could heat up and eventually got him on the wheels for meals list. \n\nHe was on a fixed income and qualified.

You have a small apartment, depending on cost, it could be a full flat or a bedroom, living room and counter with small fridge and sink. There's staff to help if you need it, medications are often given out but some people get waivers to be self sufficient also. Still they're categorized as medical facilities, not apartments.\n\nApartments for the elderly are like any other apartments, but the people who rent them are supposed to be independent or have help come in. Some have amenities. Some are fancy and have golf courses and movie theaters. They might have a dining room for dinners (hud based) or full restaurants and bars. Activities and van/bus services. Maybe someone who gets trash and leaves newspapers at your door. Depends what you can afford. There's no medical services and they don't answer to the local medical authorities. If they're low income thats another thing.\n\nThen there's step down communities that have large campuses.

I think I was a sophomore in uni at the time, so maybe 19/20 and my mom brought me to the consultation with the facility so I could understand the reality when it might one day become my responsibility to arrange it for her. She's always been kinda morbid/over prepared like that. \n\nIt was a full service nursing home with RNs, PSWs, dietician etc and my aunt and grandpa insisted on a private room. It was $13k/month.

Your grandmother sounds like a sweet woman who deserves to spend her time doing things she would like, rather than taking care of others.", "NTA and the amount of workman comp claims that STNA, aides, nurses, etc have for that kind of lifting is astronomical.  And that includes young, physically fit people.  A woman in her 80's should not be doing that kind of work.   She will end up hurting herself.   That is very hard, physical work.  She was being taken advantage of.", "Definitely NTA, for all of the reasons you listed.

I'm a...somewhat healthy just-shy-of-32 person and doing the caregiving for my Grandma as a full-time job is fucking exhausting. Even tho she weighs only like 100lbs, it's still an effort to get her onto the toilet. It's gotten easier since I developed Grandma-Liftin'-Muscles, but there are still tasks I would not, again as a somewhat healthy individual, do. She had talked about getting into the tub last week for a shower and I had to refuse that particular objective. Ultimately she changed her mind and just wiped off with a wet towel, but I was pretty firm on that one. There are things we are not trained to, physically capable of, or willing to do.\n\nAnd your 84 years young Grandma should not be doing *any* of that. There are injury risks to everyone doing this kind of work...and at 84 that can be devastating.

The disabled woman might just need some PT to get her back to being more independent. Could very easily be a situation where she stopped therapy due to COVID and lost some strength.

No, it's a long drawn out process, but she needs to at least try it.", "Yes, what you do is right. You were protecting your grandmother.

She's still in pain because at that age, our bodies simply do not recover that easily...\n\nI literally gasped when i read your grandma helped a fully grown woman out of the bed and shower.

I'm sorry she's disabled but your elderly grandmother is not the right choice. I wonder how many other neighbors she pulled this on before your grandmother.

All his medical care was off site and paid for by medicare/supplemental separate from his monthly rent.\n\nIf you needed higher levels of care while at this facility, the costs went up quickly, topping out at $12K/month for \"memory care\" (Alzheimer's care). Yikes!", "Yes, it does, I've been doing this for a long time, and the government insurance that is for seniors pays for skilled nursing care for the disabled who can not care for themselves such as this woman.", "Doesn't it seem like prices of things are just...it's like they're just invented, you know?  They just add a zero to the amounts people can ACTUALLY afford.

Which I'm sure she was more than capable of doing. \n \nYou walked right down the hall and 'handled it' -  which is incredibly ageist of you (treating your Grandmother and the other woman like they were children).  You interfered with your Grandma's life instead of talking it out and letting her go handle it. Arguably this woman was her Friend and you sort of slapped her down didn't you?\nHeck, you could have accompanied your Grandmother down the hall and that would have been fine. Been her backup in case she faltered.\n\nBy your own description, there is nothing wrong with your Grandmother other than - she's older.   And you completely took away her self-determination and ability to speak for herself. (That's never what we should do to our elder members trust me).\n\nAlso, the other woman didn't deserve that.  Obviously, your Grandmother was pitching in - and neither of them saw anything wrong with it. \nThey should have realized it could be dangerous for your Grandma but that's humans for you - no matter the age.  \n\nLet me tell you about my sister caring for her husband with Parkinson's until he died at home.  (They were affluent enough to be able to afford to have a helper in the in-law apartment). They still had to call EMS when he fell because he never lost weight until the last month or two of his life - she's 5 ft 6 and he was over 6 ft tall and a broad man. \nMost people can't manage that - and have to figure out other solutions. (They had every piece of transfer equipment they needed and it was still hard as hell).\nThat's what your Grandma and her friend did - they worked out another solution - and who is to say that wasn't keeping your Grandma young?  She wants to be a helper - so I suggest you find her somewhere she can pitch in without compromising her health (a soup kitchen or something where she has people contact comes to mind).\n\nAs for the other woman - kindly put her in contact with the Center for Aging(in your local town) they should be able to put her in touch with an agency that can help her.  She needs Assistive living - not the setup your Grandma has.   Obviously, she does not have family to step in.  \n\nBe a good person and make the call. Or ask your Grandma to - if they're still on speaking terms.  \nThat or let someone know at the center your Grandma lives in know, a manager etc., I'm sure they're familiar with folks \"aging out\" of their program or needing more help coming in.", "NTA.

I think your firmness was probably necessary so she knows she can no longer take advantage.", "\"When I had a similar conversation with my Grandma, she agreed that helping this woman like that really wasn't a good idea.
