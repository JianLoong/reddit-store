A ring doorbell is a security measure, so people can see who is outside their building, particularly if there are cars in the driveway or other things outside the house that have value and that someone else might try to vandalize or steal.   Not only that, but it's something that the landlord attached to their property, and it's not up to the tenant to alter the property. \n\nI think your concern is misplaced. Not everything is about you and what you're doing. A ring doorbell is a poor way to spy on someone inside the house, because, duh, it's outside. It doesn't record or notice indoor conversations. It shows who comes & goes & who is on the property, not what they do once they're inside the building.  YWBTA if you uninstall the ring doorbell.

This certainly seems like it would be the easiest solution. Bonus points for it being frustrating to her mom since she\u2019d be unable to troubleshoot a network error from afar.", "This is the best answer, I think.  Doorbell cams can be great for security, but not if it makes you feel less secure because you think somebody is using it to watch your coming and goings.  If you have full control over your home network (which you should), just block it from being able to use your network.  Also, check to see if anything else suspicious is connected to your network.  Most ISP routers have the ability to show you what is or was connected.", "Pretty good idea!", "This is a great idea. Wind chimes are super annoying. If you can't keep a photo mounted, smear Vaseline or peanut butter on the lens every few days.", "I've also thought of this. I would not put it past her", "There's no contract. \nI should have thought things through more before I moved in but she pretty much has full control of my life now.

I'll leave it installed and just cover it. Definitely a better idea", "I'll probably cover it with tape!

She preferred it that way", "Oh.  You should probably try to move, or get the bills transferred to your name.  This sounds a lot like financial abuse and perhaps you should check out r/raisedbynarcissists for more information/support. Its definitely not healthy or normal for her to be micromanaging you this way.  I wish you the best of luck.  \n\nAlso, the router in your house has the password on the back/bottom.   You should be able to change the password to the wifi, \"for security purposes\" maybe you \"think a neighbor was using it\"....  \n\nAlso, if the router was unplugged for a bit, and during that time one of the doorbell wires on the back of the Ring were to come loose a little bit, it wouldn't get power and that would be so tragic, wouldn't it?  \n\nI'm in a similar situation with a controlling parent, sometimes the fights are just their way of discouraging you to have boundaries.   Since it is her house, without a proper contract you really don't have a legal leg to stand on.  Moving would be best, but if you can't do that there are things you can do to establish boundaries.  And I encourage you to do that at your own pace.", "it doesn't matter that it is the mother's house, she is a landlord at this point not a mother and there are privacy laws for tenants for a reason.
