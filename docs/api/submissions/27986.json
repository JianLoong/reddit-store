She bought a muscle car for my nephew so he could go to college in a nice whip, and a luxury SUV for my niece -who's been acting like a total brat for a while; disrespectful, rude, and mean- for her senior year in high school. \n\nI'm not saying that my sister has been perfect in this equation, but every parent deserves respect from their children.\n\nSo, in our last conversation, when she called moping and whining about her children disappointing her, I told her that she had been enabling their behavior. She lashed out at me, saying that she was just trying to give them what she didn't have, and that she wanted to be a good mom, that she didn't understand why my nephew was acting stupid at school, since he was always nice and responsible at home.\"Really?\" I said, \"He was always always responsible because you were always around. Now he's alone, he thinks he's an adult, and he's just going crazy without supervision! Besides, you're enabling them, spoiling them with cars that are better than yours!
