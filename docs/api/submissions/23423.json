Recently, her fianc\u00e9, lets call him Josh, had proposed to her. She invited the entire family and a few of her friends to the wedding. 4 days before the wedding I was cycling around the neighbourhood I live in. i accidentally took a sharp turn and planted face first into the concrete. I bruised my leg, part of my face and arms. Unfortunately, I thought I shouldn\u2019t go to the wedding. This reached my sister a few hours after I came back home and started treating my scar. And I tell you, she was furious. She told me that because of some dumb scar I can\u2019t come to a relatives birthday. She also accused me of doing this on purpose just so I wouldn\u2019t have to see her friend (my ex). About 1 hour later I got an entire paragraph from my mother, stating t?\nhat I am a liar and a selfish person. There we\u2019re 2 main reasons why I couldn\u2019t attend the wedding. 1st, after the crash I felt extremely nauseous and dizzy. 2nd, I could not dare to walk into a public area with a large, bright red dot on my forehead. My husband, lets call him Damien, also decided not to go to the wedding due to the way my sister treats me. During the time I am writing this, it is 3 days before the wedding and I still feel extremely sick. My mother is scolding me for not being able to attend a wedding for a medical event. She says that my sister has attended all of my important events, my graduation, my own wedding, etc. I accept that, but getting bombarded by angry messages from my mom because I got hurt is horrible in my eyes.

I'm not sure you can truthfully say you're cancelling because of a medical event for which you don't receive any medical treatment.  Your sister (hopefully) only gets married once in her life and doesn't care what you look like.

Third, if OP's reasoning was ONLY because of the red mark on their face, then I would be inclined to say YTA.

I don't get why people get so pissed off over people not going to a wedding because of a medical event.
