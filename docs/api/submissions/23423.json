Recently, her fianc\u00e9, lets call him Josh, had proposed to her. She invited the entire family and a few of her friends to the wedding. 4 days before the wedding I was cycling around the neighbourhood I live in. i accidentally took a sharp turn and planted face first into the concrete. I bruised my leg, part of my face and arms. Unfortunately, I thought I shouldn\u2019t go to the wedding. This reached my sister a few hours after I came back home and started treating my scar. And I tell you, she was furious. She told me that because of some dumb scar I can\u2019t come to a relatives birthday. She also accused me of doing this on purpose just so I wouldn\u2019t have to see her friend (my ex). About 1 hour later I got an entire paragraph from my mother, stating t?\nhat I am a liar and a selfish person. There we\u2019re 2 main reasons why I couldn\u2019t attend the wedding. 1st, after the crash I felt extremely nauseous and dizzy. 2nd, I could not dare to walk into a public area with a large, bright red dot on my forehead. My husband, lets call him Damien, also decided not to go to the wedding due to the way my sister treats me. During the time I am writing this, it is 3 days before the wedding and I still feel extremely sick. My mother is scolding me for not being able to attend a wedding for a medical event. She says that my sister has attended all of my important events, my graduation, my own wedding, etc. I accept that, but getting bombarded by angry messages from my mom because I got hurt is horrible in my eyes.

This is where you talk about being tired all the time, or that you think you developed a mild allergy, or long term concerns about your health in general. A mole that changed color or shape, it hurts when you put your arm this way, you tried a gluten free diet for a month and it helped a lot... all that is for primary care.\n\n2) Urgent care offices. These are for kids with a high fever, people who fell off a bike but didn't break any bones an hour ago, infected small wounds, what is this rash, and other urgent but not life-threatening issues. Some parts of the USA do not have many of these yet, they are relatively new since the ACA was passed. I don't know if the ACA made them or if they just started popping up around when that law took effect because more people have health insurance. They also close at night in non-urban areas, so if you can't get to one you go to option 3 for anything after hours no matter what. \n\n3) The Emergency Room of a hospital. Unless you have something scheduled, if you are headed to a hospital you are going in the ER. This is the first choice for \"I might be dying\" issues, but both the first two options can send you there if you underestimated how sick you were (as I once did with a pregnancy complication.) One time I was released after a surgery, felt absolutely horrible and started running a fever two days later. To the ER with me, and they kept me for another 3 days. Still dizzy and nauseous a day after you hit your head? To the ER with her, there are a lot of things very wrong that this could be a symptom of.

Sister heard it via third party) and then the text from her mom. She'd already canceled at some point due to \"extreme nausea\" but then states she actually only felt a \"small nausea wave.\" \n\nWhich sounds to me like she exaggerated her fall for her family to avoid going to the wedding.\n\nAnd you know what?

I don't want to miss your wedding, but I may not be able to attend.\" That would have been a lot more understandable.

The partner should absolutely take her side, but if the sisters are really as close as OP states, then she'd do anything to be there, and the partner taking her side should be in the form of \"hey, you're really going to be upset if you miss your sister's wedding. Let's try to go and at least sit and watch the ceremony, and then we can leave if you're still not feeling well.\" If they're actually close, then he'd find a way to help her be there, not make the situation even worse by also causing drama with the family.\n\n4.

OP is not operating from a logical place.", "This could all be bc they have a concussion or/and may not typically be an English speaker\u2026", "Or it's the head injury. \n\nI have migraines and the laptop screen is harsh on my eyes but sometimes its also for some odd reason the only thing I do to distract myself from the pain. \n\nThere are no clear cut correct way to have issues with your head.   \n\n\nOP clearly needs medical attention and a family that gives a hoot she needs medical attention.", "No, this is way too much.\nRemember that people are different. You struggle with screens when you're dizzy, maybe she was able to deal with it enough to inquire about a problem she's currently facing. And it's a lot of judgement on a character based on this post. \n\nYeah she says she's bruised, doesn't mean she also needed to treat a scar.\n\nOP might feel she and sister have a great relationship. Doesn't mean husband has to like how he sees OPs family is treating her.\n\nClear inconsistency is the part where she says birthday, but I agree with what people say- OP might not be doing good.\n\nI'm sorry, but I don't like this level of reach. I'm drawing some lines and analysis here as well, but I can't treat anything as clear conclusion cus I don't know OP. I say she *might* be this *might* feel like that. just based on her post. but no hard conclusion on her as a person.\nI can't just by this post. Neither can you.\n\nGoing by the post and what she's asking, no she's NTA in that situation.", "Actually, sounds like ESL.", "Have you ever had a traumatic brain injury? If so, how did you act in the hours and days after it? If not, F off.", "Talk to text and predictive text are both a thing. \n\nIf she is banged up, people will be asking her about it and that will piss the sister off as well. But her mother immediately calling her a liar and selfish is really extreme. She's either hurt or she's not, and it should be really easy to prove to her mother. And her *husband* won't go because of how her sister treated her during this.", "Memorial day weekend.....my little brother(39)comes limping into our oldest brothers house for a family cookout in the backyard. Why was he limping?? 6 weeks earlier he was fishing opening day at my other brothers camp. They were deep frying potatoes outside. He walked past the fryer, his pant leg caught on the edge of the fryer and the boiling grease poured down his leg. It degloved his leg from his knee to his ankle. He refused to go to the ER. He cooled it down,  put antibiotic ointment on it and wrapped it. Every day after, twice a day, unwrapped it, took off dead skin, cleaned it, more antibiotic cream and rewrapped. Even went back to work, though his boss kept him off the roofs for a while. Just because someone refuses to go to the ER, doesn't mean the injury isn't serious. As for screen time. I woke up from a 12 day coma from multi system organ failure due to extreme septic shock. I was hooked up to continuous dialysis, a machine was breathing for me via a tracheostomy. I had also endured a 6.5 minute full cardiac arrest...I was dizzy, bright lights made me nauseous...hell, the machine breathing for me made me nauseous. My family brought in my laptop...it was my only means of communicating because my fine motor skills were affected and I could not write properly...from the lack of oxygen to the brain and from ulcerated sores on my hands from hypoxia. I could push buttons and keys though. You all acting like you know what someone can and can't do and using the knowledge you don't have to try and determine if this person is really injured. Stop.", "True. But that's what her partner is for. They should be taking care of her and helping her make decisions. Like go to the ER.", "To me the post absolutely reads like she hadn't been to the doctor. If she has been and she wasn't concussed, then she's ditching the wedding because of a scar. So the only way the sister is TA in my eyes is if OP went to the doctor, found out she's concussed, told her family but is keeping it a secret from us. Even then, that's assuming the sister heard about the concussion and ignored it. \n\nBut anyway, I don't want to argue with you. I'm also partial to milksteak, and to little green ghouls.", "That's why the YTAs are blowing my mind. Of course OP is acting odd, they have a concussion. It feels like such little sympathy", "Oh yeah, either this is made up or OP needs to get checked out by a medical practice professional now. I'm really hoping if it is true they've seen this and been seen. At least if there's a husband then hopefully they aren't alone so there's someone to get them there!", "At six days postpartum I was posting weird stuff on Facebook because I was starting to have a seizure from postpartum eclampsia. I said some weird stuff to my husband as well and don\u2019t even remember it because there\u2019s like a twelve hour chunk of my life that I was not thinking or talking clearly\u2026and nearly died.", "I had a massive concussion nearly 10yrs ago. I'm 32.

If you rather have an undiagnosed head injury that\u2019s on you. Yes healthcare costs suck, death is worse.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from. Where I\u2019m from there\u2019s nothing but fields and highways, so it isn\u2019t safe nor sensible to use bikes as transportation. Instead it\u2019s just considered a recreational activity. But there are a lot of places where it\u2019s totally normal to ride a bike instead of driving.", "It sounds scary. Who figured out that you needed emergency care, your husband or your friends on Facebook? \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re still with us.  :-)", "My husband. He had returned to work that day for the first time since kiddo was born\u2026but he was concerned as I was in pain from swollen legs that had been dismissed by the hospital staff when I was discharged at three days postpartum and I had a horrible migraine as well. My kid sis was there with me and baby as she was due to fly out to Taiwan to teach English for the summer, but she didn\u2019t realize what was going on with me. When I talked with my husband on the phone before he left work he told me I should call and talk to my doctor and see if the doctor felt we should go to the ER. EVIDENTLY the doctor did think I should go but I hung up and told my husband I was fine. Posted a pic of the kiddo on Facebook and was struggling to read the responses and to be able to tell the time on the clock on the wall. Husband came in and asked me how I was doing and I told him I couldn\u2019t see very well. That was the last thing I remember until the next morning. He evidently freaked out and called 911 and then called his best friend whose wife is a NICU nurse and the best friend got my sis to the airport while she came to get the baby for the night\u2026meanwhile my husband followed the ambulance and contacted my parents who drove in from their home three hours away. Super scary and if I hadn\u2019t been looking for signs of trouble it could have happened again with my second child\u2026but I insisted we go to the ER at five days postpartum and they told me that probably saved my life. Needless to say\u2026we were done having kids after the second one!!\n\nThough it was definitely friends online who saved my life another time when I was hemorrhaging after a bad miscarriage\u2026they insisted that I was bleeding WAY too much and should go to the ER. That was in between my first and second kid. Definitely scarred me\u2026the whole kid-having thing, though I wouldn\u2019t trade my little punks for anything!!"]}
