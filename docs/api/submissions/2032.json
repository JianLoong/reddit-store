Pregnancy cravings don\u2019t give you the right to steal other people\u2019s food. Replace them, apologize and control yourself.", "YTA due to clarification SIL has diabetes. Those gummies were important for her on top of pregnancy not being a valid response to taking other people's stuff when there clearly wasn't an understanding they were communal.

They were not your sweets, you shouldn't have eaten them, especially finishing off a bag, it's just rude and disrespectful.

Just because your pregnant didn't mean you lack self control. If the understanding is her food is separate and you knew it was hers but felt like your needs mattered most, you're in the wrong. Just because she's living with you doesn't mean you're entitled to her stuff.\n\nIf it's not clear her food is separate that's different. But either way, you can't use the pregnancy card to just do whatever you want regardless of other people's feelings.", "YTA imo.  \n\n\nPutting the question about her being diabetic aside, you don't touch food or snacks that don't belong to you or were openly discussed to be okay if one consumed them.  \nPregnancy isn't a free ticket to exclude you from that, especially if you didn't think about replacing them - which doesn't sound like you did.  \n\n\nIf there truly was a medical need for L to have them, even if she still has other candy, I can't even comprehend how you could ask if it makes you the AH. I mean, do pregnancy cravings somehow invalidate other people's medical needs?  \n\n\nAsk your partner to keep a stash of candy specifically for you in case of emergancy.", "YTA, besides not doing this in the first place, here's what you should've done after eating her gummies\n\nYou should've informed L immediately with a text, and offered some money to buy new snacks.  Part of the big issue isn't just that you took the gummies, its that she didn't know you did until later if she had needed them and they weren't there.  That could've been a huge issue.\n\nAt this point apologize profusely.  It is a big deal.  They aren't just candy for her.", "YTA, but your own sweets.

But SHE HAS DIABETES?! Even if there's something else around sugary if she needs it, you took what she knows works for her.

You didn\u2019t ask first and your SIL is diabetic which means she most likely relies on the gummy bears to keep her blood sugar regulated which is far more life-or-death than a pregnancy craving.", "YTA. You don\u2019t eat other people\u2019s food! Like wtf is so difficult to understand about that. Don\u2019t use your pregnancy as an excuse to do things that you\u2019re not supposed to.

The worst part through, is how you didn't even apologize or offer to replace them. You just excused yourself with pregnancy cravings which, while they are real, are not so strong as to overpower all other rational thought. You didn't even offer to replace them yourself; you got in a huff and said if your husband was so pissed *he* could go replace them.\n\nYTA...you're a selfish asshole.", "YTA You stole your SIL's food that was for life threatening emergencies because you were too lazy to go buy your own food. Why you thought that was ok is mind boggling. \n\nHelping yourself to other people's things out of laziness is bad enough. Taking something you know they need for an emergency is horrible.", "YTA. Show some self control maybe", "YTA Being pregnant does not excuse bad behavior. Buy are a big replacement bag and keep your fingers out.", "Of course YTA I'm absolutely baffled that you feel pregnancy entitles you to someone else's things", "YTA, being pregnant doesn't mean you're suddenly a 3 y old with zero self control, *especially* when the food you took was for medical emergencies.", "YTA seriously buy your own or send hubby to get some... or ASK FIRST. How are you even questioning if ur TA here? Smh", "YTA. Pregnancy hormones do not excuse poor behaviour. Apologise and buy her a replacement bag.", "YTA for stealing someone else's food. You're BEYOND being an AH for stealing your diabetic SIL's gummy bears. And the shit sprinkles on your AH sundae is you trying to leave that out of your post.", "YTA\n\nWhat's worse is that you already know that, that's why you tried to burry the fact she is diabetic in the \"why I might be the AH\" section.  You ate her medicine. \n\nYou ate an item she uses in emergencies to STAY ALIVE!  And then thought that it was trivial, because \"she has other candy in the house.\"  Different foods hit blood different, this candy is not equal to that candy in the tummy of a person with diabetes. \n\nWhat's next? Gonna take grandads oxygen tank, then tell him there's air all around?", "YTA. I get really annoyed when pregnant women feel like the world owes them everything when they get knocked up. No, the world owes you nothing. You stole and used pregnancy to justify it.", "YTA. Glad I checked the comments. You stole something from your SIL that could save her life and edited your post to prevent people from finding out that she\u2019s diabetic.

I've been pregnant 5 times now (currently 9 months with #5) and I'm sorry you can absolutely hold cravings off. It sucks to hold off yes, but you could've gone to the damn store yourself and you should've replaced them immediately.

The best thing you could\u2019ve done is gone to the store to buy more gummies to replenish hers or better yet just buy your own.", "YTA, you do NOT take candy from a diabetic person, no matter the reason, going to the store for candy for a diabetic person when they need it means that they could be dead by the time you're back. Diabetes is not a joke. You ask first (I mean you should always ask first even if the person isn't diabetic). Pregancy isn't an excuse. You really need to apologize to them immediately and learn from this. Next time you have a carving you either go to the store or ask your fiance to get you something from the store.", "YTA  she's diabetic, do you understand you possibly put her life in jeopardy? Unlikely scenario but certainly not out of the realm of possibility. Pregnancy doesn't excuse this, in fact you saying that kinda makes you come off even worst. You have a moment where you can be introspective here and really have a character building moment or you can try to justify putting a diabetic at risk. Think carefully here. What if it was your baby with diabetes and someone took their possibly lifesaving \"candy\".", "You\u2019d think mentioning your SIL is diabetic should have been on the actual OP rather than on the reasons; which makes you even a bigger YTA. Seems to me you were hoping people would skip that part.\n\nHer illness aside, you\u2019re still an AH; they were not yours so you should ask before taking someone else\u2019s property.\n\nEdit: I forgot a very important word on the first line", "YTA, they weren\u2019t yours and being pregnant doesn\u2019t excuse your poor, inconsiderate behaviour.\n\nBuy her another packet and learn from this: if it\u2019s not yours, you don\u2019t take it.", "Yta don\u2019t take food that doesn\u2019t belong to you!

And big time. From a person who had been pregnant 3 times. Learn some restraint and get some parenting classes for your morals ffs, I worry about your kid(s). Might be mean, but hey, better to get some tough love now and fix that shit than later.", "YTA ....being pregnant doesn't entitle you to things people have bought for themselves. \n\nAt the same time it doesn't need to be such a big deal. I hear they have multiple bags of gummy bears at most stores these days so you can probably get more.\n\nEdit: ok, I appear to have missed that SIL is diabetic. You're still TA and it is a big deal, which I missed but will let the comment stand for context for this edit.", "YTA. She\u2019s diabetic. Even if there is other candy in the house, gummy bears are useful because they consistently only have a few g of sugar per bear, so she can adjust based on how much she needs. \n\nEven that aside, PREGNANCY IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO BE A SELFISH AND ENTITLED JERK!!!", "YTA \n\nYou seen that there was only a few left, so instead of leaving them and A) going to get some yourself B) asking if you can have them or  C) getting some delivered instacart, uber eats etc, you just ate them.\n\nYou say that she has other stuff but so did you. I doubt that the gummy bears was the only source food in the house. Being pregnant, cravings or not, does not entitle you to others food that they bought themselves. \n\nL might be on a tight budget with being a student, getting ready to move and that was meant to last her till she next went shopping.

It's not cute or quirky to blame a fetus for your lack of manners or regard for other people's needs. If anything, becoming a parent should make you realize that you're about to be a role model and need to rethink if your actions line up with the values you wish to pass on.", "Right? \nThe first rule of being around a diabetic is \u201cDO NOT EAT THEIR FOOD\u201d \n\nNot their French fries. Not their pickle. Not the bag of candy in the pantry.

OP's lack of accountability is insulting.", "Right, forgive me if I'm wrong, but is it not entirely possible she might need them as soon as she walked in the door? Maybe having a weird moment where she suddenly dropped while she was driving home and didn't have any more snacks with her (people run out sometimes.

Control yourself lady.", "I always think that women who claim they can\u2019t control themselves with a pregnancy craving are just bullshitting. When I was pregnant, I had some pretty intense cravings but I couldn\u2019t indulge them because of gestational diabetes. I even had emergency gummy bears just in case I needed them for my diabetes. Despite all my sugar cravings, I didn\u2019t end up eating the gummy bears or indulging more than I could take. I certainly never ate anything that was someone else\u2019s if I thought that it was going to be problematic, despite having intense cravings for those things. \n\nSure, you have crazy cravings when you\u2019re pregnant. Sure, it feels like you\u2019re gonna cry and it\u2019s gonna be the end of the world if you can\u2019t indulge them.

Not saying thats what happened at all. But it could have.", "My theory is that the women that turn into demanding garbage disposal nightmare machines during pregnancy are the ones who have internalized so much sexist food shaming and eating disorder bullshit that they spend every day of their lives denying themselves what they want to eat, and pregnancy is the only time they feel like they have permission to eat everything they've always wanted to but weren't \"allowed to\" before.\n\nI have no proof, so this is really just a hunch, could be wrong.", "Speaking as somebody who is currently pregnant with a baby that feels like it's literally trying to break out of my rib cage.....you're not far off \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso, YTA OP. I've had cravings for gummy candy and I go buy my own. One of my biggest pet peeves is people who eat other people's food and snacks. If you want something so badly, go buy it yourself. There are times when I have desperately wanted something that my husband bought for himself, so I go buy my own or ask him if I can have some. I would also never finish off something that belonged to somebody else. It's one thing to eat a small handful of gummies from a full bag and quite another to finish the leftovers and not replace them before their absence was noted.", "As someone who has been pregnant before, and had 'morning sickness' that lasted all day every day for 5 months, you're not really wrong!\n\nI had such a hard time due to constant vomiting, and I struggled to put on weight. I was basically a zombie.

No. YTA. End of story.", "As someone who has type 1 diabetes I can say that I would be upset if someone ate my candy that I use to treat low blood sugars. \n\nOP, YTA big time for eating her gummy bears. When you have a low blood sugar there are things that work better than others for treatment. So you had a craving? Go to the store and buy some. Better yet, go buy her several bags to replenish what you ate and to try to make some peace. \n\nI hope to God you don't develop gestational diabetes and learn how crappy it feels to deal with.", "But it doesn't matter! OP had a craving! The only risk for the SIL was dying, not anything as terrible as not having a craving met! OP, is pregnant! The world revolves around her!

That\u2019s what makes this so much worse. It\u2019s bad enough to steal a diabetics low sugar contingency, but to take it *and not tell them*?

That stuck with me.", "I had gestational diabetes for those thst don't know it's diabetes that occurs during pregnancy. I didn't have it before nor after just during pregnancy.  So I had to watch myself and go on a special diet or the baby could have been born too big. \n\nI wanted cake frosting and cinnamon churros all the time but I had to control myself. Was it awful? Yes jt was lol but I still did it. So I agree with you.

I'm pregnant too. But being pregnant doesn't give you the right to steal.  You didn't ask, you didn't replace, you didn't think it was a big deal, and therefore you didn't apologize.\n\nGo get your SIL ten of the biggest bags of gummy bears you can find, apologize and change your behavior.
