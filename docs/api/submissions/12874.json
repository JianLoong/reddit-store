My daughter asked me to post this to prove that I'm wrong. I'm writing this from my own perspective of course, but I'll try to be as neutral as possible.\n\nI'm a married man in his 50s, working in the field of quantum computing. My wife also works in a STEM related field and we have 3 daughters together at the ages 21, 17, 14.\n\nI've always pushed my daughters to excel in maths as I think it's the basis for most of the important jobs today. It's also such a fun and beautiful subject on its own, but I guess not everyone sees it that way, like my daughters. They're all quite good at maths, especially my oldest, but they prefer to spend their time on TikTok and Instagram and not do something more useful.\n\nMy oldest was recently discharged from the army and she still lives with us. She wants to become an influencer, a makeup artist or an actress, and spends most of her time trying to achieve that goal. Just the other day, she spent hours changing her nail polish a million times and taking pictures of her nails. I have nothing against actors and I know how hard their job is. But I also know how hard it is to become a successful one and make a living out of it. I also have nothing against makeup artists, and based on the countless makeovers that I got from my daughter, I'm sure she could be a great one. I just don't think the pay is good enough. Influencers on the other hand... I simply don't understand their role and contribution to society, but maybe that's because I'm too old.\n\nMy wife and I both want our daughters to get higher education, preferably in a STEM field, to help them secure a good job and be independent. My oldest strongly objects to that (even though she could get into any program that she wants with her grades), and wants to pursue her own interests. I told her that if she doesn't want to study then she can't live with us rent free anymore doing whatever she does. She could either leave our house, find a job to pay her rent, and not expect my wife and I to support her if she doesn't succeed in pursuing her interests; or she could go studying and stay rent free with us if she wanted, while being free to pursue her interests in her spare time. My daughter is understandably very upset about it and thinks that I'm sabotaging her dreams without even giving her a chance. She says that she doesn't like maths and studying for a degree would be a waste of her time. I think the options I gave her are more than fair and she also needs to understand that she sets an example for her younger sisters who seem to follow her steps.

As long as you aren't trying to force her into STEM and she pursues another field to study in, I think you're ok.\n\nI wouldn't want to have my adult kid to stay at home and be a social medica influencer. How long will she try to be a mooch and hope she gets a \"break\" on social media? \n\nThe longer someone is out of the workforce, the harder it will be to get back in.", "ESH\n\nLook.  There are ten thousand jobs between maths / STEM and vague nail polish influencer.  \n\nShe needs to find her way. But trade or vocational school, more specialized post secondary education, etc. Are all good options.  Not sure degree or nothing is the stance to take.  \n\nBut you are completely fair to say pursue education or the free ride ends.", "Your daughter was in the military, and theoretically has a grasp of what being an adult is all about.  It's not living off your parents.  If she has a solid business plan for becoming an influencer and some amount of initial success, then she might have a case to ask for your support.  As it is, it's a vague dream of making money playing around while someone else foots the bills.  All the good grades, being good at \"maths\" and having a lucrative career stuff aside, this is about whether the young woman is entitled to live off her parents.  I'm going to go with 'no'.  NTA for setting expectations for your children to establish their own lives and identities.", "NTA. \n\nInfluencers are the bane of society, and no one can convince me otherwise. \n\nThe irony of her wanting you to essentially pay for her rent (house bills / mortgage) and expenses while she pursues influencing as a career is lost on her. If she could make a career of it, she could\u2019ve moved out and paid her own rent. \n\nAs long as you\u2019re willing to equally support her getting a non stem degree, you have been more than fair. Study and live with you or don\u2019t and figure out her own life.", "NTA. Yes, she is free to pursue her dreams but she also needs to be an adult and pay her way. Letting her live at home is fantastic security but as an adult she should be happy to contribute. I would probably have an open and non judgemental conversation with her about how she is pursuing these fields. Ask her for her plan of action and where she is at in this process? If she wants to become a makeup artist I'm fairly sure there is a cosmetology qualification she should be looking to pursue. For becoming an influencer ask her what she is doing to step into that space? What work has she done on learning social media and algorithms? What niche is she looking to step into? Does she know how to market? What is market saturation like for her niche?\n\nYou need to give her the freedom to choose something that isn't STEM though. Support her in her choice but you are ok to ask her to study or get a job.", "NTA. If she isn't going to school and studying, she should be working and contributing to her expenses. You don't have to charge what real rent would cost her, but a couple hundred dollars is definitely reasonable. If she doesn't think so, then it is time she move out and see how far influencing gets her.", "NTA. She should be allowed to pursue whatever career she wants but she doesn't get to mooch off you while she pursues it. It's totally reasonable to expect her to either go to school with a degree in mind or pay rent. She can't expect to live rent free as an adult with no job and not being in school.", "NAH - It's understandable that you want her to pursue something with a greater chance of financial stability. You're under no obligation to subsidize your daughter's career plans. \n\nLikewise, she shouldn't be seeking a degree in something that doesn't interest her. Lots of people take courses that make their parents happen but leave them miserable. Living someone else's dream is no way to live.", "NTA. Just don't force her into a STEM program. There are lots of worthwhile jobs that aren't STEM based.", "INFO: is getting a job and paying rent to you not an option?", "NTA.  I'm all for your daughter following her dreams as long as she is the one footing the bill.  Which includes a place to live, food, insurance, etc.  She can certainly get a job and follow her dream on the side.  Then once she becomes successful in those pursuits she can ditch the job that's been paying her bills and do the other full time.", "Info: would you still support her if she got a degree in the arts?", "As far as expecting your daughter to either get a job or go to school, you're NTA. Your daughter is an adult, so your request is very reasonable. \n\nHaving said that, however, you ARE TA for imposing your choice of studies on her. There are many other fields of study that can lead to a lucrative career other than STEM classes. \n\nAs far as influencers go, it's hit or miss. Most people miss, of course. However, those influencers who gain  sponsorship actually earn a very good annual income. \n\nSo, how about making a deal with your daughter? How about giving her a certain amount of time to get her influencer career launched? If she starts to gain corporate sponsors and earn an income, then leave her be. If her channel fails to net any results, then she should agree to find another job.", "YTA. I was on the fence until I read your comments. It\u2019s reasonable to expect her to work or study but demanding she study what you want her to study is not ok", "I\u2019m gonna ignore everything you said about maths being the basis for \u201cimportant jobs\u201d as if other jobs can\u2019t be important, and the implication that her girly influencer interests are useless. YT-A for that, to be honest, BUT you\u2019re NTA for wanting your daughter to get a degree and make a living. She\u2019s 21 and can\u2019t float on your money forever. She needs to put in the work one way or another. \n\nI\u2019d say a middle ground would perhaps be a degree or tradeschool where she can hone her craft. Like Fashion. Or Cosmetology. The simple truth is, in this economy, getting a degree or certification is critical. And if she doesn\u2019t get an education, she needs to really start hustling now, develop a concrete and realistic career strategy, network with folks in that field of work, and show proof of her efforts. Give her a deadline. If she doesn\u2019t start making money off her interests by x time, then she\u2019s out. It doesn\u2019t need to be math, but she does need to put in the work for whatever it is she\u2019s trying to pursue.", "NTA. While I think you could have approached this in a better way; being able to make it as an artist or an influencer off of social media is a one in a million chance. Many of those influencers and artists have partners they can rely on finical support from or have a second job to help pay the bills. Your ultimatum of either School or a job also makes sense. She is an adult she needs to contribute one way or another and can't sit around waiting for the \"big break\".", "NTA. We don't need anymore influencers and trying to become one as a goal is horrible. To actually be a makeup artist you have to have a license, just making videos and taking pictures doesn't make anyone a makeup artist.  Making videos as a career is not a sustainable career for 99% of people so no, NTA.", "NTA to expecting your unemployed adult daughter to get a job and pursue her interests. That\u2019s life for most people. It\u2019s odd that she thinks you should support her dreams and interests just because. You didn\u2019t mention how she did in school, but I hope you\u2019re encouraging your other daughters in school as well. Hopefully, you are supportive in all of their educational endeavors even if it\u2019s not maths. Good luck!", "NAH for telling her she needs to find a job and leave but Y T A for being so unsupportive. If she understands the consequences of following her dream (that she will likely be poor and have to get a day job) and has chosen to do that then at 21 I think you need to respect that.", "She can\u2019t expect you to support her through this.NTA", "Info: how recently did she leave the military?  Are you only not supporting her interests because its not something YOU want her to do?\n\nYou're not gonna be an asshole for wanting your daughter to have a career but you will be the asshole who doesn't support your own daughter.\n\nBecause she is an adult and the lack of support from a parent is the thing that can and will cause trust issues as well causing rifts in the relationship.", "YTA. Not for giving your 21yo daughter conditions for rent-free accommodation (that's fair enough generally I think), but for the way you talk about your daughters interests and future.\n\nHer whole worth seems to be tied up in earning potential in your mind. What if she told you she'd be happy to earn an average pay packet whilst pursuing her passion? Working in beauty could lead to being a successful business owner - is that not good enough for you?", "I made it absolutely clear from day 1, with my newborn \ud83d\ude1c, that she was expected to become a productive citizen and get off my payroll. I\u2019ve worked hard all my life (since 14) and I spared her that, she was supported all through college and knew that failing wasn\u2019t an option. I love my daughter with all my heart, but at what point do you cut them off? She\u2019s 26 now, and makes more money than I do. I\u2019m super proud of her and non-monetarily supportive of her. I will always be her soft landing, but she\u2019s strong. I have achieved my goal as a parent.", "Honestly YTA.\n\nChildren are people, not property, and you don't get to choose their careers for them. If this is what she wants to do, and you would have given her financial support to get her career going if she chose the path you wanted for her, then you're just being a controlling hypocrite if you won't give her the same support now, because you don't like what she chose.", "NAH. What would you think about giving her a timeline to pursue the actress/influencer interest? It may or may not work out for her but she could give it a solid go and who knows?  Some make it. It may not be what you want her to do but you would support her for a while if she were pursuing engineering or accounting or something. Of course you couldn\u2019t support her indefinitely. You could ask her to get a more steady job to help with bills or whatever. If you support what she wants to do now and it doesn\u2019t work out for her she might go back to school and do something more stable in the future.", " NTA. Poor young woman is not going to like the outcome of this post.\n\nYup - go find your own apartment and make your own way, go to school, or stay here and pay rent. That is a completely reasonable list of options.\n\nIt's hard growing up. Really. I don't blame her for wanting to stay in a childhood state. Just dreaming of what we want to do someday and not working towards today's realities at all. But in most cultures, that part of life ends around 16-20. I don't know anywhere that considers 21 to be a child still.  \n\n\nEdited to remove excess harshness.", "NTA - You are being perfectly resonable. Either she needs to be in school working towards some kind of future or she needs to start supporting herself. Either way she can still work towards being an influencer if she wants but what youre asking of her isnt unresonable.", "NAH.   I can see both sides of this argument.  Yes, your daughter should be able to pursue her dreams, but having something to fall back on is smart.    I don't know that I'd limit it to just STEM-related careers though as some of us just aren't maths people (I always did better on the language portion of exams.)", "NTA - let her pay her own rent if she is that determined to be an actress, a makeup artist, or an \"influencer.\"", "Artist here - YTA.", "YTA.

Because I\u2019m a licensed esthetician, and that\u2019s what I make - working for myself, usually only 4 days a week. I\u2019m able take time off whenever I want, can be at every single school function for my daughter because I control my schedule. I own a business, I got to design and decorate a luxury skin care studio, I go to work and do things I enjoy for clients who appreciate me - life in the beauty industry is awesome and I am SO glad I made this my career. Major caveat though - being successful in this industry, especially quickly, absolutely requires passion, dedication, education, skill and a ridiculous amount of hustle. I worked full time in special education, part-time at a spa and then worked in my own studio at night and on weekends while building a clientele from the ground up. 14 hour days were my norm for over a year and a half before I was able to quit my other two jobs and focus solely on my own business. It takes HARD work.  But the rewards are absolutely there, if you\u2019re willing to work for them. \n\nOne of my buddies from beauty school is a barber. He\u2019s a former Marine and an awesome all around human. He\u2019s incredibly successful and owns a multiple award-winning barbershop and is so beloved by his community I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019d win if he ran for mayor. \n\nI understand your desire for your daughter to have a career and find success and stability. But when it comes to her options in the beauty industry specifically, I think you\u2019re uninformed and making incorrect assumptions. I\u2019m not at all knocking STEM careers or even other \u201cimportant\u201d jobs like those in the medical field. But think about this - quality of life. It\u2019s not just about my income - which I\u2019m quite happy with after only 4 years of licensure and a chunk of those closed by my state due to the pandemic, but it\u2019s more about the quality of life I have and how I am able to manage and limit my stress (important for my health). I don\u2019t have a boss, let alone a boss to be breathing down my neck for things. I don\u2019t have to \u201cask permission\u201d to take time off because my sister comes to town to visit. Getting sick or taking time off for medical procedures isn\u2019t some stressful HR nightmare. Holidays are spent with my family, not working. Can you say the same?", "Cosmetology is a legit career.   She could do a lot with that degree from owning her own salon to working with theaters and movies.", "How about a degree in something that you don't see as \"good prospects.\" How about a trade school in make-up artistry or a bachelors in English?  \n\n\nIs this one of those AITA posts where someone hides important information because they dont' want to look like an AH?   \n\n\nIf you are refusing to help her study in a field that she enjoys, but will support her if she sells her soul and goes into stem just to make you happy, that's an AH move.", "What counts as 'good job aspects' to you? (Also, presume you mean prospects not aspects...)", "What programs do you consider to have good job prospects? Would you think a mechanic makes good money? Plumber? Admin ass't? Or is it really only STEM programs that will/would qualify?", "Pssshhht that is pretty BS then", "Yeah *this* is what makes YTA.", "Then yes, YTA. Military service and work aren\u2019t bad examples to set. Please consider the effect that seeing their sister thrown out for not choosing the career path their parents want might have on them. Do you want them to study to reach a goal or out of fear of abandonment?", "This comment makes YTA. I was fine with NAH until I read your comments.", "Yeah. Like I said it\u2019s fair to ask her to move out. She\u2019s not T A for wanting to do it though.\n\nEdit: by \u201csupport\u201d I mean emotionally support", "Children aren't mooches imo. Even adult children. Why would parents with STEM jobs need their money? They don't. They want to use it to control. \n\nRight now most Gen Alpha kids aren't expected to leave home until they're 29. \n\nBecause the economy is ridiculous.", "She literally juuust got out of the military. She has fallback options for school. Give a kid some time to get her barings and figure her shit out. It goes a long way to feel supported. She seems bright and capable according to OP. What's the problem if she \"wastes\" 6 months on something she believes in?", "Plus there's science involved with that industry. I don't do hair, but my education in beauty taught me more anatomy and physiology on endocrine, skeletal and muscular systems than my nursing degree did", "Counter I know many who went to school for cosmetogy and ended up at random salon and habitually broke.\n\nAll depends on where you are it seems.", "I think I was very clear in my comment and post. She can pursue her interests in her free time if she wants. If she also wants to stay at home, then she needs to study something practical. I'm not hiding anything.", "I corrected the typo, thanks. I don't have a list of such jobs, but a good rule of thumb would be a decent average yearly salary (say at least 60,000$).", "Yup!", "We're from Israel, military service is compulsory for women. I want them to study to have good career options. I don't want my younger daughters to get the impression that we'd support them by making bad decisions for their future.", "It is not about parents needing the money. It is because when you are an adult you make responsible decisions like paying your way. Adult children are eating food, using utilities etc. so why shouldn't they want to contribute towards what they use? Why should parents who have worked hard and raised their kids need to continue providing for them financially when they live at home and are capable of getting a job? It's not about the economy (which I agree is ridiculous) but about being an adult and a decent human being and part of being one is not expecting others to provide for you when you are absolutely capable of providing for yourself", "Oh, absolutely. I\u2019ve learned more about chemistry from dying my own hair than I ever did at school.", "I think what's going on here is the definition of 'practical'. You don't want her to pursue any career that doesn't pay 'enough'. What's enough? What will make you satisfied that your daughter isn't wasting her time?\n\nBeing an influencer is tricky, and I'd say more than half of people who try for it don't succeed. Luck can be a huge factor. However, I have a degree in a field I could make 60k+ in a year, and can't find a job because of a lot of firing/rearranging during Covid; anything could happen in the future. I was also raised by a mother who was a teacher and a dad who--depending on the year and our family--worked at a tampon factory (let him get home when I got out of school), an oil tank driver, a mailman, a janitor, and I'm probably missing a few. None of those required degrees, he sometimes made more than my mother, and I was incredibly proud of them both as a kid. Still am.\n\nTake an afternoon and sit down and define what you actually want for her. If the criteria you put down is 'a degree that will allow you to support yourself without roommates 5 years after graduating' then that's something she may not be able to achieve as a hairstylist but leaves a LOT of options she may actually enjoy. And I'll be blunt: a job you enjoy is worth more than money at a certain point. If my choices were between two jobs I could pay rent/food/utilities on, and one paid double the other but I hated, I'd take the cheaper one just so I didn't hate myself every morning.", "Hair stylists and makeup artists absolutely can make that much. Plus, much less upfront costs to go to cosmetology school than a traditional 4 year college", "Wow so I guess assistant director of annual giving wouldn't make your cut as I only make 55k. Phone-a-thon manager makes 30k where I work.  \n\nAnd yet you rule out cosmetology school which she could use to become an esthetician who makes twice my salary.", "I\u2019m from the US so I get their maybe cultural differences here\u2026my dad is a plumber, great at it and really loves and appreciates his craft. I love and respect him for how hard we works and how happy he is doing that work.\n\nI however, am not of that line of work. I work in the museum world and while it may never pay to the same extent to what he makes, he loved and respected that I wanted to pursue a course of life that makes me happy. I don\u2019t live the life of luxury, but I love my work. I think your attachment to funds=happiness is very very understandable, but you seem to have unplugged the \u201cmy kids should love what they love, not what I love\u201d part of your brain, maybe plug it back in and have a respectful conversation with your daughter. YTA but you can definitely get that revoked if you do better", "She's attempting to build a career for herself after getting out of the military..he just doesn't \"like\" what she is working towards. I would have a whole different take maybe if she was 21 and hadn't done anything since high school, but at this point she's been off serving and probably needs time to recoup and figure some shit out. It's not a terribly unreasonable thing.", "When else in your life do you get to really mess up/explore career options though? Sounds like she's working towards a career he doesn't agree with. It takes time to build a following like it takes time to earn a degree.\n\nShe's got all the years ahead of her to be a \"responsible adult\" I don't get not letting her explore a bit. - an artist who made it"]}
