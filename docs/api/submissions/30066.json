Dan is the founder of the company and hin and I recently started seeing each other but decided not to tell anyone so it doesn't affect work.\n\nThe second co-worker, let's call him Jake.  Jake and Dan are close friends. Jake also has a girlfriend, Jenny.\n\n\nWe had a concert booked in another city and as we are a newer smaller company we are working on lesser than standard market pricing to develop a network. So all of the money that we get gets used in travel and food.\n\nThis time all of us went for the concert. The organisers had informed us that they had already booked our stay.\n\nWe reached the hotel and the receptionist told us that she had booked us a room with two double beds, which is more than enough for 3 people.\n\nJenny called Jake when we had just entered the room to ask how everything was going and he told her that everything is going great and we got a big room.\nJust after that sentence, Jake got up and left the room.\nHe entered the room again and called Dan outside.\n\nI was a little puzzled but didn't think too much of it. \nDan enters the room and tells me that Jake's girlfriend wants me to get another room because she isn't comfortable with me staying in the same room as her boyfriend.\n\n\nDan called Jake inside after he told me what was going on and told Jake that there are two separate beds and it shouldn't be a problem because we are not sleeping in the same bed.\nI felt the same way and told him if it's a huge problem then I'll get an extra mattress and sleep on the floor.\nBut he just refused and said that I needed to get another room because his girlfriend wants me out.\n\n\nI explained to him that it's not just us in the room, Dan is there as well and it shouldn't be such a huge issue.\nHe looked like he didn't want to kick me out but his girlfriend was making him.\n\nHe asked me to get another room and pay for it out of pocket. I told him that it would be unfair and impractical if I did that because we are barely getting any profit out of the gig itself. \n\nHe said that Jenny suggested that I pay it out of my gig pay and that it's the least I can do for my friends.\nI have never met his girlfriend.\n\n\nI got mad at this point and refused to pay out of my pocket for the extra room and told Jake that he can get another room if he's not comfortable and it's not my problem that his girlfriend was being a childish ass. We didn't talk till the shoot started.\n\nHe couldn't pay for the room either, and all of us ended up sleeping in the same room, I slept alone on one bed.\n\n\nMe and Jake are doing okay now. But I do feel like I was a little harsh on him because it didn't seem like he wanted me out of there really it was just his girlfriend.

He wasn't willing to pay the extra money to appease HIS girlfriend - but he expected you to do that? That is some audacity. \n\nThere were two reasonable options here - \n\n* Jake could have asked Dan if the company would cover the cost of a second room because he wasn't comfortable sharing with you. (Because it is the company's responsibility to make sure employees have reasonably comfortable accommodations and expecting someone to share a bed with a colleague, regardless of gender, is unreasonable)\n* Jake could have paid for his own separate room. (Because the only person responsible for ensuring Jake's GF is comfortable with the situation is Jake)\n\nInstead, Jake went for the option that never should have been on the table. It is not your responsibility to ensure Jake's comfort on the trip or his GF's comfort with the arrangements. His ask was out of line.", "NTA\n\nIf Jake/Jenny didn't want him to share a room with you, he should've got another room for himself, not demanded that you get another room and pay for it yourself", "NTA\n\nJakes GF was an AH though.", "NTA. You already had a room, why should you have to get a different room just because someone is being insecure? You came up with an appropriate solution, Jake didn\u2019t want to go along with it, it\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA. If Jenny wanted you to get another room then she can pay for it.", "NTA\n\nThese sleeping arrangements are not ideal for what is a work trip but I understand in small companies, when people are just getting started, that getting the cheapest arrangements (or whatever a contract books for you) is all you can afford/get.\n\nJake should never have even mentioned this issue to you or Dan, let alone ask you to book your own room out of your own money so that HIS gf, who wasn't even there, wouldn't be upset. Jake's behaviour was really unprofessional. If he wanted to appease his gf HE should have booked his own, private room.", "NTA. If Jake\u2019s girlfriend has a problem, then JAKE needs to deal with it. On absolutely no planet is it your responsibility to pay out of pocket for a separate room in order to appease someone else\u2019s girlfriend. What an insane request.", ">Dan is the founder of the company and hin and I recently started seeing each other but decided not to tell anyone so it doesn't affect work.\n\nThis is such a terrible idea. Sleeping with an employee will affect work even if you don't tell anyone.", "NTA\n\nif his GF was upset he should have been the one to get another room. But really she is the one who is the asshole here.", "NTA\n\nThe fact YOU were expected to pay out of pocket for Jakes Gfs problem is insane. Also f Jack for expecting you to pay also!\n\nIf his girlfriend has such a huge problem then he and his gf can foot the bill.\n\nI do think however you need to bring to light You and Dan are dating. Hiding that and it getting exposed will create anger and more drama than people knowing you two are dating. Be mature", "NTA. No one needed to move. And if someone did, it wouldn't have needed to be you, the thing that would have made sense would be that he gets his own room. She was way out of line for demanding you leave and even worse for thinking that you should pay for it.\n\nYour company sucks though - no one should *ever* share a room on business for an employer. If they can't afford everyone to have their own room, then they can't afford to have everyone go. Even if you are a new company. If it's a new company made by Dan, Jake, and you, and you are doing this because you are building your own thing, then OK, but if you are collecting paychecks not dividends, you're being screwed over. Hold on - I reread and see that Dan is the owner and your boyfriend. Yeah, that's a load of crap. Dan should be paying for Jake to have his own room. He's the asshole in the entire thing.", "I mean you're NTA, but that just sounds like an HR claim waiting to happen.", "Dan is the AH here.  \n\nSeriously who books a hotel with 2 beds with 3 people.  Sounds like your BF the owner is just cheap.", "NTA\n\nLet Jenny pay for your room.\n\nSheesh", "Dan is an AH boss. \n\nDan should make another employee share a room with him & his girlfriend. It\u2019s absolutely inappropriate. The company should absolutely be paying for Jake\u2019s room. It\u2019s a business trip.", "NTA. \n\nAs you said, is jakes gf had an issue with it, jake should have got another room", "NTA. This was his issue,  not yours. If he wanted to go with his girlfriend's demand of not sleeping in the same room as you, he needed to get his own room and pay for it, since he was the one with the problem.", "NTA, if she wants you out of the room she could at least have the decency to pay for it, not say you're the one who has to be for it for friendship sake. That would be really unfair that the other 2 have paid accommodation while you have to deal with everything on your own.", "NTA. If she had an issue, she should have paid for it out of her own damn pocket. Expecting you to lose out on money for her feefees is a joke.", "NTA, but this whole situation sounds extremely messy.\n\nAs the person ostensibly in charge, Dan probably should have made this right. It's also not terribly convincing to say \"Dan and I were fine with it,\" when you're in a relationship together and literally make up 2/3 of the business. \n\nI'm a little surprised at some of the comments here - if I went on a company trip and they asked me to room with a woman,  I would expect the company to make it right.", "NTA in any way. SHE or her boyfriend would need to pay to keep her happy. Ugh!", "ESH him for making unreasonable demands on behalf of his GF, you (and your boss / bf) for fishing in the company pool and creating situations that are for sure going to get your business in legal trouble.", "NTA - ye have a Yoko in your midst.", "YTA. Calling Jake\u2019s gf a \u201cchildish ass\u201d is pretty juvenile in itself. You said you didn\u2019t tell Jake you and Dan are hooking up. So of course she\u2019s going to not feel comfortable her bf is sleeping in a hotel room with two beds, two guys and one girl. I feel bad for the gf. You have no respect for her feelings, couldn\u2019t care less what she thinks, and dissed her to her bf. Poor Jake, what a lousy position you put him in.
