You're motivated by love for your sister and not wanting to see her abused, and at the same time by trying to have healthy boundaries with someone who is ping-ponging between taking your support and rejecting it. \"You are dead to me\" isn't the way to express that. The way to express that is \"I want to be here for you, but so long as you are with Lucas, I can't, so I don't want any contact with you until you're ready to be done with him for good.\"\n\nBut, again, you are NTA for cutting contact. That sounds like it needed to happen.", "Nta. She said you weren't even family basically right? So be it.", "NTA.\n\nPlease understand this, though. Abusive relationships are processed in the brain in the exact same way as a drug addiction. When somebody is on drugs (I'll use heroin as an example) they inject the drug, get the dopamine hit, feel great, and then BLAM, all the feel-good chemicals leave their body and they get sick. They feel horrible. So, what do they do? Shoot up again to feel good again.\n\nIn an abusive relationship, where love is being withheld, when you do get hit with that love, that's the injection. That's the dopamine hit. Shit gets bad, that's the sickness. It causes the person to \"chase the high\" again. Any little glimpse of care, like Lucas bringing her crocs, provides relief from the lack of dopamine. \n\nThat's why people act like irrational assholes when they're in an abusive relationship. It is literally an addiction. It's damn near a drug. And hey, addicts get cut off from people for their behavior, too. And just like an addict, they won't change unless THEYRE ready. No amount of pleading, coaxing, begging, and bargaining will get your sister out of the cycle. SHE has to be ready. Not saying all this to make you feel bad, just thought it might be a useful perspective.", "I've been in this boat with my sister and it took a lot longer for me to cut her off. It's for your own sanity. Don't feel bad and you're nta.", "Nta, but your sister is ok with that guy, and she is 19.\n\nIf she wants to be with someone like that, just say cool and carry on, nothing you do will make her not want to be with that guy", "NTA, but I think you are over reacting slightly.\n\nDead to me, implies permanent, I think you'd protect yourself just as well by going NC instead until she gets herself figured out.\n\nIn a few years I'm sure things will be different.  Maybe better or worse, but it at least leaves the door open.", "NTA - OP has bent over backwards to save someone who clearly doesn\u2019t want to be saved.   It\u2019s a no-win situation.   Booting you from the hospital was an AH move and I don\u2019t blame you for your anger with your sister.   But keep the door open so she has support when she is strong enough to leave her abuser.   Hopefully it will stick next time.", "NTA. Just because someone's blood related to you does not mean they get to treat you like utter trash, use and abuse you and then expect everything to be OK. And I'm not saying go no contact, but you don't need to go out of your way to help her out of situations, that she creates her self, and if anyone disagrees with you, they can go help her.", "NTA \n\nYou tried and tried. Until she is ready to make a different choice in life, she will always get the same results. Nothing will change until she wants to commit to that change no matter the cost or how hard it will be", "NTA.  But if you're going to say it, you better mean it.  Otherwise, you're just another drama queen like your sister.  Well, maybe not quite like your sister who is a little princess wannabe that seems to think everyone is at her beck and call except for \"Lucas\" who she is perfectly willing to be the lapdog for.", "Gentle ESH\n\nYour sister is almost definitely in an abusive relationship. On average, it takes domestic abuse victims SEVEN tries before they finally leave for good. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t mistreat you or be so back and forth, but that is what abusers do. They make you isolate yourself from your family and they gaslight their victims into thinking that they\u2019re the only one who loves and cares for them. Your sisters actions don\u2019t make sense because she\u2019s likely not in total control of her life right now. \n\nHer actions clearly suck, but she\u2019s clearly going through it right now. I know it\u2019s hard to watch and be around, so it\u2019s okay to take space.

An abuser works very hard to isolate his victim from any support network, esp family. By giving up on your sister, you\u2019re telling her she can\u2019t count on you if she finally does escape her abuser.\n\nI get that you\u2019re upset and frustrated, but your sister is in a terrible situation. She needs to know that you\u2019re there if she needs you\u2014because one day, hopefully, she will.\n\nSince you\u2019re asking specifically if you\u2019re an asshole for saying she\u2019s dead to you, I\u2019m gonna say YTA. But on the overall situation I think N A H.", "They way is going with your sister and her abusive relationship and the chance of her being deas for real is not far off. So, I guess you are right? \nBut I am not going to judge you here, I know it is must be hard  for you.", "NTA,  your feeling where hurt, you put alot of effort into a one sided relationship. You will be better off without her, for now. She'll mature hopefully and you can pick up a relationship in the future.", "ESH\n\nAs someone who is estranged from his family, seems a bit over the top since she's in an abusive relationship. She has been beyond an asshole, but you're judging her as if she's in a healthy mindstate. Protect yourself and go no contact if you need to, but the punishment of never talking to her again doesn't fit the crime imo.", "ESH I don't know if she deserves being \"dead to you\" going through the throes of an abusive on and off relationship lol. But she certainly doesn't treat you well either.", "ESH. \n\nYou deserve to be respected and I know how shitty it is to watch someone stay in an unhealthy relationship. Like others have said, your sister is in a bad place and not fully able to make healthy choices as she's in an abusive relationship. I also wonder if there are bigger mental health challenges like bipolar or something (I'm not a doctor).\n\nBut also phrasing like \"she's dead to me\" isn't exactly mature? Like who is it you're saying that to? Her? Not ideal and not a great way to encourage her to respect you. Your friends? Sounds like you like drama. You're allowed to be upset for sure, but don't go posting it all over FB for your mutual friends or anything (not saying you're doing that, but I don't have enough context here). \n\nJust tell her no next time she asks for help.", "NAH, while it really hurts your sister is in an abusive relationship and all you can do is be thier when she is ready to leave, but don't keep running to her,  sometimes you have to hit rock bottom before you realise your in a hole", "YTA for framing it as \"shes dead to me for making me second option when i always made her a priority\" - this isn't about you.\n\nShe's in an abusive relationship, her mind isn't right. And now you've removed one of her places to go when she needs to be safe. I hope she's ok.", "In one hand I understand your view on saying \u201cshe is dead to me\u201d. In the other hand, the words \u201cdead\u201d itself means too much.\nI am leaning to (soft) YTA for the death words but NTA for the intention. I get it (cmiw) that the \u201cdead\u201d means that you won\u2019t help her easily again, not prioritizing her anymore, and draw the line.\nIt is an okay decision and I vouch for that too, as sounds like she is using your kindness for granted.\nWithout her in your prioritization list, you have one less problem.", "NTA.  You need to add an edit to this post that explains why you are choosing to say your sister is dead to you. \n\nAfter reading your explanation I can understand why you are at this point. I will disagree with anyone who says Y T A or E S H. You have tried to be so supportive and your sister is at times frankly using you. Your sister has broken so many boundaries for you. Yes she is in an abusive relationship but she cannot treat you that way. I agree that you need to start putting yourself first which may look like going NC. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love her or wish her harm. You are putting yourself self first and that is ok. You have clearly tried to be supportive, and there\u2019s only so much anyone can do.", "Soft YTA. The result was too extreme for the offense. I can see you stepping back and waiting until she matures enough to know better (19 is still in the young and stupid range) but permanently cutting her out? Too much.", "YTA. Because a sister is there when she finally realizes she needs help. It takes some women a long time. Other\u2019s die.", "Soft TA - Relationship abuse is very hard to watch and if you're one in the relationship, it can take years to see it yourself. TA  when you say she's dead to you, but NTA to draw a line and not save her any longer. In my experience, I was able to take my abused friend for coffee, we would text, but I would not talk about her abuse or go rescue her. She had to figure it out. 2 years later she is not going with that person any longer and has made huge progress in her life. You can still love your sister without the drama and in the long run I'm sure she will value your relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
