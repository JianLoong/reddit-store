{"id": 31452, "submission_id": "180od3q", "title": "WIBTA for not wanting a joint baby shower", "selftext": "I (25f) am 23 weeks pregnant. My entire life I have been told it would be extremely difficult for me to get pregnant due to some medical issues that I have. Be that as it may my IUD fell out without me noticing, and I got pregnant within 2 weeks of that happening. I'm ecstatic and scared to have this baby. \n\nThe problem begins because my SIL (35f) is 20 weeks pregnant with a rainbow baby. They had a rough miscarriage at 10 weeks last year, and seemed to really struggle with it. The day we told my SO's family that we were pregnant it has been nothing except being compared to her pregnancy. Being told how hard it was for them with her previous miscarriage, and honestly it really scared me hearing all the things that could go wrong with a pregnancy. \n\nMy SIL is an extremely shy woman, and honestly I'm not sure if she has said a single word to me any of the 3 times we have been in a room together. I've tried my best to not let it bother me as I'm sure it's nothing to do with me specifically but rather her social anxiety. This means though that when my MIL said we had to have a joint baby shower because of how close together we are that I wasn't sure it was a good idea. For one we just simply don't know each other pretty much at all. Secondly this is my first baby and potentially my last as my doctors were shocked I got pregnant in the first place. This is her 4th child, but first with BIL who doesn't have any children other than the step-children who are absolutely adorable if a little bit wild children. Not to say she shouldn't have a baby shower, I think she and BIL should be celebrated, but not at the same time as mine. \n\nMy MIL is really insistent that either I do the joint baby shower, or don't have one at all. I know that the vast majority of the family is going through significant financial difficulties, and I 100% do not expect them to go out of their way to hold a huge party or give gifts at all. I've said this multiple times. I just want a little get together with some food(I am very willing to supply the food and venue) and nice things to be said about my unborn child. But my MIL says that as they are going to be so close I should expect everything to happen together. This includes future birthdays which I will have to put my foot down about because both children deserve to have their own special day. \n\nI'm worried I am being selfish about this. I just want some time to celebrate my own little accomplishment, but maybe it would be easier to have it together with their family, and have a different one with just my own mother and brother. It just feels so cosmically unfair to me that it happened to be almost the same time, and its making me just not want to have one at all. I also worry about how SIL might feel overshadowed too, but maybe all that attention would be too much on her. I just don't know what to do here at this point and I feel lost.", "created_utc": 1700592914, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180od3q/wibta_for_not_wanting_a_joint_baby_shower/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My SIL also struggles with social anxiety so a day only for her might be too much. My MIL has also said that I'm being TA because my pregnancy is just as important as SIL's, and that I don't need special attention just because I have medical problems. I think she might be right because I haven't had a miscarriage nor do I have social anxiety so I might be making things way harder on SIL who has just because I want attention for my own thing.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would like to celebrate my pregnancy that I never thought would happen and I'm sure SIL feels the same.\"", "Absolutely NTA, \"Mil, not sure where you got the notion that I \"have\" to do anything, I do not.  I wouldn't have made such an issue of this but you mentioned joint birthdays and I think you need to know from the beginning that there will be no joint shower, no joint birthdays and no telling me what I \"have\" to do.  This isn't up for discussion either\". \n\nThis is absolutely the hill to die on or you and your child will come second forever and birthdays will be on sil child's birthday, in the venue they choose.", "NTA is she expecting you to share a stroller with a total stranger or something? Why would you _have_ to have them together?", "NTA\n\nINFO\n\nDoes your SO have any opinions on this situation? Can they not back you up and stand up to the MIL...", "NTA\n\nBest way to cut this off ASAP is to inform her that a family member on your side (maybe your mother?) or a friend is organizing a shower just for you and she can keep an eye on her mailbox for an invite. Just exclude her from it completely.\n\nEven better, if your mom or your friend are strong willed, whenever your MIL presses you about this, redirect to the relative/friend organizing your shower, and they can shut her down.\n\nYou need to stand up for yourself in a polite but firm way. Since baby showers are typically thrown FOR an expecting mother rather than BY one, this is all just easier if you put someone else in charge of your party.", "NTA. I also really like what you said about putting your foot down about birthday's. My older brother started dating this girl about 10 years ago whose birthday is also in the same month as mine just like 10 days apart and up until I moved out they always made it some joint party without even asking. It's mad frustrating.", "NTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to share this with her. If you really want to people please, you could always have a little shower with just that part of your family that overlaps, and then have your real shower with the other people in your life separately. I mean, if it\u2019s her 4th kid, she probably wouldn\u2019t really be having much of a shower anyways? \n\nMake an excuse that your mom/sister/friend had already started planning one for you and it would be weird to combine since they don\u2019t know SIL.", "NTA and thank you for putting your foot down about the kid birthdays.\n\nI had to share mine with my sister every year growing up and this year at 32 I noped off and spent the day with just my husband doing whatever random things i wanted to do. Best birthday ever.\n\nFeeling special matters to people.", "NTA but if you don\u2019t want a joint baby shower, you need to plan and pay for it yourself or have a friend or family member of yours do it. Even if all you want is a small celebration, that can be expensive and time consuming to plan. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to ask your MIL to plan two showers back to back. If you do decide to have the baby shower on your own, find out what date your SIL\u2019s shower will be and try to avoid scheduling yours on the same weekend.", "NTA\n\nINFO\n\nDoes your SO have any opinions on this situation? Can they not back you up and stand up to the MIL...", "NTA.\n\nJust do your own thing with your family and friends. When MIL complains, that's when you put your foot down. Tell her your child will be celebrated as an individual and you will not be doing joint celebrations for them as every child deserves their own special day. If she doesn't like it, too damn bad, it's not about her and the way she feels.", "NTA. Why do women always let other people decide their lives for them? I just don't get it.\n\nJust tell your MIL to fuck off.", "NTA. Where is your husband in all this? Why isn't he reigning in his mother? \n\nCut this in the bud...NOW. If you want a baby shower, ask a friend or a member of YOUR family to host it. That way MIL has no say or control over the event. Heck, you could do all the organizing and funding in the background, just find a trusted friend or family member to act as the host (had to do that once or twice in the past). \n\nAs far as birthday parties are concerned, set the tone right now that your child will celebrate their birthdays and accomplishments the way you/they want to. That there will be no joint anything unless that is what they want. \n\nYour SIL's issues are hers and hers alone to manage. You should not have to play second fiddle to her. Ok, she's got social anxiety and she's painfully shy. Doesn't mean you can't live your life the way you want to. \n\nShe's had 3 chances at having a baby shower already, this may be your one shot. You deserve it. Hold fast and stand firm.", "INFO: You say you aren't expecting gifts, can you call your party something else besides a baby shower if you aren't planning on people giving gifts? \n\nIt's not your MIL's choice on how you celebrate. Let them pick a date for their shower, then plan one of your own on a different date.", "Fourth child as a rule don't get showers (I understand this may differ regionally, but that's the rule I had been taught).\n\nYou are entirely entitled to a shower, but don't you have a friend who could host it for you? I have had friends who had 3 or 4 showers because work shower, college friends shower, family shower can all happen.\n\nIt is entirely wrong of your MIL to make it out that you are having a two-for-one event.

When they\u2019re twins. My twin and I are used to having joint birthday celebrations. I would probably feel very strange to not share my birthday with someone. Our little brother\u2019s birthday is less than a week after ours. Every year we get a cake with all three names and that\u2019s just normal for us. \n\nYou know what\u2019s not normal?
