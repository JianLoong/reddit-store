I opened up the changing table and it was genuinely disgusting. I\u2019m pretty sure there was baby poop on it!! I couldn\u2019t even tell what else was on it. \n\nI have a diaper bag that turns into a portable changing table in the back section and it\u2019s pretty easy and quick to set up, so I went into the accessible stall and changed him as quickly as I could. \n\nAs we were leaving the restroom, an older woman approaches us and very rudely tells me not to use the accessible restroom to change a baby ever, and that because I used it she had to use a regular stall and those make her legs hurt. I said I was sorry and she called me an a-hole and told me I needed to learn common sense. \n\nMy husband agrees with me, but I told a friend about this and she told me I was a jerk.

Unlike parking places that require a placard, it\u2019s well established that the handicap stalls in bathrooms are for anyone\u2019s use if available. Obviously you should try to use the smaller stalls if you\u2019re able first, but you had the need for the larger space in the handicap stall. If she truly was unable to use the regular stall, she needs to wait", "This is wild; I can't believe so many are calling you the asshole.

You went as fast as you could, and you needed the space, that\u2019s good enough for me. I hate people who act like you can\u2019t need the stalls for several reasons and must only use If in a wheelchair. I have back and leg damage and I need the bars, but I get yelled at a lot cuz I\u2019m only 23 and can\u2019t possibly need it.

Often times the ADA stall is the one with the changing table in it. Also, there are a variety of reasons people might need the larger stall.

You're good, Mama.", "NTA what an entitled boomer. The handicapped stall isn\u2019t so that people with disabilities never have to wait. It\u2019s just the stall configured for disabled to use.

How did she know you were even using the changing table and not just using the actual restroom?  Plus I'd argue using the restroom holding a baby IS a handicap.. (lol)  \n\n\nBut seriously, if the baby needs a diaper change, that is the baby version of using the restroom.  If the restroom's only baby changing station (so let's just say baby toilet) is located inside the handicap stall, then the handicap stall is the APPROPRIATE location for baby to get changed.  Anyone else who also needs to appropriately use that stall, can wait.  it is a public stall, and it's for first come first serve use.  You did nothing wrong, and I'm sorry this woman approached you so rudely out of selfishness.  Worry about your baby and what's good for YOUR BABY.  That woman is a grown ass woman and can take care of herself.", "Wtf. NTA. Just because the stall is accessible doesn't mean it has to be always available. She's old enough to know how to wait.

Just an entitled old lady, don't worry about it.", "NTA- as the mother of a wheelchair using child, I\u2019m more annoyed when people park in the van accessible handicap spots that don\u2019t need them,  than I would be with a mother using the handicap stall in the bathroom to change a baby.

You needed it to change your baby safely NTA grandma can go take her potty breaks at home if she's gonna be so rude.", "NTA accessible stalls are not like the parking spaces, anyone and everyone has the right to use them. \n\nFrequently baby changing stations will be available in accessibility stalls, which I prefer it makes me uncomfortable to change my newborn and toddler in front of randos when the changing station is in the middle of the restroom/right by the restroom door.\n\nTbh if you really want to be technical about it a baby/toddler can not change themselves without assistance. They are not physically capable of doing that and require assistance from someone who is physically capable.

Also, what if you were the one who needed the facilities? I've been out many times with my baby and had to go myself. You have to take the stroller in with you.

You could also be a parent with a disability of your own who maybe needs the extra room or handle bars to sit down.", "NTA. Handicap accessible is not the same as handicap exclusive (ie. parking spots) It\u2019s not like you were just standing in there doing nothing. Ofc you should always use the other stalls first when it\u2019s just you but I\u2019ve seen plenty of mothers go for the handicap stall solely to keep their stroller with them when they go.", "NTA - the handicapped stall is not reserved for handicapped users - like a handicapped parking space - it means one stall is equipped for them to use.  It sounds like this old woman just wanted to sound off.", "\nNTA \n\nI use the disabled toilet to take my 3 year old in, as baby change rooms rarely (if ever) have toilets.

Don't listen to that selfish lady!", "NTA. Despite being called a handicapped stall, that stall really exists for accessibility for anyone who is incapable of using a normal one.

What were you supposed to do, spready out your changing mat inside of a regular sized stall? I can't imagine you took that awfully long.

The elderly are not the only ones who use it.", "NTA - when you think about it babies are living with a significant handicap, more so than the vast majority of disabled adults.

If it was that big of a deal, she could have waited just a couple minutes. What if someone else who needed the bar was using the stall? Would she have called them an asshole too because it wasn\u2019t immediately available? It\u2019s not like you set up camp in there for an hour. You quickly changed your baby. Yes people should always use the smaller stalls first if they are able to but that wasn\u2019t the case for you. A huge majority of the time the handicapped accessible bathrooms are also considered family bathrooms with a changing table regardless, at least around here. \n\nTbh this is why I use the trunk of my car over public bathrooms half the time but no one should have to change their baby on a poop covered table so NTA x a million.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m sorry that you feel that you can only take your baby with you because he is very calm.

This happened to me long ago at Target, except I had a cart full of purchased items, my baby in a baby Bjorn and toddler in the cart seat. The single family bathroom was occupied. My toddler had to go so I used the large stall in the regular bathroom and took cart and all into the stall. When we came out we met the scowl of an elderly lady pushing a wheel chair with a similar aged woman in the seat. The woman pushing the wheelchair gave me a piece of her mind and I responded with sorry, it couldn\u2019t be helped. The lady sitting in the wheelchair said: \u201cshe has her babies with her, she couldn\u2019t leave them outside the stall.\u201d I thanked her quietly, washed up and left.
