We met in undergrad and have been seriously dating through grad school. I\u2019ve finished my masters and he is almost done. We each have our own apartments, where we sleep over together multiple times per week. \n\nMy Dad\u2019s (57m) extended family has a beach house a few hours from where we live. I grew up going there for vacation over the summer, and it\u2019s been common for friends and/or significant others of family members to join us. My very religious grandma (who passed away years ago; my aunt owns the house now) had a \u2018rule\u2019 that couples had to sleep in separate rooms, no matter their age, until they were married. My Mom (59f) - who has since divorced my Dad - was subject to this rule as they dated in her late 20s and early 30s. \n\nSo, the plan for July 4th was for Dad, my sisters (18f and 20f), my partner and I to go to the beach for a few days. Dad tried to enforce the \u2018separate beds\u2019 rule, justifying that my partner and I are not married. I countered, saying it implies my partner and I are sl*ts, that he can\u2019t control our relationship like that, and that it makes no logical sense seeing as that we already sleep together in our apartments and my Mom\u2019s house. He held his ground and said that was the rule until I got married, no matter who I was with. This, to me, is homophobic (or at least grossly heteronormative). What if we don\u2019t ever (or legally can\u2019t) get married? Will I have to sleep in a separate room in my 40s? He said yes. \n\nI bailed on the vacation and chose to spend the 4th with my partner and his family at their house. My Mom agrees, saying she felt so disrespected when they made her sleep separately in her 30s. My sisters were understandably disappointed but ultimately took my side. My Dad and I are not on speaking terms. AITA?\n\nEdit1: To clarify, the rule isn\u2019t inherently homophobic. But the threshold of sharing a bed being marriage is heteronormative\u2014 the gay community does not have the same history or relationship with marriage.

However, OP claiming homophobia for this really make him an asshole when it applies to all couples equally and really pushes the accusation on his dad .  Can definitely understand why your dad annoyed at you. \n\nIf you and your partner had been together for 5-7 years and were in your last twenties and yes whatever legal marriage reason , your dad might have waived it off. But you pushed it far and likely your dad stood firm so as not to discriminate anyone especially if in the future your sisters bring their bfs.\n\nEdit: Also wanted to add for OP, the house and rule was created by his grandmother than passed away, it\u2019s likely his Dad is keeping it as part of the memory for his mum.", "ESH.  First, it's not homophobic unless he allows straight unwed couples to share a bed, and it sounds like he doesn't.

You may not like the rule - but it doesn't sound like this was new by any means. \n\nI'm engaged to my fianc\u00e9 - if I'm at her parents house and they say we can't sleep in the same bed until we're married - that's the rule in that house. Hypotheticals, fairness, etc don't have anything to do with this. Living together and sharing a bed elsewhere is irrelevant.\n\nYou're in the right to leave, go to a different location, etc.  But parents not wanting unmarried couples sharing a bed is a pretty standard thing. Even moreso for straight couples bc of pregnancy - do your dad is treating you pretty equally imo.\n\nQuestion for op: if you live together or sleep together regularly anyway - what's the big deal being in separate bedrooms for 1 night?", "I think it's best if you stay where you're most comfortable and feel the most welcome, OP.

Don't listen to the presumably straight and, sorry, ignorant commenters here trying to label you an AH for stating so. Your edit is bang-on in the sense that queer people have a *very* different relationship to marriage as straight people do. You could have a life partner for decades and never marry, which would be very normal in the queer community, and under your father's rules you'd never be able to share a bed in that house even if you'd been together 30 years.\n\nMarriage is not the only way to conduct a loving, fulfilling, devoted, monogamous, lifelong partnership (and even if your partnership is non-monogamous that doesn't somehow invalidate it). You are also correct that marriage for non-straight people is very much NOT a settled right - what with the Supreme Court we have now it could very well be in danger in the near term. If your father is willing to discriminate against your life partnership just because the government says y'all can't get married because you have the same genitalia, how is that NOT homophobic?\n\nAgain, NTA and I would've done the same in your shoes.", "YTA His rules, his house.

It\u2019s so damn stupid to ban a long term couple from sharing a bedroom. \u201cDad you do understand that we can fuck anywhere and not just a bedroom right? Grandma is dead and if you want me and my partner to go on vacation with you we will no longer subject ourselves to her archaic irrelevant rules.

These are the conditions of the household. You and I might disagree with them, but that's the offer. You don't like them, and therefore chose other plans. That all seems fine.
