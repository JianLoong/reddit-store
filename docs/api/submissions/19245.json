I don\u2019t know why you wouldn\u2019t just explain to your child that not all women have kids. Some by choice and some through no choice of their own, and since we don\u2019t always know if it might be an upsetting reason, we don\u2019t put people on the spot and ask them casually.\n\nTo be clear- You said you were being vague- so I have no idea if that means you had the above conversation or just said \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and tried to change the subject. I\u2019m basing my judgement on the latter.", "Yeah, YTA, sorry- Your daughter is 13, she should know by now what boundaries are. That was really rude, especially since she kept at it. You should have told your daughter not all women have children for various reasons and it's nobodies business as to why, it's not something you ask about.", "INFO: You told your daughter not to bring up the topic because it may upset your aunt and she did it anyway, then lied and said you already told her the reason why.  Sounds like your daughter was disrespectful to you and her aunt.   Do you plan on addressing that?", "Yes you're the AH. You should have told your daughter that it's rude to ask these type of question and how to mind her own business! I'd expect these kind of questions from a 5 year old instead of a 13 years old. 13 is old enough to know better.", "YTA seriously, be a parent! How hard is it to say - there are a lot of reasons people don\u2019t or can\u2019t have children. It is generally rude to ask why. Even if she is your aunt, Do not ask her why because if it is private or painful reason, you will hurt her.  \n\nYou totally failed here. This kind of passive \u201cparenting\u201d if you can even call it that drives me nuts.", "Slight YTA\n\nYour daughter is old enough to ask these questions. So she is also old enough to learn that people are allowed to keep private information private.\n\nYou did great up to the point where you said you didn\u2019t know why L didn\u2019t have children. \n\nThis is where you can teach your daughter a valuable lesson.\n\n\u201c I don\u2019t know why L doesn\u2019t have children. I would never ask her such a personal question. There are many reasons why people can\u2019t or don\u2019t have kids, and some of the reasons can be painful. If L wants me to know why she doesn\u2019t have children, she will tell me. \n\n\u201c Sometimes, we really want to know something. But when that something involves another person, we have to let that person keep their private matters private. Yes, we want to know. But we have no right to know. Sometimes, we don\u2019t get the answers we want. \n\n\u201cSometimes, we are faced with questions that will never be answered. And we just have to accept that and move on. \n\n\u201cAlways, before asking someone a personal question, you need to ask yourself, do your really need this information or do you just want this information. You don\u2019t need to know why Auntie L doesn\u2019t have kids, you just want to know. And that means you don\u2019t ask.\u201d", "I know there\u2019s a lot of NTAs going on in here\u2026but, you\u2019re a little bit AH for not explaining to your 13 y.o. WHY this is inappropriate.\n\nYou telling your daughter to be respectful in not bringing up Auntie\u2019s fertility issues would\u2019ve made a lot more sense to the kid if she understood it was for a very painful reason. She\u2019s old enough to feel empathy.", "YTA and so is your daughter.  This was an opportunity for you to teach your daughter that \"nice people\" don't have to have children and that asking people personal questions is rude.", "YTA, there are age appropriate ways to discuss this with children. This is obviously a soft spot for your sister. Your daughter should learn basic manners that it\u2019s disrespectful to ask anyone about their status as childless/child free/when are you having more. If more people did this we\u2019d have less asshole adults.", "YTA. You could have explained the medical side of it to your daughter. I am unable to have children of my own, yes it hurts but it also hurts for my family to act awkward around me because of it. Like you are doing to her.", "YTA.\n\n\"That's a very personal subject and it's rude to ask someone that\" was all you had to say instead of being deliberately vague.  You absolutely could have and should have prevented this.", "YTA. Per your title.   Yes, you should have stopped her.  Your daughter really needs to learn to mind her own business.  Your SIL tried to answer vaguely but she pushed.  She also said before the dinner she planned on asking, sounds like multiple times per your rinse and repeat.  You should have totally shut her down\u2026hard. \n\nYour daughter is WAY TOO OLD to be acting like a 7 year old who can\u2019t understand. \n\nI get that you tried to not disclose a confidence.   But, you could have said, there is an actual reason, that\u2019s not my place to say, so please rest assured you do not need to ask her why.", "Yes,  YTA. You can't tell a prying 13 yr old \"I don't know\" and then,  \"don't ask! She might get upset.\" This is 100% your fault.  You made it a thing.  \nInfertility is fairly common these days,  coupled with the fact that you said SIL has always been fine with kids, I don't know why you even think she'd be upset.  You could have been honest with your daughter.  'I've been told she can't,  and I imagine that makes her sad so we don't ask bc we don't want to hurt her feelings.' Or you could have been vague.  'That's a very personal question. Just like we don't ask people about their finances,  that's not really something you ask people sweetie. It's considered very rude.' \nThis is 100% on you.", "YTA. \"Not all woman have children.\"  Period. End of story. That's exactly what you say.  And if she continues to ask, 13 is a reasonable age to be told to knock it off and stop making her aunt uncomfortable.", "When my kids started asking why my brother and SIL didn't have kids, I told them not everyone can and that it's none of their business anyway.  I also said that if they brought it up, they would be in trouble.  Even if you didn't want to say anything about infertility, you could have said it's none of your business, and if you bring it up, you'll be in trouble. Yta", "I am not sure what judgement to give, but your daughter, at 13, is old enough to know you do not ask people about their bodies or kids/choices around kids without an invitation to do so.\n\nGranted at 13 is also old enough ti do so anyway/push the boundaries of manners, but then consequences, line grounding or loss of privileges, seem fair.", "Yta\n\nHow hard is it to sit down and explain to your daughter that asking such personal questions can be super hurtful?? Do you want to raise someone without empathy? Cause you\u2019re in your way there. Yes teenagers are aholes but that\u2019s why they have parents to sit them down, and explain things in detail, to list all of the things that could be wrong with aunt and why it would hurt. And for you to help her relate to it.", "Not necessarily TA, but it could have been handled better. 13 is old enough to understand the base medical explanation and to know that some topics aren\u2019t polite to bring up as they can be painful. If she was that insistent you could have explained the reason and asked her not to bring it up as it would be painful for her aunt. Would have avoided any drama.", "I went through infertility for years. When my niece asked me why I didn't have kids I told her, \"Just because you want something, doesn't mean it'll happen.\" She understood that I did want kids, but sometimes it doesn't happen just because you want it. Your daughter is 13 she is old enough to know about sex education. Sit her down and explain sex to her (if you haven't already) that a lot of things can go wrong or just not happen. Also explain to her that her aunt would love to have children, but hasn't been able to and it's the cause of a lot of pain, so that is why you don't want her asking about it. When she sees her aunt and uncle, she can give them big hugs if she would like to and tell them she loves them. Communication solves a lot of hurt feelings.", "YTA.  A big one.  Why didn\u2019t you teach your daughter better?", "Esh except the Sil.  Your daughter is 13 not 3, she is darn old enogh to not ask a question that she has been told will upset someone. \n \nNext time its time form a visit, \n'You're not coming to Aunties bc you purposefully asked a question that i told you not to ask and upset her'  and then hire a babysitter.", "Your daughter is TA.", "YTA But softly \n\nUnfortunately your daughter doesn\u2019t seem to have learnt any manners. Despite you telling her not to ask, she still went and did it. And she\u2019s 13! She should know better. \n\nYou did your best to handle the situation, whilst trying to maintain someone\u2019s privacy. But it still didn\u2019t work out well.", "YTA\n\nYour teen came to you for advice. Instead of clearly outlining the situation, and how rude it will be to ask directly, you permitted a gap of understanding to ferment in your teens brain.\n\nDoesn\u2019t your teen think the family who\u2019s been around longer than she has realize the aunt has fertility issues? \n\nOn what planet is it ok for you to coyly suggest your teen should be able to ask, as if this was a family secret that needed to be asked in public by someone brave enough to ask?\n\nYou should have been a parent. Instead you behaved like a HIPPA specialist afraid to be sued.", "YTA. When your daughter started asking, you needed to give her an answer. If you don't want to break a confidence, go to L (or have your husband, her brother, do so, or even via your MIL) and ask HER what she wants your daughter to know. Especially as your daughter kept bringing it up.", "YTA \n\nWhy didn\u2019t you tell your daughter the truth? That maybe she doesn\u2019t want them, or maybe she actually can\u2019t have them and that it\u2019s a sensitive topic to bring up? And that she may hurt her aunts feelings by asking?", "Soft YTA\n\nIt's your role as a parent to teach your daughter not to be rude. And she doesn't have to know the reason why your SIL can't have children since your SIL want to keep it private.\n\n13 yo should know that being nosy is rude and you're not entitled to everyone's private informations, including family.", "YTA - would have been an excellent time to have a discussion with your daughter about children: the incorrect assumption that all women want them or the fact that some people struggle to conceive or choose not to due to hereditary illness.\nYou didn\u2019t have to get in to graphic specifics and could keep it PG13 but just enough to educate her, before making it clear that it\u2019s incredibly rude to ask someone why they don\u2019t have children. And that it\u2019s always for the person without children to initiate any discussion about why they don\u2019t have kids.  None of this would be betraying a confidence as you aren\u2019t confirming anything about your aunt.\n\nIf you\u2019d dealt with it head on, instead of dancing around the subject would have saved a lot of drama and the obvious hurt that has been caused to your Aunt", "YTA. You peeked her interest by avoiding her questions. All you really needed to say was not everyone wants or chooses to have children and families look like different things to different people. Then if she pushed it explain how asking such personal questions is rude, etc.", "My cousin in her 40's doesn't have kids and my MIL keeps asking me why. I told her that not everyone wants children and it's her (my cousins) business and not the worlds.", "YTA.\n\nYou could have answered honestly without breaking confidence: that you didn\u2019t know for certain but there\u2019s lots of reasons someone doesn\u2019t have children, whether it\u2019s their choice or due to infertility. It can be a very sensitive subject for people and asking them directly could cause someone pain. It\u2019s also not anyone\u2019s business, and is a good example of who just because you are interested in information doesn\u2019t mean you are entitled to it.", "NTA but your daughter was acting like one. Also tactless. As her mom you should have told her that there are things inappropriate to ask other people such as their age, income, personal choices such as getting married/having kids, sexuality, someone\u2019s appearance (ie weight, height), etc.\n\nDepending on your relationship with your sister, you can call her up, apologize and explain that you just did not know what to tell your daughter and also tell her how you\u2019re going to do better.", "Unsure why you did not tell the truth to your daughter, in words she could process given her age?", "Nta. Teenagers are a holes. 13 is old enough to know manners and discretion and NOT everything is her business despite wanting to know. I hope there are some repercussions to her for her blatant rudeness.", "NTA not much you could have done. But at 13, your daughter is old enough to know better. You told jer not to ask, stating it would upset her aunt. She chose to do it anyway. \n\nShe needs a stern talking to, about boundaries and respecting people's privacy.", "YTA. You should have explained to your daughter that asking people why they don\u2019t have children is rude and invasive, and explained more generally that it can be for a whole host of reasons, including infertility or other medical issues, and made it very clear that it was none of her business. \n\nYour daughter is definitely old enough to know better and learn basic respect and manners, as well as some life lessons that nobody \u201chas to\u201d have kids.", "YTA. If someone isn\u2019t volunteering info or bringing it up, it is not appropriate. It\u2019s no one\u2019s business if it\u2019s fertility issues or simply because she doesn\u2019t want to, it\u2019s an inappropriate question and that\u2019s what you should have told your daughter both in private and then publicly when she did bring it up. She\u2019s not a tiny child who doesn\u2019t know better, she\u2019s a teenager.", "YTA.  your daughter needs to learn boundaries.  \u201c none of your business\u201d is a perfect fine answer to your daughter. She should lose privileges for being an insensitive little snot, pushing for answers that she has no right to expect.  This is a life lesson she needs to learn.", "YTA, shut it down, the topic of why other people have or don't have kids is unacceptable.", "I don\u2019t think YTA. I believe there was one thing you probably could have done better\u2026\nOnce your child started pressing the issue, you could have given your SIL a heads-up that your 13YO was persistently asking. It would have given your SIL a chance to come up with something.", "NTA, your daughter is. \n\nBut also, telling your daughter the reason might have actually been the best choice here. Then she would have stopped asking. \n\nOr even if you didn\u2019t tell her exactly why, you could have discussed possible reasons (e.g., SIL being infertile, her husband being infertile, it could be harmful to her health to get pregnant, they might not have enough money to have a child, they may not want to adopt, they may not want to increase the overpopulation of the Earth, etc.), and how many of them are sensitive and would be hard for your SIL to discuss. That would have also helped her learn more empathy.", "NTA. \n\nYou told her not to bring it up. She did anyway. \n\n13 is damn well old enough to know that sometimes, things just aren't your business. She didn't even let up when L tried to brush her off. \n\nI think maybe explaining to L that your daughter asked, you didn't want to reveal her private medical information, and you told your daughter it wasn't her business- and she decided to ask anyway, might be a good idea. And then, I think it might be time for a talk with your daughter about how you act around other people. And how sometimes, it isn't your business and no, it doesn't matter if you're curious. it's just NO.", "**NAH.** This is hurtful topic for your SIL. Although you came from a place of good intentions, you sweeping this topic under the rug had the opposite effect. This whole incident was entirely avoidable. A truthful, private conversation with your daughter when she originally asked would have avoided this whole incident.", "NTA, at least I don\u2019t think but what you should have told your daughter was \u2018there are many reasons someone may or may not have kids. Some of those reasons can bring up Sandra\u2019s and pain but all of them are personal and not our business. Asking her is very rude and as I have warned you, I will not condone this behavior\u2019. She doesn\u2019t need to know you may or may not have information. She should have been explained that this isn\u2019t EVER a question to ask someone, family or not. Being vague only peaked the interest of a teenager.", "I'd say NTA. Is this what I have to look forward to when my daughter turns 13 \ud83e\udd74 kids just don't listen", "NTA. You tried your best to explain but your daughter disobeyed you. If L is open to it, maybe have another conversation with her to clear things up. You don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking and she doesn\u2019t know what you are. \n\nI hope you let your daughter know this was not appropriate behavior and she hurt her aunt. Explain what may be the consequences for her actions example: aunt coming around less often than she already does to avoid more awkward situations. Aunt has the choice of what she wishes to reveal. \n\nGood luck OP. Sounds like you have your hands full!", "You're not an A. You did what you thought was right, and you really handled the confrontation like a champ.\n\nIn hindsight, however, you should have just explained to your kid about infertility when you had the chance. Being vague with a 13 yo is not going to cut it. You know that now. Kids just LITERALLY don't know things. We have to tell them how the world works or they find out the hard way. It never crossed her mind that some people can't have kids. \n\nNTA", "NTA, you tried telling your daughter it was inappropriate and not to bring it up, but she did anyways, and dragged you down with her.

Some because although they may like kids, they do not want any of their own. Others because they might very much want kids, but can not have them for medical reasons. This reason can be very upsetting and painful and they might not want to talk about it. Finally, whether they can't have kids of their own or don't want kids of their own is a deeply personal topic and it's rude and insensitive to ask. \n\nSo I know you meant well, yes YTA and your daughter is a little bit too because she was told not to ask yet still chose to ask anyway.

You could have explained to your daughter that asking people about why the dont have children is extremely rude. It's like asking about their sex life. It can be hurtful.

You did your part and simply told her no in sense she was not supposed to ask that. \n\nHow are you being framed as the bad parent here when you did your part?", "NTA. Teenagers are often extremely nosy. It sounds like you froze at the question, which is understandable since you are not actually sure if you are supposed to know about SIL\u2019s fertility issues, and instead of giving your kid a reason why we don\u2019t ask these questions, you just told her not to and tried to end the subject.  Your attempts to not put your foot in your mouth ended in giving the kid a half complete answer.  We all fumble with our words, especially when caught off guard, because we are human. Making a human error does not mean you are an A H.  \n\nAlso, teenagers can be relentless, especially when they feel very close to someone. Our girls have no filter with their friends, and we have occasionally overheard some truly personal and emotional conversations they have.  I did not have these conversations with my friends until I was closer to adulthood. You said your daughter is very close with your SIL, and in my experience, really fun aunts and uncles are almost cooler older siblings, rather than parental figures. I\u2019m betting your kid just figured if she can ask her friends anything, she can ask her aunt, too. \n\nYes, you could have done better, and I hope you do have a good honest discussion with your kid about really private questions, but this was not an intentional failing on your part.", "Is your daughter on the spectrum and perhaps legitimately clueless about why such questions might be hurtful to the person she is asking?", "You're a pushover, your daughter is an AH, and your SIL is a crybaby.\n\nNothing more to be said here.", "YTA. Don't excuse your child as kids say things. Pull up your panties, grab your balls, tell the SIL that it isn't your place to tell your child HER reasons for, well, anything.

God forbid your daughter has fertility issues, you made it seem like a dirty thing that should be swept under the rug. Instead you like sparked her curiosity as to what the reason could be.

She is old enough to know that certain questions aren't asked and when to accept a deflection. What is puzzling is that she seemed to like her aunt but still behaved this way.\n\nHer problem may be with you since she dropped you in it with her hints. That is unpleasant and manipulative.

You should have put more effort into teaching your daughter about being rude and pushing issues that she has no right to. Your daughter should have listened to you when you said No don\u2019t ask her. That should have been the end of it. But you LET her argue with you. Why? That should have been the end of it right there. Your daughter is the same age as my son. My son knows empathy & respect, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have pushed the issue. She is 13, not 30.

She\u2019s 13 not 3. Answer the question. YTA", "Unfortunately, YTA. You say that \u201cI don\u2019t want to break a confidence,\u201d but the problem is that SIL never actually confided in you, so there was nothing to break. And because of this, that means the conversations you had with your MIL about SIL are / were technically gossip. It doesn\u2019t matter why your MIL told you what she told you. *You* knew that SIL hadn\u2019t brought it up with you directly. And deep down, you also know it\u2019s a touchy subject for SIL because *even you* are reluctant to bring it up with her \u2014 which means that you should have done a better job of shutting down your 13yo when she started pressing you about it. And you also should have made it clear to her that she should either: A) not to bring it up at all; or B) maybe ask Auntie (SIL) just a few questions, but not to pry if Auntie appeared hesitant to or uncomfortable in answering the questions. Children have to learn. And you should have been the one to teach her about boundaries, manners, and empathy. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have any children\u201d is a tough question for many people, and knowing when or whether it\u2019s okay to ask that depends on a lot of variables. Keep in mind that it\u2019s also possible that SIL might not have a great response queued up for that question. You should definitely apologize to SIL. Confess your sins. Tell her you screwed up. Use this as a teaching opportunity for your daughter and explain to her why what she did was wrong. But also! Don\u2019t forget you had a role in that, too. By being vague, your daughter took that as a sign that there was more to know (when you really should have been shutting that down instead). It sounds like you care for SIL, and that\u2019s what will help you (all of you) recover from this. Good luck.", "You really should have had a conversation with your daughter along the lines of, \u201cThere are a lot of reasons why someone doesn\u2019t have children. Some choose not to, and some simply can\u2019t.  Those reasons are that person\u2019s, and only that person\u2019s. Asking them questions can come across as insensitive, rude, insulting, and hurtful. You\u2019re right, Auntie IS very nice, and does seem wonderful with children. The fact of the matter is that it just isn\u2019t our business.  This applies not just to Auntie, but, to any person who has the anatomy that\u2019s necessary to grow a life.  You\u2019re more than welcome to come to me with ANY question you have, and I\u2019ll answer it to the best of my ability, but, when it comes to remarking on other people\u2019s bodies and medical history, the best course of action is to always assume it\u2019s private information.\u201d", "YTA as is your daughter.  I can\u2019t believe this was her action at 13.  Can\u2019t decide if she\u2019s deliberately cruel or obtuse.  Or just unbelievably immature?   Like a 13 year old that knows about sex and reproduction and doesn\u2019t get why you wouldn\u2019t ask?", "I'm assuming your daughter is neurotypical, since you didn't mention otherwise. If so, she needs some consequences for being rude and for going against your direct instruction not to bring it up. She's 13, not 3... pressing on such a delicate and private topic is age-inappropriate. So either she doesn't understand boundaries or she was purposely pushing past them. If it's the former... I don't know. That seems unusual and abnormal to me, honestly. If she often can't read social cues like that at her age, you might consider having her evaluated. If the latter, she was being a hurtful brat on purpose. \n\nI don't want to say YTA, really, because it seems like you just weren't sure how to shut that down. But shutting it down was your responsibility for sure. It would have been better to do it well before your daughter approached her aunt (\"that's private and not something we ask people about, people have different reasons for not having kids, etc, and it's none of your business and you are not to ask.\"), but once she started, you could have immediately and sternly told her, \"excuse me, but you are being extremely rude. You can drop this line of conversation or you can go wait in the car until the rest of us are done eating.\" \n\nBut now all there's left to do is apologize, make your daughter apologize, and if she was being awful on purpose, come up with a consequence to make her think twice about doing that again. If not on purpose, she might need some coaching to become more socially adept. Young teens aren't the most graceful, but they should generally know to avoid hurtful topics.", "YTA. You don't need to tell your daughter specifics about your SIL's situation to tell her that \"Sometimes, people choose not to have kids because they don't want to have them, but sometimes, they have medical issues that stop them from being able to have kids biologically. It can be a very emotional topic for some people, because sometimes they really want kids, but can't physically get pregnant or have had miscarriages. I don't know why your aunt doesn't have kids, but it would be very rude to ask without her bringing up the subject first.\"", "Yta by 14 i had already been told it was unlikely id have kids. Shes old enough to have been given a proper answer by you in order to stop this. Its not hard to say \u201cyou dont ask people about kids they dont have because all reasons are personal and you never know if it can be hurtful. Some people dont want kids while some would love them but can\u2019t have them. It is not a conversation piece \u201c", "Exactly, how hard is it to explain that plenty of women who would be great parents choose not to have kids or have trouble having kids, and that is absolutely fine? That would have made it clear that it\u2019s perfectly normal, and ALSO shown the kid that having kids is not the be-all end-all for all women.", "Absolutely YTA. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re talking about a 4 or 5 yr old who doesn\u2019t understand tact.

I mean, technically you were discussing her behind her back, at least enough that your daughter picked up on it. Someone\u2019s fertility shouldn\u2019t be a household conversation.

It\u2019s not like you\u2019re sheltering a young child who wouldn\u2019t understand the concept anyway. 13 is old enough to have a basic grasp on reproductive health. \n\nMaybe educate your kids better in etiquette and apologize to L?", "Wow, the daughter is 13? I missed that, thought this was about a four-year-old\u2026", "It\u2019s weird to me that a 13 yo *girl* wouldn\u2019t understand this. Most young people today will tell you they don\u2019t want children when they grow up, and many are very vocal about the assumption that women *should* want kids. Where is she getting the idea that having kids is the default?", "My thoughts precisely. By sticking to \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know\u201d - I feel like it reinforces that it\u2019s an \u201codd\u201d lifestyle. Why not normalise the idea and demystify it?", "Why not just explain to your daughter that other people's reproductive status is none of anyone else's business?", "You were hung up on betraying an adult by telling a CHILD her business? Please tell me your daughter is not your friend.", "As someone who struggled a long time to have kids, please be direct with SIL. I'd bring up that daughter was curious.

Again, I assume you must. \n\nDo you understand that not all people want to have children? And do you realize that those people can get mighty tired of other people pressing them on the subject? \n\nDo you understand that, just in general, people should never, ever ask other people why they don't have children, if they want or plan to have children, and/or when they intend to have children? Do you understand that this is because doing any of those things is rude, presumptuous, and can be deeply painful for the person being asked? \n\nSo ***why on earth didn't you say those things to your daughter??*** Do you not understand that part of your job as a parent is to teach your children how to behave in the world? This entails, among other things, teaching your children not to say or ask things that are wildly insensitive, incredibly rude, and potentially extremely hurtful.

In general, people who don\u2019t have kids either didn\u2019t want them, or they DID want kids and may have tried for years without success. They may have even had miscarriages or had adoptions fall through.\u201d \n\nIf she kept asking, keep telling her that you don\u2019t know the details about her aunt\u2019s situation and stick to general facts.

You could have put more emphasis on that, on the idea that questions like that are personal and rude and that even if curious you have to know when to keep that stuff to yourself. Normalising adult women not having kids is a good thing to do and the fact your kid so equates womanhood with kids is kind of sad in its own way. \n\nAs for L, honestly, at that point you probably should have just let the cat out of the bag rather than leave it hanging.

After 4 years of trying (read multiple drs, specialists, surgeries, rounds of ivf), I am pregnant and due November. My response is coming from this perspective-\n\nI don\u2019t want to label anyone an AH here. The situation is complex and nuanced. Aside from the situation, it\u2019s clear better open and honest communication needs to occur between yourself and your daughter, which hopefully will promote better trust from your daughter and respect between the two of you. \n\nI think an open and vulnerable conversation with your SIL needs to occur whereby you provide the information you have been given, and provide the intent of the information shared. Whilst the information may not have been provided by her to others as \u2018free to spread\u2019, it appears the intent was to ensure safe spaces whereby she wasn\u2019t hurt by unintentional harmful comments. The truth may hurt her, but if led with love and honesty, hopefully she will appreciate the intent and understand the conversations we\u2019re minimal and held to try and support her. \n\nShe has the rights to her feelings, whatever they may be. But you feeling bad for her won\u2019t help her. Honesty, love and support will help her. \n\nWhatever you are feeling about being in the wrong is (sadly and unfortunately) no comparison to the pain and grief she lives with every single day. So, I say this with love, leave your feelings and your actions alone, get out of your own way, and just be honest with her. \n\nFinally, trying to stop your daughter from talking about this (or any uncomfortable situations) will not stop her from wondering. So perhaps challenge the way you and she think by challenging the societal norm that says she should have children? You may know that a person doesn\u2019t have children because of a medical reason, but what if you didn\u2019t know this? Is their choice not to have children not ok? If it is or it isn\u2019t, why should you get the right to ask and cast judgements on their actions? \n\nYour daughter said our SIL is nice and why doesn\u2019t she have children. The implication there is that only mean parents don\u2019t have children? Or only nice ones do? It\u2019s about challenging her thinking. The choice to have a child lies with a person or a couple. This may be influenced by medical or other factors. The judgement is not kind nor necessary. \n\nSupport your daughter, and yourself, to understand all humans are different and if you lead with love and kindness, respect follows. \n\nI hope this has helped a little.

Teach your kid that not all couples have children and that there can be many reasons as to why that might be.

I can just...ask if there are any dishes with egg mixed in it _because_ I have a friend with food allergies and said friend can listen in. I can also tell more stories about my ex without bringing up that it is my ex. Shhhh. \ud83d\ude1c\n\nThis is a similar situation. You knew your daughter had latched onto this topic and was unlikely to let it go. She's also of an age where learning about sex and reproduction makes sense. You could have had a talk with her about that separate from the topic of your SIL where you discussed infertility and being child free and how both of them are very loaded subjects. And why it's rude to twenty question people without children because it could be either issue and both are pain points when someone is grilling you on it. This will probably be a lot of conversations because it's a complex topic, but you can start with the basics.\n\nThen when she asked about SIL again you could reference that earlier conversation and say it's inappropriate to ask because whether it's one or the other, it's a painful conversation that you don't just hit someone with out of the blue. Plus it falls under bad gossip in most cases. SIL does not answer to your daughter. I imagine your daughter just thinks she's great and that anyone would be lucky to have her as their parent. I imagine she also knows very few women who don't have kids.\n\nSo now you need to apologize to you SIL. You didn't know how to tell her _why_ it was not her business and you are so sorry it came up over dinner. You have since figured out how to have a conversation about why the question was inappropriate with your daughter and it won't come up again. And then make sure it doesn't unless SIL initiates. And I'm talking your kid knows she will be grounded if she pulls that again level of assurance. You daughter does not need to know which reason your SIL had. There are FB groups and YouTube videos of people who are willing to talk about their experiences. If she's still curious, that's where you need to go with her.\n\nFinally, your daughter should be in some form of trouble. She also needs to apologize to SIL for being nosy. Then she needs to do something like extra chores for a while, miss out on something or, even better, write a paper on reasons why people don't have kids sometimes. Because you _told_ her not to ask and she did it anyway. There have to be consequences.\n\nP.S. Please also discuss breastfeeding with your daughter. I was completely inadequately prepared when my young friend was struggling with it. I would give so much to be able to go back in time and tell her it was okay to bottle feed because her being less stressed and not in agony was more important than any perceived benefit for breastfeeding.
