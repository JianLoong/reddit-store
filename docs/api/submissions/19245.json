I don\u2019t know why you wouldn\u2019t just explain to your child that not all women have kids. Some by choice and some through no choice of their own, and since we don\u2019t always know if it might be an upsetting reason, we don\u2019t put people on the spot and ask them casually.\n\nTo be clear- You said you were being vague- so I have no idea if that means you had the above conversation or just said \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and tried to change the subject. I\u2019m basing my judgement on the latter.", "Yeah, YTA, sorry- Your daughter is 13, she should know by now what boundaries are. That was really rude, especially since she kept at it. You should have told your daughter not all women have children for various reasons and it's nobodies business as to why, it's not something you ask about.", "INFO: You told your daughter not to bring up the topic because it may upset your aunt and she did it anyway, then lied and said you already told her the reason why.  Sounds like your daughter was disrespectful to you and her aunt.   Do you plan on addressing that?", "Yes you're the AH. You should have told your daughter that it's rude to ask these type of question and how to mind her own business! I'd expect these kind of questions from a 5 year old instead of a 13 years old. 13 is old enough to know better.", "YTA seriously, be a parent! How hard is it to say - there are a lot of reasons people don\u2019t or can\u2019t have children. It is generally rude to ask why. Even if she is your aunt, Do not ask her why because if it is private or painful reason, you will hurt her.  \n\nYou totally failed here. This kind of passive \u201cparenting\u201d if you can even call it that drives me nuts.", "Slight YTA\n\nYour daughter is old enough to ask these questions. So she is also old enough to learn that people are allowed to keep private information private.\n\nYou did great up to the point where you said you didn\u2019t know why L didn\u2019t have children. \n\nThis is where you can teach your daughter a valuable lesson.\n\n\u201c I don\u2019t know why L doesn\u2019t have children. I would never ask her such a personal question. There are many reasons why people can\u2019t or don\u2019t have kids, and some of the reasons can be painful. If L wants me to know why she doesn\u2019t have children, she will tell me. \n\n\u201c Sometimes, we really want to know something. But when that something involves another person, we have to let that person keep their private matters private. Yes, we want to know. But we have no right to know. Sometimes, we don\u2019t get the answers we want. \n\n\u201cSometimes, we are faced with questions that will never be answered. And we just have to accept that and move on. \n\n\u201cAlways, before asking someone a personal question, you need to ask yourself, do your really need this information or do you just want this information. You don\u2019t need to know why Auntie L doesn\u2019t have kids, you just want to know. And that means you don\u2019t ask.\u201d", "I know there\u2019s a lot of NTAs going on in here\u2026but, you\u2019re a little bit AH for not explaining to your 13 y.o. WHY this is inappropriate.\n\nYou telling your daughter to be respectful in not bringing up Auntie\u2019s fertility issues would\u2019ve made a lot more sense to the kid if she understood it was for a very painful reason. She\u2019s old enough to feel empathy.", "YTA and so is your daughter.  This was an opportunity for you to teach your daughter that \"nice people\" don't have to have children and that asking people personal questions is rude.", "YTA, there are age appropriate ways to discuss this with children. This is obviously a soft spot for your sister. Your daughter should learn basic manners that it\u2019s disrespectful to ask anyone about their status as childless/child free/when are you having more. If more people did this we\u2019d have less asshole adults.", "YTA. You could have explained the medical side of it to your daughter. I am unable to have children of my own, yes it hurts but it also hurts for my family to act awkward around me because of it. Like you are doing to her.", "YTA.\n\n\"That's a very personal subject and it's rude to ask someone that\" was all you had to say instead of being deliberately vague.  You absolutely could have and should have prevented this.", "YTA. Per your title.   Yes, you should have stopped her.  Your daughter really needs to learn to mind her own business.  Your SIL tried to answer vaguely but she pushed.  She also said before the dinner she planned on asking, sounds like multiple times per your rinse and repeat.  You should have totally shut her down\u2026hard. \n\nYour daughter is WAY TOO OLD to be acting like a 7 year old who can\u2019t understand. \n\nI get that you tried to not disclose a confidence.   But, you could have said, there is an actual reason, that\u2019s not my place to say, so please rest assured you do not need to ask her why.", "Yes,  YTA. You can't tell a prying 13 yr old \"I don't know\" and then,  \"don't ask! She might get upset.\" This is 100% your fault.  You made it a thing.  \nInfertility is fairly common these days,  coupled with the fact that you said SIL has always been fine with kids, I don't know why you even think she'd be upset.  You could have been honest with your daughter.  'I've been told she can't,  and I imagine that makes her sad so we don't ask bc we don't want to hurt her feelings.' Or you could have been vague.  'That's a very personal question. Just like we don't ask people about their finances,  that's not really something you ask people sweetie. It's considered very rude.' \nThis is 100% on you.", "YTA. \"Not all woman have children.\"  Period. End of story. That's exactly what you say.  And if she continues to ask, 13 is a reasonable age to be told to knock it off and stop making her aunt uncomfortable.", "When my kids started asking why my brother and SIL didn't have kids, I told them not everyone can and that it's none of their business anyway.  I also said that if they brought it up, they would be in trouble.  Even if you didn't want to say anything about infertility, you could have said it's none of your business, and if you bring it up, you'll be in trouble. Yta", "I am not sure what judgement to give, but your daughter, at 13, is old enough to know you do not ask people about their bodies or kids/choices around kids without an invitation to do so.\n\nGranted at 13 is also old enough ti do so anyway/push the boundaries of manners, but then consequences, line grounding or loss of privileges, seem fair.", "Yta\n\nHow hard is it to sit down and explain to your daughter that asking such personal questions can be super hurtful?? Do you want to raise someone without empathy? Cause you\u2019re in your way there. Yes teenagers are aholes but that\u2019s why they have parents to sit them down, and explain things in detail, to list all of the things that could be wrong with aunt and why it would hurt. And for you to help her relate to it.", "Not necessarily TA, but it could have been handled better. 13 is old enough to understand the base medical explanation and to know that some topics aren\u2019t polite to bring up as they can be painful. If she was that insistent you could have explained the reason and asked her not to bring it up as it would be painful for her aunt. Would have avoided any drama.", "I went through infertility for years. When my niece asked me why I didn't have kids I told her, \"Just because you want something, doesn't mean it'll happen.\" She understood that I did want kids, but sometimes it doesn't happen just because you want it. Your daughter is 13 she is old enough to know about sex education. Sit her down and explain sex to her (if you haven't already) that a lot of things can go wrong or just not happen. Also explain to her that her aunt would love to have children, but hasn't been able to and it's the cause of a lot of pain, so that is why you don't want her asking about it. When she sees her aunt and uncle, she can give them big hugs if she would like to and tell them she loves them. Communication solves a lot of hurt feelings.", "YTA.  A big one.  Why didn\u2019t you teach your daughter better?", "Esh except the Sil.  Your daughter is 13 not 3, she is darn old enogh to not ask a question that she has been told will upset someone. \n \nNext time its time form a visit, \n'You're not coming to Aunties bc you purposefully asked a question that i told you not to ask and upset her'  and then hire a babysitter.", "Your daughter is TA.", "YTA But softly \n\nUnfortunately your daughter doesn\u2019t seem to have learnt any manners. Despite you telling her not to ask, she still went and did it. And she\u2019s 13! She should know better. \n\nYou didn\u2019t your best to handle the situation, whilst trying to maintain someone\u2019s privacy. But it still didn\u2019t work out well.", "YTA\n\nYour teen came to you for advice. Instead of clearly outlining the situation, and how rude it will be to ask directly, you permitted a gap of understanding to ferment in your teens brain.\n\nDoesn\u2019t your teen think the family who\u2019s been around longer than she has realize the aunt has fertility issues? \n\nOn what planet is it ok for you to coyly suggest your teen should be able to ask, as if this was a family secret that needed to be asked in public by someone brave enough to ask?\n\nYou should have been a parent. Instead you behaved like a HIPPA specialist afraid to be sued.", "YTA. When your daughter started asking, you needed to give her an answer. If you don't want to break a confidence, go to L (or have your husband, her brother, do so, or even via your MIL) and ask HER what she wants your daughter to know. Especially as your daughter kept bringing it up.", "YTA \n\nWhy didn\u2019t you tell your daughter the truth? That maybe she doesn\u2019t want them, or maybe she actually can\u2019t have them and that it\u2019s a sensitive topic to bring up? And that she may hurt her aunts feelings by asking?", "Soft YTA\n\nIt's your role as a parent to teach your daughter not to be rude. And she doesn't have to know the reason why your SIL can't have children since your SIL want to keep it private.\n\n13 yo should know that being nosy is rude and you're not entitled to everyone's private informations, including family.", "YTA - would have been an excellent time to have a discussion with your daughter about children: the incorrect assumption that all women want them or the fact that some people struggle to conceive or choose not to due to hereditary illness.\nYou didn\u2019t have to get in to graphic specifics and could keep it PG13 but just enough to educate her, before making it clear that it\u2019s incredibly rude to ask someone why they don\u2019t have children. And that it\u2019s always for the person without children to initiate any discussion about why they don\u2019t have kids.  None of this would be betraying a confidence as you aren\u2019t confirming anything about your aunt.\n\nIf you\u2019d dealt with it head on, instead of dancing around the subject would have saved a lot of drama and the obvious hurt that has been caused to your Aunt", "YTA. You peeked her interest by avoiding her questions. All you really needed to say was not everyone wants or chooses to have children and families look like different things to different people. Then if she pushed it explain how asking such personal questions is rude, etc.", "My cousin in her 40's doesn't have kids and my MIL keeps asking me why. I told her that not everyone wants children and it's her (my cousins) business and not the worlds.", "YTA.\n\nYou could have answered honestly without breaking confidence: that you didn\u2019t know for certain but there\u2019s lots of reasons someone doesn\u2019t have children, whether it\u2019s their choice or due to infertility. It can be a very sensitive subject for people and asking them directly could cause someone pain. It\u2019s also not anyone\u2019s business, and is a good example of who just because you are interested in information doesn\u2019t mean you are entitled to it.", "NTA but your daughter was acting like one. Also tactless. As her mom you should have told her that there are things inappropriate to ask other people such as their age, income, personal choices such as getting married/having kids, sexuality, someone\u2019s appearance (ie weight, height), etc.\n\nDepending on your relationship with your sister, you can call her up, apologize and explain that you just did not know what to tell your daughter and also tell her how you\u2019re going to do better.", "Unsure why you did not tell the truth to your daughter, in words she could process given her age?", "Nta. Teenagers are a holes. 13 is old enough to know manners and discretion and NOT everything is her business despite wanting to know. I hope there are some repercussions to her for her blatant rudeness.", "NTA not much you could have done. But at 13, your daughter is old enough to know better. You told jer not to ask, stating it would upset her aunt. She chose to do it anyway. \n\nShe needs a stern talking to, about boundaries and respecting people's privacy.", "YTA. You should have explained to your daughter that asking people why they don\u2019t have children is rude and invasive, and explained more generally that it can be for a whole host of reasons, including infertility or other medical issues, and made it very clear that it was none of her business. \n\nYour daughter is definitely old enough to know better and learn basic respect and manners, as well as some life lessons that nobody \u201chas to\u201d have kids.", "YTA. If someone isn\u2019t volunteering info or bringing it up, it is not appropriate. It\u2019s no one\u2019s business if it\u2019s fertility issues or simply because she doesn\u2019t want to, it\u2019s an inappropriate question and that\u2019s what you should have told your daughter both in private and then publicly when she did bring it up. She\u2019s not a tiny child who doesn\u2019t know better, she\u2019s a teenager.", "YTA.  your daughter needs to learn boundaries.  \u201c none of your business\u201d is a perfect fine answer to your daughter. She should lose privileges for being an insensitive little snot, pushing for answers that she has no right to expect.  This is a life lesson she needs to learn.", "YTA, shut it down, the topic of why other people have or don't have kids is unacceptable.", "I don\u2019t think YTA. I believe there was one thing you probably could have done better\u2026\nOnce your child started pressing the issue, you could have given your SIL a heads-up that your 13YO was persistently asking. It would have given your SIL a chance to come up with something.", "NTA, your daughter is. \n\nBut also, telling your daughter the reason might have actually been the best choice here. Then she would have stopped asking. \n\nOr even if you didn\u2019t tell her exactly why, you could have discussed possible reasons (e.g., SIL being infertile, her husband being infertile, it could be harmful to her health to get pregnant, they might not have enough money to have a child, they may not want to adopt, they may not want to increase the overpopulation of the Earth, etc.), and how many of them are sensitive and would be hard for your SIL to discuss. That would have also helped her learn more empathy.", "NTA. \n\nYou told her not to bring it up. She did anyway. \n\n13 is damn well old enough to know that sometimes, things just aren't your business. She didn't even let up when L tried to brush her off. \n\nI think maybe explaining to L that your daughter asked, you didn't want to reveal her private medical information, and you told your daughter it wasn't her business- and she decided to ask anyway, might be a good idea. And then, I think it might be time for a talk with your daughter about how you act around other people. And how sometimes, it isn't your business and no, it doesn't matter if you're curious. it's just NO.", "**NAH.** This is hurtful topic for your SIL. Although you came from a place of good intentions, you sweeping this topic under the rug had the opposite effect. This whole incident was entirely avoidable. A truthful, private conversation with your daughter when she originally asked would have avoided this whole incident.", "NTA, at least I don\u2019t think but what you should have told your daughter was \u2018there are many reasons someone may or may not have kids. Some of those reasons can bring up Sandra\u2019s and pain but all of them are personal and not our business. Asking her is very rude and as I have warned you, I will not condone this behavior\u2019. She doesn\u2019t need to know you may or may not have information. She should have been explained that this isn\u2019t EVER a question to ask someone, family or not. Being vague only peaked the interest of a teenager.", "I'd say NTA. Is this what I have to look forward to when my daughter turns 13 \ud83e\udd74 kids just don't listen", "NTA. You tried your best to explain but your daughter disobeyed you. If L is open to it, maybe have another conversation with her to clear things up. You don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking and she doesn\u2019t know what you are. \n\nI hope you let your daughter know this was not appropriate behavior and she hurt her aunt. Explain what may be the consequences for her actions example: aunt coming around less often than she already does to avoid more awkward situations. Aunt has the choice of what she wishes to reveal. \n\nGood luck OP. Sounds like you have your hands full!", "You're not an A. You did what you thought was right, and you really handled the confrontation like a champ.\n\nIn hindsight, however, you should have just explained to your kid about infertility when you had the chance. Being vague with a 13 yo is not going to cut it. You know that now. Kids just LITERALLY don't know things. We have to tell them how the world works or they find out the hard way. It never crossed her mind that some people can't have kids. \n\nNTA", "NTA, you tried telling your daughter it was inappropriate and not to bring it up, but she did anyways, and dragged you down with her.

I\u2019m just upset at how my SIL feels and whisking I\u2019d done something different.", "Thanks for the suggestions.", "I probably agree. I was just worried about sharing someone else\u2019s private info. But that may have been better.", "I agree. I just feel it\u2019s someone else\u2019s secret though, which is why I was vague.", "To be clear, your daughter was also an AH. She\u2019s old enough to follow a simple instruction and you DID warn her that it might cause upset. \n\nI do feel though, that your vague approach may mean that she didn\u2019t really understand HOW upset someone might be in that situation.\n\nI understand that you were trying to navigate a tricky situation without breaching someone else\u2019s privacy though. It was a tough one.", "If you don't address your daughters disrespect don't you think it is going to happen again, not just regarding the aunt but other things too?    Maybe take away something your daughter likes for a period of time so that she understands there are consequences for her actions?", "You can have a chat with SIL and explain that you thought you had addressed the situation by attempting to maintain her privacy.  Let her know how much it upset you that these efforts were in vain.  Tell the the consequences you have established with your daughter  so your daughter learns you expect others.  \n\nAlso, ask you daughter why she is so stuck on the topic.  You might find out things you need to know.  In fact, that\u2019s where I would start.  Let SIL know that if this is idle curiosity you will give her consequences.  Reassure SIL that she matters and her privacy and autonomy matter as well.  Kindness and understanding will be your friends as you talk to them both", "[deleted]", "I feel for ya, OP. I really do.\n\nAND, I know you can make this right between the 3 of you with a simple conversation or two\u2026you sound like a very loving individual, & every loving individual I\u2019ve ever known is surrounded by equally loving individuals. They\u2019ll get it. \ud83d\ude09 \n\nWishing you all the best. \u2764\ufe0f", "Maybe it's time \u2764\ufe0f she may feel very isolated. I wish you all the best.", "Ones that can't be trusted do.", "Then OP should have just told her \"I don't know because It's rude to ask.\" End of story.", "You didn't have to tell her a secret. You could have said that people don't have kids for a variety of reasons and asking personal questions like that is rude so don't do it.", "It would have been simple enough to have a vague conversation that not all people are able to have babies and not all people want babies\u2026a 13 year old should be able to grasp that.", "Do you trust your daughter to keep a secret or at least understand not to bring a topic if you ask?", "Calm definitely is required lol Teenage girls thrive on emotional drama and riling up Mom.  \ud83e\udd23", "For this specific comment here, I\u2019m going to say you were TA in this.  Your daughter is young and inexperienced, and curious.  Seeing how curious she was, you should have explained that there are many reasons people don\u2019t have children, and most of them are deeply personal, and not generally something people enjoy being asked about.\n\nYou told her not to ask, but you didn\u2019t do anything to help her understand why she shouldn\u2019t ask - or to help her be empathetic in the situation.\n\nAt 13, it\u2019s not enough to just say \u201cdon\u2019t do this\u201d, you should be helping her learn and grow too.  Just telling her to ignore it at that age is akin to putting the cookie jar on the top shelf - it\u2019s not going to stop them and will just lead to unnecessary drama.", "You don't have to share someone's private information to teach your child that asking that question is ALWAYS rude. You can let her know that everyone has the right to privacy. It sounds like your daughter has not learned boundaries at all. Why is she pushing when people don't want to answer questions?", "You don't necessarily have to share the information you know. You can keep it age appropriate and explain that the topic is hurtful and something that should only be appproached with caution because the family loves SIL.", "Jesus, if this is you trying to be kind to someone, I\u2019d hate to see how you\u2019d be if you were trying to cause harm.", "The correct way to handle this would have been to explain the reasons people don\u2019t have children. Choice, finances, infertility etc. Then explain that each persons choice is personal and sometimes very painful for them to discuss, so it\u2019s not a question that we ask people without them bringing up the topic first.", "Sure, totally. You don't have to say WHO is infertile.\n\nInfertility is a big issue in my family. I'm adopted because my mom had endometriosis. I get it.\n\nParenting is hard. Don't beat yourself up but don't be too mad at your kid either", "Yes I do agree and will certainly be addressing it.", "I'm sure she means upset at her daughter because SIL is upset.", "Thanks", "I know a lot of 13yo who can't deal with vague answers. I would have called the aunt and ask if I can share the real answer or not, and then figure out the words in each option.", "Honestly, I think that\u2019s exactly why she\u2019s done this. But I will deal with her with icy calm \ud83e\udd76", "Can\u2019t disagree. I was concerned about not sharing someone else\u2019s secret but other comments here have given me good ways to do it. I think I was a too bit hung up on this. I\u2019m not actually going to kill her, I\u2019m going to deal with it appropriately and have had some good advice here.", "Yes that\u2019s fair enough. Can\u2019t have been worse.", "Awesome, hang in there, teenage years are fun, lol \ud83d\udc4d", "SIL and I have never spoken about it. What I know if from her mother and I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s even aware her mother has told us this. That\u2019s why I\u2019m struggling with it."]}
