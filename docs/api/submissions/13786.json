I love sewing, knitting, sculpting and so on. Everyone knows this about me and so it always heavily influences what I'm gifted for Christmases and birthdays. This birthday my (26f) cousin bought me a brand new knitting machine, I'd been wanting one for an incredibly long time, although hadn't bought one myself as its a bit of an investment piece. I was really thankful and happy for the gift and I absolutely adore using it. The machine has given me the ability to try many different patterns and make wildly different things with my knitting. Such as crop tops, sweatshirts, beanies, scrunchies, handbags and so on. It took me a little while to get used to the machine and be able to use it to its full potential. Now here's where the problem comes in. I've recently opened a small business where I sell many different craft products many of which are completely funded by myself and have nothing to do with the machine; but my most popular items are often my knitting machine made items, I buy all the wool and yarn myself and make everything by hand with the machine. My cousin recently found out that I use the machine in my business and says it's unfair that i am making money off of a gift they gave to me because I didn't need to invest the money on buying the machine, they did and is demanding I pay her back the full price it cost to buy the machine. I find this extremely unfair as it was their gift to me and I shouldn't be expected to pay them back, especially as all the other materials are paid for by me. I'm really conflicted on what to do because I really don't want drama and am thinking of just paying them back to avoid problems but I feel that I shouldn't need to pay them back because it was a gift in the first place.

It was a gift and you can do whatever you want with it.", "NTA.

Oh heck no. Your cousin is trying to profit off of your ingenuity and hard work. This is one of the moments of your life to learn to stand up for yourself.

If I could share one thing with my 17 year old self, it would be that.\n\nIf helps you could say something like: \"I'm sorry you feel that way. It was a thoughtful gift, and I do appreciate it.

A gift is used however you want it to be used whether it\u2019s getting a great use in your case, or taking up dust in the basement which it would be if it was gifted to me.

The machine was a gift, it is yours to do with what you want. Your cousin cannot expect to give someone a present and afterwards create rules on how you're allowed to use it. The only reason to pay her back imo would be to avoid further clashes (to protect you, not to satisfy her), and then go little or no contact. You said you don't want drama, so maybe think different scenarios through how this may unfold and what is the best way for you. But you should not get bullied into paying if you don't want to, that is your choice. And your cousin should definitely learn that there are consequences to behaviour like that...\n\nOff topic side note: may I ask what machine you have? I've been looking into getting one and am still undecided :) And congrats on the business!", "NTA. Be petty and give her her gift back. You have already decided to pay her the price of machine, so I can assume that you could buy it new yourself. So buy new, and give her machine back. that way you will be severing the cord of future arguments and entitlements of your cousin. \"She wouldn't be where she is now with her business if it weren't me who bought her knitting machine\" , \"I am entitled to some part of your profit because I gave your key machinery\".  She can keep her machine and do whatever she'd want to do with it !!! \n\nPlease don't give her money.

You do whatever you want with it because it's yours, just because it's a practical gift that allows you to make sellable items doesn't make it any less a gift.\nNTA, honestly your cousin sounds like they're just in need of some easy cash.", "Wow, does said family member want a share of the money you\u2019re making on the sale of items, as well? \n\nNTA", "Don't cave, honey! It was a gift with no strings (or yarn) attached! NTA and I can't believe people are so callous and petty to demand money back because you are USING their gift. Invest your money and labour and I wish you a ton os success!", "This is ridiculous. It was a gift and it's none of their business how you use it! NTA", "NTA. That is ridiculous! If I were your cousin, I would be SO SO happy for you and pleased you were using my gift to start a business.", "My suggestion is, give them the machine back instead of the payment and buy another machine with the money you have. Because it's clear that your cousin is trying to manipulate you into giving them a share as if they invested in your business which is untrue. They gave you a gift and they are not entitled to the money you are earning. But just to stop the drama, give them the machine back because the machine would be useless for them but their entitlement towards your business will end then and there...\n\nNTA", "NTA what is wrong with her? I like knitting too, and it ain't cheap, easy nor quick. You deserve every cent you make honey", "HARD NTA. Your cousin is beyond ridiculous. Once you give someone a gift, you no longer have any say over it. If I or anyone I knew gave someone a gift and they were making money off of it, we'd be DELIGHTED for them. Don't give your cousin a dime.", "NTA, they gave it to you, so you can do whatever you want with it", "NTA your cousin is absolutely wrong. Its a gift you enjoy. Why is she upset? If you buy a hairdresser nice scissors are you able to claim profits from her services using those shears? You can\u2019t give a gift then demand a return on it later if the receiver uses it in a way you do not approve up. She\u2019s not an investor in your business. If you start a landscaping business and one of your tools was a gift (blower) the gift giver does not get pay back from that gift. She is so silly.", "It was a gift. Your cousin GAVE you a generous, but now she has turned into a huge ah. Tell her to bug off.", "NTA", "NTA. Wow. Your cousin sounds like the AH. What did she expect you to do with a knitting machine?  Sheesh.", "Your cousin is jealous\u2026 that\u2019s all. NTA but your cousin for sure is.", "NTA, ur cousin brought u that gift knowing it means u don\u2019t have to pay it back, that\u2019s the literal definition on a gift, I\u2019m assuming u didn\u2019t ask for the gift so u shouldn\u2019t have to pay them back, infact they should be happy that ur making something of urself with it. On top of all of that u are a minor who needs that money to start off ur future improve ur business for a better future, DO NOT PAY THEM BACK.", "NTA - your cousin sounds unhinged to be honest. Genuinely found this story crazy.", "NTA. I have a small business selling my art and my family also uses gift giving holidays to help me grow. She should be thrilled you\u2019ve enjoyed her gift so thoroughly and she was able to help you start generating income doing something you enjoy! What a turd.", "NTA That's very greedy, jealous and generally ill mannered behavior. She should be happy and content that she gave you a useful gift. I'm super embarrassed for her.", "NTA. Your cousin is crazy", "I would pay her back and never would take any \u201cgift\u201d from her again. Pay back in coins.", "NTA! that is such bizarre, manipulative behavior coming from a whole ass adult.", "NTA, she is being unreasonable.\n\nThe petty me would pay her back and go NC with her.", "NTA. But if it were financially possible, I would just buy another machine, return hers and cut her off completely.", "Your cousin needs to remember her manners", "Avid knitter and wool lover here. NTA. I know well how expensive a knitting machine can be. You're entirely right when you say it's a signature piece, but that's on *her*, not you. She chose to gift you a very expensive and lovely gift, and the whole situation involving her ends there. \nShe does not get to take back a gift. You just don't do that, it's rude and goes against the part of gift giving where you, idk, *give* the gift. Not lend it, or see it as an investment to be made in the future. Your cousin is jealous and has fomo because they didn't realize just how useful a skill like knitting can be, and how lucrative the craft can get at times. All there is to say about that is too bad for them, they can learn the craft themselves, dish out the money for another machine, plus spare parts, fibers, instructions, and finishing add ons like wool soap, and go set up their own store. Their machine did not make you successful. Your knowledge of the trade made you successful. The knitting machine just made you more efficient. \nCongratulations on the piece! They're beautiful beasts, and I hope to buy one myself one day. I'd love to see your work if you feel like sharing! I love what our community comes up with, and am quite curious to see your creations!", "NTA. Your cousin is being ridiculous. There is zero obligation for you to only use her gift for personal purposes. There is zero obligation to pay her back for a gift she freely gave you. She has zero claim on the profits you\u2019re making from your business. There is nothing unfair about how you\u2019ve chosen to use her gift.\n\nShe sounds like a very petty person who starts acting sketchy/entitled the moment she sees dollar signs. I would keep this cousin at an arms distance and stop exchanging/accepting gifts from her.", "Your cousin is jealous as shit. Tell them you're not paying them back but be prepared they will likely engage in drama and cut you off. Beats paying them though. Either way you're going to be left with the sour taste of betrayal in your mouth, but at least by not forking over money you'll have your dignity intact.", "If your cousin bought you a pencil, and you drew a picture with it and got paid for said picture, would she say you owed her then?", "NTA. Your cousin is crazy", "NTAH.  A gift is a gift.  Move on.", "NTA. Your cousin should be proud that they helped contribute to your business!", "If someone buys me a nice shirt and I wear the shirt to a job interview and get hired, am I obligated to give that person a percentage of my paycheck? You\u2019re NTA but your cousin most definitely is!", "NTA Of course. Who the hell would call for payment because you're using a GIFT????? I could understand your cousin if she gave you a personal recipe and you were using that for profit. But she went to a store and bought a machine. Period.", "NTA. It was a fucking gift. She doesn't get to determine what you then use it for. Do not pay her back. She's acting entitled.", "NTA, whether that gift was to be used as a hobby or for a small business venture has nothing to do with the gift giver and has everything to do with the gift receiver. I would have celebrated the idea that my gift is making you happy and supporting your lifestyle. Why do people have to be bitter about others' success.", "Are y fn kidding me;!!!", "NTA. Worst comes to worst, give the sewing machine back and buy your own. But you don't owe your cousin anything. Especially money", "Nta. I thought from the title it was going to be like \"My [relation] bought me a [phone/jewelry/clothing/video game] and I sold it. Aita?\" But this is very solidly Nta. What else are you supposed to do with a knitting machine? It's like being mad someone who quilts is selling a blanket made with a gifted sewing machine", "NTA.  I\u2019m super concerned that you even have to ask this.  Makes me think your relationship with your cousin isn\u2019t healthy.", "NTA.  \n\nA gift is a gift is a gift.\n\nYour cousin is the asshole, and a jealous one at that.  Do not fall for her emotional blackmail.\n\nBest of luck in your business venture!!", "NTA and from someone who wrangled with a knitting machine and gave up those things are difficult to use! There's a steep learning curve and anything produced is still hand made.", "NTA. A gift is a gift. The giver does not have the right to say that you can't make money using the gift or even if you choose to never use the gift. Once it was given to you, it became yours to do with as you wish.", "NTA. I say you should knit a few (fake) $100 bills and send them to your cousin.", "NTA.\n\nA trend in AITA in situations like this is the cousin may badmouth you to other family members, who then take their side.\n\nI would be cordial and friendly with my cousin going forward except I would 1) never accept a gift from them again and 2) have a quick response at the ready for the cousin or anyone who sides with her \u201cin the past, cousin added conditions on when and how I could use it gift, after I had accepted it.That\u2019s an obligation, not a gift. As a result I can not accept this new gift, as you and I have different expectations of what constitutes a gift. Thank you for thinking of me.\u201d", "That\u2019s the most absurd thing I heard in a long time. A gift is a gift and she should be glad you are using it to it\u2019s full potential. The machine is just an add-on, it\u2019s your skills that have made your business successful.\nIf she continues with the drama, just give her the machine back and cut ties with her.", "NTA. Your cousin is being ridiculous. A gift shouldn\u2019t have any conditions. I wouldn\u2019t be paying her back. \n\nHowever\u2026.. if you now could do with a better machine, save up and get one. Then give her back her gift. She then has nothing to gripe about. But she will have something that she doesn\u2019t need and will likely realise this became about money for her.", "NTA- not sure what your cousin expected.", "NTA but I think everyone hear thinks you cousin is a big one. Gifts belong to the recipient and they are free to do whatever they want with it. Good on you that you were able to turn this gift into a small business!", "NTA\n\nYour cousin bought you a nice gift for what she thought was '***your cute little hobby****'.*  Then finds out you're actually able to make **money!** from said 'little hobby'. Cousin goes into the \"give me, give me, give me\" nonsense. Cousin is just being greedy.\n\nYou do **not** need to \"pay them back\" for anything. Simply return the 'gift' to your cousin & let cousin figure out how to use it. Then use some of your earnings & purchase your own knitting machine. \n\nIt's a business expense & can probably be tax deductible.", "Your cousin is both wrong and insane.  NTA", "NTA. Give them the money back and then go no contact.", "god I thought you meant flipping it for a profit. NTA for using a gift as it was intended", "NTA A gift is a gift, once given, you no longer have a say.  However, how close are you to your cousins? If you see them a lot or they are close to your family, it might be better to pay for it and just keep the peace.  Then never receive or give them anything again.  If they ask why, just say that you don't want to pay for any more of their gifts.  Then tell you made so much money using the knitting machine that it was paid for very quickly.  Sweet revenge.", "NTA. What a ludicrous ask. It was a gift and you\u2019re using it.", "NTA\n\n\"What did you want me to use the knitting machine for?\"", "NTA.   Your cousin, on the other hand, is an asshole.    Its not like you regifted or sold the machine for profit.  You are simply using the machine the way it's intended.   \n\nI don't get the people who think they have a say in the gift after it's been gifted.", "NTA. Your cousin gifted it to you, meaning you now own it and can do whatever you want with it. Cousin demanding the money back is absolutely ridiculous.", "Tell your jealous and entitled a-hole of a cousin to f... kick rocks and then go LC with them. NTA\n\n((I really cannot believe the fugging audacity of some people... wtaf???))", "NTA\n\nDon't accept any lottery tickets from this person as a gift, either, they're not very clear on what the word \"gift\" means.\n\nYou do you, babe, I love that for you.  This person is just the first of the many negative and entitled persons you're going to have to deal with in your life.  Don't worry about them, everybody knows what's going on, it's greed and entitlement.", "NTA", "My mum often asks for craft supplies like die cutters and crochet hooks - just because she then sells her work at craft fairs does not mean I\u2019m entitled to a cut or reimbursement - there\u2019s a difference between a gift and investing in your business.\n\nAs another point, the main thing people are paying for is your time - I can craft things myself with the materials, but I buy things to save time.\n\nDefinitely NTA and congrats on your successful business - it\u2019s all because of you \u2764\ufe0f", "Nta. Never accept anything from this person again. Its sad because that was a very generous & kind thing. She got greedy & resentful & made it ugly. You do not owe her anything. A gift is a gift. She doesnt get to decide what you can do with it. If i buy my daughter a car, i dont get to control where she goes.", "What's the pun", "brilliant response!", "This is a normal person response. It should make their cousin super happy for her. Weird af.", "With their mentality it would probably backfire. \u201cShe\u2019s making money off this stuff because of the machine I gave her!\u201d", "Give it say month or two and leave a small scuff or scratch along the side no way the shop will take it back for full price \ud83d\udc40", "Well, I actually disagree with a lot of people here! YTA because she didn\u2019t realise you were going to make money with a gift she gave you and oh my god what on earth am I saying OF COURSE YOU\u2019RE NTA. The real question is who hurt your cousin that she is this way??", "Yes.", "NTA and also WTF?! most normal people would be happy that you are using the machine that got you as a gift and you are even to make a profit off of it.", "That knitting machine sure did come with a lot of strings attached.", "I say go buy your own and return the one they bought to them instead of giving them the money.", "At this point she should invest some of her earnings into a new machine and return the original to her cousin. Perhaps they can start a business since it\u2019s so easy to do! /s", "Besides being a gift, what did the cousin expect lol? Knitting infinitely for no reason, use it as decoration?", "Cousin *could* just be happy that OP is doing well and she helped with that success.", "I thought the same!", "Yeah I'm half expecting the cousin, cousin's parents, and employer to each come demanding a percentage of the profits.", "Yes, it would just open up OP for her cousin to keep asking her for a share of all current and future earnings from OP. The cousin doesn't deserve a thank you gift back.", "Absolutely. If I gave someone a pen and they'd write a bestseller with it, I'd be proud of them, not demand part of the profits. And explain them what Word is.", "Found the cousin", "NO YOU DONT GIVE IN TO BULLIES.", "Right! While I type this my cricut is cutting names for custom Easter baskets I sold to a friend, but the cricut itself was a birthday gift from my parents. They deserve a cut?!", "And refuse any future gifts from them politely but firmly.", "Well the bully wants profit sharing\n\nGiving her an expensive used machine she probably can't return or use herself will really piss her off and remove all leverage \ud83d\ude02", "The bully wants money, she can't do jackshit with the machine and resale will not cover the initial cost - giving the machine back is the easiest way to make her shut up, since she no longer \"have a part\" on the business.", "No I don't think that would be wise.  They would probably see it as her being \"funny\" because of what is happening now between them.", "Definitely send a belated thank you with a generous gift made from your machine.", "Not weird, greedy.", "Yes what? Why? Come on now. Don\u2019t be shy", "It\u2019s never polite to sell a gift.", "Anyway I only read the title I thought she brought a gift back to the store. \n\nBut I also thought your reaction to my was comment cute. Thank you.", "And here I go down the knitting machine hole in YouTube lol", "I came here to say this!", "Re read the post. She\u2019s not selling the gift. She is using the gift to make goods to sell.", "And brag to everyone who made it to support her cousin's business!", "The best would be buying a new machine to use for the business, and letting the gift machine collect dust in the corner, without giving it back.", "Good luck and godspeed, that hole is deep but at least it's full of soft, plush textiles ... and needles, so many strange needles", "I love this."]}
