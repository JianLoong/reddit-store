I love sewing, knitting, sculpting and so on. Everyone knows this about me and so it always heavily influences what I'm gifted for Christmases and birthdays. This birthday my (26f) cousin bought me a brand new knitting machine, I'd been wanting one for an incredibly long time, although hadn't bought one myself as its a bit of an investment piece. I was really thankful and happy for the gift and I absolutely adore using it. The machine has given me the ability to try many different patterns and make wildly different things with my knitting. Such as crop tops, sweatshirts, beanies, scrunchies, handbags and so on. It took me a little while to get used to the machine and be able to use it to its full potential. Now here's where the problem comes in. I've recently opened a small business where I sell many different craft products many of which are completely funded by myself and have nothing to do with the machine; but my most popular items are often my knitting machine made items, I buy all the wool and yarn myself and make everything by hand with the machine. My cousin recently found out that I use the machine in my business and says it's unfair that i am making money off of a gift they gave to me because I didn't need to invest the money on buying the machine, they did and is demanding I pay her back the full price it cost to buy the machine. I find this extremely unfair as it was their gift to me and I shouldn't be expected to pay them back, especially as all the other materials are paid for by me. I'm really conflicted on what to do because I really don't want drama and am thinking of just paying them back to avoid problems but I feel that I shouldn't need to pay them back because it was a gift in the first place.

It was a gift and you can do whatever you want with it.", "NTA.

Oh heck no. Your cousin is trying to profit off of your ingenuity and hard work. This is one of the moments of your life to learn to stand up for yourself.

If I could share one thing with my 17 year old self, it would be that.\n\nIf helps you could say something like: \"I'm sorry you feel that way. It was a thoughtful gift, and I do appreciate it.

A gift is used however you want it to be used whether it\u2019s getting a great use in your case, or taking up dust in the basement which it would be if it was gifted to me.

The machine was a gift, it is yours to do with what you want. Your cousin cannot expect to give someone a present and afterwards create rules on how you're allowed to use it. The only reason to pay her back imo would be to avoid further clashes (to protect you, not to satisfy her), and then go little or no contact. You said you don't want drama, so maybe think different scenarios through how this may unfold and what is the best way for you. But you should not get bullied into paying if you don't want to, that is your choice. And your cousin should definitely learn that there are consequences to behaviour like that...\n\nOff topic side note: may I ask what machine you have? I've been looking into getting one and am still undecided :) And congrats on the business!", "NTA. Be petty and give her her gift back. You have already decided to pay her the price of machine, so I can assume that you could buy it new yourself. So buy new, and give her machine back. that way you will be severing the cord of future arguments and entitlements of your cousin. \"She wouldn't be where she is now with her business if it weren't me who bought her knitting machine\" , \"I am entitled to some part of your profit because I gave your key machinery\".  She can keep her machine and do whatever she'd want to do with it !!! \n\nPlease don't give her money.
