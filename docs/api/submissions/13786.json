I love sewing, knitting, sculpting and so on. Everyone knows this about me and so it always heavily influences what I'm gifted for Christmases and birthdays. This birthday my (26f) cousin bought me a brand new knitting machine, I'd been wanting one for an incredibly long time, although hadn't bought one myself as its a bit of an investment piece. I was really thankful and happy for the gift and I absolutely adore using it. The machine has given me the ability to try many different patterns and make wildly different things with my knitting. Such as crop tops, sweatshirts, beanies, scrunchies, handbags and so on. It took me a little while to get used to the machine and be able to use it to its full potential. Now here's where the problem comes in. I've recently opened a small business where I sell many different craft products many of which are completely funded by myself and have nothing to do with the machine; but my most popular items are often my knitting machine made items, I buy all the wool and yarn myself and make everything by hand with the machine. My cousin recently found out that I use the machine in my business and says it's unfair that i am making money off of a gift they gave to me because I didn't need to invest the money on buying the machine, they did and is demanding I pay her back the full price it cost to buy the machine. I find this extremely unfair as it was their gift to me and I shouldn't be expected to pay them back, especially as all the other materials are paid for by me. I'm really conflicted on what to do because I really don't want drama and am thinking of just paying them back to avoid problems but I feel that I shouldn't need to pay them back because it was a gift in the first place.

That's ridiculous! They gave you a gift; what you do with it is entirely your business (pun intended).", "NTA. Your cousin is being downright rude! They gave you a gift, and you're making incredible use of it! They should be happy that you use their gift so well.\n\nDon't you dare pay them back, they gave you a GIFT, not an obligation.\n\nGrats on having a successful business - fiber arts are a difficult one to make a profit off of.", "NTA. Is this for real? You\u2019re using a tool to create products, the machine itself isn\u2019t generating value. You\u2019re using it to produce. I\u2019m asking if it\u2019s real because it\u2019s otherwise embarrassing that a 26-year-old doesn\u2019t understand that this concept.\n\nIf someone gifts you a bike, can they then demand a cut when your do paper routes?\n\nIf someone gifts you a hammer, can they demand a room for when you build a house with it?\n\nThe only time you can demand something is usually when you have access to grant some the resources they need to accomplish something, which this is, but that is only acceptable if the person makes that part of the deal. Like if they had straight up said, \u201cim not going to give you this. But I will buy it, and if you make a profit I want you to pay it off with a 10% interest\u201d. At that point, however, it is not a gift.", "NTA a gift is a gift, no take-backs, no refunds, no debts owed\n\nDo not pay them back, otherwise next it will be \u201cyou owe me % cut of everything you make because I inspired you\u201d nonsense\n\nYour cousin is taking the piss, do not reward them", "NTA. Cousin is the one being ridiculous", "NTA! I can't believe your cousin thinks that if you give someone a gift they can't get any financial profit from it! If I am given a bike and cycle to work, do I have to pay them back for the bike? Or if I get given a really nice pen and use it to take notes in a meeting or sign a contract, do I pay them back? Or get given a book on medieval druids which inspires me to write a best-selling fantasy series, do I have to give them a percentage of the profits? WTF?", "NTA. It was a gift and you can do whatever you want with it.", "NTA. But if I were you I would absolutely give them back the cost of the machine (not because I think you owe them, but so they can never claim to have any of your stuff ever) then never speak to them or have anything to do with them again.", "Nta. Oh heck no. Your cousin is trying to profit off of your ingenuity and hard work. This is one of the moments of your life to learn to stand up for yourself. You can be appreciative of something and still hold your ground. You can be compassionate toward whatever your cousin is experiencing without having to sacrifice yourself. If I could share one thing with my 17 year old self, it would be that.\n\nIf helps you could say something like: \"I'm sorry you feel that way. It was a thoughtful gift, and I do appreciate it. But it was a birthday gift, not a business loan.\"", "NTA. Your cousin sucks. It was a gift, it's yours to do as you see fit. If you were my cousin I'd be so happy you get so much use out of it and could make yourself money that I would feel zero entitlement to.", "NTA it was a gift. A gift is used however you want it to be used whether it\u2019s getting a great use in your case, or taking up dust in the basement which it would be if it was gifted to me. Your cousin is the AH for even suggesting this. They just hate that you\u2019ve turned their gift into profits so they think they\u2019re entitled. Newsflash they aren\u2019t.", "NTA. They gave you a gift and its up to you what you use it foe. Fron the title i thought you sold or pawned the gift off or something. if she gifted you a crochet kit and knitting needles instead of a machine and you started a business making stuff by hand would she charge you for that too?", "NTA, and given such a peculiar starting point I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s anything you can do to fix the relationship with your cousin here.\n\nMaybe hold onto it until you\u2019re able to afford your own knitting machine and then give this one back to your cousin, with lots of effusive thanks for their help, and leave them to deal with finding someone else to offload it on.", "NTA. The machine was a gift, it is yours to do with what you want. Your cousin cannot expect to give someone a present and afterwards create rules on how you're allowed to use it. The only reason to pay her back imo would be to avoid further clashes (to protect you, not to satisfy her), and then go little or no contact. You said you don't want drama, so maybe think different scenarios through how this may unfold and what is the best way for you. But you should not get bullied into paying if you don't want to, that is your choice. And your cousin should definitely learn that there are consequences to behaviour like that...\n\nOff topic side note: may I ask what machine you have? I've been looking into getting one and am still undecided :) And congrats on the business!", "NTA. Be petty and give her her gift back. You have already decided to pay her the price of machine, so I can assume that you could buy it new yourself. So buy new, and give her machine back. that way you will be severing the cord of future arguments and entitlements of your cousin. \"She wouldn't be where she is now with her business if it weren't me who bought her knitting machine\" , \"I am entitled to some part of your profit because I gave your key machinery\".  She can keep her machine and do whatever she'd want to do with it !!! \n\nPlease don't give her money. You'd always be attached with her entitlement around your knitting business if you do so.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your cousin is delusional. \n\nYes, they facilitated your ability to earn money, however, besides a Thankyou they are owed nothing. \n\nIf you were nice you can make them an item, however, I think that point has passed due to their behaviour and they can look from afar with their jealousy keeping them warm. \n\nAlso, if it\u2019s a gift they can\u2019t request it back, not even Judge Judy will force a return of an item that was gifted.", "NTA. Holy moly! Your cousin sounds positively horrid! Because I\u2019m a petty a-hole myself, I\u2019d return the machine as soon as I possibly could and buy a better one with my own money.

Wtf is wrong with your cousin", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t accept anything from that person ever again! This is weird behavior!", "NTA.\n\n If you wanted to be nice you could of before they complained gave them something nice you used with the machine.\n\n\nNow, after the complaining, I wouldn't.

NTA", "Agreed. \n\nCousin gave OP a gift, they didn't become an investor in their future business they didn't know would exist.", "Hell if OP can afford it, they should just return the gifted machine and OP can buy a new one for themselves.
