That she had sit like a fool by herself. I told her I am so sorry I missed it but a patient of mine died and that if she can give me some peace we would talk about it in the morning. She became even angrier screaming at me that I never take her out ( I do my best to take her out every week but sometimes I would need to cancel because of work and these are not lavish dates). Again I told her I am sorry but please let me be as I am having a splitting headache. \n\nBut she would not shut up for an hour she was screaming and cursing at me while I was trying to eat doing my best to block her out. I snapped when she banged the table causing my cup to fall down and spill.

Why are you with her?", "INFO What does she bring to the relationship?", "NTA. Break up for your and her sanity. Unfortunately, healthcare workers' dating pool is narrower as the other person needs to accept that situations like you describe happen. Also, shifts can overrun, colleagues call off sick etc. It is similar with working away (trucking, oil rigs, military etc). It is just not for everyone.", "NTA- i would ask yourself why are you with her? if my man provided for me and took me out on dates i would not react this way.. hell i would not have acted that way anyway. the moment i found out you had to skip because you had to deal with that i would have gone into care mode. she should have supported you and some quite time was the least of it. you did yell yes but she was following you and yelling.", "NTA. Your GF is unemployed, sponging off you, and you were late because *a child in your care died.* And she's angry at you?\n\nIf I were you I'd find a different GF.", "NTA. I worry for you if you actually think you could be the asshole here. This tale is really a barometer for who is actually considering you/your mental health v. whatever.", "NTA. \nI dont understand why she doesn't work? Especially if yall dont have children? What does she even do all day.\nLiterally just a stay at home girlfriend lolol", "NTA. You deserve better. Her family is what made her to be entitled and devoid of compassion. \n\nI'm sorry for the pain you must endure when you lose a patient - especially a child.", "Nah f off with that sexist shit you don't get to screem and bang on a table for hrs without consequences. She sounds abusive and will get worse if you let her back. I understand being cancelled on is frustrating but imagine you would've much have preferred being at dinner yourself then having a child die on you. She sounds extremely ungrateful and no matter what things won't be good enough for her.", "NTA. So it's ok for her to scream and shout and swear and verbally abuse you, but when you shout back after having a stressful and probably quite traumatic day, you're suddenly the villain. What a load of old rubbish. Do yourself a favour mate, and serve her with an eviction notice.", "INFO: You mentioned many cons of your relationship with her. Is there any good reason you would stay with such a toxic woman?", "NTA. She sounds like she needs to be with someone else.", "NTA. Most people need some down time after work, and I would say especially so for people working in high stress environments. \n\nShe should have held the conversation the next day once you both had a chance to clear your heads, even if for different reasons.", "NTA tell them it\u2019s mutual respect a woman doesn\u2019t have a right to scream and curse at a man and expect no response especially when she continues on and on after you asked her nicely twice, I think you should re-think this relationship she\u2019s also basically freeloading whether you make enough or not isn\u2019t the point, it takes two it\u2019s a team effort and she\u2019s giving none", "Nta. You should rethink this relationship if she's going to be not only abusive but spoiled and entitled.  You haven't even been together that long and it's only going to get worse.", "NTA- pack up her shit and leave it outside for when she gets back. Get this abusive deadbeat out of your life.\n\nYou don't have a girlfriend you have a parasite. She'll slowly take everything from you until you have nothing left to give. And once she can't get anything else from you she'll move onto her next host. You don't deserve this, no one deserves it.", "She pushed you to your limit and you snapped. It\u2019s never ideal to snap, but NTA because we can only take so much. However she\u2019s a major AH and you should break up with her good lord.", "I was going to say YTA because there\u2019s never an appropriate time to tell your SO to STFU. However, it turns out there is, and she found it. Therefore, NTA and cut the selfish freeloader loose.", "NTA. You had an awful day only to come home to someone that seems to think only about her reputation at that moment. \nYou tried multiple times to solve it, but to no reveal. \nShould you have yelled? No. Is it very understandable you did (and did she kinda deserve it at that point): yes.\n\nHope you're feeling better.", "Definitely NTA. She\u2019s really toxic and very self centered. It doesn\u2019t take much to sympathize and understand the stress someone is going through, especially in a healthcare setting. *And* she\u2019s unemployed acting like that? She should be grateful and lucky to have someone to financially support her.", "NTA\n\nHonestly from the way she sounds. Even if she is 27 years old she sounds about his mature as a teenager. She needs to grow up and get over herself.\n\nPeople talk about equality nowadays but equality doesn't mean letting your significant other blatantly abuse you and get away with it. You put up with it tried to let her say her piece and she took it too far. You were completely in the right.\n\nFor clarity I'm a 31-year-old male.", "NTA. I could understand why she was upset if she didn't know the reason, but you told her. She should have been more understanding.", "NTA.\n\nShe lacks any type of compassion, and frankly she sounds like a freeloader.", "NTA but FFS she's entitled dead weight in this relationship. Cut her loose.", "NTA I was honestly gonna start with YTA for the listed reason but after that shit she deserved put in her place. Time for you to dump her and find a woman of higher standard.", "It appears she doesn't care about you or your feelings and only with you for your money. \n\ndump her and find someone that has compassion for you", "NTA. She didn't let up. It sounds like you reached the end of your tether. It was incredibly cruel of her to keep at you even after being advised of the circumstances. I find it hard to believe that the people who she had dinner with wouldn't understand.", "NTA, she sounds like an entitled brat", "NTA.  \n\nEveryone has a limit and you tried your best to block her but she was determined to get under your skin.  This is not healthy.\n\nIf things continue on this path it will eventually escalate either on your part or hers.  That is not good.  Fortunately you two are not married and no kids are involved.  Maybe it is time she moves back with her family.  You sound like you need some time to yourself anyway.", "NTA and she doesn\u2019t sound like a person who can support the downs of your profession.", "NTA. Doesn't matter that she's the fucking woman, I don't give a fuck. That is cruel.", "NTA.\n\nAlso. If she\u2019s already complaining you never romance me anymore, after a year, it\u2019s probably time for both of you to find someone more compatible. \n\nAdditionally. Her parents might have only heard her version which was you cancelled because of work, said you do this frequently, and then yelled at her when she was only trying to communicate with you.\n\nThere are many questions that could be asked for a deeper dive into this relationship, but for the posted question, she knows your line of work and has no respect for it. Not many people can handle that line of work mentally and she was making it worse. Shutting the fuck up was best for her as well, so definitely no need to beat yourself up over this one.", "NTA. She ain\u2019t for you. If she can\u2019t understand that someone dying is more important that a night out just shows that she is very selfish. Too selfish to be a partner. Think about it.", "NTA.\n\nBro, you're both wrong for each other, please get out of that toxicity. No relationship should have people screaming at each other and disrespecting the need for space after a rough day. Understanding and calm communication is what you need, and this is not what you're gonna get in this current relationship.
