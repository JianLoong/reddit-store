She sounds extremely ungrateful and no matter what things won't be good enough for her.", "NTA.

Time for you to dump her and find a woman of higher standard.", "It appears she doesn't care about you or your feelings and only with you for your money. \n\ndump her and find someone that has compassion for you", "NTA. She didn't let up. It sounds like you reached the end of your tether. It was incredibly cruel of her to keep at you even after being advised of the circumstances. I find it hard to believe that the people who she had dinner with wouldn't understand.", "NTA, she sounds like an entitled brat", "NTA.  \n\nEveryone has a limit and you tried your best to block her but she was determined to get under your skin.  This is not healthy.\n\nIf things continue on this path it will eventually escalate either on your part or hers.  That is not good.  Fortunately you two are not married and no kids are involved.

Her parents might have only heard her version which was you cancelled because of work, said you do this frequently, and then yelled at her when she was only trying to communicate with you.\n\nThere are many questions that could be asked for a deeper dive into this relationship, but for the posted question, she knows your line of work and has no respect for it. Not many people can handle that line of work mentally and she was making it worse. Shutting the fuck up was best for her as well, so definitely no need to beat yourself up over this one.", "NTA. She ain\u2019t for you. If she can\u2019t understand that someone dying is more important that a night out just shows that she is very selfish. Too selfish to be a partner. Think about it.", "NTA.\n\nBro, you're both wrong for each other, please get out of that toxicity.

If so NTA, if no ESH", "NTA she screamed at you for an hour, after you told her your patient died.  F her.    \nAlso you've only been together a year, she's living with you for free and you pay for everything?  Hell I'd change the locks while she's gone.  She can go stay with her family.", "NTA and I would be done with her, she is clearly lined up to be a stay at home kept woman.  She wants a doctor husband so she doesn't have to work.\n\nShe has also just shown what make the difference between a good doctor and a great doctor, empathy!  She doesn't have it.", "I am a woman. That woman deserves to get yelled at. That woman deserves to get dumped and thrown out on her unemployed mooching self centered princess ass. NTA", "NTA. Read through to ensure , you are NTA. Holy cow kick that cow out and bring some peace to your life", "Have you considered popping the question?\n\nIn all seriousness though, she sounds awful.\n\nNTA.", "No man, you need to get out of this because people like this only get worse. She sounds like my mom, who would scream all night. My dad pleaded with her to be quiet, but she just refused\u2026.then she slept all day long, ot till she felt like getting up.\n\nThis girl has a personality disorder, and no compassion. If she had any compassion, empathy, or even sympathy she would ask about the child. Man, you just told her a CHILD DIED, and it\u2019s still ALL ABOUT HER??? Run, she is selfish and will never care about anything but how things should \u201clook\u201d to others. That doesn\u2019t matter at all, life and death, and she is not phased or affected at all. This is SICK the way she is reacting!", "NTA. What her friends said would be true if your intent was to intimidate her, but it was a response to her constantly hounding you, even after you told her about a traumatic event which occurred earlier.", "Oh fuck that!!\n\nMy mom was a nurse for 30+ years. She has seen more then her share of death. Most times she was fine with it but sometimes she wasn't. \n\nMy dad worked nights so during the week it was just me, my mom and younger brother. \n\nKnow what we did when she was upset about a patient? \n\nWe gave her space and figured out shit on our own. Keep in mind, Me and my brother where under 12 at this time. \n\nThen in the morning my dad would get up early to make sure we got off to school ok. \n\nNTA \n\nBut you may want to rethink your gf situation.", "NTA.\n\nAnd DROP HER LIKE A BAD HABIT.\n\nShe's a compassionless WRETCH.", "NTA. I mean, if she sat there and didn\u2019t hear a thing from you until you got home, yeah I understand being upset. (Not an hour long tantrum, though). If you had texted and said you weren\u2019t coming, that\u2019s different. Either way, this situation isn\u2019t tenable. You can\u2019t be her only source of income, entertainment, and meaning. And frankly, this relationship isn\u2019t really long enough to be supporting her.", "NTA so very sorry on the loss of your patient. You should get a new gf. One that works. Not because she \"needs\" to but, because she wants to be productive.", "> My gf on the other hand is living with me and is unemployed which I don\u2019t mind as I make enough money for both of us. \n\nThis was your first mistake. Stop being a \"nice guy\".\n\n> I snapped and yelled at her to shut the fuck up and how fucking cruel and stupid she was to not understand that everything and everyone doesn\u2019t revolve around her.\nReasonable.\n\n> Now I\u2019m getting calls from her family saying that as a man no matter what the woman does you should never yell at her.\nHave you explained them the situation? If they don't understand at that point, tell them to fuck off (in a polite manner). \n\n\u200bNTA.\n\nYour gf is living off your money and she complains about you not being able to come because of work? And doesn't even recognize what happened? The fuck. \n\nTODO: Tell your gf how you felt after she reacted to you like that. If she doesn't apologize or show compassion in any way, seriously reconsider your relationship. Why would you invest time with sb like that?", "NTA your family can shove it - a kid died on your shift and that shit has impact.\n\nAlso, that's false. You are absolutely allowed to yell at and strike women if you are being attacked. In this instance, you matched her level of aggression to assert your point. And express anger - totally a normal thing.\n\nI'm shocked she knows you work in healthcare and can't bring herself to understand death can be traumatizing.\n\nThis woman has been with you 1 year, lives off your wage, complains you don't take her out when you do, and won't let you process the death of a child while on the clock.\n\nRead the last bit again, and consider if you want to still be dating her in one year.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole for yelling at her, but did you have to use the F bomb?", "Yes.  YTA", "NTA. My wife (I am also female) is in the healthcare field and I also don\u2019t work because she makes enough that I don\u2019t have to and sometimes she is late and sometimes stressed because of a patient or work politics and I would never ever do that to her.  That was very immature of your gf. Could you have handled it differently? Yes. But being with someone in the healthcare field is hard and you to have a very understanding partner or it\u2019s never going to work.", "Seriously. she contributes nothing, and acts entitled to your time and money", "> that allows her to sit on her ass at home\n\nHonestly this is the problem. He works and she sits at home rotting her mind and growing bored, then she starts stupid fights HE doesn't take her out enough when he has a terribly unequal level of tiredness to her... because he is the only one working so they can pay rent.\n\nHumans really aren't that far off high-energy dogs. If left at home alone with nothing to do they become destructive. They need work, of some sort.\n\nIt sounds like she'd be happier with a boyfriend equally unemployed and available for dinners every night. How they're going to pay for those dinners, well, I doubt details like that are her strong point.", "Honestly wonder what the family's response would have been if he had explained the circumstances. \n\n\"I'm sorry I could not go on a date with your daughter because I had to explain how someone else's daughter just died.\"", "This is a great article. DTMFA", "Missing the mark on that stress relieving if this post is any indication", "I was assuming on OTHER nights... LOL", "I also can't believe her family yelled at him. Christ on a cracker."]}
