She sounds extremely ungrateful and no matter what things won't be good enough for her.", "NTA.

Time for you to dump her and find a woman of higher standard.", "It appears she doesn't care about you or your feelings and only with you for your money. \n\ndump her and find someone that has compassion for you", "NTA. She didn't let up. It sounds like you reached the end of your tether. It was incredibly cruel of her to keep at you even after being advised of the circumstances. I find it hard to believe that the people who she had dinner with wouldn't understand.", "NTA, she sounds like an entitled brat", "NTA.  \n\nEveryone has a limit and you tried your best to block her but she was determined to get under your skin.  This is not healthy.\n\nIf things continue on this path it will eventually escalate either on your part or hers.  That is not good.  Fortunately you two are not married and no kids are involved.

Her parents might have only heard her version which was you cancelled because of work, said you do this frequently, and then yelled at her when she was only trying to communicate with you.\n\nThere are many questions that could be asked for a deeper dive into this relationship, but for the posted question, she knows your line of work and has no respect for it. Not many people can handle that line of work mentally and she was making it worse. Shutting the fuck up was best for her as well, so definitely no need to beat yourself up over this one.", "NTA. She ain\u2019t for you. If she can\u2019t understand that someone dying is more important that a night out just shows that she is very selfish. Too selfish to be a partner. Think about it.", "NTA.\n\nBro, you're both wrong for each other, please get out of that toxicity.

That sucks.  A lot. You have my sympathy because sometimes things go to hell no matter how hard you try. \n\nYour girlfriend couldn't give a shit about it because it screwed up her plans of having a nice night out with her boyfriend. Your girlfriend who doesn't have a job because apparently you pay for everything. \n\nObviously, you're NTA. \n\nBut where do you see this going long term? Is she super hot? Is she amazing in bed? Does she check off some \"healthcare sector\" trophy gf box?

If you want that, have at it.\n\nI'm not asking this to be a jerk, but I am genuinely curious why you would want to be with someone who is so selfish that she can't fathom why you had a bad day when you lost a child.

In your career, there are going to be many times you're going to have to cancel on her.  This won't be your last tragedy either.\n\nIf she wants a more present partner, she's going to have to find someone else - and get a full time job, because if he always only has to work 9 to 5, he's almost definitely not going to be making enough money to support both of them.", "NTA.

If she was just frustrated, the first instant before she knew why you missed the dinner, and yelled or rose her voice for like 30 seconds, i could maybe understand where she is coming from. But for you to tell her and for her to continue fucking yelling and banging the table?? Thats abuse. No excuse about it. It is emotionally draining you and instead of comforting you after losing a patient if she is so self involved and berating you you have to take a look at the bigger picture. Do you want someone like this in your house? An unsupportive, apathetic, cold person like her? This isnt a compatible relationship.

OP is nta because he was just decompressing. This isnt apathy. It would be apathy if he left while she was yelling at him. It would have been apathy if he went to a bar right after work to drown out the pain. But in this moment he did have empathy for her.
