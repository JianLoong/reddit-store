It\u2019s crazy to me that after a year she suddenly now wants you to change your style. I also don\u2019t think your an asshole for mentioning her pitching in, if she wants only fancy places then she should be pitching in. \n\nIf anything, she should have never bought clothes without consulting you first.", "ESH. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t demand to change your style or bring up her ex. She should have probably bought you a nice shirt or two she\u2019d think you\u2019d look nice in if she wanted to expand your style.\n\nBut you are also rude. She went out of her way to buy you nice clothes and they\u2019re still sitting in bags in your closet? Did you even try them on for her? You could have at the very least hung them in your closet.\n\nAnother commentator said this but seeing your GF is a nice occasion. You should at least wear them out with her. \n\nI remember when my now husband wore cargo pants when we first met. As a \u201cfashion girlie\u201d, i would cringe whenever I saw them on (but I loved him and pants are pants). I didn\u2019t try to get rid of them, but every so often I\u2019d try out different styles of pants for him that were more elevated. Eventually he found the types of pants he loved. Ten years later and he doesn\u2019t own cargo pants anymore because he learned to elevate his style this way. I\u2019m happy and he\u2019s happy with better style.", "ESH. You should at least wear the clothes when you see her, as seeing the woman you love is a special occasion, even if it is daily.\n\n>there's no reason for me to get home from a day of work all dirty and get into slacks and a blazer\n\nIf you're alone, of course, but if you expect her to visit or go out with her, putting on nice clothes seems like a common courtesy.\n\nHowever, pulling the ex card is way out of line.", "YTA. Look bro, I know its not your style but you could have at least just hung them up in the closet and when she asked said that you just hadn't found a good time/reason to wear them. This was the perfect opportunity to buy her alot of super sexy nightwear, teddies, thongs, sexy bedroom costumes etc....but honey, you never wear the handcuffs I got you and when's the last time you wore the naughty nurse lingerie??  I had a similar thing happen and got her a whole pegging \"outfit\" for her in case she wanted me to wear a old man onesie she got me (red with the buttoned butt flap) I really thought it was a funny response. So far she hasnt forced me to wear it. That just might backfire on me someday as she occasionally gives me the funniest look.......", "THIS."]}
