We stayed civil with each other, mostly because we actually don't interact that much so there's no room for fights since we just don't see often. Until now. \n\nShe's getting married in a couple of days, and my BIL asked me for something a week ago: a cake. I do cakes and sell them, but not to living, just so I can get a little bit more of money to pay my college, so I don't have experience doing such big cakes for big events. \nBIL told me it's not a big wedding, so I don't have to worry, it's a decently sized cake for at least 80 people. Still big but something I can manage. So I said yes. \n\nI sent Clara a message asking for specifications and she replied with screenshots of cakes from pinterest. Nothing more. I had to push her further so she can give me exact ideas for the cake since all her replies to my questions were \"It's literally in the images I sent, can't you see?\" Whatever.\nDays passed and I sent her a quick sketch of the cake and she didn't replied.\nOther day passed and I sent a image of all the things I bought for the cake so she can tell me if that's the things she asked for, but again, nothing.\n\nSo, I then told her how much it would cost the cake and that if she can please pay me the half now, so she can pay the other half later.\nAnd this time I did got an answer. A call. \nShe was fuming and demanding an explanation of why I'm charging her for the cake, practically yelling at me. \nI was confused by her reaction, and I had to explain to her that it's literally my job, and that I already bought all the things for her cake so all I'm asking is for the half of the payment. \nShe said that how I DARE to charge her for a cake for her special day, that family does things for eachother without expecting something back, and more BS like that.\n\nLong story short: she's not paying for shit, and she made sure to let it very clear that she's not giving me a single penny.\n\nYesterday she called me again and asked me how is her cake going. I told her I'm not doing anything since she's not paying, so if she wants a cake she can ask someone else.\nShe yelled and cried, saying I'm a selfish bitch, that I don't care about her and there's no time for her to get another person, so to please stop being a bitch and help her out. \nI laughed at her and hung up. Later, my dad called and told me that I'm an asshole for laughing at Clara when she's in distress, and that just make a stupid cake so she can stop complaining about me. \n\nI admit, I actually CAN do her cake since I already have the things, so that let me thinking that, well, maybe I'm being a salty asshole. I can do her cake, I have the things already bought and her sketch made, so I don't loose anything\nMy mom told me the exact same, and I'm genuinely starting to thing that I might be an asshole here. \n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1687753373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14j6z6n/aita_for_not_wanting_to_do_a_cake_for_my/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I did arrange a fee for those events. I\u2019m saying NTA. I definitely wouldn\u2019t do it for free. See if you can meet her for coffee and compromise that she pays for the cost of the materials you already bought. Offer the rest as a wedding present? That\u2019s only if the guilt is eating you and you\u2019re a people pleaser like me. Otherwise, no cake.

Make the cake, deliver it, and then give some money back as a gift if you want, but I wouldn\u2019t bother.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter though.  This woman will never be happy with you.  You can probably use most of the dry ingredients for later cakes.
