For some context, I'm 6'0\" and 150 pounds, so I'm a thin guy. I always use the seat, and if a toilet doesn't have a seat, I hover because I will straight up fall into a toilet if I'm not careful. \n\nMy partner, however, is 6'0\" and 280 pounds. I don't consider her fat. I never think of her as fat. And I'm always trying to tell her how good she looks. I've never been a not thin guy and I know people who are larger than me tend to use the toilet sans seat, and sit on the rim of the bowl. In all our four years together, I've never taken note of how she uses the toilet so I asked her:\n\n\"Do you use the toilet with the seat up or the seat down?\" She was confused at first and I should've deduced the answer from that but I'm a little stupid.\n\nAfter explaining my question in more detail, she asked if I was calling her fat. Of course, I replied with \"no\" and explained it wasn't about weight, I just wanted to be sure the toilet freshener wouldn't keep her from using the toilet. She was offended anyways and I felt at the time that it was a bit unreasonable to feel that way. We had a bit of back and forth regarding that and agreed to disagree.\n\nThat was yesterday. Today, she brought it up again and I told her that I maintain my question was not about her being fat or not and that it was only because I wanted to make sure she wasn't going to be disrupted by the toilet freshener. She called me an asshole for defending my question and doesn't believe that my question was not about her weight. \n\nShe asked if I was sorry at all and I told her, honestly, \"no\". I don't feel like I've done anything wrong or that I was being rude. She called me an asshole again and stormed off. I'm left here at my desk starting to wonder if I AM an asshole.\n\nI should have just apologized and typically I do but I really felt like I didn't do anything wrong. My apology wouldn't have been a lie, I AM sorry that I've upset her. But on the topic of AITAH I'm not so sure anymore. \n\n\nThe stakes on this are super low, btw. I'm trying to figure out if I'm missing a perspective here that makes me an asshole. We'll talk about it tonight, no doubt, and go to bed happy with each other. We don't ever really fight and rarely disagree so I figured \"why not let Reddit weigh in?\" \n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\nNSFW because mentions of toilets? Idk.\n\n----------------------- \n\nEdit to add:\n\n\nSo here's what I've learned today:\n\nA) I have a very strange family. \n\nB) I failed to realize that I was making an assumption based on very limited data. The assumption being that some people don't use the toilet seat and the data limited to the maybe 15 people I've ever witnessed using the restroom in 24 years of life. \n\nC) I am, in fact, very sorry to my girlfriend for being such a naive ass and asking what I now realize was a profoundly stupid question. \n\nIn all, I'm glad to have posted here. In the future, I'll carefully consider exactly /why/ I think something is true and on what data I base that belief. I talked with my girlfriend, laid it all out, and decided to take my lumps, though she offered none. We had a good talk and she and I are back to playing Factorio and Baldur's Gate 3 respectively :).", "created_utc": 1691441607, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15kwqnk/aita_for_asking_my_partner_if_she_sits_on_the/", "score": 482, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that this came to your mind *did* have to do with her size and, even though you don't consider her fat, your question was motivated by her size and definitely hit her the wrong way.\n\nWhat you need to do now is sit with her and, yes, apologize.  Even if you felt you did nothing wrong, you should still apologize because your words, even though offered with no malicious intent, did hurt her feelings.  Explain to her your misconception, that you thought that toilet seats were there for skinny folks and you were concerned for her comfort.  Tell her you are an idiot for believing that, and that you meant no disrespect and are deeply sorry that you hurt her.  Tell her you never saw her that way and your own naivety led you to ask a hurtful question.\n\nSo I'm not ready to call you the AH, but you did hurt her feelings and need to be sympathetic to that.", "YTA nobody sits on the rim lmao where did you read that?
