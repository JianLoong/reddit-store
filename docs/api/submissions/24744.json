If so, you may want to grow fewer plants or move your operations indoors. \n\nPart of living with a neighborhood is knowing you have neighbors - and that goes both ways. You tolerate a little bit of them being annoying, but you also constrain yourself slightly so you don't annoy them as much as you might otherwise have.", "Why would you give half a shit about what they think about what you are doing on your property.

You're also legally allowed to burn a leaf pile even if it's driving smoke into your neighbors bedroom. \n\nMy family lives next to a house growing and the smell is non-stop in their bedroom for 1-2 months each summer. If you're not a weed smoker it sucks. Like living next to a brewery would suck. \n\nThat said, again, you're allowed to. Maybe try one of those cheap pop up greenhouses and see if it contains the smell.", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re legally allowed to grow, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for doing so, but I suspect from some of your comments that you\u2019ve become desensitized to the smell. My husband and I grew 4 plants a few years ago, and the smell was strong. Our neighbors didn\u2019t complain, but I\u2019d be surprised if they couldn\u2019t smell it. It was one of the reasons we decided not to grow any more after that.", "Technically, NTA, but I would be annoyed as shit with you.", "Is it legal? According to you, yes. Are you still an AH? Also yes. That shit stinks more than you think it does, especially to non-smokers. If it has a skunky smell to you, as a smoker, I can tell you that it positively reeks to a non-smoker.

What does having a 12 year old have to do with you legally growing weed? It sounds like they're trying to use the fact that they have a kid to manipulate you into doing what they want.\n\nHowever, it's understandable that they wouldn't be happy with the smell. You could make an effort on your end to mask the smell so it isn't as skunky. Try planting good-smelling plants like jasmine, lilac, lavender, thyme, mint, and basil.", "Gonna go against the grain here and say YTA. Sure, what you're doing is legal, so everything is fine and dandy on that front.\n\nNevertheless, that smell can become obnoxious really fast. Imagine having to smell something that isn't enjoyable to you every time you enter your garden. Soon, you won't use your garden anymore which is an actual detriment.\n\nGive it some effort to find a compromise here. E.g. relocate the plants to another area of your garden where it won't be a nuisance or maybe build a little greenhouse out of posts and tarp which at least would contain the smell somewhat. I'm sure, you can think of a solution here.", "YTA\nIf it really does stink that much that neighbours across the street can smell it without seeing it then it stinks. It matters not that it\u2019s legal, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not an ah thing to impose on your neighbours. The fact it\u2019s weed is irrelevant, it could just as easily be any permanent stenchy thing.", "In this case A stands for Addict", "YTA.\n\nWeed smell sticks to everything.
