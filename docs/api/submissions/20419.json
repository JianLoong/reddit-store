I didn\u2019t tell anybody for the longest time until my best friend who I\u2019ll call cody started to notice something was different. After some poking and prodding I finally told him what happened and him.  Codys mom refused to let me stay on the streets and took me into their home. She\u2019s treated me like a son and now I see them as family! Cody\u2019s dad passed away years ago so it was just Cody, me , his mom, and his little sister. I spend holidays with them and go to their family gatherings. Although I was never legally adopted everybody has welcomed me into their family with open arms and I couldn\u2019t be anymore thankful. \nNow at present day I\u2019ve been seeing my gf Stacy (24f) for roughly 6 months. We were hanging out at my apartment watching movies when a text popped up from Cody\u2019s sister Jen (13f). Stacy started getting upset and saying how inappropriate it is for me to be texting a 13 year old girl. I yelled back that she\u2019s not just a 13 year old girl she\u2019s basically my sister! I\u2019ve lived with her since she was 7 and knew her when she was a baby. This argument went back and forth for a few minutes before I told her she needs to get out. She grabbed her stuff and stormed out but not before calling me a pervert and slamming my door. That was a few days ago and we haven\u2019t spoken since.

I mean it would only be inappropriate if the content of the texts was inappropriate.", "NTA-You have a fraternal relationship with her. She\u2019s family. It\u2019s no different then your best friend texting her.", "NTA, I really do wonder where your (ex?) Gf got the idea that texting with underage family is inappropriate from. Is her family exceptionally religious?", "NTA, she\u2019s basically a younger sister to you, and Stacy needs to get over herself.", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with innocently texting a 13 year old family friend.", "NTA. What are you supposed to do - ignore all younger relatives of the opposite sex until they turn 18?", "NTA - The GF is no loss if she is jealous over your little foster sister. I wish you the best in finding a better partner.", "NTA. actually your girlfriend did you a favor by showing you who she is now. The fact that she\u2019s jealous of a 13-year-old is crazy.  \nit\u2019s not inappropriate unless you were being nasty in text.  it\u2019s same as texting ur friend.", "NTA and your girlfriend is basically saying you are a creep. Which does not bode well for this relationship", "NTA! \nIt's so nice when the trash makes it's presence known and takes itself out! The \"ex\" is the TA for trying to corrupt and diminish a HEALTHY sibling relationship.\n\nWhen she walked out the door in a huff, I would have said, \"Bye Felicia. Don't let the door hit ya where to Good Lord split ya.\"", "NTA. She does not acknowledge your family, so much so that she thinks youd like to fuck your sister. Do you really want to be with her? Thats twisted af", "NTA\n\nYou can text relatives for crying out loud.", "You friend's sister texted you about food. You gf was just looking for something to get upset about. NTA and consider this her gift to you so that you can have a future with less childish drama.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all it\u2019s completely appropriate for you to be texting your family, and she\u2019s your family. \n\nYour GF has serious jealousy issues. You need to consider what your future is with her if she thinks this way.", "Lord for fucking bid kids these days need some support. Fuck your hopefully Ex", "What did she text you?", "What was the text? If inappropriate in some way then yeah but if it was hey what should I get Cody for his birthday then NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
