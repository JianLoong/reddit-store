I didn\u2019t tell anybody for the longest time until my best friend who I\u2019ll call cody started to notice something was different. After some poking and prodding I finally told him what happened and him.  Codys mom refused to let me stay on the streets and took me into their home. She\u2019s treated me like a son and now I see them as family! Cody\u2019s dad passed away years ago so it was just Cody, me , his mom, and his little sister. I spend holidays with them and go to their family gatherings. Although I was never legally adopted everybody has welcomed me into their family with open arms and I couldn\u2019t be anymore thankful. \nNow at present day I\u2019ve been seeing my gf Stacy (24f) for roughly 6 months. We were hanging out at my apartment watching movies when a text popped up from Cody\u2019s sister Jen (13f). Stacy started getting upset and saying how inappropriate it is for me to be texting a 13 year old girl. I yelled back that she\u2019s not just a 13 year old girl she\u2019s basically my sister! I\u2019ve lived with her since she was 7 and knew her when she was a baby. This argument went back and forth for a few minutes before I told her she needs to get out. She grabbed her stuff and stormed out but not before calling me a pervert and slamming my door. That was a few days ago and we haven\u2019t spoken since.
