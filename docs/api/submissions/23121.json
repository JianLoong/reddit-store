Once she got engaged she messaged me and told me approximately when she is thinking of getting married and the location. \n\nUnfortunately the wedding date coincides with when I think I maybe heavily pregnant or I may have a newborn baby (my partner and I want to start a family straight after we get married). Her wedding location is also about 7 hours away in another country so would require some serious travel. \n\nAs soon as she messaged me I rang her (she lives about 2 hours away and my schedule is hectic at the moment as I planning my own wedding so I didn't have time to tell her face to face, which in hindsight would have been better). I called her and told her that although I would love to be a bridesmaid I am more than likely going to be pregnant or have a newborn baby at the time of her wedding, so I don't think I can commit to being a bridesmaid as I may have to back out of the wedding at short notice. \n\nShe took this news very badly- she was trying to interrupt me on the call and then when I asked her 'how the wedding planning was going' she said it's all going to shit and then she hung up. She hasn't spoken to me in nearly 2 months.\n\nAs a side note she has constantly stated how much she hates surprises, has a tight budget and she likes to plan things in advance.

Or just planning to be pregnant in \u2026 idk a years time. ?", "Dear op, I think your enthusiasm took over... A pregnacy lasts 9 months, you could wait to become pregnant and then inform your friend, still many months in advance. Pregnacy is something that can't be timelined or planned easily. Her wedding may come and you are not pregnant or you are a couple months pregnant. And all this would have been for nothing. No one is the AH here, but you should communicate better. I wish you good luck with your friend and your pregnacy plans", "YTA \u2014 I think you are vastly overestimating the predictably of the pregnancy timeline. Some people take 1-2 years of trying, some people take 6 months, and some immediately. It was very premature to completely refuse for this reason", "i asked a long time friend to be my bridesmaid she declined and i accepted it.  I was a bit sad but put on my big girl pants and moved on..Then my maid of honour started trying for a baby i jokingly said you cant be due between x and y date she ended up being due 3 days after the wedding but god love her she made it and managed all of her duties despite being in the early stages of labour on the actual day along with this another of my bridesmaids and myself were significantly pregnant for the very catholic wedding.  It was a running joke and tbh fretting about moh's contractions took my mind off stressing about silly things.", "YTA. You may get pregnant the minute you try, it may take a year, or it might not happen at all. You have no idea. Yes, tell her that you are planning to try to get pregnant and that you may need to adjust plans if it happens, but to flat out refuse to be a part of the wedding because you HOPE you\u2019ll get pregnant is an asshole move. This is obviously a very important thing to her and you not participating because of a fantasy pregnancy is very self centered. Are you even friends?", "YTA. You should have ecstatically agreed to be her bridesmaid and then when you (hopefully) become pregnant you can then back out and be devastated you'll miss her special day. \n\nUnless there are other reasons you don't actually want to be a bridesmaid and this is a cover story. Money? Distance? Responsibility?", "Soft yta. You\u2019ve pretty much bailed on your best friend of 10 years when you\u2019re not even pregnant. You could have tentatively accepted but informed her that you would be trying. I really do hope you get pregnant right away but unfortunately for a lot of the time it can take months or even years to conceive. I think you\u2019ve jumped the gun on this and possibly hampered your relationship with your friend. I know you think you were trying to do her a favour by bailing now but I would be very disappointed in you as a friend for not even seeing how things went. You\u2019re putting a lot of pressure on yourself to conceive in time as well, it\u2019s going to be awkward if it gets to her wedding and you\u2019re not pregnant so it was all for nothing. Poorly handled.", "YTA-\n\n>she was trying to interrupt me on the call and then when I asked her 'how the wedding planning was going' she said it's all going to shit and then she hung up\n\nIt seems she had something to say to what you were telling her, but you felt it was an interruption. For this alone it seems you don't really care if you are an AH or not or even if you finally get pregnant or not when the time comes.\n\nAlso, as most people already stated, is not that simple planning a pregnancy. Is like saying that in a year from now you will be for winning the lottery because you are planning on buying a lot of lottery tickets.", "YTA kinda. I agree it is better to be honest about your plans. But I think I'd have left it a bit more open given that you aren't actually pregnant and you don't know for sure how fast it will happen. I don't think potentially having a baby stops you being involved at this point, it's just a warning.\n\nIf it were me I would probably have positioned it as I'd love to be considered a bridesmaid and get involvef in planning and prep but mention that you hope to be pregnant or have a newborn so that may mean you won't be the best choice. You'd be happy to let her know if you do get pregnant or if she'd prefer to not have you as an official bridesmaid you won't be upset and are still happy to be involved.", "Such optimism.", "If you are truly friends there should not be a problem. You have plans, she has plans. It is best for her to have different person in your place as you might be not avaliable. Getting pregnant is very easy when you do not want children and almost impossible when you do. You both should understand that.", "NTA. Yeah, maybe you will be preggers, maybe not, but you have made a plan and it is acceptable to say no to other people if you think you will be otherwise occupied. \n\nWe are not obligated to bend to others' plans. OP did not say she wouldn't go to the wedding, just that they wouldn't stand in the wedding.", "NTA but neither is your friend. I think in general you don't have to say yes to being anyone's bridesmaid without having much of an excuse, but she asked you before and you said yes, and now you're saying no - with a somewhat reasonable excuse. However, your friend sounds like she needs a friend and it should be you to reach out to her as you have dumped her for a reason that might not even occur as getting pregnant regardless of being v. fertile or not is a miracle and as much as you want to plan the timeline, it doesn't always work that way. What happens if her wedding comes and you're not pregnant... At the end of the day, it's your life and you don't have to put your life/family on hold for anyone but you can't blame your friend for being a little upset as weddings are stressful as well.... Meet up with your friend and offer the help you can, that's what I'd do. I do think you're lacking a tiny bit of empathy so maybe a really soft AH.... \n\nGirl idk but talk to your friend, not Reddit.... But update if you do\ud83d\udc40", "NTA- You don\u2019t want to get out at to get last minute and You it don\u2019t want to plan your entire life around your friend\u2019s wedding. There is nothing wrong with that.", "NTA. You were upfront, you gave her plenty of notice. She may be afraid your baby will pull focus from her. You may find you don't receive an invitation at all. But you did everything right. Good luck with the baby!", "NAH\n\nYou thought you were being honest but I think you were underestimating how important this was to her and the fact that you KNEW right away and hurried to tell her prob made her feel like you didn't really consider it to begin with. \n\nAnd mainly - as others have pointed out - pregnancy very often takes longer than expected. Sometimes it doesn't but - your optimism prob made her feel like your best case scenario doesn't really give AF about her. \n\nYour intentions were to not let her proceed with a wrong assumption but I think you also needed to think more about how she would feel about it. \n\nI would def tell her you would love to help in some ways (your own wedding isn't really a reason to not spend a little time on her IMO) and that you realize life doesn't go as planned and it's up to her how involved she would like you to be, knowing you MAY end up pregnant and unable to travel.", "I don't understand all the y t a. You aren't obligated to be a bridesmaid simply because you are asked. You are free to say no for any reason at all including you simply just don't want to. You are, however, setting yourself up for disappointment if you think you are going to get pregnant on your timeline. It dosent work that way and if you get stressed and overthink it if you don't get pregnant, it will be even harder still to get pregnant. Try to ease up on your expectations there. NTA.", "NTA. You called right away so she'd have plenty of time to figure things out for her wedding. Better to do that than back out at the last minute. If this upset her enough not to speak to you for 2 months I'd say you really did the right thing to avoid all the drama.", "NTA at all! You have a very good reason to not commit to such an intensive position in her wedding, and told her as soon as you could. Honestly, that's the ideal way to do it. I hope she realises this and apologises for her poor behaviour, but it is telling of what kind of person she is, unfortunately.", "NTA\n\nYour reasons for declining are perfectly reasonable.", "NAH\n\nYou have reasons for saying no.  She's ok to be upset by them.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nI think you should write her a lovely letter explaining all this and how you realise how difficult everything must be for her. Letters are very underrated and much nicer than an email. Do a draft letter first until you know it's just right.", "NTA. Being a bridesmaid is a biggggg job, it takes time, money and commitment. And if you don\u2019t want to, you don\u2019t have to do it!", "NTA When I was getting married and asked my friend she said yes, but said that she and her husband planned to start trying by a certain date so in the case she was pregnant she may have to step down( prospective birth date coincided with wedding). I was super excited for them and their plans, said \"sounds great and I totally understand if you have to drop out but am excited to have you be part of the big day if you are able to make it.\" The reality: she made it, they didn't get pregnant until after the wedding and that was it. Only thing I'd say is you could have accepted with that caveat but I think my friend also knew I wouldn't be one of these unhinged brides who told her to move her future birth plans for my wedding so all worked out and it was easy.", "I am going to vote NTA considering that  \"Her wedding location is also about 7 hours away in another country so would require some serious travel.\" If she were local it would not be a big deal as long as the bride didn't object to a large bellied bridesmaid. \n\nWhile many Redditers say that you can not time pregnancies, there are many women like myself who only have to have their husband get that gleam in their eye and they are done for.  If OP is actively trying for a baby, it is most likely that she will be pregnant within the year (average is 6 to 12 months). I had 3 pregnancies in the first month of trying.\n\n Has she said somewhere when the friend's wedding will be?\n\nBeing a bridesmaid is expensive and comes with a lot of responsibility. I think that if OP wants to say no, she is well within her rights. \n\nI would also like to add that recent global events have taught us that crossing borders is not always easy or even possible. The situation can literally change overnight. If flights are involved, things can be even more problematic.", "INFO: So sounds like you are getting married yourself in the next couple of months. Is she your bridesmaid?\n\nAlso YTA for how you handled this. You could have said you would love to be her bridesmaid but wanted to make her aware you and your fiance are planning to start trying for a baby straight after your own wedding, so you may have to pull out down the track. Then ask her which she would prefer.", "Soft YTA for me. Bitter experience has taught me that you can't decline plans because you might be pregnant or have a baby. I planned to get pregnant a few months after getting married. I had 4 miscarriages and my son wasn't born until 2019 - I got married in 2016. I truly, sincerely hope this isn't your experience, but don't put off special events and important moments with people you love because of 'might'.", "She\u2019s got wedding planning madness syndrome, she can\u2019t see straight at the moment because the stress has turned her into a cyborg. She will forgive you eventually I think? Your reasoning is legit and you have to put your soon to be born child first - it\u2019s unfortunate. Congratulations on the baby! \n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t read that you\u2019re not actually pregnant.  Soft YTA in that case, but if you are pregnant and expecting you wouldn\u2019t be an AH for declining to fly to another country to perform duties for your friend.", "YTA\n\nI mean that in the kindest way and don\u2019t want to use it as my judgement but you are.  You didn\u2019t have to accept being a bridesmaid because nobody has to accept the invitation BUTTTT you made the entire thing about your own happiness, your own wedding planning that\u2019s going well, your future planning that\u2019s going well in your mind because you didn\u2019t forsee real life hiccups.  Next time ask the person how they are, what\u2019s going on with them, give them a chance to feel seen, heard and also acknowledge that another hiccup came to them while everybody else is getting what they want", "YTA.\n\nI know how you think because I have been there. We spend our teens and early adult years focusing on the birth control. Never let it fail etc bc absolutely don't want to get pregnant. \n\nAfter spending all those years very very very careful not to get pregnant, it can seriously be surprising to NOT get pregnant as soon as you stop the birth control. \n\nI KNEW in theory that it can take time. I was very silly, I know. But idk... something about the focusing on not getting pregnant made me feel like the \"risk\" was imminent every single unprotected sex. And then... nothing. Month after month, year after year. \n\nI did get pregnant eventually, but it took several years and doctor's appointments. \n\nYou need to call your friend and apologize. Tell her you want to be a bridesmaid, but you want her to know you will be trying for a baby. \n\nI wish you luck with the baby and that you indeed will be very pregnant at the time of your friend's wedding.", "YTA. I get you're hoping to be pregnant around that time but in reality you have no idea if you will conceive that fast. I'd be hurt too if my friend backed out of being in my wedding cause they might be pregnant. It's okay to give a heads up and say you might have to back out if you are x months along, or if the baby is already there, but to straight up say no makes it sound like you had no interest in being a part of her wedding at all. Which is valid but I think using the maybe baby as an excuse is a dick move.", "YTA You don\u2019t know if you are actually even going to be pregnant!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sorry, OP, but it is so unreasonable to plan your life around something that didn't happen yet, specially something you have no control over like a pregnancy, it is not because you have a timeline for it that it is going to happen when you want to. It can be immediately, it can take months, it can take more than a year. \n\nSo I get your friend being upset. It sounds so insane that someone would say something like that to reject a braidmaids proposal that honestly, sound like you just made a lame excuse to say no because you wanted to say no.

We\u2019d pretty much resigned ourselves to being the fun aunt and uncle and then all of the sudden.", "Thanks, yeah I understand that I did underestimate how important this was to her. If one of my bridesmaids knew that they couldn't commit I would just want to know straight away. I didn't take into account that she may not think the same way. She's already bought 3 bride dresses and bridesmaid dresses even though she is getting married in about 18 months time, so given that she plans so far ahead I wouldv'e thought that she would want to have her bridesmaid numbers confirmed ASAP. Clearly, I was wrong. \n\nI do understand that I may not be pregnant at the time, however most medical  journals/ medical websites state between 75-90 percent of women conceive within a year of trying. This time next year I'll have been trying for about a year. Although I would like to stress that I do understand that it can take longer to conceive or I may require IVF.

Whether or not you conceive is outside of your control. All you can do it try. If you build your life around something as unpredictable as pregnancy, you\u2019ll be setting yourself up for disappointment down the line.

Do people need a refresher on consent?  It doesn't only apply to sex. A respectful relationship requires the ability for you to say no.  \nSecondly, her response to you declining tells you that no, you should not be her bridesmaid anyway!

But honestly it sounds to me that your plans were probably combined with other factors like what you know of her and your interest in being her bridesmaid and so I still think you did the right thing.  Are people saying you could have kept your plans hidden and pulled out if you do indeed fall pregnant? Hmm, I disagree. I mean that would be well within your rights but it seems like unnecessary hassle and leaves you with the burden of knowing you are hoping to be unavailable for a commitment you made.

You can decline being a bridesmaid for any reason.  It isn't a summons.  And your intentions were good - you don't want to mess up her plans.

You guys are so entitled.", "NTA you were honest as for the reasons and you got back to her ASAP. my guess is she's having a lot of grief over the wedding and unfairly, is targeting you for the agita.", "NAH \n\nWarning her that you wouldn\u2019t be able to commit because you anticipate being pregnant makes sense to me. I\u2019m currently almost 10 weeks pregnant and it\u2019s been HARD. I couldn\u2019t imagine travel to that extent even in this early stage - morning sickness is real and can happen all day. Traveling out of the country when you\u2019re far along isn\u2019t a good idea - doctors even warn against it. \n\nBut, you may take more time to get pregnant that you realize. You could have told her the plan and asked if she would rather you back out if things follow that plan or just opt out from the beginning. \n\nI\u2019m going NAH because she\u2019s handling this really poorly. So, even if you had communicated better, it seems like she has a hard time not getting her way.", "If you are for sure pregnant, then you're NTA, but if this baby hasn't even been conceived yet..... \ud83e\udee0 Yikes.", "Soft YTA. \n\nOh to be that naive version of myself again when I just knew I\u2019d be pregnant as soon as we started trying. That was years ago - still not pregnant. But I hope that\u2019s not the case for you. I hope you do get pregnant right away if that\u2019s what you want, but even still, you should NOT be making decisions based on \u201cmaybe\u2019s.\u201d It can take a while even for healthy people, and you don\u2019t want to miss out on life because you could be pregnant.", "YTA", "YTA , you could have accepted her offer and gave her a heads up that you will be trying to get pregnant but obviously you can\u2019t predict if it ll happen or not. Instead you straight up rejected her for no reason \u2026", "I suppose she could have explained to friend why she didn\u2019t think she should be a bridesmaid and given the option. But while it\u2019s nice to be asked it\u2019s not compulsory to say yes", "NTA weddings are a ton of work even if you play a small part.", "TL;DR \nJust going off the title nah I don\u2019t think so. One of my best friends got married to a girl that had cheated on him and i refused to be his best man because i knew it was a mistake. Their divorced now", "You aren\u2019t even pregnant yet? No dude YTA.", "NTA. Regardless of your reason for not wanting to participate, you did the right thing letting her know ASAP, giving her the option to find someone else to fill the role.

It's not always one and done. Don't miss out on life experiences for something that is very difficult to plan for.\n\nHowever you could have mentioned that was your intention, that in that case you'd back out, and ask if she still wanted you as part of the party. \n\nEither way, sounds like you dodged a big headache given her reaction.", "NAH\n\nMy dear OP, it just took me 8 months to get pregnant.

What a strange thing for you to do.", "NTA", "Your planning of a wedding that hasn\u2019t even been announced yet trumped her wedding that has been announced.

You seem jealous of her wedding needing to make it about your wedding planning and your baby. Instead of being happy for her in her moment you are making it about you.", "INFO: it\u2019s not clear. Are you currently pregnant or just assuming you will be at that time?", "You did the right thing.  You realized that with your plan of having a new baby or being very pregnant at the time of the wedding held 7 hours away, you won't be able to perform all the tasks expected of a bridesmaid, and you told the bride.  You told her early enough in the process that she could tap someone else.\n\nThe bride's reaction is hostile and seems to lack an awareness that while she's important to you, getting married and having your baby when planned is more important than serving in her wedding party.\n\nNTA", "You\u2019re not even pregnant or trying yet get a grip on reality. YTA", "Honestly this post is so much better than a post about having to pull out of your friend\u2019s wedding because you\u2019re pregnant after knowing you were planning on trying. I understand why she\u2019s upset as it\u2019s probably a shock to her, but I think you did the right thing. NTA", "Also everyone saying that she probably won\u2019t conceive straight away is a bit fucked up. You don\u2019t know her situation. She could have fertility issues and already be making arrangements and strangers have the nerve to say this shit? Absolutely not", "Everything about this is Eshh. You previously gave her your word so she has every right to be upset as she obviously valued your relationship enough to even extend the offer. Simply going back on your word for a reason that doesn\u2019t exist yet makes it look like you don\u2019t care about her. You easily could\u2019ve explained your problem with the dates and agreed to accept a very limited role as a bridesmaid. At the end of the day it\u2019s your life so you have every right to plan ahead according to the future you want. Her plans shouldn\u2019t dictate yours.\n\nI will say though that every wedding I\u2019ve been too (only 3) has had a pregnant bridesmaid who didn\u2019t do much aside from be there day of and participate in bridesmaids stuff. They obviously were able to find an amicable solution and I\u2019m guessing it was because two way communication which you definitely lacked. Definite Essh", "Both of you are bizarre, I had to re-read the initial post thinking you were ALREADY pregnant. You\u2019re not even pregnant and you\u2019re assuming you will be at that exact moment and your friend can\u2019t understand that you said no.

You can decline he requested for you to be bridesmaid.", "Second this - whenever someone factors in being pregnant to future plans when they\u2019ve only just started trying you know they\u2019re in for an rude awakening. Took me a year and a half to get pregnant and that\u2019s factoring in no age or fertility issues and actively tracking timing.", "I can\u2019t believe the upvotes on this response \n\nYou are being SO SO forward thinking and considerate letting her know and plan NOW as opposed to letting her get fucked and having to replan and rearrange EVERYTHING as it relates to bridesmaid shit within 6-12 months of her wedding\n\nWhat a nightmare this could be for her shuffling events and dresses and finding new bridesmaids to replace you in the wedding party, etc to accommodate your pregnancy, gawd forbid pregnancy complications or whatever else can happen when you are actively trying for or actually pregnant.\n\nYou did the right thing by considering the logistics and potential fallout that would inevitably happen by committing to her once in a lifetime event and then having it upended by your pregnancy around the same time as her wedding.\n\nNTA", "You want OP to delay her pregnancy to be this girl's bridesmaid??  Did I read that right??  I would never do this...for anyone.  Pregnancy is a crap shoot (for most people) so to suggest they use birth control to avoid any obstacles for this wedding is ludicrous.", "But still anyone can say no to being a bridesmaid. Maybe she just doesn\u2019t want to take the extra time and money to be a bridesmaid. It can get expensive with trips and brunches etc.", "If she turns down expecting to be pregnant and isn\u2019t that will be super painful as well.

Giving Friend the opportunity to say 'oh yeah I wouldn't really want to deal with figuring out how to replace you, dang' or 'oh no worries if you have to back out you have to back out,' would have involved her in the decision. But OP framing it sort of saying she's making the decision because she knows Friend isn't very adaptable. \n\nOf course, if friend was thinking any of that she could have used her words. \n\nI'm going ESH. I get what OP was going for it was just so, so awkwardly done. And honestly planning on getting pregnant on a particular schedule seems like tempting fate.", "It's not irrelevant. That was her sole excuse, and it's a ridiculous one. If she just doesn't want to do it or doesn't want to travel or whatever then that's fine.

It's not. You have literally a two day window of fertility every month.  It's depending on several factors: timing, preparation and health, both yours and your partner's. Several external factors can also affect your fertility. Stress might be an issue. The kind of job that you do might be an issue. How well and how many hours you sleep might be an issue. Your current birth control might be an issue.\n\nHow well do you know your cycle? Are you monitoring it? Do you know your fertility window?\n\nI think you definitely need to read more in depth about this and understand everything that fertility entails before planning your life around assumptions or you might be setting yourself up for disappointment later on. Good luck on your fertility journey!", "The easiest solution was to accept but let her know the plan and that it might mean you have to drop out.

She doesn\u2019t sound happy or unhappy for her friend.  Her tone is neutral.  People can absolutely not want to celebrate someone else\u2019s happiness.  It happens all the time.

So I don\u2019t see your point.", "I had a friend get pregnant the night she stopped taking birth control pills. Yeah conception can take years. It can also take 3 minutes and a broken condom.", "This is the right call tbh. If I asked a close friend of 10 years to be a bridesmaid she flatly declined because she could potentially be pregnant I'd be pretty hurt. If she said hey, I love you and would love to be a part of your wedding but heads up we're trying for a baby and there's a chance I may have to drop out, I would totally understand. It's how you deliver the news and what it says about how you value your friendship.

That\u2019s what being a bridesmaid is. OP not pregnant and she has no idea if she will be by time this wedding comes around. That\u2019s what makes her reason non existent. This isn\u2019t some random person in OP\u2019s life. This is her friend of 10 years. In friendships, you do things for each other. If you\u2019re going to refuse a friend\u2019s request to support them by being a bridesmaid, it should be for a valid reason, not an non existent one. Usually friends don\u2019t turn down being in their friend\u2019s weddings unless they\u2019re unable to do it for some reason. OP is able to be in the wedding. She\u2019s just refusing to do it.", "Right - my point was just that if you\u2019ve conveyed to someone in the past that you intend to be their bridesmaid you at least owe them a reason if you change your mind.", "It's 7 hours away in another country. That alone is a valid reason. \"It's just not my thing\" is another valid reason too. Who are these bridezillas who think they can monopolize someone's life for the sake of their own wedding day? The fucking gall... You know, most people would be overjoyed if a friend simply showed up. The silent treatment is a huge red flag on the bride. Jesus, bride needs to calm the fuck down.", "People change and so do their priorities. If you cant accept that then you never were their friend in the first place.", "OP is doing family planning"]}
