You provided the money for your 12 year old child to get an appropriate gift for her mother, at your daughter's request.  Your 12 year old doesn't have a source of disposable income from her career as a middle school student.\n\nYour daughter wanting to get her mother something for valentine's day, and being comfortable enough to ask for your help tells me that your daughter is kind and loving.

How did ex expect a 12 year old to pay for it? NTA", "NTA\n\nIt is fantastic that your daughter asked you to be able to assist with getting her mom something for Valentine\u2019s Day. Your ex is an AH for not seeing that and appreciating it.", "NTA, and I think it's nice that you want to foster a giving attitude in your daughter. Unfortunately Ex took it poorly, so maybe ask her how she would like you to proceed next time. Maybe you can give daughter a prepaid visa to do her gift giving, to distance yourself from the actual purchase of the gift.", "Nta you did something really nice and did not deserve that.", "NTA your ex is being deliberately obtuse here. You did a very kind thing.", "NTA I see why her prefix is EX.", "NTA\n\nI think we see a clue as to why you're divorced.", "NTA what the what is this? We have always gotten our son's mom a gift from him for major holidays and her birthday. Your ex is ridiculous. Not your fault they're so insecure.", "NTA.\n\nBut I can see how having something mailed to the house from you (yes it\u2019s \u201cfrom\u201d your daughter but packing info etc is from you) is a bit odd.  When helping your daughter get gifts in the future (assuming you still want to) I\u2019d stick with physical things that daughter can personally hand to her mom.  That just keeps it clear that it\u2019s from daughter, you\u2019re not attached to it at all.", "NTa, your ex however is if she can't understand that it was her daughter's idea and you just paid for it. How sad is that really? She's 12 so not like she's making money yet.", "Nta \nI wonder if she will fill the same way about non romantic days like Christmas/Hanukkah, Mother\u2019s Day, her birthday??? Your ex sounds petty and also make sure it is actually her you texted and not the new guy pretending to be her.", "My parents were divorced and I used to ask if they could help me get other parent something for Christmas or birthday etc. I don't think it is weird at all. Maybe if you all haven't been separated for that long I could see it being a bit tougher. I think when people split up they sometimes forget its only about the kids now and nothing else. The past should stay there. NTA.", "NTA-My parents divorced when I was in first grade. My dad funded all the gifts I would give to my mom and vise versa. Even when I was older and had learned to save my own money,  my dad would still pay for my gifts that I would give to my mom. Your ex just needs to get over it", "NTA. But your Ex is. She should just say thank you for doing that for your daughter!!", "NTA, what you did was showing your daughter how a real man is suppose to treat the mother of their child, and the fact that it was an actual gift from your daughter not you should have been thanks enough. When my kids were younger I would take my kids shopping to get their dad (my ex-husband) a gift from them and he would do the same thing, for Christmas, birthday, mother/fathers day, we would even buy the stepparents something too. It showed the kids that even though mommy and daddy didn\u2019t work out that we were still a family and that we would always be together, the stepparents loved because they didn\u2019t feel excluded in fact my ex-husbands wife still buys me gifts and I do for her to even though they are grown adults.", "It definitely came from exs current bf. He made her say that to prove something.  Sad. Def  NTA", "NTA..\n\nShe\u2019s making it into something that it\u2019s not. Will she have the same energy on Mother\u2019s Day? Or will she be expect something all of sudden.", "NTA. I can understand an ex being uncomfortable in a situation like that (for example, the other person may use the fact they paid for the gift against them) but in this case it was clearly you just helping your daughter out but your ex self-centeredly made it about her. The fact that she either can\u2019t see past her animosity towards you or her ego (or both) to see it was just a gift from her kid is insane\ud83d\udc80. I hope she pulls her head out of her ass and sees her daughter as more than a human chess piece.", "No, you are not. It was generous of you to pay for a gift your daughter could give her mother. It was a sweet gesture on your part. It's a special bond between you and your daughter. You are providing a wonderful example of how divorced parents can be kind to each other.", "NTA. 12 year olds don\u2019t have steady income. Where was she gonna get the money from? My ex did the same thing as you, the kids wanted to get me v-day gifts so he paid. They\u2019re not from him they\u2019re from my kids. Conversely I buy the gifts for him for stuff like Father\u2019s Day and birthdays. Your ex is super insecure.", "NTA but your ex and \u201cher man\u201d sure are.", "NAH", "NTA. Tell her that the next time your daughter wants to get her a gift that you'll tell her no. You can't buy mommy a present because she has an insecure boyfriend whose feelings are more important that yours. See if that fixes the problem.", "lol, I was already planning on opening a checking account for her on her next birthday because I have USAA and getting her in with them would help with a lot of things in the future and help teach her how to be responsible with money before having to learn the hard way.", "I cannot see opening a checking account in the daughter's name. I think the wife should not get \"store bought gifts\". I would explain to the daughter that her mom sees purchased gifts as exclusively to come from her spouse. Perhaps the daughter would like to hand make something for her mom. I wonder if dad would be allowed to buy his daughter art supplies to use! IMO, dad did the right thing.

Home made cards from her from now on.", "More likely the daughter showed him up and is pissed because OP paid for it.", "Him calling himself daddy in a text to the ex wife is also odd AF.  I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the AH but that\u2019s just all kinds of odd.", "She always gets her mom something, but this was the first time my daughter asked me to help with it.", "I don't talk to my ex at all, unless it has something to do with our daughter.", "Thankfully our daughter was at school when she got the strawberries.  I've since talked to my daughter as my daughter was eating one of them lol.  Apparently her mom told her they were going to be to her (our daughter) from me.", "That was my immediate thought lol the daughter showed him up and because OP paid for it and that's what this is all about.", "Unfortunately we live in different states, but the only thing that had my address was the billing everything else was in my daughter name.", "Worse advice ever! Obviously you don\u2019t have children of your own \ud83d\ude44", "My dad made an account for me at his CU when I was 14, and I'm so glad he did! Never have had to deal with any big bank in the US.", "and thats why she is the ex!  some people just like to be difficult.

Plenty of moms do the exact same thing and no one bats an eye.", "Just tell you ex: \u201cLook, our daughter is 12 and sometimes wants to buy things, and if what she asks for isn\u2019t an unreasonable expense, I\u2019ll give her the money.
