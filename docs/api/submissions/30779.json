Im the oldest boy and 2nd oldest in total. I have always had a lot of responsibilities thrown on me especially with the kids, doing dishes for 7 people, watching the kids constantly for my parents, doing there laundry because most of them were young asf. Then, out of fucking no where when I was around 12-13 my aunt came over and she had a guy with her and I obviously knew she was on something at the time. She brought her 2 kids and she was genuinely abusive, she called her kids devil children and she would scream at them pretty fucking bad but that was kinda how my dad was too. Anywho, a month or so later my dad went n picked them up bc apparently my aunt stated \u201cIm going to sell the kids to the cartel if you dont come take them. Im not giving them to DHS\u201d like what the absolute fuck. Im pretty sure she mightve been high on drugs and just making up some shit but that mightve been real honestly im not sure.. \n\nAt the time they were I think 6 and 4? and they had obvious issues the 4 year old had the mind of around a 2 year old and they were constantly screaming. And thry were going through meth withdrawl aswell. Weve had them for 3 years now and they have heavily impacted our lives. It went from 5 kids I had to take care of to 5 kids and 2 kids with severe ptsd, lying issues, manipulation issues (6 year old), and the 4 year old has short term memory loss im pretty sure and whenever she does something wrong or she thinks she does something wrong she freaks out and its like one time I was watching them and I came around the corner and she was eating a marker and I asked her if she was eating a marker and she said \u201cno\u201d and started balling and im like this little mf. \n\nIt has been so hard trying to take care of these 2 kids and surprisingly its easier to take care of the other 5.\n\nAll I can say is I understand and you are NTA", "Nta.\n\n What would have been better to say is that you wish your parents would act as proper parents caring for you too and recognizing your sister is not your responsibility.

I have a special hatred for parents who make elder siblings parents in their absence. \n\nI second upthread speaking to someone. Is there someone at your school you can speak to? Over here they have support for children who are carers. But that tends to be because they\u2019re looking after a sick parent. Not because they have two able parents who can\u2019t be bothered. \n\nAlso I\u2019m sort of wondering how much parenting you actually get? They can\u2019t even provide for your sister (and I\u2019m assuming she takes the majority of their time) what about you? \n\nDo you have any other family members nearby?

My ASD son waits in the car with me when my NT son has his activities, and my NT son stays with me in the car when my ASD son has his activities/therapies.

It may help you vent about your anger (which is valid!!) and alleviate some of it.

Honestly, watching someone at 14 years old really isn't that safe, especially when the child has a disability.  They should hire a babysitter who is able to properly care for children with special needs.  They should make accommodations so that you have more cake if you want it.  They should make sure that you do not become your sister's caretaker.  That is their job.  They're not handling things correctly. \n\nI'm not going to label you as an AH for saying the wrong thing.

But it\u2019s different because your sister has ASD. This means when you\u2019re responsible for her, it isn\u2019t in a regular sibling way. You\u2019re being forced to act as her caregiver, which of course will build animosity. It honestly sounds like your parents can\u2019t handle it all the time so they\u2019re relying on you, which will predictably cause you to have animosity toward your sister.

The parents have to allocate monies for her care in a facility and then when that is gone the state is responsible for her care. When op is 18 she can walk away from that sh*t fest. She is not obligated to care for her sister now. Her parent are *ssholes", "I don't agree that the parents are mentally unwell  I think they are incredibly selfish.", "You think they'll care? Lol", "You made it real clear you didn\u2019t properly read the post", "You\u2019re being cruel to a child. Stop.", "OP is NTA, but after reading all your comments you are a gaping one. Bloody hell, have some compassion for a child that is being made to act like an adult. \n\nYou are questioning others ability to read, but you are missing the very clear issues in OP\u2019s post. \n\nJust because your own mother treated you like dirt, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay for others to do that to them. It\u2019s not character building, it\u2019s just plain wrong. A child should not need to grow stronger to face their parents, parents should be a safe harbour in a stressful world.", "You seem to be expecting the op to have emotional control beyond what is developmentally appropriate for his age. That is ridiculous. \n\nHe\u2019s a kid himself and his parents are treating him abusively. We all know he\u2019s not really upset with his sister or her existence, but because he is *14 years old* we are taking development into account here. He even knows to a degree that his issue is actually with his parents, not the sister. \n\nYour claim that he simply needs to \u201cvalue himself\u201d is equally absurd. It doesn\u2019t matter that you overcame abuse (but did you though? You seem pretty quick to blame the victim, sounds like you have a lot more work to do) op is not you, not in your situation, and has different issues to move past. \n\nYour comments all indicate that you didn\u2019t properly read or comprehend the post at all, and if I seem hostile it might be because you\u2019re being an ass to an *abused child*", "Look, what\u2019s being done to OP is extremely shitty. But no social service agency is going to take it seriously if a mandated reporter calls up and says that a student has to babysit too much. Note: I am not saying that what is going on with OP is OK! I\u2019m saying that if social services gives two shits that they have to watch their sibling, as long as they are allowed to go to school and can get a decent night of sleep and are fed and clothed, and not beaten or sexually abused? I will eat my iPhone. Social services is not going to give half of a shit.", "Op and their sibling have food, shelter, clothes, goes to school\u2026 their home has working utilities\u2026 legally the parents are doing everything they must. There\u2019s nothing here to report. If parentification was legally considered abuse a whole lot of poor children would be removed from their households just because they are too poor to pay for daycare. \n\nIt sucks for OP, don\u2019t get me wrong. But the parents aren\u2019t legally doing anything wrong here. All OP can do is wait to turn 18 and move out immediately.", "And not going to be the long term plan for their sibling's care either, because that's definitely what they are going to try to do.", "OP is male.", "[deleted]", "I never said that they would. I simply commented on what a mandated reporter was.", "Multiple teachers in this thread are saying otherwise.", "Leaving a high needs child with another child who (going from context) has been watching them for years is neglect. \n\nNeglect is not simply no food, no shelter. It's also about supervision. I couldn't just leave a 5 year old home alone and I certainly couldn't leave a 7 year old home to 'look after' that 5 year old. Op NOW is a reasonable age but I doubt he was when this started.", "Parentification is abuse. How\u2019s that for simple?", "And they\u2019re either full of it or not teachers lol", "[deleted]", "I love how the default reddit response to evidence that disagrees with you is to just. Call everyone but you a liar and say it isn't real. Really facilitates an air of discussion, doesn't it?"]}
