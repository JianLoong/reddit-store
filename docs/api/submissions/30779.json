Find reasons to stay after school to study in the library on a group project.  Great grades will allow you to apply for multiple smaller scholarships, which can really add up.

Im the oldest boy and 2nd oldest in total. I have always had a lot of responsibilities thrown on me especially with the kids, doing dishes for 7 people, watching the kids constantly for my parents, doing there laundry because most of them were young asf. Then, out of fucking no where when I was around 12-13 my aunt came over and she had a guy with her and I obviously knew she was on something at the time. She brought her 2 kids and she was genuinely abusive, she called her kids devil children and she would scream at them pretty fucking bad but that was kinda how my dad was too. Anywho, a month or so later my dad went n picked them up bc apparently my aunt stated \u201cIm going to sell the kids to the cartel if you dont come take them. Im not giving them to DHS\u201d like what the absolute fuck. Im pretty sure she mightve been high on drugs and just making up some shit but that mightve been real honestly im not sure.. \n\nAt the time they were I think 6 and 4? and they had obvious issues the 4 year old had the mind of around a 2 year old and they were constantly screaming. And thry were going through meth withdrawl aswell. Weve had them for 3 years now and they have heavily impacted our lives. It went from 5 kids I had to take care of to 5 kids and 2 kids with severe ptsd, lying issues, manipulation issues (6 year old), and the 4 year old has short term memory loss im pretty sure and whenever she does something wrong or she thinks she does something wrong she freaks out and its like one time I was watching them and I came around the corner and she was eating a marker and I asked her if she was eating a marker and she said \u201cno\u201d and started balling and im like this little mf. \n\nIt has been so hard trying to take care of these 2 kids and surprisingly its easier to take care of the other 5.\n\nAll I can say is I understand and you are NTA", "Nta.\n\n What would have been better to say is that you wish your parents would act as proper parents caring for you too and recognizing your sister is not your responsibility.

I have a special hatred for parents who make elder siblings parents in their absence. \n\nI second upthread speaking to someone. Is there someone at your school you can speak to? Over here they have support for children who are carers. But that tends to be because they\u2019re looking after a sick parent. Not because they have two able parents who can\u2019t be bothered. \n\nAlso I\u2019m sort of wondering how much parenting you actually get? They can\u2019t even provide for your sister (and I\u2019m assuming she takes the majority of their time) what about you? \n\nDo you have any other family members nearby?

My ASD son waits in the car with me when my NT son has his activities, and my NT son stays with me in the car when my ASD son has his activities/therapies. Yes, I may ask my NT son to make sure his brother is drying his hair while I put away their clothes after swimming, or I may ask him to give his hand to his brother when they're crossing the road, but I would never, ever, expect him to babysit his brother so my husband and I can go out.

Maybe talking to them and explaining your feelings could help, but in my experience parents won't always listen to their kids. I suggest asking for a therapist, if your parents can afford this.

It may help you vent about your anger (which is valid!!) and alleviate some of it.

Honestly, watching someone at 14 years old really isn't that safe, especially when the child has a disability.  They should hire a babysitter who is able to properly care for children with special needs.  They should make accommodations so that you have more cake if you want it.  They should make sure that you do not become your sister's caretaker.  That is their job.  They're not handling things correctly. \n\nI'm not going to label you as an AH for saying the wrong thing.

Doing so would be accepting that their daughter\u2019s future will never play out the way they planned and/or expected it to; this is so incredibly difficult to digest and processing it took me years (especially since I\u2019m a single parent). It involves processing that not only will their child\u2019s future look different but so will theirs.

The resentment is like an acid that erodes relationships. Hopefully this serves as a wakeup call. \n\nNote: as their son please remember sometimes parents need a bit of grace too.

Hopefully there is a way you can work together to all benefit. A family calander in a central location sounds like the best bet. Maybe it starts off with so many hours a week or per day you can do your thing. Also realizing sometimes a family has to give and take.

That's just an example.) \n\n** As a person you can't change others.you can point out issues and faults and hope for the best. You can't change others.  You CAN improve to be your best self though.

Ask them to make their expectations clear, and you make yours clear, and for everyone to be on the same page.

It's not that your sister's autism makes you watch her or give her most of your birthday cake; it's your parents who choose to make you watch your sister and give her most of your birthday cake, etc., just as your parents choose not to bother teaching her that she can't always get everything she wants. So while I understand that you're a kid and you're (justifiably) angry, it's neither appropriate nor helpful for you to direct your anger at your sister, and saying things like you did unfortunately make it easy for your parents to dismiss it because it makes you sound hateful and mean and cruel to a young, developmentally disabled child who didn't choose to be born (or to be austisic). So I feel like I have to say a gentle YTA, because your little sister really didn't deserve to be attacked like that. You might try talking to your parents again later, when everyone is calm, and telling them that you're sorry for what you said about, and misdirecting your anger at, your sister, but you have legitimate reasons to be angry with them.
