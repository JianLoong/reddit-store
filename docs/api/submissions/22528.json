Why was he mad at you for pointing that out?\n\nI mean, it seems like you were AT the doctor's clinic, but you were wearing headphones, talking to a \"trainee with a client\" therefore giving your actual attention to two folks far, far away. Not to your child, the doctor OR your hubby. Like, do you even remember everything the doctor said?\n\nYou may have rode along OP, but you were not \"PRESENT\". **And that's okay,** because there's a whole nother parent who was, theoretically, present and parenting...but he's resentful and mad at you because your daughter acted up? Do I have this right?\n\nIf so, please stop multi-task parenting, OP. If all it takes is your presence in the room to magically transform 2F from \"behaving well\" to \"a challenge\", then *she needs to spend more time being parented by her father*, right? Let him do that, stay out of the room, do your own shift.\n\nSo dad needs to spend more time being a dad. And you need get a driver's license. And nobody should be giving anyone else the silent treatment.", "NTA.  It's really easy for this gendered division of labor to pop up in parenting and household duties, and you're not wrong to bring it up.\n\n(That said, it's true that everyone is stressed out when the baby is sick, so you're probably going to get more mileage by bringing this topic up again when everyone isn't stressed out.)", "NTA Why does he think he\u2019s incapable?", "I assume she goes to daycare five days a week. Which means he picks her up and drops her off, so ten events a week. How often does she go to the doctor? Let's say it's once a month. See what I am saying.", "ESH. Your husband is already performing most of the transportation duties and you basically working during the doctor's appointment doesn't help anyone. That said, your husband should've been able to handle this appointment on his own and not made a fuss.", "NTA. Obviously it doesn\u2019t need both parents to take a child to the doctors.", "NTA. My father took me to the dr all the time when mother couldn\u2019t go. Your husband needs to learn that there are more fathers in the world who do this and don\u2019t complain because its THEIR kid too.", "Father of two, now teenagers. My wife and I have completely shared responsibilities taking care of the kids. I have always loved being independent with them, unlike so many other guys. Some of the most fun I've had with them throughout the years was when my wife would do a girl's trip for a few days. I was perfectly capable of taking care of them completely. And yes, I've taken them to many doctors appointments all by myself. \n\nNTA While parenting is best if things are kept \"even\" to prevent burnout or hurt feelings, sometimes circumstances don't allow for that, so we adjust. You need to have a good talk where both of you air your feelings and concerns while having an open mind.", "When our two kids were small, my husband and I took turns leaving work and bringing the kids to the doctor.  We would both go sometimes, particularly the first few doc appointments when baby was little, but generally we negotiated who would take the sick baby to the doc.  It wasn't always me or always him.  It seems silly for both of you to go if you're both taking time off work (in my opinion).  Definitely make getting your license a priority and start taking turns!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That being said, it was me that checked her in, explained her symptoms, and I was fully aware of the treatment they were giving and advise given. But to your point, this was more accidental or luck because I could have easily been out of the room and unable to do that if the timing went another way.  \n\nI just expected that as he knew all of her symptoms etc that he would be able and confident enough to do it rather than have me hold his hand- we\u2019ve been there often enough where he has seen what goes on! \n\nMaybe I should have stayed at home but if I said I was unable to go I have the strong suspicion he just wouldn\u2019t have taken her", "Honestly I have no idea, he is totally capable and that\u2019s the frustrating part. I know he can, I know he knows he can, but I think ultimately he doesn\u2019t see it as his \u201crole\u201d. He has, on more than one occasion, told me how lucky I am that he has ever changed a diaper and that many of his friends and colleagues haven\u2019t changed a single one. Weirdest flex I have heard of but that might put him into perspective", "You are correct about the driving, I need to get this rectified ASAP. \n\nI do want to point out that at home I do the primary care. He can\u2019t even tell you where to find her socks, get her ready for the day at daycare, or even when she\u2019s supposed to be fed. So while I understand the comments about him doing more than the fair share of driving, don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t put in effort with my daughter or that I don\u2019t do more than my fair share in other areas.\n\nI care very much for her and will exhaust myself for her. \n\nIf I get my driver\u2019s license then problems like this won\u2019t arise\u2026 but it will become a task that will be solely my responsibility. Again, I don\u2019t actually care if I\u2019m always taking her and doing it solo, I\u2019m fact I\u2019d expect to do it solo. That task doesn\u2019t need two people. But I WOULD expect understanding if once in a blue moon I need it to be him taking her and I need him to be capable of doing it on his own", "Indeed, it definitely sounds like he's putting in more than his fair share with OP incapable of driving.", "I\u2019d agree, if this wasn\u2019t a one time occurrence with forewarning. I\u2019m only 3 weeks away from giving birth, and when I go off I get zero pay for the time I\u2019ll be off with the newborn. I NEED to attend these meetings at work right because it impacts whether or not I get bonus during mat leave to keep us afloat. \n\nI don\u2019t gripe needing to call it off and have us both attend- quite the opposite I want to be there because I know it can be stressful. \n\nBut just on this occasion, given it has been the ONLY TIME, I thought there would be understanding. He KNOWS we need all the money I can take in bonuses for my maternity leave. \n\nIf it was a habit I would agree with you more, but I don\u2019t think needing to do this once, and for a good reason not just the standard \u201cmy work is important so I refuse to rebook\u201d makes me the asshole.\n\nBut, I know I\u2019m still a bit stressed over it so I will think on your words and ask him for his perspective ow that we\u2019re feeling calmer. It\u2019s still a relevant point, and perhaps I didn\u2019t explain why I was doing what I was doing well enough to get the understanding I expected. \n\nOr, maybe I\u2019m totally being irrational and I shouldn\u2019t have attended the work call at all. My gut tells me that wouldn\u2019t have been responsible though", "This \ud83d\udcaf. After reading some comments I actually asked if he got upset because I was on a work call and he felt overwhelmed and unable to to the appointment himself, or if he was just overwhelmed in general at seeing her so poorly and got stressed when she was getting upset while we (sometimes he alone) waited to be seen. \n\nSo thankfully it\u2019s sorted, I understand where the outburst came from and it wasn\u2019t really at me. And I talked about and asked if he felt i was expecting too much of him for transport duties and he said I was not. So it worked out thankfully. \n\nAnd that\u2019s awesome, it\u2019s really what I would love to see him doing too because my dad and I were so close and did lots together just me and my sisters. It was so special getting that time together. He is slowly adjusting (he\u2019s definitely from a more traditional background of men have x role and women have y) but he\u2019s developing so much and I\u2019m seeing some of this between the two of them. So heart warming to see daughter/ daddy bonding like that. And honestly, unless it\u2019s cleaning or cooking or whatever \ud83d\ude02I can see he absolutely enjoys their time together too!", "I\u2019m 99% sure that once I have a license it\u2019s unlikely he will ever take a turn, as he is pretty against ever going his own. But that\u2019s okay, i don\u2019t really mind this responsibility- I just need to know he CAN do it solo for those instances where I need to to be him", "> Both had half attention.\n\nThis means both had zero attention.", "It sounds like you need to take a weekend away and let him spend the entire time being a full-time caregiver. He needs to get straight, real damn quick, that he is a parent, not a drive by visitor in his child's life. That whole gender-based Ward Cleaver thing he's got going on is not going to age well. That he thinks you could should consider yourself lucky he ever changed a diaper is contemptible and disgusting.", "You two need to renegotiate tasks. The task of getting her ready for daycare, I might give a pass on atm, since he takes her. But he should know her feeding schedule and feed her too. If something happens, he should know how to cover these things. Good luck.", "I\u2019m sorry you ALSO are 8 months pregnant?! Does this guy understand that he will be responsible for one and/or both of these children at some point in the next 18 years?\nYou are NTA. Next time tell him that you don\u2019t want your work to distract from the Dr appt and he can bring the kid to the appt alone.", "So soon you'll have *two* kids, a mediocre partner, no income, and no transportation.  What a mess this baby is being born into.\n\nESH, for both the doctor's appointment *and* the overall situation.", "Not zero if I was able to give the symptoms and digest the information on both ends, but yes I get your point. When I was focused on answering work, they got zero. \n\n\ud83d\udcaf on the driver\u2019s license, and yes on being spending more time being a dad. \n\nHaving said that, he has improved dramatically recently and the more I\u2019m reflecting the more I think this will add to his upset.  \n\nThank you, these points will help me understand and talk it through with him productively", "I think you got a bit carried away here. I have worked my butt off to prepay two months rent in advance for being away on Mat leave and we have organised for all payments until I\u2019m back to work again. He also works, as I\u2019ve said. This will just impact us hard for the short period of maternity leave because I contribute the most financially. So while we absolutely need to make anything we can now to make it easier and make sure we don\u2019t stress and struggle, its the responsible thing to do, it\u2019s not quite right to assume there has been zero prep, we have zero income, and are just generally all around negligent in the face of having a newborn\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t actually address the points asked in the AITA. \n\nI appreciate insight to help gain understanding and his perspective, so thank you I guess. Interesting to see another\u2019s perception", "Nta, if he can't handle a doctor visit he has no business being a parent", "NTA... you are both parents. Only one is necessary per visit. Your plumbing has nothing to do with your ability.", "YTA. \n\nEveryone here is ignoring the fact that you\u2019ve failed to get your driver\u2019s license for 2.5 years. There\u2019s no way \u201csomething always comes up\u201d for 2.5 years. \n\nMy husband couldn\u2019t drive for the first few years of our relationship. At first I didn\u2019t mind driving him everywhere, but it started to get exhausting after a while being his personal taxi.

So his wife has to leave work every single time her kid is sick or has a doctor\u2019s appointment because her husband can\u2019t drive. At the very least she expects her husband to ride along. But one day she gets exhausted and frustrated because she\u2019s the one doing all the driving and she gets told by her husband, \u201cYou\u2019re capable of doing this yourself, ya know.\u201d\n\nIf the genders were flipped, Reddit would be calling you out no problem. \n\nYeah, I\u2019d be furious. \n\nYou\u2019re an adult, too. Get your driver\u2019s license so you can handle the transportation for some of these appointments.", "The fuck? ALL of my friends' hubs have been hands on, diaper changing, carpooling, etc-ing for their kids. Is this some new millenial shit or a patriarchal culture?", "What? Driving is literally the easiest part of the whole thing! He doesn't get the kid ready, he just plays UPS man and delivers the package to and from home. And is such a baby that he wasted time to go home and get OP instead of just getting kid from daycare, going to dr and then going home. That's 100% on him, not her.", "So you make all the money, do most of the child rearing, and manage the household.\n\nDoes your husband do anything but flail around angrily when he's cornered on why he's useless?", "YTA ESH", "NTA. Whenever our daughter needs to go to the Dr, I, the dad, take a day off work and take her myself. Usually make an outing of it so its not a negative for her. Your husband is playing incompetent.
