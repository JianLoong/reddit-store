So on that part you were a bit of an AH. \n\nEveryone wants to blame everyone else for the problems with overhead storage, but particularly when I used to fly economy most of the time, the amount of luggage that people try to bring on / are allowed to bring on is just ridiculous and it makes the process fraught with negatives.", "No, 100% not an arsehole.\n\nFucking hate those people who think their smart put their stuff in business yet sit in the back of the plane.", "Nta. \n\n1.

I've seen a lot more of this in the last few years than I remember pre-covide, but maybe that's just the airline(s) and routes.", "NTA you paid for that seat and the overhead compartment for that seat.

Also the tone in your post suggests that you're often an AH.\n\nActually, I'm changing my mind: soft YTA.", "NTA when checking a bag or two was included in the price the overhead space wasn\u2019t at the premium it currently is.  You had every right to expect all of the perks for paying for a premium ticket. \n\nTo those people who want to make it into a rich/poor thing I disagree.  Someone who flies economy is not necessarily poorer than someone in business class.  They may be someone who prefers to spend the extra money on something else, or they could be traveling for work.  Some of the people in business class may have saved up points to get the upgrade from credit card purchases or through work related travel.  Sometimes health problems make the extra space and comfort a necessity, rather than a luxury.  So to make it purely into a rich/vs poor thing is not truly as accurate. Instead it\u2019s more of being willing to spend more money or points to get a bigger seat, more leg room, and all the other perks that the airlines hope you will be willing to pay extra for.  If someone chooses not to spend the extra money they shouldn\u2019t expect to get the perks.", "NTA. When you pay for business class, one of the things that\u2019s supposed to include is peace of mind that your carry on has overhead space.

This is also backed up by your point saying the FA said they should have been more watchful. Sounds like the passenger would have put his bags in your space regardless as he would have felt it's less likely they would be moved and when the plane lands he'll say his bags are in business class and use that as an excuse to disembark first. Flight attendants should be instructed to automatically put these bags in hold so it prevents people from pulling this crap. So many times I'm boarding a flight and I see people with 3 or 4 \"carry on\" bags. Either be consistent as they are going through check in and security or just let everyone bring everything as a carry on and it's a winner takes all when you get on the plane", "I hate people that put their carryons up front then go sit in the back.

They don\u2019t want to have to carry it from the back.  The problem is then the person near the front has their bag near the back and has to fight to get back to it when getting off the plane.  This delays everyone from embarking.\n\nAlso, I have never seen them gate check an economy bag if it could fit in a premium overhead.  The FAs try to make things fit.

And regardless of \"class,\" it wasn't his bag to handle. The economy passenger was already asking him to be careful. Why was OP not on the plane before the other passenger, being business class and all?

Bag handlers got much worse at losing bags and most airlines charge fees for nearly every bag. Add in the ridiculous entitlement many people have while flying now and you have a recipe for a shit storm every time.\n\nStrict adherence to rules is the only fair way to keep it all in check. OP was willing to make it work, sounded like they were probably going to sacrifice one of their bags to under the seat. That only changed when they realized it was all due to someone else trying to cheat the system.\n\nOP is NTA here.", "Then why not ESH? Only OP was an AH here? That person did not follow the rules, but they thought they were more important than everyone else. They did not handle it poorly, the person in 2nd economy did. They didn't even care to look for a spot close to them and they didn't read the placard for business travelers only.\n\nWho cares what's in bag? If it was important, why didn't they try to get the bag in a storage bin closer to them? Since you've been on a flight before, you would hopefully know that once you're at your seat there's really no way to go back up to get your bag until you're getting off. So they INTENTIONALLY put it there without even looking for other storage closer to them.\n\nIf I paid for a premium seat with premium storage, I should be able to access all amenities of that tier.

Like, getting them in trouble with the authority on the plane rather than just resolving it yourself. It's \"less confrontational\" in that you've offloaded the confrontation to a third party so you don't have to look the person you're mad at in the face directly, but it causes more conflict and is an escalation of the situation.", "OP edited it to say that the other bag wouldn't have fit after he put his bags in.", "I have seen people in front of me do this on almost every single flight I have been on.

Dude back in economy could have paid more if they cared more about their bag and their bags safety. You\u2019re on a giant tube being blasted through the air.

But he was willing to make it work and fit both until realizing they were in economy. I get that he paid for the spot, but he did that because he was in a position to pay.

He was not loud or vulgar, and ultimately he handed over his bag, but just would not let it go and kept saying how it\u2019s unfair and telling the flight attendants they were wrong to make him gate check his bag.

Sometimes they even move the bags themselves. \n\nThey might have assumed this guy was going to be a no show and that first class was done boarding, because remember first class boards first and this dude was one of the last to get on a plane. And first class passengers are the most likely to not have carry on bags, because a lot of them are traveling between homes where they maintain a separate wardrobes or they are just flying somewhere for the day. \n\nSo it\u2019s very possible that the economy class dude did not sneak his bag into the first class overhead storage space was given permission to use it.
