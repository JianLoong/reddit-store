You should find someone who wants the same future as you instead of trying to convince someone they want something they clearly don\u2019t want. \n\nIf he\u2019s upset you\u2019re not doing acts of service for him anymore, does he value you as a person?

Not wanting to \"go the whole nine yards\" sounds like you know this probably isn't going to last.  You don't have compatible ideas about your future and until those are resolved, nothing is going to change.\n\nI hate to say it, but after four years together, if he isn't interested in marriage and you are, maybe it's time to say goodbye to the relationship.

You are not the one.  Cut your losses and find someone who wants to marry you!", "NTA - he says he wants partnership in the house but it sounds like you did the majority of it? So it sounds like he wants the benefits of a \"traditional home\" without pulling his end of the bargain. \n\nAlso why is he with you if he doesn't trust you after 4 years?? It could be that his divorce is impacting this and he may need counselling after his divorce.\n\nIt's okay that you want to be on the same page as each other, and it's also okay if you guys want different things - but in the latter you need to make a hard decision if you're willing to compromise or go out there and find a better match for you.", "If marriage is a deal breaker for you. Don\u2019t waste more time with him. He has no plans marrying you.", ">Am I the Asshole because I really don't want to do that until I know we are on the same page?\n\nNTA but if you think this man is going to change his mind on marriage, then you are naive. He has clearly stated now that he has no interest in marrying you. I am sorry, I know it hurts, but believe him and move on. No amount of you cleaning and doing dishes is going to change his mind. If you really want to get married and have a partner that shares household duties, then you will need to find a new partner.", "NTA. You let him know that marriage was important to you, that's when he had the opportunity to tell you he wasn't really interested in getting married again... not 4 years in. The fact that after 4 years he doesn't trust you... speaks volumes. Personally dont think I could trust him since he has lied for 4 years. Either way, he needs to deal with his shit before you can move forward, if you even want to. You deserve better.", "Nta, it's time to say goodbye. Don't punish him for his  life decision.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't move in together until over 3 years into the relationship, have only been living together for like 6 months, and now things are far worse? How many red flags do you need? Add on top of that he doesn't want what you want and he doesn't trust you and is hiding things from you. What are you doing? Who gives a damn about chores, time to go... Sorry to be blunt, but it sounds like you are torturing yourself for a payoff that is never going to come.", "NTA. You want different things and aren't compatible.  He's  even admitted to not trusting you. This isn't a partnership and there's no hope of marriage, move on.", ">I told him all of this and how I feel, and he said that he wants \"partnership\" and more help around the house. \n\nYou're not compatible.", "NAH. You're both allowed to have preferences. You just need to talk it through and decide whether you can find a common ground, and whether your relationship is going to work out.", "ESH conditionally\n\nYou're not on the same page, even though he gave you reason to think you might be. I would suggest ending the relationship at this point unless you make the decision that staying with someone who doesn't trust you or want to marry you is OK (I'm guessing not). You're not going to change his mind.\n\nThe condition is how much of the housework are you slacking on? If you are doing your part, as you say, and the workload is split fairly evenly, then you're N T A. If he is doing less because you did more of it before you were working and it just feels like you're slacking to him, then he is definitely T A. As long as you're both living there and both working, the split should be pretty even. If you are not doing your fair share, and doing so intentionally, then Y T A.\n\nBut seriously, get out of there and start over.", "ESH\n\nThe fact he doesn't trust you around his mail seems ultra dodgy. What does he fear you will do? Open it and steal his identity? Why did he agree to moving in together if he doesn't trust people around his mail?\n\nI don't think it's right that you started slacking around the house because he doesn't want marriage. If you live together you both need to do chores (assuming you both also work).\n\nHe's told you he does not want marriage. You say you want marriage. If neither of you change your view on this, this relationship is going nowhere and you are just wasting your time and his time. Is there a middle ground like a legal partnership of sorts? That way you might have some legal protections that you would have if you were married but it would not be marriage exactly. Could you be happy with that? Could he? If you can't agree on something, stop wasting your time. If marriage is a must have for you, I would look for potential partners in communities that value the same thing.", "ESH. The way to deal with a fundamentally incompatable relationship isn't to passive-aggressively refuse to do stuff until he agrees to do what you want, it's to end the relationship. I'm not discounting the depression element in the beginning, don't get me wrong, but given you're actively acknowledging this is now what you're doing, that's an asshole move.  \n\n\nThe whole top part is hard, because \"sounded like we wanted mutual things\" isn't necessarily an agreement or disagreement to marriage. Without knowing the details of what was said, it's hard to tell if he lied to you, or if there was just a misunderstanding or miscommunication between you in those early stages, which is why I'm kind of hedging on whether that actually makes anyone the asshole.  \n\n\nHiding his mail actually hits a sore spot with me. I had an ex who would open my mail, despite me making it clear that it wasn't okay with me, and at one point an expensive gift went missing which was sent to me. I don't *know* if she took it, but because she couldn't respect that boundary, I could never fully trust that she didn't. I don't know what the situation was that led to his behaviour, but if he'd been through something like that, I could have some understanding of it. Did you ever ask or explore why that in particular was an issue for him?  \n\n\nBut the whole thing blowing up to the point where you aren't talking sounds toxic, and doesn't sound good in terms of either of your communication skills.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
