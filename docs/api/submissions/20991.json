Leila has been maintaining her active lifestyle throughout her pregnancy, including regular workouts at the gym. She has taken all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of herself and our baby, with the full support and knowledge of her doctor.\n\nA few weeks ago, my brother, \"Dan,\" joined the same gym as Leila. The first time he noticed her, he approached her during her working out and began bombarding her with invasive questions. He asked things like, \"Does your husband know you're working out like this?\" or \"Did you know your baby will be born with several deformations?\" or \"Do you not care about your health?\" Leila initially tried to handle it politely, but eventually, her friend (her workout partner) stepped in and told Dan to fuck off.\n\nSince that incident, we have not spoken to Dan. I assumed his disrespectful behavior was a one-time occurrence driven by ignorance.\n\nYesterday was my sister's birthday dinner.  Most of our extended family was present, and at first, everything seemed to be going well. \n\nLate into the evening, Dan approached Leila and offered her a glass of wine. She politely declined but he kept pushing for it. He said things like, \"Come on, just a little won't hurt.\" or \"It's not as if you care about your health anyway.\" or \"You've already broken all the rules of pregnancy, you don't care.\"\n\nThe entire time Leila was smiling, being polite, but saying no. I got tired of Dan not listening so I told him to leave her alone and offer his wine to someone who wants to drink. \n\nDan seemed to get very angry. He started getting angry and berating her, in front of everyone, for working out while pregnant. He said, \"If the bitch wants to kill her baby by lifting weights, a fucking drink won't harm anyone.\" \n\nI told him that he was acting like a \"creepy fucking asshole,\" and that he needed to simply go fuck himself. Everyone was silent and Leila and I quickly left. \n\nMy sister texted me the next morning and told me that I shouldn't have gotten angry like that in front of everyone. She says that I overreacted to a drunk man rambling. \n\nI think I should have handled the situation with a bit more class.", "created_utc": 1688144726, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14n61kn/aita_for_calling_my_brother_a_creepy_fucking/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He just assumes it's not good for the baby & berates her without facts.  And then to try to force her to drink alcohol?  What is wrong with him?  It sickens me that nobody else stuck up for her & that your sis is siding with your bro.  Time to go NC with your bro.  If this is how he is acting now, how will he be when the baby gets here?
