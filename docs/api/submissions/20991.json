The first time he noticed her, he approached her during her working out and began bombarding her with invasive questions. He asked things like, \"Does your husband know you're working out like this?\" or \"Did you know your baby will be born with several deformations?\" or \"Do you not care about your health?\" Leila initially tried to handle it politely, but eventually, her friend (her workout partner) stepped in and told Dan to fuck off.\n\nSince that incident, we have not spoken to Dan. I assumed his disrespectful behavior was a one-time occurrence driven by ignorance.\n\nYesterday was my sister's birthday dinner.  Most of our extended family was present, and at first, everything seemed to be going well. \n\nLate into the evening, Dan approached Leila and offered her a glass of wine. She politely declined but he kept pushing for it. He said things like, \"Come on, just a little won't hurt.\" or \"It's not as if you care about your health anyway.\" or \"You've already broken all the rules of pregnancy, you don't care.\"\n\nThe entire time Leila was smiling, being polite, but saying no. I got tired of Dan not listening so I told him to leave her alone and offer his wine to someone who wants to drink. \n\nDan seemed to get very angry. He started getting angry and berating her, in front of everyone, for working out while pregnant. He said, \"If the bitch wants to kill her baby by lifting weights, a fucking drink won't harm anyone.\" \n\nI told him that he was acting like a \"creepy fucking asshole,\" and that he needed to simply go fuck himself. Everyone was silent and Leila and I quickly left. \n\nMy sister texted me the next morning and told me that I shouldn't have gotten angry like that in front of everyone.

Drunk or sober, that man needs to be put in his place.", "NTA\nYou didn\u2019t react to \u201ca drunk man rambling\u201d because he said all of the same things at the gym (where he presumably was sober). You\u2019re a good man and standing up for your wife.", "NTA He needed a strong statement to understand he was out of line since he wasn't listening to the repeated classy ones!", "NTA. But he called your pregnant wife a bitch and that\u2019s all you said? I\u2019m sorry but he\u2019s either jealous you are having a kid or has a major thing for your wife. You need to do more cause that sentence wasn\u2019t enough.", "YTA for not ripping him a new one right after what he  said at the gym. He was harassing your wife dude, you shouldn't have wasted time telling him off.", "More class? Fuck that you should have laid him out.  NTA", "NTA - I'd have lent my brother a crisp punch to the jaw.", "NTA", "Honestly, I wish you would have been MORE of an ahole to your brother. FOR 1 YOU DONT SAY THOSE KIND OF THINGS TO A WOMAN... EVER... PREGNANT OR NOT.\n2. you don't call your SIL \"the bitch\" for doing something you, A MAN, know not enough about. \n3. When someone says no.... it means no.\n4. The rest of your family saying you overreacted are AH's too.... absolutely ridiculous. \n\nMy specialist and Dr team (yes team) told me (re:physical activity).. if you were doing it before pregnancy and your body is used to it, you can continue to do it. So.... with that being said.... NTA.", "NTA.\nBut what the fuck is up with your brother?? \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40", "NTA\n\nDO NOT let your brother anywhere near your wife for the rest of her pregnancy. He is unhinged. He's not just creepy; he's obsessed. Your wife is not safe in his presence.", "NTA and honestly he deserved worse.\n\nhis obsession with your wife's pregnancy is weird and disturbing. it's one thing giving advice from a place of caring and doing whatever the hell he was doing.\n\nother than that, he should educate himself before opening his mouth", "NTA, your brother seems to have issues with you or your wife to have reacted like that in both occurrences (or is a AH, sometimes there are no other explanations!)", "First , your sister needs a swift kick, second, your brother is possessed.", "NTA. I would've beat his ass personally.", "NTA. Your brother is a massive AH, and honestly, you were more restrained than you should have been given the circumstances.", "NTA Think you were BOTH extremely reserved & calm, if it had been me (pregnant woman) I would\u2019ve ended up taking the drink & throwing it in his face which also wouldn\u2019t have been the best reaction but believe warranted, considering. Why is your sister making excuses for your brother? As if being drunk makes it ok to act so inappropriately? Did your brother always have a problem with your wife? His entire reaction from the gym to the birthday party is really off & doesn\u2019t make sense. Did he have a wife or SO who had a miscarriage or is he in a relationship & they are having difficulty getting pregnant? Asking because his behavior doesn\u2019t make sense & is really obnoxious. Think both you & your wife deserve an apology from both your siblings.", "Nta you held back which in itself is impressive. He deserved alot more to be honest. He is an idiot. Doctors recommend exercise during pregnancy. If her doc is cool with what she is doing, that's all that matters. Your brother is a massive asshole.", "NTA. Yous brother sounds like he wants to fuck your wife and is mad about her not giving in, especially when she is pregnant. \u201cHow dare she is hot and pregnant??!!! 1111???She is supposed to be fat and ugly, how the hell am I going to feel better about me not getting laid???\" is probably what he thinks.", "My thoughts exactly. He called OP\u2019s wife a bitch and OP was wrong to react? Oh hell no!!", "I would have thrown hands, OP is a saint", "Same for the wife, she should've thrown the wine in his face lol", "Nevermind what I would've thought, said, or done. In that situation my ex-wife would've broken his damn nose, and I would've laughed.", "He wasn't drunk at the gym so I doubt he was drunk at the gathering. Just a dick and OP was too lenient.", "NTA, but I disagree that a lesser person would have slapped Dan. Dan was engaging in a kind of speech most reasonable people would call \u201cfighting words\u201d and an invitation to mutual combat. OP could have thrown the first punch and been legally in the clear in many courtrooms.\n\nHis mouth was writing checks, to be cashed by his body. Dan\u2019s problem if his body can\u2019t cash those checks, but too late to know unless he does it again.", "Yes! Perfectly said", "N A H is no one is the ahole", "Tbf, having to bail her husband out of jail probably doesn't need to be added to the wife's list of current stressors", "[removed]", "Right?! \"Drunk men rambling\" deserve what they get anything else sounds like enabling bad behavior to me!", "[removed]", "He deserved a good slap. In the face. With a chair.", "Punch in the throat", "Yeah, I saw another forum or article about exercise, hard labor, etc, that if the mother was doing it before they were pregnant and the pregnancy is healthy, they could keep doing it. My mom knew a nurse whose water broke on the floor while she was working. I have heard that starting prenatal vitamins before getting pregnant can also be helpful, but I know I need to research that one more personally.\n\nIf able, moving around before and after birth can be very good for the mom and the baby. Abdominal muscles help a lot with the last part of digestion and walking moves fluids around, which allows for the replacement of old fluids with new fluids.\n\nWalking, when safe, is often times encouraged.", "My grandmother, having a healthy, uncomplicated pregnancy, waxed her linoleum floor and walked about 2km and change to her doctor's office and back home the day she gave birth. \n\nI choose to go with (unless I have obvious proof to the contrary) the idea that a pregnant  person knows what they can and can't do for their health/the health of their child.", "Speaking of the gym aren't pregnant women supposed to exercise??? Im pretty sure they only tell you to avoid certain exercises and don't overdo it unless you have some kind of medical problem.", "[I got some bad news for you, buddy](https://wisevoter.com/state-rankings/mutual-combat-states/)\n\nBeyond that, do you *really* want the police coming to your family event? Doesn't seem like the best idea", "\u201cOk sure \u2018drunk man rambling\u2019 so was he drunk at the gym, or\u2026?\u201d\n\nNTA, OP. Keep the creep away from your wife, well done", "It was her birthday and she didn't want anyone to rock the boat.", "He speaks like someone who\u2019s never been hit before", "This is terrible advice. All that would do is get him in legal trouble. OP handled it in the best way without causing harm or legal issues.", "Well Dan started rocking the boat in the first place by being an asshole", "Defending your spouse from unwarranted malevolence is not \"rocking the boat\", it's an act of love."]}
