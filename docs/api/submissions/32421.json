We've been doing this for about 6 years now.\n\nWe go to the same resort town every year and get a 3 bedroom airbnb (we share room #1, his mom and sister share room #2, and his uncle gets his own room #3). We split the Airbnb evenly PER PERSON, not per room.\n\n All rooms are similar in size, all come with a bathroom and it's usually about $300 each. Everyone is responsible for their own food. I know most people split by rooms but we have always done this so bare with me (spoiler yes this is where the issue comes in).\n\nLast year my SIL (30F) started dating Jake (30M) and invited him on the annual vacation. \n\nMy husband's mom and uncle did not want to share a room, so we looked at 4 bedroom airbnbs (so there would be one room for us, one for SIL and her bf, one for uncle, one for mom).\n\nBut the cost would be about $500 per person and uncle and mom thought this was too high. They are both on budgets and always want the accommodations to be $300 or less for their share, which we have always been able to do.\n\nSo we decided to stick with the 3 bedroom, and uncle would do a pullout couch in the living room, mom would do third bedroom. Total cost was about $1500. We EACH paid $270 except for uncle who paid $150 since he did not have a room. Mom raised a stink about this because she felt she should pay less too. We explained to her that she is still paying less for the same amount of SPACE since she has a full bedroom.\n\nAgain this is per person - so for our room, my husband I paid $540 total. SIL and her bf paid $540 for a room. Mom paid $270 for a room. Uncle paid $150, had no room. Hope this is making sense so far. My brain hurts writing all thus out lol\n\nVacation comes and it's a mess. We can't use the living space because uncle is very messy and sleeps in, turns out SIL's bf is annoying to be in close living spaces with and eats other people's food, just alot of issues.\n\nWe are now planning for this year's vacation and my husband and I would like to get a seperate airbnb altogether because of how bad last year was. \n\nSIL and her bf are annoyed about this and said we will ruin family vacation because mom and uncle will not be able to afford it since there would be 2 less people splitting the bill. They said it also changes the dynamic since we will be in different spaces (our rental would be about a 5 min drive away). \n\nThey want to do thr 3 bedroom airbnb again so everyone has their own room, so it would be 1500 again. Splitting per person would make it $375 each. Mom and uncle are upset about this, saying it's over budget, etc. They just want to do exactly what we did last year.\n\nMy husband and I do not want a repeat of last year. We want to keep our plan of getting a seperate airbnb, and let mom, uncle, SIL and her bf sort out the issues with their plans among themselves. If they can't figure it out and can't go, we do still plan on going.

But I'm genuinely wondering what the end game is here. It seems to me like the strict budget for mom/uncle might make the trip entirely unviable for them, which isn't really something you've taken into account. It seems like you should just plan a vacation with your husband and abandon the family trip altogether.", "NTA - These are a number of people leveraging your participation in an activity to lower their cost, trying to manipulate you into keeping things the same so they can afford it.  \n\n\nThey're so selfish that whether or not you're even enjoying yourself or happy with the arrangements isn't even a concern of theirs.   \n\n\nThey need you to go on vacation, you don't need them. Either way, if you stay separately, or just decide you don't want to go, they can't afford to to go. So you not participating is the death stroke to family vacation.  \n\n\nBut that doesn't mean you should suck it up and tolerate annoying sleeping arrangements on what is supposed to be a vacation.", "NTA", "Considering that family vacation has been an enjoyable thing for a long time, I think you should push harder for a 4-bed house instead of choosing a separate place. 5 minutes away or not, it does change the dynamic of how you spend time together.  And it also gives off an obvious vibe of \"we don't like SIL's boyfriend.\"\n\nIf the others absolutely refuse because of the higher cost of the 4-bed, then splitting the cost more unevenly to subsidize your mother/uncle would be something to consider. \n\nNAH, just the usual vacation planning strife.  Different lodgings might be just a couple hundred bucks in one direction or the other for some people, I wouldn't want to wreck good relationships over it.", "NTA I see 3 options 1. mom & uncle need to share a room with 2 double beds  2. you need 4 bedrooms 3.

They want to do exactly what you all did last year but you don't, and I don't blame you.  The dynamic and arrangement has changed with the addition of another person, and it's changed in ways that make it less enjoyable for you.  You are being very gracious in trying to make it still work to the best of your ability, but your family seems only worried about the finances and not about you and your husband comfortability.  You are spending good money too and deserve to be comfortable and enjoy your vacation.", "Good lord - with planning in advance, everyone should be able to save the additional money for either a 4 bedroom for all or a 3 bedroom for SIL, boyfriend, mom & uncle.  These folks need to act like adults & stop whining.  NTA", "NTA. You are allowed to enjoy your vacation. Your family splitting the costs a weird way and the boyfriend being problematic (I mean the food stealing) is not your issue at this point.

Can they go off-season a bit so the cost would come down? Some places June or September, when kids are in school, areas are still great, but it's a little bit less to stay.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not a discussion, you're willing and able to foot your own bill for your own space.

No point going on vacation if it's miseable.", "NTA they could get a 2 bedroom and let uncle sleep on pull out problem solved", "Umm. . . you don't really HAVE TO go on this family vacation at all, you know.

Kind of ridiculous.", "We are going off season! Trip is in March for ocean front. This is mostly because of MIL and uncles $300 budget for accommodations.

We caught him several times, very awkward. \n\nHe also helped himself to soy free desserts I had bought just for myself and drank alot of our alcohol without asking, would just take from the fridge. \n\nHe was very aware everyone was responsible for their own food and bev and it was not \"family style\". \n\nIf i had to describe him in one sentence id say he is the person who orders the most food at a restaurant and then wants to split the bill evenly.

Our own airbnb would be slightly more (we only need a one bedroom so the costs are pretty similar). But we are paying that extra amount in exchange for peace.\n\nMy husband doesn't want to pay more just to have a repeat of last year. This would be a good solution otherwise but paying even more and being miserable is what we are so stuck on.", "I did find some other options that were within budget and everyone shot them down because they would have to sacrifice on something else they want (oceanfront view, location walkable to a restaurant we like, dog friendly and so on).\n\nMom and uncle won't budge on budget and think since SIL has the \"extra\" guest they shouldn't be responsible for any extra costs as a result.

If uncle bring in a room would help, it could make sense, but if the whole experience was miserable, it won't help."]}
