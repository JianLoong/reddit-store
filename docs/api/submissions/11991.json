I\u2019m not ultra conservative but I\u2019m also not going to wander around braless when I have family visiting either. It would make them uncomfortable and I want to be respectful of that. It\u2019s okay for both of you to have different preferences and comfort levels and a mature perspective is for both of you to be respectful of each other in that arena. Or move because this is just going to get ugly fast.\n\nAlso, the free baby-sitting. If someone else is caring for your child (for free!) they are helping to raise them and you either need to be okay with how they\u2019re doing it or pay for someone else to raise them how you would want. In an ideal world your in-laws would respect your parenting style but this isn\u2019t an ideal world so be prepared for that.\n\nAlso look into marriage and family counseling because y\u2019all are going to need it. Husband needs help backing up his wife, you both need help establishing boundaries and healthy communication with the in-laws.
