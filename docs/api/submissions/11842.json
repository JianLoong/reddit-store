I am currently in therapy for it and have been in therapy for 6 months now, and it's getting better, but I'm still working on things. Earlier today, I had one of the worst panic attacks that I've had in a while. This attack left me on the floor crying and basically made me feel like I was suffocating. My fiance found me on the floor and explained to him what was wrong(this attack was triggered over something very serious to me and very personal to me). He comforted me the best he could, and I really appreciated it. \n\nAbout 2 hours ago, some of our family and some of our friends came over for a dinner that we have been pushing off for quite some time, but decided a few weeks ago that today would be a good idea. Although I didn't feel well after everything had happened, I thought it would have been unfair to move the dinner party once again, especially while it was very last minute. So I put on my big girl pants and hosted a dinner. I want to say that maybe 45 minutes in, one of our friends is talking about her experience with something, and that somehow prompts my fiance to make a joke about my panic attack earlier. Everyone laughed, except for my two cousins that were there. I felt extremely embarrassed and I asked him to stop. He then went on to say, \"I'm just joking\" and continued to joke/talk about it. I pulled him aside and reinformed him that there was a very serious reasoning behind the attack and that it wasn't funny to me. He told me that I was being dramatic and that I was stopping everyone from having fun, so I left. I grabbed my car keys and I drove 3 cities over to my parents' house. My cousins followed me out, and I plan on staying at my parents for the time being because I just felt so betrayed by him. I felt like I trusted him with such a vulnerable thing, and he went and made a joke of it.\n\nI've received calls from our friends and him telling me that it wasn't a big deal and that I shouldn't have left. He told me that I was the AH for storming out in front of our friends. My family doesn't think I'm in the wrong, but I'm having inner conflict over it.", "created_utc": 1678331481, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mh16x/aita_for_getting_upset_that_my_fiance_shared_a/", "score": 211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is not a good person if this is how he treats your illness.", "NTA - I\u2019m struggling to see how anyone would find him making jokes about you having a panic attack anything but horribly uncomfortable. I don\u2019t think I could have been one of the friends in that situation and not called him out on that. \n\nSeems to me that you need to be considering whether this is a rare lapse in judgement on his part or something that would continue if the relationship does.", "NTA. He's telling you something very honest about himself: he doesn't see mental health or private moments as what they are. That he can joke about such is bad; that he kept doing so is a red flag. That he then doubled down and called you \"dramatic\" is just the icing on the cake.", "NTA\n\n>He then went on to say, \"I'm just joking\" and continued to joke/talk about it.\n\nI would have hesitated to call anyone an asshole until this line.

And I say 'his friends', because if they think it's okay to treat you that way, they are not *your* friends.\n\nYour family is being supportive because they recognize that this was a betrayal.

This is horrifying behavior from someone who should have your best interests at heart.  \n\nIf you struggle with anxiety now - imagine how bad it will be after being gaslit by this AH repeatedly and told that your feelings don't matter, ever.  This situation will never get better.  He's just going to wear down your confidence and your mental health repeatedly - without remorse.  You deserve so much better.\n\nPlease kick him to the curb - for your own health and mental safety.", "NTA. When someone tells you that you hurt them, you don't get to decide you didn't hurt them.

Is this really someone you want to spend the rest of your life with?", "It sounds like a lack of communication styles. You have a stressful event and have a panic attack. Totally no big deal...people have them all the time. No need to feel stressed or embarrassed about them. Meanwhile he\u2019s involved in a stressful event and he turns to dark humor. This can be a normal response for people too. Unfortunately these two communication situations aren\u2019t exactly compatible. NTA for leaving and removing yourself (seriously it could have prompted another panic attack which wouldn\u2019t have been pleasant for anyone...especially you). It was a smart move!

It may be entirely possible that he didn't mean to hurt you- but when you told him how negatively affected you were by the way he was acting he should have shown you respect and stopped.

What does make HIM the asshole in this situation, is that after the fact, you pulled him aside, clearly told him that it upset you and expressed a boundary that he then invalidated, dismissed and made out like YOU were the problem. This definitely isn't the case. Like I said, people deal with things in different ways and cracking jokes about painful things does NOT work for everyone and he should have respected that, validated your feelings, realised he made a misjudgment, genuinely apologised for the comment and then assured you he would not do something like that again. \n\nI'm not going to make big claims about the nature of the relationship as a whole - as I don't know if this type of behaviour from him is common or if this is a one-off (we all fuck up and do dipshit stuff here and there).
