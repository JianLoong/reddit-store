Like--exactly--a party of bigger kids that looks really fun but that is not for them. Or a toy in the store that they saw on TV that Mom can't afford! Or a really cool toy that their friend has and they don't! Or a construction site that's too dangerous for them to go look at the awesome giant diggers and cranes up close. Or a visible trampoline belonging to a neighbor you haven't even met yet, or an amusement park you drive past etc etc etc.\n\nAnd 3 years old is kind of the hot spot for this really. They're too old to be easily distracted and too young to accept reality.

And you have to explain the facts in the simplest way you can and make it clear they're unbudgeable. *That is a big kids' party. Sorry.*\n\nBut this lady doesn't want to deal with tears. She's one of those parents who believe that parenting is about keeping the child happy 100% of the time... and/or she just doesn't want to deal with the bad feelings she gets when her kid cries. She takes her kid's feelings as reality: if he feels sad, someone's screwed up. By basing her parenting on that she's going to screw *him* up, sadly. But because the rest of the world won't generally yield to her ways, he won't be entirely screwed up--he'll learn there are some boundaries in life.\n\nSo, it's good of you to feel bad for the experience he had, but don't feel bad.

I usually told the parents of the kids with little ones to bring their tots over once the party appeared to be winding down and guests were leaving. They could play in the bounce house without us worrying about the bigger kids landing on them, and have some cake and ice cream. I always stressed for them NOT to bring a gift, although some did anyway. We always got some sort of inflatable--bounce house, obstacle course, or a big water slide, and it would've been hard for the littles to see this going on and not get to participate at all. \n\nBut a little kid playing the games OP was talking about with older, bigger kids? That's a recipe for disaster. Worst of all was the neighbor's attitude.", "[removed]", "yep. she didn\u2019t actually want anything. her kid was melting down, she was frazzled, she lashed out. op should not feel bad. i think this was less about entitlement and more about anger issues. nta, keep your distance.", "Now you have a reason not to invite him; he might bug her for processed garbage", "[removed]", "My auntie\u2019s neighbour kept sending her child over to play without really checking it was ok.
