One minute Mommy is the nicest person in the world, the next minute she is screaming and yelling about something \n\n\nGood luck with your new neighbor.", "OMG - you are absolutely NTA. Birthday parties are for friends and family. And your neighbors are neither. Instead, your neighbors are entitled, holier than thou AH who seem to be living in an alternate reality. If she is too weak to say \u201cwe don\u2019t know them, we can\u2019t go to their party.  But you\u2019ll get to go to lots of parties.\u201d Then her kid is going to grow up to face a lifetime of disappointment. \n\nSaying it again - NTA", "NTA - Why would you invite someone you nor your niece knows?", "NTA, your niece doesn\u2019t even know the kid !", "NTA they are not entitled to any kind of invite to whatever event you throw in your home.", "NTA. She's being Entitled. Why would you invite a strangers kid from next door to your Niece's birthday party, when she doesn't even know them?", "NTA your neighbor is being entitled. \nOmg she\u2019s pissed they weren\u2019t invited and then scoffed at the offer of cake. \n\nSounds like she is trying to make an enemy. Oof. Throw more parties and don\u2019t invite them lol.", "NTA Your neighbor is being ridiculous. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Even when you offered to let her son come over she gave you a reason why he couldn\u2019t come over. Your neighbor is being insanely rude for acting that entitled towards you. Even if her son could come over, I wouldn\u2019t let anyone\u2019s child over at my house if the parent acted like that towards me and my family.", "NTA\n\nYour niece does not know the kid and he is not even in her age. Just because they are kids and you are neighbours it does not mean you have to invite each other. Did she invite your niece to her son\u2018s last birthday? Also she just could have ask nicely if her son could come over for some time or better she could have encouraged her son to ask himself if he could join. Would be so much nicer in so many ways then just starting to make a fass about your party.", "Are you kidding? NTA. What you do in your own home in your own private time is of no import to your neighbor's kids tantrum, and you do not have to accept responsibility for it. Rather, your neighbor has a responsibility to set a limit and explain why he is not at that party.", "NTA. I wouldn't invite a kid that was throwing a large tantrum even if we did know him.", "NTA your neighbour is a weirdo, best not interact with them imagine you had that kid over and they started finding fault with your set up and causing even more trouble \n\nNo way", "NTAH  It\u2019s real easy to see where this kid\u2019s life is going.", "Nta. Ignore her and move on", "NTA.\n\nSo, your neighbor gets upset that their child wasn\u2019t invited to a birthday for a child they don\u2019t know. Then, they criticize the food you were serving at the same party?! That\u2019s entitlement to the extreme. \n\nForget your neighbor. And, at the rate they\u2019re going, their child soon won\u2019t be invited to any party.", "NTA, it\u2019s a worthwhile lesson for the boy to learn that he isn\u2019t invited to everything. His mother needs to learn how to handle his expectations better. He doesn\u2019t even know your niece.\n\n It was kind of you to invite him for cake.", "NTA. Living next door to someone throwing a party does not justify the entitled behavior. SHE is responsible for her sons feelings, not you. SHE should be consoling him instead of attacking you. Even if you DID know them better you are never required to invite someone. Wow\u2026 that woman seems like she will blame anyone else for her problems", "NTA you barely know them, your niece doesn't, the children are older and you don't owe the neighbors anything.", "NTA\n\nPersonally I would have just told them to come over, let her deal with her son not being able to keep up with the games, but that's the \"people pleaser\" in me. Her son felt left out, she wanted to defend her son. You're NTA, she is for how she dealt with it. It's hard to have shitty neighbors", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
