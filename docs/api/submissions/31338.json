She\u2019s taken my son with her to the store with her multiple times with my brother and every single time has returned with toys for my brother and none for my son. My brother is also stingy with toys, which they\u2019re his so hey it is what it is but it\u2019s disappointing seeing the look on my sons face and hearing him cry over it.

Anyways, she asked to keep my son for a week with my brother and I blatantly told her \u201cno.\u201d And had to repeat myself a few times as she tried to convince me. Eventually she gave up and said I was ungrateful & an asshole for not giving her the chance to bond but I feel she\u2019s had plenty of chances already. I just hung up but since then my dad, uncle & gmas bf have also said I was being mean. So, am I?\n\nEDIT : I should\u2019ve been more specific. A Slap on the hand or thigh twice is what\u2019s she\u2019s done. I still didn\u2019t approve of it because I don\u2019t even touch him but it\u2019s not drastic abuse either. \n\nShe\u2019s also never yelled at me about his actions infront of him. She\u2019s also never yelled at him.

Also, do you use corporal punishment with your 2yo? I\u2019ll preface this by saying I\u2019m making no judgment about corporal punishment, but I do think it\u2019s inappropriate for a 2 yo. So when your grandmother tries to spank your child in your presence what do you do? \nThis is all so ridiculous! She\u2019s not acting like a grandmother or great grandmother to your child!

Why would you let your mother psychologically abuse your little kid? (and let your brother mistreat him, too). What kind of sick game  is she playing, anyway: mistreating him and then wanting him to stay a week??

Your brother is not the winner here either, as he is being raised to be a spoiled brat.", "NTA, your grandma has shown who she is. Believe her. Don't subject your son to her bullshit just cause she is his great grandmother and preserving the peace and saving feelings. Kids will always remember how an adult made them feel they will however try and do what they think they can to make that adult like them like the other kid is liked with disappointing results. Don't put your baby in that position. Be the mean person in this situation. If your grandma, dad and uncle don't like it maybe they should do better.", "NTA.

We're heading toward child abuse territory here, with a golden child and a scapegoat child.  You cannot trust her with your child.\n\nYou were very wise not to let her watch your son for a week.  I don't think you should let her be alone with him for 5 minutes, and I think you'd be smart not to let him be around her.  It doesn't matter what she says to you, what ugly names she calls you, or what your family says.  They don't get a vote on how you parent your child.  What matters is the welfare of your boy, and you are very right to protect him.\n\nYou are not being mean; you are protecting your son from a woman who is cruel and abusive to a little two year old boy.

She is not obligated to give equal gifts, or any gifts. But she seems to dislike your son. Protect him.", "You are absolutely NTA. You need to do what's right for your son.\n\nMy in-laws had a very similar situation when my husband was little. He and his brother are two years apart, and my FIL's mom would take both to the store and get something extravagant for my husband and nothing for his younger brother. One day over dinner, my FIL's mom said something to the effect of, \"Every family has someone you can't stand in it\", clearly referring to my husband's little brother. My in-laws left dinner then and there and cut my GMIL out of their lives for good. It's over 25 years later and they still have zero relationship.\n\nYour grandmother has crossed the line countless times. Enough is enough. Protect your son.", "NTA. I can\u2019t even fathom.  Why on earth are your family members calling you mean? Do they enjoy watching children suffer? That\u2019s\u2026sick.", "Yeah woman. You\u2019re excused.", "NTA. It's very normal to not send Kids to stay with Family who don't like them, that's called responsible parenting. It's not very relevant whether or not Grandma CLAIMS to like your son, if she treats him like she doesn't like him, then you should not send him there If you can avoid it.", "NTA.  Ungrateful for what?  She treats your kid like he's a burden. And your brother like the sun shines out of his ass.  Why subject your kid to this obvious favoritism?  It's not like he's not going to notice the discrepancy how he's treated vs your brother.  Good for you.", "I would never allow a sleepover with anyone until my kid can verbally communicate.

He doesn\u2019t deserve to be around people who don\u2019t cherish him.", "He enjoys it now because he's 2, and doesn't really get that she's being mean on purpose. But soon enough he will. You think that toddlers don't notice things but when he's 3 or 4, he'll notice real quick that she hates him and sees him as an inconvenience. \n\nShe's upset that he cat stay not because she wanted to bond with him. But for the lost chance for her to teach your brother to bully your kid. \n\nBecause he is unwanted in her life and she would rather just not bother at all. So she's mean to him because it's easier then having to pretend she actually cares. \n\nYour kid shouldn't even be there at all. They're harming and abusing him when your gone. \n\nA few hours isn't ok, especially not when you've seen how she acts with you there. \n\nHow are you'll they hurting the kid when your gone", "NTA for not letting him stay, but tbh I wouldn't even bother visiting.  When I was growing up, I had 2 friends who were sisters.  Both were equally awesome, but their grandmother favored one over the other.  Blatantly.  It was cruel and I always felt that it would have been better to not have either girl be associated with this.  It hurt both of them because the favored one knew what was being withheld from her sister and she felt guilt and pain.  \n\nIf grandma can't be fair, grandma doesn't need visits.", "Do not leave her alone with you child.  Ever.  \n\nDo not expose your child to such cruelty.  He deserves better.  \n\nAnyone who wants to spank my child is never ging to spend a moment alone with anymore.  At least not until he's six foot\n\nNTA but protect your child", "NTA you've seen how she is, let her prove herself in smaller sampling-xmas is coming up, see what she does then otherwise odds are your son will be miserable and if she tries to apply  corporal punishment-she  might well abuse him.", "NTA and you should not let her be around your son without supervision. She tries to hit him!", "Are you raising your brother? If you are then tbh I wouldn't allow him to stay with her either, she's going to turn him into a rude, selfish child. It's not healthy for either boy, definitely not for your son, but not for the golden child either.", "NTA.  No bday gifts, no Christmas gifts?  Your son is too young to know what's fair and what's not, be I'm sure he's already is getting the vibe that Grandma doesn't like him very much.  She's had bonding opportunities, but hasn't used that time wisely.  No, you're not being mean, you're protecting your son.  You have no idea what granny will do if your son wets the bed or something since she's quick to \"correct\" him.  She's raising your brother to be an intolerable brat and you wouldn't be wrong to tell her that.  You also wouldn't be wrong to tell her you see how extremely different she treats the boys.  Definitely limit unsupervised time with Grandma.", "You are NTA for saying no to this request. But if you keep allowing your child around this monster of a person you quickly will be.\nI can't fathom how you can justify allowing this abuse towards your child to continue. She shouldn't be anywhere near your kid. Cut her off. No visits. No relationship. She sounds vile.", "If she'll hit him and cuss him out when you are there, what do you think/how bad will it get if you aren't. NTA, and I'd keep him the hell away from anyone who thinks otherwise.", "NTA. You\u2019re not \u201cmean\u201d for not allowing your child to be in someone else\u2019s care for a whole week especially at his age. Nobody is owed access to caring for your child other than their legal guardians. She could treat him like he shoots rainbows out his ass complete with a pot of gold at the end and you could still say no while not being the AH. You are his mother, you decide where he stays and for how long, you do not have to justify wanting your child to stay home.", "NTA.  By her actions she has shown she is unsuitable to look after your son.", "Grandma might be trying to make up for not raising your dad, but maybe it was a good thing she didn\u2019t raise him\u2026. Why is your dad allowing his mother to behave this way?", "Tbh I think Y T A for allowing your son to be around this. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m downvoted. Your grandmother is never going to change. You shouldn\u2019t subject your kid to this.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t be allowing any unsupervised time with someone who blatantly favours another child.", "It's not her mother, it's her grandmother.", "NTA! I\u2019m a grandma to a wonderful 8yo girl and my youngest son is 11yo - the same age difference you\u2019re describing.  I simply CANNOT imagine treating my granddaughter the way you\u2019re describing. When the kids are together, and it happens often, they\u2019re treated equally. Your mom is not a kind person. You are absolutely right to protect your son from her. I\u2019m so sorry this has happened.", "NTA\n\nI would remove that person from my son's life. She's emotionally abusing him whether she (or you) realize it or not. Your son is suffering because of her. \n\nThe risk to his sense of safety and sense of self worth are not worth whatever \"benefits\" he might be getting from her (I fail to see you give any).", "NTA \n\nKeep your son as far from this witch as you can out she'll scar him emotionally. Tell your family exactly why and then end the conversation.", "Trust me your son knows. I was often babysat with my cousins by their grandmother who was no relation to me. And it was horrible. They could do no wrong. I remember one time I changed the radio station on a radio she had in her kitchen and she yelled at me and berated me as I cried.\n\nI even had the same experience at toy stores where she would buy them things and never buy me anything though she never had to but as a child you don't understand. You just feel unwanted.\n\n Stick to your boundaries. Protect your son.", "Nta. Yeah I have an aunt who blatantly favors our two cousins over myself, my brother, and my sister. Even when I try to make an effort with her, she is so much nicer to them and way more loving. I remember one time at the beach last year she got mad at me when we were playing a game cause I was getting competitive and yelled at me to stop in front of everyone. I didn\u2019t say anything but got quiet. \n\nThe next night she plays a game with my two cousins and they\u2019re getting loud and fighting about the rules and she starts trying to get them to compromise and doesn\u2019t take a side and is super nice to them. \n\nOne Christmas she gave our cousins 100 bucks each, and didn\u2019t give my sister anything who\u2019s only a year older than our cousins. She didn\u2019t even visit. \n\nMy point in saying all this, is that it absolutely will make your son feel awful about himself and destroy his self esteem. You should go no contact with your grandma until she stops behaving this way. My aunt isn\u2019t coming to thanksgiving this year and I couldn\u2019t be happier haha. Your son will eventually prefer not to have her around if this continues", "SAVE your son!", "She'd never see my child again."]}
