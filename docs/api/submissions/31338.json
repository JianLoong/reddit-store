She gets him any and everything which was never a problem prior to me having my own children. It\u2019s now became an issue to not only me but to other people in the family because of the clear difference in how she treats my son vs my brother. She\u2019s never bought my son any gifts and has bought him clothing maybe twice. Never a bday gift or Christmas gift. She\u2019s taken my son with her to the store with her multiple times with my brother and every single time has returned with toys for my brother and none for my son. My brother is also stingy with toys, which they\u2019re his so hey it is what it is but it\u2019s disappointing seeing the look on my sons face and hearing him cry over it. I gave her money once to get him something too and she returned with a toy for them to \u201cshare\u201d knowing how my brother is. My brother can crush chips into the carpet, jump on the couch, write on the wall and she wouldn\u2019t blink twice. Just be like \u201cwell that\u2019s just _____(brothers name)\u201d but the one time my son dropped some Candy she cussed me completely out over it potentially staining in her carpet. She also tries to spank my son when he does things like that but won\u2019t with my brother. I\u2019m not jealous over my brother but I\u2019m disappointed in how she treats my son in comparison to my brother. Anyways, she asked to keep my son for a week with my brother and I blatantly told her \u201cno.\u201d And had to repeat myself a few times as she tried to convince me. Eventually she gave up and said I was ungrateful & an asshole for not giving her the chance to bond but I feel she\u2019s had plenty of chances already. I just hung up but since then my dad, uncle & gmas bf have also said I was being mean.

You should keep this boundary.  You aren't the asshole for trying to protect your son, but you would be if you let her continue to berate him and cuss him out.  He's 2, he doesn't deserve that.", "NTA. He\u2019s 2 and being treated unfairly. This has got to hurt his feelings. A few hours at a time\u2026 well that\u2019s ok. You\u2019re coming to get him soon, he\u2019s playing with his uncle. It\u2019s all good. But for a week?!?!?! No way would I let my child go stay with  someone for a week who clearly did not treat him well.", "NTA\n\nand seriously, please NEVER let her have any unsupervised time with your Son again.\n\nWhile she blatantly treats your brother more favourably, I am more concerned that she has spanked your Son. That is abuse, it is never ok to hit a child especially one so young", "NTA. Past behavior is the best indicator of future behavior. Maybe she does want to bond with your son a bit, but she'd have to show real signs of that before she can reasonably be trusted to do so.", "NTA. Good on you for not allowing the person who mistreats your child to have him alone for a week", "NTA. The fact that she put her hands on your kid is enough to nope the hell out.", "I reacted mostly to this \"She also tries to spank my son\"--a lot of people think spanking is fine but it's really detrimental to a child's development, especially when they are 2 and don't understand why an accident would cause an adult to get physically violent, which is what spanking is.

It is sad that your mother is so arrogantly determined to ignore her grandson (and you are quite right not to let her take charge of him), but she is also ruining her son with too much stuff and too little teaching.  Your kid has a far better chance of growing up to be a decent person than your brother - who has already learned to be mean.\n\nI hope your in-laws are nicer people than your own family.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your son is only 2 and being basically told by his nana that he\u2019s less than compared to his uncle who\u2019s only 5\u2026 that\u2019s some twisted evil there. It\u2019s almost like they need your son to be miserable for them to be happy\u2026 \n\nI have a 3yr old. If ANYONE (and I mean anyone) ever dared to try and spank my son, not only would that person get the beating of a lifetime by me but they\u2019d NEVER be allowed near my child again! \n\nI would keep your beautiful child away from the wicked grandmother.

He\u2019ll come crying to me. She does things like kick him out of her room but allow my brother to stay and acts as if doing things for him like getting a sippy cup or making him food is too much work. She\u2019ll give him junk food all day long instead of feeding him properly because he can\u2019t speak up to say what he wants. It\u2019s just too much for me.", "Agreed!!! Also, do you use corporal punishment with your 2yo? I\u2019ll preface this by saying I\u2019m making no judgment about corporal punishment, but I do think it\u2019s inappropriate for a 2 yo. So when your grandmother tries to spank your child in your presence what do you do? \nThis is all so ridiculous! She\u2019s not acting like a grandmother or great grandmother to your child! I think it could be emotionally detrimental for your son to be around her and as his mother you should protect him from her!! So no you\u2019re NTA she is!", "That\u2019s usually what happens. I\u2019ll let him stay for a few hours and for most of the time I\u2019m there as she\u2019s always calling me within an hour or two asking when I\u2019m coming to get him otherwise. He enjoys his time with him.", "Which is what I look for. Until then, she won\u2019t be keeping him.", "All you described is abuse , verbal but abuse \n\n\nAlso spanking him is physical abuse so please don't let her unsupervised with your son . Please keep her as far away from him as possible. Go low contact and protect your child.\n NTA"]}
