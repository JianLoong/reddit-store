She gets him any and everything which was never a problem prior to me having my own children. It\u2019s now became an issue to not only me but to other people in the family because of the clear difference in how she treats my son vs my brother. She\u2019s never bought my son any gifts and has bought him clothing maybe twice. Never a bday gift or Christmas gift. She\u2019s taken my son with her to the store with her multiple times with my brother and every single time has returned with toys for my brother and none for my son. My brother is also stingy with toys, which they\u2019re his so hey it is what it is but it\u2019s disappointing seeing the look on my sons face and hearing him cry over it. I gave her money once to get him something too and she returned with a toy for them to \u201cshare\u201d knowing how my brother is. My brother can crush chips into the carpet, jump on the couch, write on the wall and she wouldn\u2019t blink twice. Just be like \u201cwell that\u2019s just _____(brothers name)\u201d but the one time my son dropped some Candy she cussed me completely out over it potentially staining in her carpet. She also tries to spank my son when he does things like that but won\u2019t with my brother. I\u2019m not jealous over my brother but I\u2019m disappointed in how she treats my son in comparison to my brother. Anyways, she asked to keep my son for a week with my brother and I blatantly told her \u201cno.\u201d And had to repeat myself a few times as she tried to convince me. Eventually she gave up and said I was ungrateful & an asshole for not giving her the chance to bond but I feel she\u2019s had plenty of chances already. I just hung up but since then my dad, uncle & gmas bf have also said I was being mean.

You\u2019re coming to get him soon, he\u2019s playing with his uncle. It\u2019s all good. But for a week?!?!?!

That is abuse, it is never ok to hit a child especially one so young", "NTA. Past behavior is the best indicator of future behavior.

Good on you for not allowing the person who mistreats your child to have him alone for a week", "NTA. The fact that she put her hands on your kid is enough to nope the hell out.", "I reacted mostly to this \"She also tries to spank my son\"--a lot of people think spanking is fine but it's really detrimental to a child's development, especially when they are 2 and don't understand why an accident would cause an adult to get physically violent, which is what spanking is.

It is sad that your mother is so arrogantly determined to ignore her grandson (and you are quite right not to let her take charge of him), but she is also ruining her son with too much stuff and too little teaching.  Your kid has a far better chance of growing up to be a decent person than your brother - who has already learned to be mean.\n\nI hope your in-laws are nicer people than your own family.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

He\u2019ll come crying to me. She does things like kick him out of her room but allow my brother to stay and acts as if doing things for him like getting a sippy cup or making him food is too much work. She\u2019ll give him junk food all day long instead of feeding him properly because he can\u2019t speak up to say what he wants. It\u2019s just too much for me.", "Agreed!!! Also, do you use corporal punishment with your 2yo? I\u2019ll preface this by saying I\u2019m making no judgment about corporal punishment, but I do think it\u2019s inappropriate for a 2 yo. So when your grandmother tries to spank your child in your presence what do you do? \nThis is all so ridiculous! She\u2019s not acting like a grandmother or great grandmother to your child! I think it could be emotionally detrimental for your son to be around her and as his mother you should protect him from her!! So no you\u2019re NTA she is!", "That\u2019s usually what happens. I\u2019ll let him stay for a few hours and for most of the time I\u2019m there as she\u2019s always calling me within an hour or two asking when I\u2019m coming to get him otherwise. He enjoys his time with him.", "Which is what I look for. Until then, she won\u2019t be keeping him.", "All you described is abuse , verbal but abuse \n\n\nAlso spanking him is physical abuse so please don't let her unsupervised with your son . Please keep her as far away from him as possible. Go low contact and protect your child.\n NTA", "NTA. Protect your son from the mean, judgmental grandmonster.", "NTA  i would go NC or LC with grandma and her flying monkeys", "NTA\n\nHer behaviour has gone over from favouritism into mistreatment. \n\nShe shouts at and spanks your child and gets one child toys and not the other even when given money. She would not be having any relationship at all with my child if she behaved like this, let alone have him for a week.", "She's going to mess up OP's brother so much with her behaviour.\nNTA protect your kid, your grandmother is not a safe person for him to be around.", "NTA. Why would you let your mother psychologically abuse your little kid? (and let your brother mistreat him, too). What kind of sick game  is she playing, anyway: mistreating him and then wanting him to stay a week?? So she can abuse him even more???", "NTA but really why do you keep exposing your son to this woman? Why do you keep letting her hurt him?", "NTA \n\nAnd this isn\u2019t just favoritism. This is pointed unkindness towards your child", "I think you need to start limiting contact with everyone who thinks this is ok. Protect your kid. NTA. Just tell them it\u2019s none of their business and start blocking people. Your grandmother is evil. Who hits a toddler?", " No, you\u2019re being a good mother", "NTA  He's your son and you get to decide what is done. And NO is a complete sentence. Just gray wall the others and live your best life!", "NTA. If your family can't see the ways she treats her grandson that is on them. You have to raise your son in a healthy way, and that is not letting him be treated as less than by your family. Your brother is not the winner here either, as he is being raised to be a spoiled brat.", "NTA, your grandma has shown who she is. Believe her. Don't subject your son to her bullshit just cause she is his great grandmother and preserving the peace and saving feelings. Kids will always remember how an adult made them feel they will however try and do what they think they can to make that adult like them like the other kid is liked with disappointing results. Don't put your baby in that position. Be the mean person in this situation. If your grandma, dad and uncle don't like it maybe they should do better.", "NTA. You son regularly comes home crying from being with her for only a few hours. She can't manage them both fairly for even a day. She can work on that before asking for a whole week.", "you're \"disappointed\" that your mother physically and mentally abuses your son?\n\nGET THE KID AWAY FROM THE ABUSER. wtf?\n\nNTA for this, but ywbta if you allowed this to go on.", "Nta", "I'm very much hoping you don't live with your grandmother because, as a good mother, you need to keep your son away from her.  \n\nThe fact that she clearly favors another child is bad enough, but when you got to the part where she's spanking a  2 year old for dropping something:  big no!!!  We're heading toward child abuse territory here, with a golden child and a scapegoat child.  You cannot trust her with your child.\n\nYou were very wise not to let her watch your son for a week.  I don't think you should let her be alone with him for 5 minutes, and I think you'd be smart not to let him be around her.  It doesn't matter what she says to you, what ugly names she calls you, or what your family says.  They don't get a vote on how you parent your child.  What matters is the welfare of your boy, and you are very right to protect him.\n\nYou are not being mean; you are protecting your son from a woman who is cruel and abusive to a little two year old boy.  If your family wants you to subject your son to that because grandma wants it, then they're A's caught up in a toxic family dynamic.  \n\nBut as for you, you're a good mom and NTA!", "You are obviously NTA for not agreeing to let your 2yo spend a week in someone else's care just because she wants it. But given how she treats him, you should never allow her to spend any time with him, absolutely not unsupervised.\n\nGift disparity etc should play no role here. She is not obligated to give equal gifts, or any gifts. But she seems to dislike your son. Protect him.", "You are absolutely NTA. You need to do what's right for your son.\n\nMy in-laws had a very similar situation when my husband was little. He and his brother are two years apart, and my FIL's mom would take both to the store and get something extravagant for my husband and nothing for his younger brother. One day over dinner, my FIL's mom said something to the effect of, \"Every family has someone you can't stand in it\", clearly referring to my husband's little brother. My in-laws left dinner then and there and cut my GMIL out of their lives for good. It's over 25 years later and they still have zero relationship.\n\nYour grandmother has crossed the line countless times. Enough is enough. Protect your son.", "NTA. I can\u2019t even fathom.  Why on earth are your family members calling you mean? Do they enjoy watching children suffer? That\u2019s\u2026sick.", "Yeah woman. You\u2019re excused.", "NTA. It's very normal to not send Kids to stay with Family who don't like them, that's called responsible parenting. It's not very relevant whether or not Grandma CLAIMS to like your son, if she treats him like she doesn't like him, then you should not send him there If you can avoid it.", "NTA.  Ungrateful for what?  She treats your kid like he's a burden. And your brother like the sun shines out of his ass.  Why subject your kid to this obvious favoritism?  It's not like he's not going to notice the discrepancy how he's treated vs your brother.  Good for you.", "I would never allow a sleepover with anyone until my kid can verbally communicate. Still, I wouldn\u2019t allow my kid around her unsupervised\u2014EVER!", "why do you subject your son to this abuse? you are supposed to PROTECT your kid. do it.", "Why are you leaving him in her care? He doesn\u2019t deserve to be around people who don\u2019t cherish him.", "He enjoys it now because he's 2, and doesn't really get that she's being mean on purpose. But soon enough he will. You think that toddlers don't notice things but when he's 3 or 4, he'll notice real quick that she hates him and sees him as an inconvenience. \n\nShe's upset that he cat stay not because she wanted to bond with him. But for the lost chance for her to teach your brother to bully your kid. \n\nBecause he is unwanted in her life and she would rather just not bother at all. So she's mean to him because it's easier then having to pretend she actually cares. \n\nYour kid shouldn't even be there at all. They're harming and abusing him when your gone. \n\nA few hours isn't ok, especially not when you've seen how she acts with you there. \n\nHow are you'll they hurting the kid when your gone"]}
