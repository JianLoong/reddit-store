We had a lot in common including one major area that is important to both of us and also makes it hard to date because not many other people are this way. \n\nI was excited because he was very attractive, had a good job, seemed fun and exciting etc. \n\nHe immediately started texting ALOT. Like 20+ times a day. Double and triple texting if I didn\u2019t respond within 30min. To me, this is a little intense and overwhelming. But, since we clicked on all the other important things I decided to let it go. \n\nWe had a pretty good first date actually. Good conversation, dinner drinks etc. He asked to kiss me good night and I said yes. The kids was fine, but no sparks. \n\nBut still, I left the date hopeful. I finally met a nice guy who matched in so many important levels. \n\nThen the texting got more intense. All day everyday. We had planned a date for the end of the week. He was supposed to pick me up, but something made me decide to just meet him there last minute.\n\nWhen I met him that night, I had kind of lost my excitement. His constant texting throughout the week (and the things he said) had really started to put me off. But again we connected on that really huge thing that not many people are, so I wanted to give it a shot. \n\nThe date started fine, but I could tell he was a little annoyed that I didn\u2019t let him pick me up. \n\nWe started with drinks (he paid), then went to another place for apps (he paid), then a third place for a quick dinner (I paid but it was significantly less than previous two bills). \n\nIt was around second location that I really started to get a bad taste in my mouth. He kept hinting that he wanted to come over. I finally said I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that since this was only our second date. After that he kept saying how much he was looking forward to meeting my dog, and was Visibly disappointed. \nHe was also constantly in my space and touching me that I also didn\u2019t like.\n\nI felt bad because he had drove over an hour to meet me, and had paid for everything (thus far) so I suggested we get a quick dinner, but I knew I wasn\u2019t feeling it anymore at this point. \n\nThe date ended when I said I wasn\u2019t feeling good so he walked me to my car. I then offered to give him a ride to his car. When we got there, he asked to kiss me. I said sure. We kissed, very short. Then he asked again, I obliged because I just felt really uncomfortable and wanted it to be over. But then he dodged my kiss and when I said hey what\u2019s going on, he laughed and said,\nOh I\u2019m just fucking with you. I freaked out and said I don\u2019t like being fucked with and to get out of my car. He tried to apologize, but I was seeing red and told him again to just get out. \n\nSo AITA for how I let the night go on when I was uncomfortable, for letting him pay, or for yelling at him? Idk, this happened a week ago and I still feel weird about it. He unfollowed and blocked me on everything.\n\nINFO- I yelled at him to get out, not because he kissed me, but because he laughed at me and said he was fucking with me. Which made me feel like he knew I wasn\u2019t into it, and was just being pushy (as he had been all night) to make me uncomfortable.", "created_utc": 1667572154, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym0iyx/aita_for_yelling_at_my_date/", "score": 0, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Better to find out early on!", "As always whe have just one side of what happend but you\u00b4re clearly TA even in your version.You weren\u00b4t feeling it anymore and wanted for it to be over, so you should have communicated that instead of kissing him. What did you expect? That he magically knows?", "NTA. You gave it a try even though you had misgivings due to the crazed amount of texting, it didn't work out. Don't over think it, break it off and move on. You did the right thing by driving there on your own and not inviting him back home. \n\nToo much pressure, red flag.
