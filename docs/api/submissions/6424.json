She liked them and her mother asked me to do some for her daughter. I originally said sure and told her to bring me the jeans and materials and I could do them for her. I wasn't going to charge her at all. However she didn't bring me anything and then called angry that I hadn't made them. She expected me to buy the pants and materials and do them for her. So I told her I couldn't do that and apologized. \n\nNow she is angry and my sister is angry as well because I refused. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm being an A hole because the little girl wanting them clearly thinks they are cool and I feel awful that I'm letting her down especially because I agreed at first.
