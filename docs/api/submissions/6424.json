He jokingly refers to my legs as short little stubs because I have to take like 2 steps for every one of his.\n\nWe debate a lot if a kid of ours would end up with his deer legs or my stubs or would they be so fortunate as to get an average of our legs.\n\nPoor dumb thing didn\u2019t realise he was really wearing too short of an inseam until he met me lol.", "Nope, nope, not a misunderstanding. Either your sister's friend is one of the most entitled choosy beggars, or there's another conflict and play and it's \"pick a fight\" time.\n\nIf the kids go to school together, there could be something there. I'd suggest having a gentle chat with your kiddo about bullying. At a different time, have a chat about sister's friend's kiddo, see if there's been any dust-ups.\n\nIt's probably nothing, but if mommy acts that way, I can't help but wonder how their kiddo acts.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't charge for the labor. The least she can do is bring the material. \n\nAlso I was a really tall growing up. Mom 5'11 sperm donor like 6'7 and I had growth spurts I swear almost monthly.  My family would intentionally buy me pants to long and hem them up \ud83d\ude02 Your way is alot cuter.", "The nerve of some people.  You clearly let her know you'll do it provided she brings the materials, which she didn't.  I don't get how your sister is upset by this.  Why not ask your sister to buy the material for her friend and you'll do it?  I bet she declines\n\nClearly NTA", "Nta", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't respect your time, your talent, or your budget. She expects you to do her a favor, unpaid, and for you to spend money on it.\n\nIt's time to remind them, \"I said I would do it if you brought me pants and materials; you have done neither. I don't appreciate being yelled at when you didn't hold up your end.\"", "Nta youre not the kids mother and do not have any responsibility of buying clothes for her ESPECIALLY as you were willing to do the work for free", "NTA\n\nIf she wants it done she can provide the materials and now pay you no less than $25 to do it.", "NTA, but it bothers me that you are actually not already sure of this.\n\nHow can you wonder if you are an ahole for not buying some 3rd hand connection clothes and additional materials and spending your time making what they DEMAND of you? Sure, the kid might really like what your girls wear (clever solutions BTW!); that doesn't mean you owe it to buy and make everything for her. I bet lots of girls would like them. Do you owe every girl buying and making them what they'd like, just because... well, those girls want them and think they are cool?\n\nOK, so you agreed to initially. It's the girls' mom who is letting her down. All she had to do was get the jeans. She's not willing to do that; she's the one disappointing her daughter. You can, with clear conscience, tell this woman that, thanks to her gall, the offer is no longer on the table... or (if you still want to give the girl something) you can tell this woman that she can bring you one pair of jeans by X date that you will fix up and that is the end of your offer - again because of her unmitigated gall to expect and actually demand that you buy the jeans for the girl.", "NTA. That's pretty high expectations for a generous, free favor. They're both being ridiculous.", "NTA...the mother and your sister are being unreasonable. You are offering free labor and it's not appreciated. Next.", "I highly recommend following this account on Instagram: [Can you sew this for me](http://www.instagram.com/canyousewthisforme), which shows you how entitled people feel when it comes to demanding other people's skills and time. NTA, she clearly doesn't understand the time and money it costs to do this. The entitlement to expect this for free (and for you to buy everything!) is unreal!", "NTA. You were doing her a favour and she didn\u2019t hold up her end of the deal. It\u2019s her own fault.\n\nWhy is your sister angry though? Did you tell her that her friend didn\u2019t bring you the supplies?", "NTA\n\n\nTell your sister to buy the materials. Why TF would you buy clothes for a child cause they like your child\u2019s clothes. What\u2019s next the mom likes your ring? Buy her one too. \n\n\nMaybe explain to your sister the facts. Her friend could be manipulating the truth. If not tell them both to bugger off. Oh the entitlement.", "NTA. Have they agreed to *pay you for your work*? On top of providing the materials of course. If not, they can fuck all the way off, labor ain't free. Even if they *did* offer to pay you, you're still allowed to refuse for *any reason*. \n\nBut since it sounds like they haven't offered you anything, not even gratitude, you're even more not the asshole.", "NTA.\n\nBoth the mom and little girl need to learn the word no.", "NTA- your offer to make them if she bought materials was extremely generous. She didn't hold up her part of the deal so nothing was made. Don't waste your time on her.", "NTA - you outlined your expectations, that you would provide the service (generously free of charge) and she was supposed to bring you the materials. The audacity of expecting you to do it all for free and provide the clothes and then be angry that you didn\u2019t!  Your sister and her friend are both AH.  If you feel like being kind, tell your sister that she can buy the jeans and materials.", "Bravo, well said!", "My 10-year-old niece is built like that , too.  I feel you with the whole pants issue.  Shopping is not fun because nothing she likes fits properly.", "Did you read the post at all? Like at all?", "Have you thought about making a few pairs and opening up an Etsy shop? These sound super cute and maybe it could be a great side hustle! Then if people ask, you can send them to your shop and keep it formal.", "I'm losing my mind. You literally offered to do what she wanted, you just won't buy her kid a new wardrobe. You're NTA.", "NTA. You gave an inch, they tried to take a mile. Sounds like a choosing beggar situation.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry your sister is mad because you won\u2019t cloth her friends children? Why isn\u2019t your sister buying the pants then? Why are these people all entitled to your time, skill AND money? That\u2019s absolutely absurd. The fact that they\u2019ve responded with anger over this would push me over the edge. Screw them and their nasty entitlement, how dare they get angry with you?? Man people are messed up these days.", "NTA, the other mom is being selfish. But, if I may be so bold... how about holding little sewing classes for your daughters and their friends to teach them how to decorate their own clothing?  I was learning to sew at their age, and it was a very liberating experience. It set me up for a lifetime of artistic expression, and it made me feel very empowered at the time.  Plus, could be fun for all the kids. :D", "Nta. You have her direction, she didn't follow through. Block her out of your life as best as possible.", "NTA  People who don't craft often don't have a real appreciation for the time and money that can go into a project.  \n\nWhen my son was in high school, I collected all his photos and certificates (etc) and on graduation day gave him a very fat scrapbook that cost about $300 to make (in 2008).  I worked on it for 3 years. His friend saw it like it, and my son said \"my mom will make you one!\"  Friend's mom called, said she had a box of stuff for her son that I could go through to make his scrapbook, and not to worry about time, that if I had it done by the end of the month, she'd be happy.  AHEM.....  I replied that as soon as she got the bits into order, I would go with her to the scrapbook store, help her make purchases, and give her tips on how to put the book together.  I never heard from her again :)\n\nSo, do not feel bad, you did not break a promise.  You offered to embroider what she brought you, with supplies she provided.  You did not offer to do all the shopping as well!\n\nAnd, thank you for bringing the bell bottom back!", "NTA\n\nAnd....hang on to those embroidered pants after your girls outgrow them.\n\nThey may become cherished heirlooms --- and inspire your kids to learn sewing and embroidery.\n\n*Boys can learn too. Sailors soldiers and big bad pirates were experts at sewing and embroidering utility bags and their clothes :)", "Absolutely no way you could be considered the arsehole here. NTA", "NTA - I was reading waiting for you to say that you didn't feel like doing this at all, but I didn't even consider them not providing at least the pants for this request. At the very least ask if you are willing to buy and then obviously refund you if she doesn't know what pants to buy.", "NTA \n\nWtf? They just expect free clothes?? \n\nThat\u2019s not how the world works lolll \n\nTell them you initially would have done it with their materials, but now if they\u2019d like to commission a hand embroidered child\u2019s pants, it\u2019s $X00 \n\nOi", "NTA. What an entitled mother to expect you to buy and pay for everything. Tell your sister if she\u2019s so upset she can buy all the supplies.", "NTA. Entitled much?!?!?", "JFC, the entitlement. NTA.\n\nBtw, there's a lovely Instagram channel called \"canyousewthisforme\". I am sure you'll enjoy it.", "NTA. I want its free labor for the cost of materials. Sister's friend some kind of entitled. Don't waste time worrying about it. Nothing done wrong", "It was already super generous to volunteer your time for free.  The fact that she also wanted you to provide all materials is selfish.  Tell your sister she can supply the entitled mom if she cares that much.  NTA", "NTA you are willing to do them but if  you cant afford it on your dime you are not obligated to do anything.  oh well so sad", "At first im like ok misunderstanding, but she called and got mad?! And expected you to buy the stuff you told her to provide to you? Hell no! NTA", "NTA \n\nWhy are you supposed to spend your own money on that girl's wardrobe? She is a stranger to you.", "NTA. You made a very generous offer to donate your time and talent. They didn't accept, they just demanded more. That's rude, entitled, and AH behavior on their part.", "NTA in the least\u2014and I love your solution to your girls growing out of their jeans!", "NTA. Your stipulations are perfectly reasonable.", "NTA but don't work for free.  You give an inch and people will expect a mile.  If someone wants embroidery, charge a fee for your time, and a fee plus materials if they don't want to provide them.\n\nAlso, maybe ask your kids if they are ok with you making those for someone else too?  They might feel special having something unique their mom made.", "She didn't bring you any of the stuff you asked for.. Why would you do it? NTA.", "NTA. /r/choosingbeggars", "So many people who don't craft are aholes. This is above and beyond the usual non-crafter assholery in they expected you buy all of this out of pocket? I mean you were nice to even say you would do it for nothing, but that?! No. You don't owe anyone that but your own kids.", "My daughter is like that. Every one of her pants has adjustable waist or darts. I feel for her.", "NTA\n\nIf she brings you the pants, tell her there's now at least a $40 AH tax to do it.", "Absolutely. Classical entitled & choosy beggars with your sister enabling this ridiculous bullshit.\n\nDon't worry, you're not the first target of their entitlement nor will you be the last. Maybe just ignore their tantrum.\n\nNTA, obviously.", "I don\u2019t think a kid as those much high hopes on clothes, given the age.\n\nThe mother did break those hope anyway, che could have just bought the materials", "Nta.She knew from that start what you expected her to bring."]}
