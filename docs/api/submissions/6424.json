You said to bring the materials and she didn't.  How could you do it without the materials?  What, are you psychic and automatically know which size she is, or the length of pants she'll need?  Or does she just think every little girl is the same size?  And not only all that, she wanted it for free? WTF?", "I am stunned that you could even consider that you could be in the wrong. \n\nNTA", "NTA and unfortunately one mistake that OP made in this situation is to be too polite and APOLOGISE. \n\nThere is nothing to apologise for and by doing that the friend and the sister feel even more entitled and in the right. \n\nThe very least this lady could have done would be to say that she would put up the money to OP for the material if she doesn\u2019t know where to source it. It\u2019s nice enough of OP to provide free labor.\n\nJust some feedback to OP for the next time (if there is one) - you need to reframe this deal in terms that they understand and where you stand your ground affirming your own worth. \n\nFor example: I\u2019m happy to help and make this embroidery for your daughter and will even do you a favor and do the work for free. All I ask is that you purchase the materials needed or give me money upfront so that I can buy it. I\u2019m very busy but happy to help you out on this one, let me know once you\u2019ve transferred the funds. You\u2019re welcome.", "Omg - that woman is a beesh. I wouldn\u2019t ever think it was okay to treat someone like this. You need to tell you sister that you don\u2019t like the company she keeps."]}
