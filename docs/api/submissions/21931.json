I wasn\u2019t a smoker but started to smoke *in excess* to deal with my grief and PTSD. At my worst, I smoked literally non-stop \ud83d\ude2c My Mom, very smartly, bought all my cigarettes and never pressured me to quit, but in exchange, she required me to attend therapy and group therapy. Those cigarettes were an important (and yes terrible) crutch for me, but once I was able to process my emotions, I stopped smoking completely because I then associated them with a terrible time in my life. I say play the long game. I think focusing on the cigarettes is missing the elephant in the room that is so hard to talk about: Your child has lost a child, an unthinkable event, you have lost a grandchild, a horrific outcome, but your son is here still, and will get to the next phase of his life with your help. If you haven\u2019t sought therapy, it can also help you, and help you deal with your son. Best of luck to all your family through this difficult journey\u2665\ufe0f\n\nEdit to say: NAH", "NTA, but I think there\u2019s room here to compromise. \n\nYou can\u2019t \u2018force\u2019 anyone to quit smoking, they have to want to do it. So locking up smokes is fruitless really. That said watching a kids smoke his lungs out seems a bit too passives as well \n\nYou can also not enable the habit by not allowing him to smoke anywhere on your property so if he wants to chain smoke, it\u2019s closest at the end of the driveway. This may help with your husband who understandably has a big issue with smoking. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know where he gets the money to chain smoke, but if it\u2019s you then this is another way to stop enabling.", "I'm pretty strongly against smoking. I have seen people on their deathbed from lung cancer. It's horrible. **But--** you cannot force an adult to quit smoking. Things like locking up cigarettes, that only drives the person further away and makes them dig in their heels. And I think you rightly realize that with everything else going on in your son's life, driving him away is the last thing you want to do.\n\nNTA", "You know this isn\u2019t black and white. I\u2019m going to go NAH. There is no way I\u2019m going to blame your son for being distraught or you for trying to make his life easier because I know how hard it is to see a loved one in pain. At the same time your husband is right and he does need help to quit. He needs to realise it himself though and you guys have to help him with therapy and support.", "Info: \n\nWhat is anyone doing to help son mourn and move on besides dictate his bad habits? Are we encouraging therapy, also?", "You are not the ah for not forcing him to quit as at 18 he is an adult. However you are the ah for making it easier for him to smoke by giving him the key to the cabinet and for considering it an acceptable coping mechanism", "You are enabling him. You can\u2019t force someone to quit before they\u2019re ready, which is what your husband is trying to do, but you shouldn\u2019t make it easy for him either. \n\nIs he in therapy? He needs support to deal with his grief and he needs to learn to cope with his feelings in a healthy way.", "NTA. As much as you and your husband may not like it, he's an adult now and can make his own decisions. Smokers will always find a reason why now isn't the time to quit and need to come to that conclusion on their own.", "NTA. There is an in-between here - not taking an adults cigarette's away but also not ignoring it and talking to him about your concerns. You're also right that it might not be the best time for him to try to give up smoking when that's notoriously difficult/stressful, so on balance I'd agree with you.", "How about focusing on trying to get your son to see a therapist for his loss. Yes he needs to quit but as parents you\u2019re  not trying focus on the root of the issue. You\u2019re both.", "Get your kid in therapy. He\u2019s suffering terribly.", "NTA, although I do think you and your husband should've discussed how to handle the smoking rather than going against each other. If your son wants to smoke, he's an adult and unfortunately you can't stop him from doing so. Best that can be done is to encourage him to want to give it up but maybe not at the moment while he's dealing with his loss.", "NTA . Your Son is old enough to make his own lifestyle decisions and rationing cigarettes sounds very controlling.\n\nI'm not a Professional, but it seems clear your Son needs some help with his Mental Health and the excessive smoking could just be a symptom of that.", "Does your son want to quit? If so, then you are the asshole for working against that goal. If not, then all of you are just in a shitty situation.", "Which country are you in?", "Sounds like addressing his mental health and grief may be a positive step toward addressing his nicotine addiction.", "NAH. Getting your son professional grief counseling would do more to minimize his coping mechanism than his dad nagging him.", "NAH but you should encourage him to get therapy. He\u2019s going through a traumatic time right now and needs help", "No AH\u2019s here. You guys are all going through something just awful. I\u2019m so incredibly sorry. I\u2019m sending you love and hopes for healing.", "NAH. \n\nIt\u2019s super hard to get someone to quit smoking unless they really want to. \n\nIt is clear that you and your husband have a differing opinion on this, but I don\u2019t think either of you are assholes, you\u2019re both just trying to do right by your son. \n\nMaybe you can both sit down without Max, try to keep it to just facts and see if you can find a compromise?\n\nIt sounds like your son is really having a hard time at the moment; I  truly hope things become better for you all.", "YTA\n\nIf you tolerate it, you make it somewhat easier for him to cling on to his addiction. However, it\u2019s very hard for smokers to give up the habit if they don\u2019t really want it themselves, and even then it\u2019s hard. I think smoking is a form of self medication and you could support your son in de-stressing his life, that might help.", "NTA. As a former cigarette addict, you can't force your son to quit.  That is something he has to do.  He is an 18 year old, which is legally an adult.  He is going through major trauma at the moment.  The things that your husband is doing will drive a wedge in their relationship.  I agree with all that getting him into therapy is critical for his well being.  You're a good mom for not adding to his distress.", "I don\u2019t want to call you the A because your son is going through hell but kinda you are the A because one smoking kills and two it doesn\u2019t sound like you are doing much to help him move on", "NTA. He's an adult and you can't control him. End of story as far as that goes.\n\nWhat I would do is encourage him to seek counseling or therapy. Our job as parents doesn't end because our babies grow up, it just changes. Where before you made the rules, now you can only make suggestions, offer a helping hand and be his support system.", "No judgement (I guess NAH)..... there's not a way to say this that's not going to sound snarky, but I'm going to preface it that my tone is meant to sound gentle, like how one might speak in a therapy session:\n\nFrom the details in this story, it sounds like you've never set a boundary for your son in his life. \n\nSo why would your husband expect you to start now? He must be exhausted. How often in the last 18 years have you undermined his parenting?\n\nI think some family therapy in addition to grief counseling is needed.", "YTA - things may be hard for him right now, but he's only eighteen and it's easier to stop now than later. It isn't far on him that you're letting him damage his body like this at such a young age - you should introduce other coping methods for him. Letting him carry on will only hurt him and end in more tragedy.", "NTA, I think he\u2019s got bigger problems right now. He\u2019s not gonna be able to quit until he really wants to anyway and I could see why this isn\u2019t the top of his priority list right now.", "NTA\n\nI'm wondering if the cigarettes are filling a psychological need by giving him space (outside and away from people), giving him a sense of control/choice/agency, or through focusing on the breath.", "NTA. But honestly, I would go as far as saying there are NAH. Your son suffered a traumatic loss. Even if she wasn\u2019t planned, the loss of his daughter has clearly hit him hard, and he\u2019s doing the only thing he can think of to numb away the pain. As his mom, you hate seeing him in pain and want him close. So you are leaving him alone, knowing he will stay. Your husband is watching his son go further down a slippery road and is trying to be rational and stop it. You are all doing what you think is best, even if it\u2019s not.\n\nI think he might need therapy. He needs to deal with the loss of his daughter, and gently be reminded that he has 2 choices. 1st is to do something with his life that would make her proud of him. 2nd is to waste away by chain smoking. But it needs to come from someone else. Not mom. Not dad. A neutral party.\n\nAs for you and your husband, you need to be on the same page. If you aren\u2019t, neither of you are helping your son. Just be there for him. Good luck, and I\u2019m sorry about your granddaughter.", "NTA\n\nEchoing everyone who said you can't force him to quit. \n\nI did want to say that since the cigarettes seem to be a form of self medicating, and giving him time to think, and since I know cigarettes are expensive, there is nothing wrong with getting therapy and mental and emotional health support. \n\nThat may be a better long term treatment for the root cause of being understandably upset at losing a child.", "NTA", "NTA ---- Like you said you can't force somebody to quit especially if they don't want to, having said that gentle and firm encouragement wouldn't be wrong and it really sounds like he needs some grief counselling it could hopefully prevent it from going to depression or worse.", "NTA You cant force him to stop. That is futile. He needs to want it. All your husband would achieve is Max hiding his cigarettes better.", "NTA - because you can\u2019t control an 18 yr old. But maybe ask him to start a training program with you to run a 5K or something. Exercise will do him good mentally and physically and once you run 100 yards and feel like you\u2019re going to die, it should slow down the smoking. Stopping is really hard. He will have to really want to for it to happen.", "He is 18 now so I don\u2019t see how you can \u201cforce him to quit\u201d anything. All you could do is not enable him, don\u2019t allow it on your property and don\u2019t provide cigarettes or money for them. But it seems like the time spent worrying about the smoking might be better spent on trying to get him into some type of therapy. By your admission he has always been a troubled child and adding the death of a baby to that seems to have become more than he can handle on his own.", "NTA.  Instead of forcing him to quit, maybe try to get him into grief counseling if he isn\u2019t already.  Sorry to say no one quits anything until they are ready so your husband\u2019s efforts are unlikely to be effective.", "You can't force him to quit. You can make things harder for him to smoke, but if he wants to smoke, he'll find a way.\n\nYou should focus on finding ways to help him quit smoking.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I do think y\u2019all should encourage him to quit. My husband and I quit by using chantix, it\u2019s honestly extremely effective and it only took about a month.

You realize that he should quit, but you also understand that in the current situation smoking helps give him comfort (or at least he thinks it does)\n\nMy advice as a random internet stranger is to have an honest conversation with him on the subject of smoking. (Let him bring up other subjects if he wants, but if he doesn't, just stick with smoking.) Confirm that he wants to quit and wants your help.... or that he's not ready to quit and doesn't want you to help.", "Your son his going to have to find his path.
