A little background information, me and my boyfriend have been together for around 3 years and we both trust each other with our lives. He is one of the higher positions in a big company, which obviously causes frequent burn outs, which is why I agreed to this trip, thinking we deserve a break. A few weeks ago, I got a call from my sister (F 22) saying that she and her boyfriend were planning a trip to France as he had family living there, and they wanted to meet my sister. Her plan was to bring me along as her side of the family.\n\nFast forward a little, we get there and my bf tells me that he has an ex (like a fling) living in France at the moment, whom he decided to stay friends with. He had travelled to France multiple times for his work, met up with her and few other friends, and he mentioned how she was asking him to meet me for a coffee. I agreed and we meet up at a coffee shop. She's a great woman (we'll call her Serafine, F-26) and we instantly clicked, chatting and becoming closer. Few days later, we go to meet my sister's boyfriend's family, and Adrian gets the news. Serafine had gotten into a little accident and was currently in the hospital. My bf, of course is worried, because he actually considers her a good friend and I do too.\n\nWhile I am trying to console him, My sister overhears and immediately pulls me away from my confused boyfriend and proceeds to talk my ear off about how he shouldn't have shown so much concern about another woman infront of me and how he should have been a little bit more considerate about my feelings. I told her I was fine with him being worried, as I was worried for my new friend too. She then decides to step up her game and pulls out stories about how she saw him looking at her when I'm not around and how she thinks he's cheating on me. I obviously don't listen to her but she doesn't stop trying to convince me that he's a douchebag. I just tell her that I'll have a look at it and leave.\n\nNow this would have been fine if my boyfriend didn't come up to me the next day and tell me that my sister tried to hug him from behind and tried to 'console' him, all while I was asleep. I try to confront her about it and she breaks down into tears about how 'it should've been her' and how 'she's better for him' and what not. So long story short, she has had a crush on him ever since we started dating and is only dating her boyfriend to try and act like she doesn't like mine. She even tried to deny everything she said LITERALLY 5 MINUTES AGO when her boyfriend walked in. Now my parents are blowing up my phone about how I didn't have to be so rude about it. They said that all her attempts to break us up was just her 'joking around' and that I should understand where she's coming from and even had the guts to act like it was my bf's fault for caring so much about a 'random woman' and that she was just looking out for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the A\\*\\*hole?", "created_utc": 1701457768, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/188js8v/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sister_for_trying_to_turn/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're seen as the problem for *not just giving Adrian to your sister* because *she's always liked him.*\n\nIgnore them all for now. You know if their attitude towards you is out of the ordinary behavior for them or if it fits in a pattern.  If it's a pattern then you have some work to figure out what to do next.\n\nGood luck.", "I think this is even worse than you posted. Your sister probably made up the BF having family in France just to go on this trip and cause trouble.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is off the rails. You need to do more than yell, you need to set some clear boundaries with her, and hold them when you need to. Someone who would behave like that and then try to gaslight you cannot be trusted. Not just around your boyfriend, but with anything. I wish you lots of luck; you're going to need it.", "She sounds like a pyscho. Potentially pin pricking a condom, false rape accuser, poison your dog for saying no, catfisher. That's a long time to be lusting over your siblings partner. I mean going out with a bloke and going to France for the facade.\n\nWhat if you have kids with this bloke? Don't let her baby sit. I'd actually be cautious of that if it happens she might resent the baby thinking it should have been hers", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is something her bf needs to know. And you and your partner need to keep your distance from her, she is trying to break you up.", "It would benefit both you and your boyfriend to keep distance with her. \n\nYour family defending her stunts sounds dismissive, manipulative, and not pleasant in the slightest - is she their little golden baby? Sexual harassment is never a joke: she's a jealous and ugly person. She clearly doesn't give a shit about your, your bf, or her own bf's feelings - that's not a safe behavior.\n\nNTA, your family surely is - all 3 of them.", "NTA\n\nand, ummmm, can i just say that you need to get away from your sister.  NOW.  there's a whole box of something's-not-right-in-her-head sitting on your doorstep.  she may be your sister, but this will not end well.  at all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
