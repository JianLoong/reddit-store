For example, a black coffee was called a \u2018night owl\u2019. \n\nI had to ask the cashier what a latte was called at the shop and what the sizes meant, because it was labelled like classic, magnum and titanic. I was a little blur and took about 3-5 minutes to order because of this. I apologised to the cashier for the delay and paid. While I was keeping my receipt in my purse and walking over to the pick up counter, I heard the cashier call me a \u2018dumb fucking foreigner\u2019. \n\nI turned back to look at him to see if he was speaking about me, and it turns out he was, because there wasn\u2019t another customer waiting in line and he was still at the register. I was upset by this but did not say anything to him. I just turned around and continued walking to go wait for my drink to be prepared. The person making my drink looked really apologetic and left her station to go into the back. The manager came out a few moments later with the barista and immediately came over to me to ask if the cashier said those things about me. I said yes, but it is fine. I do not want to make it an issue.\n\nThe manager immediately started apologising and she said the employee would be dealt with. I said there really was no need, because I get it, sometimes people have bad days and they get tired. The manager then gave me a voucher for a free drink and asked for my number to contact me.\n\nI got a call today from the manager, and she let me know that the employee has been fired. I feel horrible about this, because I directly caused someone to lose their job over a few words. I\u2019m wrecked with guilt and I told my sister about this and she agrees that I should have just said no to the manager when she asked me about the cashier. AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m seeing a few comments telling me I should have spoken up about it and stood up for myself. I have been in this country for 8 years. I experience some form of racism at least once a day. On public transportation, during road blocks with the police, sometimes when even you enter a store and an employee just chooses to follow you and only you around the store. When I was younger, I never just took it. I always spoke up. But you get older, and it gets tiring having to speak up every time someone pulls some bigot bullshit. It\u2019s mentally exhausting, which is why I choose to just ignore these things now when it doesn\u2019t really impact me. It\u2019s a coffee shop that I\u2019ll probably never go back to again, it wasn\u2019t that deep for me. It wasn\u2019t worth a fight.", "created_utc": 1678387931, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11n0ak4/aita_for_getting_an_employee_fired/", "score": 755, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Racist comments don't fly in any job environment and the sooner he learns that the better off he will be.", "NTA\n\nThe person made a grave mistake- being racist and unprofessional, and unwelcoming. I'd definitely say part of being a batista is being friendly and welcoming when people come to get coffee. No one looking for coffee wants to deal with people with crappy attitudes.\n\nI know you feel bad about someone losing their job, but you need to care about _yourself_ a little more.  People continue to be racist, homophobic, sexist, transphobic and ableist because _they continue to get away with it_. \n\nRacist rude people do not have a place in society. Do not give them a place.

You did not cause this over a few words. The rude, arrogant, childish barista did.

You didn\u2019t initiate anything, you were letting it slide until another employee went and told the manager.  Your only involvement was to be the victim of racism and you truthfully answered a question but stated you didn\u2019t want to take it further.  You did absolutely nothing that warrants you feeling bad.\n\nYou are 100% NTA.  Please stop beating yourself up.  Given how quickly the barista got the manager involved I would guess this was his last strike not his first.", "I work in HR, definitely NTA. You didn\u2019t deserve what was said, nobody does, no matter the events leading up to it and it clearly made their colleague uncomfortable for them to report it.", "NTA. The employee fired themselves", "NTA- Since he's that unpleasant they were probably looking for a legitimate reason to fire him and your experience was the perfect situation. The other employee being uncomfortable enough to report him tells you all you need to know. As a bonus you got to learn that your sister has no problem lying.", "NTA. Anyone who is telling you that you should have lied is wrong. If you had lied, the person who spoke up could have gotten in trouble, and then the rude one would have the ability to say that they were being bullied, etc.", "NTA\n\nYOU didn't get the employee fired. The employee and their nasty words got themselves fired, and rightfully so.", "How exactly is this your fault?\n\nThe **employee's** actions got him fired.

You didn't ask for a manager or complain until asked if he said the things he said. You didn't lie about the interaction. He got himself fired and his co-worker was likely done with his shit and told the manager of his language. Nobody deserves to be treated like that, foreign or not. If you hadn't told the manager when asked, he would likely continue to treat others like shit, which is not right. He got what he deserved for acting like that. Don't feel bad, at all.", "NTA.

Also, let's be very clear about one thing. You did not cause someone to lose their job. The employee said something and the manager fired the employee for it. End of story. Your mere existence was not the cause of the employee being fired.", "NTA, he got himself fired, and it was another employee that brought the actions to the manager.\n\nThing is, this isn't about you, or the comment he made.

You didn\u2019t ask for the manager, you didn\u2019t complain, all you did was honestly answer the managers question when they asked. It sounds like the other employees overheard it and were upset. The fired employee was likely making it a bad workplace to be in if that\u2019s how they acted, don\u2019t feel bad at all.", "Most likely this was not a one time occurrence, the manager did not seem surprised and knew how to handle the situation.  Sorry but having a bad day does not mean you get to insult people with real questions about things.\n\nNTA- employee brought this on himself, he could have said the same thing in his own head and no one would have known.", "NTA, you did not cause that employee to lose his job. He did that on his own when he made the choice to say out loud what he said. He reaped the consequences of his own choices, stop beating yourself up over something you had zero control over.", "NTA. I doubt this was the only incident. Either attitude or cursing has been a repeat problem, or there were clear rules set down from the beginning. \n\nThe shop has to set it's own standards, and this employee wasn't meeting them.", "You didn't' get the employee fired.  The cashier got themselves fired.

AITA?\n\nNTA, and I would just note on this specifically if you said 'No' then the other employee who talked to the manager would be the one in trouble since she would now be accused of lying to get the asshole.in trouble. \n\nIt might have been best if she had asked *you* whether you wanted to escalate before going to the manager, but insofar as you were involved in the situation you didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA - You did not get anyone fired. You were asked if something happened, and you were honest. Your only other option was to lie or pretend you didn't hear - either of which could have gotten the employee who stood up for you in trouble instead. \n\nAnd I doubt the employee got fired over this one incident, this was likely the final straw for them (no pun intended).", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't make a scene, you didn't report it, and the employee is at fault.  When you're in the service industry, you serve.  Comments like that are definitely not appropriate, and that's what got the employee fired.", "NTA You neither directly nor indirectly caused this person to get fired. Their own stupid actions did that. It\u2019s likely not the first time they\u2019ve done something like this and any customer facing position worth it\u2019s salt is going to come with a zero tolerance policy for any type of discrimination. Barista broke the rules, company fired them per policy, end of story.", "NTA\n\nYOU did not get this person fired; their own behaviour did. Kudos to the other barista who went to the manager.\n\nHaving a bad day does not give you a free pass to be an awful person.", "NTA at all.\n\n1) The employee was rude and racist towards YOU. No one wants to be served by such an ugly person. Why on earth would you think you\u2019re the AH?! \n\n2) You didn\u2019t even make a big deal of it - another barista is the one who informed the manager.\n\n3) You even tried to make light of the situation by making excuses for the employee\u2019s unforgivable behaviour. Next time someone is rude like this they deserve to be called out by YOU. \n\n4) You had no control over the decision that the manager would make.\n\nHopefully this teaches the employee a lesson. Sorry that someone treated you that way but you are defo NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe sounds like an a**hole and it sounds like they were just waiting for a reason to fire him.", "NTA\n\nIf this were the first time that particular employee did something like this, he MIGHT have gotten a stern warning and reprimand from the manager.  Or, the manager would be perfectly reasonable in canning the barista on the spot.  In either event, you can scarcely be considered TA for being the victim of verbal abuse.  And BTW the coffee shop should have something posted or printed to define their weird terminology.  \"Night Owl\"???!  Give me a break!  How in the world could a first-time customer possibly decipher that?", "NTA - You didn't get them fired, they did. All you did was confirm that the other employee's version of the story was true. And you wouldn't have been the A H even if you'd gone to the manager. Hate doesn't get to win.\n\nAlso this coffee shop sounds exhausting TBH and I'd take a ton of time to order too - what a weird strategy :)", "NTA of course.\n\nYou didn't even complain.\n\nAs someone who manages people, I would do the same.  We have to give people some level of grace for mistakes, but let me assure you - nobody is saying \"dumb F#@# foreigner\" as a 1-off mistake.", "You didn\u2019t directly cause anything. The employee was way out of line. I suspect this wasn\u2019t a first for this employee and they have been reprimanded before. Also a coffee shop with confusing names like that need to have descriptions or be patient with people who don\u2019t frequent there. \n\nIt\u2019s a little weird that the manager followed up after you insisted you didn\u2019t want to be involved and I can totally understand why you would feel bad.\n\nPlease ease your mind and know this employee learned (hopefully) a valuable lesson on being patient in customer service roles. I know customer service can be a real drag but it sounds like you acted more than appropriately in this situation.\n\nEdit: forgot judgement NTA", "NTA.\n\nThat was entirely NOT on you. You did nothing to create the situation and you attempted to de-escalate it.\n\nAs others have mentioned, this worker may have been a problem for a while and their unacceptable comment towards you was finally the incident they could use to ditch the nasty employee.", "NTA. You may not have the energy to retort against the racism every day anymore, and some people will never have that courage to begin with, and that's okay. But as a POC myself, you just made it so that there's one less racist barista to deal with for the rest of the POC community that gets their coffee there.", "NTA. It\u2019s quite likely you were just the last in the line of customers to receive that type of treatment from the barista.", "NTA-He got himself fired with his words not you.", "NTA. You did nothing to cause the person getting fired. You asked questions, apologized for the delay and there was nobody in line behind you. The cashier made a comment that was waaaaaaay out of line. You didn't cause them to say that, and you didn't report them to the manager (which you would have had every right to do). If you'd lied to the manager about them saying that, the person who made your drink may have gotten in trouble for lying to the manager.", "NTA and its probably not the 1st time he's said shit behind a customers back. He's also a coward.", "NTA. They don\u2019t want to lose customers due to that employee\u2019s behavior. The manager didn\u2019t even say,\u201dhe\u2019s usually not like this\u201d because he is always like that. I recently complained about someone, and before I even finished explaining there was a problem, they knew exactly who it was and the nature of the issue. Some people just should not be in customer service positions.", "Now barista is dumb f\u2019kin unemployed. Good.", "You did NOT get this employee fired. Their abysmal work ethic and xenophobic attitude got them fired. Most work environments have a zero-tolerance policy towards such hurtful behaviour because it costs them customers.\n\nHopefully this now-former employee will learn their lesson and keep such unpleasant thoughts at home and out of the workplace\n\n1000 % NTA", "NTA- if you said no, then you would have made trouble for the other employee that turned him in.  He got himself fired.", "NTA - he was racist and his colleague reported him for it.  If he was that comfortable being a racist pig to you, think how awful he must have been to work with.  \n\nI\u2019m glad you chose to be honest with the manager.  Think how awful it would have been for the person who was brave enough to get the manager if you had denied the incident and made HER look like the liar.  You would have protected a racist jerk and thrown a good person under the bus.", "NTA This employee getting fired was not your fault. It's commendable that you didn't want him fired but I guarantee you that even if you were the first there would have been others. Everyone, including you, deserves to be treated with respect. He needs to learn that. Him getting fired was the right move.", "You did nothing though, except tell the truth when asked. Another employee overheard what the cashier called you, and they reported it. The manager just asked you for confirmation.\n\nIf anything, the other employee got that employee fired. Not you. But that employee deserved it. They didn\u2019t even have the sense to wait till you weren\u2019t within earshot anymore to complain about you. \n\nYou didn\u2019t cause the incident. That racist employee did. It costs 0$ to not be racist, and 0$ to keep one\u2019s mouth shut.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019d be confused about that menu too. What is it with companies over-complicating menus?\n\nNTA", "NTA. You literally did nothing wrong. In fact, you went out of your way to try and ignore the AH. You tried to even de-escalate the situation when the manager got involved. They insulted you, they paid the price. Whether he said it to you or any of the other customers, he would\u2019ve received the same consquences.", "NTA. Even if you would immediately have responded to the words. But now you only answered a question truthfully, as can be expected. It most likely also wasn't the first time the cashier said something like that, that's probabbly why the barista and manager were on top of it. If you don't want to get fired, don't say stupid stuff like that.", "NTA.  Never feel bad that someone lost their job by being so brazen to say what he did.  He got himself fired, not  you.  Congrats to the barista who looks to take matters in their own hands to inform the manager of the highly inappropriate behavior.  It's better to recognize when people have your back, in this case the barista did and then the manager correctly performed their duties.  It's never okay in any way for what you experienced.  Also, the ex employee most likely have done other things if they were so brazen in their actions.  It's okay for people to suffer consequences of their actions.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t even complain! That person is clearly racist and deserves whatever punishment comes towards them.", "You didn\u2019t get him fired. He was overheard and you just honestly answered a question. The guy can get another job; maybe one not in customer service with specialized names that need explanation.\n\nBecause I would been asking too; um a night owl titanic\u2026 is that a 16oz black coffee? Okay so what does\u2026", "NTA.\n\nThat employee fucked around and found out.", "NTA. This incident allowed the coffee shop to get rid of an employee who not only gave the company a bad name, but could have done this to someone who was having a bad day and really hurt them. You deserve better than to be treated like this, and him getting fired absolutely was not your fault.", "NTA if you would have said no then the other employee who reported it could have been accused of lying. You didn\u2019t call the barista out, the coworker did. NTA if you had done it personally. If you didn\u2019t want to say anything you could have requested a refund. As hard as it is the more we let people get away with nasty comments the more they feel free to do it again", "NTA. \n\nAnd absolutely you did the right thing telling the truth.\n\nThat kind of hostility and xenophobia cannot be tolerated.  I hope they learn better and do better.", "NTA This is not the first time he has done this. The fact that the person who was making your drink went to tell the manager, shows that he has done this more than a few times. Since it was directed at you, how you decided to handle it was fine. I'm sure the coffee shop has wanted to fire him but has steps they have to take to fire someone so that if they get sued, they can defend themselves.", "NTA. you did not get an employee fired. you didn't even tell the manager, another employee did because they knew it was wrong. you were just asked if it was true. hopefully the employee who lost their job will learn from this experience.", "NTA. They got themselves fired. This isn't any of your fault.", "There is no interpersonal conflict here.  The manager did his job, you were just a bystander in this.", "NTA - You are not responsible for the employee or manager's actions or their consequences.", "You didn't directly cause anything, that guy was an asshole and deserved to be fired.  Sleep easy, NTA.", "NTA. He chose to say what he did. Here's the thing: it may not have bothered you that he said that, but what about the next person he berates? What if they can't handle the abuse from someone like that? It may not have mentally affected you, but you stopped him from verbally abusing someone who may have been way more upset by it.", "NTA. Sometimes people deserved to be fired. Their actions did this, not you. I don't want a bigot making a coffee", "NTA 100%! You are not responsible for either the employee or manager's actions.", "NTA! Good grief, how did YOU cause the cashier to say something ugly and obviously race-based to you? Just by existing in their eye line? So you took a few extra minutes - so what? There was nobody else in line behind you, by your own account. What was so urgent that the cashier needed to complete the transaction at optimum speed? It's also clear that the barista went and told the manager what she'd heard. If anyone (other than the dumbass who made the gross comment) is to blame for the person being fired, it would be the barista who made the manager aware of comment. \n\nHow/why would you *possibly* be the AH in this scenario? This one seems pretty cut & dried.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn\u2019t get him fired. He got himself fired for being a bigot.", "You didn\u2019t get him fired, he got himself fired. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou didn't do shit, mate, don't feel a shred of guilt. Don't lie to defend racist assholes.", "NTA, but seriously, Y T A to yourself for thinking this way. YOU did NOT get this person fired, directly OR indirectly. HIS actions got him fired, and HIS COWORKER is the one that told the manager about it. This is obviously not a one time occurrence. You were literally doing everything in your power to keep him out of trouble. Don't be a doormat. Stand up for yourself. He deserved to be fired, and you are not in any way responsible for it.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t get them fired. They got themselves fired.", "NTA\n\nI doubt this was the first time this has happened.", "NTA. The cashier had already cast out on their hang glider of racism, its not your obligation, especially as the target of said racism, to get them back on solid ground.", "They seem to have a zero tolerance against harassment. NTA definitely.\n\nAlso, if he said that to you, he would have said that to everyone that ordered, and thats bad for their business", "NTA. You even went out of your way to not make it an issue. It's not your fault the cashier is an asshole and, if it wasn't you, it would have been someone else. Hopefully they learn a lesson from all this but I kind of doubt it.", "NTA.  I would think this wasn\u2019t the first time this has happened and they used your situation as the final straw to terminate", "NTA. they choose to call you that, no excuses. have a nice day/night, op.", "NTA. You didn't get the employee fired. You didn't even report him to the manager-- his coworker did. You should have spoken up about his comments, if not for your own sake for the sake of others.

You\u2019re a kind soul and people like that cashier need to be fired to teach them their actions are unacceptable. I\u2019m sorry you face so much racism.", "NtA.  You didn't get them fired.  They got themselves fired.  Whether they were talking about you or not- they work in a service industry that requires tact and professionalism.  They said something that was out of line and grounds for termination.  100% their fault", "NTA, and while I understand you are exhausted from fighting this fight, please accept when others decide to take up the fight for you when it costs you nothing. :) It was important to that manager not to let racism stand - and that's a good thing.", "NTA\n\nI get not wanting to fight back, that\u2019s valid. But you don\u2019t need to question yourself here at all. You were simply existing and it\u2019s clear this persons coworker recognized that. You literally did nothing wrong and I\u2019m glad that for once someone took up the fight for you.", "NTA  \nYou did nothing wrong.  People like that SHOULD lose their jobs for making comments like that.", "NTA. The employee was an asshole. I agree with you, sometimes people have bad days. I have them too. In a perfect world, we would all be mindful of that. But there's no excuse for someone being a racist. You should bear no responsibility for the barista's ignorant actions, they deserved to get fired for something like that.", "NTA   \n\n\nWhilst you may have wanted to let this slide, and yes people do have bad days but at the very least, don't verbalise it where others can hear, and especially when customer facing.    \n\n\nIt's almost as though it was done intentionally so that you would hear given what you describe.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is clear that other staff and management do care for their customers as well as their reputation.  If he did it to you, how many others has this person done the same thing, or how many times would they do it in the future?   Whilst you might not go back, their actions may have stopped you or others from naming and shaming the shop so for them it's an appropriate business decision, even if you feel un easy about it.", "NTA\n\nYou should have complained but you didn't. Another employee heard it and reported it. \n\nThe fired employee had absolutely no right to say that and I can guarantee you it wasn't the first time or it wouldn't have resulted in a firing. That company had a responsibility to make sure their patrons are safe and they can't do that if they have an employee openly and unapologetically spewing hate and racism.\n\nOP, just because you deal with it every day doesn't mean you have to be accepting of it. You deserve better; please know that about yourself.", "You didn't cause him to be fired. He did \n\n\ud83d\udcaf NTA", "NTA. Why do I keep seeing stories of people feeling bad that they got someone fired because the employee did something bad. \nI got a bouncer fired once. I felt great about it.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't get the person fired, he got himself fired.\n\nSo very sorry you have to go through these types of things on a daily basis.", "NTA, you did absolutely nothing wrong", "NTA! You did nothing to cause this person to get fired. Their own actions caused them to get fired. I'm sorry you had to hear such hateful language directed towards you.", "NTA, grow a spine and speak up for yourself. Kudos to the barista for calling the manager. You didn't get an employee fired, he chose to insult you in front of someone who cared about customer service, so he got what he asked for.", "NTA\u2014you did the right thing and the manager did the right thing.", "NTA. THEIR behavior had consequences for them, not yours. Your empathy, however, is a good example for the rest of us.", "NTA. Please do not feel guilty. You've done nothing wrong. \"...I directly caused someone to lose their job over a few words.\" You did not cause the person to lose their job, that was 100% on them. And it was not over a few words, it was about that person's hateful attitude.", "NTA, that kind of disrespect and rudeness should never be overlooked. They got just what they deserved, unacceptable no matter how their day was going.", "NTA. You are too nice.

For example, a black coffee was called a \u2018night owl\u2019. \n\nI had to ask the cashier what a latte was called at the shop and what the sizes meant, because it was labelled like classic, magnum and titanic. I was a little blur and took about 3-5 minutes to order because of this. I apologised to the cashier for the delay and paid. While I was keeping my receipt in my purse and walking over to the pick up counter, I heard the cashier call me a \u2018dumb fucking foreigner\u2019. \n\nI turned back to look at him to see if he was speaking about me, and it turns out he was, because there wasn\u2019t another customer waiting in line and he was still at the register. I was upset by this but did not say anything to him. I just turned around and continued walking to go wait for my drink to be prepared. The person making my drink looked really apologetic and left her station to go into the back. The manager came out a few moments later with the barista and immediately came over to me to ask if the cashier said those things about me. I said yes, but it is fine. I do not want to make it an issue.\n\nThe manager immediately started apologising and she said the employee would be dealt with. I said there really was no need, because I get it, sometimes people have bad days and they get tired. The manager then gave me a voucher for a free drink and asked for my number to contact me.\n\nI got a call today from the manager, and she let me know that the employee has been fired. I feel horrible about this, because I directly caused someone to lose their job over a few words. I\u2019m wrecked with guilt and I told my sister about this and she agrees that I should have just said no to the manager when she asked me about the cashier. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA\n\nYou didn't cause this.

It\u2019s awful that you experience racism as part of your daily life\u2014I can only imagine how emotionally taxing and demoralizing that must be. I\u2019m glad that this overtly-racist prick had to face the consequences of his actions. I\u2019m glad the other employee spoke up and that the manager took the appropriate action. Despite what your sister said, it would\u2019ve been wrong to lie; doing so might have negatively impacted the honorable employee or discouraged her from addressing racism or other forms of abuse in the future and would almost certainly have emboldened the racist.", "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. The employee's actions caused this, you did nothing wrong.", "You did not directly cause this person to be fired.\n\nIt was a consequence of their actions, their words, and their attitude. By them being dealt with (appropriately IMO), you are shown that this behaviour is not acceptable.\n\nThe cashier said the comments and directed them plainly at you. \nThe person this cashier was working with brought it to their managers attention. \nThe manager checked on what was said. \nYou confirmed what the manager was told by the second barrista.\nThe inital cashier was fired. \n\nI'm going to guess that due to the lack of hesitation from the manager in believing the 2nd barrista, this wasn't a surprise to them to hear that the cashier behaved in this way.

I highly doubt it. NTA", "Nope, NTA. You don't need to lie to protect a xenophobe, and tellig the truth about what he said was a good thing to do.

And I bet this wasn\u2019t the first instance.", "NTA at all. I worked as a barista and a server for years, so I can confidently say that his behavior was unacceptable, and it was his own choices that got him fired. I'm glad the other employee and manager took it seriously. And I just have to say that working in a shop with cutesy names for things means you have to do even MORE explaining than you usually do in customer service, and you still have to do it with a smile. If it's that annoying, it's incredibly likely that there are other food service jobs available where he won't have to explain what a Gargantuan Penguin is.", "And even if they did, it was deserved.", "Absolutely. On my worst day working in customer service I never even dreamed of name calling like that.", "For sure, the employee was used to do that on a regular basis (or other nasty things).

The coworker got him fired, most likely because this wasn\u2019t the first time he talked like that and she was sick of his shit, and if the customer was still in the shop, the manager would actually have to get off their ass and deal with the situation. I do understand your perspective of letting it go, but you did let it go. None of this is on you.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't do anything. By your title, I thought you complained about it and felt guilty later. You didn't even say anything - the other employee overheard and told the manager. Don't feel bad. You did nothing. It's very likely that this wasn't the first occurrence, but the last straw.", "NTA.  If they acted that way towards you they will act that way towards others they perceive to be \"dumb fucking foreigners\".  That is simply not acceptable or in \"having a bad day\" territory.  That's AH territory. \n\nI'm not sure what country you're in but here in the USA an openly racist employee is a HUGE liability for the shop.  It sounds like the racist employee offended their co-workers as well, and it sounds like one of their co-workers may have blown the whistle on the racist, if the manager wasn't there to hear the comment but came to you to ask if the employee had really said what they said. \n\nRacists, especially proudly openly racist racists, deserve to be persona non grata, and they definitely don't belong in any sort of customer service job.  Racist Employee got themself fired by being TA.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. I\u2019m willing to bet that this employee has done stuff like this before and this just happened to be the last straw and the manager was fed up with it.  Employee got himself fired with their shitty attitude and actions.", "NTA", "NTA. It wasn't you though, it was the cashier. There are usually multiple issues before firing or the barista wouldn't have gotten the manager. They may have been told to get the manager if anything happened.", "Nta. She doesn\u2019t want a racist driving her customers away. That\u2019s not your fault.", "You did nothing wrong, that racist ex barista did themselves in. Hard NTA.", "NTA but you absolutely should go back to the coffee shops. More places should deal with racists that way. He caused himself to get fired.", "NTA\n\nI understand that you've become numb to the racism you face and I'm so sorry about that. You did nothing wrong here. That barista is a giant AH and he got himself fired. Guarantee that wasn't the first incident.", "NTA, OP as someone who has worked several customer service jobs there are some things u just dont say in the front. There are mistakes, and any good manager would just talk to the employee to make sure they know. And sometimes u do have bad days, I would get tired and it would show. Not knowing certain things and trying to fix it but getting flustered. Or just being in pain and not hiding it the best. Those are pretty easy to pick up on, if the cashier seems tired and is being a bit impatient then oh well hopefully they have a better day. Even when I was exhausted, in pain, sick of the bs customers, I would never have made a racist comment. U really gotta say that shit keep it in the back or for when the stores empty.", "I loathe xenophobia and racism. I am so sorry that you have had to endure what you have the last 8 years. This person should not be in customer service of any kind if they cannot have the decency to have a bare minimum respect for other human beings. You did nothing wrong here. I think it shows what a generous and kind person you are that you were this worried about it but please.. look at it this way.. it gives this person a chance to reevaluate themselves and how they express their frustration in the future going forward. Some of our most valuable lessons are the most painful. Good luck to you and I wish you well. NTA", "You're going to get a ton of NTAs, which is absolutely how it should be, but you're so exhausted from fighting everyday racism and rude behavior that it seems like part of your coping mechanism is just automatically assuming responsibility for other people's bad behavior.  And I get it, people are exhausting even when you aren't fighting for the modicum of respect you're owed just by being a fellow human being. But I need to point out something that may allow you to absolve yourself of your guilt. \n\nYou literally didn't do anything. You didn't get him fired. There's nothing in this story that you needed to take responsibility for. His colleague overheard him and reported him to their manager. Their manager came out on their own to ask you about the incident. The manager made that decision to fire that employee. \n\nYes, the barista lost his job. And the manager has a very real obligation to their employer and fellow employees to immediately condone and punish that behavior so their employer continues to see profit and their colleagues can continue to have a job. Coffee shops are a dime a dozen, and if they have a reputation for bad service, ain't no one going to be employed there before too long.", "NTA it wasn't just a bad day, it was racist. He deserved to get fired.", "NTA. Hopefully that employee can reflect on their behavior and grow from this. Also as a former barista, I hope that coffee shop fixes their signage because that sounds confusing AF. \n\nOn an unrelated note, what does it mean to be a \u201cblur\u201d?", "NTA! \u2764\ufe0f They deserved to get fired lmao. I\u2019m so sorry you had to experience that from a total mouth breather.", "Honestly the colleague and manager were good people. Nta don\u2019t feel bad.", "NTA. You didn't cause anything. It was the words of the barista, not you.", "NTA, but, yes:  it was worth the fight.  If racism and bigotry are called out at every opportunity, then it will become less frequent.  OP has the right to expect respect and dignity from everyone.", "NTA but just curious - when did you give the manager your phone number? Did the manager frame it as a way to follow up with you on the employee\u2019s status? It sounds like that was your first time there so just curious. :-)", "NTA, you didn't even tell them but even if you did, he got himself fired for his choice of words. Don't feel guilty even for a second.", "You even defended him after what he said? Big NTA.", "I completely understand not making a big deal. People telling you you should have acted differently have had the privilege of not normally being in the receiving end of bigotry. \n\nYou did nothing wrong in anything you did. The barista did when he said that. Honestly, then being fired had little to do with you. The manager realized that having this person  representing their business is simply bad for business. They needed to let this person go for themselves as much as for you\n\nEDIT: to add NTA", "Aww hun, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. At all. You didn\u2019t even report them (which would have still be fine to do!!). Reading your edit, I\u2019m so sorry you have experienced these things. It hurts my heart to hear that people have so much hate just because someone has a different skin color or is from a different country. I wish you all the best. NTA.", "NTA. How do you even think this is your fault? You didn\u2019t ask to speak to a manager. His coworker told the manager which makes me think he\u2019s always rude to customers. Why else would the coworker not just let it go? You told the truth and if it were just a one time thing he may have gotten a warning. He got himself fired. You are definitely NTA here.", "NTA", "100% NTA!!  You did not get that person fired. That person insulted you. That offended their co-worker, who didn\u2019t want to be working with a cruel person.  That co-worker told the manager, who was horrified at the terrible treatment of his/her customer AND at the idea of having a cruel person in their employ.  The coffee house would lose money if they kept that person employed. Their other employees would find better places to work.   \nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you, but don\u2019t feel that you got them fired.  You didn\u2019t.  What you saw was the falling of many pieces into place that ended with the person being fired.  The manager wants you to feel safe to come back to their business. The manager made a choice, they\u2019d rather have you as a customer than that employee at the register.  You didn\u2019t do anything except tell the truth.", "NTA, though I do wish the manager had handled that a tad better, because I think her efforts put a lot of it on you in reporting back about him being fired. I think she's trying to make sure you don't feel unwelcome thinking that they either tolerate or accept the attitudes the cashier had. And sounds like that's why he was fired.... not because you (as an individual) didn't like what he said, but because *they* didn't want him saying that stuff. (none of this is to dismiss situations where someone does complain about something like this, either)", "NTA at all. You did nothing wrong whatsoever. It is so disheartening that people can be so cruel. I\u2019m glad the barista stood up for you and reported this. You don\u2019t deserve treatment like that at all.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't do anything. His own mouth offended his co-worker.  He was reported by his co-worker. He was fired by his boss. You told the truth *when asked.* None of this is on you.", "NTA. You did not cause them to be fired. Their own words caused them to be fired. The fact their coworker immediately went and told the manager speaks volumes. They were the one that alerted the manager to what had been said (rightly so). This person deserved to be fired. Good in the manager and co-worker for not tolerating that language/behaviour.", "NTA.  People almost never get fired over just one bad customer interaction. This was most likely only the most recent of a long string of complaints and he was already on his final warning.  If it wasn't you, it would have been the next customer he didn't like.", "He deserved to be fired. You didn\u2019t cause him to be fired!  He did when he said what he did!   Please be easy on yourself. You did NOTHING wrong!!", "NTA. Let me make something super clear; YOU did not get him fired. HE got himself fired by making disgusting comments about customers on the floor. Do not waste another second of your energy feeling bad about this, because you have nothing to feel bad about. If you liked the coffee, go back to the shop and give that barista a big fat tip for doing the right thing.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't get this employee fired. He got himself fired. This was not his first offense or the baridta would not have gotten the manager.\n\nHe's likely cost the business free food and business on a daily basis.", "NTA. Honestly if they were fired over this it probably wasn't their first time doing these kinds of things. In my experience in food service it takes at least 3 strikes for them to give someone the boot unless its big and explosive and even then they're usually willing to give a second shot. You may have been the straw that broke the camel's back, but there was a load on there before and if not you it would have been someone else.", "Absolutely NTA. If you need any confirmation, their coworker was uncomfortable enough that they informed their manager themselves.\n\nLike everyone else here is saying, that employee got themselves fired.", "NTA, To be honest, it sounds like this was the final situation in a long list of the things this person was doing to get him fired.", "NTA. This employee got what they asked for.", "*You* didn't get anyone fired, *that dumbass cashier* got *himself* fired.

The guy who CHOSE to say something so terrible got what was coming to him. NTA", "NTA. You were simply not at fault for any of this. You are not to blame for your confusion when ordering, and it was wrong of the cashier to badmouth you because of it, behind your back or otherwise. The person making your drink was the one who chose to report it to the manager, with or without your knowledge. And if not you, sooner or later he would have treated some other customer poorly and brought it on himself.", "NTA.\n\nI am sorry that you have gotten beaten down by the micro-aggressions of racist A Hs who think that \"free speech\" gives them license to be hateful without consequences.\n\nAs everyone is pointing, out this jerk got himself fired because I am 100% sure that his training covered the need to be polite to customers and not insult them. \n\nI am also willing to bet that the barista who reported him to the manager was doing a happy dance when she found out he was fired!", "You didn\u2019t cause this person to lose their job.

He got himself fired.", "I dont usually comment on things but I have to say this: this was probably just the straw that broke the camels back.

He got his just desserts.", "NTA. You didn't do ANYTHING but react to a shitty and out of line comment.

There probably has been problems in the past but nothing with enough evidence to act on.", "That single thing alone is enough to be a fireable offense, but most likely he also had other issues which made it easy for the manager to immediate fire him. Also think about this way... let's say the OP wasn't chill about it or someone else was there and just happened to be recording a selfie. It goes viral and that would RUIN the coffeeshop! It would have blown up and they would have spent a lot off effort trying to manage and minimize the damage. The manager was for sure thinking \"phew, I'm glad that the only thing I need to do is fire this guy who is already a dick.\"", "Exactly. Op, your existence is not the reason they were fired; their behavior was. You bear no responsibility for it at all. Frankly, if they were doing that to you, they were doing that to other people and likely would have found themselves jobless sooner or later.

This logically means he meant the insult was that you didn't belong and wanted you to know that. If he said \"fucking idiot\" then rude but he maybe was having a bad day.

Employees, at least capable employees, aren't fired due to one infraction. So, either this person was incompetent at the job or was rude to many people.\n\nNTA and don't worry about it any more. Return to the shop and use the freebie voucher. Or give it to someone else.", "No offense, but this has some serious \"I'm the main character\" vibes.\n\nYou didn't do shit.

You did nothing wrong. Hell, if he were a good employee, he'd have some kind of cheat sheet to help explain all the crazy names for customers. Plus its likely you weren't his first offense.", "NTA. You did nothing but answer truthfully when asked a question. Another employee got the manager. I would bet good money that was not the first time, dude was warned and that was simply the last straw.", "Absolutely nta, I work with costumers as well. I get it sometimes everyone has a bad day and yes I surely had my days where I hung up the phone and just said asshole to the phone or where I waited for the costumer to leave and then complain about him to my colleagues. But here is the difference: I complain about their attitude or entitlement because that I something they can control. I would never complain about looks, weight, clothing, language barriers or other things that people can't control. Being a racist isn't having a bad day. Being a racist is wrong no matter where and when. I get that you got frustrated but maybe instead of feeling guilty try to be hopeful. If more people are gonna be like the barista racism will become less and less. I truly hope that I will life to see that day. You did absolutely nothing wrong", "NTA. you did absolutely nothing wrong and you deserve to stand up for yourself, being honest with the manager was the right thing to do. since he was fired it almost certainly wasn\u2019t his first offense, and even if it was he has NO right to say that about anyone, especially at work and within earshot. his coworkers are probably glad to be rid of him", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. And if you had lied about what the cashier said, you\u2019d just be putting the other employee in a bad spot for making it seem like she was causing drama over nothing. Hopefully that cashier has learned a lesson but if not, it is a blessing for the other staff to no longer need to deal with him regardless.", "NTA. Why on earth do you think you caused this to happen? Because you exist? Because you emigrated? Because you wanted a coffee?\nWere you wrong to do those things?\nIt must be exhausting being the object of racist abuse every day. But you did not create this person's problems.", "NTA. If managemment went that quickly from confirmation to firing, this could have been an escalating situation they've been keeping tabs on.", "NTA employee got himself fired.  You just wanted a latte.  This is what people do at coffee shops.  Insulting customers is NOT what people do.   Likely this had happened many times before", "Nta. You didn't have anything to do with getting him fired. His big a** mouth did. Technically you did everything you could did not get him fired. It probably wasn't the 1st or only incident.", "You did absolutely nothing wrong!

This isn't on you, in anyway.", "NTA. Sounds like you didn't get a fight, the cashier and manager stood up for you and did their job, protecting future customers from the same racist experience.  Yay them.\n\nYou did not cause this person to lose their job.  They pissed away their job all by themselves.", "NTA\n\nPlease consider, it is potentially possible the other employee would have been fired for \u201clying\u201d had you not spoken the truth.\n\nBetter for the employee with the potty mouth to be fired than the one trying to do the right thing.\n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty. If they felt the need to report it AND the manager felt the need to fire them, it was likely not the first time they said something like that.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t make it an issue.

The employee who overheard was directly involved and the Manager who did not want this person working at their place of business because they didn't want to drive off customers(future ones who might not be so \"tired\" or willing to let it slide).  \n\nWhat if the next person this employee insulted posted it to instagram/tiktok, etc  OR filed a civil complaint(or whatever other legal options are available)?  \n\nYou don't have an obligation to do anything about their employee's racism.  It's not on you to be responsible for their vetting process.

Your sister thinks you should have told a lie for the cashier? That's a bizarre conclusion for her to have. Like, I get being tired of dealing with this and choosing not to bring it up yourself. But you were asked point blank if he said what he said. If you had lied for him, you might even have been making things difficult for the employee who went to get the manager. \\*She\\* was bothered, and you confirming what she told the manager prevented her from being painted as a liar.", "Honey, you *should* go back to this coffee shop. The manager is showing you that treating you with respect is important to their business. The cashier *deserved* to be fired.\n\nHis actions got him fired, it has nothing to do with you. It is not your fault at all.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You didn't get the employee fired. It sounds like hearing those kinds of comments made their coworker uncomfortable and that's what got him fired. They obviously felt strongly about it if they went to grab a manager. Telling the truth was the right thing. I understand it can be exhausting to have to fight these sorts of things and preferring to just get on with your day and ignore it. \n\nBut if you had said no after the other employee raised those complaints to the manager, that would have discredited their complaints (if he got fired this is probably not the first thing) and saved his job; making the person deal with listening to their behavior still and possibly getting them in trouble or retaliated against. \n\nIf anything I would have just not given them my phone number and said I would prefer leave it behind me if you didn't want to follow up on the issue.", "You did not cause this person to lose their job.

OP, if you had said no, he didn\u2019t say what he said, the kind employee who was looking out for you might have gotten in trouble instead.
