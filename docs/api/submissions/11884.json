For example, a black coffee was called a \u2018night owl\u2019. \n\nI had to ask the cashier what a latte was called at the shop and what the sizes meant, because it was labelled like classic, magnum and titanic. I was a little blur and took about 3-5 minutes to order because of this. I apologised to the cashier for the delay and paid. While I was keeping my receipt in my purse and walking over to the pick up counter, I heard the cashier call me a \u2018dumb fucking foreigner\u2019. \n\nI turned back to look at him to see if he was speaking about me, and it turns out he was, because there wasn\u2019t another customer waiting in line and he was still at the register. I was upset by this but did not say anything to him. I just turned around and continued walking to go wait for my drink to be prepared. The person making my drink looked really apologetic and left her station to go into the back. The manager came out a few moments later with the barista and immediately came over to me to ask if the cashier said those things about me. I said yes, but it is fine. I do not want to make it an issue.\n\nThe manager immediately started apologising and she said the employee would be dealt with. I said there really was no need, because I get it, sometimes people have bad days and they get tired. The manager then gave me a voucher for a free drink and asked for my number to contact me.\n\nI got a call today from the manager, and she let me know that the employee has been fired. I feel horrible about this, because I directly caused someone to lose their job over a few words. I\u2019m wrecked with guilt and I told my sister about this and she agrees that I should have just said no to the manager when she asked me about the cashier. AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m seeing a few comments telling me I should have spoken up about it and stood up for myself. I have been in this country for 8 years. I experience some form of racism at least once a day. On public transportation, during road blocks with the police, sometimes when even you enter a store and an employee just chooses to follow you and only you around the store. When I was younger, I never just took it. I always spoke up. But you get older, and it gets tiring having to speak up every time someone pulls some bigot bullshit. It\u2019s mentally exhausting, which is why I choose to just ignore these things now when it doesn\u2019t really impact me. It\u2019s a coffee shop that I\u2019ll probably never go back to again, it wasn\u2019t that deep for me. It wasn\u2019t worth a fight.", "created_utc": 1678387931, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11n0ak4/aita_for_getting_an_employee_fired/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Racist comments don't fly in any job environment and the sooner he learns that the better off he will be.", "NTA\n\nThe person made a grave mistake- being racist and unprofessional, and unwelcoming. I'd definitely say part of being a batista is being friendly and welcoming when people come to get coffee. No one looking for coffee wants to deal with people with crappy attitudes.\n\nI know you feel bad about someone losing their job, but you need to care about _yourself_ a little more.  People continue to be racist, homophobic, sexist, transphobic and ableist because _they continue to get away with it_. \n\nRacist rude people do not have a place in society. Do not give them a place.

You did not cause this over a few words. The rude, arrogant, childish barista did.

You didn\u2019t initiate anything, you were letting it slide until another employee went and told the manager.  Your only involvement was to be the victim of racism and you truthfully answered a question but stated you didn\u2019t want to take it further.  You did absolutely nothing that warrants you feeling bad.\n\nYou are 100% NTA.  Please stop beating yourself up.  Given how quickly the barista got the manager involved I would guess this was his last strike not his first.", "I work in HR, definitely NTA. You didn\u2019t deserve what was said, nobody does, no matter the events leading up to it and it clearly made their colleague uncomfortable for them to report it.", "NTA. The employee fired themselves", "NTA- Since he's that unpleasant they were probably looking for a legitimate reason to fire him and your experience was the perfect situation. The other employee being uncomfortable enough to report him tells you all you need to know. As a bonus you got to learn that your sister has no problem lying.", "NTA. Anyone who is telling you that you should have lied is wrong. If you had lied, the person who spoke up could have gotten in trouble, and then the rude one would have the ability to say that they were being bullied, etc.", "NTA\n\nYOU didn't get the employee fired. The employee and their nasty words got themselves fired, and rightfully so.", "How exactly is this your fault?\n\nThe **employee's** actions got him fired.

You didn't ask for a manager or complain until asked if he said the things he said. You didn't lie about the interaction. He got himself fired and his co-worker was likely done with his shit and told the manager of his language. Nobody deserves to be treated like that, foreign or not. If you hadn't told the manager when asked, he would likely continue to treat others like shit, which is not right. He got what he deserved for acting like that. Don't feel bad, at all.", "NTA.

Also, let's be very clear about one thing. You did not cause someone to lose their job. The employee said something and the manager fired the employee for it. End of story. Your mere existence was not the cause of the employee being fired.", "NTA, he got himself fired, and it was another employee that brought the actions to the manager.\n\nThing is, this isn't about you, or the comment he made.

You didn\u2019t ask for the manager, you didn\u2019t complain, all you did was honestly answer the managers question when they asked. It sounds like the other employees overheard it and were upset. The fired employee was likely making it a bad workplace to be in if that\u2019s how they acted, don\u2019t feel bad at all.", "Most likely this was not a one time occurrence, the manager did not seem surprised and knew how to handle the situation.  Sorry but having a bad day does not mean you get to insult people with real questions about things.\n\nNTA- employee brought this on himself, he could have said the same thing in his own head and no one would have known.", "NTA, you did not cause that employee to lose his job. He did that on his own when he made the choice to say out loud what he said. He reaped the consequences of his own choices, stop beating yourself up over something you had zero control over.", "NTA. I doubt this was the only incident. Either attitude or cursing has been a repeat problem, or there were clear rules set down from the beginning. \n\nThe shop has to set it's own standards, and this employee wasn't meeting them.", "You didn't' get the employee fired.  The cashier got themselves fired.

AITA?\n\nNTA, and I would just note on this specifically if you said 'No' then the other employee who talked to the manager would be the one in trouble since she would now be accused of lying to get the asshole.in trouble. \n\nIt might have been best if she had asked *you* whether you wanted to escalate before going to the manager, but insofar as you were involved in the situation you didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA - You did not get anyone fired. You were asked if something happened, and you were honest. Your only other option was to lie or pretend you didn't hear - either of which could have gotten the employee who stood up for you in trouble instead. \n\nAnd I doubt the employee got fired over this one incident, this was likely the final straw for them (no pun intended).", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't make a scene, you didn't report it, and the employee is at fault.  When you're in the service industry, you serve.  Comments like that are definitely not appropriate, and that's what got the employee fired.", "NTA You neither directly nor indirectly caused this person to get fired. Their own stupid actions did that. It\u2019s likely not the first time they\u2019ve done something like this and any customer facing position worth it\u2019s salt is going to come with a zero tolerance policy for any type of discrimination. Barista broke the rules, company fired them per policy, end of story.", "NTA\n\nYOU did not get this person fired; their own behaviour did. Kudos to the other barista who went to the manager.\n\nHaving a bad day does not give you a free pass to be an awful person.", "NTA at all.\n\n1) The employee was rude and racist towards YOU. No one wants to be served by such an ugly person. Why on earth would you think you\u2019re the AH?! \n\n2) You didn\u2019t even make a big deal of it - another barista is the one who informed the manager.\n\n3) You even tried to make light of the situation by making excuses for the employee\u2019s unforgivable behaviour. Next time someone is rude like this they deserve to be called out by YOU. \n\n4) You had no control over the decision that the manager would make.\n\nHopefully this teaches the employee a lesson. Sorry that someone treated you that way but you are defo NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe sounds like an a**hole and it sounds like they were just waiting for a reason to fire him.", "NTA\n\nIf this were the first time that particular employee did something like this, he MIGHT have gotten a stern warning and reprimand from the manager.  Or, the manager would be perfectly reasonable in canning the barista on the spot.  In either event, you can scarcely be considered TA for being the victim of verbal abuse.  And BTW the coffee shop should have something posted or printed to define their weird terminology.  \"Night Owl\"???!  Give me a break!  How in the world could a first-time customer possibly decipher that?", "NTA - You didn't get them fired, they did. All you did was confirm that the other employee's version of the story was true. And you wouldn't have been the A H even if you'd gone to the manager. Hate doesn't get to win.\n\nAlso this coffee shop sounds exhausting TBH and I'd take a ton of time to order too - what a weird strategy :)", "NTA of course.\n\nYou didn't even complain.\n\nAs someone who manages people, I would do the same.  We have to give people some level of grace for mistakes, but let me assure you - nobody is saying \"dumb F#@# foreigner\" as a 1-off mistake.", "You didn\u2019t directly cause anything. The employee was way out of line. I suspect this wasn\u2019t a first for this employee and they have been reprimanded before. Also a coffee shop with confusing names like that need to have descriptions or be patient with people who don\u2019t frequent there. \n\nIt\u2019s a little weird that the manager followed up after you insisted you didn\u2019t want to be involved and I can totally understand why you would feel bad.\n\nPlease ease your mind and know this employee learned (hopefully) a valuable lesson on being patient in customer service roles. I know customer service can be a real drag but it sounds like you acted more than appropriately in this situation.\n\nEdit: forgot judgement NTA", "NTA.\n\nThat was entirely NOT on you. You did nothing to create the situation and you attempted to de-escalate it.\n\nAs others have mentioned, this worker may have been a problem for a while and their unacceptable comment towards you was finally the incident they could use to ditch the nasty employee.", "NTA. You may not have the energy to retort against the racism every day anymore, and some people will never have that courage to begin with, and that's okay. But as a POC myself, you just made it so that there's one less racist barista to deal with for the rest of the POC community that gets their coffee there.", "NTA. It\u2019s quite likely you were just the last in the line of customers to receive that type of treatment from the barista.", "NTA-He got himself fired with his words not you.", "NTA. You did nothing to cause the person getting fired. You asked questions, apologized for the delay and there was nobody in line behind you. The cashier made a comment that was waaaaaaay out of line. You didn't cause them to say that, and you didn't report them to the manager (which you would have had every right to do). If you'd lied to the manager about them saying that, the person who made your drink may have gotten in trouble for lying to the manager.", "NTA and its probably not the 1st time he's said shit behind a customers back. He's also a coward.", "NTA. They don\u2019t want to lose customers due to that employee\u2019s behavior. The manager didn\u2019t even say,\u201dhe\u2019s usually not like this\u201d because he is always like that. I recently complained about someone, and before I even finished explaining there was a problem, they knew exactly who it was and the nature of the issue. Some people just should not be in customer service positions.", "Now barista is dumb f\u2019kin unemployed. Good.", "You did NOT get this employee fired. Their abysmal work ethic and xenophobic attitude got them fired. Most work environments have a zero-tolerance policy towards such hurtful behaviour because it costs them customers.\n\nHopefully this now-former employee will learn their lesson and keep such unpleasant thoughts at home and out of the workplace\n\n1000 % NTA", "NTA- if you said no, then you would have made trouble for the other employee that turned him in.  He got himself fired.", "NTA - he was racist and his colleague reported him for it.  If he was that comfortable being a racist pig to you, think how awful he must have been to work with.  \n\nI\u2019m glad you chose to be honest with the manager.  Think how awful it would have been for the person who was brave enough to get the manager if you had denied the incident and made HER look like the liar.  You would have protected a racist jerk and thrown a good person under the bus.", "NTA This employee getting fired was not your fault. It's commendable that you didn't want him fired but I guarantee you that even if you were the first there would have been others. Everyone, including you, deserves to be treated with respect. He needs to learn that. Him getting fired was the right move.", "You did nothing though, except tell the truth when asked. Another employee overheard what the cashier called you, and they reported it. The manager just asked you for confirmation.\n\nIf anything, the other employee got that employee fired. Not you. But that employee deserved it. They didn\u2019t even have the sense to wait till you weren\u2019t within earshot anymore to complain about you. \n\nYou didn\u2019t cause the incident. That racist employee did. It costs 0$ to not be racist, and 0$ to keep one\u2019s mouth shut.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019d be confused about that menu too. What is it with companies over-complicating menus?\n\nNTA", "NTA. You literally did nothing wrong. In fact, you went out of your way to try and ignore the AH. You tried to even de-escalate the situation when the manager got involved. They insulted you, they paid the price. Whether he said it to you or any of the other customers, he would\u2019ve received the same consquences.", "NTA. Even if you would immediately have responded to the words. But now you only answered a question truthfully, as can be expected. It most likely also wasn't the first time the cashier said something like that, that's probabbly why the barista and manager were on top of it. If you don't want to get fired, don't say stupid stuff like that.", "NTA.  Never feel bad that someone lost their job by being so brazen to say what he did.  He got himself fired, not  you.  Congrats to the barista who looks to take matters in their own hands to inform the manager of the highly inappropriate behavior.  It's better to recognize when people have your back, in this case the barista did and then the manager correctly performed their duties.  It's never okay in any way for what you experienced.  Also, the ex employee most likely have done other things if they were so brazen in their actions.  It's okay for people to suffer consequences of their actions.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t even complain! That person is clearly racist and deserves whatever punishment comes towards them.", "You didn\u2019t get him fired. He was overheard and you just honestly answered a question. The guy can get another job; maybe one not in customer service with specialized names that need explanation.\n\nBecause I would been asking too; um a night owl titanic\u2026 is that a 16oz black coffee? Okay so what does\u2026", "NTA.\n\nThat employee fucked around and found out.", "NTA. This incident allowed the coffee shop to get rid of an employee who not only gave the company a bad name, but could have done this to someone who was having a bad day and really hurt them. You deserve better than to be treated like this, and him getting fired absolutely was not your fault.", "NTA if you would have said no then the other employee who reported it could have been accused of lying. You didn\u2019t call the barista out, the coworker did. NTA if you had done it personally. If you didn\u2019t want to say anything you could have requested a refund. As hard as it is the more we let people get away with nasty comments the more they feel free to do it again", "NTA. \n\nAnd absolutely you did the right thing telling the truth.\n\nThat kind of hostility and xenophobia cannot be tolerated.  I hope they learn better and do better.", "NTA This is not the first time he has done this. The fact that the person who was making your drink went to tell the manager, shows that he has done this more than a few times. Since it was directed at you, how you decided to handle it was fine. I'm sure the coffee shop has wanted to fire him but has steps they have to take to fire someone so that if they get sued, they can defend themselves.", "NTA. you did not get an employee fired. you didn't even tell the manager, another employee did because they knew it was wrong. you were just asked if it was true. hopefully the employee who lost their job will learn from this experience.", "NTA. They got themselves fired. This isn't any of your fault.", "There is no interpersonal conflict here.  The manager did his job, you were just a bystander in this.", "NTA - You are not responsible for the employee or manager's actions or their consequences.", "You didn't directly cause anything, that guy was an asshole and deserved to be fired.  Sleep easy, NTA.", "NTA. He chose to say what he did. Here's the thing: it may not have bothered you that he said that, but what about the next person he berates? What if they can't handle the abuse from someone like that? It may not have mentally affected you, but you stopped him from verbally abusing someone who may have been way more upset by it.", "NTA. Sometimes people deserved to be fired. Their actions did this, not you. I don't want a bigot making a coffee", "NTA 100%! You are not responsible for either the employee or manager's actions.", "NTA! Good grief, how did YOU cause the cashier to say something ugly and obviously race-based to you? Just by existing in their eye line? So you took a few extra minutes - so what? There was nobody else in line behind you, by your own account. What was so urgent that the cashier needed to complete the transaction at optimum speed? It's also clear that the barista went and told the manager what she'd heard. If anyone (other than the dumbass who made the gross comment) is to blame for the person being fired, it would be the barista who made the manager aware of comment. \n\nHow/why would you *possibly* be the AH in this scenario? This one seems pretty cut & dried.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn\u2019t get him fired. He got himself fired for being a bigot.", "You didn\u2019t get him fired, he got himself fired. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou didn't do shit, mate, don't feel a shred of guilt. Don't lie to defend racist assholes.", "NTA, but seriously, Y T A to yourself for thinking this way. YOU did NOT get this person fired, directly OR indirectly. HIS actions got him fired, and HIS COWORKER is the one that told the manager about it. This is obviously not a one time occurrence. You were literally doing everything in your power to keep him out of trouble. Don't be a doormat. Stand up for yourself. He deserved to be fired, and you are not in any way responsible for it.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t get them fired. They got themselves fired.", "NTA\n\nI doubt this was the first time this has happened.", "NTA. The cashier had already cast out on their hang glider of racism, its not your obligation, especially as the target of said racism, to get them back on solid ground.", "They seem to have a zero tolerance against harassment. NTA definitely.\n\nAlso, if he said that to you, he would have said that to everyone that ordered, and thats bad for their business", "NTA. You even went out of your way to not make it an issue. It's not your fault the cashier is an asshole and, if it wasn't you, it would have been someone else. Hopefully they learn a lesson from all this but I kind of doubt it.", "NTA.  I would think this wasn\u2019t the first time this has happened and they used your situation as the final straw to terminate", "NTA. they choose to call you that, no excuses. have a nice day/night, op.", "NTA. You didn't get the employee fired. You didn't even report him to the manager-- his coworker did. You should have spoken up about his comments, if not for your own sake for the sake of others.

You\u2019re a kind soul and people like that cashier need to be fired to teach them their actions are unacceptable. I\u2019m sorry you face so much racism.", "NtA.  You didn't get them fired.  They got themselves fired.  Whether they were talking about you or not- they work in a service industry that requires tact and professionalism.  They said something that was out of line and grounds for termination.  100% their fault", "NTA, and while I understand you are exhausted from fighting this fight, please accept when others decide to take up the fight for you when it costs you nothing. :) It was important to that manager not to let racism stand - and that's a good thing.", "NTA\n\nI get not wanting to fight back, that\u2019s valid. But you don\u2019t need to question yourself here at all. You were simply existing and it\u2019s clear this persons coworker recognized that. You literally did nothing wrong and I\u2019m glad that for once someone took up the fight for you.", "NTA  \nYou did nothing wrong.  People like that SHOULD lose their jobs for making comments like that.", "NTA. The employee was an asshole. I agree with you, sometimes people have bad days. I have them too. In a perfect world, we would all be mindful of that. But there's no excuse for someone being a racist. You should bear no responsibility for the barista's ignorant actions, they deserved to get fired for something like that.", "NTA   \n\n\nWhilst you may have wanted to let this slide, and yes people do have bad days but at the very least, don't verbalise it where others can hear, and especially when customer facing.    \n\n\nIt's almost as though it was done intentionally so that you would hear given what you describe.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is clear that other staff and management do care for their customers as well as their reputation.  If he did it to you, how many others has this person done the same thing, or how many times would they do it in the future?   Whilst you might not go back, their actions may have stopped you or others from naming and shaming the shop so for them it's an appropriate business decision, even if you feel un easy about it.", "NTA\n\nYou should have complained but you didn't. Another employee heard it and reported it. \n\nThe fired employee had absolutely no right to say that and I can guarantee you it wasn't the first time or it wouldn't have resulted in a firing. That company had a responsibility to make sure their patrons are safe and they can't do that if they have an employee openly and unapologetically spewing hate and racism.\n\nOP, just because you deal with it every day doesn't mean you have to be accepting of it. You deserve better; please know that about yourself.", "You didn't cause him to be fired. He did \n\n\ud83d\udcaf NTA", "NTA. Why do I keep seeing stories of people feeling bad that they got someone fired because the employee did something bad. \nI got a bouncer fired once. I felt great about it.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't get the person fired, he got himself fired.\n\nSo very sorry you have to go through these types of things on a daily basis.", "NTA, you did absolutely nothing wrong", "NTA! You did nothing to cause this person to get fired. Their own actions caused them to get fired. I'm sorry you had to hear such hateful language directed towards you.", "NTA, grow a spine and speak up for yourself. Kudos to the barista for calling the manager. You didn't get an employee fired, he chose to insult you in front of someone who cared about customer service, so he got what he asked for.", "NTA\u2014you did the right thing and the manager did the right thing.", "NTA. THEIR behavior had consequences for them, not yours. Your empathy, however, is a good example for the rest of us.", "NTA. Please do not feel guilty. You've done nothing wrong. \"...I directly caused someone to lose their job over a few words.\" You did not cause the person to lose their job, that was 100% on them. And it was not over a few words, it was about that person's hateful attitude.", "NTA, that kind of disrespect and rudeness should never be overlooked. They got just what they deserved, unacceptable no matter how their day was going.", "NTA. You are too nice.

This isn\u2019t on you, you didn\u2019t make him say that, nor did you even report him! You simply answered a question honestly. And if you told the manager no?

For example, a black coffee was called a \u2018night owl\u2019. \n\nI had to ask the cashier what a latte was called at the shop and what the sizes meant, because it was labelled like classic, magnum and titanic. I was a little blur and took about 3-5 minutes to order because of this. I apologised to the cashier for the delay and paid. While I was keeping my receipt in my purse and walking over to the pick up counter, I heard the cashier call me a \u2018dumb fucking foreigner\u2019. \n\nI turned back to look at him to see if he was speaking about me, and it turns out he was, because there wasn\u2019t another customer waiting in line and he was still at the register. I was upset by this but did not say anything to him. I just turned around and continued walking to go wait for my drink to be prepared. The person making my drink looked really apologetic and left her station to go into the back. The manager came out a few moments later with the barista and immediately came over to me to ask if the cashier said those things about me. I said yes, but it is fine. I do not want to make it an issue.\n\nThe manager immediately started apologising and she said the employee would be dealt with. I said there really was no need, because I get it, sometimes people have bad days and they get tired. The manager then gave me a voucher for a free drink and asked for my number to contact me.\n\nI got a call today from the manager, and she let me know that the employee has been fired. I feel horrible about this, because I directly caused someone to lose their job over a few words. I\u2019m wrecked with guilt and I told my sister about this and she agrees that I should have just said no to the manager when she asked me about the cashier. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA\n\nYou didn't cause this. He said those nasty words. \n\nI get you not wanting to cause problems for people but holding someone accountable who has no issue saying and being cruel isnt making problems. It's them doing it to themselves.", "NTA. His actions are the direct and sole cause of his firing. It\u2019s awful that you experience racism as part of your daily life\u2014I can only imagine how emotionally taxing and demoralizing that must be. I\u2019m glad that this overtly-racist prick had to face the consequences of his actions. I\u2019m glad the other employee spoke up and that the manager took the appropriate action. Despite what your sister said, it would\u2019ve been wrong to lie; doing so might have negatively impacted the honorable employee or discouraged her from addressing racism or other forms of abuse in the future and would almost certainly have emboldened the racist.", "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. The employee's actions caused this, you did nothing wrong.", "You did not directly cause this person to be fired.\n\nIt was a consequence of their actions, their words, and their attitude. By them being dealt with (appropriately IMO), you are shown that this behaviour is not acceptable.\n\nThe cashier said the comments and directed them plainly at you. \nThe person this cashier was working with brought it to their managers attention. \nThe manager checked on what was said. \nYou confirmed what the manager was told by the second barrista.\nThe inital cashier was fired. \n\nI'm going to guess that due to the lack of hesitation from the manager in believing the 2nd barrista, this wasn't a surprise to them to hear that the cashier behaved in this way. In absolutely *no way* was this your fault.\n\nNTA", "By not speaking up, you shape the textile of your city. You did the right thing. And that idiot needed to learn that lesson, right there, and at that time. Let go of the guilt. This was definitely one time to stand up to the racism in a safe environment (via the manager).", "\nNTA. Chances are, it wasn't even their first offense. The manager did the right thing by firing the racist employee.", "NTA *you* didn\u2019t cause the employee to get fired. They caused themselves to get fired by making a shitty comment. It\u2019s nice how understanding you are, but in this case the dude didn\u2019t need compassion, he needed to understand that his actions have consequences- especially in a customer based workplace.", "NTA\n\nalso, not really the point here, but who the hell  is going to immediately understand a random shop's size names/ drink names?", "I wouldn't want a bigot working for me either, especially in a public facing role.", "You\u2019re NTA. You didn\u2019t get them fired, their lack of professionalism got them fired. \nIf it wasn\u2019t you, it would\u2019ve been the next guy.", "NTA. \n\n> I told my sister about this and she agrees that I should have just said no to the manager when she asked me about the cashier. \n\nI don\u2019t get this. Is your sister saying you should have lied and gotten the nice barista in trouble for suggesting they were lying about the racist cashier and potentially getting the barista fired instead?", "NTA. And if he was willing to insult you, he was quite willing to insult others as well. \n\nDon't think of it as \"I got him fired\" because you didn't - it's more \"He got himself fired with his abusive freakin' mouth and I just happened to be the one there when he was finally caught.\"", "NTA, and you wouldn't even have been the asshole if you intervened and reported them.", "NTA. You did not get anyone fired. The employee got himself fired. You didn\u2019t report him. If you had lied, the employee who stood up for you would have been fired for trying to cause trouble.", "NTA, the cashier got himself fired. Somehow I think this wasn't the first issue with this cashier but it was the final straw for him.", "All you did was confirm that the guy made those comments and it's not up to you to lie to protect him.  Also, you actually helped him because he has been freed up to find a job where he's a better fit.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nBut like nearly on the verge for trying to spare this guy. Think about people in the future who are gonna come there and how he is gonna treat them. You don't need to go out of your way to get him fire but please don't go out of your way to protect him when his coworkers caught him. Have you considered maybe the coworker who reported has wanted to get rid of him because he's like this more frequently? People aren't just randomly bigoted out of the blue typically, it often speaks to deeper recurring views", "I\u2019m going to say this employee has been a problem before and this was the last chance. Nobody needs to say stuff like that to anyone regardless of how their day is going", "Let me say something that is quite obvious.\n\nYou.did.not.make.him.lose.his.job.\n\nHE DID.\n\nDo you honestly think that you were the first person to experience his abusive comments? I highly doubt it. NTA", "Nope, NTA. You don't need to lie to protect a xenophobe, and tellig the truth about what he said was a good thing to do. Everybody else in this scenario realized right away how messed-up what he said is and took action to prevent him from insulting a customer within earshot of said customer again, and the xenophobe has now experienced the consequences of his actions.", "NTA. He made the comment that cost him his job not you.", "NTA, the bigoted trash took itself out.", "Nta and even if you were actively trying to get a bigot fired you still wouldn't be.", "NTA. He failed at his job (to provide courteous service to customers who are behaving in socially appropriate ways), and he got fired because of it. Not your fault. I'm sorry you had to experience that.", "NtA. You didn\u2019t do anything. It was their own words and actions that caused them to get fired. And I bet this wasn\u2019t the first instance.", "NTA at all. I worked as a barista and a server for years, so I can confidently say that his behavior was unacceptable, and it was his own choices that got him fired. I'm glad the other employee and manager took it seriously. And I just have to say that working in a shop with cutesy names for things means you have to do even MORE explaining than you usually do in customer service, and you still have to do it with a smile. If it's that annoying, it's incredibly likely that there are other food service jobs available where he won't have to explain what a Gargantuan Penguin is.", "And even if they did, it was deserved.", "Absolutely. On my worst day working in customer service I never even dreamed of name calling like that.", "For sure, the employee was used to do that on a regular basis (or other nasty things). That's why they were so quick to handle the issue. OP was just the last straw.", "Came here to say this exactly. NTA.", "And no,  you do not need to risk your health and safety standing up to a h's.", "This is the answer", "Yep. This is me.\n\nI try different coffee shops, and plenty of them have different names for cup sizes and some have weird coffee names.\n\nI order a large cap. They've always managed to figure it out. No, I'm not saying grande. You're not Starbucks and if you were, I wouldn't be here cause that coffee is foul.", "May not have been a big deal to OP but if he said this to someone else? He deserved to be fired.", "Also the co worker told the manager so even if OP wanted nothing done to this loser, the manager had the obligation to fix it regardless if OP said otherwise. It wasn't OPs decision.", "Eh even on my most frustrating days in food service or retail I never had the uncontrollable urge to be xenophobic.", "Yep. Starbucks is gross, but on the off chance that it\u2019s my only option, they still aren\u2019t getting me to say venti or whatever.", "Just talk to him and tell him to never do it again.", "The manager could have just spoken to the employee first.\n\nIt doesn't make any sense for it to go down the way it did \n\nManager: \"I'm so sorry, I'll punish them!\"\n\nOp: \"please don't, I don't care and I don't want that to happen\"\n\n*Manager calls OP*\n\nManager: \"So sorry again! I did that think you told me not to do by the way!\"\n\nIf you're the hardass manager and really want to fire this kid over this one incident that didn't cause an issue, then WHY WOULD YOU CALL THE CUSTOMER WHO TOLD YOU NOT TO? lol Do it for your own benefit if you're going to be a hardass, don't call me and pretend like you did it for me when I said \"dont\"", "If it's my only option, I go without coffee that day \ud83d\ude05"]}
