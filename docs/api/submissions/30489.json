I work a lot of overtime because I hate working. So I usually work like a mad man for seven months of the year and take the other five off.   \nMy brother is a teacher and the first person in our family to graduate from university. I have always been proud of him and he is actually pretty awesome. He married another teacher and they have two boys. His wife comes from a family of educated people. I think most of her relatives are college educated.   \nMy wife and I are expecting our first child and we had my parents and my brother's family over so we could announce it. I spent the day getting my smoker going early and we set up for what I thought was going to be a nice visit and announcement.   \nFull disclosure, my wife and I currently live in a manufactured home (mobile home). We keep it tidy and it has city water and power.   \nI'm not sure why but my sister-in-law decided that before dinner was the perfect time to tell her children that they needed to stay in school if they didn't want to end up like me and my wife.   \nI saw red and was about to let her have it but my mom and brother told her that she was being rude and that she needed to apologize. She didn't. She doubled down and said that we were doing okay for the two of us but what if we wanted a child. She just didn't want her kids to end up like us.   \nI told my brother he needed to tell her to shut up or they needed to leave. She said that she was just thinking about our future and our children's future.   \nI told her then that my kids would probably be okay as soon as her husband paid me back for his education that I paid for. My brother has no student loans because I paid for his education. I told her that my current house wasn't great but that the construction across the road was our new house we were having built since my wife and I owned the quarter section of land our trailer is on. I then told her that since I make more money than her and my brother combined while only working a little over half a year I think we will be okay.   \nI would not actually call in the loan to my brother. I know that they are living just within their means and do not have the money to pay me back.   \nShe got embarrassed and they left. I told my parents about the baby and we had a shit tonne of left overs since four people left.   \nMy parents, my wife, and my brother all said that I didn't need to lose my cool with her and that she meant well. My mom said that I was vulgar to point out how much money I make. I don't know. I hated myself for pointing out that my brother is poor compared to me but I didn't start the conversation.

None of what she said was in the best interest of you and your wife. She used your living situation, that she knows nothing about, as a life lesson for her kids to finish school. That's was so rude.\n\nAlso, it's funny how you feel bad for bringing your brother into this, but he did nothing to back you up or tell his own wife how wrong she is.\n\nHonestly, your brother should pay you back his school loan. He is happy to take your money and then let his wife bash the way you live. Thays not cool, and you need to have a serious talk with just you and your brother.\n\nAlso, you taught your nephews a valuable lesson. Never judge a book by its cover.

I do believe, on average, it makes life easier. However, teaching your children to look down on anyone, especially an uncle is bad parenting. Furthermore, when my children get older, I will absolutely tell them that there are tons of skilled jobs out there that do not require getting an academic education and that pay quite well.\n\nIf my children choose to become a teacher (I'm assuming your brother is a teacher at the elementary or high school level), I'll absolutely support them, but I'll use my own personal history to make sure they know it's one of the most stressful, worst paid jobs (relative to the required education level and expected non-contractual duties) out there. I taught high school physics (and chemistry and physical science) for two years, then quit to a much higher paying job at a place with much fewer expectations. And I've only found better paying jobs with fewer expectations since then.", "I honestly don\u2019t know why people that are college educated shit on tradespeople soooo much (not all but A LOT).

I will admit I don\u2019t have a degree and my family harps on me at every turn. \n\nTradespeople are NECESSARY for regular life to function and their pay should reflect that.

Maybe now she will learn not to judge people so rudely. How dare she come into your own house and start ridiculing you and your wife. Disrespectful! Yeah maybe it sucks for your brother that you revealed the facts but the truth is the truth and your mom is wrong... It wasn't vulgar to admit how financially sound you are.

It says a lot about her that she doesn\u2019t know the state of affairs of her BIL or her own husband.

Hopefully the teacher learns a lesson from this, but I doubt that.

Bloody well done you for standing up for yourself and showing her children the reality of the situation. NTA", "NTA. She doubled down with her condescending attitude towards yow and your wife finances. Her sons were able to see what happens when your mouth writes a check your ass can\u2019t cash. Hmm, to have been a fly in the car on the ride home. \nI also think some of the blame is on your brother. He should be just as proud of you and your accomplishments. How family helps one another. He should be trying to raise his sons to support one another like you did with him. And I\u2019m not saying financially.

She doubled down, was rude and you just feed her some facts. Now she\u2019s upset? I would feel low pity for her. However, maybe it does require a repair conversation with her (was their tone, anger etc?) but also worth addressing her education bias here (btw I got a masters at uni and in no way believe it makes a person better or more successful). She has an unconscious bias and it\u2019s all levels of wrong.

I see that some people are saying that you shouldn't have shoved it down her throat, and I disagree. She was asked to apologize by your brother and rather than realizing that she was being classless, she doubled down and made it about her children.\n\nIn that situation, you are definitely right to explain to her that you should never judge a book by its cover and provide receipts too.

I work a lot of overtime because I hate working. So I usually work like a mad man for seven months of the year and take the other five off.   \nMy brother is a teacher and the first person in our family to graduate from university. I have always been proud of him and he is actually pretty awesome. He married another teacher and they have two boys. His wife comes from a family of educated people. I think most of her relatives are college educated.   \nMy wife and I are expecting our first child and we had my parents and my brother's family over so we could announce it. I spent the day getting my smoker going early and we set up for what I thought was going to be a nice visit and announcement.   \nFull disclosure, my wife and I currently live in a manufactured home (mobile home). We keep it tidy and it has city water and power.   \nI'm not sure why but my sister-in-law decided that before dinner was the perfect time to tell her children that they needed to stay in school if they didn't want to end up like me and my wife.   \nI saw red and was about to let her have it but my mom and brother told her that she was being rude and that she needed to apologize. She didn't. She doubled down and said that we were doing okay for the two of us but what if we wanted a child. She just didn't want her kids to end up like us.   \nI told my brother he needed to tell her to shut up or they needed to leave. She said that she was just thinking about our future and our children's future.   \nI told her then that my kids would probably be okay as soon as her husband paid me back for his education that I paid for. My brother has no student loans because I paid for his education. I told her that my current house wasn't great but that the construction across the road was our new house we were having built since my wife and I owned the quarter section of land our trailer is on. I then told her that since I make more money than her and my brother combined while only working a little over half a year I think we will be okay.   \nI would not actually call in the loan to my brother. I know that they are living just within their means and do not have the money to pay me back.   \nShe got embarrassed and they left. I told my parents about the baby and we had a shit tonne of left overs since four people left.   \nMy parents, my wife, and my brother all said that I didn't need to lose my cool with her and that she meant well. My mom said that I was vulgar to point out how much money I make. I don't know. I hated myself for pointing out that my brother is poor compared to me but I didn't start the conversation. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

SIL needed to be checked and humbled, maybe next time she won't be so snooty about people's careers next time.", "NTA. A lot of people with higher education (and I have PhD so I know when I say this) are oblivious how much money tradesmen make because of remarks like that. Truth is, you work very hard and you can push yourself to work as much as you need (and respectively take half a year off work if you want to) because your craft is needed on a daily basis for the function of our infrastructure, homes and society. \n\nIt is fine idea to try to educate your kids into trying to be more educated. However, it is extremely rude and ignorate to try and denigrade other person's work because of it. If there were no cleaners, we would be all living in filth. If there were no garbage collectors, there would be epidemic everywhere. Yet those jobs are usually used as an example of despicable thing to do and that is really denigrading and really doesn't teach kids to respect those people for their work. \n\nI think your SIL is one of those ignorant people. I had just started my PhD (25 years old at the time) when in a conversation with a friend (23 at the time) discovered he had actually quit school at 16, started apprenticeship with an electrician, learned all he could, by 21 he had license and his own clients and was making twice more at the time of our conversation than what I was doing while at the same time setting up his own hours (similarly to you) so he could make the budget he was aiming for and have time to travel, enjoy life, etc (this all in EU, not US). \n\nEducation is precious commodity and extremely valuable for our entire society, but in some countries (US) higher education can be extremely expensive investment that can take decades to pay back. It is important for young adults to realize that and to think about what their goal is. Not just use petty insults to drive them to education. \n\nP.S. And here I want to point out that being a tradesman doesn't mean you can't educate yourself further through adult education courses or night courses in college if you feel the need or want to do that - adults that want to learn something can be way more motivated and goal oriented than young adults that enter college just because \"that's what I am expected to do\".", "NTA.

I had a big scrape down my face and was bleeding a little bit. He grabbed a paper towel out of his truck and brought my dogs to me all the while speaking Spanish and barely passable English. They wanted to call an ambulance but after a couple of minutes, I convinced them that I was ok. They walked my dogs and me back to my house and made sure that I knew they'd call an ambulance if I needed them to. What a great group of caring men they were. I called their company and told them what happened and that these workers are what is right in the world. I now use them for my garbage pickup.", "THANK YOU!", "Encourage the garbage truck driving; they earn a higher hourly wage than teachers.", "It is funny that you say that because my dad was a teacher and I remember him getting angry at my sister because she decided dump the garbage man she was dating and marry a teacher.  Then again, he worked in a technical college and was used to seeing his \"blue collar\" students graduate from a two year program and start out making more money than he did with a master's and 30 years experience.", "You'd be surprised how many teachers go into teaching because they like being control freaks. Or because they like holding power over a captive audience who can't fight back. There are lots of good teachers out there who genuinely what to teach, enrich, and prepare their students to make it in the world. But especially with the lack of good pay, they sometimes get drowned out by the ones who get into it for the wrong reasons.", "Some people really shouldn\u2019t be teachers\u2026 I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that", "I love this", "This is 100% the answer!", "She thinks it's vulgar for Black Sheep to disclose that he paid for Golden Child's college and she is a loser mom. I hope GC pays for her nursing home on his teacher's salary and OP refuses to.", "I've heard that the most reliable indicator of intelligence is how much and how high level schooling a person has had. This narrative is pushed by academics; a group with emotional and economic reasons to embrace and spread this particular belief.\n\n\nI don't mean to denigrate education in any form but when a teacher is telling people through words or actions that other people are stupid because they didn't receive the same sort of education it is a problem. Some of the smartest people I know received extensive education, like my doctor growing up who was an allergist, a pediatrician, a general practitioner, and an ENT specialist. I think he was a pulmonologist too. Others like my Pop Pop didn't get a chance to do much college because he had to drop out to work to provide for his family but he learned his whole life one way or another and was smart as anything.", "That\u2019s such a lovely story!", "Or they like the schedule and don't understand how much work it is to really do the job well.", "Two of my kids went to NCSU.   And I am damn proud of them and the school.   She may change her mind when she sees the cost of tuition at private schools by the time her children get there.", "This. I've had students find out how much I made teaching, and then laugh and say they can make so much more than that welding or doing construction. And they have a valid point!\n\nI just told them teachers don't become teachers for the money.\n\nAnd that the world needs lots of plumbers and electricians and welders and construction workers and mechanics so find the job you will most enjoy that will support you in life. \n\nI really hate the push in education for the past few decades that all students should go to college. That is part of why the younger generation has crippling student loan debt.  Not everyone can or should go to college, and maybe some students should wait until after they have worked for a decade and matured first.", "I live in Canada and have a couple relatives who teach in the public school system, not even one of the boards that are highest paid... one is in her late 30's and has been teaching for a bit over 10 years. She pulls in over $90k a year with kick ass benefits and one of the best pensions around. That is a pretty average salary.\n\nAll this being said.....I find it ludicrous how much teachers in the US are paid by comparison.", "There's tons of smaller private universities that won't survive the next couple of decades anyway. The big names will be fine, but the smaller schools are already hurting for enrollment. There's just not as many HS grads to go around. The state schools will do okay mostly because of cost, the big name schools will do okay because of name recognition/reputation, but the smaller and mid-tier private schools are in trouble."]}
