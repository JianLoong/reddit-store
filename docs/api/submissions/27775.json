She's great and we have a good relationship. But, now I hate her casual man (CM).\n\nCM spends most of his time with his wife/children but has an open marriage and occasionally sees Ellie when he has time. I personally wouldn't want ethical non-monogamy, but if she's happy, ok.\n \nThey're aware of how I feel and that I'm generally not into alt/kinky stuff. I've also shared a few horror stories about Unicorn Hunters, especially the men.\n\nOn Saturday night we had dinner before Ellie/CM went out  and CF/I and I stayed in. We confirmed the sleeping arrangements several times and everyone was aware that CF had the room and I had the couch.\n\nAt dinner, Ellie made a joke at about pairing up \"sausages\" and \"buns\" - and I uncomfortably retorted that she could have them, I'd eat my own bun. My tone was semi-serious at first and I tried to lighten it up for the punchline. I refer to myself chronic masterbater anytime someone questions my relationship status (why risk disappointment, disease, pregnancy and murder when I can do it better myself?) I thought it was a, but I saw CM's face look... Offended? But he didn't say anything and we moved on. They went to the party and we went to bed early. \n\nAround 3:45am, they LOUDLY return. All the lights are on, they're speaking at full volume, going between rooms, etc. They are drunk, but not THAT drunk. Whatever. \n\nBut soon, I hear spanking and I get angry. I can tell that her door at the end of the hall, directly beside the ONLY bathroom, is open. I loudly roll over on the couch, swish my sleeping bag around and they seem to stop.\n\nAt 4:30am, I go to turn off lights and use the bathroom. The layout of the place is such that I can't see down the hallway until I'm in the hall but all the noise travels freely. So I know the bathroom is empty. I make some noise getting off the couch and then a TONNE of noise tipping over cat toys. \n\nI turn the corner and CM's posing completely naked in the hall with a big smile on his face. \n\nIn the moment, I assumed he was going to the bathroom, apologized and shut off the light. Once it was off, he immediately went back into Ellie's room. He did not say anything at any point, attempt to cover himself or stop smiling while the lights were on. He did not go into the bathroom later. Creepy. \n\nI retreated to the couch and CM went to the kitchen several times, still naked, still visible. I couldn't go back to sleep and waited almost an hour to go to the bathroom. I didn't want to risk literally running into him while he was naked, which is what I think he wanted.\n\nHe didn't apologize or make any mention of the incident to me or Ellie. She didn't even find out about it until I cooled off and messaged her a few days later. He was with her and apologized immediately. He said he felt \"really uncomfortable\" about it as an explanation. \n\nI despise this guy now and he's no longer welcome on the trip to my home.

It's not just you, but christ people are lazy and presumptuous that everyone will know these initialisms.\n\nEdit: I read a little bit and I don't think it's 'ethnic non minority'.

You knew the lifestyle Ellie and CM lead. You're staying in their space; don't like their lifestyle, don't stay over. You made snide comments during dinner, then get upset when they live their life in their own home? Plus, you were the one eavesdropping and stalking around the house making noise.

You explicitly stated that when they returned they were drunk, and a mere forty five minutes later you\u2019re acting like this guy was completely sober and in control of his faculties. Whilst posing naked is obviously a terrible idea, you\u2019re acting like he did this rationally and soberly. Terrible ideas always seem great when you\u2019re wasted. You\u2019re too far into your puritanical vanillaness to be somewhat fair to the situation.

Also this crowd doesn't seem like a great fit for you overall OP", "Not the asshole. But he AND your friend kind of both are, tbh. Both of them decided to leave that door open, both of them were disrespectful of you trying to sleep, and I get the strong impression that she definitely was game to let him *try* to get you on board at least, so she sure as hell wasn\u2019t sticking up for your boundaries.\n\nUninvite them both.

He was maybe looking to see if she was down the first time, but after that, he was getting off on her being uncomfortable. Everybody knows that unless it's been *explicitly* stated that it's ok, you don't go around naked in somebody else's house, you don't engage in sex acts with the door open, you basically keep your junk out of other people's faces. The fact that he knew she was sleeping in the living room and still walked past her naked to get to the kitchen is so completely out of line that I wouldn't accept any apologies from him either.\n\nETA: I only just realised that Ellie is CM's partner (I thought CM was with CF). So Ellie is letting her casual partner continuously expose himself to her friends? And she's having sex with the door open while she has guests around? I don't really trust Ellie either now.", "That's exactly what I think.

Once I saw him go into Ellie's room, I would've heard him leave again to go the bathroom. Like I did when he went to the kitchen. Besides that, he was being very loud otherwise, why would I think he'd suddenly start sneaking around? \n\nTo be clear, I think he was leaving the bathroom (which has tile flooring) when he heard me coming and decided to wait for me in the hall. That's the only thing that explains why he was standing perfectly still and his position in relation to the doorways. But mostly, it's because he didn't have to turn his head to look at me, he was already looking right where I would be standing.

It's her place, I've stayed with her before and she has never done anything like this because she knows I'm not comfortable with it.

Also, it's not snide to shut down sexual \"jokes\" when they make me uncomfortable, especially when I'm speaking to a friend.", "So if he had murdered her cat instead of exposing himself, would she be the AH for being upset? He's drunk after all and apparently can't be held responsible for his own behavior, right?", "Wifey's probably happy to have him being a sex pest far away from her.", "He's probably not so much into the ethical part of the acronym.
