Immediately. But I think you guys are going through some sort of power struggle. Coming from a person in a teen relationship. Me and my boyfriend argue a lot. We just have very strong personalities.

She just rationalizes that what she chose is better, so we\u2019re gonna go with that\u2026 it even sounds innocent, but pointing it out accomplishes nothing, because she believes it to be a discussion between us, then a compromise. I theorized maybe shaking my head \u201cyes\u201d in a conversation as simply an acknowledgment that she\u2019s speaking to me, might be misinterpreted as me agreeing or something. Does that sound possible?", "It sounds like she's asking for your opinion, decides she doesn't like it, and then goes with what she wants. Have you said \"hey wait, I said I was craving tacos. Why did you go with pizza?\" What does she say to that?", "Now that you've brought this to her attention, have you tried offering an opinion again? Like saying what you want for dinner when asked? You know, to see if what you've told her has had any impact.\n\nIf you've tried and you're getting the same result, why fight the tide?\n\nBut if you haven't tried, it may be worth an attempt. Making her aware of it may get a different response from her. She might actually agree with your choice. Sure, she might do it initally just to prove you wrong. But if she continues, she might actually start developing habits of compromise and make a real change.\n\nOne suggestion on a decision making method that may also help here. When asked what you want, like for dinner, instead of initially offering what you do want, list the things you're not in the mood for. (Its what my family often starts with). Then encourage her to provide a similar list.\n\nIf she's actually willing to compromise, you should be able to arrive at a mutually satisfactory choice from the narrowed down list.

Are you saying he should have left her over this? That's fucking bananas. Are you not aware that there are degrees of problems? She cheated on me = big problem. She killed my dog = big problem. She pushes for her way, even asking my preference = not so big problem. Maybe he just doesn't care enough to upend their lives over it. \n\nIf you threaten ultimatums or give up on relationships over every little discrepancy, you're going to end up miserable and alone, and deserve it.", "It sounds like he might also need to learn that they can express a preference as the start of a conversation, she doesn't have to just like his idea (and vice versa).
