She stopped calling after he refused to give her money. \n\nLast Tuesday my MIL called and asked my husband for 15 thousand dollars, she said she needed it for vacation. After he told her no, she sent me a lengthy text message saying that I had no right to get involved in a mother\u2019s relationship with her son, I didn\u2019t respond.

If she needed the money for a good reason she wouldn't have been lying about it.", "NTA. The other replies got this one covered. MIL is using her husband and son to liquidate funds to give a lavish lifestyle to her buddies? Your edit/update makes it even more obvious. You busted a gold-digging scammer, out of concern and love for your husband and his father. Oh no, you\u2019re the catalyst for someone to stop doing something they shouldn\u2019t, they faced consequences for their actions, and now they\u2019re big angy!

You fortunately exposed this scam, it could have been worse.", "NTA.  I love it how MIL blamed you when her own son is the one who told her \"No\" when she asked to borrow money.

She and her family then blamed you for telling her husband that she was asking for money, when again it was her *own* son.\n\n\"My son wouldn't do this to me!

That\u2019s when **my husband** told him about her calling us for money.!\n\nNTA, because YOU didn't tell FIL about it. All you did was voice concerns about MIL asking for vast amounts of money, which is TOTALLY your business.  \n\n\n>AITA for bringing it up to my FIL that my MIL is secretly harassing us for money?  \n\n\nRead that back slowly OP. You're asking if you're the bad person for mentioning a manipulative relationship and hostile messages you've received. **NO.**", "So the people calling you to call you TA were benefiting from her borrowed largesse. Nta, obviously", "NTA. Pay her friends rent? This smell like an affair from miles away, that or gambling problems, whatever it is clearly it not good for the marriage.", "NTA, the cash has gone to MILs relatives. Lol", "NTA. And good on you. My mom did this, borrowing money from everyone. Turns out she was way in debt and had a ton of credit cards my dad didnt know about. Your FIL deserved to know.", "NTA! Sounds like you exposed a fraud. \n\nShe needs to live with the consequences of her appalling behaviour and terrible judgement.", "NTA, I would have been pissed being the FIL. You didn\u2019t lie or gossip. You simply stated what was going on. Your MIL fault for thinking her lying wouldn\u2019t catch up to her. It looks like her extravagant lifestyle is coming to an end.", "It would be good if your FIL and her talk this out, maybe there\u2019s underlying control/power imbalance issues. \n\nGlad you didn\u2019t reveal anything truly terrible (gambling, an affair)\u2026but if the people she\u2019s caring for needed this, I\u2019d see an issue in her hiding a good deed (why?) and of course if it\u2019s overspending (again self-image/why?)\u2026\n\nNTA **given, your husband openly told with you.** You got lucky. In future, let your husband handle his family imho. It\u2019s good you two set boundaries together, but this could\u2019ve gone very badly had your husband not stepped in. You dodged one, be careful not to overstep. \n\nAlso considering had you not said anything maybe your husband could afford it and planned to all along. It\u2019s ok to give sometimes, and we don\u2019t need to be involved if it\u2019s not affecting anyone. I know this goes against this subs very individualistic take of obligation, but imho \u2018want to\u2019 is enough reason sometimes and doesn\u2019t require more justification. I never understood why anyone needs to justify kindness\u2026but that\u2019s my personal opinion.", "NTA,  your MIL constantly asking your husband for money affects you and your marriage.  \n\nThe FIL has a right to be informed.

It's better to rip the bandaid off now.", "NTA and if your MIL is asking for such large quantities of money you have every right to be concerned and raise it with her husband.

You did the right thing. MIL is just mad because she can't scam her husband and son anymore.", "NTA. It sounds like MIL has a drug or gambling addiction. I can't think of too many reasons someone would need large sums of money like that in cash on a semi regular basis.", "NTA - she's been lying to everybody! it's possible she needs serious help", "OK; so this is why you should have a job and not be stuck in a classic marriage where you have no income of your own so you do weird shit like this.\n\nNTA, your MIL did this herself, someone has to say something. \n\nGet modern, people!", "NTA  \n\n\nso the MIL has some jerk friends taking advantage of her.  and she has been a jerk in turn for hounding you and your husband for cash.", "NTA. You would have been a monster to rat her out for $20 of food money. $15,000 to squander and then lie about is insanity. \"Our secrets keep us sick\" and you just lanced one hell of a metaphorical boil.", "NTA. 15k is not some chump change. Your DH said no. She then nuked herself by sending you the text. That's on her.", "NTA. Let her fund her own fun.", "NTA. You have been paying others rent, buying others lavish gifts.

Good for him. \n\nOP, NTA", "Gambling addiction maybe?  That's a huge amount of money.", "exactly, op acted out of compassion asking if there was a problem.\n\nMIL, like most grifters, got greedy and the size of the problem is what caught her.", "This! \n\nNTA", "Seriously what the hell. If my mother started doing that, asking for cash specifically. One or 2 times okay but a habitual need of thousands of dollars?
