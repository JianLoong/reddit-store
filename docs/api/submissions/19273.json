If she needed the money for a good reason she wouldn't have been lying about it.", "NTA. The other replies got this one covered. MIL is using her husband and son to liquidate funds to give a lavish lifestyle to her buddies? Your edit/update makes it even more obvious. You busted a gold-digging scammer, out of concern and love for your husband and his father. Oh no, you\u2019re the catalyst for someone to stop doing something they shouldn\u2019t, they faced consequences for their actions, and now they\u2019re big angy!

You fortunately exposed this scam, it could have been worse.", "NTA.  I love it how MIL blamed you when her own son is the one who told her \"No\" when she asked to borrow money.  Some MILs seem to believe that the son they raised is incapable of thinking for themselves.  She and her family then blamed you for telling her husband that she was asking for money, when again it was her *own* son.\n\n\"My son wouldn't do this to me!  It must be his wife, despite what everyone else has said!\"  Your MIL sounds like a real winner.", "Lol NTA.
