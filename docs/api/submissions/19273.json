Then I read that she had also been withdrawing large amounts of money from their shared account and that FIL hadn't questioned it. She's obviously addicted to spending and isn't able to keep up with it on her own. $15,000 for a trip? What was she going to do once she borrowed that money and then obviously didn't take the trip? How did she expect that no one would ever catch on when she's saying things like she's paying for your wedding when she didn't?

Damn that\u2019s a lot of money to throw around.", "MIL is trash. NTA.", "NTA.   Your question to your FIL was entirely reasonable and your husband told his own father about the requests.   Obviously your FIL took it very seriously.  Your MIL is trying to turn this around on you because otherwise it would be obvious that she was lying to her husband about money.", "NTA.

You did good!", "NYA. It's totally fair that you get a say in how your spouse spends large sums of money. But nobody ever really knows what goes on in someone else's marriage.

Had she had been hiding money to escape an abusive marriage it might have been a dangerous secret to share.", "It's like when one partner cheats on the other and then blames whoever informed their partner that they are a lying cheater. \n\nShe straight up cheated on her husband and emotionally hurt him.

It is quite possible she's being taken advantage of by romance scammers or shitty IRL friends, or has some kind of substance abuse or gambling problem, so shutting that down can only be a good thing.", "Nta. I\u2019d like to go where all this money was going. His mother-in-law a drug addict or something?", "I'm confused why her son didn't find it odd FOR YEARS. I'd wonder if she had an addiction or was secretly funding and housing a lover or something that would make me ask wtf was going on.\n\nAnd then for her to lie to her husband about withdrawing the money to pay for their wedding!!!! How many other times has she done that! Weddings are expensive. That's just insane to me.\n\nWhat MIL doesn't understand is that as soon as the money is gone, those \"friends\" are gone too. They're not worth overturning your life like this. I have seen it happen in real life. Ridiculous.", "Looks like she's already planning the divorce lol. Taking as much money as possible", "Most definitely.", "I can be naive sometimes, but even I snorted and went \u201cyeah, right!\u201d when I read the update.

She was later surprised when her own son did this to her and blamed it all on the Dil poisoning her son. When the DiL didn't even care if her husband was hearing his fun money with her parents or not.", "There I kind of disagree with you.  The OP makes it clear her husband didn't really care and was willing to do it without questioning or pushing back because it wasn't a hard sum for him to come up with.  Was it a weird request?  Yes.  Would he have continued ponying up forever had his now-wife not made it an issue?  Maybe?  Probably?  But it is clear the no and the making it known to FIL was due to the wife's influence.  Is that a bad thing for the MIL?  Maybe?  Was it unjustified to reveal it?  That is really the question and there I would say it was totally justified to get this out in the open as it was not ok.", ">What MIL doesn't understand is that as soon as the money is gone, those \"friends\" are gone too.\n\nShe probably does which is why she kicked off so hard. No wonder she sounds like the kind of person who has to rent friends.", "Yeah - this would surely set off the \u201cso, which addiction is it?\u201d signals, I can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t even wonder what was going on with her. Hell, if it was a parent I was on good terms with, I\u2019d be starting with \u201care you okay, is your husband not covering your living expenses, is this financial abuse\u201d, even.", "Monster in law. I love that phrase.", "She just wants to play high roller, but her husband won't let her with their joint finances. Rich people culture is extremely weird once you're exposed to it. There's a pecking order and cliques and being in the in crowd is very important when you value those types of things, and that doesn't come free.", "Bingo", "NTA - this woman is a thief and deserves everything coming to her", "Especially given it seems like FIL was being taken for a bit of a ride along with OP\u2019s husband a bit.\n\nI guess now they\u2019ve picked their side - and it\u2019s the side with  all the money hahaha", "I thought she was building a nest egg, because she was planning to leave her husband.

Still it was a good movie, overall.", "Ironically enough, this is the one time I believe her.\n\nBuying expensive gifts for friends and paying for their bills sounds exactly like the kind of thing a narcissistic MIL would do. She gets her high from feeling superior/good about helping others.", "True. And why the relatives are so upset.  Their money train got cut off.\n\nMaybe a combo?", "Bingo! I worked for a **Benevolent Narcissist** for quite awhile. I\u2019d had so much narc experience at that point, I was just glad it was a branch that I could use in us worker bees\u2019 favor. So we fed his narc supply needs & he continued to be benevolent to get more of his supply. Win win when you can keep distance from the narc. Ofc his money was his/ his company\u2019s, not money he was fleecing from his kids.", "Or she's fallen for a Nigerian romance scammer.", "Maybe, or maybe there are no \"friends\" because the relatives that are upset are the \"friends\" who's money train got cut off.", "I always find it funny that the group of people who feel superior to others and pride themselves on being manipulative are also the most predictable mother fuckers on the planet.
