My immediate family disregarded the outfit, and then told me I \"made it about myself.\"", "selftext": "This past weekend was a wedding for my cousin who was aware of what I was wearing.\n\nA bit more context: my family is *extremely* gendered. Constantly commenting on the differences between men and women and acting like that's the only reasons people make the decisions they do. My father used to tell me to look at my nails certain ways, not to hold my hands in certain positions, and even once said \"just go put on your skirt.\" My mother, when I came out to her at 13 said \"just please tell me you don't want to wear women's clothing.\"\n\nAnyways, I wore the skirt and it was a big deal for me so I felt a bit anxious and probably led to me coming off a bit \"aggressive\" to some people I spoke to. \n\nFor the most part people didn't really care. But my immediate family acted like there was *nothing* to discuss. My brother in law walked in to my hotel room as I was getting ready and I don't think even registered what I was wearing (this is before anyone really saw) and I made a comment to my sister (his wife) that it was funny he didn't notice. (I would later be told that this was me looking for a reaction and picking a fight.) \n\nThere was a woman at the wedding that mistaked me for a waiter and we had a funny interaction. When I went to (excitedly) tell my mom the funny story (which everyone at the table that woman was at was laughing about it, re-telling the story, and took a picture with me). My mom ignored the funny part and said \"Okay. It's not a big deal.\" (I never thought it was). \n\nMy grandmother gave me a really sweet compliment and pulled me aside and said \"when you told me what you wanted to wear I thought you were crazy but seeing it all together it's really good looking. I love it!\" \n\nI was later walking arm and arm with my mom and told her what my grandmother said and she responded with \"Well it's a wedding everyone looks nice.\" And I said \"you clearly have an inability to tell me you like what I'm wearing.\" And walked away. \n\nMy sister just called me on the phone under the guise of asking \"if there was something wrong based on how angry I was this weekend\" and some of the highlights of the conversation included telling me I made the wedding about myself. \n\nEventually *I ended up apologizing for my behavior*. \n\nAll I wanted was a bit more *support* from my family rather than a complete ignoring of what was happening. \n\nAITA?!", "created_utc": 1687201861, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dnn86/aita_i_gay_30_male_wore_a_long_black_pleaded/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were amongst people you knew so of course people would be aware of you. You could leave an impression and hold attention by being outstanding without drawing attention by standing out.\n5) wearing a skirt was a big deal for you so you should have been able to understand what a big deal this was for the people getting married (if nothing else for their outfits being in a category of their own)\n\nWell, at least you didn't wear white.", "YTA, I\u2019m missing the part where anyone had a go at you for wearing a skirt ?

It seems like you wanted a big response, but someone\u2019s wedding isn\u2019t the time for that. \n\nIf someone actively felt they had to call you because of how angry you were, even though no one said anything negative about your outfit, I think that speaks volumes about how you may have been behaving at this wedding. It\u2019s not the time, nor the place. \n\nIt\u2019s great that you wore what you wanted to wear, but why did you need a big response? You were there to celebrate someone\u2019s wedding.", "This is hilarious, you 100% wore what you wore to create drama and make it all about you AT SOMEONE ELSE'S WEDDING, and now are throwing a mini tantrum because they saw through your bullshit and wouldn't feed into it and treated you well.

Troll your friends or whatever instead.", "YTA.  You did make it all about you. So you're gay. Big deal.\n\nYou're the one who kept trying to get everyone to talk about your outfit.

Not cool. \n\nReevaluate and stick to that apology instead of looking for validation for your bad attitude here.", "I\u2019m not sure what you wanted here.

Constantly commenting on the differences between men and women and acting like that's the only reasons people make the decisions they do. My father used to tell me to look at my nails certain ways, not to hold my hands in certain positions, and even once said \"just go put on your skirt.\" My mother, when I came out to her at 13 said \"just please tell me you don't want to wear women's clothing.\"\n\nAnyways, I wore the skirt and it was a big deal for me so I felt a bit anxious and probably led to me coming off a bit \"aggressive\" to some people I spoke to. \n\nFor the most part people didn't really care. But my immediate family acted like there was *nothing* to discuss. My brother in law walked in to my hotel room as I was getting ready and I don't think even registered what I was wearing (this is before anyone really saw) and I made a comment to my sister (his wife) that it was funny he didn't notice. (I would later be told that this was me looking for a reaction and picking a fight.) \n\nThere was a woman at the wedding that mistaked me for a waiter and we had a funny interaction. When I went to (excitedly) tell my mom the funny story (which everyone at the table that woman was at was laughing about it, re-telling the story, and took a picture with me). My mom ignored the funny part and said \"Okay. It's not a big deal.\" (I never thought it was). \n\nMy grandmother gave me a really sweet compliment and pulled me aside and said \"when you told me what you wanted to wear I thought you were crazy but seeing it all together it's really good looking. I love it!\" \n\nI was later walking arm and arm with my mom and told her what my grandmother said and she responded with \"Well it's a wedding everyone looks nice.\" And I said \"you clearly have an inability to tell me you like what I'm wearing.\" And walked away. \n\nMy sister just called me on the phone under the guise of asking \"if there was something wrong based on how angry I was this weekend\" and some of the highlights of the conversation included telling me I made the wedding about myself. \n\nEventually *I ended up apologizing for my behavior*. \n\nAll I wanted was a bit more *support* from my family rather than a complete ignoring of what was happening. \n\nAITA?!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
