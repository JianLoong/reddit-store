She has very likely been lying to you about the money. Also, lock your credit down, it's easy to do & easy to unlock when you need to get a loan or credit card & then lock it again.", "Honestly the most concerning part is the identity theft. That alone makes her ta. You should ask advice in r/legal advice if it\u2019s worth the trouble but you would not be the asshole", "YTA- it\u2019s not your money- never has been. It\u2019s your mothers money- she can use. However- your mother is also an AH.", "You'd need to run this by a lawyer to see what the laws are and how to maneuver them.", "Check the arrangement with a lawyer first and let the lawyer advise you. NTA.", "You can hire an attorney but there is no will. So, all she has to say is no, and you get nothing.  I think you\u2019ll end up with a lot of legal fees and not the result you want.", "NTA, but if you're in the US, the college fund legally belongs to the parents who are contributing, not the child (if it's a 529 fund).  The parent who uses it for not-school expenses ends up paying the extra taxes on it upon withdrawal.\n\nAnd unless your grandparent(s) had a will that identifies you as a beneficiary, you get what you get from your mother, regardless of the grandparent(s) \"wishes\" that they neglected to put into a legal document.", "Better yet, hire an actual lawyer.  As it stands it's way too easy for mom to steal money and she has demonstrated she'll actually break the law to do it.  Get her stopped YESTERDAY!", "I know, spoiled 1st world problems.", "Check your credit scores with all three credit ratings firms. Look everything over carefully to see if there are credit cards or loans that you don't recognize. These need to be investigated ASAP. \n\nCredit fraud is a serious crime. So is identity theft. She should be reported and face the consequences.\n\nI'm sorry for the way your mother has treated you.", "YTA. Your college fund was her money to use (heck you didn't even go to college). Also, no will means that any money she has given to you from any of her inheritance is because she has wanted to give it. She should really cut you off....geez.", "Here's your problem - that's her money NOT yours. You quit school and she dissolved the fund. And her inheritance is not yours. You're an adult.

That only prevents a single parent from draining the whole fund for personal use but not their half.", "It\u2019s not the parent\u2019s responsibility to pay for your college even with good intentions to save for it.

Good luck.", "I think you are wise to get a lawyer and a bullet proof agreement.\n\nHowever, what accountability is there?\n\nYour mother took your college fund, which you state was yours in the divorce decree.

Including, stealing mine and my grandparents (now deceased) debit/credit cards, checking books and just go on wild sending spree\u2019s because she just felt entitled to the money.   When I say the financial abuse was wild, I mean it was WILD. Hundred of thousands were taken from my grandparents just as I was growing up, to me personally I know she took probably $125-150k from me as well.

OP, despite the brilliant opinions of Reddit\u2019s self-proclaimed lawyers, from your description, you likely have no money in your mother\u2019s possession, everything is about her good will that you will destroy, following these shitty pieces of advice. Be careful and not TA to yourself."]}
