I understand your position but it boils down to, you are hired by company 'x' and you are going home with 'x's product that was to be placed in the bin.  \n\nThe company has the right to decide on protocol for expired food.

However, your employer would be well within their right to fire you. It is in fact theft, and is typically referred to as \"grazing\".\n\n\nThese policies are put in place to combat employees who might relabel food as expired when it isn't, or over produce food they know won't sell in time, with the intention of taking it home.\n\n\nWhether you agree with it or not, taking product that is the property of your employer without payment or permission, is theft.

Not being an asshole wouldn\u2019t protect you from being fired, but I\u2019m sure you already know that.\n\nSide note, charities and food banks probably can\u2019t accept them if the label says they\u2019re expired, so that\u2019s probably why your employer doesn\u2019t donate them.", "Morally NTA.  However, you should start a campaign to donate that food to local food pantries.  \n\nIf they say the Bs of 'someone could sue!'

Personally I think breaking a rule that benefits no one and is extremely wasteful  as well doesn't make you an AH.  It's pretty disgusting that so many stores will just throw out anything they can't sell imo.  That won't prevent any consequences if you get caught though, so I'd be careful if I were you.

You are stealing from your employer.  You are a THIEF.\n\nThat \"sell by\" date is there to protect your employer (and your JOB by extension) from liability if someone gets sick eating expired food. \n\nWhat do you do with all the food you steal?  Do you eat it yourself or give it away?  If the former, then it's your own health you're risking. But if you're giving it to other people, you are playing roulette with THEIR health and well-being.

My local grocery store chain brings around the uneaten prepared foods at the end of the day and offers it to employees, precisely to avoid this food waste. Plus the employees feel more cared for which helps their morale. Throwing away the food at the end of the day like your store does is wasteful and helps no one, even the store. It\u2019s a disgusting practice when there are so many people that go hungry and employees like you will be resentful which affects performance.", "For a situation like this, it is important to separate the moral and legal. Legally what you are doing is theft. You can be fired if caught. Morally I'll go with NTA, but just barely. This is assuming that you aren't relabeling things that aren't expired or taking them while they can still be sold. I say just barely because there are better places for that food to go than to you. One last point, people calling the other employee a snitch or a rat can piss off. OP may not be the a-hole morally but he has nobody to blame but himself if he gets caught.

If so, they will have the forms/talking points for you.  It\u2019s amazing to see the circle that cuts down on waste while also drastically improving the lives of people dealing with food insecurity.  For example, I will pick up fresh produce that doesn\u2019t sell from a farmer\u2019s market, it goes to the pantry where they either use it to make the hot food they serve daily or it goes in the pantry for people to take.  If no one takes it, it\u2019s then donated to a local farmer who uses it to feed his livestock.  Or I pick up trays of hot food from a retirement community dining room that they didn\u2019t use and we package it up for people to take from the open 24 hour commercial fridge outside the facility.

Like sure, those rules have a \"purpose\" but how sad is it that we live in a world where corporations would rather throw away mountains of food than \"risk\" an employee wasting a tiny bit of the corporate overlords billions of dollars to make extra food to take home.

Those containers can be notoriously easy to open, and when I worked grocery, our food pantry would not take anything open.

Our partner picked up once a week.)  until consumption as well.", "My daughter recently set this up at a store where she works. It took a bit to get the ball rolling but now the local food bank gets the food with a weekly pickup from the store.\n\n(Note most food banks cannot give out food with expired dates.
