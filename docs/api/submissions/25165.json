You gave him your answer along with an explanation. Now he\u2019s badgering you and using peer pressure to get you to bend to his will. In an ideal world, you would have kept your cool, but it\u2019s easy to understand your frustration.", "NTA, sounds like he wants to bring you to Jesus so you can be grateful and eventually bang him.", "NTA. Simply put, this is harassment. Even after you put yourself through the pain of explaining why, he has persisted. Too many people think they can hide behind the \u2018morality\u2019 of the church to get away with this sort of behaviour. Going to church does not make you a good person. He has an unhealthy interest in you and you are fully justified in blocking him and cutting him out of your life. \n\nNormally I\u2019d say screaming at someone in the street is never justified and I\u2019m not sure it is here. That said, you were pushed to breaking point by someone harassing you for months so I think you can be forgiven for that.", "NTA for blocking him. You've told him multiple times you didn't want to attend his church and he keeps badgering you about it.  I would've done the same thing. I'm not religious and have no interest in stepping foot in a church unless it's for a wedding or a funeral. If someone was persistent like your friend, I would avoid him like the plague", "Nta. I dump prosletyzers", ">Also when I went home I did fill out a load of his details to various website with his phone number with a call option ticked on all as a bit of petty revenge.\n\nThis seems like an appropriate amount of petty. It's proportionate to his relentless harassment. I have no comments.  Well played, OP.\n\nSeriously, though, many of us have been in similar situations, and it's frustrating that our boundaries are not respected. You didn't insult his religion. You just said, \"No.\"  Side note, I hope some of those websites were political because political robodials are never-ending and relentless. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe can take his sermons elsewhere. You told him no", "NTA.  No is a complete sentence.", "How the fuck is going to church fun? Listening to some out of touch old dude read from a book full of plot holes and then pass around a basket to beg money off people? Not my idea of fun at all", "NTA first of all you don't go to church for 'fun', church isn't a park or a video game room. Then his behavior is so inappropriate.", "ESH, ur friend for obvious reasons, and I was 100% on ur side until the revenge part, don't disclosure others personal information", "YTA for toxic friendship group bullshit and the petty stunt you pulled.\n\nAlso 28 is too old to be screaming in the street. Get help.\n\nYou do not have to be friends with someone if you do not want to be but don't be an ass.", "ESH \n\nNot because you blocked him but because you screamed at dude in the street and then still felt the need to get revenge \n\nHim for constantly pushing boundaries \n\nYour friends for supporting the boundary pushing", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My only fun memories around church growing up is proberly when I got in silly trouble eg\n\nHaving the police called when my hiding spot in hide and swek was a bit to good\n\nBeing kicked out of Christian camp for many reason but the number one play the explicit version of killing in the name of at fill volume so the who camp could hear \ud83e\udd23\n\nOrdering domino's when I didn't like the food they where giving (did hand out slices to people as well)", "Esh? And tbh I do feel really bad about it but can't take it back did put in my back up email address so going to be spammed a lot with that as well.", "This was after being repeatly asked and all I screamed was by do you keep on asking I've said no.\n\nWith the group chat he hasn't cheaked it in over a year as no longer really uses fb and messenger. It's manly where we just send memes to each other.\n\nAnd I've only blocked him while I cool down didn't say I didn't want to me his friend it's the constant nagging for 7 months.", "I don't agree with the screaming but if you were basically harassed by one of your friends who would not listen to you for months because they thought they knew better, would you not get annoyed? And if they wont listen to polite them firm No's, is it not understandable that the frustration would erupt?\n\nId say the blocking should have happened instead of the screaming but I'm going NTA as they were trying to trample over OP's boundaries. If this was him repeatedly asking for sex it would be sexual harassment. This is just a different type of harassment, that some people think is ok because religion gets a pass for some behaviours.", "Tbh this was being asked constantly being asked. He did ask the other people how where out with us but left it once they said no, but with me keeps on asking. All I screamed was WHY DO YOU KEEP ON ASKING I ALL READY SAID NO. it wasn't till be asked a further 2 times that I stormed off.\n\nI wish I could take back given out his phone number but I can't \ud83d\ude12.", "Yea this all sounds like \u201clook how stable and well adjusted I am now, all I needed was Jesus to complete me now all I need is you\u201d. \n\nHe never got over you and this is a stupid ploy to win you back. The fact you are the only one he\u2019s bugging to go to church with him is a dead giveaway.", "How does he feel about Star Wars? (In particular, [Chewbacca\u2026](https://youtu.be/O7_YuBHoNdg) )", "People spam calling him is the least of the problems with filling out a lot forms with his info. The real problem is that these are the type of info that scammers regularly use to ,well, scam people. I know what he was doing is annoying as hell and confronting and blocking him was the right thing to do, but there was no need to get revenge.", "I would admit at round about the 3 month mark I made this exact point to him about SA to get him to stop asking, but his words was he is not doing anything wrong just asking why I won't turn up. It's mainly when we are out together he ask and makes a point of stopping by mine before he goes to church to ask \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I have wondering this as well. But I think it's because I'm a key part in his support group, my friends only deal with him because I kept on inviting him out.

Do you know what denomination of Christian faith he\u2019s joined into (Baptist, Anglican, prez, Pentecostal, etc..)? Some are worse than others for proselytizing. A lot of new Christians also get filled with that holy vigor where they think it\u2019s their holy duty to bring everyone to the faith so that could also be behind his insistence but your history together makes me think he has an different motive.", "In case you didn\u2019t watch the video: Woman breaks up with boyfriend.

Will admit since I have meet him he was gone from religion to religion (budest, jewdism and a few others) so it at the begging think it was another faze.\nI draw the line however when he started to tell me that the paper I am writing for my dissertation is wrong because I'm writing about the Greeks gods and would the power structure have changed in modern day times and who would we worship.", "Shit yes I remember that \ud83e\udd23 tbh doing something like that did cross my mind \ud83e\udd23\n\nIt is a running joke with my friends that if you piss me of I have warned them I would do something like this", "New christians are usually super annoying about their new found faith regardless of denomination. If his track record is accurate then he will likely tire of this one too. You are not wrong on standing your ground on this one and are fully entitled to an apology if you even want to involve yourself with him anymore. There\u2019s no rule saying the friends you have need to stay your friends. If you gain nothing from this friendship and it\u2019s is mentally taxing then don\u2019t maintain it. Fuck what everyone else thinks, you are your own person.\n\nI also missed the paragraph at the bottom and that\u2019s actually hilarious.
