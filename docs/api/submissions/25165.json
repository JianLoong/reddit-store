Simply put, this is harassment. Even after you put yourself through the pain of explaining why, he has persisted. Too many people think they can hide behind the \u2018morality\u2019 of the church to get away with this sort of behaviour. Going to church does not make you a good person. He has an unhealthy interest in you and you are fully justified in blocking him and cutting him out of your life. \n\nNormally I\u2019d say screaming at someone in the street is never justified and I\u2019m not sure it is here.

You've told him multiple times you didn't want to attend his church and he keeps badgering you about it.  I would've done the same thing.

It's proportionate to his relentless harassment. I have no comments.  Well played, OP.\n\nSeriously, though, many of us have been in similar situations, and it's frustrating that our boundaries are not respected. You didn't insult his religion. You just said, \"No.\"  Side note, I hope some of those websites were political because political robodials are never-ending and relentless. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe can take his sermons elsewhere.

And if they wont listen to polite them firm No's, is it not understandable that the frustration would erupt?\n\nId say the blocking should have happened instead of the screaming but I'm going NTA as they were trying to trample over OP's boundaries. If this was him repeatedly asking for sex it would be sexual harassment. This is just a different type of harassment, that some people think is ok because religion gets a pass for some behaviours.", "Tbh this was being asked constantly being asked.

Ask them 'why not' 30 times until they gave in out of pity and frustration?\"\n\n> This coursed me to scream at him in the middle of the street & storm off. \n\n* That reaction isn't your fault entirely - he keeps pushing and pushing. honestly, IN MY OPINION - being a former Christian myself  I would cut contact.

Would he take the no to mean no?**\n\n>  Since then I have blocked him & removed him from the group chat. Have told friends I won't attend anything where he will be in attendance.\n\n* Good. Can you answer something for me? Do you know if he follows the 'alpha male' messages from Tate and others? I have a thought.\n\n * Hypothetically, lets say this friend has a massive crush on you - whether right now, or historically - it *may* be that his running to Christianity, and trying to get you to come - is an attempt to court you? He may be trying to get you to convert so he can ask you out without worrying about your non-belief?\n\n> Half the friendship group agree with me but the other half say I am being to harsh.\n\nHalf of your friends are on your side, **the other half want you to give in to him** after saying no so many times already.
