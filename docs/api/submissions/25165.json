He reached out when he was in hospital to apologise for things that I hadn't thought about in ages.\n\nBefore all of this I did tell him and his family I won't be able to support him as much as have a full time job whilst do my final year with my degree (part time) this always means I will have less time to spend with friends, but ya know price of living has gone up and a girls gotta eat.", "created_utc": 1692615438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15x4at5/aita_for_blocking_my_mate_after_they_keep_on/", "score": 1020, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Another thing my mom and her husband like to say a prayer before going on trips, and with respect, I hold hands with them, but it's not something that I believe in.

You\u2019re inadvertently letting him emotionally blackmail you into staying in your life without him even having to try, despite the fact that he\u2019s treating you badly.  He\u2019s not pushing your boundaries, he\u2019s trying to attack them with a sledgehammer. No wonder he doesn\u2019t have many friends.  That behavior is completely inappropriate and deserves to have consequences.", ">Also when I went home I did fill out a load of his details to various website with his phone number with a call option ticked on all as a bit of petty revenge.\n\nHilarious. Y.TA for that, but hilarious.\n\nNTA for everything else. No is a full sentence, you do not need to justify once, let alone *everytime he asks*. He needs to accept and move on, and since he isn't, you have moved on without him.", "Religious people exhaust me.\n\nWhy would you keep this person in your life?", "He's harassing you in a way that makes me think he may need more time in hospital. Tell all your friends he was repeatedly harassing you and any of them that say you're AH are enabling harassment and creepy male behaviour.\n\nNTA", "'Sall good, Mate \ud83d\ude1c", "NTA.

They hope to poke holes in your resolve and eventually turn you to their way of thinking and getting what they want.  It sounds like you have already built up your defenses.  \"NO\" is a complete sentence.  It requires no explanation.  Keep up your defenses.

Also, tell his family that you can no longer support him emotionally or financially since he needs far more help than a nonprofessional can provide.  Then cut off contact with the family.  Let friends know you won't be joining them for group activities if he is included and then cut off the ones who won't respect your boundaries.  I repeat you are neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist and you are not really qualified to deal with his psychiatric illness.  I made that mistake once and never will again.  Focus on your academics and earning money.
