I understand that's a bit of an awkward time for my wife to get them there when her workplace is very close to the school, but that's just life things.\n\nBefore the kids broke up for the holidays, I got an email off the school's principal explaining that our kids have been consistently late for school over the past few weeks and that it has sparked a lot of concern. \n\nI knew that the kids had been late a few times as they mentioned it to me, but I had no idea it was everyday.

She thought it was funny and said that it's not a big deal if our kids are 30-40 minutes late to school, and it's not like they're in high school yet.

She said school shouldn't start so early and that she's getting them to school so what's the big deal. \n\nI told her to stop being lazy and leave the house earlier in the morning and grow up.

Well my dad never picked us up until 2 hours after school finished, So the detention didn't really matter to us. \n\n Anyway about 6 months or so into the year the principal gotten involved and asked us what we were doing and why were late.  He mainly got involved because he saw me and my brother sit out front for 2 hours on the one day we didn't come late. \n\nMy dad called and explained the situation and the principal said that we were gonna get worse punishment and my dad said that he didn't care because he doesn't pick us up right away anyway. \n\nAnd after the principal gave us passes saying our situation was different than actually being late and signed us out of late detention for the rest of the time my dad was at that job.", "she is teaching them that punctuality does not matter, and unfortunately ( I am not a naturally punctual person by nature) it does, quite a lot actually.

While all grade levels are important, the 1st three years are crucial in making sure that they learn to read and write, which is a critical skill for success in the later grades.

Why not take a nap in the car after dropping off the children?", "I'm not sure how it is in your area or OPs area, but the schools here have \"count days.\" This is where the school's funding comes from. They have to report to the state how many kids are attending school on that particular day. It's been explained to me that if a child is absent when the count is taken, they lose some of their funding... however, they can count a kid if the kid was present on a different day that week (if count day is missed by the student). If a kid is late and missed the count, that child does not count. If the child is late all week that week and missed attendance throughout the week, the child can not be counted. This is just a basic explanation of the rules as it was explained to me. \n\nMy kids' school sends out emails and automated calls to each parent the week before the count day and the day before the count day as a reminder. When I was undergoing medical treatments a few years ago, I got a call to make sure all my kids would be in school on count day (my kids weren't absent during treatment but there were times when I had a really difficult time getting up and driving them to school so they were late approx 2 to 3x a month) from the superintendent. Not to berate me for them being late sometimes, but to ask if I would need help getting them to school on time for the week so that they could all be counted and they could get the appropriate funding.\n\nAnyhow,  long story short, if her kids' school has count days and the kids aren't able to be counted.. the principal may be inclined to report the kids/parents to whatever truancy/cps agency that is in their area, especially seeing as how the principal has already tried to address the problem. \n\nAlso, how rude is it that OPs wife is interrupting every other single students learning process by taking her kids to school late! And interrupting teachers doing their jobs! For no darn reason other than being lazy. I felt bad when I sent my kids to school late, and I had a medical reason. What she is doing is very selfish. I'm sure it's embarrassing to OPs kids also. I know my kids hated being late for class and walking into the room with everyone watching.

By 7, they were able to get themselves ready for school and out the door on time without adult intervention. One of us was home to help out if needed, but it certainly made the mornings easier.", "Ok, you are definitely NTA. I understand your concern for your kid's education, but, this might sound silly, your wife has a point. And it doesn't excuse her dropping the kids late but schools should not start this early as not everyone is a morning bird, eg. your wife. And you mention, your kids are 6. Missing the first 30-40 minutes of first grade doesn't seem that bad but it is not good that it happens everyday. You could probably approach your wife and calmly explain it to her that she should try to drop them on time for one day. Slowly, she would get the habit. She would have to. Explain the consequences and the involvement of a truant officer. As you wake up early, you could tell her how to get into the habit.", "As a teacher this type of behaviour infuriates me .We work so hard to make accommodations and work arounds for student who can't get to school on time due a multitude of reasons beyond the parents control, so when someone is 40 mins late ON PURPOSE because it's inconvenient to be on time, it is a slap in the face.  In most schools in many/most countries the first 2 hour block of the day is often the most important. ESPECIALLY at your children's age. That is often the literacy block ( in which reading, writing, phonics, spelling, handwriting, speaking and listening take place) and the first 40 mins can be vital, hell even the first 20 mins one could agree. I have taught 1.5/2 lessons in my first 40 mins each day with 6-8 year olds. It is where many schools will do their 5-10 mins 1:1 morning reading with an adult, go over the day's schedule, introduce vocal words of the day/ spelling focus, introduce the Big Book/story book that the rest of the lesson. When they come consistently in late they cannot follow the flow of the classroom and have missed the orientation of how to do many activities.  \"*time to go into your writer's work shop groups and do the 3rd activity, everyone, oh twins you don't know which group your in because you weren't here on time Monday or yesterday to know what group you're in and you missed the book we read that this activity was about so you have no idea what's going on and I'll have to take time I had blocked for other student's needs to catch you up*?\"   \n\n\n All that stuff that many parents think is just start of the day morning 'fluff' is actually cross curriculum integration that is sooooo important for young developing minds. In the first 15 mins all of my students have changed their readers and had an adult hear them read their book, we have marked the roll/register which I ask them to name an emotion on our chart how they are feeling for the day (happy, excited, tired, calm, sad, worried etc) so I can gauge where they're at for the day and they can learn to recognise their own emotions and understand others may not be on the same emotional wave length as them. We go over the lesson schedule for the day so they don't get anxious when they find out they have art or PE or maths after lunch or who has show and tell that day. We look at the date on the calendar and change the day of the week and the weather (Although it is the literacy block, time/dates/days/seasons comes under maths but as the curriculum is so over stuffed I only have 2 weeks to explicitly teach it, so I bring it in 2 mins every day so it is reenforced in this time instead) We review our phonics/spelling focus of the week and brainstorm words that contain these sounds. I read our focus book for the week.  Even me reading a book to 6 year olds who can barely read/can;t read yet they are seeing me model the correct way to open a book, that the title contain capital letters, what the difference between and author and illustrator is, and we recognise this author from a book we've read before, \"this book has rhyming words in it, can you be a rhyming detective and put your hand up when you hear/see  them? Oh well done, the words *sing* and *thing* are both rhyming words and contain the *ng* digraph which is this weeks spelling focus.\" All this in a quarter of an hour give or take. \n\nSorry for the rant but its my job to have these convos with parents and people like your wife just don't get it. I'll leave with the link to this poster to every day count, in which if kids miss just half an hour every day that equals the same as missing 1 and a half YEARS of schooling at the end of their school careers.
