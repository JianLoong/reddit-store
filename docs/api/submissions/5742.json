I suppose it probably was easier for me because I'm naturally an early bird, my brain won't let me sleep past 6am even on weekends.\n\nIf you think I'm the AH because I'm not being sympathetic I respect that opinion though, I just wanted to express my pov.", "I've been 3 hours early to work for a few months before. It sucks but you gotta do what you gotta do.", "My concern.. (I worked for a district a lifetime ago) is the repeated behaviour.. and I am thinking the principal will probably point this out too... is that if it keeps happening it will force their hands to call the authorities \n\nAnd depending where you live.. esp. In a conservative area.. I can see this spiraling into a nightmare that could easily be prevented. \n\nOther idea I just had..  my parents had similar issues when I was younger (and a younger sibling). I know my dad would drop us off and have a couple of hours before he had shift (cop). What did he do? Sometimes he would drive to work and take a power nap in the car. Sometimes he would run some errands so he would do it after work. Sometimes.. hell... he would go to the bookstore and wander around because that was one of his \"me\" things \nMaybe spin it to her that is an hour she has (and change) between drop off and work that she literally could do anything she wants.

It's not an equivalent burden to you doing it since you are a morning person.\n\nAgain, having said that, she is definitely an AH for just literally blowing off school start times which impacts your kids, their teacher, and their class. Thats why I went mid with ESH, but really just because what she is supposed to do seems easy to you and it isn't for everyone. That doesn't mean her response is at all ok though. \n\nPublic schools can also file child welfare reports with enough absences and late attendances, especially if a parent is not taking it seriously. So she definitely needs to understand that this is no joke, and has to stop.", "I completely agree, the wife is in the wrong here. 1000%.

I honestly thought you\u2019d say that they\u2019re 10 minutes late because your wife was struggling to get them going. My kids are sometimes 5 minutes late because there are days it\u2019s a battle to get all three in the car but it\u2019s never done on purpose and I get them to school asap. I\u2019d be livid if my husband was doing this.", "NTA. I was thinking 5 minutes late, not 40 minutes. That's a lot.

I work too and have to drop my son off to daycare before I have to go to work and wake up at 5:30 am sometimes. If I have time to kill before work I just do some quick errands before. Like go to post office, store etc. It's also great time to work out before work like near gym or walk near park. I'm a night owl and had to adjust and of course I'd rather sleep in but this is unexcuseable. Your wife really is putting them at a disadvantage taking them in late. I had a friend where her mom would drop her off late every morning and wouldn't care. I'll also add my friend also didn't wanna wake up early for bus hence why mom drove her late. My friend's mom really failed her daughter because that friend did really poorly in school and failed multiple classes.

Your relationship? Is she in therapy?", "NTA. Expect to end up in truancy court if this doesn\u2019t stop.", "NTA.

She stopped having a choice in all this when she had kids.\n\n\"She said school shouldn't start so early\"\n\nThis is the kind of thing which would make me question her IQ to be honest. She's lazy, so that means schools start too early. OK.", "OP, you're right, but so is your wife. The whole thing is a joke. Your kids aren't going to suffer in life because they were late to coloring giraffes. As a society, we lean on public school, because we won't fund public daycare. I entirely sympathize with your wife's point of view. However, it is true the school can make like difficult for you. People expect stuff. And at some point, your kids are going to have to come face to face with the bullshit expectations of our overworked, undersleeping, child-hating, guilt-driven, clock-enslaved society. So, you two need to come together and have a conversation. This is not about you being uptight and her being lazy, or you being conscientious and her being jaded and realistic. None of that. This is a practical problem-solving issue. Maybe you can get her to agree to be on time, as a favor to your piece of mind, and maybe convince her you two don't want to get angry messages from the school. Maybe you can change your schedule if you care so much about it. Who knows. But I think you need to wake up and realize who you are married to, and so does she. \n\nNAH, just figure this out, okay?", "Nta.  My situation was a little different But I was the kid in the situation.  Me and my brother were in middle school roughly 9 to 13 years. \n\nNow my dad's work required him to do something and he had about an hour to get to his work. \n\nHe's tried dropping us off early but hes not allowed to be early to work so it's waiting in the parking lot.  From how the layout was set up he could either drop us off late and arrive at work on time or  He could drop us early and get in trouble. (It's weird but his manager's were massive power trips)\n\n So consistently for a year we were dropped off late.  Actual policy was if you were late you got increasing detention. So me and my brother had detention for about six months. Anyway it went from lunch detention to after school detention.  Well my dad never picked us up until 2 hours after school finished, So the detention didn't really matter to us. \n\n Anyway about 6 months or so into the year the principal gotten involved and asked us what we were doing and why were late.  He mainly got involved because he saw me and my brother sit out front for 2 hours on the one day we didn't come late. \n\nMy dad called and explained the situation and the principal said that we were gonna get worse punishment and my dad said that he didn't care because he doesn't pick us up right away anyway. \n\nAnd after the principal gave us passes saying our situation was different than actually being late and signed us out of late detention for the rest of the time my dad was at that job.", "she is teaching them that punctuality does not matter, and unfortunately ( I am not a naturally punctual person by nature) it does, quite a lot actually. NTA", "NTA, in the meeting let them know how your wife feels about the kids school. Not a big deal since they are young. School should not start so early. Then suggest maybe they can change school hours to fit your wife's schedule. At this point there is nothing you can do about it as you are working. Privately tell the school to suspend your kids for 1 day for being late and that if they continue on being late they will keep getting suspended. I'm sure your wife won't have anyone to watch the kids last min. That will be a call-out for her from work. That will be a reality check for her knowing that she will have to watch the kids every time they get suspended. With her job now on the line that should straighten her out. \nMaybe suggest to your wife if she can get a shift that starts 30 mins earlier this way she can drop off the kids and go straight to work.  Either way your wife has a bad attitude and is teaching them a wrong lesson.", "NTA. Your wife is being absurd, and is teaching your children that school and timeliness are not important. She has no legitimate excuse for this behavior and your children are missing out on valuable education as well.", "My goodness I have just seen that you are in the UK. Your wife needs to understand that this is serious, you don\u2019t get to choose what time you get your kids to school, that they get an education is a legal requirement. Next step will be the school involving social services - if they haven\u2019t already. Your wife is an idiot. But if my husband spoke like that to me I\u2019d think my kids would be better or with 1 parent. NTA", "NTA. Your wife might think 30 minutes late isn't a big deal, especially at this age, but it is. I work at an elementary school and while there might be 5-10 minutes of time where teachers are taking attendance and get kids organized, teaching begins shortly thereafter. This means your kids are missing crucial teaching time. While all grade levels are important, the 1st three years are crucial in making sure that they learn to read and write, which is a critical skill for success in the later grades. These are also the years where their attitude toward education is being formed. If your wife treats it as unimportant, they will also learn that school isn't important.", "NTA. I had a similar problem with my own mom growing up and lost my ever loving little mind when I got called into the principal's office and told I would be be repeating a grade if we were late one more time. By maybe 2nd or 3rd grade, dad started letting us walk to school and we were never late again. I know OP's kids aren't old enough to walk (and other logistics), but that feeling of being told you're going to fail because of something you as a child have no control over was traumatizing. I hope OP's wife figures her shit out and saves her kids from that feeling.", "NTA around here, chronic tardiness falls under the attendance policy. Three consecutive instances of a kid being classified as a truant (absent or more than 20 mins late over 3 days per 30 attendance days) means parents can be reported to and fined by the city. Continued instances can get parents arrested after that. Do not let your wife continue this.", "NTA but only because your wife agreed to an arrangement and then went behind your back to do something different. Now that you know the problem, it would be an E S H situation if you did nothing.\n\nYou two are both working so it sounds like you can both chip in for a nanny in the mornings. 2 hours a day should get the kids woken, ready and dropped off at school. Maybe throw in a little homework checking or exercise since you\u2019re paying.", "Wow.............  I was seriously getting ready to call you out, but holy lateness batman, you are so NTA.   She really does need to grow up.   I don't even have the words for how wrong this is.  I despise early mornings.  So do my girls.   This year, they changed the school day to start at 720 am.   We make it work.   They are NEVER late.", "Nta. Why not take a nap in the car after dropping off the children?", "I'm not sure how it is in your area or OPs area, but the schools here have \"count days.\" This is where the school's funding comes from. They have to report to the state how many kids are attending school on that particular day. It's been explained to me that if a child is absent when the count is taken, they lose some of their funding... however, they can count a kid if the kid was present on a different day that week (if count day is missed by the student). If a kid is late and missed the count, that child does not count. If the child is late all week that week and missed attendance throughout the week, the child can not be counted. This is just a basic explanation of the rules as it was explained to me. \n\nMy kids' school sends out emails and automated calls to each parent the week before the count day and the day before the count day as a reminder. When I was undergoing medical treatments a few years ago, I got a call to make sure all my kids would be in school on count day (my kids weren't absent during treatment but there were times when I had a really difficult time getting up and driving them to school so they were late approx 2 to 3x a month) from the superintendent. Not to berate me for them being late sometimes, but to ask if I would need help getting them to school on time for the week so that they could all be counted and they could get the appropriate funding.\n\nAnyhow,  long story short, if her kids' school has count days and the kids aren't able to be counted.. the principal may be inclined to report the kids/parents to whatever truancy/cps agency that is in their area, especially seeing as how the principal has already tried to address the problem. \n\nAlso, how rude is it that OPs wife is interrupting every other single students learning process by taking her kids to school late! And interrupting teachers doing their jobs! For no darn reason other than being lazy. I felt bad when I sent my kids to school late, and I had a medical reason. What she is doing is very selfish. I'm sure it's embarrassing to OPs kids also. I know my kids hated being late for class and walking into the room with everyone watching. I'm grateful that my kids' teachers were willing to work with me. But truly, it's parents like OPs wife that make teachers hate their career choices. \n\nOP, I hope you are able to talk some sense into your wife before any of this escalates.

My kids are occasionally late because it's really hard to get kids out the door! Sometimes one has to poop right as it's time to load up the car, and then what?

But I have a 4 and 6 year olds that are never late... You build a routine that works and you stick to it. If she was having a hard time with it... I would say to do things the night before, make lunches, pull out outfits, that sort of thing or drag your butt out of bed earlier. A six year old can and should have the ability to get themself going in the morning you set them up and give them gentle reminders to stay on task while you do what you need to do (In my case it's get myself ready, make lunches, get the car going and the snow and ice off it because I live in a frozen hellscape, take out the trash and recycling, get their winter gear sorted and ready and deal with the 4 year old). My older daughter knows the morning routine at this point and it's teaching her to be accountable for herself.

I teach first grade and the chronically tardy kids miss the best part of the day\u2014the morning is when you check in with the kids, change the calendar, sing songs, etc. Basically all the fun warm fuzzy activities that get them ready for the day.

There is no reason she cannot get her poop in a group. She has an HOUR between them starting school and her starting work. She needs to get up earlier, get herself ready, get them going and hell, with that time between drop off and starting work she should go get herself a coffee if she wants to reward herself for her hard work and then get into work a few minutes early because they notice that in retail and that's how you get better pay, hours, days off when you need them and in a lot of cases promotions when they come up. A retail job isn't going to give you any preferential treatment unless you deserve it. I am not saying to start work per se... Just hang out in the break room and sip that coffee.
