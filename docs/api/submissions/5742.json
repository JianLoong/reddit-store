I understand that's a bit of an awkward time for my wife to get them there when her workplace is very close to the school, but that's just life things.\n\nBefore the kids broke up for the holidays, I got an email off the school's principal explaining that our kids have been consistently late for school over the past few weeks and that it has sparked a lot of concern. \n\nI knew that the kids had been late a few times as they mentioned it to me, but I had no idea it was everyday.

She thought it was funny and said that it's not a big deal if our kids are 30-40 minutes late to school, and it's not like they're in high school yet. She said she likes to sleep in and that there's no reason for her to leave earlier when she starts work at 9, and she doesn't want to go to work early or go back home.\n\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing.

She said school shouldn't start so early and that she's getting them to school so what's the big deal. \n\nI told her to stop being lazy and leave the house earlier in the morning and grow up.

Calling the wife lazy wasn't the nicest thing to say, but it does sound like she's consciously choosing to sleep in rather than prioritize the kids' education and instilling necessary life habits. She's prioritizing her own wants over the kids' needs. \n\nNTA", "Either way someone has to get them ready? \ud83e\udd37 I've been doing it along with drop-off for a long time, I just had to start the day earlier in the morning so we had plenty of time.\n\nI get that it's annoying and not ideal, I really do, but I still think it's a very minor inconvenience. I suppose it probably was easier for me because I'm naturally an early bird, my brain won't let me sleep past 6am even on weekends.\n\nIf you think I'm the AH because I'm not being sympathetic I respect that opinion though, I just wanted to express my pov.", "I've been 3 hours early to work for a few months before. It sucks but you gotta do what you gotta do.", "My concern.. (I worked for a district a lifetime ago) is the repeated behaviour.. and I am thinking the principal will probably point this out too... is that if it keeps happening it will force their hands to call the authorities \n\nAnd depending where you live.. esp. In a conservative area.. I can see this spiraling into a nightmare that could easily be prevented. \n\nOther idea I just had..  my parents had similar issues when I was younger (and a younger sibling). I know my dad would drop us off and have a couple of hours before he had shift (cop). What did he do? Sometimes he would drive to work and take a power nap in the car. Sometimes he would run some errands so he would do it after work. Sometimes.. hell... he would go to the bookstore and wander around because that was one of his \"me\" things \nMaybe spin it to her that is an hour she has (and change) between drop off and work that she literally could do anything she wants. Read a book. Grab coffee with a coworker etc", "Not saying Y are TA, but I think you are oversimplifying the extra burden on your wife, especially if she is not an early bird. It's not an equivalent burden to you doing it since you are a morning person.\n\nAgain, having said that, she is definitely an AH for just literally blowing off school start times which impacts your kids, their teacher, and their class. Thats why I went mid with ESH, but really just because what she is supposed to do seems easy to you and it isn't for everyone. That doesn't mean her response is at all ok though. \n\nPublic schools can also file child welfare reports with enough absences and late attendances, especially if a parent is not taking it seriously. So she definitely needs to understand that this is no joke, and has to stop.", "I completely agree, the wife is in the wrong here. 1000%. But acting like it's no big deal to get 2 kids ready and off to school solo in the am, with an hour to spare before work...that's also not helpful. I think some empathy could have gone a long way vs \"it's life and she's lazy.\"", "I feel like empathy went out the window when she started laughing and saying it's no big deal.\n\nThat goes from \"it's hard and I have trouble\" to \"Idgaf and just want to sleep\".\n\nWhich means you go from struggling but trying to selfish"]}
