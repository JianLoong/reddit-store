I got a call one morning from his manager, informing me that my husband had been in a car accident and was in the hospital. He couldn't tell me much but said that although he was stable, it didn't look good and that I should come as soon as I can. I obviously freaked out. I booked a ticket just for myself, because it would be almost impossible to travel with Max, and I could barely afford the last-minute ticket for myself.\n\nI called my mom who lives a few hours away and asked her to come watch Max while I'm away. At this point, I needed someone to watch Max for the time it would take for my mom to arrive so I could make my flight. Looking back, I probably could've handled the logistics better than this, but I was hysterical and was just doing things as I thought of them.\n\nI called 3 friends - 1 didn't answer, and two were unable to help. Luckily, we live close to my brother and SIL, who have a daughter (17f), \"Sarah.\" We are very close with them. Sarah answered the door and said her parents were out. I explained the situation and asked if she'd watch Max for a couple hours until my mom came.\n\nI should note that Sarah babysits for a few local families and obviously charges them for her services. We have never asked Sarah to babysit before.\n\nShe showed some concern for my husband and when I asked her again, she said something along the lines of, \"well, you'll pay me, right? I usually charge X...\" I stared at her for a moment, not really expecting that response, and then my friend who didn't answer called me back and said of course she'd watch Max. So, I took Max and left without saying anything to my niece. I coordinated with my friend and my mom, then flew to see my husband. He ended up needing surgery, but is making a full recovery.\n\nA few days after he was able to fly home, we had dinner with my brother and SIL. We were talking about the accident, and I mentioned that I had asked Sarah to watch Max. I also noted that I was a little upset that she brought up payment in that moment. My brother was surprised, and said he would talk to her as that's not an appropriate reaction. My SIL interjected and said she was proud of Sarah for advocating for herself. She and I argued and she said that I was entitled for being surprised that Sarah asked for money.\n\nTo be clear, if I asked Sarah to babysit under normal circumstances, I would absolutely expect to pay her. It was unsettling that Sarah would bring up payment while, for all I knew, my husband was dying in a hospital on the other side of the country. I think it would've been more empathetic to bring up the topic of payment after I returned + confirmed my husband was okay. My SIL is still being cold with me, and so is my niece.

Like what? She was family, your husband was potentially dying, and her only concern was money. Like, she wouldn\u2019t even commit until she had confirmation of that. I have a daughter and the last thing I would be is proud of her in those circumstances. I would be incredibly disappointed, as I would like to think I raised her better than that. It\u2019s not like you asked a stranger to watch him. I seriously do not understand everyone who is defending the niece right now\u2026.", "NAH.  Sarah is a teenager and, really, all she did was ask for payment for babysitting.  Socially flawless?  No, but again, teenager.  You were upset and worried and just didn't answer then went about your business.  It may have been awkward, or something you didn't like, but imo no one is an AH here.", "NTA. My aunt refused to babysit my brother and I when our dad was possibly dying. This was 20 years ago. My mom's relationship with her never recovered. Niece needs to learn time and place to advocate for herself. Reddit likes to say we don't owe others anything, but you do. You owe them empathy if you expect to be part of a family unit.", "NTA - you were having a genuine emergency and honestly it feels a little bit cruel for a family member to bring up payment right that moment when you were trying to settle things so you could rush to be with your possibly-dying spouse. If my child had acted like that I would be ashamed at their lack of compassion. As for those saying \u201cfree labor\u201d, yes, of course niece should be compensated for helping out but you don\u2019t pay the ER doctor *before* the lifesaving emergency surgery. They save you first and *then* ask to be paid.", "[removed]", "NTA. Your niece is old enough to understand that in an emergency, you help first and think of payment later, if at all.

I get nobody is entitled to another person\u2019s time and normally I\u2019m in agreement with advocating for boundaries and expectations but this is not the time.

I can only judge on my own personal opinion, so that's what I'm giving. In a time of crisis, I consider pretty much everything you ask for from your support network to be a \"favor\" with zero expected reciprocity, payment, etc. It's how I was raised, how I treat others, and how everyone in my support network treats me. \n\nIt sounds like you probably feel similarly to me, while your niece and SIL don't feel that emergencies/crises are any different than any other request. Though, I don't think it's fair to say you were being entitled. You were in a panic, and you were expecting family/friends to be focusing on your crisis with the same level of concern that you were...that's not entitlement, that's just a misalignment of expectations.", "NTA It is really upsetting that a family members response was to ask for money when your husband might be dying \n\nShe's 17 so you forgive it but who thinks that is the time (different if it was leaving him days and needing money for food but this is not necessity)\n\nI absolutely believe you would've paid after\n\nHaving lost people I have a clue where your head was", "I absolutely understand that people are not entitled to free services, but this was a FAMILY EMERGENCY? Where is the compassion and empathy? Obviously you don't have to provide free childcare, but this is an extreme case. NTA, and I hope your husband is doing better", "NTA.  The phrase that comes to mind is war profiteering.  When tragedy hits, some people respond with compassion and service.  Others respond with a chance to line pockets with profit.  Your niece is not \"wrong\" in requesting payment, but unfortunately her character has been revealed with her response.", "I understand that you feel that your niece's reaction was insensitive to your circumstances, but it's not unreasonable to be asked to be paid for labor. Whether you're in crisis or not, you're still asking her to work.\n\nIn fact, you believing that your emergency entitles you to free labor seems problematic to me. Did you expect the doctors and nurses at your husband's hospital to patch him up for free also? Did you expect the pilot flying you to your husband's side to do so for free? No. You paid them for their services. Why is your niece exempted from that?\n\nGentle YTA.

Not the time at all.", "You\u2019re NTA, your niece sounds a little selfish, I would never feel good about asking for money in that kind of situation.

Also, she does this for work, so it makes sense she didn't want to give away her services for free (I know many family members that ask people that fix computers, for instance, to look at theirs for free). Would it have been nice if she did it for free being that it's an emergency? Sure, but she's not obligated to.", "NAH. You expected free care in the moment, and your niece expected to be compensated for her time.", "YTA.  I\u2019m sorry you found yourself in such a terrible and stressful bind.  But considering you would have *had* to pay an emergency sitter if all your contacts had fallen through, I don\u2019t think this is as unreasonable an ask as you\u2019re trying to argue.  Although honestly, this is the part that gets me:\n\n> I think it would've been more empathetic to bring up the topic of payment after I returned \n\nYou mean *after* she\u2019d already rendered services and couldn\u2019t do anything about it if you continued to insist you shouldn\u2019t be charged, let alone tried to argue (as most people would) she should have said something in advance if that was the expectation?  Yeah, no.  You didn\u2019t want to pay her rates, and fortunately, you didn\u2019t have to.  Move on and drop the shame campaign.", "You\u2019re a soft AH. I understand you were stressed out but I want to point out something. You said she asked for payment when for all you know your husband might \nbe dying, um NO the hospital told you he was stable. So don\u2019t make it sound worse than it was. Also YOU put her in a bad position because she shouldn\u2019t have to ask. It would be nice if she didn\u2019t charge you anything but in no way should you be mad or feel entitled not to pay someone who babysits regular FOR PAY any more than you are entitled to a free doctor when you are in an emergency. Would you ever expect the medical team to work for free because it was a crisis situation? Of course not. Do you think watching YOUR CHILD is a less important job? Of course not. Put it into perspective. Watching your son was very important. I wish you had just handed her cash without her even asking but absolutely do not be angry. I\u2019d also like to point out that she didn\u2019t say no, if you had said we will have to discuss it later, all she did was tell you what she normally charges. She was not being a jerk.", "YTA, doesn't matter what state your husband is in, you're entitled to nothing.", "NTA\n\nShe's family and it was an emergency situation. Totally inappropriate bc you were asking her as a family member not like \"a professional\"", "NTA - I'm surprised by the comments lol. Your niece is cold-blooded. This was an unexpected and serious family emergency and your niece's response was highly inappropriate and insensitive. If this wasn't a family emergency then yes it would be totally fine for your niece to ask for payment.\n\nI wouldn't make a further deal of it as it is not worth it. Focus on your family and help your husband make a full recovery. Your relationship with your niece is highly transactional and it seems like your sister-in-law has the same mindset.

Good for her for standing up for herself. \n\nI am sorry you had that happen and I hope your husband recovers well. \n\nI also hope you see that you are in the wrong here. That should have been you who said it first. You need her help and will reimburse her when you get back. Had you not assumed she should do this for free. You wouldn't be here now", "NAH. You were under duress and your niece is only 17. I agree with her mom that it is great she advocates for herself and I agree with you that it was untimely to ask for compensation but she's quite young and deserves a pass.", "I understand your hurt (and maybe a feeling of being taken advantage during a stressful time), but your niece babysits for living. This is her business, so to speak. If you\u2019ve called your regular babysitter (in case there is one), you would have offered to pay her - not only the regular wage, but a premium, because of the short notice.\n\nSo, while your hurt is understandable, I feel it is misplaced.", "I'm assuming when you booked that last-minute flight with the airline, they asked for payment even though it was an emergency, and you paid.  Why should Sarah's services be any different?\n\nCould Sarah have waited to discuss payment at a later time when you weren't so frenzied? Yes. But I think it's weird to hold a grudge against a teenager for this.\n\nYTA.", "Assuming you're in a good relationship with Sarah and her family, NTA. Friends and families do things for one another in times of crisis and payment should not come into the picture. Particularly if the favor only required a few hours of time AND it is something you are familiar with! Sure, there are exceptions - if Sarah would have had to miss work and couldn't afford to without being compensated, I can see how payment would come up even in a crisis. But if she could accommodate the request with no consequences, she should.\n\nThat being said, it's a gentle Y T A for Sarah. \n\n  I really don't understand the Y T A argument for OP tho. In unexpected times of CRISIS, can FAMILY really not be expected to do a favor for free? This is different to entitlement - there was no way OP could have seen this coming and she was probably freaking the fuck out.", "NAH, emotional situation for you and niece just heard \"work\" and was checking on pay. Don't be mad at a kid for looking out for themselves, likely no previously experience to rely on here in a tense situation. SIL is a bit of a piece of wood here, but I'd let sleeping dogs lie on this one. Hope everything works out for you, best of luck.", "YTA\n\nShe has probably been burned before by relatives that expect her to babysit for free.

Sorry about your experience, but it doesn't give you a right to free childcare. \n\nThat being said, its surprising that you're still harping on about it. Your husband is fine, everything worked out, but this is still in your head enough to post on Reddit about it. Why?", "Lightly ESH\n\nNot saying you did expect it, but I can see how you might be viewed as expecting free childcare; which is AHish. Obviously the situation sucked and you were rightly worried about your husband, but your niece isn't obligated to do anything. \n\nYour niece sucks for bringing up payment in a family emergency, I agree she could have brought it up later, but you also could have offered to pay her for her time later after everything was resolved.\n\nYour SIL sucks for being mad about it. Sure setting boundaries is good, but maybe make the argument for it in a different situation. \n\nOverall, it could have been handled better but given the circumstances, I don't think you're outright the AH. Glad everything is okay!", "NAH. Only you can understand the emotional turmoil of that moment. A 17 year old CANNOT fathom that and would not know the right things to say or not say. To her, you were asking a professional babysitter for babysitting services. She doesn't have the life experience to make the nuanced distinction you expected her to make in that moment.\n\nYou are not the AH for being hurt that she looked at you and saw dollar signs instead of looking at you and seeing her aunt in absolute distress. That would hurt anyone and make them question their value to their niece. But again, you're talking about a teenager whose brain still believes that it is the center of the universe and who cannot fathom what you felt in that moment. All I glean from your niece's reaction is that you were probably holding it together better than you think you were.\n\nYou SIL is an AH. She's armchair quarterbacking without considering your emotional state at the moment you asked for help.

Second, you should have said \"yes, of course\" when your niece asked about payment and gone off to do . . . whatever else you needed to do to get ready for your flight. Instead, you dropped your son off with a different friend (suggesting you weren't so hysterical that you couldn't make deliberate choices). ~~There's also the question of what kind of aunt you are to \"Sarah.\" (Note, this is not a question about your relationship to your brother and your sister\u2013in\u2013law, but your relationship with your niece.)~~\n\nNow we'll do your niece. Expecting payment for watching a child for three hours in a true emergency like you suffered is really not cool of her. Not cool at all. This is one of the few situations where \"family helps family\" is legitimate.\n\n**EDIT:** Given the clarifying comment by OP, I have changed my response. Given that Sarah is close to OP (close enough to come to her for advice or to rant about her parents), it's really shitty of Sarah to start asking about money. Should OP pay her or offer her some reward for stepping up? Yes, absolutely. But Sarah ought to have watched the three year old for those few hours. (No, it doesn't matter how rambunctious Max is. If Sarah is willing to put up with his rambunctiousness for pay, she can do it for a few hours to help her aunt.)", "NAH, but your niece probably contextually was immature about it.

I got a call one morning from his manager, informing me that my husband had been in a car accident and was in the hospital. He couldn't tell me much but said that although he was stable, it didn't look good and that I should come as soon as I can. I obviously freaked out. I booked a ticket just for myself, because it would be almost impossible to travel with Max, and I could barely afford the last-minute ticket for myself.\n\nI called my mom who lives a few hours away and asked her to come watch Max while I'm away. At this point, I needed someone to watch Max for the time it would take for my mom to arrive so I could make my flight. Looking back, I probably could've handled the logistics better than this, but I was hysterical and was just doing things as I thought of them.\n\nI called 3 friends - 1 didn't answer, and two were unable to help. Luckily, we live close to my brother and SIL, who have a daughter (17f), \"Sarah.\" We are very close with them. Sarah answered the door and said her parents were out. I explained the situation and asked if she'd watch Max for a couple hours until my mom came.\n\nI should note that Sarah babysits for a few local families and obviously charges them for her services. We have never asked Sarah to babysit before.\n\nShe showed some concern for my husband and when I asked her again, she said something along the lines of, \"well, you'll pay me, right? I usually charge X...\" I stared at her for a moment, not really expecting that response, and then my friend who didn't answer called me back and said of course she'd watch Max. So, I took Max and left without saying anything to my niece. I coordinated with my friend and my mom, then flew to see my husband. He ended up needing surgery, but is making a full recovery.\n\nA few days after he was able to fly home, we had dinner with my brother and SIL. We were talking about the accident, and I mentioned that I had asked Sarah to watch Max. I also noted that I was a little upset that she brought up payment in that moment. My brother was surprised, and said he would talk to her as that's not an appropriate reaction. My SIL interjected and said she was proud of Sarah for advocating for herself. She and I argued and she said that I was entitled for being surprised that Sarah asked for money.\n\nTo be clear, if I asked Sarah to babysit under normal circumstances, I would absolutely expect to pay her. It was unsettling that Sarah would bring up payment while, for all I knew, my husband was dying in a hospital on the other side of the country. I think it would've been more empathetic to bring up the topic of payment after I returned + confirmed my husband was okay. My SIL is still being cold with me, and so is my niece.

Honestly its the SIL that I think acts the worst here, that's not advocating.", "Your feelings are understandable, it is a bit insensitive of her but your niece doesn\u2019t owe you anything, not even in an emergency.

I get that you were under great duress, but the appropriate time to make sure terms are clear is before you perform the work you've been asked to do, not after. Sarah did exactly right in just asking upfront to make sure everyone understood the arrangement, instead of being quietly anxious about it and making a thing of it later like most teenagers likely would. I hope your husband is recovering well!", "YTA   Here's the thing... unless it's offered for free in advance you should expect to pay someone to watch your offspring.....Emergency or not.  Your child's care is your responsibility.... emergency or not.\n\nYou can call a hospital and ask for status on a spouse.", "Soft YTA. My big issue with this is that you said you\u2019d be more comfortable if the 17 year old had asked about payment after she watched your kid. I have doubt about this. Most people would be upset because the expectation should have been set upfront. Plus, if you know she babysits to make money, it seems reasonable to me that she would expect some sort of payment for babysitting since that is her job. Also, she\u2019s 17. She\u2019s still a kid. Why are you holding a grudge with a 17 year old?", "NTA, my parents would have died of shame and rage if I\u2019d pulled something like this as a teenager. I just can\u2019t fathom asking my aunt to pay me in this situation. Now you know how she and your SIL view familial bonds, so they never get one teeny tiny favor ever again.", "NAH\n\nAt 17, if my aunt landed on my doorstep all flustered and in a panic with my 3yo cousin who I\u2019d never babysat for before and asked me to watch him for a while, I\u2019d cling to what was familiar as well. I\u2019m being asked to babysit - I usually get paid to babysit - ask about payment.\n\nFor all you knew, her next statement might have been \u201cSorry, we can discuss that later, go go go.\u201d Or not. But we don\u2019t know, because you asked her to watch your son, took a call, then turned around and left without another word.\n\nSo, without knowing exactly how you framed the situation to your niece in that moment, NAH for now.\n\nI\u2019m really glad your husband is okay.", "NTA\n\nI have a daughter Sarah\u2019s age.

YTA and most people ( if spouse were dying) would say \u201cof course\u201d rather than go to another location or wait a moment before getting underway. You were also letting money in the way of your emergency.", "YTA. Would it be nice for her to babysit for you? Yes. But she's not obligated to. And it doesn't matter if it's an emergency, you still have to pay for services you use. And you're not entitled to someone's services for free just because they're family or you're in a tight spot.", "It sounds to me that Sarah has had bad experiences with other people not paying her. I know hardworking teens who have gone unpaid because they didn\u2019t know how to negotiate or set boundaries and ended up feeling foolish afterwards, especially when it came to helping relatives. I\u2019m not saying that you wouldn\u2019t have paid her, but she had no way of knowing without asking you. \n\nShe didn\u2019t have an empathetic response to your emergency. However, just as you expect empathy for your situation, as the adult it would be gracious if you overlooked her mistake. What would\u2019ve been a kind response is to say of course you would pay, but to privately express to her later that in the emergency situation you were a little hurt that she wasn\u2019t more concerned about your husband as her first reaction. By bringing it up to her parents you were making it a a more awkward situation. \n\nMy kids are older teens and they have benefited from relatives giving them the benefit of the doubt but also pulling them aside and gently speaking to them. And I\u2019ve done the same with my nieces and nephews. I try to come to them with the assumption that they have good intentions but haven\u2019t learned proper etiquette yet. As a result we have a good relationship. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is the AH here, just a lot of high emotions and assumptions in a stressful situation.", "NTA, i would be so embarrassed and angry if my teen daughters asked for money to watch their cousin in an emergency. That is not advocating for yourself, that is lacking empathy.", "YTA -  as an adult you are expected to pay for services provided despite your situation.  Your niece babysits to earn money.  I\u2019m sure it appeared to her, you were asking her for a favor.  She was clarifying, she did not want to do this as a favor.  If you judge her for this, then you are entitled.  Surely you can afford to pay her.  As an adult, the first thing I would have told her before she asked, was she would be paid her rate plus be given a small bonus for the short notice.  But hey, I feel like I should take care of my kids and no one owes me anything!   As far as family doing favors for each other, they totally can if that is how they feel.  I would still insist on paying a 17 year old kid to watch my child.", "YTA, while it wasn't the time or place I wouldn't be surprised if it was an automatic response on Sarah's part to remind whomever is asking for her to babysit of her fees. Especially if she gets that a lot. Also, I feel that it's unreasonable for you to assume that she should have waited until after you came back to ask for payment since that's how babysitters end up providing free services because, \"we never agreed I'd pay you before now.\".", "NTA, but your neice isn't one either. Life doesn't stop at tragity. Family or not, she should not be expected giving up her time to help you. Emergency or not. Time is money. Just take this as a learning experience. You can't depend on them for FREE babysitting obviously.", "YTA. 100%", "Didn\u2019t she also say she had never had Sarah babysit before? So how is Sarah going to know that she will be paid if she doesn\u2019t ask beforehand? This is not a normal circumstance for either of them and setting appropriate expectations is never a bad idea.", "I agree with this. I think SIL is right in saying she's proud of her daughter advocating for herself, because in general yes, that's good. We've seen many posts here of family trying to take advantage of family, in this situation I personally think it wasn't necessary since she was only asking for a sitter until her mom arrived in a few hours, and only because it was an emergency. Overall I don't personally think anyone is an AH. It was a chaotic situation that thankfully resolved itself, in laws could always talk to their daughter about special circumstances, but it's still up to the daughter to make that decision.", "> you don\u2019t pay the ER doctor before the lifesaving emergency surgery.

If she asked after everything died down then I\u2019d go NAH. However, asking right then and there is not the right time at all", "A lot of posters here seem to think 17 year olds are idiots. I don't even think the average 7 year old would respond this way to a family member in crisis.", "I'm confused, do you see the airline or hospital as war profiteering in those situations?  Her niece is paid to babysit", "Profiteering would be the niece saying \u201csince you\u2019re desperate, my rates just doubled\u201d. She knows her time has value and stated her standard rates - that\u2019s just standard babysitting practice.", "Is the airline war profiteering?", "How venal can you get.

This isn't a \"labor agreement\" in that moment, it's a family emergency.", "While I feel everyone is free to refuse, I'd definitely change how I consider this person someone I will treat like family if help in an emergency was seen as a transaction of labor for money.\n\nMaybe if she had to skip a shift or something, it would be cool to say that, but that wasn't the case.\n\nAll gifts from now on would be shit, and I'd for sure charge for every little inch I'd have to move for her. People are allowed to say no, but they need to deal with the consequences.\n\nPeople can abuse demanding \"free labor because family\", but that's clearly not the situation.\n\nNTA", "Nicely said, this is what I was coming to say. I can understand how families normally step in for each other in times of emergency and she was willing to make the time right that minute to help. Her expecting to be paid for that time, while slightly irritating as a family member, is also reasonable. I would be more upset possibly about a sister, brother, or mother who did that, but a teenager doesn\u2019t surprise me at all.\n\nI also agree with the other comment that if she hadn\u2019t asked for payment, she\u2019d likely be arguing with you to pay her after the fact and your argument would likely be the same + that she didn\u2019t say she expected to be paid. So if she expects payment, up front is exactly the time to discuss it.\n\nIt all boils down to\u2026it\u2019s family. If you expect freebies like that, then you should\u2019ve arranged it in advance.

Not entirely unreasonable", "I get what you're saying, however, I never refused to pay her. If my friend hadn't called, I would have agreed to whatever rate and left my kid with her bc I'd have no other option. I wasn't upset about potentially having to pay; like I said, if it were a normal situation, I wouldn't think twice about her request for payment, even though she's family. \n\nI also think that asking family for help in an emergency is a bit different than enlisting the services of doctors, pilots, etc. I often watch my friends' kids for free, and even watched Sarah when she was little. In my family, we support each other no questions asked, so it was just upsetting that she showed little empathy in an emergency situation, is all.", "I wanted to say the same thing but you said it so much better.

Especially if you are family. I don't talk to half of my family but if they came to my door in an emergency like that, the child shouldn't be neglected and she shouldn't have to wait to see her husband not knowing the outcome.

I'm also 17, and I've babysat for my aunt with 2 girls before, the oldest of which just recently turned 9 yrs old, and she's paid me every time, but in an emergency situation I wouldn't expect anything from her.

This left the kids unattended. They lived relatively close to us, but there was this other family with a girl my age that lived further away. They were closer to this family, so they asked if the girl could watch the kids. They had gotten them someone else to watch the kids overnight but this girl had to relieve them in the morning. So the girl stayed at my house that night. I gave her my bed and slept on the couch myself. My dad drove her over the next morning to babysit the kids. Oh, did I mention that was a school day and she had to skip classes to do this? And there was never even a question as to whether or not to do this. Asking for payment? That would have been monstrous under the circumstances. And that was not even family or close friends.

I also got an allowance for doing chores at home, many of them similar to what I did there. I just stepped up and took responsibility for cleaning up, making sure peoples laundry was getting switched over, and making sure food was easy to get as people were coming and going constantly and NOT ONCE did I even think of asking for any sort of payment because it was family and everyone was doing what they needed to to help my Gma and get through it.", "Title made me think OP was an AH because kids should advocate for themselves and then \u2026 oh. \n\nIt\u2019s the lack of empathy here and trying to take advantage of a person in a bad situation that got me.

Oh boy.\nEdit- I\u2019m sure someone else has mentioned this already but It comes to mind the ONLY way I could see expectation of compensation up front in this situation would be if like\u2026 an adult who really needed the money for life and sustenance called out of a shift to help out and it was actually putting them in a bind, but yeah the kid is more important.

She went too far this time but she\u2019s 17 and is new to it and her mom is encouraging her to do this as well. In normal situations, she absolutely should be establishing firm boundaries and not let people take advantage of her and this could be a very good learning lesson and I hope it ends up being one.

Would it have been nice for your niece to not worry about getting paid in this case? Sure, but not a requirement. If you had to call up a professional, you'd probably pay extra for the immediate nature of the situation (clearly not your fault, but a common practice in the service industry). And in all fairness, how would you have reacted if she asked you for payment after you came home and all was said and done? She was probably trying to go for the lesser evil. \n\nAll in all, I'm glad it worked out and that your husband is going to be ok. I'm sure that was terrifying for you.

And 2 hours go by, neighbor is home and all I get is a thank you) and so she has this little speech worked out in her head, perhaps coached by SIL so that others understand her time is valuable or whatever.  So she feels concern for the situation and expresses it, but being a teenager, she is also at a loss for anything else to say, so this little speech comes popping out.  She may even mistakenly feel that this is the sort of thing adults would say because discussing money is a serious thing and this a serious situation so she's sort of, well, responding in a serious fashion.

If my neighbours came up saying their spouse was in an accident & needed someone to look after their child, I wouldn't even think to expect payment - at the time or later. There are things you do to help a fellow human in emergencies, and to not even do it for family is appalling.

In that situation, I would have wanted to pay her and probably tip extra because she was willing to take the kiddo on no notice and help me out. As a parent if I was the mother of the niece I would then tell niece not to accept the money and pay her myself, because it\u2019s a good positive learning experience for your kid to not end up an asshole.

Honestly. You were shocked, and, ideally, your brother, and SIL would have been home.  They were not, and the 17 yr old was probably shocked, too. Most adults don't know what to do when faced with an emergency out of the blue. You are NTA for having feelings about this, but you also say that Max has a difficult time in unfamiliar situations. So, did you contact your bro/SIL to let them know to talk to their daughter?  Has your niece spent time with Max, alone, before? I have 2 kids, both in their 20s. Neither one would have known how to react. Not to mention that both have been stiffed by people for \"just watching\" children of friends and family for \"a few minutes\".  Give her a break.

It doesn't even matter if it's family or not. This is overrated in my opinion. Human decency -> someone is in a horrible situation asking for help.

Hence: I do it.\n\nIt should be simple as that, if one asks me.\n\nOn the other side she is a 17 year old girl and in opposition to what some might argue here: some teens are completely oblivious to reality. The stories that I sometimes get told by friends who are teachers are horrifying to say the least. Which brings me to the main problem that usually exists with children: parents. \n\nI wouldn't have expected for the girl to get a super rough scolding...scolding serves shit. But a serious conversation about her actions and what kind of person she portraits with her behaviour would definitely been appropriate. So the big looser in this is SIL.\n\nActually I would be interested how SIL and her husband resolved that among themselves. This seems to show a quite contradictory perspective on certain things.\n\nBut again: that's just personal opinion.", "It\u2019s distasteful but I don\u2019t necessarily think sarah was wrong. OP seems to indicate that for an emergency like this she wouldn\u2019t expect to pay sarah. It\u2019s selfish, but sarah is allowed to say no to \u201cworking \u201c for free.\n\nI feel like sarah was just being a teenager , whose probably been told to clarify upfront because a lot of people would expect stuff for free unless she asks, so she did it automatically. We don\u2019t know if she\u2019d have said in the end to forget the payment because OP never got there.", "NAH, just like you\u2019ve not dealt with this situation before, neither has Sarah. Your brother being surprised that Sarah asked for money is fair and his commitment to teaching her that it\u2019s not appropriate os absolutely right - but teenage years are for putting into practice what we  learn as kids, and learning new things that we\u2019ll need to lean on in adult years.\n\nWas her question inappropriate? YES! unfortunate timing? YES, but you went to her, and SIL is right - learning that when adults say JUMP, it\u2019s okay to query the height, the distance and the possible outcomes. Acting quickly in an emergency is a learned skill, I hope you\u2019ll show her some grace and not blame your anguish regarding your husband on the brash/uncouth query from your niece. \n\nIt seems silly that your SIL is helping niece make this a *thing* - but explain your feelings to niece (in brothers presence) and move past it.", "YTA. \u201cYeah of course\u201d.

The \"advocating\" part makes me think shes probably been tricked into working for free before.", "YTA. Pay the child.", "NAH. Look, I'm probably going to get downvoted for this, but tbh some teenagers actually do struggle with empathy and social scripts and social expectations-- the examples of comments teenagers make in this sub itself pretty much proves that. It's normal. And while that doesn't make her a good person for doing what she does, I find it really hard to call a teenager an asshole for not acting like an adult sometimes, and this is one of these times. A teenager put in an adult situation acted like a teenager, shocker. I do think it's the adult's job to be the bigger person here and not hold it against her.\n\nI like to think I grew up into a normal, empathetic person... and tbh, I absolutely think the first thing I would think about if a family member was asking me to watch their child during an emergency, at 17, would have been \"these are my babysitting rates?\" Today, I wouldn't think twice about babysitting the children in my family for free in an emergency, don't get me wrong... but today, I do have a good scale of understanding of what constitutes an emergency, and the backbone to turn something down outright that I'm not comfortable with, ect. Teenagers... teenagers are still learning, the whole function of that age is putting together their schemas of how to behave in the world. This is what you do when X happens, this is what you do when Y happens. It's totally understandable for a teenager to be at the point in their social development where they have the experience to see \"when someone outside your household asks you to do a labour task, advocate for your own value,\" without having the experience yet to recognize which situations are real emergencies they should be offering whatever they can. And in terms of preparing them to go into the current workforce, I also think it's totally understandable that some parents may find it way *more* important to teach their kids not to let someone walk all over them in a professional sense than teaching their kids to do favours for family members.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that contemporary teenagers can have a bit of a time shortage, and this isn't particularly new-- the American college system means any teenager who wasn't born rich and privilaged has to do hours of studying/homework to keep their grades up to get into the college they want and potentially get an academic scholarship, do extracurriculars to look good on college applications and maybe earn a scholarship, and also work a part-time job on the side because scholarships can't cover everything and what if you don't even earn any? If you're spending 8 hours a day sleeping (minimum! teenagers need more and probably aren't getting it), 6 hours in school, 2 hours on homework a night (which is a generous under-estimate for some students), and assuming 4 hours a day on either work or extracurriculars... that's 20 hours right there, and that's without discussing the time they need to eat breakfast and dinner, shower because teenagers are smelly, commute to school from home, school to work, work to home... and nevermind household responsibilities. This might seem silly to adults who work 40 hour weeks and balance families, but doing school, and then a work shift, and then having 2 hours of schoolwork to do at home... that's like working 12 hour shiftwork with the body of someone who still needs 9-10 hours of sleep a night according to most doctors. Obviously I have no idea how this girl's actual day looks, but the less free time you have, the less generous you tend to be about spending it doing favours.\n\nAlso, god, I don't want to keep excusing this girl because I do fundamentally disagree with her... but can we also recognize that a 17 year old girl maybe doesn't actually have an deep family relationship with her aunt? Loads of people don't have deep bonds with their extended family, sometimes extended family can just be strangers who share blood to a teenager, even if their parents are still close to that extended family. And tbh... is OP even close to her sibling's family? In an emergency, obviously people can behave illogically, so I'm not saying this is some amazing observation I've made when OP does say she's close to her sibling... but OP's brother was the fourth person she tried to contact to watch her kids after three friends, and she only considered Sarah because she happened to answer the door. And she's never asked her niece to babysit before (which, if you don't generally get babysitters make sense, but when it comes to babysitters it's very common for people to be asking the teenagers they actually know before hiring outside their social circle, firstly as a \"I know this kid, I trust this kid,\" and secondly as a \"If I'm paying a teenager to do labour, I might as well be giving money to a teenager I care about\".) This... doesn't sound like a family where the niece and her aunt have a strong enough bond I'd expect a teenager to immediately go, \"Yeah, you're *family*, of course I'll do a favour!\" In a family emergency, I truly couldn't imagine asking anyone before my brother to do a favour like this, if he lived so close to me?", "God, I know I'll sound like ITA,but from a straight babysitter POV, I can't remember how many OMG it's life or death you babysit, only for the obvious non-issue to occur(and i never got paid). I'll vote that there's NAH.

Everyone is so unreasonable and I guarantee they wouldn't keep their cool as much as the OPs I've seen today.", "eh, the family bit isn't really relevant.

I\u2019d not even feel bad the niece and SIL are acting cold. They\u2019ve shown who they are. Why would OP want them in her life at this point???", "17 is more than old enough for basic empathy", "This. I made many a social faux pas regarding money when I was 17, and your niece certainly did it (simply asking) in a way that was less offensive than mine. That didnt make me a bad person - my parents raised me well, and I was a decent kid (you know, for a teenager). You know what it made me? A short-sighted, self-interested 17 year old who was still figuring out how to appropriately negotiate issues/situations; and it sounds like that is really the only thing niece is \"guilty\" of here.\n\nAnd who knows - for all OP knows, if the niece is a known local babysitter, how many times has she been told that there's an emergency (whether or not they were actually genuine emergencies) with families she babysat, only to be left out of pocket (when she could have been putting her time and energy elsewhere)? So, I get why she asked, and I (kinda) get why the SIL said she had every right to advocate for herself - especially when women and girls are, more often than not, straight up \"expected\" to look after other people's children with zero recompense, simply on account of being female. I mean, how many times have we seen posts on this thread about family being taken advantage of?\n\nThat said, I get why OP is upset - being a family emergency, the nature of said emergency, etc. Reeeeaaaaalllllyyyyy not cool in the moment. I don't feel it was right for the SIL to keep fighting with OP about the issue, either.\n\nIs it a hill worth dying on? No. Niece is 17. No, she's not a \"kid\", but shes not an \"adult\" either - besides, all she did was ask. It was absolutely inappropriate and insensitive in the moment - but there's not something inherently \"wrong\" with her (like some people in the comments seem to be implying). She's just being, as I said before, a plain, ol' short-sighted and self-interested teenager. Perhaps her dad having a word with her might trigger a bit of introspection and a realisation of, \"Ah dang, that actually was a pretty dick move....\"; but that's niece's parents issue to deal with, not OP's. \n\nOP has every right to be upset, but I don't think she (or anyone on here) should be going too hard on her niece.\n\nEdit: wording", "completely disagree with this.

My parents were so grateful that when they came home late from the airport, they didn't have to freeze out in the snow just to get in their driveway/front door.

She's almost an adult; she's more than old enough to understand when is an appropriate time to ask for compensation and when is not. This is nothing more than her being more concerned about herself than literally anyone else... Which is far more probable than the innocent \"this is what grownups do, right? Teehee!\" situation you've created.", "and OP herself said she was hysterical - would be interesting to hear the niece's version of what OP told her.

The kid has sensory issues, and is difficult to travel with. That last part is explicitly mentioned. He would be a challenge for anyone to babysit.

OP could probably tank her babysitting business if she was petty by telling the community what happened. No one wants to hire someone so heartless that they demand payment from a woman who's husband was possibly dying, esp if it was the sitter's own aunt. If she's willing to be heartless with her own family, imagine how she would treat a random person/child. Not saying her clients deserve free emergency service, but most parents are extremely careful about who they hire to watch their children. It's a business PR nightmare.

Most adults don't even know how to handle this situation well. Let alone a teenager.\n\nAlso understandable that the question would come across as odd to OP. However, rather than staring at the child like she just threw up in your living room, a simple response like, \"oh of course, honey. Things are pretty stressful right now. Can we talk about the specifics later?\"\n\nThose saying the niece should just babysit for free because it's an emergency, sure, if you're close. She's never baby-sat for them before, so maybe it's not yet that kind of relationship.

I think your niece lacked tact, but we don't know about her situation. 17 years old, was she meant to be studying, at school, doing another babysitting job that day? Do her parents charge her rent? Does she have to save for college herself? All of these pressures that we put on teens in our ridiculous consumer society could prompt that initial instantaneous response from her.\n\nHer reaction could have been just from the surprise of the situation, similar to your surprise leading to maybe not handling the logistics of the situation well, and not giving her an immediate yes or no to her question. \n\nI don't think it is out of line to expect payment.

OP has said that she herself wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. Why would she expect more of a kid? And why make that kid look bad at a dinner with her parents? Does she have a history of scoring points?

Expecting a 17 year old to drop everything, for 3 hours, seems a little entitled even in the middle of a family emergency.

Most often for free for some of my 40 younger cousins. My dad has 6 siblings but we were much closer to 4 of the families than the other 2.

They are not paid for their babysitting, ever. My oldest watches my youngest and he\u2019s never paid for that either. My reasoning for that is helping family should always be a thing you just do. But they are compensated in other ways. My sisters will get the bags/shoes/clothes, gaming console, little trinkets, gift cards or whatever else they feel the kids will like as presents.

It's also normal to expect payment for babysitting. Everyone here is talking about empathy, which is great and fine, but if she hadn't been able to find a friend or family for free, she would have had to hire a babysitter, who would have been paid. Also if she was going places in person trying to find someone, it probably would have been faster, and a viable option, to just call the regular babysitter and ask if they are available. Why was this not a consideration? Why spend the extra time calling all these people, when a babysitter probably would have been faster unless she was actively trying to get free babysitting? \n\nUnless I didn't have the money, I wouldn't have balked at paying a family member if they asked, if it got me on the road to go to the actual emergency faster. Also, just because it's normal for family to help out, doesn't mean you should have that expectation of them. They have lives of their own too. They may not be available or capable for a variety of reasons. Expecting them to help you because you have an emergency and no backup plan is just asking for upset people on both sides. \n\nSituations like this are why it's good to have backup plans in place for if emergencies happen.

I think we can safely lay the blame at the SIL's feet.", "I was confused about the people saying it's crazy to expect sympathy from a teenager.

I need to know if OP was willing to pay in the end before the niece asked. Assuming someone will just help you for free, even if it is an emergency, is preposterous.

Sure, maybe the niece shouldn\u2019t have asked the question in that moment, but she is still a young person and deserves some slack. I don\u2019t think she was being malicious by asking to be paid for something that deserves payment. \n\nTeenagers are often exploited for their work.

The answer should have been \u201cof course I will pay you but we shouldn\u2019t discuss this right now because I\u2019m panicking\u201d I feel like just being up front with your feelings right then and there would\u2019ve helped. If you were offended that she asked to be paid at all, then you\u2019re definitely in the wrong. Emergencies don\u2019t exempt you from paying for services you need. And to announce it as a discussion in front of her family without talking to her first is disgusting to me. If someone did that with my parents, I would\u2019ve been screamed at and abused later on. Not saying these parents are abusive, but you\u2019re basically trying to get her in trouble for something that is really minor in the grand scheme of what happened. \n\nPlease be kind to teenagers.

OP is describing this terrifying emergency she's dealing with, like oh my God I have to get to my husband nownownow help me please!!! --oh hang on, you charge 12 bucks an hour??\n\nI mean, come on. That reaction doesn't add up, imo.", "Except they expect a lot of altruism if they need a favor.", "If you can't expect empathy from a teenager when can you? \n\nShe's a year away from being able to drink (in some places at least), to drive, to get insurance, to take out six-figure loans, to live alone / on residence. But expecting empathy is too much? I would strongly disagree - I expect empathy from adults and nothing from babies, and the closer you are the the former the more I expect. I would expect a 17-year-old to have 17/21 ths the empathy i'd expect from an adult - though judging by SIL's reaction, her adult female role model also lacks what i'd expect from an adult!", "This", "I've seen so many small children, even under 3, when they see another child crying they will go and comfort them the way they see us do it, even without prompting from us. They may not fully understand when they're very young, but they start to make the connection \"sad friend = needs comfort\".", "Even if you're right about the why of it, she's still an AH. Just an AH who made a mistake and can be forgiven. \n\n>especially difficult for women and girls who do the majority of unpaid labor\n\nMaybe keep your politics out of this. Do you know how many times I was asked to help move shit because I'm a guy? Nobody screeches about unpaid labor for spending the day moving heavy stuff or helping to build a fence, but they sure do when poor Sally has to watch the family young-uns for two hours.", "This is so dumb. Are you writing out some kind of stupid gotcha response like the idiots on the revenge subs? This kind of response isn\u2019t useful. It\u2019s stupid and no real person would say something like this.", "This. My mother refused to just come feed our dogs one night after my partner's grandfather had a massive stroke and we were told he might not last the night so we were going to stay at the hospital. It happened to be 4th of July, my mother accused us initially of trying to sabotage her plans, and then doubled down \"well once I knew it was serious I would have done it but you didn't give me a chance to.\" That was four years ago, and only one moment of many, but we're estranged now.   \n\n\nI bet you this isn't the only time SIL and Niece have shown a lack of empathy.", "YTA.\nIt\u2019s a little rude of someone to ask for money in a crisis, but also Sarah isn\u2019t an adult, and therefore may not understand what is acceptable in that situation or not. I doubt she\u2019s ever been asked to do something like that.\n\nOn top of that, you could\u2019ve explained that you wouldn\u2019t be willing to pay money and had a conversation about it, instead of just giving her the silent treatment. \n\nFor all I know, Sarah might\u2019ve had a job lined up that day, and would be losing money by doing this favor to you. However, I understand that\u2019s a pretty specific scenario.\n\nAll in all, Sarah probably doesn\u2019t have much experience with these kind of things, I highly doubt she had negative intentions, and it\u2019s the job or her seniors to educate her + help her grow as a person."]}
