I got a call one morning from his manager, informing me that my husband had been in a car accident and was in the hospital. He couldn't tell me much but said that although he was stable, it didn't look good and that I should come as soon as I can. I obviously freaked out. I booked a ticket just for myself, because it would be almost impossible to travel with Max, and I could barely afford the last-minute ticket for myself.\n\nI called my mom who lives a few hours away and asked her to come watch Max while I'm away. At this point, I needed someone to watch Max for the time it would take for my mom to arrive so I could make my flight. Looking back, I probably could've handled the logistics better than this, but I was hysterical and was just doing things as I thought of them.\n\nI called 3 friends - 1 didn't answer, and two were unable to help. Luckily, we live close to my brother and SIL, who have a daughter (17f), \"Sarah.\" We are very close with them. Sarah answered the door and said her parents were out. I explained the situation and asked if she'd watch Max for a couple hours until my mom came.\n\nI should note that Sarah babysits for a few local families and obviously charges them for her services. We have never asked Sarah to babysit before.\n\nShe showed some concern for my husband and when I asked her again, she said something along the lines of, \"well, you'll pay me, right? I usually charge X...\" I stared at her for a moment, not really expecting that response, and then my friend who didn't answer called me back and said of course she'd watch Max. So, I took Max and left without saying anything to my niece. I coordinated with my friend and my mom, then flew to see my husband. He ended up needing surgery, but is making a full recovery.\n\nA few days after he was able to fly home, we had dinner with my brother and SIL. We were talking about the accident, and I mentioned that I had asked Sarah to watch Max. I also noted that I was a little upset that she brought up payment in that moment. My brother was surprised, and said he would talk to her as that's not an appropriate reaction. My SIL interjected and said she was proud of Sarah for advocating for herself. She and I argued and she said that I was entitled for being surprised that Sarah asked for money.\n\nTo be clear, if I asked Sarah to babysit under normal circumstances, I would absolutely expect to pay her. It was unsettling that Sarah would bring up payment while, for all I knew, my husband was dying in a hospital on the other side of the country. I think it would've been more empathetic to bring up the topic of payment after I returned + confirmed my husband was okay. My SIL is still being cold with me, and so is my niece.

But the fact that the SIL praised her daughter for being a mercenary pretty much indicates why the kid is like that.", "NTA.  It was an emergency, a one-off thing, and the kid is family, ffs.

Sarah is a teenager and, really, all she did was ask for payment for babysitting.  Socially flawless?  No, but again, teenager.

My aunt refused to babysit my brother and I when our dad was possibly dying. This was 20 years ago. My mom's relationship with her never recovered. Niece needs to learn time and place to advocate for herself. Reddit likes to say we don't owe others anything, but you do. You owe them empathy if you expect to be part of a family unit.", "NTA - you were having a genuine emergency and honestly it feels a little bit cruel for a family member to bring up payment right that moment when you were trying to settle things so you could rush to be with your possibly-dying spouse. If my child had acted like that I would be ashamed at their lack of compassion. As for those saying \u201cfree labor\u201d, yes, of course niece should be compensated for helping out but you don\u2019t pay the ER doctor *before* the lifesaving emergency surgery.

I can only judge on my own personal opinion, so that's what I'm giving. In a time of crisis, I consider pretty much everything you ask for from your support network to be a \"favor\" with zero expected reciprocity, payment, etc. It's how I was raised, how I treat others, and how everyone in my support network treats me. \n\nIt sounds like you probably feel similarly to me, while your niece and SIL don't feel that emergencies/crises are any different than any other request. Though, I don't think it's fair to say you were being entitled. You were in a panic, and you were expecting family/friends to be focusing on your crisis with the same level of concern that you were...that's not entitlement, that's just a misalignment of expectations.", "NTA It is really upsetting that a family members response was to ask for money when your husband might be dying \n\nShe's 17 so you forgive it but who thinks that is the time (different if it was leaving him days and needing money for food but this is not necessity)\n\nI absolutely believe you would've paid after\n\nHaving lost people I have a clue where your head was", "I absolutely understand that people are not entitled to free services, but this was a FAMILY EMERGENCY? Where is the compassion and empathy? Obviously you don't have to provide free childcare, but this is an extreme case. NTA, and I hope your husband is doing better", "NTA.  The phrase that comes to mind is war profiteering.  When tragedy hits, some people respond with compassion and service.  Others respond with a chance to line pockets with profit.  Your niece is not \"wrong\" in requesting payment, but unfortunately her character has been revealed with her response.", "I understand that you feel that your niece's reaction was insensitive to your circumstances, but it's not unreasonable to be asked to be paid for labor. Whether you're in crisis or not, you're still asking her to work.\n\nIn fact, you believing that your emergency entitles you to free labor seems problematic to me. Did you expect the doctors and nurses at your husband's hospital to patch him up for free also? Did you expect the pilot flying you to your husband's side to do so for free? No. You paid them for their services. Why is your niece exempted from that?\n\nGentle YTA. I understand why you reacted that way in the heat of the moment but to continue to bear a grudge for a 17 year old negotiating the terms of a labor agreement is unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nNot the time, Sarah. Not the time at all.", "You\u2019re NTA, your niece sounds a little selfish, I would never feel good about asking for money in that kind of situation.

SMDH at all these y t as, y\u2019all are cold as ice", "NAH because you were understandably distraught, but gentle reminder: It is your responsibility to find child care for your child, even in an emergency, and that includes paying for it when needed. Also, she does this for work, so it makes sense she didn't want to give away her services for free (I know many family members that ask people that fix computers, for instance, to look at theirs for free). Would it have been nice if she did it for free being that it's an emergency? Sure, but she's not obligated to.", "NAH. You expected free care in the moment, and your niece expected to be compensated for her time.", "YTA.  I\u2019m sorry you found yourself in such a terrible and stressful bind.  But considering you would have *had* to pay an emergency sitter if all your contacts had fallen through, I don\u2019t think this is as unreasonable an ask as you\u2019re trying to argue.  Although honestly, this is the part that gets me:\n\n> I think it would've been more empathetic to bring up the topic of payment after I returned \n\nYou mean *after* she\u2019d already rendered services and couldn\u2019t do anything about it if you continued to insist you shouldn\u2019t be charged, let alone tried to argue (as most people would) she should have said something in advance if that was the expectation?  Yeah, no.  You didn\u2019t want to pay her rates, and fortunately, you didn\u2019t have to.  Move on and drop the shame campaign.", "You\u2019re a soft AH. I understand you were stressed out but I want to point out something. You said she asked for payment when for all you know your husband might \nbe dying, um NO the hospital told you he was stable. So don\u2019t make it sound worse than it was. Also YOU put her in a bad position because she shouldn\u2019t have to ask. It would be nice if she didn\u2019t charge you anything but in no way should you be mad or feel entitled not to pay someone who babysits regular FOR PAY any more than you are entitled to a free doctor when you are in an emergency. Would you ever expect the medical team to work for free because it was a crisis situation? Of course not. Do you think watching YOUR CHILD is a less important job? Of course not. Put it into perspective. Watching your son was very important. I wish you had just handed her cash without her even asking but absolutely do not be angry. I\u2019d also like to point out that she didn\u2019t say no, if you had said we will have to discuss it later, all she did was tell you what she normally charges. She was not being a jerk.", "YTA, doesn't matter what state your husband is in, you're entitled to nothing.", "NTA\n\nShe's family and it was an emergency situation. Totally inappropriate bc you were asking her as a family member not like \"a professional\"", "NTA - I'm surprised by the comments lol. Your niece is cold-blooded. This was an unexpected and serious family emergency and your niece's response was highly inappropriate and insensitive. If this wasn't a family emergency then yes it would be totally fine for your niece to ask for payment.\n\nI wouldn't make a further deal of it as it is not worth it. Focus on your family and help your husband make a full recovery. Your relationship with your niece is highly transactional and it seems like your sister-in-law has the same mindset.

Good for her for standing up for herself. \n\nI am sorry you had that happen and I hope your husband recovers well. \n\nI also hope you see that you are in the wrong here. That should have been you who said it first. You need her help and will reimburse her when you get back. Had you not assumed she should do this for free. You wouldn't be here now", "NAH. You were under duress and your niece is only 17. I agree with her mom that it is great she advocates for herself and I agree with you that it was untimely to ask for compensation but she's quite young and deserves a pass.", "I understand your hurt (and maybe a feeling of being taken advantage during a stressful time), but your niece babysits for living. This is her business, so to speak. If you\u2019ve called your regular babysitter (in case there is one), you would have offered to pay her - not only the regular wage, but a premium, because of the short notice.\n\nSo, while your hurt is understandable, I feel it is misplaced.", "I'm assuming when you booked that last-minute flight with the airline, they asked for payment even though it was an emergency, and you paid.  Why should Sarah's services be any different?\n\nCould Sarah have waited to discuss payment at a later time when you weren't so frenzied? Yes. But I think it's weird to hold a grudge against a teenager for this.\n\nYTA.", "Assuming you're in a good relationship with Sarah and her family, NTA. Friends and families do things for one another in times of crisis and payment should not come into the picture. Particularly if the favor only required a few hours of time AND it is something you are familiar with! Sure, there are exceptions - if Sarah would have had to miss work and couldn't afford to without being compensated, I can see how payment would come up even in a crisis. But if she could accommodate the request with no consequences, she should.\n\nThat being said, it's a gentle Y T A for Sarah. \n\n  I really don't understand the Y T A argument for OP tho. In unexpected times of CRISIS, can FAMILY really not be expected to do a favor for free? This is different to entitlement - there was no way OP could have seen this coming and she was probably freaking the fuck out.", "NAH, emotional situation for you and niece just heard \"work\" and was checking on pay. Don't be mad at a kid for looking out for themselves, likely no previously experience to rely on here in a tense situation. SIL is a bit of a piece of wood here, but I'd let sleeping dogs lie on this one. Hope everything works out for you, best of luck.", "YTA\n\nShe has probably been burned before by relatives that expect her to babysit for free.

That being said, you seem to expect things for free in return. It doesn't work that way. Your niece doesn't owe you free child care, ever, family or not. If someone wants to gift you time, money, items, that's their call, not yours. Yes, it's entitled to ask for free stuff. Time included. Sorry about your experience, but it doesn't give you a right to free childcare. \n\nThat being said, its surprising that you're still harping on about it. Your husband is fine, everything worked out, but this is still in your head enough to post on Reddit about it. Why?", "Lightly ESH\n\nNot saying you did expect it, but I can see how you might be viewed as expecting free childcare; which is AHish. Obviously the situation sucked and you were rightly worried about your husband, but your niece isn't obligated to do anything. \n\nYour niece sucks for bringing up payment in a family emergency, I agree she could have brought it up later, but you also could have offered to pay her for her time later after everything was resolved.\n\nYour SIL sucks for being mad about it. Sure setting boundaries is good, but maybe make the argument for it in a different situation. \n\nOverall, it could have been handled better but given the circumstances, I don't think you're outright the AH. Glad everything is okay!", "NAH. Only you can understand the emotional turmoil of that moment. A 17 year old CANNOT fathom that and would not know the right things to say or not say. To her, you were asking a professional babysitter for babysitting services. She doesn't have the life experience to make the nuanced distinction you expected her to make in that moment.\n\nYou are not the AH for being hurt that she looked at you and saw dollar signs instead of looking at you and seeing her aunt in absolute distress. That would hurt anyone and make them question their value to their niece. But again, you're talking about a teenager whose brain still believes that it is the center of the universe and who cannot fathom what you felt in that moment. All I glean from your niece's reaction is that you were probably holding it together better than you think you were.\n\nYou SIL is an AH. She's armchair quarterbacking without considering your emotional state at the moment you asked for help.

First, your husband was not \"dying in a hospital on the other side of the country.\" He was stable. Second, you should have said \"yes, of course\" when your niece asked about payment and gone off to do . . . whatever else you needed to do to get ready for your flight. Instead, you dropped your son off with a different friend (suggesting you weren't so hysterical that you couldn't make deliberate choices). ~~There's also the question of what kind of aunt you are to \"Sarah.\" (Note, this is not a question about your relationship to your brother and your sister\u2013in\u2013law, but your relationship with your niece.)~~\n\nNow we'll do your niece. Expecting payment for watching a child for three hours in a true emergency like you suffered is really not cool of her. Not cool at all. This is one of the few situations where \"family helps family\" is legitimate.\n\n**EDIT:** Given the clarifying comment by OP, I have changed my response. Given that Sarah is close to OP (close enough to come to her for advice or to rant about her parents), it's really shitty of Sarah to start asking about money. Should OP pay her or offer her some reward for stepping up? Yes, absolutely. But Sarah ought to have watched the three year old for those few hours. (No, it doesn't matter how rambunctious Max is. If Sarah is willing to put up with his rambunctiousness for pay, she can do it for a few hours to help her aunt.)", "NAH, but your niece probably contextually was immature about it.

I got a call one morning from his manager, informing me that my husband had been in a car accident and was in the hospital. He couldn't tell me much but said that although he was stable, it didn't look good and that I should come as soon as I can. I obviously freaked out. I booked a ticket just for myself, because it would be almost impossible to travel with Max, and I could barely afford the last-minute ticket for myself.\n\nI called my mom who lives a few hours away and asked her to come watch Max while I'm away. At this point, I needed someone to watch Max for the time it would take for my mom to arrive so I could make my flight. Looking back, I probably could've handled the logistics better than this, but I was hysterical and was just doing things as I thought of them.\n\nI called 3 friends - 1 didn't answer, and two were unable to help. Luckily, we live close to my brother and SIL, who have a daughter (17f), \"Sarah.\" We are very close with them. Sarah answered the door and said her parents were out. I explained the situation and asked if she'd watch Max for a couple hours until my mom came.\n\nI should note that Sarah babysits for a few local families and obviously charges them for her services. We have never asked Sarah to babysit before.\n\nShe showed some concern for my husband and when I asked her again, she said something along the lines of, \"well, you'll pay me, right? I usually charge X...\" I stared at her for a moment, not really expecting that response, and then my friend who didn't answer called me back and said of course she'd watch Max. So, I took Max and left without saying anything to my niece. I coordinated with my friend and my mom, then flew to see my husband. He ended up needing surgery, but is making a full recovery.\n\nA few days after he was able to fly home, we had dinner with my brother and SIL. We were talking about the accident, and I mentioned that I had asked Sarah to watch Max. I also noted that I was a little upset that she brought up payment in that moment. My brother was surprised, and said he would talk to her as that's not an appropriate reaction. My SIL interjected and said she was proud of Sarah for advocating for herself. She and I argued and she said that I was entitled for being surprised that Sarah asked for money.\n\nTo be clear, if I asked Sarah to babysit under normal circumstances, I would absolutely expect to pay her. It was unsettling that Sarah would bring up payment while, for all I knew, my husband was dying in a hospital on the other side of the country. I think it would've been more empathetic to bring up the topic of payment after I returned + confirmed my husband was okay. My SIL is still being cold with me, and so is my niece.

Most people would be upset because the expectation should have been set upfront.

Surely you can afford to pay her.  As an adult, the first thing I would have told her before she asked, was she would be paid her rate plus be given a small bonus for the short notice.

I think SIL is right in saying she's proud of her daughter advocating for herself, because in general yes, that's good. We've seen many posts here of family trying to take advantage of family, in this situation I personally think it wasn't necessary since she was only asking for a sitter until her mom arrived in a few hours, and only because it was an emergency.

I can understand how families normally step in for each other in times of emergency and she was willing to make the time right that minute to help. Her expecting to be paid for that time, while slightly irritating as a family member, is also reasonable. I would be more upset possibly about a sister, brother, or mother who did that, but a teenager doesn\u2019t surprise me at all.\n\nI also agree with the other comment that if she hadn\u2019t asked for payment, she\u2019d likely be arguing with you to pay her after the fact and your argument would likely be the same + that she didn\u2019t say she expected to be paid.

I'm also 17, and I've babysat for my aunt with 2 girls before, the oldest of which just recently turned 9 yrs old, and she's paid me every time, but in an emergency situation I wouldn't expect anything from her. Some people really take the whole \"you don't owe people anything\" shit too far. \"You don't owe people\" is for something like you not owing someone an explanation for why you don't want to go out with them, not family emergencies. I feel like you absolutely do owe your young cousin whose father was just injured a safe place for a little while without needing money as a motivator.", "NTA. Both your niece and SIL lack empathy and common decency. Asking for payment at that moment was completely inappropriate.", "NTA! thats a genuine emergency and not a constant thing. My dad had a friend who would pawn her child on me ALL the time. From ages 3-6. She would never pay me even when she said she would. So i started turning her down. This is very different though and I'm glad you and husband are ok.", "NTA. You were just trying to get childcare for your son in an emergency. You had every right to be upset with your niece but it is not her fault. She grew up in a family that is transactional and yours isn't. This is why your brother was mad at your niece while your SIL is mad at you. And why your friend was willing to watch your son for you. You now know that you cannot depend on your brother's family in an emergency unless they are paid. I think that your SIL and niece are upset with you because your brother told them off. But the important thing is that your husband is ok.", "NTA. This was an emergency, and it was not an appropriate time for her to ask for money. I agree, under normal circumstances, I would support her advocating for herself, but in this situation, I agree she should have waited until after you returned and she knew your husband was okay. \n\nThe fact that SIL and niece are being cold to you is just completely bonkers to me. I would limit contact with the both of them where you can, because they made it very clear they are entirely unwilling to help you in an emergency, so I wouldn\u2019t have any more of a relationship with them beyond being cordial at family events, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t be doing them any favors in the future.", "NTA. This is wild, I would watch an acquaintance's child in these circumstances. I babysat as a teen and I agree that family should not expect constant free child care. That said, you have every right to be hurt and alarmed that when you showed up on your family's doorstep in one of the worst moments of your life your niece tried to discuss babysitting  payment. Based on the title of the post I was 99% sure I was going to say Y T A, but this is in fact an edge case and you are firmly NTA.\n\nLast thing, even if your niece is immature and didn't understand that the generally good advice to \"discuss payment/expectations  upfront\" was not applicable here, your sister's reaction is really off the wall. If my kid did this, I would be talking to them about it and reminding them of our values as a family which includes helping each other in dire non manufactured emergencies.", "NTA. Your niece has a future as a venture capitalist, lawyer or politician. And obviously learned her empathic nature from her Mommy Dearest. I'm glad your husband will be OK, sorry you went through this and are dealing with your disturbed SIL and her offspring.", "NTA I swear no one cares about family these days. Obviously there are situation in which you should set boundaries but this was a literal emergency! Relationships are not always going to be equal, there\u2019s going to be compromise. That\u2019s the point of family. And the fact that knowing that this was a serious emergency and her first thought was money shows the type of person she really is. She\u2019s old enough to know better.", "NTA. Karma may come and get her when she needs help. I can recall a time when a family member expected to be paid in a. Emergancy situation. Well a bit down the road they had an emergency situation and needed a family member to help them out and they were all upset that they didn\u2019t get the free help.", "NTA. It is very cold to ask family for payment in a situation like that. After reading your SIL comments it is not hard to see where your niece gets it from. Today's world is becoming more and more selfish and your SIL is a prime example of that with all that \"advocating\" talk. Why do you even associate with them anymore?", "NTA. Your SIL and niece need a lesson in empathy. Your brother is right, it was not appropriate for Sarah to ask for payment when you are very clearly in the midst of an emergency. I would have been upset as well, but you did the right thing in going to your friend for care instead of your niece.", "NTA. I watch my brother and sister-in-law\u2018s kids all the time, four of those little monsters, overnight most of the time because they are just out for drinks and dinner with friends. I would never even consider asking for money. You could be a next-door neighbor I\u2019ve met twice and told me there was an emergency and I would never consider asking for money. She has some growing up to do.", "NTA, very inappropriate timing to ask someone about something like that", "Sarah is the entitled one, as is her mom.", "NTA. It was completely inappropriate in that moment for niece to ask for payment imo. It was an emergency, she\u2019s family.", "NTA on the basis that it was an emergency.", "NTA. This was an urgent all hands on deck type situation and it was really cold for the discussion of payment to be brought up. Hopefully your niece just wasn't fully grasping the seriousness of the situation and was having a self-focused teen moment. I assume she is not usually lacking empathy and unkind but given her mom's statement...eek!", "NTA. I feel so sorry for everyone on this thread who seemingly has no one they can count on in times of need.", "NTA. This is a teachable moment for your niece, who obviously doesn\u2019t have the maturity yet to understand why what she did is inappropriate. Hopefully as she grows up she\u2019ll develop greater awareness of propriety and become more empathetic.", "NTA -- as you mentioned if it were under regular circumstances you would've paid her however this was a serious emergency, it was very innapropriate for her to ask for payment she's well and truly old enough to know better. Glad to hear that you're husband will be okay.", "first of NTA, second if your husband is on a work related trip, and you need to fly out, his company should reimburse your expenses.", "NTA - your niece & SIL are TA - it was a family emergency she needs to learn to be helpful during family emergencies", "Or she could have simply said yes and been on her way to her possibly dying husband instead of worrying about a few dollars and then driving to the friends house to drop off. When she got back she could have used it as a learning experience for the niece about how it had made her feel", "NTA", "No christmas presents for her or her mom then. How horrible, sorry you had to go through that OP. NTA, now you know who your true family is.", "NTA\n\nSarah and the SIL sound like assholes for trying to take advantage during an emergency, (you said youd pay under normal circumstances, but when its a matter of life and death the family should step up at least a little.)\n\nAt the very least they could have had a *little* tact.", "I\u2019m surprised your niece and SIL didn\u2019t try to charge you \u201csurge pricing,\u201d due to your desperation.\n\nNTA at all.", "NTA. Anyone who puts money before family/friends (unless they\u2019re abusive) is automatically the AH.", "NTA", "Her reaction would be understandable if it was a common occurrence from OP. But that is not the case. \n\nNTA", "NTA, your niece was completely inappropriate", "NTA. My goodness how tone deaf.  Family should come first, especially family that from your descriptions, seems close!  Hope she doesn't need to pick anyone up from the hospital, she'll probably ask for gas money.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nThats the least they could do for you under the circumstances.\nBut if i were you, i would paid for it so i dont feel indebted to them, and in the future i wont do them any favors or ask for any kinds of favor, since they already show who they really are. \n\nGood to hear your spouse is ok", "NTA", "NTA since it was an emergency. How cold to expect family to pay you for helping out in a serious emergency.", "Based on the title, I completely expected up come in here and say that you were TA and that your niece doesn't owe you free babysitting. But for heaven's sake, you weren't looking to go have a spa day, this was an actual emergency, I can't imagine not just helping out in this case (family or not). NTA, but your SIL and niece have some really messed up priorities.", "NTA. It was a nerve-racking situation. You had explained to your niece she would watch your son until your mother arrived. Being upset is fine, but don't go burning any bridges since the relationship is probably awkward at the moment. \n\nAlthough your niece seems apathetic to mention payment, we don't know her story. Back in college, my best friend would occasionally have these drunken rants about being taken advantage of. Forced to babysit every day for relatives without compensation because they were family and had \"work-emergencies or health emergencies\". If your niece had similar experiences, it would make sense for your SIL to feel proud that her daughter was advocating for herself.\n\nAt the end of the day, no one can tell you how to feel. You are absolutely entitled to feel upset.", "NTA your sis in law and niece are absolutely in the wrong and good your brother agrees \nIt\u2019s crazy that your husband is the one that got in the accident and she has the audacity to give you the cold shoulder.  You don\u2019t pay family for doing the minimal right thing in a family emergency.  Wow .", "Her Lack of empathy is disturbing. She\u2019s made it very clear what\u2019s important to her. I disagree that it\u2019s her advocating for herself in this instance. This was an emergency involving family! Her first priority was getting paid not her uncle\u2019s well-being or yours. You know where you stand. \n\nNTA", "Reading the title I was so ready to say you were the asshole but noooope! I can\u2019t even IMAGINE my niece asking for money in an emergency. How absolutely callous of her and if I was her mother I would be embarrassed not proud. \nAdvocating for your worth is positive but this wasn\u2019t that. This was gross \nNTA at all", "Your brother sounds like a normal human, your SIL and niece are AH's. To only think of money before you leave in that moment is heartless. I get normal/everyday instances asking about the pay for childcare but not this emergency. I can't believe she did that. She's clearly her mother's daughter based on SIL's reaction. You're NTA but both of them are!", "INFO: What is your relationship like with your niece? Why has she never babysat for you before? Do you usually pay Max's baby-sitters? \n\nI am not close with my own aunt AT ALL, so I could see myself being reeeally taken back at this kind of request and being like, \"No problem, auntie. My normal rate is $20 an hour, fyi. Good luck with everything!\"\n\nLike, I don't actually consider my own aunt to be close family, so to me it wouldn't be a \"thing you just do for family.\" And I honestly wouldn't babysit an acquaintance's toddler for free.", "NTA. I was the same age as her with older brothers and young niblings. When my brother wanted a night out he payed me. In emergencies I was there no question and payment was not even close to the front of my mind.

The niece could have advocated for herself afterward or the next time she was asked to babysit. \n\nYes, generally teenagers are selfish. This imo isn'tbeing selfish.

YO GO FUCKING OUTSIDE AND BECOME A DECENT PERSON, SOCIAL MEDIA IS FUCKING YOU UP.", "NAH, \n\nAs someone who would be upset with there niece asked me for emergency babysitting money during a time crunch I believe there are no AH here. \n\nMy reasoning is as follows: \n\nYou neicd probably has no life experience worried about someone life or seeing people die, there is a noted tendency in those under 25 to kind of see death as an abstract \n\nThe interaction is probably colored a bit from the stress of the ongoing situation \n\nIf they have training in babysitting and still only a few years into it there could be a formula that was ingrained in there head of how they are to approach a babysitting request and they went on autopilot based on also being afraid in that moment \n\nTeens do tend to lack social graces and empathy when younger and tend to be a tad self absorbed \n\nFemales tend to be judged a lot more harshly for not reacting with the correct amount of empathy \n\nThere are also a few comments about how hard a time your 3 year old can have in new situations and your neice has never baby sat for you before so this is a new situation \n\nIt sounds like having an adult watch your child was the best option overall \n\nActually the more I think of it, it's not even the teenagers house and they may not have permission to bring the child into the home. It's not like you had the adults there giving there ok. \n\nYour neice has never heard you state under normal circumstances that you would pay from my understanding and this would have been new to them. \n\nI know when I have less money, all money conversations stressed me even more. \n\nI honestly think it is okay to be frustrated with the entirety of the way things went, as it was a geninely bad time. \n\nWould it have been nice if it all worked sure but you did nothing wrong in asking for help and not liking the restrictions and they did nothing wrong in having restriction. \n\nIf you continued to make this an issue instead of both of you learning from this moment then my statement would change.\n\nIt might feel weird and I know it was a rough time, it may be good to say to that family \" Hey, it was a rought time emotionally.

It was an emergency situation and the right answer would have been to take care of the child so you could go to your husband without worry. You weren\u2019t in your right mind and even admitted that logistically you went about things the wrong way. I think most people in your situation would have had the same response and not thought twice about needing to pay for emergency childcare, just because dying husband across the country has top thought priority. That doesn\u2019t mean that your niece is the asshole either. She is a teenager and probably yet doesn\u2019t understand how dire certain situations can be. It is good that she advocated for herself, she simply did it at the wrong time.", "NTA it was a emergency situation, the thought of someone asking for money in this situation is crazy to me. I understand if it was a emergency situation and you wanted to go out then yes you would need to pay but it seems your sil and niece have no empathy. It\u2019s good she stands up for herself in regards to her babysitting but in this situation she should be doing it out of the kindness of her heart not money.", "Teenagers can be ridiculously self centered.

I see some people saying you're not because if this wasn't an emergency you would have paid, but for her it's still a job emergency or not. But the biggest reason is because you got mad about it, you have to understand that she wants to make money, it's understandable you said no but not that you brought it up later with her parents. Seems childish to go around her back to \"tell on her\" what did you want from this anyways, for her to get punished?", "Your SIL is poison and does not understand the meaning of the word family. She is the reason behind Sarah's actions. Sarah is only acting according to how she was brought up by this vile woman.\n\nI remember when I was the same age as Sarah, a member of our close knit community, a mother of two kindergarten aged kids, fell suddenly and unexpectedly deathly ill and was in the hospital fighting for her life with her husband by her side. This left the kids unattended. They lived relatively close to us, but there was this other family with a girl my age that lived further away. They were closer to this family, so they asked if the girl could watch the kids. They had gotten them someone else to watch the kids overnight but this girl had to relieve them in the morning. So the girl stayed at my house that night. I gave her my bed and slept on the couch myself. My dad drove her over the next morning to babysit the kids. Oh, did I mention that was a school day and she had to skip classes to do this? And there was never even a question as to whether or not to do this. Asking for payment? That would have been monstrous under the circumstances. And that was not even family or close friends. Just another family from our community going through a terrible time, and we all rushed to their side.\n\nHard NTA, OP. Who can you rely on during a crisis, if not your family? I am glad at least your brother sees how wrong this was.", "If she\u2019s never babysat for you before and you never allowed or asked her until you absolutely needed her services as you know she is at least competent enough. It seems like you asked her because you were out of options, not as a family request, so I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say yeah, YTA for continuing to complain about it well after the fact and make a fuss with her mother. Should have just let it go and moved on as you never asked her for help before and didn\u2019t expect any kind of reimbursement for their time.", "For real. NTA. I was a teen when my grandfather unexpectedly passed. It was chaos at my gmas house as all the family had to travel in and while everyone got hotel rooms it was constant traffic coming in and out of her house, using the laundry, needing food to be out for people as they needed as things were being planned. I also got an allowance for doing chores at home, many of them similar to what I did there. I just stepped up and took responsibility for cleaning up, making sure peoples laundry was getting switched over, and making sure food was easy to get as people were coming and going constantly and NOT ONCE did I even think of asking for any sort of payment because it was family and everyone was doing what they needed to to help my Gma and get through it.", "Title made me think OP was an AH because kids should advocate for themselves and then \u2026 oh. \n\nIt\u2019s the lack of empathy here and trying to take advantage of a person in a bad situation that got me.

In this case, OP was asking for a favor from neicr in the capacity of a family member in an emergency not a professional babysitter.", "This is all I was thinking. NTA. I babysat for many family members, friends and for all kinds of animals growing up (getting paid for it) and my parents would\u2019ve been MORTIFIED and disappointed if they heard that I had reacted in any sort of way similar to Sarah in a parallel situation. If I REALLY did a favor and handled an emergency well I probably would\u2019ve been looking for some sort of monetary pat on the back WAY after the fact as an annoying and angsty teenager (even from my own parents). I just can\u2019t even imagine having the nerve at that age to \u201cadvocate\u201d (lol) for myself like Sarah did. I would\u2019ve been babysitting all the family members for free for a year if my dad heard about that. Oh boy.\nEdit- I\u2019m sure someone else has mentioned this already but It comes to mind the ONLY way I could see expectation of compensation up front in this situation would be if like\u2026 an adult who really needed the money for life and sustenance called out of a shift to help out and it was actually putting them in a bind, but yeah the kid is more important. Even then I can\u2019t imagine OP would\u2019ve overlooked that situation and failed to compensate. This 17 year old doesn\u2019t need $30 from her aunt in an emergency.", "Yeah\u2026 I watched my kid cousins for over a week for my aunt and uncle\u2019s vacation and didn\u2019t ask for payment at all, I just wanted my family to have a nice time\u2026 this is another level of messed up", "Agreed! I can\u2019t believe she actually chose that moment to be like \u2018so what am I making hourly?\u2019 \n\nSome people are completely deficient in empathy. A decent human being would have just watched the kid out of the goodness of their hearts without attaching a price tag to it, knowing it was an emergency.

I don't like kids but if my netting I've hardly said 10 words to said their husband was in an accident and they needed to fly to meet him I'd coordinate with them how to contact their mom and make sure the kid was safe for less than a \"thank you\".

She passed, but an older man in the waiting room who was just there with his dog for a regular visit saw us run in and saw how COVERED in blood my BIL was, and saw us being moved to like a \u201cgrieving room.\u201d He took the shirt off his own back and gave it to my BIL so he wasn\u2019t in a shirt dripping with blood. Sat in the office without a shirt on as we left. Obviously never asked for it back. I\u2019ll never forget that act of kindness, it made a big difference for both of us later on.", "Oh, I'm so sorry that that happened to you.

I\u2019m sure that woman never forgot your kindness \u2764\ufe0f", "I think the lines are blurred especially because niece does babysitting as a job. Might be different if you\u2019re asking your friends who do office jobs to babysit but asking a babysitter to babysit but then get surprised when they ask about payment? \n\nI think those are dimensions people are not considering because \u201cfamily\u201d.

Family is more likely to expect favors out of obligation. \n\nHow many times have we seen on here that if you don\u2019t negotiate payment before service is rendered that is on you if they don\u2019t want to pay after?"]}
