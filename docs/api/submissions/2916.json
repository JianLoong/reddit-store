I got a call one morning from his manager, informing me that my husband had been in a car accident and was in the hospital. He couldn't tell me much but said that although he was stable, it didn't look good and that I should come as soon as I can. I obviously freaked out. I booked a ticket just for myself, because it would be almost impossible to travel with Max, and I could barely afford the last-minute ticket for myself.\n\nI called my mom who lives a few hours away and asked her to come watch Max while I'm away. At this point, I needed someone to watch Max for the time it would take for my mom to arrive so I could make my flight. Looking back, I probably could've handled the logistics better than this, but I was hysterical and was just doing things as I thought of them.\n\nI called 3 friends - 1 didn't answer, and two were unable to help. Luckily, we live close to my brother and SIL, who have a daughter (17f), \"Sarah.\" We are very close with them. Sarah answered the door and said her parents were out. I explained the situation and asked if she'd watch Max for a couple hours until my mom came.\n\nI should note that Sarah babysits for a few local families and obviously charges them for her services. We have never asked Sarah to babysit before.\n\nShe showed some concern for my husband and when I asked her again, she said something along the lines of, \"well, you'll pay me, right? I usually charge X...\" I stared at her for a moment, not really expecting that response, and then my friend who didn't answer called me back and said of course she'd watch Max. So, I took Max and left without saying anything to my niece. I coordinated with my friend and my mom, then flew to see my husband. He ended up needing surgery, but is making a full recovery.\n\nA few days after he was able to fly home, we had dinner with my brother and SIL. We were talking about the accident, and I mentioned that I had asked Sarah to watch Max. I also noted that I was a little upset that she brought up payment in that moment. My brother was surprised, and said he would talk to her as that's not an appropriate reaction. My SIL interjected and said she was proud of Sarah for advocating for herself. She and I argued and she said that I was entitled for being surprised that Sarah asked for money.\n\nTo be clear, if I asked Sarah to babysit under normal circumstances, I would absolutely expect to pay her. It was unsettling that Sarah would bring up payment while, for all I knew, my husband was dying in a hospital on the other side of the country. I think it would've been more empathetic to bring up the topic of payment after I returned + confirmed my husband was okay. My SIL is still being cold with me, and so is my niece.

But the fact that the SIL praised her daughter for being a mercenary pretty much indicates why the kid is like that.", "NTA.  It was an emergency, a one-off thing, and the kid is family, ffs.

Sarah is a teenager and, really, all she did was ask for payment for babysitting.  Socially flawless?  No, but again, teenager.

My aunt refused to babysit my brother and I when our dad was possibly dying. This was 20 years ago. My mom's relationship with her never recovered. Niece needs to learn time and place to advocate for herself. Reddit likes to say we don't owe others anything, but you do. You owe them empathy if you expect to be part of a family unit.", "NTA - you were having a genuine emergency and honestly it feels a little bit cruel for a family member to bring up payment right that moment when you were trying to settle things so you could rush to be with your possibly-dying spouse. If my child had acted like that I would be ashamed at their lack of compassion. As for those saying \u201cfree labor\u201d, yes, of course niece should be compensated for helping out but you don\u2019t pay the ER doctor *before* the lifesaving emergency surgery.

I can only judge on my own personal opinion, so that's what I'm giving. In a time of crisis, I consider pretty much everything you ask for from your support network to be a \"favor\" with zero expected reciprocity, payment, etc. It's how I was raised, how I treat others, and how everyone in my support network treats me. \n\nIt sounds like you probably feel similarly to me, while your niece and SIL don't feel that emergencies/crises are any different than any other request. Though, I don't think it's fair to say you were being entitled. You were in a panic, and you were expecting family/friends to be focusing on your crisis with the same level of concern that you were...that's not entitlement, that's just a misalignment of expectations.", "NTA It is really upsetting that a family members response was to ask for money when your husband might be dying \n\nShe's 17 so you forgive it but who thinks that is the time (different if it was leaving him days and needing money for food but this is not necessity)\n\nI absolutely believe you would've paid after\n\nHaving lost people I have a clue where your head was", "I absolutely understand that people are not entitled to free services, but this was a FAMILY EMERGENCY? Where is the compassion and empathy? Obviously you don't have to provide free childcare, but this is an extreme case. NTA, and I hope your husband is doing better", "NTA.  The phrase that comes to mind is war profiteering.  When tragedy hits, some people respond with compassion and service.  Others respond with a chance to line pockets with profit.  Your niece is not \"wrong\" in requesting payment, but unfortunately her character has been revealed with her response.", "I understand that you feel that your niece's reaction was insensitive to your circumstances, but it's not unreasonable to be asked to be paid for labor. Whether you're in crisis or not, you're still asking her to work.\n\nIn fact, you believing that your emergency entitles you to free labor seems problematic to me. Did you expect the doctors and nurses at your husband's hospital to patch him up for free also? Did you expect the pilot flying you to your husband's side to do so for free? No. You paid them for their services. Why is your niece exempted from that?\n\nGentle YTA. I understand why you reacted that way in the heat of the moment but to continue to bear a grudge for a 17 year old negotiating the terms of a labor agreement is unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nNot the time, Sarah. Not the time at all.", "You\u2019re NTA, your niece sounds a little selfish, I would never feel good about asking for money in that kind of situation.

SMDH at all these y t as, y\u2019all are cold as ice", "NAH because you were understandably distraught, but gentle reminder: It is your responsibility to find child care for your child, even in an emergency, and that includes paying for it when needed. Also, she does this for work, so it makes sense she didn't want to give away her services for free (I know many family members that ask people that fix computers, for instance, to look at theirs for free). Would it have been nice if she did it for free being that it's an emergency? Sure, but she's not obligated to.", "NAH. You expected free care in the moment, and your niece expected to be compensated for her time.", "YTA.  I\u2019m sorry you found yourself in such a terrible and stressful bind.  But considering you would have *had* to pay an emergency sitter if all your contacts had fallen through, I don\u2019t think this is as unreasonable an ask as you\u2019re trying to argue.  Although honestly, this is the part that gets me:\n\n> I think it would've been more empathetic to bring up the topic of payment after I returned \n\nYou mean *after* she\u2019d already rendered services and couldn\u2019t do anything about it if you continued to insist you shouldn\u2019t be charged, let alone tried to argue (as most people would) she should have said something in advance if that was the expectation?  Yeah, no.  You didn\u2019t want to pay her rates, and fortunately, you didn\u2019t have to.  Move on and drop the shame campaign.", "You\u2019re a soft AH. I understand you were stressed out but I want to point out something. You said she asked for payment when for all you know your husband might \nbe dying, um NO the hospital told you he was stable. So don\u2019t make it sound worse than it was. Also YOU put her in a bad position because she shouldn\u2019t have to ask. It would be nice if she didn\u2019t charge you anything but in no way should you be mad or feel entitled not to pay someone who babysits regular FOR PAY any more than you are entitled to a free doctor when you are in an emergency. Would you ever expect the medical team to work for free because it was a crisis situation? Of course not. Do you think watching YOUR CHILD is a less important job? Of course not. Put it into perspective. Watching your son was very important. I wish you had just handed her cash without her even asking but absolutely do not be angry. I\u2019d also like to point out that she didn\u2019t say no, if you had said we will have to discuss it later, all she did was tell you what she normally charges. She was not being a jerk.", "YTA, doesn't matter what state your husband is in, you're entitled to nothing.", "NTA\n\nShe's family and it was an emergency situation. Totally inappropriate bc you were asking her as a family member not like \"a professional\"", "NTA - I'm surprised by the comments lol. Your niece is cold-blooded. This was an unexpected and serious family emergency and your niece's response was highly inappropriate and insensitive. If this wasn't a family emergency then yes it would be totally fine for your niece to ask for payment.\n\nI wouldn't make a further deal of it as it is not worth it. Focus on your family and help your husband make a full recovery. Your relationship with your niece is highly transactional and it seems like your sister-in-law has the same mindset.

Good for her for standing up for herself. \n\nI am sorry you had that happen and I hope your husband recovers well. \n\nI also hope you see that you are in the wrong here. That should have been you who said it first. You need her help and will reimburse her when you get back. Had you not assumed she should do this for free. You wouldn't be here now", "NAH. You were under duress and your niece is only 17. I agree with her mom that it is great she advocates for herself and I agree with you that it was untimely to ask for compensation but she's quite young and deserves a pass.", "I understand your hurt (and maybe a feeling of being taken advantage during a stressful time), but your niece babysits for living. This is her business, so to speak. If you\u2019ve called your regular babysitter (in case there is one), you would have offered to pay her - not only the regular wage, but a premium, because of the short notice.\n\nSo, while your hurt is understandable, I feel it is misplaced.", "I'm assuming when you booked that last-minute flight with the airline, they asked for payment even though it was an emergency, and you paid.  Why should Sarah's services be any different?\n\nCould Sarah have waited to discuss payment at a later time when you weren't so frenzied? Yes. But I think it's weird to hold a grudge against a teenager for this.\n\nYTA.", "Assuming you're in a good relationship with Sarah and her family, NTA. Friends and families do things for one another in times of crisis and payment should not come into the picture. Particularly if the favor only required a few hours of time AND it is something you are familiar with! Sure, there are exceptions - if Sarah would have had to miss work and couldn't afford to without being compensated, I can see how payment would come up even in a crisis. But if she could accommodate the request with no consequences, she should.\n\nThat being said, it's a gentle Y T A for Sarah. \n\n  I really don't understand the Y T A argument for OP tho. In unexpected times of CRISIS, can FAMILY really not be expected to do a favor for free? This is different to entitlement - there was no way OP could have seen this coming and she was probably freaking the fuck out.", "NAH, emotional situation for you and niece just heard \"work\" and was checking on pay. Don't be mad at a kid for looking out for themselves, likely no previously experience to rely on here in a tense situation. SIL is a bit of a piece of wood here, but I'd let sleeping dogs lie on this one. Hope everything works out for you, best of luck.", "YTA\n\nShe has probably been burned before by relatives that expect her to babysit for free.

That being said, you seem to expect things for free in return. It doesn't work that way. Your niece doesn't owe you free child care, ever, family or not. If someone wants to gift you time, money, items, that's their call, not yours. Yes, it's entitled to ask for free stuff. Time included. Sorry about your experience, but it doesn't give you a right to free childcare. \n\nThat being said, its surprising that you're still harping on about it. Your husband is fine, everything worked out, but this is still in your head enough to post on Reddit about it. Why?", "Lightly ESH\n\nNot saying you did expect it, but I can see how you might be viewed as expecting free childcare; which is AHish. Obviously the situation sucked and you were rightly worried about your husband, but your niece isn't obligated to do anything. \n\nYour niece sucks for bringing up payment in a family emergency, I agree she could have brought it up later, but you also could have offered to pay her for her time later after everything was resolved.\n\nYour SIL sucks for being mad about it. Sure setting boundaries is good, but maybe make the argument for it in a different situation. \n\nOverall, it could have been handled better but given the circumstances, I don't think you're outright the AH. Glad everything is okay!", "NAH. Only you can understand the emotional turmoil of that moment. A 17 year old CANNOT fathom that and would not know the right things to say or not say. To her, you were asking a professional babysitter for babysitting services. She doesn't have the life experience to make the nuanced distinction you expected her to make in that moment.\n\nYou are not the AH for being hurt that she looked at you and saw dollar signs instead of looking at you and seeing her aunt in absolute distress. That would hurt anyone and make them question their value to their niece. But again, you're talking about a teenager whose brain still believes that it is the center of the universe and who cannot fathom what you felt in that moment. All I glean from your niece's reaction is that you were probably holding it together better than you think you were.\n\nYou SIL is an AH. She's armchair quarterbacking without considering your emotional state at the moment you asked for help.

First, your husband was not \"dying in a hospital on the other side of the country.\" He was stable. Second, you should have said \"yes, of course\" when your niece asked about payment and gone off to do . . . whatever else you needed to do to get ready for your flight. Instead, you dropped your son off with a different friend (suggesting you weren't so hysterical that you couldn't make deliberate choices). ~~There's also the question of what kind of aunt you are to \"Sarah.\" (Note, this is not a question about your relationship to your brother and your sister\u2013in\u2013law, but your relationship with your niece.)~~\n\nNow we'll do your niece. Expecting payment for watching a child for three hours in a true emergency like you suffered is really not cool of her. Not cool at all. This is one of the few situations where \"family helps family\" is legitimate.\n\n**EDIT:** Given the clarifying comment by OP, I have changed my response. Given that Sarah is close to OP (close enough to come to her for advice or to rant about her parents), it's really shitty of Sarah to start asking about money. Should OP pay her or offer her some reward for stepping up? Yes, absolutely. But Sarah ought to have watched the three year old for those few hours. (No, it doesn't matter how rambunctious Max is. If Sarah is willing to put up with his rambunctiousness for pay, she can do it for a few hours to help her aunt.)", "NAH, but your niece probably contextually was immature about it.

I got a call one morning from his manager, informing me that my husband had been in a car accident and was in the hospital. He couldn't tell me much but said that although he was stable, it didn't look good and that I should come as soon as I can. I obviously freaked out. I booked a ticket just for myself, because it would be almost impossible to travel with Max, and I could barely afford the last-minute ticket for myself.\n\nI called my mom who lives a few hours away and asked her to come watch Max while I'm away. At this point, I needed someone to watch Max for the time it would take for my mom to arrive so I could make my flight. Looking back, I probably could've handled the logistics better than this, but I was hysterical and was just doing things as I thought of them.\n\nI called 3 friends - 1 didn't answer, and two were unable to help. Luckily, we live close to my brother and SIL, who have a daughter (17f), \"Sarah.\" We are very close with them. Sarah answered the door and said her parents were out. I explained the situation and asked if she'd watch Max for a couple hours until my mom came.\n\nI should note that Sarah babysits for a few local families and obviously charges them for her services. We have never asked Sarah to babysit before.\n\nShe showed some concern for my husband and when I asked her again, she said something along the lines of, \"well, you'll pay me, right? I usually charge X...\" I stared at her for a moment, not really expecting that response, and then my friend who didn't answer called me back and said of course she'd watch Max. So, I took Max and left without saying anything to my niece. I coordinated with my friend and my mom, then flew to see my husband. He ended up needing surgery, but is making a full recovery.\n\nA few days after he was able to fly home, we had dinner with my brother and SIL. We were talking about the accident, and I mentioned that I had asked Sarah to watch Max. I also noted that I was a little upset that she brought up payment in that moment. My brother was surprised, and said he would talk to her as that's not an appropriate reaction. My SIL interjected and said she was proud of Sarah for advocating for herself. She and I argued and she said that I was entitled for being surprised that Sarah asked for money.\n\nTo be clear, if I asked Sarah to babysit under normal circumstances, I would absolutely expect to pay her. It was unsettling that Sarah would bring up payment while, for all I knew, my husband was dying in a hospital on the other side of the country. I think it would've been more empathetic to bring up the topic of payment after I returned + confirmed my husband was okay. My SIL is still being cold with me, and so is my niece.

Surely you can afford to pay her.  As an adult, the first thing I would have told her before she asked, was she would be paid her rate plus be given a small bonus for the short notice.

I think SIL is right in saying she's proud of her daughter advocating for herself, because in general yes, that's good. We've seen many posts here of family trying to take advantage of family, in this situation I personally think it wasn't necessary since she was only asking for a sitter until her mom arrived in a few hours, and only because it was an emergency.

I can understand how families normally step in for each other in times of emergency and she was willing to make the time right that minute to help. Her expecting to be paid for that time, while slightly irritating as a family member, is also reasonable. I would be more upset possibly about a sister, brother, or mother who did that, but a teenager doesn\u2019t surprise me at all.\n\nI also agree with the other comment that if she hadn\u2019t asked for payment, she\u2019d likely be arguing with you to pay her after the fact and your argument would likely be the same + that she didn\u2019t say she expected to be paid.
