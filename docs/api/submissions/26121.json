The % you have suggested sounds more than fair. She's in a partnership, she needs to act like she is. How old are you both, was she like this before the move? (Did you always pay for dates, holidays etc) Early to mid 20s, it's probably just inexperience/naivety in relationships on both sides, all quite normal. Though it could be who she is, being so far away from loved makes it easier to control a partner. Maybe both write down what you want/expect and try to discuss in a calm manner. Late 20s she could be trying it on to see what she can get away with. 30s+ red flag. Shes old enough to understand how relationships work. I could be well wide of the mark, you could have set her up for this line of thinking over the years, there could be many other things at play in the relationship. I just have very negative response to any woman who says \"it's the manly thing to do\" all women experience the absolute bs that is gender stereotyping. To flip that to a man either means (in my opinion ) they lack basic intelligence and empathy or are as sexist/insecure/selfish as the men who say it to us. I can't stand men who want to pick and choose which elements of a modern woman and which elements of a traditional relationship they want (want sex/living together without marriage but except you to be a \"lady\") woman who do the same to men as just as bad and that's what she's done.

Anyone who wants to live with a woman needs to understand that she will have much less disposable income if expenses are split down the middle because she'll be paying a lot more for basics.  Women's haircuts cost a lot more than men's.  So does clothing and pretty much anything else designed for women.  Yet she will be expected by pretty much everyone (you, her boss and coworkers, her friends) to maintain certain standards as far as her appearance.\n\nI'm not saying that it's reasonable for her to expect you to pay for regular nail treatments and hair styling, but you should sit down with her and negotiate something fair.  I think most people would consider nail treatments to be a luxury, but a haircut at a decent (but not luxury) salon every seven - 10 weeks would be reasonable in my world.  \n\nYou should both sit down and make a budget.  I notice you didn't say exactly how MUCH she'll be paid now for her full-time job in comparison to you.  If she'll be getting less, then it would be fair for you to be paying more for living expenses.  She does have a point that she made a huge move for you and because of that, you should be open to doing what you can to make the move pleasant.  Maybe consider a nail treatment every few weeks if that's affordable where you live.\n\nIt never works if one person is living in luxury and the other person is struggling or feeling like it's impossible to save for the future.  So you do both need to take this issue seriously and work out something fair.  I know of couples where the woman spends all of the money on beauty treatments and money is a problem.  I also know of situations where the woman has no money to spare because the man doesn't understand or care that she has to pay a lot more for basics and still makes her split things down the middle.  The bottom line is that you guys need to sort this out now or it will become a problem.  Good luck.", "I'm flicking between nah and esh,\n\nPartly I understand why she views it as your responsibility but she also had the choice to stay where she was before the relocation, albeit at the risk of your relationship ending/turning to long distance\n\nBut on the 9ther hand I think that at the bare minimum she should atleast offer to pay some of the utilities now that she has been offered a higher paying position.

So you need to look at the amount of disposable income she has (the amount of money left after paying for necessities like rent).

She left everything behind to be with him, and yes, her reasons were absolutely manipulative, but honestly, she should have communicated better and actually thought well about how it's going to sound to him. He didn't force her to move, but her desire to be with him no matter what did.\n\nIf your basically soon to be spouse got a new job and you were in her shoes, probably feeling trapped in a new country, with basically no friends, probably a language barrier, and a brand new job and not having your own safety fund, would you feel like it would be fair to ask them to let you go back to normal life by working your new job, bringing back your own habits and favorite activities that you couldn't do before because you didn't want to burden your partner with your own expenses? Just a few months of having him pay the rent so that she could save up sounds reasonable to me. Idk, she's still going to have to pay 1/3 of the rent she's perfectly capable of paying in full with her new salary, but having that money saved up in case things go south sounds great. I'm not saying a year, I'm saying just like three months. She IS in a new country she didn't expect to have to move to, and she's just starting to make good money. \n\nShe should have thought her reasoning out better and communicated instead of manipulating, I absolutely agree. But it's important to also try to see this from her point of view.", "Add in the gender Role: \"Food is on the table the second I'm home, everything made from scratch and every Sunday it must be a roast\"\nAs a point to how stupid it is to say, \"but it's manly if you pay for it all'", "I see no semi-valid points.", "This is actually a really, really good point.", "He said it was but it was a fairly small amount. She's actually employed now and has more money", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe", "If she had to do all the womanly things, those manicures aren't going to last long.", "I applaud your response.  The sarcasm alone is just ...magnifique.  *chef's kiss* I believe is how it's put?\n\nNTA.  If your partner is going to be making good money than she can pony up.  If not she can move back where she came from.", "And she didnt have to. People acting like they dont have free will and choices here when you can say no.", "And he supported her when she could not support herself because of it. If a debt was owed, he paid it. At what point does she become responsible for herself again? Never?", "So now he has to subsidize her lifestyle indefinetely?? Is that seriously your argument?", "What a ridiculous comment. You sound a lot like OP's girlfriend. He didn't kidnap her and force her to move with him. He got a better job in a different country and she voluntarily chose to move there with him. The options were to go with him or end the relationship, and she chose the relationship over not moving to a different country. It kind of seems like OP making more money may have also played a part in her decision, but she's still the one who made the decision for herself.", "Yeah you\u2019re absolutely right - it\u2019s all in the way she used it", "She didn\u2019t ask for him to pay 2/3 of the rent for a few months to build a safety net, she said she wants him to go back to paying the FULL rent \u201cindefinitely.\u201d Which we all know damn well means forever. You\u2019re extending way too much grace here.", "You might be right. You are more trusting than I. I truly hope you are right.", "Really depends on what, if she gets apprentice wage then I wouldn\u2019t be making her pay rent, she need some for the food but also need some for her", "Go work on your relationship, you sound quite nasty and bitter.", "He makes 2x more than her and he wants her to pay like 1/3 of the rent. He also said in the replies she's making enough to comfortably pay the entire amount on her own. Considering this fact, I feel like 1/3 is absolutely reasonable. Sure she needs her own money but if she can pay it all and refuses to pay 1/3, that's not very nice of her. I, although, would talk about it with her because she did sound manipulative with her reasons, and offer her to pay rent on my own for like three to four months so that she can create her own safety fund, and get her to contribute then. She gave up a lot moving to another country just to not lose OP, and he has to take that into consideration, so this safety fund would also let her not feel trapped in the situation they've ended up in. But she can't make him pay all the rent for years, that's unfair.", "But how does it compare to your salary?", "Then yes she should pay her fair share"]}
