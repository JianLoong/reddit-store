The % you have suggested sounds more than fair. She's in a partnership, she needs to act like she is. How old are you both, was she like this before the move? (Did you always pay for dates, holidays etc) Early to mid 20s, it's probably just inexperience/naivety in relationships on both sides, all quite normal. Though it could be who she is, being so far away from loved makes it easier to control a partner. Maybe both write down what you want/expect and try to discuss in a calm manner. Late 20s she could be trying it on to see what she can get away with. 30s+ red flag. Shes old enough to understand how relationships work. I could be well wide of the mark, you could have set her up for this line of thinking over the years, there could be many other things at play in the relationship. I just have very negative response to any woman who says \"it's the manly thing to do\" all women experience the absolute bs that is gender stereotyping. To flip that to a man either means (in my opinion ) they lack basic intelligence and empathy or are as sexist/insecure/selfish as the men who say it to us. I can't stand men who want to pick and choose which elements of a modern woman and which elements of a traditional relationship they want (want sex/living together without marriage but except you to be a \"lady\") woman who do the same to men as just as bad and that's what she's done.

Anyone who wants to live with a woman needs to understand that she will have much less disposable income if expenses are split down the middle because she'll be paying a lot more for basics.  Women's haircuts cost a lot more than men's.  So does clothing and pretty much anything else designed for women.  Yet she will be expected by pretty much everyone (you, her boss and coworkers, her friends) to maintain certain standards as far as her appearance.\n\nI'm not saying that it's reasonable for her to expect you to pay for regular nail treatments and hair styling, but you should sit down with her and negotiate something fair.  I think most people would consider nail treatments to be a luxury, but a haircut at a decent (but not luxury) salon every seven - 10 weeks would be reasonable in my world.  \n\nYou should both sit down and make a budget.  I notice you didn't say exactly how MUCH she'll be paid now for her full-time job in comparison to you.  If she'll be getting less, then it would be fair for you to be paying more for living expenses.  She does have a point that she made a huge move for you and because of that, you should be open to doing what you can to make the move pleasant.  Maybe consider a nail treatment every few weeks if that's affordable where you live.\n\nIt never works if one person is living in luxury and the other person is struggling or feeling like it's impossible to save for the future.  So you do both need to take this issue seriously and work out something fair.  I know of couples where the woman spends all of the money on beauty treatments and money is a problem.  I also know of situations where the woman has no money to spare because the man doesn't understand or care that she has to pay a lot more for basics and still makes her split things down the middle.  The bottom line is that you guys need to sort this out now or it will become a problem.  Good luck.", "I'm flicking between nah and esh,\n\nPartly I understand why she views it as your responsibility but she also had the choice to stay where she was before the relocation, albeit at the risk of your relationship ending/turning to long distance\n\nBut on the 9ther hand I think that at the bare minimum she should atleast offer to pay some of the utilities now that she has been offered a higher paying position.

As much as it sucks, being an adult is paying rent.\n\nIf she didn't have op she'd be paying much more than he wants her to pay.", "NTA if you pay % for salary value.", "no seriously \ud83d\ude02 shorty really said \" yeah i get my face massaged and my husband buys himself food \" i'm stuck on how that's even remotely the same as self care or going half on rent ? \ud83d\ude2d", "20\u20ac both.", "Well, it sounds like you're doing your best to be fair.  \n\nThe plan to split the rent by percentage sounds promising.  One thing to consider though is that splitting by percentage only works if both people are making enough to cover necessities and also have some disposable income left over.\n\nWhat I mean is, if she'd have to pay $2000 per month in rent and other bills and would only have $50 left over after that, then she is not going to be happy.  So you need to look at the amount of disposable income she has (the amount of money left after paying for necessities like rent).  Is it enough to cover reasonable hair expenses and fun things like nails?\n\nLike I said, you guys are going to need to agree on what's reasonable.  If you can't do that together, I would see a counselor or financial advisor to work out an agreement.  You're in a serious relationship and it will be worth sorting out your finances so that finances aren't a source of stress in your relationship.", "So from my understanding we will just use simple numbers. By 5050 what you mean is.\n\nYou make 400\nShe makes 200\n\nYou contribute 200 to rent and she contributes 100 right?\n\nThis being 5050 you envisioned correct?", "[deleted]", "> She CHOSE to move with him. According to op she's making more then she was previously.\n\nNot relevant really. I could make 250euros a month in my fathers home country. And make 2000\u20ac per month in my home country with the exact same job. See my point?\n\n\nHe paid everything because she couldnt work yet on her level. She left everything behind. Its the least he could do for basicslly forcing them to uproot their life (lolol  chose to move with him, what was her other option, break up. Thats not a choice thats basically blackmail, \"or you do what I want or you can fuck off\").\n\nHes earning 2x her salary while she hasnt been able to do anything for herself since the day they moved. She for sure deserves to be able to save money and also have some fun. Especially since he can clearly afford to.\n\nBtw her comments about him being a man and that means he should pay would mean I would insta end the relationship lol. Fuck outta here with that shit.\n\n\nBut without that shes a 100% right.", "It's what he wants and costs the same (20\u20ac). I buy them on packs when they get discounted and he isn't interested in those. He goes to see scary movies alone too because he loves them. I did have to say the price of both I see. \n\nWhen we talked about this, that's what he wanted. He still prefers to have his spicy food over going to a spa or getting shitfaced.\n\nI bought this man socks and some among us parafernalia because he WANTED them. If I try to give him fancy things he would just never use them, but if I spend my day baking him a cake he would be over the moon. He is just anxious when it comes to ordinary life things, and he just prefers to live a very simple life, so a spa day would make him be on high alert all day. \n\nWe had our 10th anniversary together and his plan was to go to an italian restaurant and go home and play some  games and so we did. I love him dearly. I am going to make him a cheescake for my birthday, because for his bithday we couldn't get a fancy cheesecake due to our cats being sick.\n\nI get that it sounded uneven now, but you can get really cheap deals if you buy things in bulk.", "That's what I'm saying, yes", "We picked the apartment together.\n\nWe are NOT splitting it 50-50. That was never up for debate. We would be splitting it 65-35. So that way she pays half as much as me, since she earns half as much. That was always our agreement.", "Ok i fully understand where you are coming from, but here me out. Ask her to split it 70/30 for the time being. Than once she has a solid grasp of her job in say 6 months revisit a 60/40 and leave it at that. Allow her the freedom to explore the new country and start building saving while allowing her to do some stuff she has been missing. \n\nWhile it was her choice to leave everything behind to start a new life with you in a new country. She did pack everything up to do this as well. A relationship is never just 5050 like people say it is. So instead of focusing on the financial part focus on what you have together now. Is it really worth causing arguments over something petty? \n\nEither way good luck and hopefully it works out.", "Then I guess if she has issues with it now, she can put the $ into a plane ticket home. Once again: this is why having regular money conversations is so important. You two are obviously not on the same page.", "Finances are a huge deal and often lead people to break up.  They need to focus on finances."]}
