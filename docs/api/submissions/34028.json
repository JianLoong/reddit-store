He owes you big time. Make sure you get a proper lie-in tomorrow with no guilt tripping bullshit.

Then if you're feeling generous go turn about. \n\nWhy does he get to sleep through the night and until 9 am each day? That's ridiculous! At minimum you should take turns sleeping in, it's his family, he could be up helping....

I feel for ya. Sleep deprived and cramps suck. \n\nMid afternoon when you're both freshish, and the kids are being looked after by the in-laws, see if you can calmly talk about how lack of sleep can mess with you, and constant interrupted sleep results in the same. One parent doing nights and getting a few solid hours of sleep in the morning is a reasonable trade, but it's got to be uninterrupted. \nAnd you only asked for one day.

So HE will be in complete control of the home, and the baby on Saturday with NO assistance from you.     \n\\- and also , while you are gone, he gets to do 1/2 of the chores as per the list you give him, and he will also be expected to do half of the chores on a Sunday as well, because you're a fulltime plus OVERTIME mother 5 days a week, and he needs to pull his fair share of the family responsibilities on the weekend..   \n\n\n  \nI would also say that until he shows that he respects you and your contribution, and is adult enough to manage his \"sleep patterns \" to fulfill his part of the family chores, you won't be contributing to his awake time, so bed is STRICTLY for sleeping, and you'd rather sleep than \" sex him up \".. until further notice..   \n\n\nDid I mention he's a dead set asshole ?", "You are NTA but you husband is.\n\nSo he went to bed late hence only got three hours sleep knowing he'd have to get up earlier.
