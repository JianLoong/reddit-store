Sometimes this has been at 5am. He's given her my expressed milk, changed her nappy on the travel mat and left me to sleep.\n\nYour husband is doing a bad job of parenting. NTA", "NTA. He owes you big time. Make sure you get a proper lie-in tomorrow with no guilt tripping bullshit. If he doesn't ensure and even want this to happen for you , please ensure that he knows he is surplus to requirements as he clearly has nothing to contribute to your family and requires you to be available 24 hrs.", "NTA What the hell? He didn\u2019t let you sleep in at all! I\u2018d be furious snd demand another morning to sleep in.", "NTA.... but hubby is! \n\nSounds like he should get up tomorrow morning as well, and the rest of the trip until he can manage it without interrupting you.... Then if you're feeling generous go turn about. \n\nWhy does he get to sleep through the night and until 9 am each day? That's ridiculous! At minimum you should take turns sleeping in, it's his family, he could be up helping.... Anything after 6am is a sleep in, he can \"sleep in\" until 730, then continually harass him with questions until he gets up", "NTA. \n\nThis is why I stayed unmarried with no kids.", "NTA your husband needs to give his head a wobble!! Get him told!! And to remember he is a parent as well not the babysitter and he doesn't really want you to prove you can do this by yourself if needed!!", "NTA\n\nYou didn't feel well & wanted to sleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing with family during the holidays might have made him cranky because he was cranky with daughter too?", "NTA. I feel for ya. Sleep deprived and cramps suck. \n\nMid afternoon when you're both freshish, and the kids are being looked after by the in-laws, see if you can calmly talk about how lack of sleep can mess with you, and constant interrupted sleep results in the same. One parent doing nights and getting a few solid hours of sleep in the morning is a reasonable trade, but it's got to be uninterrupted. \nAnd you only asked for one day. If he can't see the problem, then he needs to understand the problem better.", "NTA. He sounds absolutely useless in this situation. I would be putrid if my husband behaved like this. \n\nHe knew he was getting up with the kids but stayed up way too late anyway. He should be able to look after his kids for a few hours on his own.", "NTA. So get me right: you are the one who gets up during the nights AND in the morning? What is your advantage in this relationship again? Sounds like you\u2019re a single mom of 2 plus an adult sized baby who can\u2019t live 3 hours by itself", "NTA    definitely..  \nI'm assuming Hubbster has a job that takes him out Mon - Friday - standard hours..  He's the asshole here, by a long shot!   \n\n\nCannot express how steamed I am about his arrogance, and uselessness :(   \n\n\nWhen you get home, I would turn around and say to him that CLEARLY his decent fathering and husbanding skills are eroded beyond belief, and from now on to retrain him back into worthy partner and decent father skills - you will - without fail    \n\\- be sleeping in every Saturday   \n\\- and when you wake up  - you will be heading off for the day - by yourself to attend to personal needs, shopping, and \" destressing\"    \n\\- and that while HE gets to work an 8 hour day, with zero responsibilities at home - YOU on the other hand, work from 6 am to 8 pm with a child in tow, and then pull double duty multiple times during the night..  So HE will be in complete control of the home, and the baby on Saturday with NO assistance from you.     \n\\- and also , while you are gone, he gets to do 1/2 of the chores as per the list you give him, and he will also be expected to do half of the chores on a Sunday as well, because you're a fulltime plus OVERTIME mother 5 days a week, and he needs to pull his fair share of the family responsibilities on the weekend..   \n\n\n  \nI would also say that until he shows that he respects you and your contribution, and is adult enough to manage his \"sleep patterns \" to fulfill his part of the family chores, you won't be contributing to his awake time, so bed is STRICTLY for sleeping, and you'd rather sleep than \" sex him up \".. until further notice..   \n\n\nDid I mention he's a dead set asshole ?", "You are NTA but you husband is.\n\nSo he went to bed late hence only got three hours sleep knowing he'd have to get up earlier.  I'd walk into the bedroom tomorrow morning and follow his play book and do exactly what he did to you.

I will revisit it again later in the day - the entire extended family are coming for a NY gathering.

I think there has been research about how we slip back into old patterns of behaviour around our parents if we're not in guard against it. \nNot an excuse by any means, but perhaps some context. \nTogether you got through this before (with baby #1); have faith that you will again.", "If it was me I'd be tempted to get tired and tearful around my MIL and let it slip that her precious son hasn't been pulling his weight.
