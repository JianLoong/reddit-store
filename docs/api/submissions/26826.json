It's just how my parents treated us. \n\nWhen Tammy was 13 she did something that she wasn't supposed to do, knew that she shouldn't do it, knew that our parents would punish her if she did, and tried to do it behind their backs. Well, because of her actions the garage caught on fire which then spread to the house. The smoke detectors went off and the fire department came so everyone was fine but the house was unlivable and a lot of sentimental items were lost. \n\nUnfortunately, there was a mistake with the monthly payment for homeowner's insurance so my parents didn't get much money, and we had to live in hotels and/or on the kindness of relatives and friends. My parents had to work crazy extra hours while looking for an affordable apartment and were furious with my sister. They didn't express all their anger but they made it known that they were not happy with Tammy. \n\nI got my own room in the apartment while Tammy had to sleep on an air mattress. I was allowed to keep one of my extracurricular activities while Tammy lost all of hers. I was trusted with a lot more freedom while Tammy was expected to come straight home after school and couldn't go anywhere one the weekends. Tammy often cried and begged for forgiveness and my parents response would just be \"what do we do with that?\" or \"tears doesn't equal cash.\" As soon as Tammy was legally able to work my parents expected her to in order to pay them back for the damage she caused, while they gave me an allowance. \n\nWe still celebrated Tammy's birthdays but mine were nicer and she knew better than to confront my parents about it because they would tell her that her birthday money was spent on paying back the people they borrowed from when they needed money to help pay for the damage she caused. \n\nMy parents helped me with college while Tammy was expected to figure it out on her own. I was angry at Tammy for a long time too but after seeking help with my struggles, I decided to start forgiving Tammy and we've had a few heart to hearts. Unfortunately, Tammy felt as if that meant I'd be her ally against our parents and I'm just not there yet. I was completely shocked when she called our parents out at family dinner and stayed silent when she looked at me for support. Our parents lashed out at her and she went crying to her room. I gave it a day and when I texted her to see how she was feeling she lashed out at me for \"relishing\" in being the Gold Child. I told her that it was wrong of her to do what she did without asking if I'd support her 100% first. AITA?

And I don\u2019t see that your parents punished themselves for their mistake. Your sister was a kid. Your parents gave no excuse for their behaviour and that you refuse to acknowledge it, yeah you suck too. Tammy should just ditch the lot of you, since you all mags her make her own way.", "Tammy was wrong for her actions. But your parents took her punishment way too far. I don't think her paying a portion of the damages back was wrong. But the different levels of birthdays and not paying for her college were awful choices. If you agreed with what your sister said, yes, you should have supported her. But I guess GC privilege is too good to give up. YTA.", "Boy, your parents suck.", "Jesus Christ.  13 year olds do stupid ass shit.  Your parents were well within their rights to be super pissed and enforce some punishment.  However, your parents fucking suck.  Awful.  You may have never asked for preferential treatment, but watching them treat your sister this way and never saying a word does indeed make **YTA**, and probably a de-facto only child once she leaves you all behind.  \n\n\"I'm just not there yet.\"  What the hell?  How much longer does she have to suffer and pay for this shit?  Disgusting.", "Soft YTA. Definite, strong, unforgivable YTA to your parents.\n\nLook, you're an adult now. What they did to your sister was unforgivable. I can only hope she will eventuallt recover. Obviously she made a huge, life shattering mistake *as a thirteen year old child.* But your parents technically also made a huge, life shattering mistake with their homeowners insurance. You don't specify what the mistake was that lead to them not getting more money, and I don't think it matters in the end, but they are being awfully liberal with the blame. \n\nI know it is hard because you got to see a different side of your parents and because your life was also made worse by your sister's mistake. But you should consider that maybe she got overly hopeful that she might have finally had a family member that cared about her, and got ahead of herself. You don't even need to have agreed with her to stand up for her. C'mon. \n\nEDIT: Not relevant to my judgement (I assume) but I'm curious why your 27F still lives with them? Do you as well? There's nothing wrong with that per se but if I would were your sister I would think I would *run.* But abusive relationships are never easy, especially when you have spent half of your life being told you are a worthless fuckup like your sister has.", "YTA\n\nYour sister has to endure years of abuse by her family because of a mistake she made as a child. You were part of that and know it but prefer to pretend it\u2019s okay because it benefits you. I wouldn\u2019t talk to any of you if I was Tammy", "YTA you might have not known well enough then but you are 30 years old now. What your parents did to your sister is unforgivable. What she did was bad but she made a mistake. It also wasn\u2019t her mistake that your family lost everything. It was your parents. They\u2019re the ones who messed up their insurance. House fires happen. Shitty but they happen. This little girl has spent the rest of her life rejected and neglected over a mistake she made at 13. I could understand maybe taking her college fund because I\u2019m assuming it would be the only thing big enough to help fix the mistake but everything else is just cruel. \n\n\nNeglecting her birthday parties and not allowing her extracurriculars was never going to be enough to make or break your parents getting out of that hole. It was all simple cruelty. So yes as a 30 year old woman you\u2019re an asshole for not defending your sister", "So you and your parents have been punishing Tammy for 14 years\u2026 YTA and so are they.", "YTA because you DO relish in it. You clearly told her you agreed with her, which finally gave her courage and then YOU played both sides. Didn\u2019t want to lose those good child privileges at 30, huh. \n\nDo you know who is responsible for a 13yo- THE PARENTS. They opted to not supervise their child, resulting in an accident. Or were you supposed to be watching her? And failed as the babysitter? Do you know who is responsible for maintaining bills & insurance- THE PARENTS, They lapsed on their own. \n\nThis life long punishment is absolutely disgusting. And you sat by and watched it happen\u2026 for over a decade. \nYTA x infinity. I hope all of her wishes come true and she leaves all of you gross people behind.", "YTA, you were a direct beneficiary of the abuse she suffered and in fact still are and clearly you do not want to let that go. It's also crazy you are trying to make yourself the victim, you had to get help to forgive her, she needs your permission to try and end her abuse.", "I wish the best for your sister. \nYou and your parents are the TA.\nAt this point they aren\u2019t punishing her but abusing her too.", "This is tough. I don\u2019t think you are a true golden child. She did something that had a MASSIVE effect on the family. Like, life altering. They didn\u2019t just decide to always favor you from day one. \n\nYour parents did in the long run handle this really badly but its also a bit much to expect you to fully have her back. \n\nI\u2019d say NTA for you but your parents are. I\u2019d recommend advocating for your sister.", "Info: why is Tammy still living with them? Is there a cultural aspect to it or something?\n\nI feel absolutely gutted for her and your parents sound horrible, so if she is trapped with them this is even more tragic for her.", "INFO: \n\n\"When Tammy was 13 she did something that she wasn't supposed to do, knew that she shouldn't do it, knew that our parents would punish her if she did, and tried to do it behind their backs. Well, because of her actions the garage caught on fire which then spread to the house.\"\n\nWhat did she do? Knew that her parents would punish her if she did?? Sounds like maybe lit some candles and it caught residual oil leaks/petrol fumes? Was this the actions of a devil child, or a young teenager with no concept of risk and danger?", "\u2026..oh my god, ew. YTA, and your parents are included in that. \n\nI sincerely hope Tammy leaves you all behind and goes on to realize that yeah, she was a dumb teenager, but she deserves love and compassion just as much as any other human because she definitely didn\u2019t get it from any of you.", "Will you guys have a funeral for her ?", "YTA and so is your parents", "MAJOR YTA. Both you and your parents.\nI hope the best happiness and love for Tammy.", "YTA. So a mistake she made at **thirteen** meant she was treated as a second class citizen by your parents for literally years, and you\u2019re just now coming to see that maybe, possibly your parents *might* be somewhat in the wrong here? Not to mention the minor detail that their error with the home insurance payment was a significant factor in the financial hardships that followed the fire\u2026.   \n\n\nTeenagers do stupid shit. There\u2019s nothing here to indicate that Tammy was malicious or out of control - just that she did something foolish, which unfortunately turned out to have significant consequences. Does that warrant punishment? Sure. But does it warrant sleeping on an air mattress, being banned from all extracurricular, being told that her birthday money had to go to repay debts, being forced to get a job to repay damages, and not being assisted with college? No. No, it does not. And at 30 years old, you\u2019ve had more than enough time to recognise how wrong your parents\u2019 behaviour was.", "Light YTA for you, but your parents are big AH.\n\nAdmittedly Tammy did a terrible thing as a CHILD, but it sounds like your parents weren't being responsible with their house insurance coverage either - have they acknowledged their part in your family's suffering? \n\nSecondly, they gave Tammy no reasonable way to make up for her mistake, they just kept moving those goalposts and lording it over her. First no bedroom for you, then your birthday parties suck, then no extracurricular, then pay us money from your job, and it continues. Along with continually making her feel like crap for her mistake. \n\nI think the whole lot of you need to sit down and work through this toxic pile of garbage. And you, in your coveted position as golden child, need to acknowledge that your sister has not been treated fairly. \n\nGiven the years of mistreatment, I wouldn't be surprised if Tammy goes low or no contact with people who appear to resent her existence.", "YTA. Tammy didn't mess up the insurance payments. The reality is, ultimately, you were in a bad financial situation b/c your parents gambled on house insurance. \n\nYeah, Tammy should have been punished, but appropriatly. Your parents abused her.", "YTA and so are your parents. \n\nyour sister endured a 14 year long punishment but you\u2019re just \u201cnot there yet\u201d when it comes to being an ally to her? not only did she have to pay the money back (understandable to an extent) but she also didn\u2019t get to enjoy the monetary benefits you did in college, has terrible birthdays in comparison, and was told her apology meant nothing because it wasn\u2019t money. how long are they planning on punishing her and how long are you planning of reaping the benefits of it?", "You are 30 years old and still sitting back and watching your parents abuse your sister, yes she did a stupid thing but she was a fucking child. 14 years of punishment and abuse for something she did when she was 13 is horrendous and you are just as bad as you parents for standing back and watching it happen, but I suppose as long as you were getting favoritism from your parents you didn't care what happened to your sister. You should be ashamed of yourself YTA", "OP enjoy being \"loved\" cause a 13yr screwed up. Makes me feel sad for you as a person.", "You and are parents are awful.  YTA \n\nYou still as an adult stand by and watch listen and allow their punishment of her.", "YTA - the fire doesn\u2019t seem to have affected you that much.  \nYou still got everything.  \nYour parents are abusive AHs.  \nTammy f***ed up and should have been punished but not to the extent your parents have.  \nMaybe if your parents had been responsible home owners there would not have been as much financial consequences.  \nTammy isn\u2019t at fault for your parents stupidity in not having enough insurance.", "YTA", "YTA and your parents are trash, utter trash to punish a 13 year old like that. Was she wrong? Yes. Were they stupid for not paying the insurance? Yes and they were adults. She was 13.\n\nYou aren't responsible for not supporting your sister while you were growing up as you were just a child, but you're 30 now. When you say it isn't something you actively lord over your sister it implies you're smug in the position. \n\nAt 30, it's time to figure out what kind of person you're going to be. Are you going to skate through life with preferential treatment, better birthdays, a college education and the entitled knowledge that your so much better than a 13 year old, or are you going to step up and point out to your parents that their behavior is gross, cruel and unacceptable as parents.\n\nYour sister's best bet is to go no contact with the lot of you. Honestly, I'm kind of horrified at the disgusting level of abuse your parents have rained down on your sister and your pathetic indifference.", "YTA. She was 13, was an accident, your parents failed to paid the insurance not her,and what decided to \"sentenced\" for the rest of her life, your parents are a couple of AH who have abuse your sister for years and you know and benefit for it, I sincerely hope karma take care of you and your parents.", "NAH because you have both had a rough time. I don't blame you for not being ready to support her in a confirmation when you've only just started working on your resentment, and I don't blame her for being understandably upset.\n\nYour parents are neglectful assholes though.", "You and your family are ah she made mistake she has paid over and over again she needs to leave you all", "IT'S BEEN 14 YEARS!
