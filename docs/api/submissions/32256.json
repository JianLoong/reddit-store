I've got a brother (m29) who's been married for a year, his wife being Hannah (f28). They've been together for a total of 3 years.\n\nA couple weeks ago, Hannah has given birth to their first child together. She's welcomed visitors but I have no intention on visiting her and their baby because I'm angry at her.\n\nI'm angry because a month ago, Hannah and my brother stayed at my place temporarily for a week. They were between rent leases and didn't have anywhere else to go in the meantime. I wasn't enthusiastic about them staying as my relationship with my brother has been complicated but I wanted to help them out.\n\nOn the day they arrived and on the day they left, Hannah had screamed at my daughter and berated her for very petty things. \n\nThe first was Ellie helped them bring their stuff into the house, and she left a pack of their soda bottles on the kitchen counter. They ended up being forgotten about until sort of dinner time and Hannah got all riled up because they weren't in the fridge and warm soda makes her feel sick. She did say sorry to Ellie afterwards but it didn't seem genuine and she just blamed it on her hormones.\n\nThe second time happened when I was at work. Ellie had eaten some fruit roll up snacks that were in the kitchen, which I do sometimes buy for her. These ones actually belonged to Hannah (which my daughter didn't realise) and she screamed at Ellie and made her cry, telling her she's useless and stupid. My brother tried to calm Hannah down and drove her to the store to buy some more of the snacks. Hannah never apologized for this and pretended as if nothing has happened.\n\nI confronted Hannah about this and she still hasn't apologized. She said that she's just heavily pregnant and on edge, and implied that my daughter has no manners and should've asked before eating the snacks.\n\nEllie is in the clingy teenager phase so she's told me everything about how she feels about this. She doesn't want to visit Hannah and the new baby and quite frankly neither do I. I can't really look at Hannah quite the same. I'd never scream at someone else's child the way she did, even when I was pregnant and especially for such small things, and I'm struggling to understand why she'd overreact so much and be so mean-spirited towards my daughter.\n\nMy brother has been asking why we haven't been over to visit and I explained to him it's because I'm upset at his wife's actions. He says I'm overreacting and babying my daughter. Our parents got themselves involved and told me I'm being a jerk and hurting everyone's feelings.

Ellie didn't break a priceless antique, she ate a fruit snack. It's not the end of the world.\n\nYou are not overreacting or babying Ellie. She shouldn't have gotten yelled at even once, let alone twice, and especially not over something so trivial.\n\nHas your sister-in-law always been prone to losing her temper like that, or was this a new occurrence?", "NTA\n\nYour SIL verbally abused your daughter TWICE whilst being in a guest in your home. She hasn't apologised for it, and will do it again if the opportunity arises. You are protecting your daughter by keeping them apart. Your daughter comes before your nibling in your priorities, always.\n\nTell your brother if he wants you to meet the baby, it will happen away from SIL, and you are fine if that's unacceptable to both of them and just won't meet the baby. I'd be incredibly concerned about how she will treat her own child if she is willing to jump straight to verbally abusing other people's children - I hope your brother has a plan for dealing with it if it starts happening.", "She stayed in your home and screamed at your daughter, calling her names like \"useless\" and \"stupid\"?

Your daughter was helping them out by bringing stuff in, its up to them to put it away imo, especially if you like to have it a certain way. \n\nAs for the snacks. It was an honest and easy mistake to make. There was no need to scream at Ellie to the point of tears over a snack that could be and was replaced easily. \n\nHeavily pregnant or not, her behaviour towards your daughter isn't excusable. You were doing them a favour by hosting them till their new place was ready, and they treated your daughter like she was a problem in her own home. Now they are surprised you're not fawning over their new baby? \n\nYou aren't babying her, you just don't want her to be spoken down to and respecting her decision not to go over. Your parents are only thinking about SIL/brothers feelings and not yours/Ellies. Why are Ellies hurt feelings ok but not theirs?", "NTA- hormones don\u2019t make you berate a teenager over soda and fruit roll up. Your monster SIL called your daughter stupid, and your daughter doesn\u2019t want to be around that verbal abuse again so thank you for sticking up for your daughter.\n\nI feel bad for your brothers baby that it has her as a mother & his enabling ass as a father.", "NTA. Your SIL is abusive, and your brother is enabling it. Their new baby is in for one hell of a childhood.\n\nAlso, what kind of adult gets upset over somebody eating one of their fruit rollups?

Embarrassing behavior all around.", "I don\u2019t visit people who call my daughter useless and stupid when they\u2019re too stupid to get lease/possession dates lined up, or too stupid to be gracious guests.", "NTA Will get some people pissed BUT you don\u2019t use pregnancy hormones to be shitty to anyone, especially a kid. \nYou don\u2019t really state if you want a relationship with the baby, as you don\u2019t really get along with your brother or your SIL.\nWould it be nice if this could happen? Of course. Do you even want it? Do they?", "NTA. You\u2019re hurting everyone\u2019s feelings?-does no one care that Hannah clearly hurt your daughters feelings for some silly things that shouldn\u2019t even matter? \n\nYeah hormones and pregnancy stress messes with you. But it\u2019s not an excuse to be a massive AH to a teenager who did nothing \u201cwrong\u201d. Oh no, get some ice for your room temp soda. Oh no, one whole fruit snack was eaten under the assumption it was fair game since they\u2019ve been in the house before. \n\nYour family and especially Hannah need to get over themselves. You helped them out when they needed it and made your daughter cry in her own home.", "How dare you keep their free babysitter away! NTA", "NTA! \n\n\u201cShe disrespected me, my daughter and my home that I generously opened up to them. It is extremely disrespectful and downright despicable to scream at any child and reduce them to tears, but especially in their own home for an action that is normal in my home. If you cannot understand that then I\u2019m afraid there must be something wrong with your morals.\u201d", "NTA. I am tired of people blaming plain bad behavior on pregnancy. You might be slightly shorter if you feel sick or in chronic pain, but to absolutely freak out on somebody else\u2019s kid is over the top.", "NTA. Your SIL sounds like a nightmare so I don't blame you or your daughter for not wanting to visit but I hope you can still have a relationship with your nibling.", "NTA. Your SIL was cruel to your daughter in her own home, over soda and fruit snacks. \n\nUntil she apologizes and acknowledges what she did was wrong, you have no reason to think she won\u2019t do it again. \n\nTell your family you are not going to potentially put your daughter in a position to be screamed at by an adult who isn\u2019t mature enough to understand why her behavior was wrong and apologize for it.", "That kid is doomed. Hormones my butt. NTA.", "NTA Your SIL may have been on edge due to pregnancy, but that doesn't mean she can act however she pleases and doesn't have to apologize or be responsible for her actions.\n\nAn apology from her would go a long way. She shouldn't have screamed at your daughter, calling her useless and stupid -- just for mistaking SIL's snacks for the ones you often buy for your daughter. Why can't SIL admit that and apologize? Why is wanting that too much or being upset at that behavior an overreaction?\n\nDon't let them reframe this as you \"being a jerk and hurting everyone's feelings.\" SIL behaved badly and all she has to do is apologize for it. Done and dusted. You are not going to allow screaming insults at your daughter over a trivial mistake to be seen as normal and acceptable behavior in the family. That's not how you are willing to have things be. Why do they want that?", "Good lord, NTA. Thank you for backing your daughter up and not making her accept mistreatment to appease unreasonable adults.", "NTA stand up for your daughter there\u2019s way to many parents on this damn app that already don\u2019t support their kids it\u2019s refreshing to see a mom stand up for her kid", "NTA thank you for supporting your daughter. That is unacceptable behavior for anyone.", "If someone did that to my daughter they would be out the door before they even realized they were. NTA", "NTA\nI'm heavily pregnant and SUPER sensitive and on edge..  Guess who I shout at?  Nobody. Your SIL is unbelievably arrogant to come stay in your house and shout at your child for, frankly, human behavior.

And to not lose their failsafe backup in case of any trouble. The brother and SIL should have known that they can\u2019t burn the village & expect them to be there in times of need.", "NTA and she (Hannah) has absolutely ruined her relationship with her niece. Hannah has proven that a fruit roll is more important than your daughter regardless of pregnancy and hormones. I wouldn\u2019t visit either but would be petty and send a gift that includes fruit roll ups.", "Hormones are not an excuse to mistreat your daughter.\n\nIf your SIL is not able to have some manners and at least trying to understand the situation, like instead of insulting your daughter and disrespecting her, SIl is not in position to request anything at all.\n\nPlus, in spite of the bad relationship you have with your brother you tried to help them out. \n\nYou did well for defending your daughter. Plus your daughter is innocent.\n\nJust because your SIL is part of the family does not mean you have any obligations at all to her.\n\n\nOp NTA", "Nta . Please don't say your daughter is on a clingy teenager phase it's demoralizing to her", "NTA. Next time kick them out, as soon as they started to get disrespectful  with me I would have let them go.

And neither time was justified.", "NTA.

She is 15\u2013and the relationship you are building right now is the beginning of the relationship that you will maintain throughout adulthood/the rest of her life. It\u2019s far more important that she know you have her back and that she can trust you with her problems than it is to visit an infant who hasn\u2019t achieved consciousness yet and its horrendously self-centered parents. During those tricky and sometimes dangerous late teen/early adulthood years, you want your kid to know she can rely on you and confide in you. \n\nYou also want to send the message to your brother and his wife that you will NOT be tolerating that kind of behavior.\n\nThey\u2019ll apologize or they won\u2019t, but don\u2019t back down. What matters most is the behavior you are modeling for your kid, not for them.", "NTA!\n\nAnd SIL gave you the perfect reason to not visit. She called your daughter names. There's your reason.\n\n\"Oh, after sister-in-law called my daughter useless and stupid, we got the message loud and clear. We would never want to inconvenience SIL with our uselessness and stupidity, it seemed very offensive to her and we would never want to inconvenience her like that again. We understand how difficult this must be for sister-in-law, so we'll be staying home to spare her from our uselessness and stupidity. Thank you so much for bringing it to our attention so that we don't inconvenience her again.\"\n\nLay it all at sister-in-law's feet, make it crystal clear that you are doing this for her, to honor her wishes, because you got the message loud and clear.\n\nIf they bring it up, you can just ask \"why would she want someone useless and stupid around? She made it clear she didn't, did she change her mind? Or is she ready to apologize? We're just really confused so until we get clarification we'll just sit it out.\"", "NTA I would go no contact with your SIL. She repaid your kindness by bullying your daughter. She sounds like a mean spirited person. An adult bullying a child is so cowardly. I would ask your parents why they are ok with your SIL mistreating their grandchild.

You may need to go low contact with them as well.", "Send your brother this post", "Calling your daughter \u201cuseless\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d crossed a line into verbal abuse.

Ask him, now that he is a new father, how he would feel if you, at some future date,  started screaming at his daughter because she mistook a snack in her own kitchen for something that was hers, not realizing that it was purchased by you as a guest in her home - and then you refused to apologize for making her cry, blaming your actions on hormones. He wouldn't like it one bit, and might even kick you out for such egregious behavior.  Especially if it wasn't the first time you'd done such a thing!\n\nYou need time and a little space. There's plenty of time to meet your niece when your anger at her mother isn't so fresh in your mind.

Why do they even have \"their groceries\" in this type of situation (esp. if they're squatting there and not paying rent)?\n\nTo further explain the point of #3... when we were younger, my sister liked a specific kind of Capri Sun drink. My uncle would always invite us over for these big parties he had, where he would barbecue and feed us (for free). My sister once got mad because our cousin drank one of 'her' drinks, and I had to explain to her that we are guests at this house (where my uncle and his step-daughter live), and our cousin could have been ***just as mad*** at my sister for eating 'her barbecue'.\n\nSimilarly, my partner and I get invited over to a rich lawyer friend's house fairly often. They (he and his doctor wife) grill up hotdogs and hamburgers (which are free), but if you want filet mignon... bring your own. Which seems fair. And everybody also brings their own beer/wine/alcohol. My partner has very specific beer tastes, and she brought that beer, and just put it in their fridge or cooler (I forget). Then she got mad when someone drank one of her beers... which weren't marked, and which 3-4 other people had brought. I told her she was going to have to 'write that one off' for the greater good, because we've already come out ***waaaay ahead*** on this whole deal.\n\n(and before anyone asks, I also do this all the time... it's only happened once or twice with her and her beer)", "NTA.

Also tell her that your job is to help Ellie learn how to take care of herself. One way to do that is to limit exposure to people that don't treat us well. That is why you are keeping some distance. Congratulate them on their baby and maybe even give a small baby gift. Show them that you can move past this and won't hold a grudge but will stay out of striking range unless there is some understanding of how you and Ellie should be treated. NTA for sure!", "why do parents in these situations just pretend everything is fine so often? NTA at all, everyone else is just being an apologist", "Nta - tell him how would he feel if you showed up and screamed at his newborn for crying?", "NTA Even if (and it's a big if) Hannah's emotions overwhelmed her and she reacted to relatively minor inconveniences by berating the one person in the house who wouldn't stand up to her, that doesn't excuse the lack of apology.

Explain to your parents that if Hannah wants a relationship with you, it has to start with treating your daughter like a person and a valuable member of the family.  \n\nIn the future, when they ask your daughter to babysit, if she agrees, please make sure they pay her and treat her well.", "The truth is always best.

Explain that you can not control those feelings right now and don't think it is fair to take them out on anyone.\nEveryone's feelings are important.

But being a reasonable human being, I rarely acted out because of it, and if I did, I apologized. And these rare acts of assholery certainly never included calling anyone, let alone a child, useless and stupid. \n\nSIL can get fucked, and so can anyone else telling OP that she's wrong. OP, you are doing exactly right sticking up for your daughter. Your daughter deserves an apology and I wouldn't engage with any of them until one is forthcoming. This is a hill to die on.", "NTA.

I've got a brother (m29) who's been married for a year, his wife being Hannah (f28). They've been together for a total of 3 years.\n\nA couple weeks ago, Hannah has given birth to their first child together. She's welcomed visitors but I have no intention on visiting her and their baby because I'm angry at her.\n\nI'm angry because a month ago, Hannah and my brother stayed at my place temporarily for a week. They were between rent leases and didn't have anywhere else to go in the meantime. I wasn't enthusiastic about them staying as my relationship with my brother has been complicated but I wanted to help them out.\n\nOn the day they arrived and on the day they left, Hannah had screamed at my daughter and berated her for very petty things. \n\nThe first was Ellie helped them bring their stuff into the house, and she left a pack of their soda bottles on the kitchen counter. They ended up being forgotten about until sort of dinner time and Hannah got all riled up because they weren't in the fridge and warm soda makes her feel sick. She did say sorry to Ellie afterwards but it didn't seem genuine and she just blamed it on her hormones.\n\nThe second time happened when I was at work. Ellie had eaten some fruit roll up snacks that were in the kitchen, which I do sometimes buy for her. These ones actually belonged to Hannah (which my daughter didn't realise) and she screamed at Ellie and made her cry, telling her she's useless and stupid. My brother tried to calm Hannah down and drove her to the store to buy some more of the snacks. Hannah never apologized for this and pretended as if nothing has happened.\n\nI confronted Hannah about this and she still hasn't apologized. She said that she's just heavily pregnant and on edge, and implied that my daughter has no manners and should've asked before eating the snacks.\n\nEllie is in the clingy teenager phase so she's told me everything about how she feels about this. She doesn't want to visit Hannah and the new baby and quite frankly neither do I. I can't really look at Hannah quite the same. I'd never scream at someone else's child the way she did, even when I was pregnant and especially for such small things, and I'm struggling to understand why she'd overreact so much and be so mean-spirited towards my daughter.\n\nMy brother has been asking why we haven't been over to visit and I explained to him it's because I'm upset at his wife's actions. He says I'm overreacting and babying my daughter. Our parents got themselves involved and told me I'm being a jerk and hurting everyone's feelings. Am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As an adult, Hannah should put her own drinks in the fridge, so that was her error and if she didn't want anyone to eat her snacks, WRITE YOUR NAME ON IT OR KEEP IT IN YOUR ROOM!

I didn't have much interaction with except at a party we all went to (we staff were all young women and friends and we often partied together). I met a very nice black guy and I invited him to the party. I was sitting on his lap as seating was limited and this woman walked up to me and made a very derogatory comment about his race. I snapped back at her rudeness. \n\nA few days later I went to a local convenience store in our building and she was purchasing a snack and coffee. She turned and saw me, picked up her items and told the woman \"OP will pay\" and she walked out. I paid for her stuff but saw her in the staff room shortly afterward and I told her that was not okay and to pay me back. She picked up a large knife and threatened me with it! I went immediately to our boss and reported what had happened. She said \"Well, she's pregnant so just forgive her\".

I explained that the outburst was out of character because I was pmsing like a bitch, but that was in no way an excuse to speak to him that way.

If she thought yelling was an appropriate response while pregnant, what's she going to do when she hasn't slept in weeks? When her kid's an asshole toddler doing asshole toddler things? When they turn into teens who snark back? This is not a person who should be around kids, imo.", "Thank you for calling it what it is, verbal abuse. OP needs to remind her family of the abuse every time it gets brought up, and tell them she's not willing to expose her child to her abuser, especially since SIL has made it obvious she sees nothing wrong with her behavior.", "Honestly I kind of think OP is an AH a little for not kicking this woman out the instant that second incident happened. Her poor daughter, and poor nibling honestly.", "SIL abused a child who was also a hostess in her own home. Calling someone, especially a child, \"stupid\" and \"useless\" is verbal abuse and cannot be tolerated. Ellie did nothing wrong and seemed to be trying to be helpful. Was she ever even thanked or given a hostess gift for any of her efforts? Or was she just verbally abused. I think the latter and that will be on her heart and mind for many years to come. That needs to be rectified and the abusers must apologize with deep sincerity.", "Been pregnant 3x. Never once have I screamed at anyone but especially a kid for an honest mistake. Have I been irrationally and out of proportionally angry at someone over something? Yep. But just because the hormones influence your feelings, you don\u2019t lose the logical part of your brain. You can\u2019t help how you  feel, but you can definitely still recognize \u201cthis is not a reasonable response to XYZ\u201d and act accordingly.", "[removed]", "Pregnant here. My hormones make me cry. They don\u2019t make me an AH.", "Just here to say pregnancy hormones sometimes made me an asshole BUT never to the point of yelling at a kid.

You still have to apologize for the harm your behavior caused.", "OP, come back and update us when they split up", "Exactly. NTA.\n\nSister-in-law fully was the asshole and she needs to fix that. Brother should be on OP\u2019s side, as should the rest of the family. Don\u2019t let them kowtow you, OP. Tell your lousy, cowardly bro that he should bring his child over to see you, leaving the poor wife home to rest. And make a solemn promise to him that you will not loudly and angrily yell at his baby about how dumb and useless it is when he brings it, because you\u2019re not a damn monster.", "Currently pregnant, definitely hormonal, and can confirm. That\u2019s not a pass for asshole behavior.", "I had rough pregnancies and cried a fair amount too. Small things felt life changing. Humans get cranky when they are tired, stressed, not feeling well, hormonal, and so forth. It can make it harder to be kind, but it doesn\u2019t make it ok to be mean to another person.", "I've totally had some asshole moments in my life where some combination of stress, hormones, and having been driven to the edge of my own self control came out in very embarrassing ways.  Forgiveness and the healthy kind of shame exist so that we can mend those moments.  The absence of humility and true apology tell us who they really are.", "Then it makes you wonder what is her excuse when she is not pregnant.  She is just a 1st class asshole.  Period", "Good point, and those kinds of statements can eat you up when you're a kid. Being called stupid and useless is one of the worst things I think that you can say to someone.

Grow up. Hormones are not an excuse to be an AH to anyone, especially *the child of the person who is hosting you!* \n\nHannah is a raging AH. OP is NTA. If Hannah got that upset at a teenager, who knows what she'll do to her own child when they do something she doesn't like. And before you claim \"hormones,\" pregnancy hormones had nothing to do with Hannah's abhorrent behavior. That woman (Hannah) needs therapy to get her anger issues under control.\n\nAlso, if someone screamed at you until you cried and kept screaming at you *over absolutely nothing,* would you ever want to see them again? What if it was your child? \n\nIf someone had screamed at my child (who is now an adult, btw) until they cried, I would never want to see them again, *especially if they were screaming over less then nothing.*", "Yeah, and if this is Hannah in \"guest mode\", I ahudder to think what she's like behind closed doors -- but likely OP's brother has seen some things.", "If you\u2019re staying rent-free at someone\u2019s home, any fruit roll-ups you bought at the grocery store are for everyone in the home.

I would like to contribute ice cube trays, please?", "I love you.", "And don\u2019t forget, this was whilst they were staying with OP and daughter because they needed their help.", "Definitely agree that hormones are not an excuse. Plus, Hannah was a GUEST whereas Ellie was in her own home and was yelled at multiple times. Not acceptable at all.", "The only ppl who forgive that behavior are ppl who have never been pregnant or are abusers themselves.", "My emotions were all over the place when I was pregnant with my eldest daughter. Major life disturbances tied in with rough pregnancy and pregnancy hormones made it a rough mental ride. That being said, it gave me ZERO \"excuse\" to be an asshole! I'm so tired of people saying someone couldn't help it because of hormonal imbalance. No, they couldn't help it because they never learned how to regulate their external emotional response! OP's SIL sounds like an asshole in general, and then using her pregnancy as an excuse to be an even bigger one! Then takes zero accountability for how her actions and words effect others. That's the other half of SIL issues. And her husband allowing it and supporting it? That just makes it worse. \n\nOP, I would let them know that you and your sweet daughter are going NC for awhile. While THEY think about their actions and how it effects other people. To the family that is defending the actions of the SIL, ask them to think about the situation from an unemotional point of view, and see if they'd be OK with anyone treating them or their kids that way at 15. If they continue to harass you about it, tell them you will become LC or NC with them if they keep pushing it. \n\nGood luck, and I hope you're able to repair the emotional and mental damage that nasty woman did to your daughter quickly.", "Yep. You can't control how hormones make you *feel*, but not every feeling and impulse needs to be *verbalized*. SIL is the AH whether or not she apologized afterwards.", "My longest time college roommate and I had a pact, and if I had ever gotten, I'd have insisted on it.  If we were in a bad mood, say something blew up during chemistry lab, we would tell the other person, I'm in a bad mood, it has nothing to do with you, and we'd talk about it later.

What I said was, women posting on reddit ALWAYS use hormones as an excuse for bad behavior, and suddenly you all think hormones shouldn't be used as an excuse.  That's being a hypocrite.\n\nWe don't know that she \"screamed\".  She may have raised her voice, but screamed?  I don't think so.  The OP is teaching her teen to hold a grudge.

There was NEVER any yelling, LOL, just stupid hormones.  I so LOVE my husband to this day, for pretending he understood how important it was to me.", "Yeah wtf? Women are damned if we do and damned if we don\u2019t. She is literally just asking that people do their job and telling them she doesn\u2019t want to goof around.

My aunt said the only time she could stand my mom was when she was pregnant, she was so happy. Hormones may very well be true here. But your daughter is owed an apology now that she isn't pregnant.

It\u2019s fair game for the teenager whose hormones are exploding.

Im in the same boat as you. With the last 2 pregnancies I also had HG and literally had lime 2 or 3 things that were same to eat/drink.
