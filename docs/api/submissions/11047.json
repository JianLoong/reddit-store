Traveling takes a lot out of you, especially if you have a fear of flying. I'm not great with flying as well and even after a 2 hour flight I usually take the rest of the day to recover.", "NTA \n\nIt's nothing wrong with wanting to rest at home after an exhausting flight. \n\nI understand that your parents want to have a chat with you too after being apart and driving you. But they should try to understand you too. You all could have met the day after and have a nice chat, nothing wrong with that either.", "NTA, you have a right to rest, especially after long flights, and it's not your problem if someone gets upset over it", "NTA, honestly that's odd to me that they're not even considering that you'd want/need the rest. You literally work the next day. A *few hours?* That's ridiculous after your flights, and again you literally work the next day. I feel like they aren't taking your well-being into consideration at all. \n\nNever feel like the asshole for putting your well-being over someone else's selfish wants. I say selfish, because if they weren't being selfish they either wouldn't have even suggested the visit, or at the very least would have had NO qualms over you turning down the visit.", "NTA! I can't believe they were angry about that. Geeze... I would think almost anyone could understand your need for a rest.", "NTA. Traveling is hard on you especially longer stretches and no one sleeps well on a plane. We always plan for the arrival day to be a rest day.", "NTA.\n\nI get that they're excited to see you, but come on - wanting to rest after a long/difficult trip is a given.", "NTA but your parents are the AH for expecting you to stay at chat after such a long trip home", "NTA I don't blame you for wanting to rest after the trip. Your parents just wanted to spend time with you. Perhaps you didn't explain yourself well? Let them know you'd come over in the next day or two and talk to them.", "NTA. You're just tired. Take some rest and tackle this once you're well rested.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to want to rest and unwind after stressful travel.  I'm sure your parents wanted to spend time with you/hear about your travel/whatever but they should have understood that you could have come over the next day or sometime soon after to catch up and share your adventures.  \n\nYour parents are only the tiniest bit TA because they decided rather than respect that you had valid reasons for wanting to go home and unwind after your trip they would act like *you* were being silly.", "NAH - you've had a long trip and are understandably tired.  Your loved ones haven't seen you in a while and are understandably excited to see you and were hoping to spend some time with you and hear about your adventures.", "Yes, you didn\u2019t arrange for an uber or other dispassionate transport back to your apartment. And since *you didn\u2019t have your keys*, you couldn\u2019t just leave your parents and *get* an uber and go straight home. \n\nI hope you fell asleep on their sofa. And snored. NTA\n\nOf course they missed you and were glad you are home. You can catch up with them after you get some sleep!", "NAH\n\nThe fact that you let them pick you up was probably understood as a sign you were willing to spend time with them. This situation is just a misunderstanding.", "Definitely NTA, but I don\u2019t think anyone in this situation is. Your parents love you and just missed you. I am also a dad and would probably seem a bit standoffish to my children in this situation as well. \n\nYou are perfectly within your rights to go straight home and rest after a long trip but just remember that those who missed you and love you want to hear all about your adventures when you\u2019re rested up!", "NAH they\u2019re just a bit butthurt you don\u2019t wanna spent time with them after time apart and them picking you up", "ESH. \n\nIf you\u2019re adult enough to travel, you are adult enough to take your house keys with you. \n\nIf you want someone to have a spare set for emergencies then get a spare set cut.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The first thing you need after a flight like that is a shower and plenty of rest. That's a matter of safety, especially if you have to drive to work the next day. Now, if your parents had told you that they made up the guest room/your old room for you, so you could have dinner and a shower and some sleep right away, especially if their place was much closer to the airport than yours, that would be different. But chatting? You would have been too tired to string two sentences together.", "NTA. My parents do the exact same stuff. They don't think about anyone else's personal situation except their own immediate one, even their children. Sometimes I get a butthurt, but they need to get over it.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA", "If you can fly somewhere on a plane, you'll be able to say, \"family, it was a horrible flight, I am knackered outta my mind, I will tell you about my adventures on the weekend but now I gotta go have a lie-down, because i am tired..\" Grow a set.\n\nEdited for clarity, hopefully\n\nNew edit cause I am an idiot and overlooked the last paragraph.

OP did tell them. That\u2019s why her dad was acting all upset.", "???", "hahahahahaha! *Yes*!", "Entitled, no, but OP could have just gotten an Uber and a key code lock, no more forced visiting.\n\nHell, even calling her folks first would have been a good move. \n\nWaiting until the airport to ask and complain is the AH move.", "OP's parents should not have been expecting them to want to sit and chat for a few hours after three layovers in the first place. It's common sense to expect someone fresh off a plane to want to go home and get sorted out first.", "I called them days ago to ask them to pick me up. It was also a given considering they had my keys and all.", "NTA but take care of your own keys and your own ride from now on obviously", "In that situation it would have been fair. \n\nIf you can't sleep on flights, and pick the most convoluted route on the planet, that's not their fault. \n\nBut you could have called them during one of your three stops and said \"hey, I'm already exhausted and have x hours to go, any chance you guys could bring along my keys, I'm ready to crash already! We can catch up next week.\"\n\nThese people are your parents, not some randos. One would hope you would know your own familial relationship to know they would want to catch up.\n\nYou throwing this at them when they've already driven all the way makes YTA.\n\nNext time call ahead. You had plenty of time between flights for a two second text/email and all airports have wifi.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re an adult and that this situation didn\u2019t revolve into the similar experience I had with my dad about this. \n\nYou do not owe them hours of your time after a long and tiring travel from overseas. You need your rest to be a functioning human & can tell them all about it when you are more well-rested.\n\nTheir reactions are NOT your responsibility. You should not prioritize their feelings or what they want from you over your rest & well-being.", "NTA. Inconsiderate to expect much of you when you are likely near asleep on your feet.", "I once picked up a friend from the airport after he flew NZ to UK. Thought I was being really nice and saving him the effort of getting a taxi. He looked disappointed to see me, cos he was just so knackered and didn\u2019t want to have to deal with people - he wasn\u2019t happy till I dropped him off at home and he got to see his wife and kids. Almost as if he prefers them to me! \n\nNow I\u2019ve done similar trips myself, I 100% understand how he was feeling!", "NTA - it makes me think your parents travel differently than you do, like maybe they don't do the three layovers situation and splash out the money to fly direct, or fly in better comfort than you did, and maybe they take the day(s) right afterward off... Either way, you and your dad will smooth things over, your dad wanted to hang- so hang! But after you've recovered from your jetlag.", "NTA for wanting to go home, but it's weird that you only have 1 set of keys. Most adults have spare keys and you should take a set with you when you travel in case whoever is picking you up can't make it"]}
