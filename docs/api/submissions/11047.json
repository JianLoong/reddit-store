Traveling takes a lot out of you, especially if you have a fear of flying. I'm not great with flying as well and even after a 2 hour flight I usually take the rest of the day to recover.", "NTA \n\nIt's nothing wrong with wanting to rest at home after an exhausting flight. \n\nI understand that your parents want to have a chat with you too after being apart and driving you. But they should try to understand you too. You all could have met the day after and have a nice chat, nothing wrong with that either.", "NTA, you have a right to rest, especially after long flights, and it's not your problem if someone gets upset over it", "NTA, honestly that's odd to me that they're not even considering that you'd want/need the rest. You literally work the next day. A *few hours?* That's ridiculous after your flights, and again you literally work the next day. I feel like they aren't taking your well-being into consideration at all. \n\nNever feel like the asshole for putting your well-being over someone else's selfish wants. I say selfish, because if they weren't being selfish they either wouldn't have even suggested the visit, or at the very least would have had NO qualms over you turning down the visit.", "NTA! I can't believe they were angry about that. Geeze... I would think almost anyone could understand your need for a rest.", "NTA. Traveling is hard on you especially longer stretches and no one sleeps well on a plane. We always plan for the arrival day to be a rest day.", "NTA.\n\nI get that they're excited to see you, but come on - wanting to rest after a long/difficult trip is a given.", "NTA but your parents are the AH for expecting you to stay at chat after such a long trip home", "NTA I don't blame you for wanting to rest after the trip. Your parents just wanted to spend time with you. Perhaps you didn't explain yourself well? Let them know you'd come over in the next day or two and talk to them.", "NTA. You're just tired. Take some rest and tackle this once you're well rested.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to want to rest and unwind after stressful travel.  I'm sure your parents wanted to spend time with you/hear about your travel/whatever but they should have understood that you could have come over the next day or sometime soon after to catch up and share your adventures.  \n\nYour parents are only the tiniest bit TA because they decided rather than respect that you had valid reasons for wanting to go home and unwind after your trip they would act like *you* were being silly.", "NAH - you've had a long trip and are understandably tired.  Your loved ones haven't seen you in a while and are understandably excited to see you and were hoping to spend some time with you and hear about your adventures.", "Yes, you didn\u2019t arrange for an uber or other dispassionate transport back to your apartment. And since *you didn\u2019t have your keys*, you couldn\u2019t just leave your parents and *get* an uber and go straight home. \n\nI hope you fell asleep on their sofa. And snored. NTA\n\nOf course they missed you and were glad you are home. You can catch up with them after you get some sleep!", "NAH\n\nThe fact that you let them pick you up was probably understood as a sign you were willing to spend time with them. This situation is just a misunderstanding.", "Definitely NTA, but I don\u2019t think anyone in this situation is. Your parents love you and just missed you. I am also a dad and would probably seem a bit standoffish to my children in this situation as well. \n\nYou are perfectly within your rights to go straight home and rest after a long trip but just remember that those who missed you and love you want to hear all about your adventures when you\u2019re rested up!", "NAH they\u2019re just a bit butthurt you don\u2019t wanna spent time with them after time apart and them picking you up", "ESH. \n\nIf you\u2019re adult enough to travel, you are adult enough to take your house keys with you. \n\nIf you want someone to have a spare set for emergencies then get a spare set cut.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The first thing you need after a flight like that is a shower and plenty of rest. That's a matter of safety, especially if you have to drive to work the next day. Now, if your parents had told you that they made up the guest room/your old room for you, so you could have dinner and a shower and some sleep right away, especially if their place was much closer to the airport than yours, that would be different. But chatting? You would have been too tired to string two sentences together.", "NTA. My parents do the exact same stuff. They don't think about anyone else's personal situation except their own immediate one, even their children. Sometimes I get a butthurt, but they need to get over it.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA", "If you can fly somewhere on a plane, you'll be able to say, \"family, it was a horrible flight, I am knackered outta my mind, I will tell you about my adventures on the weekend but now I gotta go have a lie-down, because i am tired..\" Grow a set.\n\nEdited for clarity, hopefully\n\nNew edit cause I am an idiot and overlooked the last paragraph.

OP did tell them. That\u2019s why her dad was acting all upset.", "???", "hahahahahaha! *Yes*!", "Entitled, no, but OP could have just gotten an Uber and a key code lock, no more forced visiting.\n\nHell, even calling her folks first would have been a good move. \n\nWaiting until the airport to ask and complain is the AH move.", "OP's parents should not have been expecting them to want to sit and chat for a few hours after three layovers in the first place. It's common sense to expect someone fresh off a plane to want to go home and get sorted out first.", "I called them days ago to ask them to pick me up. It was also a given considering they had my keys and all.", "NTA but take care of your own keys and your own ride from now on obviously", "In that situation it would have been fair. \n\nIf you can't sleep on flights, and pick the most convoluted route on the planet, that's not their fault. \n\nBut you could have called them during one of your three stops and said \"hey, I'm already exhausted and have x hours to go, any chance you guys could bring along my keys, I'm ready to crash already! We can catch up next week.\"\n\nThese people are your parents, not some randos. One would hope you would know your own familial relationship to know they would want to catch up.\n\nYou throwing this at them when they've already driven all the way makes YTA.\n\nNext time call ahead. You had plenty of time between flights for a two second text/email and all airports have wifi.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re an adult and that this situation didn\u2019t revolve into the similar experience I had with my dad about this. \n\nYou do not owe them hours of your time after a long and tiring travel from overseas. You need your rest to be a functioning human & can tell them all about it when you are more well-rested.\n\nTheir reactions are NOT your responsibility. You should not prioritize their feelings or what they want from you over your rest & well-being.", "NTA. Inconsiderate to expect much of you when you are likely near asleep on your feet.", "I once picked up a friend from the airport after he flew NZ to UK. Thought I was being really nice and saving him the effort of getting a taxi. He looked disappointed to see me, cos he was just so knackered and didn\u2019t want to have to deal with people - he wasn\u2019t happy till I dropped him off at home and he got to see his wife and kids. Almost as if he prefers them to me! \n\nNow I\u2019ve done similar trips myself, I 100% understand how he was feeling!", "NTA - it makes me think your parents travel differently than you do, like maybe they don't do the three layovers situation and splash out the money to fly direct, or fly in better comfort than you did, and maybe they take the day(s) right afterward off... Either way, you and your dad will smooth things over, your dad wanted to hang- so hang! But after you've recovered from your jetlag.", "NTA for wanting to go home, but it's weird that you only have 1 set of keys. Most adults have spare keys and you should take a set with you when you travel in case whoever is picking you up can't make it", "INFO\n\n> My family came to pick me up\n\nWhy did you arrange for your family to pick you up if you *didn't* want to see them? Like, fucking hell, rideshares are the default these days. \n\n> Before I left, I gave my apartment keys to my parents for safe keeping.\n\nWould they not have been safe *with you*?", "NTA Your parents must not fly a lot, hence do not understand jetlag", "NTA but people who don't travel much don't understand how draining it is. I give advance warning to relatives or whoever is picking me uyp that I am 100% not doing anything except going straight home and sleeping. If you fail to do that, people will want to visit with you, take you out for dinner, do stuff, etc.", "I can so relate! Just got off a 16 hour flight (with an extra hour on the runway because someone had an emergency) and the only thing I wanted was a shower and my bed. \n\nI sent a text to let my daughter know I was home safe and she responded with I love you and call me after you get some sleep. It's not rocket science, travel and the flight home are exhausting!!\n\nNTA", "NTA, my parents do the same. God forbid you\u2019re tired and exhausted of have work at 5:30am the next day \ud83d\ude10", "NTA\n\nYour dad is an adult. Hopefully he can get over himself and realize that you were exhausted. \n\nYou are not an asshole for wanting rest after a long trip.", "NAH\n\nSome people actually really like this or feel keyed up after a trip and want to hang out, so they're not AHs for offering.\n\nYou resolve this by ignoring the weirdness. Then thanking them profusely, claiming utter exhaustion and jet lag brain fog, and asking to come over in the next day or so at dinner time and do whatever the modern equivalent is of a vacation slide show, and distribute whatever souvenirs you got them.", "NTA. Even if it hadn't been an international flight, you don't owe them an immediate debrief.", "NTA. That was really presumptuous of them. Going forward, I\u2019d suggest taking an Uber back.", ">Why did you arrange for your family to pick you up\n\nThey had my keys and they offered to.\n\n>Would they not have been safe with you?\n\nI assumed they wouldn't have, but I see now they would have. I'm going to bring them next time.", "why would they not assume that works happen at op's house?", "NAH. You are not an AH, but neither is your family. People have different amounts of energy, asking about it is not a big deal. Maybe, maybe your father pouting could drift him into AH territory, but I don't think so.", "NTA everyone should know the person flying doesn't want to do ANYTHING but sleep or rest", "Now you know why most parents teach their kids to always have their key. The others are controlling and manipulative and will use it to their benefit.", "NTA OP.  When I flew out here to be with the man who is now my husband, I was coming from sea level to mile high, so by the time we got back to his family\u2019s home, I was conscious just long enough to meet his parents, call my dad, and put my husband on the phone before passing out cold.", "NTA\nYou are exhausted and depleted. Whether dad understands that or not. You deserve to rest. Good luck.", "NAH. \n\nYou aren\u2019t an AH for wanting to go home but extremely weird to not hold onto your own keys\u2026?\n\nBasically you asked them to pick you up; that usually suggests you\u2019ll share a meal or something before going right home but I would be the same, I\u2019d want to go straight home. \n\nBut. \n\nYou, an adult, had them hold onto your keys? And then expected them to bring them to you, while also picking you up. \n\nYou needed to just tell them what you needed, proactively.", "Your family missed you and was excited to see you again. How often do you see your parents?\n\nNTA for going straight back to your place but give them a visit soon. They probably thought that by picking you up from the airport, it would give them a chance to spend more quality time with you", "NTA. Your train of thought is completely understandable. Have your parents perhaps never traveled long distances before?", "NTA. I bet he was a bit dissapointed hoping to see you. But he also needs to realize you were really tired from such a flight. So in this I think that in this case he should've swallowed the dissapointment and make an appointment to meet up and do vacation talk. \"Sure X, how about you send me a message to meet up and tell us about your holiday\". That's all it took if you ask me, that one sentence.", "this.\n\nI get worn out just picking someone up from the airport", "agree with you", "They said I should leave my keys with them. Shouldn't have listened to them.", "We live 30 minutes apart so about once a week.", "Yeah. I think NAH but I do think you behaved foolishly. I mean, that\u2019s 2 favors, one of which is not a favor most adults would ask of their parents (keys). I don\u2019t really fault them for assuming you wouldn\u2019t be returning straight home after they picked you up.", "Bring them a gift to thank them for picking you up at the airport. You're not apologizing because you have nothing to apologize for, but it's a nice gesture to let them know you appreciate them", ">but I don\u2019t think anyone in this situation is.\n\nBest vote for it would be NAH (No Asshole Here).", "Ha! Didn\u2019t know that was an option. TIL", "NTA", "NTA. Traveling, with or without challenges like anxiety, etc, is EXHAUSTING. I\u2019m sorry your dad has taken it personally, but you\u2019ve done nothing wrong.", "Why should OP call ahead? Their decision to go home should have been respected without any fuss despite it not being what their parents wanted. Or should we excuse the fact that dad is stomping his foot and huffing like a child because OP said no?", "NTA your parents are very inconsiderate of you time it seems like.. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it because believe me they will speak about your \u201cslight\u201d to them when they can\u2019t take it anymore, because they think they are right in this. Make sure you stay calm and explain how long of a trip you had and how tired you were at the time. Next time make other arrangements for your keys", "NTA. You have completed a major personal milestone in traveling to a foreign country all by yourself. Your family may be being unreasonable in expecting you to feel fresh after the layovers, time differences, and jet lag. But it reads like you're assuming your father is offended. Ask! Bring out whatever may be bothering your father into the open. Then explain why you are too tired to sit and chat, especially if you're expected to return to your job the next day.", "NTA. That sounds like it would be an exhausting trip without the fear of flying. With the fear of flying you probably felt ready to fall over. I think it would be common sense that you would want rest when you got home. Do your parents normally have any?\n\nNext time, just give them a copy of your key and take a cab home.", "It's also common sense that if you have no intention of going back to someone's place you show them a little respect and call them to ask them to bring the keys along, saving them a complete trip.  Their time matters too, I'm sure they didn't plan on driving back and forth and back and forth all at once.\n\nThat way this situation wouldn't have even happened, because their expectations would have been known, and they wouldn't waste all that time going back to get the keys and then going straight to OP and then back home.", "Well one, then their parents wouldn't have had to go all the way to the airport, all the way back home, get the keys, and then taxi OP all the way home, and then go home again.\n\nThat's just disrespectful. \n\nI'd be pretty fucking pissed. OP could have been less of a child and just called to ask them to bring the keys. Not a big deal."]}
