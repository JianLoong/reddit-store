{"id": 25230, "submission_id": "15xy5nb", "title": "AITA for expressing sadness over my cousin choosing an acquaintance's wedding over mine just because it was more \"fun\" ?", "selftext": "Hi this is my first reddit post so please ignore if I make any mistakes.\n\nSo, I (29f) got married November of last year. we are Indian and I do not have a large family as per Indian standards and hence the guest list in my wedding was pretty limited. \n\nAbout 18 months before my wedding my only female cousin (27f) who I have grown up with, let's call her Sara, had travelled to Belgium to study. When my wedding date was finalised my aunt told my mom that Sara won't be attending as she can not afford plane tickets. It was hard for any of us to digest money being the only issue as her family is REALLY rich and she is super pampered but we accepted the reason without any complaints. \n\nMy wedding preparations went on for almost a year and she never even called or texted me. Aunt always said that she is too busy studying but is always asking her about the preparations. Wedding came and I even gave the bridal party gift packet for Sara to Sara's mom as I figured she would have been in my bridal party if she would have been in India. My wedding got over, months passed and I never heard from her except for a congratulations comment on my social media post. \n\nFew months later I find out Sara had travelled to India and attended the wedding of her friend's brother that happened just few days post my wedding. That was a destination wedding and She was staying with her friend's family, helped them with preparations, went on a bachelor's trip with the groom, his sister and friends, and even stayed for few days post the wedding (Indian wedding festivities continue post wedding day). My aunt knew all about this.\n\nHer choosing her friend's brother's (whom she hardly knew prior to wedding) wedding over mine (someone who she has grown up with as practically siblings) hurt me and I told another cousin (31m) about this and also said that I am thinking not to attend Sara's wedding which will happen next year. My cousin promptly tattled to everyone and now am being called selfish for creating a fuss.\n\nI never complained to Sara or my aunt and have always been cordial to them. My aunt even said that Sara chose her friend because it was a destination wedding and hence she obviously had more fun there while my wedding was way too simple for a young person to enjoy. Other relatives are also saying that I am older and married now and hence should act mature and understand why a student would use her vacation time for a fun wedding over mine. Moreover I should stop being petty and not only attend Sara's wedding but also help out as older sister.\n\nAm i really being unreasonable and AITA?\n\nUpdate: Some asked if I had talked to Sara, well I tried by calling her last weekend but she was out with her friends and hence the reception was not great. She said she will call me back but it's been two days with no call. \n\nAlso, forgot to mention I am a trained dancer and have always choreographed performances for all kinds of family functions (dance performances are huge highlights in Indian functions, weddings have a separate dance night with choreographed performances by everyone) hence my aunt and Sara were expecting me to choreograph some dance performances for Sara's wedding. \n\nSo of course if I don't attend that also means I will neither be choreographing nor be helping with any other preparations. Relatives are also telling me I can't ditch that since I have choreographed performances in my family since I was a teen. Not choreographing now will make me look like a jealous and petty person.", "created_utc": 1692688836, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xy5nb/aita_for_expressing_sadness_over_my_cousin/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did she really expect you to just turn up to her wedding? All the family members getting on you about not going , well where were they when Sara didn\u2019t turn up to your wedding? \nWell I hope you stick to your guns because Sara fafo!!", "You\u2019re not unreasonable- your cousin and aunt are absolutely TA. Weddings don\u2019t have to be extravagant or big to be fun. I\u2019m really sorry you were treated like this.", "NTA\n\nI think you should talk to Sara and ask her about it, express your feelings directly to her. As I understand from the post, you haven't discussed the issue with her. I would also be very upset if the person I grew up and had a great relationship with didn't attend my wedding. But the question is did you have a good relationship with her? Because if she didn't attend for no reason she's just not a good person, but if she's holding a grudge against you, it's a different situation. Anyway, this should be discussed only between the two of you. But your reaction is pretty reasonable.", "NTA, you don't owe her bird's shit, never mind any help with wedding preparations. The rest of your family can chill and help, you should spend that time to make yourself happy, heck get a soa weekend for her wedding days or smth and if asked, tell you picked what was more fun for a grown up, married woman or whatever they call you, comparing to you cousin l, lol", "NTA.\n\nYour cousin was either too scared or too ashamed to tell you about the decision they had made regarding which wedding to attend. That's tell ls you basically everything you need to know.\n\nThe truest assholes are your cousin who skipped your wedding and your cousins who couldn't keep their mouth shut when you were doing some very reasonable venting.", "NTA. It\u2019s rude to attend a different wedding just because she thinks it will be more \u201cfun\u201d.  Especially over close family members and some random brother of a friend. I would match her energy and act towards her wedding how she acted towards your wedding. Just say you can\u2019t afford to \u201ctravel\u201d at the moment (even if it\u2019s being held close to where you are) and that you can\u2019t attend because you are \u201ctoo old and married now\u201d.", "As you get older you will get better at recognizing (and keeping an emotional distance from) people who only want a good time, or more specifically people who only want to be with you when you\u2019re entertaining.\n\nTry not to be hurt.  You\u2019ve just learned that your cousin goes into the \u201cgood times only - doesn\u2019t actually give a shit\u201d basket of acquaintances.  Therefore she doesn\u2019t matter . Therefore you don\u2019t have to grieve her loss.\n\nI hope you had a lovely wedding\n\nNTA\n\nEdit to add:  you can add your 31m cousin to the \u201cnot to be trusted\u201d basket and just keep an impersonal polite discourse with him from now on", "NTA - your feelings are perfectly valid. Your cousin has made zero effort here. Your aunt is very much an asshole - she should be asking her daughter why she didn't explain and communicate her intentions upfront, instead of validating her actions with this more fun bs .", "NTA. Just plan something fun the same date as her wedding and do that instead.", "NTA  Tell everyone that by your aunt lying numerous times and cousin ditching you that they don't consider you family. Since you only choreograph for family it won't be happening. You have friends that you plan on spending the day with. After all aunt and cousin showed you that friends are more important than family. You are not being petty, you just believe that you treat others the way you want to be treated. So you are treating them as they treated you.", "NTA, but go easy on the \"practically siblings\" description - you didn't speak to her directly for 18 months when she went away, and all your communication is via your aunt or other relatives. This cousin has made you feel sad - people who are close talk to each other directly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they're using you for free choreography that's even worse. Sara and your aunt FAFO.", "NTA - she didn\u2019t think your wedding was important enough to attend why should you have to attend hers ?  \nWho cares if others call you petty ?  \nOwn it !!  \nSay \u2018Yes I am petty, isn\u2019t that what this family is about ?  After all Sara\u2019s reason for not coming to my wedding and then lying about it were petty ! I thought was how it\u2019s done ?  At least I\u2019m HONEST and petty \u2018", "I tried talking to her last weekend but she said she is out with friends and will give me a call back once she is back (no call yet). I feel she is avoiding me. \n\nAlso I do not remember having done anything that she could be holding a grudge on. Though our mother's do have a sort of passive aggressive relationship where they act cordially but are always having some grudge against each other.", "I called her \"practically siblings\" because we have grown up together in the same house and our families have only started living in seperate houses about 10 years ago. We have always introduced each other as sisters and the word cousin would only come in where it was required to be provided as an added insight.\n\nRegarding not talking once she moved. She always preferred texts over calls and so do I as both of us are busy in studies and work respectively. We talked till the time my aunt told my mom that she won't be attending, her not telling me directly was surprising to me but I figured she was feeling bad about not being able to attend. I tried reaching out a few times including on her birthday but always received \"sis am busy/ in class/ outside with friends will text you back\". I admit after a few of these instances I also stopped as i got busier.", "I get it. You started off close. But 10 years since you lived together, 18 months since you talked, a weddings worth of planning since you've texted, I don't know how long since you've seen each other, or if you've ever been to visit her since she moved... You've grown apart, and neither of you are as invested in the relationship as you once were: that can be sad. I did say NTA."]}
