When my wedding date was finalised my aunt told my mom that Sara won't be attending as she can not afford plane tickets. It was hard for any of us to digest money being the only issue as her family is REALLY rich and she is super pampered but we accepted the reason without any complaints. \n\nMy wedding preparations went on for almost a year and she never even called or texted me. Aunt always said that she is too busy studying but is always asking her about the preparations. Wedding came and I even gave the bridal party gift packet for Sara to Sara's mom as I figured she would have been in my bridal party if she would have been in India. My wedding got over, months passed and I never heard from her except for a congratulations comment on my social media post. \n\nFew months later I find out Sara had travelled to India and attended the wedding of her friend's brother that happened just few days post my wedding. That was a destination wedding and She was staying with her friend's family, helped them with preparations, went on a bachelor's trip with the groom, his sister and friends, and even stayed for few days post the wedding (Indian wedding festivities continue post wedding day). My aunt knew all about this.\n\nHer choosing her friend's brother's (whom she hardly knew prior to wedding) wedding over mine (someone who she has grown up with as practically siblings) hurt me and I told another cousin (31m) about this and also said that I am thinking not to attend Sara's wedding which will happen next year. My cousin promptly tattled to everyone and now am being called selfish for creating a fuss.\n\nI never complained to Sara or my aunt and have always been cordial to them. My aunt even said that Sara chose her friend because it was a destination wedding and hence she obviously had more fun there while my wedding was way too simple for a young person to enjoy. Other relatives are also saying that I am older and married now and hence should act mature and understand why a student would use her vacation time for a fun wedding over mine. Moreover I should stop being petty and not only attend Sara's wedding but also help out as older sister.\n\nAm i really being unreasonable and AITA?\n\nUpdate: Some asked if I had talked to Sara, well I tried by calling her last weekend but she was out with her friends and hence the reception was not great. She said she will call me back but it's been two days with no call. \n\nAlso, forgot to mention I am a trained dancer and have always choreographed performances for all kinds of family functions (dance performances are huge highlights in Indian functions, weddings have a separate dance night with choreographed performances by everyone) hence my aunt and Sara were expecting me to choreograph some dance performances for Sara's wedding. \n\nSo of course if I don't attend that also means I will neither be choreographing nor be helping with any other preparations. Relatives are also telling me I can't ditch that since I have choreographed performances in my family since I was a teen. Not choreographing now will make me look like a jealous and petty person.", "created_utc": 1692688836, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xy5nb/aita_for_expressing_sadness_over_my_cousin/", "score": 561, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But the question is did you have a good relationship with her?

It\u2019s rude to attend a different wedding just because she thinks it will be more \u201cfun\u201d.  Especially over close family members and some random brother of a friend.

What about your husband? If you don't have at least the support of your husband/parents/siblings, it could be hard on you to stick to what you want.\n\n1. If you don't have support, decide what you can live with agreeing to. Maybe you attend but only for bits or just stay in a limited way. Resist being roped into choreographing anything, but if it's too much to resist, do as little as possible. I hate even having to suggest these things, but I know how relentlessly many Indian families can pressure to get what they want, without a thought about your feelings.

It would be a different situation had she called you and spoken to you, instead it sounds like she just wants her way and that's it, regardless of how you feel.\n\nI definitely wouldn't choreograph anything just because you've done it with family, my guess is that you've done it for family members that communicate and appreciate you, not for people that just ignore you and expect you to drop everything for them.\n\nWhen people that are family don't act like it it is very valid to remember this. So about 15+ years ago my sister was getting married. One side of the family is resentful towards my side for something to do with past grievances between our parents and their, well cousins from that side completely slipped out of a family planning meeting for the wedding, basically they said that they weren't family and wouldn't be helping with the wedding. Meanwhile one of that side got married a year later and they expected us to drop everything to help, some of my uncles and my parents did but the vast majority of us just attended and that's it. A few cousins did apologize and recognized that their behavior was shitty after the fact, it really hurt our relations with that side that haven't fully mended.", "NTA just tell them u have other plans that r more \u201cfun\u201d and I will have a better time using ur time on these other plans as u may not enjoy this wedding ur sry u can\u2019t go and also will not be offering ur dancer service for free if they would like to pay u UP FRONT (if not they\u2019ll stiff u or call it a wedding gift) for one dance number u would be more then happy to tape a dance number for them and send it to them so they can learn it otherwise ur booked with something u will enjoy much more the Sara\u2019s weeding, what cokes around goes around", "Tell them that you'll have more fun if you don't choreograph it so they can't fault you for going to have fun and not having to work for free for family members\n\nNTA", "So your aunt and cousin want free services from you? That is the only reason they are upset. I wouldn't go and I sure would not help Sara at all. She sounds spoiled and entitled. NTA.", "Apparently,  family is more important to you than your cousin and aunt. Just tell them you'll be too busy to attend her wedding. No forget explanation is needed. \n\nNTA", "You said it though,  had there been no reciprocity, then yeah, do your thing. Unfortunately the family expects op to slave away for the brat of a cousin so fuck em,  the whole family are assholes. She should send them a bill to be paid upfront before she puts any time in.", "Yeah this is more my concern. Your thoughts are definitely valid, I feel that a lot of your sadness would have been mitigated had she simply picked up the phone and called you. Even now it seems like she's ducking you, just expecting you to be a doormat.", "Don't do any choreography and just ask your aunt to drop off the wedding packet whenever it's convenient for her", "NTA- Her reasoning for skipping was hurtful. If she\u2019d at least said she\u2019d already accepted an invitation to another wedding I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have been disappointed but more understanding than with her fully lying and ignoring your wedding. The fact that she couldn\u2019t be bothered to congratulate you and send a token card/gift is also a disappointing way for someone you feel close with to act. It sounds like you are closer to her than she is to you. \n\nI would say, her wedding date sounds like a great time for you and your husband to go do a fun vacation at a great destination. After all, you\u2019re now a mature married woman, who knows how many more opportunities you and your husband will have to travel like that before starting your family. It could be your last chance to travel as child-free adults. \ud83d\ude09\n\nEditing to add- Any family who try to shame you for not attending or choreographing for her wedding, please tell them, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to disappoint the family. However, cousin should know, you get from a relationship exactly what you put in. She put nothing in and that is exactly what she\u2019s getting in return.\u201d", "NTA 100%\n\nShe chose to not only NOT support you through your wedding activities, she didn't even attend! It's true: everyone has a choice in things like this but there are also consequences. I'm getting big golden child vibes the way your family is being defensive about Sara's actions\n\nAnd now that her lack of interest or empathy has the consequence of you not supporting her for her wedding, everyone's telling YOU to not be petty? Petty is lying about why someone's not attending a wedding, to only leave a comment on a SM post as their biggest gesture. Even if you have no one on your side, stick up for yourself. Ask them why you have to put your feelings aside for their advantage? Because you're older? Because your wedding wasn't \"fun\"? Those are things out of your control. She chose to be absent in every way possible. We show people how we want to be treated: she treated you like an after thought, now return the favor. That's not being petty, that's having self respect", "NTA.  First keep saying you\u2019ll choreograph a dance,  but be vague about when and keep pushing it out.  Next Plan an elaborate vacation for the week of the week of her wedding and don\u2019t tell anyone.  Third definitely don\u2019t go to that narcissists wedding and post all your photos Constantly. But that\u2019s just me I\u2019m a lil petty.", "You should also say you are \u201ctoo odd\u201d now to do any choreography if people keep asking.", "Good point!! She could\u2019ve attended both but missed OPs entire wedding for pre wedding stuff for some random person! Like not even the friend but her friends brother!", "This whole thread really needs to be on an India-specific subreddit. I have only the vaguest idea what the etiquette involved is and so do most other people posting. \n\nWhether or not you're an asshole in certain situations varies according to the cultural expectations. \n\nSara sounds like she doesn't care about OP much since she didn't bother keeping in touch with her, but making an excuse instead of saying \"your wedding is less fun\" is polite, and you're allowed to invite people to your wedding even if you couldn't make it to theirs for whatever reason. Would it be an AH move for OP to not attend her wedding in retaliation? I have no idea.", "There\u2019s a book called The Blue Castle that you might see yourself in.", "NTA - plan a getaway during her wedding and tell your family it just seemed more fun", "NTA because I'm an Indian American and understand the etiquette/cultural implications here.\n\nIf this cousin you grew up with could have easily attended your wedding but chose not to, she's committed a \"cultural faux pas\" that may not resonate as strongly in other cultures. Indian weddings are strongly characterized by the ceremonial joining of two families (unlike Western weddings which focus on the joining of two individuals). If your cousin has embraced the rugged individualism of Western culture, that's her decision, but it's hypocritical to then demand the benefits of family-oriented Indian values (help with preparations, Sangeet choreography, etc)\n\nI was born in India but grew up in America, so I've been the bored kid at the cousin's wedding whose unintelligible Hindi was the butt of many jokes. As I've gotten older, I've grown ever more thankful that my parents didn't allow me to skip the grueling 24-hour journeys to India, because I would have unknowingly lost the \"closeness\" with my extended family otherwise.", "NTA\n\nIf you insist on choregraphing then do a really crap job..... you'll put in as much effort as your cousin did for you... and it would still be more than she did.", "She\u2019s older and married and responsible now, she has more important stuff to do \ud83d\udc4d", "OP says her aunt and Sara were expecting her help, but the only one of these two she's spoken with is the Aunt. Again, I don't think OP actually knows if Sara expects this of her for real or if the Aunt is just SAYING that because she (the aunt) expects it."]}
