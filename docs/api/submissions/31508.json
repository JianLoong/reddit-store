I have never gotten along with my sister, she's a pick me and irresponsible, narcissistic and selfish. Which I don't blame her for, i blame my parents who absolutely adore her in every way, but her personality and attitude towards me has always driven me away.\n\nShe and her husband 'John' (30M) along with their kids (9F & 6m) all live with my parents. John works in construction and amy is a SAHM. My parents pay for their food, bills, the kids expenses as well and generally have to pitch in for other stuff. My parents are obviously fine with this because it's their darling daughter amy\n\nAmy and John are irresponsible. Amy  throws a tantrum whenever my dad suggests that she could also get a job. John is outright abusive towards my niece and nephew, with frequent namecalling and yelling and threats. \nMy parents don't say anything to them because \"it's their kids\" and \"they'll learn\". Well Amy got pregnant a few months ago and announced on Halloween that she's pregnant.\nEveryone was happy for her and congratulated her including me, but I was secretly dying inside thinking about how they were going to fuck this kid up as well. \n\nWell our brother came to town 2 weeks ago, we were at my parents house for dinner and I told him about how Amy's pregnant again and John and her are going to mess this child up like they did with the previous ones...and he laughed. Well apparently my mom heard us and decided to lecture us on kindness and to not say such stuff with a kid on the way. I replied that If I followed that rule then i would never get to say anything because there's always a child on the way. I guess i didn't realise amy came in and heard me and lashed out. She threw some stuff at me called me a bitch and some other deranged stuff and didn't eat dinner and sat in her room all evening till me and my brother left. My dad asked me why I said that and how it was rude and inappropriate. I simply said that she and John aren't responsible and they can barely handle themselves without my mom's and dad's help, but I guess good for her because she won't raise this kid you guys will. \n\nMy mom and amy aren't talking to me and even told me not to come to the baby shower. \nMy dad said that I should apologise and patch things up before it's too late. I said that i didn't say anything that warranted an apology and that if amy feels upset then there must be some truth to my words. \n\nMy husband says that while I am right about amy and johns behaviour, I shouldn't have said that especially behind her back. My brother says that i shouldn't apologize because amy will get over it in a month anyway. I do think that maybe I shouldn't have talked behind her back but that she needed to know the truth and I'm not going to apologise anytime soon..\n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1700668428, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181cbva/aita_for_saying_my_sister_shouldnt_have_another/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Could you have picked a better place/time to have this convo? Sure. But it\u2019s true. Maybe Amy and John need a little tough love and to be forced to take care of their own needs. Your mom and dad feed off of them at the same time. It\u2019s a deranged symbiotic relationship but it is what it is. Amy and John don\u2019t want to grow up and your parents want to keep being parents. They want this to continue. It sounds like all 4 of them need therapy.", "Sheesh.\n\nNTA first of all.\nI find it so annoying when people have children. They cannot afford and cannot take care of and then happily announce the third.\n\nI could not agree with you more. Honestly you did her a favor because she has to hear it from someone.\n\nAnd if I were you I would take a big step back from this situation.\nJust live your life be independent and be happy", "NTAm your parent are enabling this shitshow, they are watching their grandchildren being abused and they don\u2019t step forward? \n\nSERIOUSLY? Throw the whole family out, none of them are worth it. Those poor kids \ud83e\udee0", "Your parents raised a spoiled brat and reaping what they sowed. There's obvious truth to what you said and your mom and sister both know it. Also, apologies are meaningless if you don't really mean them.

You and your brother would not be out of line to have a sit down with your parents and discuss the situation. Darling Amy is a spoiled brat that never grew up and her husband sounds like a boorish arse. I\u2019d be concerned how this dynamic will play out as your parents age.", "NTA - I don't congratulate anyone for getting creampied so you're already way nicer than you have to be.", "NTA but I agree with your husband. Not worth talking about it behind her back, but I agree with your assessment of the situation.", "You're entitled to feel however you like about your sister and her situation. However, going to your parent's house (which is also Amy's home), and talking shit about what a terrible parent she and her husband are is AH behavior. You were guests there, why do you think it's okay to make rude remarks and mock them? \n\nYou sound like one of those people who likes to say they're just an honest person. In this case, it doesn't matter if what you said was true, you're an AH for being catty and rude and doubling down on it after the fact.

YTA. \n\nIf your sister is happy with having another kid and your parents are fine wirh supporting her and her family, then their arrangment none of your business. Of course you can have an oppinion about how shitty your sister is as a parent, but if she heard you say such things you cannot expect her to be OK with it. Same goes for your mom. Now, don't apologize if you don't want to, but then do not expect your family to act as if nothing happened. You were rude and said some hurful things, and now your sister feels hurt. Well, what did you expect to happen?", "YTA. Telling someone who's already pregnant and 100% keeping it that they shouldn't have another child will always be an AH move. This isn't just about your concern for kids. You hate your sister, and you hate that your parents enable her, and I can't blame you for that", "Yta. You hurt your sister\u2019s feelings and you don\u2019t care, this is pretty cut and dry. Even if you\u2019re right, there really isn\u2019t an excuse to tear someone down especially when the situation doesn\u2019t involve you. If you suspect abuse, there was definitely better ways to voice your concerns then the way that you chose.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Oh no what if your asshole sister never speaks to you again? *Tragic*", "NTA. You're right. Amy is the golden child and you are either the scapegoat or the lost child and so is your brother. \n\nYour brother should keep his children away from John. \n\nAmy and John both are leeching off your parents. If it winds up being that you cut them off or they cut you off...breathe a sigh of relief and wait for the inevitable to happen. \n\nEither your parents will get sick of supporting their entire family and boot them out or your parents will pass away and they will come running to you for help. \n\nBe ready to tell them no.

No, you don't owe them an apology.  However you do owe CPS a call it sounds like for the kid's sake.", "ESH  the baby is already on the way. Many of us have these feelings but are careful who to bounce then too. You aren't wrong, but you should have kept it to yourself or your best friend.
