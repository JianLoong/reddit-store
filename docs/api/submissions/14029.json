And she is absolutely the way she is because of our parents. They would threaten to get teachers fired for giving Kayley a bad grade. Kayley\u2019s behavior would get swept under the rug because the school didn\u2019t want to deal with my parents. Kayley was given no boundaries at home either. I limit my communication with my parents and Kayley, as their enablement of her has only gotten worse.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 Joseph (25M) and I are getting married in August. While dating, I learned that Joseph was one of the people Kayley severely bullied during high school and cyber-bullied when he was in college. Joseph and I have tried both individually and together to confront Kayley about her bullying. Kayley has never apologized for her bullying and frequently denies it ever happened. Her response is always something along the lines of \u201cWell, even if I **did** do that, he should get over it\u201d or \u201cThat was all the way back during the pandemic, he should have learned to take a joke by now.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, a friend of Kayley\u2019s passed away unexpectedly. Kayley and her friend used to hang out with each other every day, but from what I know, they hadn\u2019t really been in touch since high school. Now Kayley and my parents are insisting that she\u2019s had a change of heart because her friend\u2019s death made Kayley realize that you never know how much time you have left with people and she wants to be more involved in my life. However, despite these claims, Kayley still refuses to apologize for any of her bullying toward me or Joseph.\n\nPreviously, Kayley had no interest in attending my wedding. But now says that she wants to attend and expects a \u201cplace of honor\u201d such as a bridesmaid. I told Kayley that she is not welcome at my and Joseph\u2019s wedding. Her refusal to apologize or admit wrongdoing shows us that she isn\u2019t sincere about wanting to be a better sister and overall person towards us. This is supposed to be one of the biggest and happiest days of my and Joseph\u2019s lives, and we aren\u2019t saving any seats for a bully.\n\nMy parents are pushing Kayley\u2019s change of heart claims and are saying I should have more sympathy for my sister because of her friend\u2019s death. Several family members are supporting my parents and say they will not attend my wedding unless Kayley is invited. My paternal grandparents have always been there for me and Joseph and want to attend, but they cannot because they would need my aunt or her husband to take them. My grandparents rely very heavily on my aunt due to their poorer health and they\u2019re scared to go against her and potentially lose her support.\n\nAll of our friends agree that we should not have to invite Kayley to the wedding. But I should invite her for my grandparents\u2019 sake because they know how much my grandparents want to come, and inviting Kayley would be the unfortunate but necessary means to make sure they can be there. Are we the AHs for still holding back an invitation for Kayley?", "created_utc": 1680652113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12c18k9/aita_for_being_upfront_with_my_sister_that_she/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn\u2019t want my bully to be at my wedding.", "My grandparents would be able to get a ride there easily. The issue is that they rely a lot on my aunt due to their poorer health. They're afraid that if they go against her, they will lose her much-needed support.", "This.\n\nOr hire a caregiver/driver for them for the day.", ">Her response is always something along the lines of \u201cWell, even if I did do that, he should get over it\u201d or \u201cThat was all the way back during the pandemic, he should have learned to take a joke by now.\u201d\n\nOP Does this sound like Kayley?\n\n**The Narcissist's Prayer**  \nThat didn't happen.  \nAnd if it did, it wasn't that bad.  \nAnd if it was, that's not a big deal.  \nAnd if it is, that's not my fault.  \nAnd if it was, I didn't mean it.  \nAnd if I did, you deserved it.", "NTA. And OP's parents are still enabling her. \n\nIf I was Joe, I wouldn't marry into that family because it will never get better.", "Parents are still enabling Kayley, trying to get her way with OP\u2019s wedding and getting the whole family in on it. I\u2019d uninvited anyone who supports Kayley and continue with life.", "This. If peripheral family refuse to attend because they wanna pressure you to invite Kayley, then YAY your guest list just got shorter -- good riddance!\n\nFor your grandparents (unless they LIVE with your hideous aunt) you and Joseph could arrange a visit to their home a couple days after the wedding, show them photos on your iPad, and even wear your wedding outfits for them. And bring some cake! \n\nNTA for putting your foot down", ">Maybe get an Uber for your grandparents?\n\nSadly, my grandparents getting a ride isn't the obstacle. They're afraid that if they go against my aunt, they will lose her support. They really very heavily on her due to their poorer health.\n\n>possibly a cluster b malignant personality disorder such as anti social personality disorder\n\nI doubt that Kayley has any kind of serious mental disorder. It's more that our parents have enabled her for so long that she's never learned to grow up. In many ways, she is still emotionally stuck as a child.", "eh, she'll get over it, it's been 3 hours already.", "So what you\u2019re saying is bullying runs in the family?", "wow so your aunt is shitty enough to withhold support from her aging parents simply for attending their grandchild's wedding when she doesn't want them to? if she wants to boycott your wedding herself that's one thing but how cruel can she be to punish her parents for choosing not to? I'm so sorry", "That's terrible, but if you live your life based on what your aunt wants so as not to lose contact with your grandparents, your life will be miserable. You can't set that precedent by letting your aunt call the shots for the wedding. Giving into a blackmailer just means the demands will never stop.\n\nNTA and hold your ground. Our pap and 2 of the groom's grandparents were unable to attend my sister's wedding due to health. The bride and groom visited them afterwards to celebrate.", "Disinvite them all and go NC. NTA.", "Not gonna lie that sounds like elder abuse.", "You might want to have security on hand at the venue because your sister is coming. Best wishes to you and your future husband.", "Most personality disorders are trained and you are not born with them. Parenting is a huge part of your personality.\n\nOn another note: If your grandparents are too afraid to attend, you could make a video of the ceremony and closely after the wedding you, your husband and them can watch it and have a nice private dinner. Maybe with some snacks and so on.\n\nI mean it isn't the same as being there but it could still be a fond memory down the line."]}
