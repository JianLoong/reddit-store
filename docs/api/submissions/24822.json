But i would never force him to eat anything. I might offer him more time on his tablet to eat different foods.", "NTA. I'm an autistic ADHD adult who wasn't diagnosed until a few years ago. I had extremely weird food quirks. It was a texture thing and I don't like my food to touch. Pretty sure I lived of apples and peanut butter for a good 3 years. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Also, I was never a fan of mashed potatoes or Mac n cheese. Don't like anything with weird fatty chewy pieces, slimy stuff, or anything pasty.", "Good grief! Kids can be fussy eaters. My 7 year old granddaughter eats meat. That's it. No fruit, no veggies. On the other hand,her brother,5,would eat shit with sugar on it if it was on his plate and came with sauce of any description. Just give him what he likes,he'll grow out of it.NTA.", "Sweet encourage more food aversion. I think your Aunt had lots of soft parenting.", "NTA\n\nAs a mother of an autistic kid, the food struggle can be REAL sometimes. I have gotten some really good tips from @kids.eat.in.color She\u2019s a mom and a nutritionist and doesn\u2019t do the shame game. I also stopped listening to boomers and their outdated advice that borders on abuse. Good luck, and it WILL get better. Three is just a tough age in general; fun, but tough.", "I used to think people believing you could get Autism because of vaccins were the dumb dumbs, but this auntie showed me whole new of dumb", "As soon as I read this I knew the asshole was the aunt. Not forcing your kids to sit at the table until they eat food they hate isn\u2019t why autism diagnoses have gone up.", "This.  NTA.  Your aunt sounds like a nut case.  She really thinks that the reason kids get diagnosed with autism is because of soft parenting?  I almost choked when I read that.  You're doing fine dad.", "Nta for real.  Kiddo kept his pants on and didn't bite anyone, that's a win.", "My son has food sensory issues. There are so many foods he won't eat and we have to work around. You know what happened the one time I tried to get him to eat a new food he said he didn't like (before we found out about the sensory issues)? He puked on me. My fault 100%. So, now I find safe foods for him to eat and suggest he try new things to see if he likes them. If he says no, cool. Thanks for trying. He will not starve because he doesn't like any potato other than instant. Kids are still people and he doesn't deserve for me to be upset because he doesn't follow an arbitrary food rule.", "My mom cooked about 178974336795422 million chicken breasts with rice and a veggie for me growing up. While cooking for the rest of the family all kinds of fun meals, with lots of variety, so they never got tired of eating the same thing. They tried all the new things. The only time I ate the same thing as everyone else was when they had my normal meal or she made spaghetti or lasagna. That's it, 3 meals. I also wouldn't eat a sandwich if it was put together (I'd eat all the parts separately as long as they never ever even thought about touching). \n\nNever once did she complain. She'd offer me what they had, once in a while she would ask me to try something that was new to me but never forced it. \n\nI'm so incredibly grateful for her approach now as an adult and no longer picky and have a very healthy relationship with food. I actually love trying new things or eating all the stuff I wouldn't have touched with a 10-foot pole as a kid. \n\nI take the same approach with my kids, and so does she when they go there. On top of that, she always asks if it's ok to give them something if she thinks it might be new before even trying. There are a few things all my kids always eat that she always keeps on hand in case there's an emergency and I need to quickly drop them off with no notice so she'll always have something they will happily eat. My oldest has always been picky but is getting better with age, at least with being willing to try new things. I'm so thankful I never have to worry if he'll eat when he's with her and not me. \n\nWe've had our fair share of differences over the years, but that's one thing that she always felt so strongly about. Her favorite thing in the world to do is feed people, and you'll never go to her house without her knowing she has something that you like to eat there. \n\n\nOp you're so far from the ah you can't even see the line anymore. NTA. You're setting a foundation of more than just what your son eats right now. You're showing him you'll listen to his needs and wants and you'll protect him from the things that to him are bad or dangerous (because to a 3 year old, food they don't like is dangerous). You're teaching him it's ok to speak up about what he does not like and teaching him to have a healthy view on foods. You're following doctors' orders on top of that. Great job!!", "I used to leave the Pizza Hut - I KNOW!! - to go across the street and buy myself a hot dog!! I have no idea what I was thinking!!", "My husband was super picky well into his 20s and his mom never pushed it, just made him his own version (probably because she also has foods she\u2019s very against eating). \n\nSlowly as an adult he expanded his palate and now eats almost everything he didn\u2019t when he was young. Coconut was just added to his diet this year\u2026 \n\nHe\u2019s by far the most adventurous eater I know. He\u2019s willing to try almost anything and for fun likes to go on \u201cfood adventures\u201d to try new food.", "I have a thing against crust. As in I hate it almost as much as I hate even the essence of celery. I will not eat it on pizza, sandwiches \u2014 which means I hate buns of all kinds.

He never did that shit again \ud83d\ude02", "I had boyfriend who only ate pizza & cottage cheese\n And drank only water & orange soda. Occasionally a beer.

It was so frustrating, and I was so happy when he asked for a hamburger. LOL", "Something!", "My children ate everything until they hit two and then it all stopped. Went to many doctors and dietitians as what 2 year old would happily starve than eat most foods. Turns out they are both on the spectrum and it was down to texture and taste. For a long time they couldn\u2019t have food touching and most frustarting they like different than each other. One won\u2019t go near any form of potatoes, chips/fries at all because of the texture of them, the other will only eat one type of meat and only prepared and cooked one way due to once again the texture. Even working with dieticians to try and get them to try little bits of  things regularly hoping to expand their taste buds and get them used to different tastes as advised. Basically even the specialists told me they are healthy and that\u2019s all that matter. Although it could get frustrating as when not feeling good they couldn\u2019t even eat their normal food as it wouldn\u2019t look right to them or taste right. \n\nWhen it comes down to it would not be good to turn meals into wars and possibly give them eating disorders or for them to come to dread meal times. Pick you battles appropriately and don\u2019t Waste time or energy on those you won\u2019t change and those there is no real reason to change anyway.", "In before ban, but there are actual studies that kind of show a link. And the person that squished those studies and ordered everything buried \"nothing to see here\", well she went on to work for said pharmaceutical company a few years later making a really large salary.....

If she wants to raise a kid, tell her there are plenty of kids that need adopted!", "My poor parents always had to get me something else when they wanted pizza lol.

I finally sat her down (age 6 or so) and we drafted a list of all foods she would eat anytime they were served...she signed it like a contract!\n\nWhen I served something she didn't like, I always gave her the option of making something herself - she could make a small variety of sandwiches and snacks by that age and that launched her into cooking for herself. She was cooking full meals by the time she was 12 and as an adult? She makes cauliflower soup and has her own sour dough starter for homemade bread.\n\nShe got over it. :)", "Vaccines don't cause autism but I'd be pro-vax even if they did.
