I would say I only reached this state a few months ago though. My partner works as a bartender with a very erratic schedule. Some weeks he works 4 days and some he works none. So I make a lot more money than him. \n\nHowever, I didn't come from a well off family. I grew up in a trailer park and was abused by several family members. I got out and made it my mission to save everything penny so I could go to college. When I did, I chose the cheapest college and the cheapest program even though it wasn't what I wanted to do. I knew it would get me a good job. I worked multiple jobs, did an accelerated program, and I ended up having several disk herniations and spinal surgery while trying to finish my degree. When I finally did, I found out my partner of almost threw years was cheating on me. I left him, and he flipped out. Unfortunately the car we had paid for together was in his name, so he took that and he raided the house and took everything. At the time I was working a good job I had gotten with my degree, but I was only making about 45k so it took several months of scraping and saving while in spinal surgery recovery to buy a car to get me to work. Just a few months ago I've finally gotten to a place where I have a savings cushion and I've risen in the ranks in my job and am now making about 70k.\n\nNow yesterday we were actually watching Amish reddit stories about people who try to split the bill after people have already eaten. I kinda went on a tirade about how entitled that is and how I find it to be really rude. He seemed offended by this and said \"if you make significantly more than someone like a friend, you should pay for them at like dinners and stuff\". I countered saying \"for me, I have worked extremely hard to be in a better place so I shouldnt be responsible for others who haven't, like I was there too at one point\". He then said \"but you are in a better place now\". I didn't see why that should matter and I told him \"that was a really entitled mindset and it makes me feel used as while others were just living life, I put everything like friends, trips, buying myself things, eating out, on hold so I could invest in my future and I shouldnt be expected to give money to people who haven't done that\". He said \"w.e.\" and we didn't talk about it again. \n\nJust for context in the relationship as well, I do pay for most dates and meals, partly because I know he makes way less than me and for a partner I'm willing to do that, but I do also feel a bit of pressure to as well. \n\nNow I'm feeling some type of way cause if I am actually the AH I kinda want to know, so I thought I would ask the Internet and see what the verdict is.\n\nTLDR: my boyfriend thinks I should pay for people who have less money than I do.\n\nUPDATE\nI just wanted to add an update here after reading everyone's comments. I really appreciate how many people have taken the time to respond. \nI did just want to say that I don't believe people who have less are lazy. I have a lot of friends who make less through no fault of there own. They work multiple jobs or fill time hours though, or they have some kind of situation that prevents them from it. When I made the comment about it being my hard work I was mostly thinking about my boyfriend who works not even close to full time and is perfectly able, but makes no plans for the future. \nMy sister is moving in with me next month and I plan to pay for most of her stuff until she can get on her feet because I sympathize and most importantly I can see she's trying. It's just people who are very clearly being lazy and expect me to pay because I'm not. \nIt makes me feel unseen specific by my boyfriend because I worked so hard and now he just acts like he deserves my money. \nIt really bothered me one time when I went a month and a half without a day off in March and I really felt like I was busting my ass just to subsidise his date meals when he could just work an extra shift. \nBut thank you again for all the support, I appreciate all the time it took people to read this and respond.", "created_utc": 1693197288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163c92x/aita_f22_for_not_paying_for_people_who_make_less/", "score": 1794, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why are you meeting people in places where they can't afford to eat? If you want to see people without a lot of money, agree to meet for coffee or invite them to a BBQ at your place.", "Congratulations. \nYou are doing well for yourself at such a young age.\nYou aren't really in a position with your finances to act as a money bag for others. \nSave, invest, buy a home when feasible, progress in your career and build your wealth.  Treat yourself every once in a while to a nice dinner, vacation etc.\nAfter that you can show your largesse to others.", "Im going to go ESH.\n\nI do however agree that asking for it to be split after the fact is wrong. \n\nWhere the ESH here is your reasoning and justification. You base worth on wealth. Some people work hard and do their best and don\u2019t get the break. Others hit issues which cause financial hardship through no fault of their own. Others may choose to pursue careers which are not lucrative but for them entirely enjoyable and fulfilling. \n\nThis statement\n\n \u201cI have worked extremely hard to be in a better place so I shouldnt be responsible for others who haven't\u201d  \n\nShows a lack of maturity and understanding.\n\n\nSo in essence you are both wrong. A friendship shouldn\u2019t be transactional nor should you spring surprises about cash \u2018ie bill splitting\u2019 at the end of a meal, but also an argument that you are better than them is just as bad a mindset to have.\n\nEdit: just seen you are 22 as well, I wouldn\u2019t gloat yet. I know a lot of people that didn\u2019t know what they wanted to do early in life and stumbled around for a while. They are now significantly wealthier than some of the early career people.", "YTA \n\nfor what it's worth, i don't think it's mandatory to pay for things like dinner bills just because you make a certain amount. it is extremely kind to, but not mandatory. \n\nmy judgment comes from the fact that your justification for why you won't is simply \"people who haven't overcome poverty just don't work hard enough [like i have].\" that's an awful attitude to have about life, class, and the poor in general, especially when you were once there yourself. \n\nyou aren't better than anyone because of your middle class salary.", "ESH BF is out of line, but you are a hypocrite.

If he is not then ask yourself if you want someone who is always wanting you to pick up the slack.\n\nI understand that for a partner you do things for each other but make sure he isn\u2019t getting to comfortable with that. Some people will be okay with going out more if they know they don\u2019t have to pay.", "NTA. Honestly hate splitting the bill at the end of a group dinner, specially when you know some people have bought the expensive stuff and other have bought cheap stuff.\n\nBut we'll done on getting to where you are at such a young age.", "NTA - don't let anyone take advantage of you.  You shouldn't have to pay for everything, especially because other people make less money.  Start splitting things 60/40 or 70/30 if he can't afford 50/50.  You shouldn't have to fund his lifestyle.", "NTA. Your hard-earned money, you spend or save however pleases you. Any other people;s opinion about your money is insignificant.", "NTA - I have to say I find your post awesome. I've never understood the concept of simply splitting a bill evenly. And I am coming from the opposite of you. I mostly make all my food at home because I don't make that much money. But if more well-off friends want to go out and want me there, I will make an effort to go. I will just order what I can afford and should only have to pay for that. In my opinion it is so much worse for people in your financially stable position to expect someone with less to split a bill evenly. As long as you aren't judging anybody for their financial situation I see no reason for you being an AH at all.", "NTA. As one of the poorer people in my friend group, it is not someone else's responsibility to pay for my meals. We all either pay for our own meals or take turns paying, but it is agreed before. It's rude to expect someone to pay for your meal because they earn more than you.", "As someone making 4-5 average salaries a month, I have the following approach - when I go out with close friends I know are in a worse financial situation, I have the tendency to take charge if the paybill. Note I am aware they are truly struggling, with the husband working 12 hours shifts. When I go out with people in a far better financial situation than myself, I have no problem of them taking charge of the paybill and even when my wife is making a fuss about it, we joke about it like - don't worry he's in a way better place than me, having no wife and no kids. Note my friend group has no slackers and we all take jokes well. There is no room for slackers / lazy folks when we talk about taking charge of paybills.", "I think the closest you get to splitting the bill is paying for you're food. I watched a video where some guy was young and didn't have much money but went out with his friends. He ordered a $10 mac and cheese while everyone else ordered 30 dollar things. Well at the end when the bill came it was a couple $100 and he would've had to pay like 150. He put down a $10 dollar note and never talked to them again. Little bit of a long story but that's why I feel like people should pay for how much their food is not everyone else's", "NTA. It even more than how hard you\u2019ve worked to achieve what you have. There are people who complain about not having enough money but eat out every night, but expensive cars, buy designer clothes, get hair extensions, go on trips etc then expect you to pay for them after you gave up that stuff to save money.", "By his logic, it's perfectly ok and should even be encouraged to let others use you. NTA", "NTA - I was once in that kind of relationship where mister was jealous I was making more (guilt tripping me if I dared buy something a bit fancy for me) but still was expecting he could enjoy the extra money. I dumped him, and met my now husband a year later.", "Definitely NTA. People should pay their own way regardless of how much money they make. You don't sit around the table with friends and say ok who earns more to decide who picks up the bill. In saying that, when I've had friends who were struggling I've shouted them a night out. I've had friends do the same for me. This happened a lot in my 20's but now that I'm in my 40's it doesn't really happen.  I also often shout a friend who regularly travels to have lunch with me, it's my way of saying thank you.", "NTA. He wants to look like a big shot spending your money", "What\u2019s he realistically going to say, OP? \n\nHe benefits from you paying for meals and dates etc. He likes eating, and he likes going out, and he works sporadically. So, of course his position is going to be that ppl who make less should be treated by those with more money. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA here about paying for others, but I\u2019d be careful with this boyfriend. He should be included in the group \u201cpeople who make less money than me.\u201d Don\u2019t have a separate rule for friends and boyfriends on this. \n\nIf it\u2019s a good way to get taken advantage of in a friendship, it\u2019s a GREAT way to get taken advantage of in a relationship.", "NTA There\u2019s never been a shortage of people trying to freeload under every pretense you can imagine.  You\u2019re not obligated to pay for anyone. You can be as generous as you like, or not at all.", "NTA\n\n\u2018Should\u2019 is way too strong a word. You are not responsible for subsidizing your friends and acquaintances who make less than you.  Do not get guilted into doing so\n\nOne of the things that is nice to do with money is to be generous and treat others to things. This should happen entirely at your discretion and within your means of doing so responsibly and to those that you want to. \n\nIf you *never* pay for anyone who makes less than you because you pulled yourself up by your bootstraps, I\u2019d think that was the wrong approach. But if you\u2019re expected to foot the bill every time you\u2019re out with your friends because he have a decent paying job, then i disagree with that too", "NTA nobody is your financial responsibility.", "Nobody is entitled to your income or assets. The ones who try to lay claim are lazy.", "NTA\n\nhere\u2019s a fun story. I earnt double my partners wage. It wasn\u2019t always like that. He had a well paying job but chose a menial job for his mental health. But all money was pooled and we spent and saved together and did renovations etc. His car blew up and he needed a new one. We decided we\u2019d go down to one vehicle, trade mine in and get a loan. I did the math and saw that an extra loan was going to have us substantially out of pocket. So my solution to him was we need to cut back on spending or he needed to go back to the high paying job \u201cone or two days a week\u201d. He cracked it. He broke up. He did not want to cut back on spending and curb the lifestyle he\u2019s become accustomed to\u2026.. which I was funding but didn\u2019t want to contribute more either. We broke up. And I will never \u201cshare\u201d my money ever again in a relationship", "NTA. If you don't live together. Dump him and block him. He's going to start using you more and more.", "The answer is it depends.\n\nIt depends on their relationship with you, how much of an income difference there is, and how expensive the activity is.", "NTA: Dump him and run! You're not too invested yet, and need someone with your mindset.", "My husband I have been literally on the bare bones of our asses.  If we get invited to a meal when broke we either plead another engagement, or illness.  There is no way our better off friends are paying for us.  If we can't afford it we don't do it.", "NTA. With your upbringing, you should take a hard look at your love interests because you probably tent to take on guys who (will) take advantage of you. If you\u2019ve been abused, it\u2019s unfortunately likely to hook up with an abuser as a partner. \n\nThis present partner works 20 hours, and has zero problems with you paying for everything while you work way too much. Is he contributing in other ways? I bet he isn\u2019t. Does he do your laundry, dishes, provides you with emotional support, gets out of bed to drive you to work?

I was going to say something about the lazy people part, but after the edit I get your point. I got the feeling you were frustrated and didn\u2019t use the right word at the time", "NTA, lmao in what world would you have to pay for someone who chooses not to work hard. i mean i personally would consider my stance on the relationship because like you said it seems like he doesn\u2019t really care what he does but you do. in the long run where on person chooses to work weird hours and the other works their ass off never goes wrll", "Yup. Time to move on.", "I have to agree. Having friends who aren't doing financially well (and knowing financial hardship myself) I'm not going to let my friends starve. But at the same time I expect them to be honest about their financial capabilities. If you can't afford the restaurant we decided on, say that. If I have the means I will likely offer to pay for you as a courtesy anyway. Or we can make a new plan. But I am not obligated to pay for my friends just because I can afford to. I do it because they're my friend and I *want* to.", "my friends would be embarrassed if i had to pick up a bill for them. however we do pick up alternate bills.", "Maybe he was feeling uncomfortable and guilty about you paying more for him, so he overreacted?\nNTA. Unless you offer to pay for others it should not be expected.", "^^^ this\n\nAnd I'd be concerned about the BF's perspective, meaning that since he makes less than you, you are expected to pay for him. It may be dates for now, and may evolve into vacations, housing, car repairs, or basically everything. If you don't reign it in now, the BF may feel quite entitled to be supported by you and your much higher wages.", "Also, there are people I know who would be totally offended if you always picked up the bill with the unspoken reason being \"I make more money than you.\" Just bc someone makes less money doesn't mean they need you to pay.", "they are definitely an asshole for implying people who don't make as much money as them do not work as hard.", "There is a limit to this rule in my opinion. Because we're not in the iron nor the golden age now and we've seen a lot of abuse in this world. For exemple, if one haven't work a bit for a sh*tload of gold, if this particular just keep it for himself while other arround starved, this is really wrong, isn't it? After that, you may do what you want with your more than necessary gold but YWBTA :)", "Best comment on here...abusees unconsciously try to buy affection...you are better off alone than with any kind of abuser; mental emotional physical or FINANCIAL or all of the above in one lazy azz \ud83d\udce6 .... \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Op is young.

It's a personal failing.", "Or as B.B. King would say, \"You're paying the cost to be the boss.\"", "Growing up poor and abused didn't make me a calloused asshole who looks down on others with an \"I got mine\" attitude. OP lives a lie of rugged individualism ignoring all the people who helped her along the way even when her family didn't. No one is an island.", "Sure. Idea AND invitation.   \nThe important thing is to make it clear and obvious beforehand, to avoid the misunderstandings and awkward situations.", "But it did make you bitter with a complete lack of understanding. OP helped herself along the way, she should be proud of that. A \u201cworked hard for what I have\u201d is not an \u201cI got mine\u201d attitude. And \u201cliving a lie of rugged individualism\u201d\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI think you\u2019re trying to use big terms without understanding what you\u2019re saying. OP, there is absolutely nothing wrong with not allowing someone to bully you into paying for something that you never agreed to pay for. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re ignoring people along the way! Don\u2019t let people with ridiculous ideas about how life should be make you think you\u2019ve done wrong!", "They \"went on a tirade\" about paying for those with less money and have indicated throughout this post they think that people with less don't work as hard. OP needs therapy.", "I would go on a tirade too if someone told me I should foot the bill because I make more money. I would also go on a tirade about my lazy bf if I was in her position. Standing up for yourself and protecting what is yours does not put you in need of therapy\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "The tirade was entirely unprompted. No one said they have to do anything before that. After going on a tirade, the bf makes a counter point and OP blames people being less well off on having not worked hard. Normal, well adjusted people don't go on tirades and then get upset when the person subjected to it politely brings up a counterpoint. Get therapy OP. You may have financial anxiety and definitely have a poor conception of how the world works.", "Her reaction was prompted by something she saw, then fueled by a lazy bf who said she should pay because she makes more money. That\u2019s not a polite counterpoint. Not wanting to pay for others because she makes more money does not equate with a skewered view of how the world works. It sounds like OP hit a nerve with you. I hope you\u2019re getting needed help, I\u2019m saying that sincerely, not as a snide comment. If OP needs therapy for anything it should be for why she stays with a bf who is using her to not have to work as hard as he should be.", "I'd personally be questioning where exactly things are going with him. He's 22 with no clear ambition and seemingly no desire to better himself and his situation. Meanwhile wasting precious time, whole weeks of dissing about doing nothing productive...plodding along slowly on a zero hours contract, with no financial stability, career progression etc. \n\nIt's still early on in your relationship, so a lot of warning signs tend to get dismissed. However, once the honeymoon phase eventually fizzles out and reality hits, you'll be tens of thousands out of pocket due to always picking up the bill and bailing him out, and believe me when I say, all those small amounts quickly add up to big sums. \n\nAt that point, the resentment will set in and the relationship will suffer immeasurably. Plus you'll likely never recoup all that hard earned money that you've put in. \n\n A seemingly small argument has thrown up a big red flag that you shouldn't ignore.\n\nThis situation deserves some serious thought, and you need to work out if you're prepared to carry this guy indefinitely through life, because change and advancement doesn't seem to be high on his list of priorities with the attitude he has shown \ud83e\udd14 Sorry to sound so negative, but I've seen it play out enough times to know where its headed, if you allow it to continue.", "This.  I do okay, I have bills and struggle sometimes, but I don't expect my more well off friends to pamper me and pay for me.  One good friend makes over 3 times my pay, and has been very generous at times, but never have I asked him to be generous, or to pay my way.\n\nI've tried to reciprocate when I can, but that's what friends are for.  they aren't supposed to be a meal ticket, just because they excel at life.", " I definitely see where you're coming from. I will give it a lot of though. I think I have a hard time sweating standards ina relationship because of my upbringing and unhealthy attachment styles, but I'm learning I suppose and being patient with myself.", "For me, these specifics are the reason you're NTA. To be clear, there is such thing as being so rich that it's very rude to ask people to split the check with you, but you aren't that rich. My financial situation also changed a lot over the course of my life, and I know how hard it is to maintain a sense of perspective when your finances change so rapidly. Going from poverty to 70k/year from two jobs feels like you've made it at, but the reality is that, especially if this is a recent development, you're probably still just one or two minor crises away from being back in a really vulnerable position. It's hard to convey that to people who are worse off financially, and it's important to be compassionate about the ways the situation is awkward or difficult for friends who have less. That said, you're definitely NTA for continuing to be cautious about spending and investing in your own security first.", "Honestly, you need a better boyfriend. It sounds like you've escaped a shitty situation physically but not necessarily mentally.

Will you be happy with this guy in 10 years?", "You have the serious job where you make the money, and he has the fun job where he rarely works and doesn't make much money. He's telling you that he expects you to work your butt off to provide for him because he likes to hardly work or make money. This situation will not change and he will never be able to fully provide for himself. You need to decide if you want a full partner or a dependent.", "You should be upset! I\u2019m upset for you just reading about it. You don\u2019t need this leech.", "There are cases in which someone *can* afford to go to a restaurant, but *can't* afford to split the cost of multiple drinks and appetizers they neither ordered nor ate, and from what I've seen of a lot of the online discourse, a lot of times it might be the people *with* money who want to just split the bill evenly, regardless of what each person ordered. There are also cases where someone who can't really afford it will try to decline but get pressured into coming. \n\nWe need to normalize saying, \"That's outside my budget right now,\" *and* accepting that as a response from people. And checks really should just be split according to what each person orders.", "You've never known someone who doesn't work, where the reason IS laziness? These people do exsist.", "Man I feel this comment. Not for me, I was mostly lucky af growing up and had healthy love and respect modeled for me by most adults in my life (my dads anger issues aside). But one of my former closest friends did not, even though she grew up privileged in other ways. Her life took a rough turn a few years ago and the spiraling ever since has driven a huge wedge between us. RN she\u2019s in no place to see peace as healthy, instead it makes her uncomfortable and she goes back to choosing bad people and bad habits cause it feels \u201cnormal\u201d. She\u2019s well off and has the time and the money to work on this stuff, but she\u2019s terrified and it\u2019s pushed most of the people in her life away. I keep hoping she will do the hard work and come through the other side. But for now my presence in her life seems to be a trigger and her presence in my life played a role in the deepest depressive episode I\u2019ve ever experienced. I\u2019ll always love her, but for now all I can do is say I\u2019ll be there if anything truly awful happens and hope she reaches out when she\u2019s ready. I\u2019m so angry and hurt but I know she\u2019s going through a lot more than I am so all I can do is wait in the wings. No amount of support from me is going to help her change rn. There is nothing I can say that she doesn\u2019t assume comes from a place of control (cause I have conveniently replaced her mom in her head) so space it is. At least she seems to actually be going to therapy this time and sticking with it.", "Ha, I don't have real friends because we are all self sufficient and don't spend outside of our means?\n\nIt's not on me to \"provide experiences\" to people. We experience things that we enjoy together within everyone's budget. \n\nI feed people AT MY HOUSE because it's part of being invited over. I don't pay for their tab when we go out.\n\nI take my fiancee on dates, not my friends.", "Honestly, this may be a deal-breaker. If you\u2019re already paying for him and he feels that you should also pay for others, it\u2019s only a matter of time before you\u2019re out somewhere and he announces that \u201cwe\u201dgot it. \u201cWe\u201d of course, means you.\n\nHe\u2019s going to be the  good, generous guy with your money.", "This actually already happened once.

That's a reasonable living but nothing extravagant.  I make almost double that and my wife makes 30 percent more than that and still it doesn't mean others should expect me to pay for them.  \n\nThat said, there are exceptions.  If I had family or friends in from out of town and I'm choosing what to do for food and know I'm picking someplace that normally would be over what they would do, I'll often pick up the difference as a courtesy since I'm asking them to spend more than they would otherwise because it's more in line with our level of spending than theirs.\n\nIf it's their idea though, then no, I'm not going to be covering it unless there's some particular reason.", "You mean, when they only work the bare minimum to pay for their bills while they could also work more hours?", "Though I\u2019m one of the people who work very hard and still struggle in this economy, I gotta say that I do admire OP\u2019s dedication after all the challenges life threw at her.
