Why are you meeting people in places where they can't afford to eat? If you want to see people without a lot of money, agree to meet for coffee or invite them to a BBQ at your place.", "Congratulations. \nYou are doing well for yourself at such a young age.\nYou aren't really in a position with your finances to act as a money bag for others. \nSave, invest, buy a home when feasible, progress in your career and build your wealth.  Treat yourself every once in a while to a nice dinner, vacation etc.\nAfter that you can show your largesse to others.", "Im going to go ESH.\n\nI do however agree that asking for it to be split after the fact is wrong. \n\nWhere the ESH here is your reasoning and justification. You base worth on wealth. Some people work hard and do their best and don\u2019t get the break. Others hit issues which cause financial hardship through no fault of their own. Others may choose to pursue careers which are not lucrative but for them entirely enjoyable and fulfilling. \n\nThis statement\n\n \u201cI have worked extremely hard to be in a better place so I shouldnt be responsible for others who haven't\u201d  \n\nShows a lack of maturity and understanding.\n\n\nSo in essence you are both wrong. A friendship shouldn\u2019t be transactional nor should you spring surprises about cash \u2018ie bill splitting\u2019 at the end of a meal, but also an argument that you are better than them is just as bad a mindset to have.\n\nEdit: just seen you are 22 as well, I wouldn\u2019t gloat yet. I know a lot of people that didn\u2019t know what they wanted to do early in life and stumbled around for a while.

Some people will be okay with going out more if they know they don\u2019t have to pay.", "NTA. Honestly hate splitting the bill at the end of a group dinner, specially when you know some people have bought the expensive stuff and other have bought cheap stuff.\n\nBut we'll done on getting to where you are at such a young age.", "NTA - don't let anyone take advantage of you.  You shouldn't have to pay for everything, especially because other people make less money.  Start splitting things 60/40 or 70/30 if he can't afford 50/50.  You shouldn't have to fund his lifestyle.", "NTA. Your hard-earned money, you spend or save however pleases you. Any other people;s opinion about your money is insignificant.", "NTA - I have to say I find your post awesome. I've never understood the concept of simply splitting a bill evenly. And I am coming from the opposite of you. I mostly make all my food at home because I don't make that much money. But if more well-off friends want to go out and want me there, I will make an effort to go. I will just order what I can afford and should only have to pay for that. In my opinion it is so much worse for people in your financially stable position to expect someone with less to split a bill evenly. As long as you aren't judging anybody for their financial situation I see no reason for you being an AH at all.", "NTA. As one of the poorer people in my friend group, it is not someone else's responsibility to pay for my meals. We all either pay for our own meals or take turns paying, but it is agreed before. It's rude to expect someone to pay for your meal because they earn more than you.", "As someone making 4-5 average salaries a month, I have the following approach - when I go out with close friends I know are in a worse financial situation, I have the tendency to take charge if the paybill. Note I am aware they are truly struggling, with the husband working 12 hours shifts. When I go out with people in a far better financial situation than myself, I have no problem of them taking charge of the paybill and even when my wife is making a fuss about it, we joke about it like - don't worry he's in a way better place than me, having no wife and no kids. Note my friend group has no slackers and we all take jokes well. There is no room for slackers / lazy folks when we talk about taking charge of paybills.", "I think the closest you get to splitting the bill is paying for you're food. I watched a video where some guy was young and didn't have much money but went out with his friends. He ordered a $10 mac and cheese while everyone else ordered 30 dollar things. Well at the end when the bill came it was a couple $100 and he would've had to pay like 150. He put down a $10 dollar note and never talked to them again. Little bit of a long story but that's why I feel like people should pay for how much their food is not everyone else's", "NTA. It even more than how hard you\u2019ve worked to achieve what you have. There are people who complain about not having enough money but eat out every night, but expensive cars, buy designer clothes, get hair extensions, go on trips etc then expect you to pay for them after you gave up that stuff to save money.", "By his logic, it's perfectly ok and should even be encouraged to let others use you. NTA", "NTA - I was once in that kind of relationship where mister was jealous I was making more (guilt tripping me if I dared buy something a bit fancy for me) but still was expecting he could enjoy the extra money. I dumped him, and met my now husband a year later.", "Definitely NTA. People should pay their own way regardless of how much money they make. You don't sit around the table with friends and say ok who earns more to decide who picks up the bill. In saying that, when I've had friends who were struggling I've shouted them a night out. I've had friends do the same for me. This happened a lot in my 20's but now that I'm in my 40's it doesn't really happen.  I also often shout a friend who regularly travels to have lunch with me, it's my way of saying thank you.", "NTA. He wants to look like a big shot spending your money", "What\u2019s he realistically going to say, OP? \n\nHe benefits from you paying for meals and dates etc. He likes eating, and he likes going out, and he works sporadically. So, of course his position is going to be that ppl who make less should be treated by those with more money. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA here about paying for others, but I\u2019d be careful with this boyfriend. He should be included in the group \u201cpeople who make less money than me.\u201d Don\u2019t have a separate rule for friends and boyfriends on this. \n\nIf it\u2019s a good way to get taken advantage of in a friendship, it\u2019s a GREAT way to get taken advantage of in a relationship.", "NTA There\u2019s never been a shortage of people trying to freeload under every pretense you can imagine.  You\u2019re not obligated to pay for anyone. You can be as generous as you like, or not at all.", "NTA\n\n\u2018Should\u2019 is way too strong a word. You are not responsible for subsidizing your friends and acquaintances who make less than you.  Do not get guilted into doing so\n\nOne of the things that is nice to do with money is to be generous and treat others to things. This should happen entirely at your discretion and within your means of doing so responsibly and to those that you want to. \n\nIf you *never* pay for anyone who makes less than you because you pulled yourself up by your bootstraps, I\u2019d think that was the wrong approach. But if you\u2019re expected to foot the bill every time you\u2019re out with your friends because he have a decent paying job, then i disagree with that too", "NTA nobody is your financial responsibility.", "Nobody is entitled to your income or assets. The ones who try to lay claim are lazy.", "NTA\n\nhere\u2019s a fun story. I earnt double my partners wage. It wasn\u2019t always like that. He had a well paying job but chose a menial job for his mental health. But all money was pooled and we spent and saved together and did renovations etc. His car blew up and he needed a new one. We decided we\u2019d go down to one vehicle, trade mine in and get a loan. I did the math and saw that an extra loan was going to have us substantially out of pocket. So my solution to him was we need to cut back on spending or he needed to go back to the high paying job \u201cone or two days a week\u201d. He cracked it. He broke up. He did not want to cut back on spending and curb the lifestyle he\u2019s become accustomed to\u2026.. which I was funding but didn\u2019t want to contribute more either. We broke up. And I will never \u201cshare\u201d my money ever again in a relationship", "NTA. If you don't live together. Dump him and block him. He's going to start using you more and more.", "The answer is it depends.\n\nIt depends on their relationship with you, how much of an income difference there is, and how expensive the activity is.", "NTA: Dump him and run! You're not too invested yet, and need someone with your mindset.", "My husband I have been literally on the bare bones of our asses.  If we get invited to a meal when broke we either plead another engagement, or illness.  There is no way our better off friends are paying for us.  If we can't afford it we don't do it.", "NTA. With your upbringing, you should take a hard look at your love interests because you probably tent to take on guys who (will) take advantage of you. If you\u2019ve been abused, it\u2019s unfortunately likely to hook up with an abuser as a partner. \n\nThis present partner works 20 hours, and has zero problems with you paying for everything while you work way too much. Is he contributing in other ways? I bet he isn\u2019t. Does he do your laundry, dishes, provides you with emotional support, gets out of bed to drive you to work? All those little things partners do to show each other they love them? \n\nBe careful who you invite into your life. You don\u2019t need someone who wants a free ride.", "NTA.

Sounds like he is using you. You worked hard to get where you are. Not saying you can\u2019t be charitable, but value yourself and don\u2019t keep choosing partners and friends who take advantage of you. A little counseling might help you to break this behavior that you are repeating from family abuse, old boyfriend, now new boyfriend.", "NTA. I know people who make 10x more and we never expect them to pick up the bill for anyone else.", "NTA. You aren't an ATM, you shouldn't be expected to cover someone else simply because you have more money or earning potential. Sometimes it's nice to treat your friends, but it shouldn't be an expectation.", "NTA, \nI'll only pick up the bill when i have invited that person out, and they've told me they can't go because their money is tight.\nOutside of that, we split it every time.", "NTA. I think it is really tacky to say your partner should treat her friends when she is already paying for yourself...", "NTA real friends or anyone with dignity would insist on paying for themselves and wouldn\u2019t accept you paying anyway. I think it is time to move on from your boyfriend.", "I recommend you stop paying for him and see how he really feels. He looks like a major entitled moocher and I think if you stopped paying for him, your whole relationship would explode. NTA", "NTA, your bf has no ambition otherwise he would be looking for a better job or trying to get an education to improve his situation. He isn\u2019t doing that and probably never will as long as he has someone else paying for him. \n\nYou should take a good hard look at what your future will be if you stay with him.", "Thank you, I kinda felt this way, but I didn't know how to express it in the moment. I still work about 45 hours for my day job and I pick up shifts at a secondary job on the weekends, so it really does make me upset when he expects it from me sometimes", "Also it would feel really weird if you go out with a friend and they pay for your meal. Unless it's like you're going out often and you take turns to speed things up.", "Also, a real friend just gets down at our level at times.

Nobody should do it if they can't afford it and then blame their richest friends for not covering the bill. If I go out I make sure I'm eating at places within my budget range and of course, sometimes I have covered for poorer friends or let richer friends pay for my share but nobody expects anything from each other, let alone blame each other into making them believe they're being unfair/stingy.\n\nSaid this, stories like this one are the reason why I'm low key against couples with noticeable income gaps.

Ii will not just go with expectation to others pay for me. I understand  if financial situation would be drastically different, like if you were a millionaire, but you not. Your bf is a perfect example why you should not fall into \"pay for him because he earns less money\".

Sounds to me like he was feeling judged by you because that's what he's doing to you.", "NTA!\n\nBut take a LONG HARD look at your BF, you should not be feeling pressured to support him or pay for things he cannot. Does he suggest going out when he knows he cannot afford to pay for himself? Is he intentionally underemployed? How would he pay his bills/for his lifestyle without you? What are his plans for the future career wise (ie if he\u2019s busting his ass at school and this is only job that will work around it then that\u2019s kinda acceptable)?\n\nWhen we escape abusive situations we oftentimes cannot realise that other situations are also abusive. He may not be laying hands on your or SA\u2019ing you (I do not know what kind of abuse you had at the hands of your family), but mental, financial and emotional abuse are also types of abuse. Just because someone isn\u2019t AS abusive as someone else, doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t abusive or that this isn\u2019t still another form of abuse. \n\nIf you have any concerns, get out! If you\u2019re unsure, and it is safe to do so, suggest to your BF that for a while you BOTH need to live within HIS means and that from here on out you\u2019re splitting things 50/50 (I don\u2019t mean necessarily arguing down to cents on a bill, but equally if he starts ordering expensive shit and expecting you to foot for half of it then that\u2019s him being deceptive and manipulating the situation).

Our families are just both like that. I think I managed to spend $5 of my own money one time I visited family for like 2 weeks, because I had a bunch of quarters for kiddy rides at the grocery store for my way younger cousins while their mom fed the baby.", "NTA I'm the same way for the same reasons. I stayed home and spent frugally while people around me were going out all of the time and spending most of their money. Now that I'm in a better place financially, Im able to save while also treating myself. No one paid for my dinners and such when I could have really used it. I see no reason to buy them dinners now.", "NTA. You are doing amazing and dragging yourself into better circumstances despite your hurdles in life are amazing. Don't take financial advice from people stuck in a cycle of poor life decisions", "Imo it is polite to offer, especially if you are the one inviting.

No one should expect this of you. Esp not your boyfriend, who doesn't give as much from him as you do from yourself (unless he has some condition that hinders his capabilities).\n\nYou should think about the future of your relationship and your relationship with money. Are you ready to support the man without disdaining him? I can't imagine counting every dollar and making sure every expense is split evenly if there's a big difference in your incomes. I can't even imagine splitting every expense fairly even (even is not necessarily fair) - ofc, the larger ones (like rent, car, furniture etc) should be, but others...? Like food, me and my bf split the food bills evenly (except when eating out), but he eats considerably more than I do (I think two to three times more). I'm not struggling financially so it would be crazy of me to make a big deal of it (I get irritated sometimes though, when I think about how I ate 2 eggs of a 10-egg box and he devoured the rest xd).", "NTA sounds like your bf meant you should be paying for him... he doesn't sound like a keeper if I'm honest", "Such a hypocritical thing to say by someone living off your paycheck. If earned his own money, I doubt he\u2019d be willing to pay for others. NTA", "NTA. You worked hard to be where you are...so you get to reap the rewards, not others. Also, if you buy a car or anything else in the future that you're paying for, make sure it's in your name", "NTA. Be good to yourself.", "NTA. They\u2019re not entitled to your money. When I was younger and much worse off financially, my friends often paid for me when we hung out because they knew I didn\u2019t really have money to spend on things like that and they wanted my company. I love them for that and I would NEVER expect them to pay for me unless they offered beforehand. It\u2019s a nice thing to do for your friends but you should never feel obligated to. It\u2019s pure entitlement if anyone expects you to pay for everything just because you make more money.", "NTA.\n\nIf a place doesn't do split bills, one of us will pay and the others will transfer the money owed to them. If someone is hard up, we'll turn a blind eye if it takes until the next paycheque to transfer the money.\n\nBut it shouldn't be expected for one person to pay for the rest.\n\nMy partner and I take turns paying.
