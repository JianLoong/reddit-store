{"id": 24295, "submission_id": "15mxb7z", "title": "AITA for calling my girlfriend fat?", "selftext": "For about three months now, I (32M) have been working out in my apartment building's gym. I work from home, and usually go every weekday after work and before my girlfriend (28F) gets home. I put in an hour to 90 minutes and get back after she's gotten home. \n\nI've been really happy with my results as I've begun to look and feel a lot better. However, throughout the same period of time, my girlfriend has been getting increasingly shitty about my gym time. Her biggest complaint is that I'm not home when she gets home, \"which sucks.\" I've offered to wait until she got home to go, or that we could go together, but she didn't like that either.\n\nI recently discussed the situation with a friend of mine, and he made an observation that got me thinking. He said that, every time I had tried to do something to better myself, she had gotten angry. He provided examples: When we met, I was in graduate school at night, and she made a lot of comments complaining about how I was out late so often. When I talked about getting a certification for work so that I'd have a better chance at a promotion, she all but forbade it. Even when I started learning French on Duolingo, she complained about \"that stupid app you're always on.\" As I thought about it, I realized that he was right.\n\nI offer to include her in all these activities, but she wants no part of any of them. It's not even a clinginess, because she's perfectly happy to sit and watch television or watch TikTok while I play video games in the other room. I understand that she doesn't want to do these things with me, but I just cannot understand why she's so mad about *me* doing these things on my own. If she wanted to take a class, or learn something new, or do something positive like that, I would absolutely support her, and I just don't understand her reaction to any of this.\n\nThis finally came to a head yesterday, when I got home from the gym. \n\nSure enough, when I came in, she snapped at me, \"Where have *you* been?\" \n\nI got angry and I snapped back, \"Where the fuck do you think I've been?\" and gestured to my gym clothes and water bottle. We argued a bit about everything I've mentioned above.\n\nAnd this is where I may have ceded the high ground. Because I then said, \"Hey, if you want to be fat and lazy your whole life, that's your choice. But *I* don't, so get off my ass!\"\n\nShe burst into tears, ran into the bedroom and shut the door. She was in there while I showered and then made dinner. She only came out when I knocked on the door and told her that food was ready. We ate silently in front of the television. Then, she went back into the bedroom. When I went in to go to bed, she was already asleep. Or, at least, lying in bed with her back to me.\n\nAll last night and today I've been dwelling on this. I go back and forth between feeling badly about losing my temper, and getting mad about her constant complaining. Am I the asshole for what I said? To be clear, she isn't actually fat.", "created_utc": 1691628788, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mxb7z/aita_for_calling_my_girlfriend_fat/", "score": 207, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s why you\u2019re the AH here.\n\nThat being said, you\u2019re clearly at the end of your rope and you\u2019ve realized that your girlfriend has gone out of her way to manipulate you and sabotage every attempt you\u2019ve made to better your life. \n\nThis very well could be steeped in insecurity - she may not want you to better yourself because she thinks that you\u2019ll realize you can \u201cdo better\u201d than her. However, her insecurities are *hers* to deal with, and hers alone and her behavior is beyond unacceptable. That\u2019s why she\u2019s the bigger AH\n\nTo be completely honest, this relationship doesn\u2019t seem sustainable. I think you need to be honest with yourself and decide if you want to continue to be with someone who not only refuses to support and celebrate your accomplishments, but actively goes out of her way to keep you from achieving your goals.", "ESH, it was rude to call her fat and lazy, but she also seems to have some serious control or jealousy issues that need to be addressed.", "ESH. Your girlfriend's behaviour is not nice or appropriate, but calling her fat wasn't the way to go about solving it.", "ESH. I mean, YTA for the interaction, but her trying to discourage you from growing and learning is really shitty too. Quick guess is that she wants to feel okay as she is right now but kinda isn't and any reminder that she could do more hurts the tenuously-held fantasy.", "ESH. I feel like ur kinda in the right and maybe a tad bit in the wrong with the previous things she said. She can be glad ur in grad school and upset at the time it takes up. Some of it like the duolingo story makes me side with you though. \n\nTwo wrongs don't make a right though. Calling her fat is wrong on your part though and is just a dick thing to do.\n\nThis relationship seems pretty toxic idk if you guys should be in it tbh", "ESH - I tell my daughters: If you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all. Regarding your girlfriend - A partner should build you up- help you become the best version of yourself you can be.", "ESH you both owe each other apologies", "\u201cShe only came out when I knocked on the door and told her that food was ready.\u201d Lol", "I was on your side until the end. You didn\u2019t cede the high ground, you completely pulverized it.\n\nIf you have relationship issues, use your grown up words and communicate. You don\u2019t let things build up and then spew vitriol and get to be the wounded party.\n\nYou asked if you were TA for calling your gf fat, And yes, YTA.\n\nIf your post was about wanting to do things to improve yourself if your gf doesn\u2019t support you, it would be a different answer.", "Have you discussed your general unhappiness with her?\nOr did you just put up with her behaviour until you lost your temper. People in relationships have a responsibility to let the other person know what's going on.\nI have trouble sometimes using my words. But if I want my relationship work I have to say things before shit hits the fan.", "I\u2019d say you\u2019re the asshole for calling her fat. I get your frustrations and could tell it was in the heat of the moment but I don\u2019t think it needed to stoop down to name-calling. You could definitely have a conversation about her not being as supportive as you need - maybe you guys aren\u2019t a great fit especially if she\u2019s guilting you about doing things to better yourself.", "ESH. Pretty sure a good conversation about how you feel like she isn\u2019t encouraging you would have solved this without this cruel outburst. You two need to grow up emotionally or go your separate ways because all I see in your distant future if you don\u2019t talk is lots of pain on both sides.", "OK YTA for what you said. Yeah, that wasn't cool. But I can tell you why she doesn't like you doing things for yourself - it's bcs if you improve yourself, you might leave her. She needs you mediocre, & happy to be with her. If she was confident in herself, she'd be happy for you to explore new things & do things that might lead to bigger & better things, but she's not. So you're NTA for being frustrated here, nor are you TA for wanting to do things to improve yourself, whatever that might mean. You have some thinking to do.", "You are too old to be calling someone names when they upset you, OP. For that YTA. But I'm also deeply concerned about the relationship crab pot mentality that is going on with your gf. Every time you want to do something to better yourself, she negs it . . . and you let her? So no grad school? No certification? No new language? That's not good. Now, rather than having an adult conversation about what your friend brought to light, you trash her looks and call her lazy. Cheap shots aren't going to get you what you want out of life or this relationship. You need to be bettering yourself and she needs to be supporting you. Hopefully you make her better in some way, too. Namecalling ain't it. Try adult communication.", "INFO: Do you have shared activities or time set aside for just both of you?", "Light YTA with a big ESH.\n\nCalling the missus fat is always an AH move. \n\nBut, it seems like it's come from a place of you snapping under the weight of *all* the previous interactions you've had. It wasn't your finest moment, but at least on reflection you're able to appreciate what you said and how it has impacted on your GF. Everyone has a breaking point and it seems like you might have found yours.\n\nSounds like you have bigger things to discuss in your relationship. Maybe ask if she's insecure about you bettering yourself? With any luck she's also thought about the interaction and how she might have contributed to it and will be open to the conversation.", "Yta\n\nYoure rude, you lost your temper the second she asked where you were and than started insulting her , you just wanted to hurt your girlfriend. \n\nAre you even considering apologising to her?", "ESH. Her for being whiny and you for throwing childish insults when you\u2019re frustrated instead of communicating like an adult.", "ESH. I TOTALLY understand why you're upset, and she seems really toxic btw.\nBut there's no reason to body shame. \nYou react badly, which is understandable, but still wrong.\nAnd IDK what's your girlfriend's problem, but you should address that asap. \n\n\nOr divorce/s", "ESH - she shouldn\u2019t be trying to drag you down but you shouldn\u2019t have blown up at her like that. Have a talk with her about you are trying to better yourself but it seems like she\u2019s hindering it. Communicate like adults. If it doesn\u2019t work out then it doesn\u2019t work out. But both of y\u2019all\u2019s communication sucks.", "ESH but you absolutely crossed a line. Especially with your note that she isn\u2019t fat. \n\nIf you feel like being empathetic you could actually tell her what you\u2019ve noticed and ask her where that might be coming from. I\u2019ve actually felt the same way as her before, but didn\u2019t lash out with passive aggressive comments like that. For me it was coming from a place of shame and fear. Fear that my partner was upleveling to a place that made them out of my league and that I would lose them.  Ok so why not improve myself to keep up? I am now, but at the time my shame was so deep that I didn\u2019t feel deserving of improvement or that I\u2019d ever be good enough anyway. It doesn\u2019t make it right, but maybe finding out the deeper issue can actually bring connection. \n\nOr it\u2019s not worth it and leave idk.", "ESH - Her for projecting her insecurities onto you, but you could have had a mature conversation with her about it instead of resorting to insults.", "It sounds like your girlfriends biggest crime is being insecure and clingy, but you were outright cruel and contemptuous. ESH, but to me your actions were more malicious. You definitely crossed a line and I don\u2019t even know how a relationship comes back from that. Unless both people really commit to making some changes this is just going to get uglier and uglier, especially as you just added flame to her insecurity fire.", "ESH. The undermining she does is a big problem, but address that instead of calling her names.", "YTA- you were feeling put out by her for a multitude of reasons and the choose  calling her \u201cfat and lazy\u201d as the way you want to lash out and hurt her for it, instead of expressing yourself like an adult. \n\nIf she\u2019s clipping your wings so hard, break up with her. There\u2019s no excuse for name calling. Grow up.", "I\u2019m going to have to say cruel outburst yes, AH, no.  It sounds like you are on completely different trajectories in life, and she isn\u2019t handling it well at all.  It\u2019s time to sit down with her.  If you want to stay together, figure out an activity, sport, or hobby you would both enjoy. Hiking? Photography? But she sounds like a drag, tbh.  Do you really want to be the only one interested in continuing to grow as a person?  Edit to add: NTA", "Yes and no. Your reaction was very human and that\u2019s ok BUT it was also a dick move because even if she was thinking the same thing it was an ambush coming out of your mouth. It does sound like she needs to look inward and figure out why she won\u2019t allow you to try and be successful. I think it almost sounds like she thinks you\u2019ll leave her like you\u2019ll think you\u2019re too good for her. I dunno.  If you want to stay with her you need to be more reassuring but stand your ground with the things that are helpful and important to you. And she needs to respect that.", "YTA only because you told her exactly what no woman wants to hear but NTA because it came from a good place since you just lost it in the heat of an argument because you sincerely want to take this new fitness journey together with her, being each others cheerleaders.", "I'm just going to say this: \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "You should have talked to her about your epiphany. You should have discussed it with her to see if there is a reason she acts the way she does when you are doing these things to better yourself. My first thought as I was reading your post is that she's most likely insecure - that she's afraid you're going to pass her by and leave her behind. You maybe could've diffused the situation by reassuring her that you love her and encouraging her to suggest activities you could do together. Instead, you called her 'fat and lazy'. Damn, dude... YTA. You handled this abysmally.", "ESH ?\n\nHonestly it just doesn\u2019t seem like you guys should be together. It\u2019s kind of a hard call on whose the true AH because her behavior is definitely absurd and controlling but you haven\u2019t truly addressed it and jumped to anger and the \u201cfat and lazy\u201d comment. It just doesn\u2019t seem like you like each other that much? I don\u2019t think this type of issue would happen in a relationship with mutual respect and genuine enjoyment of each other. \n\nI think sometimes it\u2019s better to be alone than with someone who actively lowers your quality of life.", "ESH. She sucks for making a fuss every time you do something for yourself but you majorly suck for how you approached it, you let the resentment build up and lashed out what should have been a conversation between you too. Just break up.", "ESH instead of having a civil conversation about your concerns, you resorted to name calling. Occur to you she misses you and wants to be with you instead of her maliciously trying to sabotage your future? Boundaries need established but if you truly believe she\u2019s actively working against you, you need to move on.", "YTA - the entire point of that conversation with your friend was to help you see where you\u2019re being held back and help you make a decision. It wasn\u2019t to give you ammunition to use against your gf. You were just mean because your friend gave you the keys to a moral high ground. Based on how you used them, you don\u2019t deserve them.", "ESH. I hope you two can make up and have a civil conversation with one another, perhaps with a counselor/mediator. I understand your frustration; I would be, too, especially with the disturbing trend your friend pointed out. You were TA last night, for sure (and so was she), but what you said was a short burst compared to the long game it sounds like she's playing with you.", "Why are yall together with that sort of dynamic at all? You need to have some serious talk about all of this stuff happening. Maybe it's a huge red flag, and maybe she just doesn't realize she has a problem. Either way, ESH", "ESH, I think allowing it to get to this point was just poor communication on your part. Saying something like that was pretty rude however, being questioned like that when you come home, clearly in gym clothes is also very annoying. I think you both need to have a serious conversation on why it bothers her so much. It sounds like its stemming from some kind of insecurity on her part and your comment def didnt help that.", "Yoooooo brother you are fucking nuts!", "YTA \nI would've gone NTA or ESH, if you hadn't called her fat\nI always feel that this is a low blow thing to do, because people tend to be sensitive about their weight and personal appearance is something that is hard or impossible to change. \n\nIf you just said she was lazy I would've been with you. \n\nI think though, the big problem is she is not supportive of anything you do, and rather than stooping to her level and being outright mean, you should be just sitting down and having a serious conversation", "NTA - she is controlling and manipulative, you may want to re-evaluate your relationship and if you even want to be with a person who tears you down when you try to better yourself.", "ESH.", "ESH. Obviously her pattern of trying to keep you from things you enjoy in life that aren\u2019t her is bad. So address it.", "NTA. Calling her fat was not good, but her shooting down everything you like to do, and what will help you, is far worse. Her pushing you down is not love.", "YTA. If your partner is consistently bringing you down, you need to talk to them about it, and maybe try and figure out if they have a self worth problem or other mental/emotional issue that is feeding into the behavior. It sounds very clingy and insecure on her part.\n\nWhat you do NOT do is respond to her in anger and then bring up these realizations during a fight, and then insult them.\n\nShe could just be a really negative person, and if there's no addressing that with her, by all means, break up. But you just made the process of figuring it out 1000x harder by being a dick.", "ESH, but you will never get a loser off their butt. Don't let her crabs in a bucket mentality sabotage your goals. \n\nTake it as a lesson learned and find another \nself improver, and not someone content with mediocrity. \n\nIf you aren't improving, you're falling behind.", "So you are mentioning activities you want to do, you say that you try to include her, did you ever stop and realize that maybe these things aren\u2019t her cup of tea? Relationships are give and take. It\u2019s never going to be straight down the middle, that\u2019s just not being realistic. It\u2019s great that you are going to the gym and improving your health. It seems like you want some sort of validation from anyone to break it off with her. What\u2019s stopping you? \n\nSo you get into an argument with her, and you cut her to the bone with her weight. That is a sensitive subject for people, and you went right for the jugular. If she\u2019s such a shitty girlfriend, then leave. Nothing is stopping you from leaving. \n\nESH. You suck because you called her names like a petulant child, and for not compromising. \nAnd she sucks because she is so closed minded. She could make some more of an effort.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t care how much you think she\u2019s holding you back or whatever your buddy got in your head. What you said was cruel and hateful. You said it to hurt her and you did. The longer you take to apologize the worse this will be.\n\nShe missed you while in grad school, she misses you when in the gym. What she needs is encouragement to go do things outside the relationship. \n\nYou wanted to hurt her in a heated argument and now you have. You didn\u2019t need to do that and you should apologize. Anything \u201cwrong\u201d that you perceive her doing went out the window when you made that remark.\n\nIf you really resent her so much that you think it\u2019s okay to make that kind of comment about her, then do her a favor and break up. \n\nNext time address what is really bothering you calmly like an adult instead of making fun of the person you are supposed to love and care about.", "NTA. Might be unpopular because everyone is going to focus on the fat part of the outburst, but it\u2019s not an untrue statement. You need to decide if this is truly a partner you want to stay with if they never want to grow and evolve in life. Especially if they are holding back your growth.  So weird to forbid someone from getting a cert that would help with a raise.", "Does she half ass everything or when someone accomplishes something or is trying she sabotage it or acts like it\u2019s not a big deal? She might not want people to by pass her but isn\u2019t motivated enough to anything about it. It could be because she was left behind or that she is scared.\n\nIf this continues you could see that you are not compatible anymore. Have a calm conversation about everything and explain that you are going to continue to improve your life. She can join in or stop complaining. \n\nYou might want to have more open conversations with your friends and see what they see that you might have missed. Not sure if your friends opinion matters but what if they only tolerate her because you like her?\n\nAlso, no you shouldn\u2019t have called her fat but well all say things in the heat of the moment.", "ESH", "ESH\u2026 you\u2019re not an a hole for taking that position and wanting her to change her point of view but if the question is if you\u2019re the a hole for what you said, absolutely. Also she\u2019s no picnic so maybe you guys need to talk a bit.", "ESH they problem isn't that she's 'fat and lazy', the problem is that she seems to have a issue with you doing *anything* to better yourself and improve your life. She wasn't happy with you getting more education, she wasn't happy about you trying to get a promotion, she was mad that you tried to learn a new language, and now she's mad that you're exercising. She clearly doesn't want you to be \"better\", there's every chance that she on some level thinks that she'll lose you if you're \"improved\" or become \"better than her\".   \n\n\nBut, there's no reason to call her fat because of that, I understand that you were angry, but insulting her body isn't the way to express that. Her body likely isn't even the source of the problem here.", "ESH. Is she perfectly happy to watch TikTok while you game in the other room? If that\u2019s all you do, then I can see why she gets upset when you\u2019re always gone. If she\u2019s annoying you, maybe you should communicate that instead of exploding on her.\n\nObviously she shouldn\u2019t be rude when you do stuff but I really find it odd that you just blow up with insults instead of communicating your feelings beforehand.", "NTA, she\u2019s discouraging you from growing? From getting a degree? From feeling great? I\u2019d apologize for the outburst, then tell her what your buddy pointed out - don\u2019t mention him - and ask her what\u2019s up? There\u2019s a slight chance she doesn\u2019t realize that she\u2019s doing that, but I think she knows exactly what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s terrified of change.", "Yta- bringing her weight into it had nothing to do with the issues at hand.", "Have you found things she liked to do? You have always asked her to come with you, have you asked her what she would like to do with you?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou've tolerated her pulling you down forever. Move on already.\n\nIt's not your place to be her motivator, because at this rate you'll end up being her caretaker. One emotional outburst doesn't mean much, it was instinct. You can apologize for that but shake hands and end this jealousy and hatred she has been housing for you all this while.\n\nBoth of your life vision don't match. You need to look after yourself better.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019d dip out so fast, and this would damage me permanently. I hope she is able to get therapy.", "ESH - what you said didn't help anything, that's for sure.\n\nYou should looknat your situation and decide if you want to be in it, rather than lashing out like that. I personally make a point to not say things in an argument that aren't true or that Imight regret later.\n\nMy ex also sabotaged all of my efforts to get healthier. I 100% believe it's because he thought if I got confident enough I would leave him (which, eventually was true).", "You both seem toxic", "YTA because it\u2019s never ok to call your partner fat. It sounds like she misses you being around, but she\u2019s also not interested in the same things you are. Maybe you could split some days and workout at home (ones that don\u2019t include heavy lifting, obvi) or heavy lifting at the apartment gym then other workouts at home. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what kind of conversations you have had, but try giving her those example and ask why she doesn\u2019t seem to like you doing these types of hobbies. Perhaps there\u2019s something you guys can do together that you both enjoy. For example, I don\u2019t like fishing. My husband does. Sometimes he goes by himself, sometimes I go with and read a book in a hammock. I don\u2019t have to do what I don\u2019t want, he still does what he wants \ud83d\ude06", "NTA! People love being called fat. Especially women, there are no stereotypes or stigmas attached. You are WFH you got all this free time she is just jealous and tired from going to office and all pffft. /s", "NTA. Your words weren\u2019t great but she has been attacking you for along time and you finally had enough. Don\u2019t stay in a relationship with someone who holds you back.", "NTA, I\u2019ll quote Johnny cash. \n\n\"If you waste your time a-talkin' to the people who don't listen,\n\"To the things that you are sayin', who do you think's gonna hear.\n\"And if you should die explainin' how the things that they complain about,\n\"Are things they could be changin', who do you think's gonna care?\"", "NTA.

Get out before you fuck up and have a kid with her.", "NTA  Your girlfriend is insecure and is scared that you'll improve yourself so much you'll leave her behind.\n\nShe needs to seek professional help to address her issues. If she doesn't then she is going to resent anything and everything you do to improve your life and your going to resent everything thing she does to try and stop you.\n\nPersonally this is not a situation I could live with and I'd end the relationship. Only you can say what more you're willing to tolerate but I'd say making some form of professional help as a requirement to continue the relationship should be an absolute bare minimum of what you should be doing.", "If she's not fat, your insult should have been \"If you want to end up getting fat and becoming lazy your whole life because of it, that's your choice\".  Heat of the moment.  We can't always say hurtful things as correctly as we should be able to.  She still probably would have been bent out of shape, and cried, but you wouldn't have actually called her fat.", "Maybe like half an asshole? It was rude to call her fat and lazy... BUT she is shitting on everything you do for you. My ex husband was like that. He just wanted control, and absolutely did not want me to do anything that might better myself or further my independence.\n\nThis sounds like a miserable way to live, and can't actually care for you if she is so dead set on keeping you exactly where you are in life.", "NTA, but she does have insecurity issues. When she sees you putting in the effort to better yourself and she doesn't have the motivation, she tries to get you to stop what you are doing. I have seen this first hand and the best thing you can do is just keep doing what you are doing without making a big deal about it. If she keeps sniping at you, ignore it or laugh it off. Since you aren't married, it's easy enough to just say adios to that relationship. It's not going to change on her end.", "Just reading the title alone, I\u2019d say definitely yes.

I know in the heat of the moment you said it out of anger and frustration, so for the name calling you owe her an apology. However heads up the damage is done because if she was already feeling insecure it will now be multiplied. \nYou are not wrong with calling out the other stuff, but it would have been better to have tried it calmly, even though she had snapped at you knowing damn well where you were. You two need a serious talk and you need to point all this stuff out, maybe you have grown apart and are in two separate paths atp. So just apologize and try and talk over all the things you have noticed, and clearly friends have been noticed for a long time now.", "From experience I think your girlfriends issue is that she has low self esteem and doesn't feel good enough for you. Therefore you bettering yourself makes her think you will leave her for someone better, because more girls will suddenly like you or something along those lines", "Nta - dude she\u2019s toxic.  You need to find someone with your same values.  Not sure why people are saying Esh.   They know you\u2019re right.", "NTA I guess she wasn\u2019t mad enough to skip a meal.", "NTA.

Her behavior is honestly borderline despicable if this is in fact what she\u2019s doing. I say borderline because she\u2019s been discreet enough about it up to this point that you haven\u2019t noticed. \n\nI\u2019d have a serious talk with her, because this is a massive character flaw that she needs to own up to and work on. It\u2019s a window into the way she views the world and an ugly one at that.\n\nEdit to point out how misguided the ESH comments are. This indicates a shared blame in the situation at hand. First, his lashing out was a result of her transgression, and not just a single one but a freaking long standing pattern of absolute shit partner behavior. This guy has every right to express anger in the moment. I\u2019d advise now that he got it out of his system to turn to productive discourse, but y\u2019all really trying to put blame on him just getting triggered.", "Asshole reaction to ongoing asshole behavior. You snapped. It happens. Your person should celebrate your wins not try to thwart them.

It really does not outweigh how she has been treating you.\n\nI think you should look into couples counselling or maybe move on so you can do the things you want to without her holding you back.", "I mean you shouldn\u2019t of said what you said, but there are some clear issues on both sides.

I work from home, and usually go every weekday after work and before my girlfriend (28F) gets home. I put in an hour to 90 minutes and get back after she's gotten home. \n\nI've been really happy with my results as I've begun to look and feel a lot better. However, throughout the same period of time, my girlfriend has been getting increasingly shitty about my gym time. Her biggest complaint is that I'm not home when she gets home, \"which sucks.\" I've offered to wait until she got home to go, or that we could go together, but she didn't like that either.\n\nI recently discussed the situation with a friend of mine, and he made an observation that got me thinking. He said that, every time I had tried to do something to better myself, she had gotten angry. He provided examples: When we met, I was in graduate school at night, and she made a lot of comments complaining about how I was out late so often. When I talked about getting a certification for work so that I'd have a better chance at a promotion, she all but forbade it. Even when I started learning French on Duolingo, she complained about \"that stupid app you're always on.\" As I thought about it, I realized that he was right.\n\nI offer to include her in all these activities, but she wants no part of any of them. It's not even a clinginess, because she's perfectly happy to sit and watch television or watch TikTok while I play video games in the other room. I understand that she doesn't want to do these things with me, but I just cannot understand why she's so mad about *me* doing these things on my own. If she wanted to take a class, or learn something new, or do something positive like that, I would absolutely support her, and I just don't understand her reaction to any of this.\n\nThis finally came to a head yesterday, when I got home from the gym. \n\nSure enough, when I came in, she snapped at me, \"Where have *you* been?\" \n\nI got angry and I snapped back, \"Where the fuck do you think I've been?\" and gestured to my gym clothes and water bottle. We argued a bit about everything I've mentioned above.\n\nAnd this is where I may have ceded the high ground. Because I then said, \"Hey, if you want to be fat and lazy your whole life, that's your choice. But *I* don't, so get off my ass!\"\n\nShe burst into tears, ran into the bedroom and shut the door. She was in there while I showered and then made dinner. She only came out when I knocked on the door and told her that food was ready. We ate silently in front of the television. Then, she went back into the bedroom. When I went in to go to bed, she was already asleep. Or, at least, lying in bed with her back to me.\n\nAll last night and today I've been dwelling on this. I go back and forth between feeling badly about losing my temper, and getting mad about her constant complaining. Am I the asshole for what I said?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I mean, it sounds like you hate each other so I don\u2019t get why you\u2019re even dating, but yes, yta.", "Yes of course YTA. Be able to have a disagreement without getting petty and throwing low blows that have nothing to do with your gripe. You said yourself that she is not fat, so calling her that was wack. \n\nCall her clingy and controlling and suffocating. All of that is correct and what your REALLY mad about. Focus on the issue. Insulting her body is not how you address this. Show her and yourself more respect.", "NTA. She sounds insecure, controlling, and manipulative. You need to sit down with her and get to the bottom of her issues with you. One of the most common issues women have with their SO is that he doesn't spend enough time with her, especially doing things she likes. Let's face it, most men don't like to go shoe shopping, so the best solution is to try to find some common ground. The things you've been doing to improve yourself are things *you* enjoy, but maybe she doesn't. Have you ever asked her what she does enjoy? Trying to include her in the things you like isn't the right approach. You both need to meet halfway.", "I agree with this comment, but before you throw the entire relationship away, I think you need to have conversation with your girlfriend about how you\u2019re not feeling supported by her.

Couples should not have to be attached at the hip, and she\u2019s way out of line for bitching about his time spent on working out or doing anything- and it\u2019s *very* telling that her pouting centers around things that are *good* for OP. No problems with him, as he\u2019s said, sitting around playing video games while she fries her brain on TikTok. She wants him to be an unmotivated loser, too. Hope he dumps her whiny ass.", "And she missed him when he was learning French, but doesn\u2019t miss him when he\u2019s playing video games? His reaction was shit, but it does seem like her only issue is when he\u2019s doing things to better himself, not things that don\u2019t (like playing video games).\n\nI think subconsciously she\u2019s insecure and worried that any improvement on his part is a threat to her, like the better he is, the easier he can replace her with someone \u201cbetter.\u201d\n\nOf course, calling her fat and lazy fed into her insecurities and made things worse.\n\nThey need to have an adult discussion or therapy if they want to stay together.", "Is it \"not an untrue statement\"?

Listen, here\u2019s why, probably because i\u2019m a suckerrrrrrrrr for self-improvement and i know how it feels to have a partner that doesn\u2019t even appreciate your growth, let alone join you. Keep doing you, i mean if your woman can\u2019t support you\u2026 and grow together, then idk man. You\u2019re 32? You know best. Just speaking what *I* think, from my experience as well. This is not an advice.", "Yes, YTA for calling your girlfriend fat and lazy. \n\nI am wondering about her behavior when you have tried to better yourself. Your friend said, and many others here have agreed, that she is trying to keep you from your goals (either consciously or subconsciously). That is very possible! \n\nBut could it be possible it\u2019s not about that, but rather about the time you spend doing those things and take away time with her? Or you make the decision to do these time consuming things and don\u2019t communicate with her that you will be starting something new for awhile? Maybe she wants more dates and attention but is trying to let you know in a really ineffective and angry way? Does she have a stressful job or stressful circumstance in her life right now that making her short-tempered? \n\nJust a few things to think about!", "I'm fully NTA. You don't sound like the problem. I've dated a few people like her. Some people don't want to be the partner that keeps pushing you and in my opinion they're not true partners. Sure you were an asshole in your response but you aren't the asshole overall. You need someone that's as driven in the same ways you are. Otherwise you're not going to be very compatible.", "NTA. Were you actually calling her fat and lazy, or were you using a non-specific generalization or an expression?\n\nI've heard the expression *fat and happy,* but usually for animals.\n\nIt sounds like you were referring to the collective and not necessarily making a direct personal statement about her. Like, if you want to be one of the fat and lazy masses, that's on you.\n\nIf that's the case and you were being general and lumping her in there or suggesting she could choose to lump herself in there, then no, you are not the asshole.", "NTA.  It doesn't sound like you called her \"fat\"; it was a statement in the context of you wanting to exercise even if she doesn't.\n\nBut honestly, it sounds like you want to put in the effort to improve yourself from time to time, and for whatever reason, she's not interested and even wants to hold you back.  For me, that's not even a close friend, far less relationship material.  My friends don't need to care about the same things I do, or share the same hopes.  But they support me as I do them.  We do not sabotage each other, as your gf appears to be doing to you.\n\nBtw, that's a good friend you have there, for noticing and pointing it out in a way you could hear.  Hang on to that one.", "NTA\nShes constantly undermining your endeavours.\nAlso she's not fat. You said IF you want to be fat - basically saying you're doing what you can to ensure YOU DONT get fat.\nFrom your info, she needs to \"do better\", not you", "I mean in a round about way you didn\u2019t really call her fat.", "NTA. You said something you didn\u2019t mean, in one moment. She\u2019s been trashing you every single time you want to improve something for yourself.", "NTA.\n\nGoing against the grain on this one. Obviously you shouldn't resort to name-calling. You know that. Now, she's gonna sulk around while the question remains- Why isn't she supporting you in the positive changes you're making?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople don't like change. All too often resistance comes from those closest to us. For all sorts of bullshit reasons. Insecurity. Jealousy. Envy. Laziness. Fear. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhatever it is, it needs to be addressed. Because if she can't get with it, one of the changes you may need to make is your relationship status.", "NTA. Yes, you were not tactful with your words, but you know what, you also get to lose your cool. It is unfair for you to always be the bigger person and taking higher roads. Why are you allowing her to control you? This does not sound like a healthy relationship, and I doubt you will grow as long as you are with her. Remember your kids don\u2019t get to choose their mother, you choose for them. I could see this behaviour transferring to the children as well (if you have any). Our environments play a big role in being stuck. For once, put yourself first, and find a relationship that will be nurturing.", "No you're not, I'm disgusted that she's getting annoyed every time you want to improve yourself, the fact that your friend brought it up is even worse, because she's doing it in front of people as well. If you have an issue with something your partner is doing discuss it in private. Also, why does she have issues with you wanting to better yourself? I think you need to find a more supportive partner NTA", "My only question is why is she doing all this?  It's cool you keep up on your French.  Or got certified at work.  Or work out, or do grad school at night.  It's difficult to see why she's against this unless she wants you physically, mentally, and emotionally bound to her 24/7 and permanently at her beck and call.\n\nBut on their own it does sound like control or jealousy issues, especially since you're willing to include her in anything possible.  OP's comment was pretty mild compared to what I'd say.  But OP definitely needs to talk with girlfriend about this behavior and see what the root cause is, if at all.  If she isn't willing to play ball there, maybe it's time to let go.\n\nNTA", "YTA for calling her fat. That was fucked up and you were just trying to be cruel and cause her pain. \n\nYa she\u2019s an AH about everything else but at that point you have an adult conversation with her or choose to break up with her.", "YTA. Your friend is poisoning your mind against your girlfriend. If you hate your girlfriend so much and think she\u2019s your biggest hater or that she\u2019s sabotaging you, you\u2019re thinking like a middle school girl. Set her free so she can find her match if you don\u2019t like her.", "ESH", "YTA", "Ok. I am going against some here. \n\nI don't see it at calling her fat. \nThere is a big difference to say \"you are fat and lazy\" to say \"if you want to be fat and lazy\". \n\nHowever. Your approach to this by name calling does make you a AH. \n\nBut I would rethink this relationship. If this is how she is treating you for wanting to be better in life how 8s she going to treat your kids when they come home with a great report card or a medal of achievement? \n\nSorry bud. These are huge red flags for me.", "Eeeh yeah ESH. You could have communicated way before it ever got to a point that you had an angry outburst. \n\nMe and my boyfriend had a rough patch a long time ago a little similar to this where he spent a lot of time out at the gym when I wanted quality time and we just ended up compromising by giving him time to go and after we spend time together or going with him, but it took a lot of communication to understand that. Maybe she\u2019s feeling insecure that you\u2019re bettering yourself when she doesn\u2019t want to change things, or upset that she\u2019s not getting the quality time that she wants. You\u2019re also not better than everyone because you work out. It\u2019s just a different hobby than others. Still not a reason to treat you like that, but just a thought.\n\nDon\u2019t silently hold resentment against each other, though. Try and fix the problem, but if it doesn\u2019t get fixed, you\u2019re two different people that maybe grew apart too much and want different things.", "ESH. But I have to wonder, why is it that she\u2019s seemingly reacted poorly to all of these things you\u2019ve gotten into to better yourself? I know you said you gave her the option to go with you to the gym, but can she? Does she have the amount of time you have to invest into it stuff like going to school, getting a new certification, learning a language, etc. ? \n\nAlso, calling someone fat when they really aren\u2019t is an AH thing to do. It can really fuck up your body image and lead to a whole host of issues.", "I haven't read the post, but from the title alone, I can't see a way you wouldn't be the A H. At best E S H. I will refrain from actually voting, as you shouldn't vote if you don't read the post.", "Okay, you are an ass for what you said. However, I do not think she is mentally healthy enough to be in a relationship.   I have been married for almost 27 years, and my husband has never asked where I have been. Now I do tell him if I have a pre-planned event. However, I work 40 plus hours a week, and I may go get my nails done, go for a drink with the girls or have dinner out with work people   I do text him out of respect, but he has never had an issue with it. He is my husband, not my father, and as long as we are both secure in our relationship, then we can do things without each other.", "INFO: Well\u2026 is she fat? \n\nIt\u2019s a rude comment either way, but if she is overweight she might be feeling insecure about the relationship with you getting fit and her not. That doesn\u2019t mean she should discourage you from doing so, but it may explain her behavior some.", "YTA. In what you said BUT you should really re-evaluate your relationship because the other person is supposed to encourage you and be your biggest cheerleader not a person who is constantly holding you back.", "Question: Did you discuss with your girlfriend previously about how her negative comments upset you and how you feel like she\u2019s hindering your self growth processes? \n\nIf yes, then NTA. You hit your breaking point, understandably. Your comments were really rude, but i can\u2019t blame you for them. \n\nIf no, YTA. Your girlfriends negativity and comments suck, but she cannot read your mind. She will not understand things from your perspective unless you tell her. and it sounds like (since your friend is the one who brought the pattern to your attention) that it wasn\u2019t even a part of your perspective until pretty recently.", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have called her names. And she seems to be really unsupportive. Your partner isn\u2019t supposed to hold you back", "I'm not going to judge but I think you really need to consider if you want to be in a relationship with someone who is so clingy and needs you to be at home when they get there. Yeah I would not want to feel suffocated like that.", "ESH", "Are you the asshole for calling your GF fat?\n\nOh fuck yeah you are. There is literally no question about that.\n\n\nBUT her constant complaining seems manipulative like you're not allowed to do things on your own or have hobbies outside of the relationship.\n\nYou dont own someone when you're in a relationship, they are their own person with their own interests and hobbies. Of they align with yours, great! If not, still great! Unless you're a codependent mess.", "ESH - her behaviour doesn't justify yours and vice versa.  You both very clearly screwed up. \n\nHer being against you getting better is clearly far from acceptable - yet in return you became pretty rude and insulting which isn't okay either. And before someone says she deserved it or god knows: no. Two wrongs don't make a right.", "I mean the fat comment was a bit over the line.  However I could understand how you were feeling at the moment. To have an SO always put you down or give you shit has to be near the top of the list of evil shit to do in a relationship. Your partner should encourage you to better yourself and do things to better your life especially if it will eventually benefit theirs like the certification you spoke of. Some people however do not want their partners to better themselves. They want them to stay stagnant out of fear of the person leaving them, or they are just evil people with no rhyme or reason for it. I don\u2019t know your girlfriend only you do so you should know by now which one she is. My advice would be to sit her down, face to face, and talk about this. Apologize first and foremost for your comment and explain to her why you said it. Whether or not you can fix this is 50/50 from my opinion but at the very least learn a lesson from this. The first time any partner tries to put you down for trying to better yourself you need to nip it in the butt immediately going forward. Good luck.", "INFO: have you had any discussion with her about the theory that she doesn't want you to improve yourself? \n\nEither you think it's fixable, in which case you should be talking or you think it's a lost cause, in which case you should be breaking up. There really isn't a third option where you stay together without addressing the issue until you blow up.", "So hear me out, YTA for calling her fat and making her cry. \n\nThat said, you really need to rethink this plateau of a relationship. \n\nI\u2019m going to tell you about my best friend. He was always the most chill guy. If I had to describe him with one word, it would be \u201ccontent\u201d. He was just a super chill guy and happy to do whatever. He met this girl and she totally changed his world. He started changing and I didn\u2019t like it and therefore, I didn\u2019t like her. Eventually I took a step backwards and noticed that for the first time, my \u201ccontent\u201d friend, had desire and ambition. He wanted to change. He wanted to be more. \n\nI feel that\u2019s what a life partner should do to you. They help or encourage you to reach for next level. I honestly feel its in your best interest to end things.", "Long post:\n\nI think YTA for that comment, but NTA or ESH re: the wider situation.\n\nYou need to apologize to her for the fat comment and assure her you don't think she's fat, you said it to be mean. However, you did not retract the lazy comment in your post...so you may sincerely feel she is lazy...so that might need to be addressed separate. Once you deal with your recent comment, then there's the deeper issue, which is probably emotional for both of you. Just because you're 28/32 doesn't mean you have all your communication worked out.\n\nIt does not sound like she is very supportive of you. However, as a general rule, if you value a relationship and want to work on it (and providing your partner is not abusive) a good approach is to focus on your emotions, as opposed to calling her out directly. To be clear - that's not because she isn't acting shitty, too, it's because owning your feelings is often a more effective communication strategy and more at the heart of the matter:\n\n\\- I'm really sorry for what I said - I lost my temper and it was childish and mean. (And don't equivocate or explain or say \"but\"...let the apology stand...if you need help, you can look for advice on \"components of an effective apology\".\n\nThen talk about how you are feeling, much as you have expressed here. Tap into the feeling of not being supported in a sincere way and express what this means to you. Maybe something like\n\n\\-\"Over the past few months, I've been really hurt by your reaction to me working out. I feel like you don't support it, even though it's something that makes me feel good. I thought about other times when I did things to better myself, and I realized you seemed unhappy about those things (examples). I said my stupid comment, because I did not know how to sincerely express how I feel at not being supported, and you did not deserve that. But we both deserve to have a real conversation about the dynamic here.\"\n\n\\- \"Because we haven't talked about it, I don't know what you are feeling, exactly. All I can feel is anger at me. What are you feeling? Why do my extra-curricular activities bother you?\"\n\nThen she has an opportunity to actually say what she is feeling, instead of being passive aggressive. How she reacts to the opportunity to talk can tell you a lot.\n\nGood luck.", "The other correlation between these betterment projects are they take a significant amount if time away.  Some people really enjoy silent time together which you playing video games and her on phone but in same space is.\n\nIt might be more that, or might not.  But still YTA for that comment", "You\u2019re both being pretty childish TBH. You could have argued that \u201cshe doesn\u2019t want to improve or better her life and health\u201d but instead it seems like you found her hot button to shut her up and hurt her feelings . She\u2019s definitely shitty though for being negative about you trying to improve yourself. It\u2019s a big red flag but I wasn\u2019t all that mature when I was 28 either.", "ESH, what you\u2019re feeling I t\u2019s completely valid, however the words were not good, it feels you touched a sensitive fiber.\nI bet there are big insecurities that she hasn\u2019t talked about with you yet. Personally, I would think that you will be knowing new people there and wanting them better than me at some point, cause you\u2019d be sharing hobbies with them and not with me. (Yeah, as shitty as it sounds)\nIf you ask me, I would apologize and ask about what she felt and how can you both meet each others needs", "You are such an AH. You should never weaponize words like that. Yes, she sucks and show support you, but jfc, you're mean.", "I think the proper term is doughy.\n\nAnd most expressions of love, especially among the young, are merely bouts of vanity.\n\nAnd of course, vanity doesn\u2019t work without control.\n\nHopefully she matures out of this, but if not, it will destroy your relationship.

We won\u2019t chill for your convenience.", "I'm more than certain this relationship isn't that romantic lol. In fact, it's more like one-sided", "Ya, this commenter seems to be one of those types.", "I think many people address situations on this sub with a \"hindsight is 20/20\" view. Being in the situation, at the time, context, emotions, etc, is very different than reading it after the fact and commenting on what should happen. Most comments go on like everyone is a robot, and the answer is a compilation of all best practices and results. Humans have issues, are stressed, feel emotions, and a million other things. Thankfully, it seems a few good answers address the question while understanding all that goes along with it.\n\nEdit: BTW, love your username. :)", "She could be also perfectly content, but OP bettering himself could threaten the status quo if she was the one who was more of a catch/higher on the ladder going into the relationship in her mind.\n\nOr OP could be subsidizing her lifestyls and is afraid he'll leave when he gets the chance. Some people do sabotage their partners with shallow reasons like that.\n\nAlso, respectfully disagree with the people saying \"well he should figure out if she... and how to\". No. He should tell her how he feels, and if she treats it as a wake up call he should support her journey to fight her demons, but he can't do the the work for her, or if she is not receptive. And unfortunately, deflecting is easier than taking responsibility, which is why she's angry at OP instead of herself.\n\nBut yeah, calling her names was uncalled for. I'm not saying it's not a human reaction to lash out when hurting, but that doesn't make it right.", "I have been exactly in his shoes and did what he did. \n\nI regret it to this day. My Ex was deeply insecure and she weaponised it, then I weaponised it back in anger. Doesn't matter the justification I was still in the wrong too. \n\nIn the end we were not compatible with each other. I believe it's the same for these two.", "\u201cA moment of weakness\u201d is being an asshole. If someone is frustrating and you snap at them, you\u2019re an asshole. That doesn\u2019t mean the other person isn\u2019t in the wrong. OP\u2019s girlfriend is frankly manipulative and unhealthy, and they should break up. OP\u2019s justified in his frustration. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s justified in calling her fat and lazy, because frankly, we don\u2019t even know that that\u2019s true. Not going to the gym does not mean you\u2019re fat and lazy, and if OP really thinks his girlfriend is those things, then why is he with her? ESH, GF because she\u2019s toxic, and OP for being a dick in response. They should just break up", "Wait im nta though", "That's not at all what I said. You implied the commenter was only telling their daughters *and not their son(s)*. All they mentioned is what they teach their daughters. You're assuming some perceived inequality in their teachings without knowing if they even have sons.\nAnd nobody said it's exclusive to girls to not say anything if they don't have anything nice to say. I'm not even agreeing with the commenter. I'm just pointing out that nobody on this comment thread is telling girls to sit down while boys do whatever they want. \n\nIf you don't get that, then I'll just assume you're a troll. If you do get that, then you should be able to see you are making assumptions so that you can be upset about some perceived injustice that the commenter had nothing to do with.", "For the most part I can relate to that. I ended up finding someone that loves to push me to be better and always keep learning. But in my opinion he's not an asshole for giving in to a moment of retaliatory weakness. He absolutely will be an ah if he continues the cycle though. They are not compatible at all.", "Wow, so many words. Thou doth protest too much, lol.", "Fair enough,\n\nI can empathise with that perspective too. \n\nPeace.", "Said pot to kettle", "They put it in so many words because your pea brains didn\u2019t understand it when they said it in one small paragraph in the previous comment.", "Wouldn\u2019t fewer words work better then?"]}
