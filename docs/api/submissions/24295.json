{"id": 24295, "submission_id": "15mxb7z", "title": "AITA for calling my girlfriend fat?", "selftext": "For about three months now, I (32M) have been working out in my apartment building's gym. I work from home, and usually go every weekday after work and before my girlfriend (28F) gets home. I put in an hour to 90 minutes and get back after she's gotten home. \n\nI've been really happy with my results as I've begun to look and feel a lot better. However, throughout the same period of time, my girlfriend has been getting increasingly shitty about my gym time. Her biggest complaint is that I'm not home when she gets home, \"which sucks.\" I've offered to wait until she got home to go, or that we could go together, but she didn't like that either.\n\nI recently discussed the situation with a friend of mine, and he made an observation that got me thinking. He said that, every time I had tried to do something to better myself, she had gotten angry. He provided examples: When we met, I was in graduate school at night, and she made a lot of comments complaining about how I was out late so often. When I talked about getting a certification for work so that I'd have a better chance at a promotion, she all but forbade it. Even when I started learning French on Duolingo, she complained about \"that stupid app you're always on.\" As I thought about it, I realized that he was right.\n\nI offer to include her in all these activities, but she wants no part of any of them. It's not even a clinginess, because she's perfectly happy to sit and watch television or watch TikTok while I play video games in the other room. I understand that she doesn't want to do these things with me, but I just cannot understand why she's so mad about *me* doing these things on my own. If she wanted to take a class, or learn something new, or do something positive like that, I would absolutely support her, and I just don't understand her reaction to any of this.\n\nThis finally came to a head yesterday, when I got home from the gym. \n\nSure enough, when I came in, she snapped at me, \"Where have *you* been?\" \n\nI got angry and I snapped back, \"Where the fuck do you think I've been?\" and gestured to my gym clothes and water bottle. We argued a bit about everything I've mentioned above.\n\nAnd this is where I may have ceded the high ground. Because I then said, \"Hey, if you want to be fat and lazy your whole life, that's your choice. But *I* don't, so get off my ass!\"\n\nShe burst into tears, ran into the bedroom and shut the door. She was in there while I showered and then made dinner. She only came out when I knocked on the door and told her that food was ready. We ate silently in front of the television. Then, she went back into the bedroom. When I went in to go to bed, she was already asleep. Or, at least, lying in bed with her back to me.\n\nAll last night and today I've been dwelling on this. I go back and forth between feeling badly about losing my temper, and getting mad about her constant complaining. Am I the asshole for what I said? To be clear, she isn't actually fat.", "created_utc": 1691628788, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mxb7z/aita_for_calling_my_girlfriend_fat/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s why you\u2019re the AH here.\n\nThat being said, you\u2019re clearly at the end of your rope and you\u2019ve realized that your girlfriend has gone out of her way to manipulate you and sabotage every attempt you\u2019ve made to better your life. \n\nThis very well could be steeped in insecurity - she may not want you to better yourself because she thinks that you\u2019ll realize you can \u201cdo better\u201d than her. However, her insecurities are *hers* to deal with, and hers alone and her behavior is beyond unacceptable. That\u2019s why she\u2019s the bigger AH\n\nTo be completely honest, this relationship doesn\u2019t seem sustainable. I think you need to be honest with yourself and decide if you want to continue to be with someone who not only refuses to support and celebrate your accomplishments, but actively goes out of her way to keep you from achieving your goals.", "ESH, it was rude to call her fat and lazy, but she also seems to have some serious control or jealousy issues that need to be addressed.", "ESH. Your girlfriend's behaviour is not nice or appropriate, but calling her fat wasn't the way to go about solving it.", "ESH. I mean, YTA for the interaction, but her trying to discourage you from growing and learning is really shitty too. Quick guess is that she wants to feel okay as she is right now but kinda isn't and any reminder that she could do more hurts the tenuously-held fantasy.", "ESH. I feel like ur kinda in the right and maybe a tad bit in the wrong with the previous things she said. She can be glad ur in grad school and upset at the time it takes up. Some of it like the duolingo story makes me side with you though. \n\nTwo wrongs don't make a right though. Calling her fat is wrong on your part though and is just a dick thing to do.\n\nThis relationship seems pretty toxic idk if you guys should be in it tbh", "ESH - I tell my daughters: If you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all. Regarding your girlfriend - A partner should build you up- help you become the best version of yourself you can be.", "ESH you both owe each other apologies", "\u201cShe only came out when I knocked on the door and told her that food was ready.\u201d Lol", "I was on your side until the end. You didn\u2019t cede the high ground, you completely pulverized it.\n\nIf you have relationship issues, use your grown up words and communicate. You don\u2019t let things build up and then spew vitriol and get to be the wounded party.\n\nYou asked if you were TA for calling your gf fat, And yes, YTA.\n\nIf your post was about wanting to do things to improve yourself if your gf doesn\u2019t support you, it would be a different answer.", "Have you discussed your general unhappiness with her?\nOr did you just put up with her behaviour until you lost your temper. People in relationships have a responsibility to let the other person know what's going on.\nI have trouble sometimes using my words. But if I want my relationship work I have to say things before shit hits the fan.", "I\u2019d say you\u2019re the asshole for calling her fat. I get your frustrations and could tell it was in the heat of the moment but I don\u2019t think it needed to stoop down to name-calling. You could definitely have a conversation about her not being as supportive as you need - maybe you guys aren\u2019t a great fit especially if she\u2019s guilting you about doing things to better yourself.", "ESH. Pretty sure a good conversation about how you feel like she isn\u2019t encouraging you would have solved this without this cruel outburst. You two need to grow up emotionally or go your separate ways because all I see in your distant future if you don\u2019t talk is lots of pain on both sides.", "OK YTA for what you said. Yeah, that wasn't cool. But I can tell you why she doesn't like you doing things for yourself - it's bcs if you improve yourself, you might leave her. She needs you mediocre, & happy to be with her. If she was confident in herself, she'd be happy for you to explore new things & do things that might lead to bigger & better things, but she's not. So you're NTA for being frustrated here, nor are you TA for wanting to do things to improve yourself, whatever that might mean. You have some thinking to do.", "You are too old to be calling someone names when they upset you, OP. For that YTA. But I'm also deeply concerned about the relationship crab pot mentality that is going on with your gf. Every time you want to do something to better yourself, she negs it . . . and you let her? So no grad school? No certification? No new language? That's not good. Now, rather than having an adult conversation about what your friend brought to light, you trash her looks and call her lazy. Cheap shots aren't going to get you what you want out of life or this relationship. You need to be bettering yourself and she needs to be supporting you. Hopefully you make her better in some way, too. Namecalling ain't it. Try adult communication.", "INFO: Do you have shared activities or time set aside for just both of you?", "Light YTA with a big ESH.\n\nCalling the missus fat is always an AH move. \n\nBut, it seems like it's come from a place of you snapping under the weight of *all* the previous interactions you've had. It wasn't your finest moment, but at least on reflection you're able to appreciate what you said and how it has impacted on your GF. Everyone has a breaking point and it seems like you might have found yours.\n\nSounds like you have bigger things to discuss in your relationship. Maybe ask if she's insecure about you bettering yourself? With any luck she's also thought about the interaction and how she might have contributed to it and will be open to the conversation.", "Yta\n\nYoure rude, you lost your temper the second she asked where you were and than started insulting her , you just wanted to hurt your girlfriend. \n\nAre you even considering apologising to her?", "ESH. Her for being whiny and you for throwing childish insults when you\u2019re frustrated instead of communicating like an adult.", "ESH. I TOTALLY understand why you're upset, and she seems really toxic btw.\nBut there's no reason to body shame. \nYou react badly, which is understandable, but still wrong.\nAnd IDK what's your girlfriend's problem, but you should address that asap. \n\n\nOr divorce/s", "ESH - she shouldn\u2019t be trying to drag you down but you shouldn\u2019t have blown up at her like that. Have a talk with her about you are trying to better yourself but it seems like she\u2019s hindering it. Communicate like adults. If it doesn\u2019t work out then it doesn\u2019t work out. But both of y\u2019all\u2019s communication sucks.", "ESH but you absolutely crossed a line. Especially, with your note that she isn\u2019t fat. \n\nIf you feel like being empathetic you could actually tell her what you\u2019ve noticed and ask her where that might be coming from. I\u2019ve actually felt the same way as her before, but didn\u2019t lash out with passive aggressive comments like that. For me it was coming from a place of shame and fear. Fear that my partner was upleveling to a place that made them out of my league and that I would lose them.  Ok so why not improve myself to keep up? I am now, but at the time my shame was so deep that I didn\u2019t feel deserving of improvement or that I\u2019d ever be good enough anyway. It doesn\u2019t make it right, but maybe finding out the deeper issue can actually bring connection. \n\nOr it\u2019s not worth it and leave idk.", "ESH - Her for projecting her insecurities onto you, but you could have had a mature conversation with her about it instead of resorting to insults.", "It sounds like your girlfriends biggest crime is being insecure and clingy, but you were outright cruel and contemptuous. ESH, but to me your actions were more malicious. You definitely crossed a line and I don\u2019t even know how a relationship comes back from that. Unless both people really commit to making some changes this is just going to get uglier and uglier, especially as you just added flame to her insecurity fire.", "ESH. The undermining she does is a big problem, but address that instead of calling her names.", "YTA- you were feeling put out by her for a multitude of reasons and the choose  calling her \u201cfat and lazy\u201d as the way you want to lash out and hurt her for it, instead of expressing yourself like an adult. \n\nIf she\u2019s clipping your wings so hard, break up with her. There\u2019s no excuse for name calling. Grow up.", "I\u2019m going to have to say cruel outburst yes, AH, no.  It sounds like you are on completely different trajectories in life, and she isn\u2019t handling it well at all.  It\u2019s time to sit down with her.  If you want to stay together, figure out an activity, sport, or hobby you would both enjoy. Hiking? Photography? But she sounds like a drag, tbh.  Do you really want to be the only one interested in continuing to grow as a person?  Edit to add: NTA", "Yes and no. Your reaction was very human and that\u2019s ok BUT it was also a dick move because even if she was thinking the same thing it was an ambush coming out of your mouth. It does sound like she needs to look inward and figure out why she won\u2019t allow you to try and be successful. I think it almost sounds like she thinks you\u2019ll leave her like you\u2019ll think you\u2019re too good for her. I dunno.  If you want to stay with her you need to be more reassuring but stand your ground with the things that are helpful and important to you. And she needs to respect that.", "YTA only because you told her exactly what no woman wants to hear but NTA because it came from a good place since you just lost it in the heat of an argument because you sincerely want to take this new fitness journey together with her, being each others cheerleaders.", "I'm just going to say this: \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "You should have talked to her about your epiphany. You should have discussed it with her to see if there is a reason she acts the way she does when you are doing these things to better yourself. My first thought as I was reading your post is that she's most likely insecure - that she's afraid you're going to pass her by and leave her behind. You maybe could've diffused the situation by reassuring her that you love her and encouraging her to suggest activities you could do together. Instead, you called her 'fat and lazy'. Damn, dude... YTA. You handled this abysmally.", "ESH ?\n\nHonestly it just doesn\u2019t seem like you guys should be together. It\u2019s kind of a hard call on whose the true AH because her behavior is definitely absurd and controlling but you haven\u2019t truly addressed it and jumped to anger and the \u201cfat and lazy\u201d comment. It just doesn\u2019t seem like you like each other that much? I don\u2019t think this type of issue would happen in a relationship with mutual respect and genuine enjoyment of each other. \n\nI think sometimes it\u2019s better to be alone than with someone who actively lowers your quality of life.", "ESH. She sucks for making a fuss every time you do something for yourself but you majorly suck for how you approached it, you let the resentment build up and lashed out what should have been a conversation between you too. Just break up.", "ESH instead of having a civil conversation about your concerns, you resorted to name calling. Occur to you she misses you and wants to be with you instead of her maliciously trying to sabotage your future? Boundaries need established but if you truly believe she\u2019s actively working against you, you need to move on.", "YTA - the entire point of that conversation with your friend was to help you see where you\u2019re being held back and help you make a decision. It wasn\u2019t to give you ammunition to use against your gf. You were just mean because your friend gave you the keys to a moral high ground. Based on how you used them, you don\u2019t deserve them.", "ESH. I hope you two can make up and have a civil conversation with one another, perhaps with a counselor/mediator. I understand your frustration; I would be, too, especially with the disturbing trend your friend pointed out. You were TA last night, for sure (and so was she), but what you said was a short burst compared to the long game it sounds like she's playing with you.", "Why are yall together with that sort of dynamic at all? You need to have some serious talk about all of this stuff happening. Maybe it's a huge red flag, and maybe she just doesn't realize she has a problem. Either way, ESH", "ESH, I think allowing it to get to this point was just poor communication on your part. Saying something like that was pretty rude however, being questioned like that when you come home, clearly in gym clothes is also very annoying. I think you both need to have a serious conversation on why it bothers her so much. It sounds like its stemming from some kind of insecurity on her part and your comment def didnt help that.", "Yoooooo brother you are fucking nuts!", "YTA \nI would've gone NTA or ESH, if you hadn't called her fat\nI always feel that this is a low blow thing to do, because people tend to be sensitive about their weight and personal appearance is something that is hard or impossible to change. \n\nIf you just said she was lazy I would've been with you. \n\nI think though, the big problem is she is not supportive of anything you do, and rather than stooping to her level and being outright mean, you should be just sitting down and having a serious conversation", "NTA - she is controlling and manipulative, you may want to re-evaluate your relationship and if you even want to be with a person who tears you down when you try to better yourself.", "ESH.", "ESH. Obviously her pattern of trying to keep you from things you enjoy in life that aren\u2019t her is bad. So address it.", "NTA. Calling her fat was not good, but her shooting down everything you like to do, and what will help you, is far worse. Her pushing you down is not love.", "YTA. If your partner is consistently bringing you down, you need to talk to them about it, and maybe try and figure out if they have a self worth problem or other mental/emotional issue that is feeding into the behavior. It sounds very clingy and insecure on her part.\n\nWhat you do NOT do is respond to her in anger and then bring up these realizations during a fight, and then insult them.\n\nShe could just be a really negative person, and if there's no addressing that with her, by all means, break up. But you just made the process of figuring it out 1000x harder by being a dick.", "ESH, but you will never get a loser off their butt. Don't let her crabs in a bucket mentality sabotage your goals. \n\nTake it as a lesson learned and find another \nself improver, and not someone content with mediocrity. \n\nIf you aren't improving, you're falling behind.", "So you are mentioning activities you want to do, you say that you try to include her, did you ever stop and realize that maybe these things aren\u2019t her cup of tea? Relationships are give and take. It\u2019s never going to be straight down the middle, that\u2019s just not being realistic. It\u2019s great that you are going to the gym and improving your health. It seems like you want some sort of validation from anyone to break it off with her. What\u2019s stopping you? \n\nSo you get into an argument with her, and you cut her to the bone with her weight. That is a sensitive subject for people, and you went right for the jugular. If she\u2019s such a shitty girlfriend, then leave. Nothing is stopping you from leaving. \n\nESH. You suck because you called her names like a petulant child, and for not compromising. \nAnd she sucks because she is so closed minded. She could make some more of an effort.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t care how much you think she\u2019s holding you back or whatever your buddy got in your head. What you said was cruel and hateful. You said it to hurt her and you did. The longer you take to apologize the worse this will be.\n\nShe missed you while in grad school, she misses you when in the gym. What she needs is encouragement to go do things outside the relationship. \n\nYou wanted to hurt her in a heated argument and now you have. You didn\u2019t need to do that and you should apologize. Anything \u201cwrong\u201d that you perceive her doing went out the window when you made that remark.\n\nIf you really resent her so much that you think it\u2019s okay to make that kind of comment about her, then do her a favor and break up. \n\nNext time address what is really bothering you calmly like an adult instead of making fun of the person you are supposed to love and care about.", "NTA. Might be unpopular because everyone is going to focus on the fat part of the outburst, but it\u2019s not an untrue statement. You need to decide if this is truly a partner you want to stay with if they never want to grow and evolve in life. Especially if they are holding back your growth.  So weird to forbid someone from getting a cert that would help with a raise.", "Does she half ass everything or when someone accomplishes something or is trying she sabotage it or acts like it\u2019s not a big deal? She might not want people to by pass her but isn\u2019t motivated enough to anything about it. It could be because she was left behind or that she is scared.\n\nIf this continues you could see that you are not compatible anymore. Have a calm conversation about everything and explain that you are going to continue to improve your life. She can join in or stop complaining. \n\nYou might want to have more open conversations with your friends and see what they see that you might have missed. Not sure if your friends opinion matters but what if they only tolerate her because you like her?\n\nAlso, no you shouldn\u2019t have called her fat but well all say things in the heat of the moment.", "ESH", "ESH\u2026 you\u2019re not an a hole for taking that position and wanting her to change her point of view but if the question is if you\u2019re the a hole for what you said, absolutely. Also she\u2019s no picnic so maybe you guys need to talk a bit.", "ESH they problem isn't that she's 'fat and lazy', the problem is that she seems to have a issue with you doing *anything* to better yourself and improve your life. She wasn't happy with you getting more education, she wasn't happy about you trying to get a promotion, she was mad that you tried to learn a new language, and now she's mad that you're exercising. She clearly doesn't want you to be \"better\", there's every chance that she on some level thinks that she'll lose you if you're \"improved\" or become \"better than her\".   \n\n\nBut, there's no reason to call her fat because of that, I understand that you were angry, but insulting her body isn't the way to express that. Her body likely isn't even the source of the problem here.", "ESH. Is she perfectly happy to watch TikTok while you game in the other room? If that\u2019s all you do, then I can see why she gets upset when you\u2019re always gone. If she\u2019s annoying you, maybe you should communicate that instead of exploding on her.\n\nObviously she shouldn\u2019t be rude when you do stuff but I really find it odd that you just blow up with insults instead of communicating your feelings beforehand.", "NTA, she\u2019s discouraging you from growing? From getting a degree? From feeling great? I\u2019d apologize for the outburst, then tell her what your buddy pointed out - don\u2019t mention him - and ask her what\u2019s up? There\u2019s a slight chance she doesn\u2019t realize that she\u2019s doing that, but I think she knows exactly what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s terrified of change.", "Yta- bringing her weight into it had nothing to do with the issues at hand.", "Have you found things she liked to do? You have always asked her to come with you, have you asked her what she would like to do with you?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou've tolerated her pulling you down forever. Move on already.\n\nIt's not your place to be her motivator, because at this rate you'll end up being her caretaker. One emotional outburst doesn't mean much, it was instinct. You can apologize for that but shake hands and end this jealousy and hatred she has been housing for you all this while.\n\nBoth of your life vision don't match. You need to look after yourself better.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019d dip out so fast, and this would damage me permanently. I hope she is able to get therapy.", "ESH - what you said didn't help anything, that's for sure.\n\nYou should looknat your situation and decide if you want to be in it, rather than lashing out like that. I personally make a point to not say things in an argument that aren't true or that Imight regret later.\n\nMy ex also sabotaged all of my efforts to get healthier. I 100% believe it's because he thought if I got confident enough I would leave him (which, eventually was true).", "You both seem toxic", "YTA because it\u2019s never ok to call your partner fat. It sounds like she misses you being around, but she\u2019s also not interested in the same things you are. Maybe you could split some days and workout at home (ones that don\u2019t include heavy lifting, obvi) or heavy lifting at the apartment gym then other workouts at home. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what kind of conversations you have had, but try giving her those example and ask why she doesn\u2019t seem to like you doing these types of hobbies. Perhaps there\u2019s something you guys can do together that you both enjoy. For example, I don\u2019t like fishing. My husband does. Sometimes he goes by himself, sometimes I go with and read a book in a hammock. I don\u2019t have to do what I don\u2019t want, he still does what he wants \ud83d\ude06", "NTA! People love being called fat. Especially women, there are no stereotypes or stigmas attached. You are WFH you got all this free time she is just jealous and tired from going to office and all pffft. /s", "NTA. Your words weren\u2019t great but she has been attacking you for along time and you finally had enough. Don\u2019t stay in a relationship with someone who holds you back.", "NTA, I\u2019ll quote Johnny cash. \n\n\"If you waste your time a-talkin' to the people who don't listen,\n\"To the things that you are sayin', who do you think's gonna hear.\n\"And if you should die explainin' how the things that they complain about,\n\"Are things they could be changin', who do you think's gonna care?\"", "NTA.

Get out before you fuck up and have a kid with her.", "NTA  Your girlfriend is insecure and is scared that you'll improve yourself so much you'll leave her behind.\n\nShe needs to seek professional help to address her issues. If she doesn't then she is going to resent anything and everything you do to improve your life and your going to resent everything thing she does to try and stop you.\n\nPersonally this is not a situation I could live with and I'd end the relationship. Only you can say what more you're willing to tolerate but I'd say making some form of professional help as a requirement to continue the relationship should be an absolute bare minimum of what you should be doing.", "If she's not fat, your insult should have been \"If you want to end up getting fat and becoming lazy your whole life because of it, that's your choice\".  Heat of the moment.  We can't always say hurtful things as correctly as we should be able to.  She still probably would have been bent out of shape, and cried, but you wouldn't have actually called her fat.", "Maybe like half an asshole? It was rude to call her fat and lazy... BUT she is shitting on everything you do for you. My ex husband was like that. He just wanted control, and absolutely did not want me to do anything that might better myself or further my independence.\n\nThis sounds like a miserable way to live, and can't actually care for you if she is so dead set on keeping you exactly where you are in life.", "NTA, but she does have insecurity issues. When she sees you putting in the effort to better yourself and she doesn't have the motivation, she tries to get you to stop what you are doing. I have seen this first hand and the best thing you can do is just keep doing what you are doing without making a big deal about it. If she keeps sniping at you, ignore it or laugh it off. Since you aren't married, it's easy enough to just say adios to that relationship. It's not going to change on her end.", "Just reading the title alone, I\u2019d say definitely yes. But having read everything, NTA. You lost your temper. Things got heated. It\u2019s happens. But apologies are definitely in order.", "Not an AH, but you were out of line with the name calling. I know in the heat of the moment you said it out of anger and frustration, so for the name calling you owe her an apology. However heads up the damage is done because if she was already feeling insecure it will now be multiplied. \nYou are not wrong with calling out the other stuff, but it would have been better to have tried it calmly, even though she had snapped at you knowing damn well where you were. You two need a serious talk and you need to point all this stuff out, maybe you have grown apart and are in two separate paths atp. So just apologize and try and talk over all the things you have noticed, and clearly friends have been noticed for a long time now.", "From experience I think your girlfriends issue is that she has low self esteem and doesn't feel good enough for you. Therefore you bettering yourself makes her think you will leave her for someone better, because more girls will suddenly like you or something along those lines", "Nta - dude she\u2019s toxic.  You need to find someone with your same values.  Not sure why people are saying Esh.   They know you\u2019re right.", "NTA I guess she wasn\u2019t mad enough to skip a meal.", "NTA. You were harsh but I'd say justified when you have a partner clearly sabotaging you instead of supporting especially when it's self-improvement.", "NTA - you could\u2019ve delivered the message differently, but it was driven by anger that you have every right to feel. \n\nThe absolute last thing someone who cares about and loves you should do is try to sabotage or hold you back from bettering yourself. Her behavior is honestly borderline despicable if this is in fact what she\u2019s doing. I say borderline because she\u2019s been discreet enough about it up to this point that you haven\u2019t noticed. \n\nI\u2019d have a serious talk with her, because this is a massive character flaw that she needs to own up to and work on. It\u2019s a window into the way she views the world and an ugly one at that.\n\nEdit to point out how misguided the ESH comments are. This indicates a shared blame in the situation at hand. First, his lashing out was a result of her transgression, and not just a single one but a freaking long standing pattern of absolute shit partner behavior. This guy has every right to express anger in the moment. I\u2019d advise now that he got it out of his system to turn to productive discourse, but y\u2019all really trying to put blame on him just getting triggered.", "Asshole reaction to ongoing asshole behavior. You snapped. It happens. Your person should celebrate your wins not try to thwart them. NTA and be with someone who is your cheerleader, your support system, and encourages you to be the best version of yourself. Do not be with someone who squashes your dreams and goals and accomplishments bc they can't be motivated enough to reach goals of their own outside of plopping in front of reality TV and social media all day.", "NTA\n\nHonestly using the word \"fat\" shouldn't be the focus here over the constant derision you have been dealing with. It really does not outweigh how she has been treating you.\n\nI think you should look into couples counselling or maybe move on so you can do the things you want to without her holding you back.", "I mean you shouldn\u2019t of said what you said, but there are some clear issues on both sides. NTA in my opinion. Definitely rude though.", "Maybe she's worried youll get attention from others if you look good snd earn good money, naybe she's sabotaging you to keep you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I work from home, and usually go every weekday after work and before my girlfriend (28F) gets home. I put in an hour to 90 minutes and get back after she's gotten home. \n\nI've been really happy with my results as I've begun to look and feel a lot better. However, throughout the same period of time, my girlfriend has been getting increasingly shitty about my gym time. Her biggest complaint is that I'm not home when she gets home, \"which sucks.\" I've offered to wait until she got home to go, or that we could go together, but she didn't like that either.\n\nI recently discussed the situation with a friend of mine, and he made an observation that got me thinking. He said that, every time I had tried to do something to better myself, she had gotten angry. He provided examples: When we met, I was in graduate school at night, and she made a lot of comments complaining about how I was out late so often. When I talked about getting a certification for work so that I'd have a better chance at a promotion, she all but forbade it. Even when I started learning French on Duolingo, she complained about \"that stupid app you're always on.\" As I thought about it, I realized that he was right.\n\nI offer to include her in all these activities, but she wants no part of any of them. It's not even a clinginess, because she's perfectly happy to sit and watch television or watch TikTok while I play video games in the other room. I understand that she doesn't want to do these things with me, but I just cannot understand why she's so mad about *me* doing these things on my own. If she wanted to take a class, or learn something new, or do something positive like that, I would absolutely support her, and I just don't understand her reaction to any of this.\n\nThis finally came to a head yesterday, when I got home from the gym. \n\nSure enough, when I came in, she snapped at me, \"Where have *you* been?\" \n\nI got angry and I snapped back, \"Where the fuck do you think I've been?\" and gestured to my gym clothes and water bottle. We argued a bit about everything I've mentioned above.\n\nAnd this is where I may have ceded the high ground. Because I then said, \"Hey, if you want to be fat and lazy your whole life, that's your choice. But *I* don't, so get off my ass!\"\n\nShe burst into tears, ran into the bedroom and shut the door. She was in there while I showered and then made dinner. She only came out when I knocked on the door and told her that food was ready. We ate silently in front of the television. Then, she went back into the bedroom. When I went in to go to bed, she was already asleep. Or, at least, lying in bed with her back to me.\n\nAll last night and today I've been dwelling on this. I go back and forth between feeling badly about losing my temper, and getting mad about her constant complaining. Am I the asshole for what I said?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Be able to have a disagreement without getting petty and throwing low blows that have nothing to do with your gripe. You said yourself that she is not fat, so calling her that was wack. \n\nCall her clingy and controlling and suffocating. All of that is correct and what your REALLY mad about. Focus on the issue. Insulting her body is not how you address this. Show her and yourself more respect.", "NTA. She sounds insecure, controlling, and manipulative. You need to sit down with her and get to the bottom of her issues with you. One of the most common issues women have with their SO is that he doesn't spend enough time with her, especially doing things she likes. Let's face it, most men don't like to go shoe shopping, so the best solution is to try to find some common ground. The things you've been doing to improve yourself are things *you* enjoy, but maybe she doesn't. Have you ever asked her what she does enjoy? Trying to include her in the things you like isn't the right approach. You both need to meet halfway.", "I agree with this comment, but before you throw the entire relationship away, I think you need to have conversation with your girlfriend about how you\u2019re not feeling supported by her. She may not realize she\u2019s even doing it and addressing it head on with her may change her behavior. If she reacts poorly, then it might be time to walk away.", "This should be top comment. Well said. Very thoughtful.", "So nta!  He\u2019s right he needs to leave!!!", "She\u2019s aweful - they need to end this.  He\u2019s going to date some hoties", "Do you tell your sons the same?", "You think she should stay with the big girl?", "I shouldn\u2019t have laughed at this, but I did.

What\u2019s stopping OP from leaving?", "Someone give this man an award", "Agree. Break up with someone before you call them \u201cfat and lazy\u201d if it\u2019s as bad as you describe. This relationship is over now, though. Wouldn\u2019t call the guy TA if he got fed up with the bad treatment and dumped her. But wow that\u2019s a very cruel thing to say and you cede the high ground when you talk to someone that way.", "So what if they aren\u2019t her cup of tea? Couples should not have to be attached at the hip, and she\u2019s way out of line for bitching about his time spent on working out or doing anything- and it\u2019s *very* telling that her pouting centers around things that are *good* for OP. No problems with him, as he\u2019s said, sitting around playing video games while she fries her brain on TikTok. She wants him to be an unmotivated loser, too. Hope he dumps her whiny ass.", "And she missed him when he was learning French, but doesn\u2019t miss him when he\u2019s playing video games? His reaction was shit, but it does seem like her only issue is when he\u2019s doing things to better himself, not things that don\u2019t (like playing video games).\n\nI think subconsciously she\u2019s insecure and worried that any improvement on his part is a threat to her, like the better he is, the easier he can replace her with someone \u201cbetter.\u201d\n\nOf course, calling her fat and lazy fed into her insecurities and made things worse.\n\nThey need to have an adult discussion or therapy if they want to stay together.", "Is it \"not an untrue statement\"? OP hasn't given any indication of what his girlfriend actually looks like. Some people think that 5'5\" and 130lbs is fat", "Being fat isn\u2019t a crime.  He just isn\u2019t into fat chicks.", "It is an untrue statement. He says she\u2019s not actually fat.", "Don\u2019t apologise. A real man makes her admit he was right, an apology is too submissive.", "Yep", "While he never should have gone for her weight, this point will never stand.

She\u2019s extremely insecure and doesn\u2019t want him to better himself as she would have to look deeper into her life. I don\u2019t think she likes what she sees.", "She\u2019s not fat.
