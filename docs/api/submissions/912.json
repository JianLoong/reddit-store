Five years ago, there was a car accident and my older sister (will call her Natalie) got banged up very badly. Most of it she got better from but she's mute now from damage to her vocal cords.\n\nNatalie gets by very well with sign language, however, our parents have always refused to actually learn ASL. They always insisted that Natalie could write anything out, that text-to-speech was good enough if she didn't want to carry around a pen and paper. Most of her teachers were like that too, but I get it for them, she's just one student and they're busy. These are our parents.\n\nNatalie and I face-time a lot, because I *did* learn sign for her and it's how she prefers to communicate. She texts my parents okay, but my parents want to use text to replace the long phone-calls *they* had with their parents when they went away to college and Natalie doesn't want to just sit around and text with our parents for hours at a time. They expect her to be sitting on the couch with the phone and replying as fast as possible in real time, and she's not interested.\n\nI overheard my parents complaining about this and insulting Natalie for it, and I blew up at them. I pointed out everyone who'd learned sign for Natalie-me, multiple cousins, our grandparents, multiple aunts and uncles, the two boyfriends she had after the accident (one of whom cheated on her so he wasn't exactly prince charming but he still *learned*), her current girlfriend, and her creative writing teacher in high school. So many people learned to sign for her, but never *them*.\n\nMy parents got really angry at me and told me I couldn't understand, then grounded me. Then both of their sisters, who never agree on *anything*, called to tear into me. They told me that my parents both worked full time, had three kids to raise, both had church responsibilities, and that Natalie and I were brats for expecting them to learn a new language on top of that. They sarcastically asked me what clubs and sports me and our little sister should have lost so my parents could spend time learning a new language when Natalie's hands worked fine.\n\nMy aunts never agree on *anything*. We can't have activities with both sides of the family because they're so bad. But they both agree that Natalie and I are awful.

I think they could find time to learn ASL for her. There\u2019s no set time frame for fluency, I found anywhere from 60-90 hours to years. But wow- they can\u2019t even sign \u201cI love you\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m proud of you\u201d", "Church responsibilities, eh?\n\nTimothy 5:8\nBut if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You are right; Natalie\u2019s right; your parents really were very poor parents in both refusing to spend time learning and in blaming either of you. Their demands on Natalie to spend hours tethered to a phone are also ridiculous. They had to work, yes; they also chose to prioritize church time over their child\u2019s well-being. Work wasn\u2019t optional; church \u201cresponsibility\u201d was. They are attacking and recruiting the aggressive aunties to displace their guilt.\n\nI also refuse to believe that they actually did that back in school - what; they tied up the dorm wall phone for hours back when the norm was NOT these hyperintense helicopter parenting relationships? Reallllly?", "NTA - I think your parents are just being defensive here. Well done you for learning ASL for your sister. You sound like a really good brother.", "NTA. They\u2019re choosing to alienate their daughter by refusing to learn the only language she can speak fluently, quickly. They sound like truly selfish people using excuses to justify their shitty behavior. Your sister is lucky to have you in her corner.", "NTA  If your parents really want to communicate with Natalie, they will learn to do so.  Attempting to learn ASL is the bare minimum.  Text and text to speech are stop gaps at best.  \n\nIf they do not want to even try, then they are pushing the entire burden onto Natalie--which gives them no room to complain if she decides that it is too much.  Besides, Natalie was the one who was hurt--where is the empathy???  \n\nBottomline, their behavior is extremely selfish (and pushing into bullying) and they are just upset at being called out about it.  And, let me guess, neither of the aunts who are on their side have bothered either?", "NTA\n\nYou parents and aunts are absolutely in the wrong here. Everyone who you listed that learned ASL is busy, but they all still found the time to do it. Your parents could too if they wanted to but they are 100% too lazy. They say they have 3 children to raise? Well first off they only have 2 to raise since Natalie is an adult, but if they do consider raising her to be part of their responsibility still then learning the language she best communicates in is part of doing that.\n\nIt is also pretty ridiculous for them to ground you for pointing this all out to them. They could disagree if they like, but what basis did they have to ground you? All you did is state your opinion that it is shitty of them to insult Natalie for wanting to use ASL instead of texting and tell them many other people have learned the language. That absolutely doesn't call for a grounding.\n\nLastly, church responsibilities eh? Sounds like your parents need to study some more church teachings around compassion and service to others.", "I cannot imagine a parent not giving something up to accommodate a child who lost their ability to speak. I\u2019m floored at their insensitivity.\n\nYou\u2019re right. \n\nNTA", "If my kids woke up and could only communicate in Klingon, then you'd best believe I'm learning how to speak it too. That's part of being a parent, NTA", "NTA -- I can't even hypothetically conceive of a situation where my parents refuse to learn sign language to communicate with me if I had lost my speech, so I should just consider myself fortunate. Just wow...", "For what it's worth, I don't think you are unreasonable. The very fact that all these people learned ASL for your sister shows that it can be done. \n\nAnd what's the text-to-speech thing about?? That means that they could message her using speech to text, which is easier than texting with their hands; but she has to text with her hands because she doesn't have any other options? So she does all the texting, and if they use speech to text, they don't have to do any of it? If that's the case, then they are utter, utter assholes. \n\nIf they are sitting on their couch with their phones texting enthusiastically with two thumbs then I am slightly less unsympathetic, but if they want to have longer conversations with their daughter, then they should probably consider making it easier for her to have long conversations with them. There is still time to learn ASL. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  It's true that they don't *have to* learn sign language.  No one is going to make them.  But they don't then also get to decide that Natalie *has to* text them for hours on end.  They do get to choose, and the choice is between learning sign language, or having less communication with Natalie.", "NTA i think they needed to hear it and to see that you are ashamed of them. They have had 5 years and haven\u2019t even tried to learn sign language. Your sister isn\u2019t continue sitting texting them for hours for ever. Your a good brother.", "NTA.  Your parents suck.  I cannot imagine my child suffering such a blow to her world and doing absolutely nothing to try and accommodate this situation.  Clearly there are more caring family members and friends around.  You're grounded because they know you're right and it eats at their subconscious.", "Majorly NTA. \n\nYour parents are wild", "NTA. You're parents can't have it both ways. They can learn sign language and fully communicate with their daughter OR they can refuse to learn and then have limited text based communication. Tell aunts and parents that sure they can do whatever they want, but then they shouldn't complain or feel hurt when Natalie starts further limiting her texting, especially as she gets older and busier with her life.", "Major league NTA. Shame on your AH parents.", "NTA ~ when my BFF learned her daughter was deaf, we ALL learned ASL. I\u2019m mid forties and I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s a bit harder to learn languages at this age\u2026.. but I\u2019d do it again for my bestie. My kids are teenagers and they just magically picked it up after a couple months\u2026\u2026without anyone asking them. I\u2019m literally trying to think of anyone in Sam\u2019s life who *refused* to learn a language to communicate with her and I can\u2019t come up with a single person. \n\nHow incredibly sad for your sister. Idek what to say. Hugs to you both.", "NTA, of course.\n\nYour parents should have been in class right next to your sister when she first learned sign language.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. if your parents cared they would have learned.  They won\u2019t learn so they need to deal with the reality that they won\u2019t get the same connection.  Hopefully your sister just starts minimizing contact and they get the hint. But no your parents are wrong here.", "NTA\n\nThey really told you, they didnt wanted to learn to communicate to there daughter because of the church?\n\nYou should get out of there.", "NTA\nThey are angry that it is being pointed out that they don't care to learn a new language to make it easier to communicate with your sister.  And they wouldn't be the assholes if they weren't insulting her for not communicating the way they are demanding.  Sadly, they are making a choice that will impact their relationship with your sister, but that's a choice they get to make.\n\nI don't think you need to apologize for the content and meaning of what you said.  You could apologize for screaming or whatever if you feel it's needed.  But what you've said is true.  They don't care to learn to communicate in Natalie's preferred method and that means their communication is limited because she doesn't care to communicate in your parents preferred method. \n\nBe prepared that they don't feel they've done anything wrong and that fighting about it further with them is unlikely to change their perspective.", "Your parents are lazy. Tell them to grow up and learn asl. There is no excuse not to. \n\nNta", "NTA - That your aunts beleive other activities should take the place of your parents learning a new way to communicate with their daughter is crazy.  Plus, your parents are deciding to limit communication with one of their children.  Maybe you should talk to the leader at their Church, both about compassion and for using Church as an excuse for poor parenting.", "NTA\n\nGlad you somehow learned to understand courtesy and compassion whereas your parents have not. You were right in your approach with them. Being parents with active adult working lives is hard, but there\u2019s no excuse here. They could at the very least learn basic conversation in ASL and also attempt to see how damaging this could be to their child by not trying. It is going to shock them wildly when one day your sister goes no contact with them because they refuse to contact with her in a feasible manner. You\u2019re a great brother, do not allow these adults to bully you into thinking they are not in the wrong here.", "NTA, if they want to talk to their child, they need to learn the language that said child speaks. Or if they don't have time, hire an interpreter.", "Nta. They could have dedicated 30 minutes every other day and learnt. 30 minutes after littlest has gone to bed isn't asking for much.", "NTA\u2026 your parents are just feeling guilty because you pointed out that EVERYONE else in her life made an effort that they refuse to make.", "NTA. \nLearning a new language is hard. Especially as an adult. I get it. But they could at least try, even if they then don't manage completely.", "**INFO:**\n\n**What caused the accident?

It is great to read that you all learnt for her.", "NTA, if they would had lost their voices they would have DEMANDED everyone to learn ASL, as they were 'victims of the circumstances'.\nI hope that you have the possibility to run away from there as soon as you're legally older.\nBlessings from Argentina \ud83e\udd17", "Nta but your parents and their crappy sisters are huge stinky aholes", "NTA\n\nYou're parents sound horrible, I get that life is busy at times but to not even make an effort to learn ASL after five years of one of their children going mute and then daring to rip into you and get their hoard of flying monkeys to berate you is absolutely disgusting.", "NTA.

She's learning basic signs in her speech therapy and while I'm raising her and her baby brother, taking them to Dr's appts (she's got speech, OT and chemo appointments every week) a SAHM and a military wife, I'm still making the effort to learn sign language for her. My husband who's gone 12-14 hours a day working and sometimes even days/weeks at a time is learning basic signs for her. It's still possible.

So the bishop (i.e. local priest) might be the local dentist (with almost zero training to actually be a clergyperson), the ward clerk might be an accountant, and so on. They've gotta attend their regular services, plus meetings, plus various other responsibilities like cleaning the church (because the church decided that they don't want to pay for cleaners, despite having upwards of $100 billion in assets), and something called \"home teaching\" that I still haven't quite figured out what it is.\n\nBottom line, between the cultural push in mormonism to start having a ton of kids very early in life, and the day job, and the church responsibilities - the members (especially the fathers) don't have much time for actual family stuff (especially if they're got a more demanding calling).", "The \u201cchurch responsibilities\u201d was a dead giveaway.

In general Christianity advocates for compassion, love, etc. Then the church adds a lot of ritual. But any ritual that goes against the core values would actually be anti Christian. In this case their lack of compassion towards their child is not Christian. And then badmouth her and insult her, not Christian either.
