Thankfully I go by my fist and middle initials, but dude, way to be an ass.", "When my oldest was born, two of his cousins were born one and two montgs after him. They all had names that started with J. \nThen about 7 years later when daughter was born there were two cousins born within a few months of her. They all had J names too.", "\"I'm proud to inform you that while I was having sex, you never crossed my mind.\"", "Well, I mean couldn\u2019t you have been induced in the month before or just held it in until the next month???? It\u2019s only the respectful thing to do!  /s", "I can't even begin to imagine what the hell is wrong with some people's brains.", "My stepsister messaged me the day before I found out what my child was going to be to tell me she was going to be pissed at me if I was having a girl.  Mine was number 7 out of 10 grandkids on my dad\u2019s side and she wasn\u2019t even pregnant at the time but she was gonna be pissed.  Until that point, I didn\u2019t care what I was having but I was a little disappointed to discover I was having boy #7.  Stepsister got pregnant on purpose later that year (baby trapped her boyfriend) and had the only girl out of 10.  \ud83d\ude44\n\nAlso, in regards to the baby having the same first letter\u2026I have two cousins who share mine and my sister\u2019s first and middle names down to the spelling because their mom just LOVED our names.  They\u2019re 10 years younger than us.  If there\u2019d been a 3rd, she\u2019d have used my youngest sister\u2019s name.  Mom thinks it\u2019s weird as all get out but it\u2019s whatever.", "He could say it\u2019s a nice middle name but not his favorite for a first name. Why do people complicate matters with elaborate lies, when a simple explanation would work.", "I get it and it's hilarious \ud83d\ude06", "I make comments about \"when the Dodgers make the Super Bowl... \"", "Xanthe is a cute name for a girl.", "Nah, the Duggars gave all their kids J names.", "The Duggars have Jana, Joy-Anna, and Johannah, as well as Joseph and Josiah all in one group of kids. Very similar sounding names. Then three of the girls picked names for their daughters that sound similar in nicknames: Ivy, Eve, and Evie. \n\nThey don\u2019t seem to care if names are super close. \n\nOPs husband is being weird.", "This was a parent choice, but I was in the same class as twin girls. Their names were Nikki and Nicole. Their older brother was Nick, and their younger sister was Nikita.", "My uncles on my dad's side ALL have names that start with D.", "My cousin and I both have different variations of an older family member's name, but it's never been an issue because they are different names.", "Yeah, but that's because you are rational. There are many people who act like someone (even a stranger online) saying they don't like a name is a personal insult to anyone with that name.", "As someone who has trouble naming things i approve. Also as someone who was regularly called by a mixture of my and my siblings (3) names as a kid, i approve, because just calling nick if you just need one of your kids no matter which one seems very efficient.", "It\u2019s like My Big Fat Greek Wedding \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "All my female siblings have the same letter and so do the daughters of one of my aunts (All A\u2019s).
