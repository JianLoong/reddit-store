My husband's sister was first upset that I was due in the same month that both of her daughters were born in (10+ years earlier) because \"but that's OUR birthday month!\"  And then she doubled down on her entitled anger when I had a girl (we didn't find out before the birth) because until that point, her daughters were her parents' only granddaughters (many grandsons had been born in between).  Then on special occasions, she loudly insisted that the grandparents had to see her kids first, open their gifts first, etc., because her daughters \"came first\".  Can't make this stuff up.   Luckily, grandparents thought this was ridiculous, and the cousins grew up to be close anyway.  \nShe thought it was like when a new cute kid was introduced on a sitcom because the original cute kids were getting older and losing the cuteness factor.   Um, yeah, our plans to start a family were all about YOU and replacing your kids for the grandparents. /s  \nI couldn't decide if she was that threatened or just self-centered.  Sheesh.  Now I just ignore that noise.", "Maybe she isn't allowed to have a baby... Because someone else's child is still a baby..", "Oh now THAT needs to be a flair! \ud83e\udd23", "That was my thought too. Husband doesn\u2019t like the name and is creating a bizarre excuse. There\u2019s a reason he doesn\u2019t want to ask his son about it, because son surely wouldn\u2019t care.", "Thought of this too.", "Whoever gets X will have to get creative.", "Then you have to start naming your kids like Elon", "The kids aren't even in the same generation. It's OP's daughter and granddaughter (stepson's kid).", "Fundies who have a billion kids might claim letters but I don\u2019t think this is that", "My son are named Victor and his cousin are named Victoria.\nCoincidense, as we didnt have contact with them at the moment. Found it hysterical", "So how big is the age gap", "Honestly while I got that J wasn\u2019t the right letter - my first thought was, Well no one told the Duggars that! [of course they\u2019re a dumpster fire for other reasons]", "Info: are you closer in age to your stepson than your husband? And did your stepson maybe express discomfort with this to his father at some point?", "Come here, Xylophone!", "Xavier for a boy or Xena for a girl, easy lol", "Xander", "Different homes (presumably) but they're both daughters.", "This is the first time I've ever thought about it in my life, but on my mom's side of the family, she, my uncle/her brother, my sister, and my cousin (his child) all share a starting initial. Of the biological children of that line, more share that initial than don't. It's literally never come up.", "Another time I\u2019d shy away is if the letter was fairly unusual culturally for a first name. For example in my area names starting with Q are not very common. So if granddaughter had a unique Q name I wouldn\u2019t want new baby to also have a Q name because it would be too matchy.", "I was just in the process of typing this exact comment. If he doesn't care for the name he should say so.", "Xena, Xerxes, etc. all the classic X baby names. \ud83d\ude09", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "She sounds like a fucking character. Strong principles but maybe strongly weird ones."]}
