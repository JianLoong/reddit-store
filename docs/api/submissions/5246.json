And even if I agreed to call the man Mr., I would take it as an unfriendly/hostile act on his part. I\u2019m not saying we have to be friends outside the workplace, but let\u2019s at least act like we\u2019re on the same team when we\u2019re at work and supposed to actually be on the same team. \n\nIf my boss or his boss asked me to call him Mr, I would. I usually do so without being asked, and wait to be told to use a first name. More often than not, my direct boss is a man, but the higher level bosses are women. I have also called each of those women Ms. unless prompted otherwise. \n\nIt really is all about my station in comparison to theirs when it comes to deciding whether or not I use this title. \n\nImagine if Lebron James started making his teammates call him \u201cMr. James\u201d on the court instead of Lebron.

Women are routinely disrespected in the workforce, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me in the least if Ms. Potter has had her boundaries crossed multiple times even if she is a younger person.

I was youngish (and looked it) and female.  People would ask to speak with the manager and get annoyed when I told them that they were (apparently, I was tricking them???). In my company, people in my position don\u2019t wear uniforms, but the only way I could get the random people I dealt with to accept that I was in fact the manager was to wear the company polo.", "No,  the company has decided that everyone uses first names.

It\u2019s a common cultural phenomenon for people to see being old as an accomplishment and elders as wise or special. In other languages more so even than English I would say. \n\nIf you don\u2019t personally feel that way, calling people who are older Mr. or Ms. could also be a holdover from when you were a kid and you called all grown ups by a title of some sort. Mom, dad, aunt y, Mr. Smith the math teacher, etc. But as a first grader, you wouldn\u2019t call a fifth grader Mr. Henderson. It\u2019s the same thing now. You were trained from a young age that people older than you should be referred to with a title, your brain just only interprets obviously older people as fitting in that category now. \n\nAnd the reason why as a kid you were taught to do that goes back to the cultural hierarchy. Adults think they\u2019re superior to kids, so they aren\u2019t taught to interact with adults on a first name basis.

If this lady wants more distant/formal relationships at work, maybe it isn't doing her any huge favors in terms of her reputation, but I don't see that as trying to exalt herself above her superiors. \n\nIf he thinks it's so dumb that he can't bear to comply, I think his main options are to talk around it like some of his colleagues do or address it directly, explain to her that it's a mismatch with the culture and is off-putting to people (if it is to anyone besides him) and to ask if she could start going by her first name or if she'd like to explain her reasoning.

Then I sign my first name and follow their lead based on how they sign off. If I lose or gain respect for them I don't change how I address them. I also base how I address supervisors, college professors, etc. on what they ask to be called rather than their qualifications or rank. Some of my most respected professors went by their first names because they were also the least formal and had closer relationships with students.", "Oops, I misread that.
