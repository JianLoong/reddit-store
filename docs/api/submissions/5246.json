Thank you.", "I had a common nickname for my name when I went to school. Wasn't really a name I chose it just kind of stuck. Today as an adult if someone asked if they can call me that I say \"sure, but I probably won't answer\". The only two people getting away with it is my BIL and brother", "I have a long name, so I already have a nickname. But I do have an even shorter one for only a select few. I can not stand when someone I don't know uses the shorter nickname. We aren't friends like that, and I already introduced myself by my preferred name. \n\nAt my last job, telemarketers would ask for the owner using a nickname trying to act like they were old friends, so surely we didn't need to ask who they were. Our boss never goes by the name. Only once did I tell them that and said that as good friends, they would know he never uses that name.", "I was wondering this too. I've met people who really don't like their first name and a \"nickname\" they normally go by might not be professional or whatever.", "I had to scroll way to far to find this.", "Yeah 100% this! If she were in my team I would be having a conversation with her about appropriateness and if it continued I think I\u2019d be looking to move her on. \n\nIt would create a weird divide between her and the other employees. She\u2019s not a teacher in a classroom. That is the only workplace I can imagine that this is normal behaviour.", "I\u2019m in Australia too and don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been in a business where anyone is called by their last name in this manner.\n\nIf she had a preferred name, that would be okay but what she is asking for goes against the culture in the company and is making other people uncomfortable. How can you relax and have a normal relationship with your colleague when they\u2019re so snooty about being called Ms.  Potter? \n\nShe is trying to come in and change how  colleagues are used to interacting with each other and give her more respect than others. She sounds like an asshole to me.", "Take my poor people's award \ud83c\udfc6", "You get to decide what name or nick-name people call you. Dennis (OP) is being very rude to Potter by not calling her Potter and he's an AH for that.\n\nBut you don't get to decide your honorifics. Honorifics are dictated by culture, and the culture at the company is to not use them. Her request to be the only person in the building called \"Miss Potter\" instead of just \"Potter\" is equally strange to a hypothetical request to be called \"Madam Potter\" or any other such prefix. \n\nShe doesn't have to agree with the company culture, but then she really shouldn't be working there. I'm sure there are companies still out there that are closer to what Potter is looking for.", "I am an attorney working in a law firm and we never call each other Mr. or Ms. Last Name and lawyers in other firms we work with rarely expect that from us either. \n\nIf my place of work isn\u2019t casual enough to be on a first name basis with everyone I don\u2019t want it. Sorry.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be friends to call someone you see 5 days a week by their first name.\n\nIf OP\u2019s entire office is on a first name basis except this one person, it is a casual setting whether you think it should be or not.", "Ms.Potter is being aggressive and downright rude. You are the superior in this situation yet she demands to be called something formal while not returning that and calling you something at all times.\n\nAs someone who has worked with someone like this: be careful. This person is problematic.\n\nThey feel entitled to everything no matter what it is. They feel as though they are superior to everyone even though they are three rungs down. \n\nYes, is is weird. It\u2019s also awkward in meetings when everyone else is introducing themselves by their first name and she strolls in with something formal out of know where and she is the lowest ranking member in the meeting-it\u2019s also seen right through.\n\nGood luck, NTA.\n\nSorry you are having to deal with this because there are just people like this out there and it tends to be a bumpy road.", "He calls his bosses by their first name why would he call another worker like that lmao things irl are different than theory, to me it sounds more like she's on a power trip for some reason wants to be called by her last name like that will bring more resoect to her name?? NTA", "This is my take on it. NAH, other than I always say call people what they want to be called, but I understand that it's not quite the same in this instance.\n\nOPs not in the position to do so, but it does seem Ms Potter should be asked to find employment elsewhere as she's not a good fit for this company.", "Just curious, did Dicky ever apologize or start calling you by your full name?", "It's not a rank issue, it's an office culture issue. Have you never worked in an office? Because it sounds like it. In every office I've worked we were always all on first name bases and if one of my colleagues insisted on an honorific title it would have been absolutely bizarre. It clashes with the culture and we can bet there are other aspects of her personality that clash as well.", "Mike Doughty is that you? (*see 27 Jennifers*)", "I agree. She has a requirement that others mark her with a level of formality that implies her superiority. He is pointing out that that formality isn't afforded anyone in that business. She's the one obsessed with power plays and hierarchy.", "Learned that the hard way when I called someone m'am while there :D", "I don't even call my doctor Dr. Anything, and I don't even use her full name. She's just CJ. xD", "I call my friends \"Miss Lynn\" or \"Miss Jane\" etc etc.\n\nThere was a brittle high-strong young woman at work who clearly didn't like me (and vice versa), and I would sometimes call her \"Miss Hannah\" to sort of warm the relationship up because it's what I call friends.\n\nShe sent me a long, tense, furious email that she had clearly rewritten multiple times to tell me that it was disrespectful and patronizing of her youth. Which, out of context, I sort of get, but I was just addressing her as I address my friends. And she could have just said/IM'd \"not loving the 'Miss Hannah, please stop' and I would have stopped immediately, instead of a formal email that she was clearly sending/planning to send to HR\n\nDue to the furious tone of the email, I stopped talking to her at all and responded to emails with only the bare minimum necessary so as not to piss her off further.  Thank god she found another job elsewhere soon after.", "I just wonder what kind of tension it is creating when even the higher-ups are Lou and Dave and you have this one person who is fairly low down on the ladder demanding to be called Ms. Potter. I would honor that but it may come across as big-headed and snobby"]}
