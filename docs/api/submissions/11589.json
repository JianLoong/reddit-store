At all.\n\nAgain, I don't get it. Why would you eat a better meal in front of your friends then what you had made for them?", ">\tTo allow himself some variety within his limited diet\u2026 \n\nDo you think most people don't enjoy variety?\n\n>\tOffended friend could easily buy himself his own  salmon as soon as he got home from the trip.\n\nDo you think this is what it's about?

Hence the term pescatarian?? Did your eyes gloss over that?", "are the other 5 meat options OP brought....not variety?", "actually, it's more like....a camping trip where OP brought 6 different kinds of meat for his friends and 2 for himself, then paid for and cooked all the food.", "An aesthetic physician who is only active in AITA...\n\nAnd r/teenagers.\n\nQuit your bullshit.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/11dkmjt/bro_ive_had_a_crush_on_her_since_3rd_grade_and/jaagjt6/\n\n6 days ago. any other porkies or do you want to just go to bed now?"]}
