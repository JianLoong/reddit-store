Unfortunately, OP's friends do.  So rather than doing any of that, they dumped it all on OP.

OP, this is what you should say verbatim.", "Trust me when I say, ops friends are not like you. They're like my roommate.

I live in Montana, I go on a LOT of camping trips, both backcountry, and weekends at campsites, and it's a basic thing that everyone talks about food ahead of time and typically splits up jobs, where everyone brings one dinner, but tells everyone what it will be so people can speak up if they can't eat it.\n\nAs much as there are rules of etiquette when you go to dinner at someone's house, food is a whole other thing when camping, because having enough food you like and will eat, is the difference between having enough calories to stay warm at night, or go on hikes during the day.  You always tell people what you're making and ask what they're bringing because you really don't want to be low on foods you'll eat when you're hours from a grocery store that definitely isn't open 24/7.  And adding to that, everyone understands if folks with specific needs just bring their own food.  If you're camping with 8 people and 1 is vegan, they'll often just exclude themselves from the joint meals and bring their own food, and no one expects them to share that food, as it's understood they need it, and planned and brought just what they needed.  Or for a joint meal, you bring hamburgers for 7 people, and 2 veggie patties for the vegan eater, no one claims that second veggie patty, because you know the vegan eater might still be hungry.  Only if they're clearly done eating, might you ask if they mind, or if they want to save it for later/another meal. \n\nWe have a friend who's diabetic who we do river trips with, and we talk food ahead of time, he brings specific stuff for himself, and shares meals we can share, but it's all carefully hashed out ahead of time.\n\nIt often works that everyone brings their own breakfast, lunch and snacks, then we rotate who does dinners...  or sometimes if one person is coming from a different town, they'll bring bagels or some other treat local to their city, so we'll all pitch in on breakfasts too...  or sometimes everyone takes breakfast and dinner for one day, or whatever.  The only time one person does pretty much all the food themselves is when it's like my family of 4 inviting my sister to come along with us, in which case she just brings snacks, because we're arranging meals our kids will eat and it's not much more work to add enough for her...  or when my in-laws have their camper parked at a campground for a week, and we bring the grandkids up to spend a night with them (in which case they already have all their meals planned, but we'll check in to see if we can bring something out that they might have forgotten or run short on).\n\nI can't image going out to a campsite for 2 nights and not checking in about what we can bring!  And if the organizer said \"don't worry I have it handled\", we'd ask how much we can chip in towards it and if told no we'd bring some extra beer/dessert that can be cooked over a campfire/something special to say thanks...\n\nOP friends are...  something else.", "It sounds more like making everybody chocolate cake, even though you hate chocolate, and making a single panna cotta for yourself.  And then folks asking for your dessert.", "But that amounts to hundreds of dollars. That\u2019s a VERY generous tab to pick up, no?", "That's like saying if a vegetarian brings a non-meat option to the 3 day BBQ which is full of all different kinds of meat. They should share their limited amount of veggie burgers that would be their really only other option of food then the salad that was at the BBQ.\n\nSometimes people get more and/or better stuff then people. Get over yourself just cause the world is unfair.", "OP is paying for AND cooking the meals? \n\nLike my Nona used to say, \"you get what you get and you don't throw a fit\"\n\nYou need better friends dude", "I wouldnt b**** about any of the FREE food that OP brought that I dont even have to cook myself lol.", ">How do you figure it's not hosting?\n\nBecause it's a camping trip, something you're very much expected to pull your own weight on and pitch in for.  OP's \"friends\" further exploiting him by putting the entire onus of the trip logistics onto him doesn't magically make him the host, just a pushover.  Was he also expected to set up and disassemble everyone's tents, gather all the firewood, and clean the campsite by himself because he was \"hosting\".  \n\n>Why would you treat your friends like that?\n\nThat's a good question, I have no idea why OP's friend's would treat him like that.  It's almost like they don't appreciate all he did for them.  I would never dream of putting the full expense of meals for a camping trip onto one person, or making them cook every meal.  That's just poor friendship and camping etiquette."]}
