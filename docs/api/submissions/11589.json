So i started grilling a piece of salmomn then one of my friend was like hey how come we don't get salmon as a joke\n\nI said I only brought a few pieces for me since I get it on sale at work but I brought tilapia if anyone else wanted fish. He was like oh so you only brought enough salmon for yourself? In kind of a rude way then went to tell my other friends\n\nThey keep making jokes about it but the way they say it and how often they bring it up makes me think they're actually bothered by it.

Why are you supplying allll the food? Do their mom\u2019s still do their grocery shopping?", "NTA, you brought food according to your own dietary restrictions and it's not like you left them starving.  If you got the food you get first dibs anyway, imho.  Unless they're completely incapable of eating chicken instead, you're definitely not the asshole, they're being childish and butthurt", "NTA - you bought food for everyone, and a variety of options it sounds like as well. You also brought food to accommodate your dietary restrictions without bothering anyone else or insisting anyone else abide by your restrictions. You didn't just handle this the right way, you were quite generous. Your friends are being jerks.", "NTA. Yes you ate something that you didn\u2019t have enough of for everyone else, but you 1. Provided the food and 2. Have a dietary restriction. Also, you had more fish just not the same type.", "If they wanted salmon, they could have spent their own money and brought it along. Instead, they are complaining about the food you bought and cooked for them. What a bunch of ungrateful, entitled brats. If you go again on a trip like this, leave their meals up to them.", "You did bring enough for everyone, just maybe not the exact thing they wanted. NTA. They can buy their own salmon or not eat.", "You are NTA. \n\nSounds like you were making sure you had enough given you are unable to eat what the majority of the group can.\n\nI bet if you had a lactose sensitivity and brought lactose free milk with regular milk\u2026 they wouldn\u2019t have cared.", "NTA - what did they bring?  nothing?  then they can stfu.", "NTA. \n\nYou paid for and cooked all the food. No one made special requests. You have a dietary difference. They\u2019re being childish (waaah I can\u2019t have what op has) and selfish.", "NTA\n\nThey sound like a bunch of spoiled ungrateful brats.   They should be so thankful you are Cooking GOOD Food!", "INFO: Did you get money from the others to buy the food or did you buy it all with your own money?", "NTA. Let them purchase and bring their own food next time. You can still cook it if you want but it may stop the whiners.", "NTA\n\nWhile it might have looked better if you had made yourself some of the tilapia instead of salmon, WTF are your friends complaining about? They didn't bring the meat. They didn't cook it, either.\n\nPS: If I were there, I would have been very happy you had brought burgers and chicken. I can't stand eating fish!", "NTA. Why were you the only one supplying food? If they objected so strongly to what was being so graciously prepared for them then they can go hungry.", "NTA you were in charge of purchasing the food, you made sure they had enough of what they all liked, and you brought a specific food to suit your diet.", "NTA\n\nThere is literally no reason why you would be the asshole here.", "NTA. You brought the meat. They can get over it if you didn't get enough to share since you're a pescatarian. Did anyone stop them from bringing extra food.", "NTA. This looks kind of bad because most people see salmon as a fancier food than either chicken or tilapia, so it could read like you were hoarding the good stuff for yourself. But it would be absurd to conclude that you should have taken pains to only bring non-fancy-seeming fish for yourself just because you're a pescatarian. I think your friends need to let this go.", "NTA, but in the future, if you are supplying food, give them a menu. Should everyone want the more expensive protein, then they need to chip in. I assume they know your dietary preference, so give a menu including beef/chicken/fish/seafood and let them choose so you can shop and cook accordingly. I have friends who do this and it works out great, but of course, everyone puts money into the pot to cover groceries.", "\"Yeah, I brought salmon for me because I don't eat mammals. I also brought burgers, chicken etc for all of you, even though I don't eat any of it. What did YOU bring?\"", "NTA Not only are you cooking, but you bought the food without anyone chipping in. They get what they get.", "NTA\u2026but I feel like this would be the sort of thing you guys would have discussed in advance.", "INFO: was there an agreement about who was bringing what supplies and you were covering food for everyone? \n\nDid you discuss with anyone beforehand what they would want to eat?\n\nBecause this reads like you bought better quality food just for yourself when you were supposed to buy for everyone which is definitely rude and has nothing to do with you being a pescatarian.", "It's kinda an A'ish move to make for everyone X and only for yourself Y", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You bought food that suits your dietary requirements, and you got food they eat like chicken, burgers etc.  I don't actually eat cooked fish so definitely would be appreciative that you didn't try to force your dietary choices on me.", "I do think it\u2019s a little weird, but NTA", "NTA, and stop being the only one paying for the food. If you like to cook great buttttt them not helping pay is shitty friends.", "Nta next time everyone follows your dietary restrictions and if they bitch about it, reference that conversation.", "YTA.  Why can't you eat the tilapia and let them have some salmon?", "YTA but a soft yta. When you're catering, which is basically what you were doing, not having enough to at least offer the same to others is not being a good host. You could have had the tilapia, right? So you had options besides salmon. You'll know better next time!", "YTA \n\nregardless of whether you are paying for the salmon out of pocket.\n\nthis is a group event and unless there was prior discussion (clearly not) that you would be buying salmon for yourself whereas everyone gets tilapia...", "I like to cook \ud83d\ude0a", "Yeah I would just be thankful that someone is willing to cook for a group of 12, much less pay for all that food too", "I paid for it, but they each gave me money for renting the site", "I offered to bring food for everyone and they agreed. Nobody asked what I was bringing or made any suggestions. I bought burgers, bratwurst, chicken, tilapia, steak, and pork chops. The salmon was just so that I could have a bit of variety and not eat tilapia the whole trip. I only stopped eating meat a few months ago but I still enjoy cooking it", "I didn't mean anything by it, being pescatarian I don't eat chicken", "Kinda assholish to complain about food someone else was kind enough to supply for everyone.", "He literally has a dietary restriction so he cooked a separate meal with ingredients that he can eat, how is that an A move?", "Kinda an arseholeish move to whinge about food you didn't pay for, shop for, transport, or cook too.", "OP supplied ALL OF THE FOOD. Pretty ungrateful for people to demand his fish. I'd leave and take all the food I brought with me.", "I could, but there are twelve of them and only three pieces of salmon", "Hey I have ten bucks but I want 50 bucks, why can't you take the 10 and give me 50?", "Why does OP have to give up their specific dietary preference? Is this any different than having to accommodate a vegetarian or vegan? And plenty of those stories cause uproar in this sub.", "They had many other options", "OP bought ALL the food and cooked it for them. They all got chicken, OP doesn't eat meat aside from seafood so OP brought food for himself. OP went above and beyond as a host and only wanted to take their own dietary restrictions into account. How in anyway is he a bad host? He literally cooked food he doesn't eat for these people!", "Cooking and paying for the food are two different things. We're younthe only one who contributed financially for the food?", "Hmm then in that case NTA. If all their money did was help rent the site. Then they don't get to complain bout not getting the fancy bits of a free meal. You brought some extra bits for yourself since you knew that your food options are limited.\n\nIf they don't like it. Let them fund for the food too so everyone is equal.", "YTA I get what you were thinking, but this is like offering to pick up dinner for everyone and bringing them a bucket of fried chicken and steak for yourself. \n\nI'm sure you didn't intend it as a slight, but your actions very much told your friends that you cared about your meals more than theirs. If you couldn't afford salmon for everyone, you probably should have gone with something else.", "You bring a good point. If OP brought all the food and paid for it without any compensation then you are absolutely right, they are very ungrateful.  If they all split and OP happened to be the one that bought it, they still owe OP for actually going out and getting it, but they should be able to pick what they want, including the ostensibly more expensive fish.", "How is eating tilapia (a fish) giving up his dietary preference?", "Except for what you made for yourself ...\nWe have friend in a group that doesn't drink alcohol for religious reasons but when he brings beer for gatherings he always asks before bringing beer who wants from the none alcoholic drick that he brings for himself - he never brings just for himself just because he can't drink what everyone else drinks", "Hes", "how does that make sense? so if you invite others over to dinner you serve yourself a5 wagyu and everyone gets ground beef? dont be a jerk.", "OP is on a different diet, and no one gave money or offered suggestions. Of course someone on a specific diet is going to put thought into what they bring for themselves, and if the others cared that much then they should have told OP what to bring.", "In no way is it the same. It would only be the same if any of them also had the same dietary restriction. And OP paid for *all the food* for the trip.", "Except he literally brought steak among other things for the rest to eat....\n\nThey all got free food and OP cooked for them, and cooking for 12 is a decent amount of work even if you're just grilling", "Actually I think it's more like me offering to pick up dinner and bringing burgers, bratwurst, chicken, tilapia, steak, and pork chops for everyone, and then tilapia and salmon for myself.\n\nAnd COOKING it for them", "When all other things are equal, fairness dictates that if you're doing all the work of cooking, they should pay for the food. Your friend don't sound like very nice people. NTA", "No it\u2019s like a group of grown adults going on vacation together. No one else chipping in money for any food and then complaining is ridiculous.", "They are on the same diet as OP just plus a few other things. I eat meat but would much prefer salmon or if someone brings a veggie pizza v a meat pizza.", "No not at all. If you bring the food, you treat everyone equally. Cheapskate.", "The person paying hundreds of dollars to feed 12 adults for *days* including steak is the cheapskate? What are you, a teenager?", "no im an aesthetic physician why? \n\npoor people always make it about the money. what are you serving? a5 wagyu? \n\nits about the principle", "> no im an aesthetic physician why?\n\nI\u2019m sure\n\n\n> poor people always make it about the money\n\n> cheapskate\n\nSoo\u2026you?", "Yep, exactly. If Im buying the food, I would never buy myself wagyu and then sneak some rubbish usda beef for everyone else. Its just etiquette. And cheapskates like you probably wont be invited the second time lmao."]}
