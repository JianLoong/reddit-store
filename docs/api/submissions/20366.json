You told him you were busy, he didn't respect that. And I agree, I would also feel invaded if he showed up that late without invitation. He needs to respect the boundaries you set regardless of whether it was a surprise or not. You said no, he shouldn't have shown up.", "*Anyway, tell us what the letter said!*", "Might be too strong to say YTA, but you do seem a bit tone deaf to the situation here.    Your bf wants to give you a nice present the night before your 21st to show he loves and cares about you, and you can't find a way to quickly pop out and greet him?    Presumably if he's your bf he already knows about your parents' (weird, really!) house rules, which is why he didn't come to the door and wanted to meet you outside.   So you may not be the A, but your behaviour displays a lack of sensitivity.", "YTA he obviously wanted to come right around midnight of your birthday and suprise you. He\u2019s your boyfriend trying to do a kind gesture and you treated him like an annoyance. Your an adult, a 21 year old actually not an old frail woman who can\u2019t walk outside of their house at 11pm like what? Of course he\u2019s upset. I would be too.", "I'm between YTA and NAH. Sounds like you don't really like him or you aren't compatible. \n\nLike it was a one time thing and he wanted to surprise you. He just wanted a few minutes. Also sometimes when people text me, I say im busy. But I mean I'm too busy to text. If my boyfriend showed up to surprise me on my birthday, then I wouldn't be too busy for that. So he probably assumed that busy meant to busy to chat. Also he might have already been at your house when you texted he was busy.\n\nDid he know you dislike surprises? Did he know you were very particular about these things? \n\nBecause to me this seems like you are blowing this out of proportion. He did reasonable things that many women would find romantic. He wanted to surprise you, and show you that he was literally there, not just texting to chat with you. You blew him off and wouldn't give him five minutes. He is probably reconsidering this whole relationship. \n\nHonestly do you think that he might have a bigger gift for you, and decided to just leave the letter? I bet there was something more to it.\n\nSo did this happen a few hours ago? Like have you had your birthday yet? Did he show up?", "He was surprising you on your birthday. This thought never popped up in your head. \n\nNow you\u2019ve made him feel worthless. Like he nothing to you. Of course he isn\u2019t going to reply to you.  \n\nHe probably wanted you to come out for 30 seconds.  Pretty reasonable ask when someone is trying to give you something for your birthday", "YTA how hard would it be to collect the gift and give him a kiss then go in?

I don\u2019t know anyone who wouldn\u2019t be happy about being surprised by their partner for their birthday", "It seems like he already knew he wouldn't be invited in, and it seems like a small ask to be cold for a couple of minutes to accept his gift.  It would be weird of him to show up unannounced at that time if he was a stranger, but he isn't.  Why did you react to his surprise arrival with the same reaction you would give a random dude who showed up at your house?  Why was that taken as an act of disrespect?  There is a clear difference in expectations, and it would be worth it to communicate both of your perspectives to each other.", "NTA. \"Honestly, I\u2019m sure a lot of people would think this is normal and be happy with the surprise.\" No, and I don't understand people who think it's ok to show up uninvited and unannounced.", "YTA This was a one time thing. The night before your birthday. Yet you were adamant until he had to say \"i have a surprise\" and *even then* you wouldn't go down. Not very nice! Give the guy a break, be more flexible.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think he thought it thru very much. He was probably very excited about the thought of surprising you and let that excitement get the best of using his brain.", "NTA, and these people who think you are are wild! I\u2019m married, but there was never a time, in the years I dated my husband, that I\u2019d have wanted him surprising me at my house in the middle of the night. Especially if I just told him I\u2019m busy! That would have gone double if I\u2019d still been living with my parents.

(literally the next day) to give the gift since you said you were busy and it was super late? So, he\u2019s impatient and a bad listener? Sounds charming. \n\n10-11PM for most people is pretty late to randomly just show up, especially if they don\u2019t live alone (especially with parents) and said they were busy. Idk what he was expecting here? \n\nGiven, he may be more upset at himself/ his plan for a romantic gesture flopping, but that still doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "YTA and owe him an apology", "NTA\n\nYou made it pretty clear that you were not available and it was late. He pushed that and it is perfectly reasonable not to want your boundaries violated.", "NTA. You have boundaries and he violated them.", "YTA, what cold? It's nearly July and it would have taken a couple minutes.", "NAH\n\nBut i have to ask this. Do you like your bf? Bc if you do, would it have killed you to put on some warm clothes and meet him right outside of your home for 10mins?\n\nYou make it sound like he wanted you to walk 2h naked in ice rain or something similar terrible. \n\nAs your bf i would be very irritated. If you couldn't come outside for at least another hour bc you have to help a disabled family member to get ready for bed or something, sure, no problem. But your reason was \"i just took a shower and don't want to be bothered with your surprise anyway\" - tbh, that would make me question the whole relationship. But even if i come to the conclusion i don't want to break up, i would definitly lessen the effort i put into the relationship bc obviously you take me for granted. \n\nBut honestly, I just can't understand why your bf isn't even worth it to you to make this very, VERY little effort to step outside for a few minutes. This is wild to me. And the only explanation i can come up with (for your behaviour and you feeling he invaded your space by showing up unnannounced w/o making a scene or even knocking, just standing there in the cold waiting to give you a birthday letter) is that you don't really like him. You may enjoy spending time with him, but only by your rules and on your terms, like he is some kind of toy you take out of the cupboard if you are in the mood but don't care about if you are not. \n\nBut anyway, like i stated, NAH, you can oc turn down your bf whenever and for whatever reason you want. But your bf is definitly not an AH here, not for showing up and behaving respectfully waiting outside nor for his reaction to you turning him down. I still hope you have a good 21. birthday.", "NTA. You do have a point. 11pm and in the shower? For a letter? Then get pissy about it? Life isn't a Rom Com trope.", "If you show up unannounced you will be ignored and later berated for invading privacy. \n\nNTA op", "NTA. You were pretty clear that you were busy and he didn\u2019t respect that. He could\u2019ve just left the gift without the pressure of you coming down if he really wanted to. It does sound like he was excited for your birthday and wanted to celebrate you, just didn\u2019t plan accordingly.", "YTA. You couldn\u2019t walk outside for 30 seconds to say hi and accept the gift?", "NTA. All the people sayings otherwise are thinking of themselves, not of you.", "NTA-I understand that he feels a bit hurt since he wanted to do something nice for you amd got shut down.\nBut i personally hate ppl showing up unnanounced aswell and youve told him beforehand you were busy.\nI think id just have a conversation that while you appreciate the thought you would prefer him announcing his visits as it makes you uncomfortable having people over unnanounced.", "NTA. These folks saying it\u2019s okay for people to just show up that late at night is wild to me. But I don\u2019t really like surprises and things unplanned is a huge stressor so maybe it\u2019s just me. If he wanted to come over he should have talked it out with you. It didn\u2019t need to be a huge surprise.", "NTA. Spontaneity and surprises can be fun. But not after you explicitly told him you were busy.", "NAH", "NTA\n\nYou already told him you were busy, it was late, you live with your folks and I don't care how long you've been together,  unless there is an honest to goodness emergency,  you don't show up unexpectedly at odd hours if that's not a previously approved thing. \n\nWhen I was your age, I probably would have prioritized being \"nice\" or \"polite\" and played along,  so I applaud your realizing so early that you don't need to do that.  I would have saved myself a lot of trouble if I had stopped being accomodating much sooner.\n\n  (Funny thing is that the very next man I met after I learned to be firmer about boundaries is the one I have been married to for more than 20 years.

Don't \"surprise\" me at 11 p.m.  There won't be anything romantic about my response.

Boyfriend starts wondering if she\u2019s not actually at home and maybe she\u2019s out with somebody else.

I don't know what your guy's dynamic is like, but I'm an introvert and after 21:00 my capacity for dealing with people is GONE. I wouldn't have let him in either.

It's not \"cute\" to send the photo of the gate - I literally just read a book where a serial killer/stalker did that.", "Wow you are ridiculous to say taking a picture of the gate is a serial killer move. He was trying to show her that he was outside and was expecting her to be suprised and happy bc you know it\u2019s her birthday and shes supposed to love this man?", "That sounds like boundaries of people new to a relationship. Not a year. More importantly why the hell would you even be in a relationship where seeing that person doesn\u2019t make you happy? Particularly given the context in this situation", "And she should\u2019ve been able to find the 5 fucking minutes for her bf on her bday. ESH", "She lives with her parents. It's pretty rude to show up unannounced at 11pm, especially since she already said she was busy.", "Um, he showed up unannounced at 11PM.", "Reddit moment lol", "I was initially going to comment a response to you actually, to thank you for spelling out the issues so clearly. <3  \n\nAgree completely, and I've sadly been down this rabbithole of ignoring/giving up my own set boundaries to please someone else, and it's never good.  \n\nThe people in the comments saying OP should have just given in and gone down/make him happy/not ruin his feelings are worrying. It's two people, their wants and needs both matter; I'd argue the person whose boundaries are violated calls the shots on what they need.", "yea it\u2019s not cute if it is from a stranger not your partner \ud83d\ude44", "Yea would be a little weird if they had just started dating but after a year...very weird.", "A relationship where you only date your bf bc you don't want to be alone and everybody else has someone. You don't really like the guy, but at least you can say \"i have a bf too\" (that you will replace oc when you meet someone you really like) and i get the impression that this poor guy ended up in such a relationship. What makes it extra sad is that the guy obviously really likes op. I'm so sorry for the dude :(  But i'm already old and hella confused about how young ppl treat their gfs/bfs. The only thing i'm surprised about here is that she didn't also called the cops on him."]}
