I (F19) am in college and finals week is rapidly approaching me. My college is a 3 hour drive to and from my home, so I only really commute home once or twice a month on a weekend. I was already home for the Easter holiday this month, so I thought that would be my one month visit before finals took over all my free time.\nMy sister (F17) just recently got out of a mental hospital after 6 months of being there for reasons I won\u2019t disclose.

Up until recently she assumed I was willing and going to do it. I firmly set a boundary for myself, saying I already had plans with a hometown friend for one weekend, and plans with the college friends for the other, and finals studying for the rest of the time.

Well, then your mom can babysit the daughter that SHE had, you are in no way, shape or form responsible for your 17(!) year old sister.", "NTA in any way. You are not her guardian. Keep standing up for yourself.", "NTA\n\nYou have your own duties and school 3 hours away. Your sister does not like you, does not respect you, and will not listen to you. \n\nTell you mom the best you will do is to do a 5 minute call once a day. She needs to find someone local or sister needs to go with her.", "NTA. Your mother shouldn't have made plans to go on holiday with her bf right after her 17 daughter got out of a mental hospital. She also shouldn't have assumed you'd travel back home every weekend that month to babysit a 17 year old, without ever bothering to mention it to you. This is completely on your mother not thinking things through.", "NTA. As a mother, I\u2019m shocked that your mom is at all comfortable going on weekend trips when her kid just got released from a 6-month stretch at a mental unit. I have one teen dealing with mental health issues not anywhere near as serious and I wouldn\u2019t leave them without a parent for ANY reason right now while they\u2019re vulnerable. That\u2019s just crazy to me. \n\nAnyway, I agree with you. You\u2019re not a parent or a social worker. This is not your responsibility. It would be one thing if your mom had asked and you agreed. But to just expect it from you is totally inappropriate.", "NTA because it's true you have your own life, stressors, responsibilities, etc. If you're right your sister doesn't even like you then idk what the point is. It probably is necessary your sister has some sort of supervision, sure. I wish the psych unit had coordinated some services for her, such as peer support or outreach support. Those types of workers could check on her and spend some time with her. Is there anyone else who can do wellness checks on her? \n\nAlso your sister is not an adult lol but I get what you're trying to say. She's still a kid, and a struggling one at that. I do think you should be a bit more sensitive to that as she may be at risk of harming herself.", "NTA, and it's not even the point.   \nYou can't babysit a adult grown as woman if they don't wanna be babysat. \n\nIf you sister had asked you, even if that ask would be \"*OP, I don't like you, you don't like me, but I'm terrified of being alone, can you please come just be here?*\" the situation would be different.   \nOf course your mother need's a break, but there is sitters for adults to be hired.   \n\n\nStand your ground.", "NTA. She can't expect you to drive a 6 hour round trip every weekend to babysit. Fuck that shit.", "NTA, not your kid, not your problem.", "ETA. There has to be a little more to the story if you're not willing to help your sister as she recovers, but your mom definitely should not have sprung this on you!

And OP's mom needs to start parenting.", "The thing is, she was released specifically because she\u2019s no longer at risk of self harm. But I agree, I wish the actual mental hospital set something up like that for her.

I think someone else would be more appropriate, such as a mental health worker like I listed before.

You know who shouldn't be 'in charge' of a 17yo who just got out of a mental hospital?  Someone that 17yo doesn't get along with and isn't on civil terms with!

That's what being a parent is, you do not get to do what you want all the time because you need to make sure your kids are safe. Make it clear to your mother that you are not your sisters' parent, she is, and that it is her job to make sure she is taken care of.", "Exactly, what are you supposed to do? Sit next to her all weekend? You are not a trained medical professional.\n\nNTA and congrats on standing up for yourself!"]}
