Your interfering MIL has conveniently forgotten that her precious son is the reason you arrived pregnant and unmarried.

Your child nor you deserve to suffer and condemned for a damn book, your MIL is quite hypocritical and she deserved to be called out for that.

That its all your fault.  Screw her. Definitely file for child support.", "NTA - MIL sounds like a nasty and controlling person to be around.

Don\u2019t say that as an idle threat. When it comes to divorce, do not say that out anger and then apologize later and stay. If you said it, it\u2019s because you mean it.\n\nSo now follow through.\n\nGet your belongings - anything you came into the marriage with only - and move back home with your mom and dad. Leave any clothing, jewelry, personal care items, anything your husband or his family bought for you stays there. Only take what is yours.\n\nContact a lawyer immediately. You are going to have a hard time with the rights of the child since they have money to throw around. Make it clear that you want full custody. Depending on where you live, that may be easier said than done. Find out whether you can cut ties with him and his family completely. I understand that means sacrificing any child support, but their negative influence on your future child is way more harmful than any amount of money you can collect will be helpful.\n\nBlock his number, his email, his social media, everything. He will want to talk. He will argue. He will want to get you back. He will want to shame you back. He will want to sweet talk you back. He will want to bully you back. He will want to demand you back. Do not give him the opportunity. Abusers do not like when the person they abuse leaves. His mom wants him? His mom can have him. He\u2019s a mommas boy? He can have her. Neither one needs you around to pick on and use as a whipping boy.\n\nLeave tomorrow if you can.\n\nIf you are truly done, and I hope you are because that is an abusive situation, then leave and be completely done.", "sweetie you need to move out and divorce this man. things will only get worse and your husband isnt going to stand up for you. can you really handle this for the enxt 18yrs? i dont think so, i wouldnt want to. you should find a way to escape before he lets his mother try and raise the baby and kick you out.", "NTA. Make sure your lawyer gets you compensation for the mental anguish imposed on you by that whole family in the divorce.", "NTA and absolutely divorce. I freaking hate those bible thumping idiots who act like it's always the woman's fault when a pregnancy happens as if her precious son wasn't RIGHT THERE PARTICIPATING. What, does she think that you were just thinking really hard about her son's dick and suddenly you were knocked up while he was giving food to homeless orphans or something? And if he's a spineless, useless waste of skin who won't say no to mommy, you do NOT want to be stuck raising a child with him.   \n\n\nYou should find those passages about how men who have sex out of wedlock were dealt with - I think it involved a lot of stones and being rendered infertile and a few other things. Women weren't the only ones punished.

Cheaper than divorce w the same results. Do it yourself. You CAN! you\u2019ve got the support of your mom and honestly that\u2019s all you need. I think you did great here.

You spoke the truth.  The ex's mother (we did end up close) and I used to have this debate all the time... she felt that as a woman being pregnant was 100% my fault.  Guys chased tail and it was up to the woman to turn them down/make sure she didn't get pregnant.  It was how the world worked.  I, of course, told her that I would take half the blame for being knocked up but that the other half lay squarely with her son.  \n\nPlease note:  This was a good natured debate, not a fight.", "NTA. If she finds it acceptable to talk to the family about the fact that you were pregnant while unmarried, then it should be equally acceptable that you point out her son\u2019s role in the pregnancy.\n\nHonestly, if your husband is siding with his mom against you, he\u2019s not being a good husband to you.

It's not healthy for anyone, and you shouldn't be this stressed when pregnant. There's so many issues here. First, your husband doesn't have your back, this is the deal breaker. Since you're already having a kid with him, how will the kid be raised? It seems like they won't allow you to raise the kid as you see fit. You are just the incubator. It will be MIL raising that baby the way she wants, and your husband will allow it he will never be on your side. \nSecond, your MIL tells you how you should dress and was against you going to school. She has no right to say this. Also, think of how she will treat your child if it were a girl.\nThirdly, they're super religious.

If you're going to move and separate/divorce, now is the time to do it. Please leave this situation. Trust me, as long as your husband still has his mums teat in his mouth, nothing will change and will only get worse. You will have no one to back you up in that family.

Get out and get some counseling to learn to make better choices.", "You go girl! Enough is enough!  I would sign up for a couples therapy and see if you and your husband can get on the same page because maybe he can see the light and you both can move forward in a happy marriage.
