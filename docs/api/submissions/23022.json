Nothing worse than these type of people", "NTA\n\nAt a certain point, the argument will never end until you try his way. You did what he wanted.\n\nThis is a symptom of a deeper issue though. If you are telling him you don't want to do something because it will cause destruction of your property, it's concerning to me he is ignoring this. He's not proving to you that his way works by doing it often without incident, he's not coming to you with Google searches on how you are incorrect, boiling water is excellent on your particular flooring. He just expects you to do as he says. It's problematic that the things he is suggesting to do are also in violation of bottom-level basic cleaning knowledge. He knows *very little* but is insisting that he lead.\n\nThis isn't about the superiority of knowledge, it's about criticizing you and your efforts.", "NTA if he\u2019s not happy with how they\u2019re done, he can do them.

That is probably how he deals with his stress from work because he is emotionally stunted.\n\nYou don't do it his way- he gets to be mad.\n\nYou do it his way and stuff is ruined?- he's still mad.\n\nThis is a toxic shit show, and if you stopped doing the chores because he's always mad, he would still be mad.\n\nThe only way out of this pattern is to leave the relationship. \n\nIt is not your job to absorb and process his stress.", "I hate telling people to leave their spouse but he's toxic as he!! Leave and find someone who let's you have a voice", "NTA.  He wants you to do things his way, he has to accept how they come out.  Him calling you a jerk is unfair.  You just did it his way.  He's lucky you only ruined a pan and did not pour boiling water on the floors.  He needs to take some responsibility here.", "NTA...Guy's a jerk. Stop cleaning anything and let \\*him\\* take up the responsibility. A week or 2 of that and I guarantee he won't be criticizing you any more!", "NTA you are not his servant and if there are some chores he likes to be done in a certain way, he should take over some of the responsibility.", "NTA - This is giving me 'Sleeping with the Enemy' vibes.", "NTA do you just make less money or do you work mess hours?

You maliciously complied with a request, knowing it would ruin the pan.", "ESH mostly him though\n\nWas fully on your side until you recorded yourself scratching up his favorite pan which I am assuming was entirely out of spite.

But only because you actually ruined the whole pan on purpose you could have just scratched it once to show him then at least it\u2019s still useable. \n\nWhy is your immediate reaction to just ruin his pan because he told you to do it the wrong way though lol reminds me of that saying if someone told you to jump off a cliff would you? I\u2019d say actually you know that would ruin the pan right and if he says no it won\u2019t, say well you do it that way then and see. Sounds like your husband doesn\u2019t actually know how to do chores properly and since you are the one doing them you should be dictating how they are done.", "Gently YTA. I get the frustration, that can be incredibly annoying to be told how to do something and be told wrongly\u2026. BUT, there are better ways to get that point across. Ask him to wash the pot in front of you instead of recording it. Make HIM do the damage to the floors using boiling water. Frame it as wanting to ensure you are on the same page, but let him \u201cshow you\u201d his better way. OR If he has specific tasks he insists should be done a specific way trade tasks so that those are his to do. My partner insists on a very specific way to fold her laundry, so when either of us does a load it\u2019s up to each person to fold their own. I have a extremely particular about my cast iron skillets so even if she cooks with one I will clean it so I know it\u2019s done right. Neither of us has a presence on most of the other chores so we just split those based on availability.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
