This is a learned behavior like any other. It is not inevitable that you will be angry or need to be angry AT someone- you can learn a different way of handling these feelings. The core to changing an emotion-based habit is accepting that you and only you are responsible- no one can do it for you and you need to not blame others for when you do it. Next, CBT workbooks and/or learning more about the process of habit formation will help. You should practice noticing when you feel the need to be angry. When does it happen? Under what circumstances? Apologize to others when you do this and in a way that takes accountability- that is an important reinforcement to noticing your behavior. If you can't realistically apologize to the person, make a point of apologizing in your head and then move on, it's still good practice. Next, you should try to identify why you feel the need to react this way. What is your anger protecting you from or what is its reward (i.e. does it make you feel good in some way to be angry? Why?) . In my experience, therapy is most helpful at this part- figuring out what the underlying hurt or issue. Sometimes just knowing what the 'why' behind your anger can help you let it go.  In either case, understanding why you feel that way can help you identify alternative ways to meet the underlying need. Try to practice this as a separate activity - for example, if the anger protects you from feeling shame, maybe there is a way to soothe those feelings through journalling or mindfulness meditation. Next, you need to come up with a few go to things to do when you feel triggered to be angry - like going to the bathroom for five minutes or taking a walk. Just something that will let you soothe your nervous system. Practice imaging the situation that makes you angry and then engaging in your alternative actions. It will help make it easier when the time comes. Finally,  practice! This is a habit and you won't be as good at it as quickly as you'd like, but the longer you try, the better you will get. If you have loved ones you trust with this part of you, you can tell them what you are trying to do. It's helpful to keep you accountable and they may have insights into your behavior that you may benefit from. But only share if you know they won't use it in a manipulative way.", "What are the circumstances?

My great-grandmother showed me once, and I don't know if this is typical, but... You heat the thing on the stove first. You slightly dampen the clothes and fold them into little balls so the moisture can spread through them. You fill a spray bottle of water 'cause you're gonna need it; there's no steam coming out of this iron so between wetting the clothing and the spray bottle that's how you make steam. You lay out the clothes, then get a sheet of fresh newspaper and lay that over the clothes, and then you iron with the paper in between, bc stove heating means you can't know how hot the thing is and it's likely to burn your clothes without the paper. You have to periodically spray the clothes with more water. The whole process is horrific, thank God for modern technology.
