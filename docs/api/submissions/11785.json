Last December, he had an appointment with a new pulmonologist, who ordered allergy testing to confirm or rule out allergies as a cause for his somewhat frequent wheezing. The doctor wanted the tests done that day, but due to scheduling issues she said we could wait, but to have it done before his next appointment in April. \n\nMy sons mother and I are divorced, though we are still going to court for issues related to custody. To say the least, we do not get along. We share custody 50/50. I have made several (4-5) attempts to take my son to get the testing done during the time he is with me, each time Ive let her know in advance. Each time shes said \u201cthat doesn\u2019t work for me, because XYZ, please don\u2019t take him without me\u201d. So I have postponed it each time in an effort to keep her involved. But she has not made a single effort to take him during the time he is with her. Not even mentioned it once. \n\nI informed her last night that Id be taking him today, and would let her know how it goes and send her any paperwork I got. Lo and behold, she said today doesn\u2019t work for her, and that she needs to be able to schedule a day off to go. Then stated she has the 27th of this month off work and  asked me to wait until then. I don\u2019t know what my schedule will be like in 3 days, let alone 3 weeks. I can take him today, and I\u2019m done trying to accommodate her schedule. \n\nAs a side note, last weekend I asked if I could pick our child up and take him to a car show (he loves cars) ,she said that he was taking a nap and they were going to the beach when he woke up. I said Id pick him up when he woke up, take him to the show, walk around for 30 minutes, then bring him to the beach, and be there shortly after they got there. After running out of excuses, she said that she was \u201cnot comfortable being near me\u201d even though I offered, solely as a courtesy, to stay in my vehicle the entire time. I\u2019ve not said or done anything that would make her fear for her safety. She uses \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable\u201d as an excuse when it\u2019s convenient for her. So, my initial response to her once again asking me to wait until she could attend was \u201cif you aren\u2019t comfortable being near me for a 30 second exchange so that our son could go to a car show, how are you comfortable being near me for an hour + for the testing?\u201d She continued on to say that because the hospital is a public place with security, she\u2019s fine with it. As if the beach with actual police officers isn\u2019t a public place. \n\nSorry if the side note was unnecessary. It doesn\u2019t make a difference to me if she\u2019s there or not. It\u2019s not about me, or her. It\u2019s about our son. I told her that, and told her if our son asked about her, I would tell him that she wanted to be there but had to work.

She even hired an attorney, presumably with the tax money, if that doesn\u2019t add insult to injury\u2026 \n\nWhile I understand why it\u2019s easy to say \u201cit takes two to tango\u201d, that\u2019s not always the case. I\u2019ve done all I can, and will continue to make efforts to maintain a cordial co-parenting relationship. But truthfully, coparenting will never be possible with someone like my ex. It has severely effected my own mental health and I wish there was a solution other than just having to deal with it and hope for the best.", "Why, you haven\u2019t given a reason", "The courts won't be happy with mom constantly postponing a necessary medical appointment.", "I have been strictly emailing for quite a while. Was using TalkingParents for a while too. Additionally, I\u2019ve got Our Family Wizard (got a fee waiver, so it was free) I won\u2019t answer calls or texts , and recently blocked her number because she constantly tries to overstep that boundary and I won\u2019t let her.", "After she said \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable\u201d, I\u2019d refuse to do any child custody exchanges at her house anymore. If the daycare is closed, make sure you\u2019re meeting in a public location. I had a coworker who had to meet his ex at a police station to do custody exchanges. It was the only way to ensure his safety after his ex pulled some craziness. \n\nI know you said you don\u2019t mind the extra driving time with your son, but her house is not a safe place for you in my option.\n\nEdit - spelling", "I'm so sorry she is treating your son like a pawn. He loses out while she's trying to punish you. I hope the appointment goes well and that you get some answers on allergies.", "Who's insurance will be paying for the tests? If it is you go ahead and make sure your son is taken care of medically. If she does have insurance, will it cost her too much for the tests?\n\nTake him for the tests and tell them to call you with the results.\n\nIf it were my kid, I would jump through hoops to make sure he got tests done asap!\n\nI grew up with severe stomach pains and everyone dropped the ball on me. I got diagnosed thirty years later with food intolerances! No more hair falling out, excruciating stomachpain that lasted for days and I now have a diet to follow.\n\nQuality of life is important, your ex should know this.", "This is where you have been a bit TA. You know she can't take time off without notice and you haven't been giving her notice or trying to coordinate in advance with her.\n\nI understand where you are coming from, but the court won't see this as a slam dunk like everyone else is saying. She says, \"your honor, I told Chance-Ad I wanted to be at the appointment and gave him dates I was available. He continued to schedule without advance notice.\"\n\nWhen you're the non-crazy parent, you have to work overtime to be generous to the crazy parent because the courts, in my experience, tend to love the crazy slacker parent.", "Unfortunately, I am self represented and have been for the duration of this ordeal. She\u2019s now retained an attorney, and I considered every aspect of this that I could possibly think of, and with the past efforts I\u2019ve made, her lack of efforts, and our current court order, I just can\u2019t fathom any way this could be turned against me.", "The medical thing is messed up. Take your kid to the doctor.\n\n\nBut your \"I don't know my schedule more than 3 days out?\" Are you constantly asking her 1 day in advance about the doctor? You know which days you are going to have the kid, and you should know availability for your kid during that time. It definitely sounds like you are intentionally trying to make it difficult for her....although she isn't making any effort. \n\n\nAt best, you're being willfully ignorant. Just being like \"this works for me, so it should work for everyone....a few hours notice is totally cool\".", "You can't ever make people like the above happy.. they think moms have all the rights.", "That right there will get her in big trouble.", "Exactly.", "I just realized I forgot to add an important part of that statement\u2026 She recently told me I am no longer allowed at her home. This was after I offered to bring our child to her home (her mothers) and she declined and instead waited at our exchange location for 30+ minutes, while rushing me because her other child\u2019s father was on his way to drop their daughter off\u2026 I said \u201cso (daughters father-BD#2) is allowed at your house, but I\u2019m not?\u201d To which she replied, \u201cyes because he coparents with me\u201d \n\nI ended up having to go to her house anyways because i accidentally left my sons antibiotics (he had strep) at home. She threatened to call the police on me if I showed up to drop his antibiotics off, and I had to text her mother (who was out of town) and get her written consent to drop his medicine off on her front porch. I emailed her and apologized for forgetting his medicine and offered to meet her at the gas station 2 minutes up the road from her house, and said if she didn\u2019t reply I would just drop it off on the porch. She never responded. When I got there, her and her boyfriend were making themselves comfortable on the couch. I could see through the giant glass door, wasn\u2019t snooping. I set the medicine down and left. Then got a message that said thanks for \u201cthrowing\u201d his medicine at the door. \n\nNot sure why I just wrote all of that. To be honest, it\u2019s rare that anyone ever pays attention to the little details of the situation long enough to understand what I am dealing with. So I guess I\u2019m just venting at this point.", "It can sadly. \n\nParents even argue about vaccines in court. I highly recommend retaining an attorney. It will serve you well now & in the future.", "This is true, but won't matter in the eyes of the court.", "Yup yup. Courts will want to know her excuse for constantly postponing it, and ask her why she believes she has to be there. They will likely not accept majority of excuses offered.", "Wow, this sounds so exhausting! Hang in there, I'm sure your kid is worth it!\n\nBut since it wouldn't do to depend on a Reddit post here and there to get things out in the open, maybe try to find some support groups for single parents/dads,  whether in person or online. I'm sure there's people out there who can be a support for you. Take care!", "I'm glad you have a place to vent! She sounds so frustrating and your feelings about it are valid", "Many don't understand  that just cause you gave birth doesn't give you more rights. I have 3* all grown* and I was a single mother but, if their dad had wanted to be a part of decisions  I would have agreed. However, I got to make them myself. My ex husband* not their dad* was the abusive ex and even he never tried to step into that part of my life. My kids were my kids. I fully support involved parents... but, trying to use the \"well, I carried them and gave birth so I'm more important\" crap doesn't work for me.", "Especially  since Dr. wanted it done ASAP and dad tried to accommodate  her. She's gonna be in a world of hurt if something  happens and it could have been prevented.", "Hell, I nearly got in trouble with court stuff once cause (thanks to my ADHD) I forgot to call in my son's medication refill and he went without it for just over a day. Luckily my kids dad stood up for me but the courts do not take this stuff lightly. Neglecting medical stuff is a big no no. She is going to end up losing a big chunk of custody if this keeps up.", "Yup! People just don't get it. Did you set up auto-refill after that?", "I wasn't able to cause his doctors office wouldn't allow it, but my kids dad works as a pharmacy tech and we just had the prescription sent to his pharmacy and he does it every month from work.", "That's awesome yall work together like that! Whatever is best for the child/children is what everyone should care the most about."]}
