Last December, he had an appointment with a new pulmonologist, who ordered allergy testing to confirm or rule out allergies as a cause for his somewhat frequent wheezing. The doctor wanted the tests done that day, but due to scheduling issues she said we could wait, but to have it done before his next appointment in April. \n\nMy sons mother and I are divorced, though we are still going to court for issues related to custody. To say the least, we do not get along. We share custody 50/50. I have made several (4-5) attempts to take my son to get the testing done during the time he is with me, each time Ive let her know in advance. Each time shes said \u201cthat doesn\u2019t work for me, because XYZ, please don\u2019t take him without me\u201d. So I have postponed it each time in an effort to keep her involved. But she has not made a single effort to take him during the time he is with her. Not even mentioned it once. \n\nI informed her last night that Id be taking him today, and would let her know how it goes and send her any paperwork I got. Lo and behold, she said today doesn\u2019t work for her, and that she needs to be able to schedule a day off to go. Then stated she has the 27th of this month off work and  asked me to wait until then. I don\u2019t know what my schedule will be like in 3 days, let alone 3 weeks. I can take him today, and I\u2019m done trying to accommodate her schedule. \n\nAs a side note, last weekend I asked if I could pick our child up and take him to a car show (he loves cars) ,she said that he was taking a nap and they were going to the beach when he woke up. I said Id pick him up when he woke up, take him to the show, walk around for 30 minutes, then bring him to the beach, and be there shortly after they got there. After running out of excuses, she said that she was \u201cnot comfortable being near me\u201d even though I offered, solely as a courtesy, to stay in my vehicle the entire time. I\u2019ve not said or done anything that would make her fear for her safety. She uses \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable\u201d as an excuse when it\u2019s convenient for her. So, my initial response to her once again asking me to wait until she could attend was \u201cif you aren\u2019t comfortable being near me for a 30 second exchange so that our son could go to a car show, how are you comfortable being near me for an hour + for the testing?\u201d She continued on to say that because the hospital is a public place with security, she\u2019s fine with it. As if the beach with actual police officers isn\u2019t a public place. \n\nSorry if the side note was unnecessary. It doesn\u2019t make a difference to me if she\u2019s there or not. It\u2019s not about me, or her. It\u2019s about our son. I told her that, and told her if our son asked about her, I would tell him that she wanted to be there but had to work.

She has a cat, dog or hamster and does not want the child to get allergy test that could reveal her pet to be worsening sons condition.", "NTA, and she\u2019s being a really atrocious parent every time she asks for important medical testing to be kicked weeks or months down the road because she feels the need to personally be there every time. I\u2019m glad your child has you.", "NTA. You made plenty of effort to accommodate. You\u2019re a parent. You have custody of your child for your time. You\u2019re perfectly within your right to take your child to the doctor during that time. You made the effort to inform her and accommodate\u2026she passed on it\u2026.several times. She even made the statement that she wasn\u2019t comfortable being around you\u2026so why the hell would she want to be in a doctors office with you? \n\nSeems like she\u2019s intentionally trying to sabotage.", "NTA.  Your ex wife is negatively impacting your son's health.  By her refusal to either work with  a schedule or bring your son to the allergist on her own, she is impacting your son's doctor's ability to accurately care for him. As for her not being comfortable, and making statements about public places, I would document document document that and give it to your lawyer if you have one.  Good luck", "\u201cThis doesn\u2019t work for me\u201d as an excuse? How is it working for him being denied medical care? \n\nThis sounds like some kind of weird passive-aggressive control play, no need to dance to that tune.\n\nNTA", "Attorney here.  Start saving for an attorney RIGHT NOW.  If her attorney files anything, you can't afford to not be represented.  If you can't afford it, look for family law clinics in the area or through law schools in your state.  There are so many red flags in your comments.  If anything is filed, you **have** to be represented.  Your child needs to keep his sane parent at 50/50.  And a self-represented person will rarely win against an attorney.  That is the sad truth.", "She doesn't sound scared she sounds like she's intentionally being difficult.", "She's not scared. She's just trying to make OP's life difficult and maybe use claims of false abuse and being fearful in court. Given his comments and everything, that's most likely her angle.", "Why is OP the AH for being a good parent for his child? This isn't poor planning. His ex just wants to screw with him and it could very well put the child at risk.", "As MY side note, when I was first separated, our 6yo had trouble with the transition between households.  What worked really well was to take him to the Community Center pool on Sunday afternoon, then drop him off at his mother's afterward. Pool closed at 5, so we would end up at her place at 5:20.\n\nDropoff time was 5:30, so my ex started doing her shopping on Sunday afternoons and would arrive home at 5:30 on the dot.  Being difficult in order to be difficult.", "Some people don't have schedules for a certain week until a day or two prior. He is perfectly right in saying he would not know his schedule that far in advance. And some people can't request a specific day off on that short notice. It will be denied most likely. It needs to be at least a month or two in advance.", "Yeah for real. I don\u2019t get why she\u2019s ok with putting off medical care for her child. Like you said sounds like a power play or something. Op doesn\u2019t need permission to take his child to the dr.", "Seriously, I wish my ex was as proactive taking our sons to the doctor as you are.  I'll have to make appointments for him if the kids need to see a doctor while he has custody.  You're doing everything right - and  if you have 50% legal and physical custody,  you do not have to schedule anything so mom can be present. Doing so is solely a courtesy, and shouldn't come at the expense of your child's well-being.\n\nJust tell her \"you're not comfortable\" putting off necessary medical testing. \n\nDefinitely NTA.", "Oh, I absolutely agree.  The child needs the appointment.  But I still say they both suck", "Especially because she could have scheduled it right away and requested the day off in advance. By not doing that, she is being negligent in this child\u2019s medical care.", "Get one of the parenting apps and use that for your communication", "Jumping onto the first comment from you I'm seeing in this thread to say that, while I understand that it's cathartic to share this stuff with strangers on the internet, your comments are unwise. I'm not a lawyer, but I know that sharing details like this on the internet could come back to bite you in a big way. Delete these comments and only communicate with her through a parenting app like Our Family Wizard.\n\nAnd retain a lawyer. The longer you represent yourself, the harder it's going to be for the lawyer you will inevitably need to hire eventually to undo this tangled mess.", "I did this thing for myself, but i don't reccomend you to do it. It's exhausting to work, take care of your son, study all the possibilities regarding her actions.\n\nI fought divorce, child custody, with temporary orders, plus 15+ criminal charges filled by him (not your legal system but almost the same). I work in it but i couldn't get an attorney because my ex was a \"vip\" in my legal system. So i bought myself law books, studied during nights, filled all the claims and counter-claims, defended myself against the criminal charges. I delt with officers breaking the evidence, after asking me if that's the only one, did i have copies... After a year of fighting this, i got into law school. I needed this because, like many other people, i had no idea about the laws. \n\nI did ended up winning all the cases, having all the charges dismissed, but it's a struggle. The law school helped me gain confidence, but if you can, get a lawyer also. \n\nYou know your case better than anyone. But not even you can anticipate all the legal ways that she can use to win her case. \n\nBtw: my ex got away with filling all those false charges, even if some were against the state & CPS. But he lost all the cases. And after 3+ years and a lot of stress and struggle. In this time, he saw our kid twice, but only because he wanted me to withdraw my cases. Never once looked more than 1 second or talked to our kid. Well, it's a long story but i think you should know you are not alone. \n\nAnd i always reccomend to everyone to get a lawyer.", "What efforts have you made to actually shedule more than 3 days in advance? She's apparently giving you dates to which you say: I don't know what i'll be doing then?", "Given the way she's acting, I would suggest audio recording your handoffs.  Start recording on your phone while you're still in your car then tuck it in your pocket with the mic end sticking out or just hold it in your hand \n\nIf you ever drop something off on the porch again, start video recording before you get out of the car and video yourself dropping it off.  If she brings up in court you \"throwing the medicine\" you'll be able to show the video of what you actually did.  Avoid videoing through her window though - just the outside of the house to capture your own actions.\n\nAs long as you're doing the recording in public places you're legally fine. But look up whether you're in a one party consent state.  If you are, then audio recording even in private is fine.  If you're in a two/all party consent state you'll need to tell her that you're recording.  \"Since you've said you're not comfortable in my presence I'm recording all our meetings to ensure everyone's safety.\"  \n\nNext time you have a meeting with your lawyer ask him about the best way to handle this, since local jurisdictions may have different preferences.", "She gave me one date, 20 days from now. And this is a first. To which I say: I\u2019m not waiting that long. Truthfully it doesn\u2019t matter what my schedule is like because I have and always will drop whatever I\u2019m doing to make sure my kids taken care of.", "Not trying to offend here, but this sudden shift in behavior makes me think there's a specific reason she doesn't want you to be there for it.  I'm not a doctor but quick googling is telling me that allergy testing and genetic testing are linked... is there any chance that your ex is trying to keep you in the dark about something?", "If she regularly sends messages that outright lie (throwing medication), document everything and take pictures.  She's saving all her messages.  Save yours too.", "She's screwing around to build a case against you. You need an attorney. Even attorneys themselves would rather be represented by other attorneys in court because it's too easy for them to get emotionally affected leading them to missing things and making mistakes."]}
