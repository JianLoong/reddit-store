A place where one of your main carers hates you and a dog with anxiety is constantly going nuts at your presence is not a healthy forever home for a cat, not to mention could become dangerous for the children. Even chill cats can become violent under long term stress, and it's so much harder to get them adopted once they've been taught an extreme aversion to kids or dogs. For some cats all it takes is one toddler tail pull to completely reverse their personality. Bringing the cat back to the shelter was a kindness for everyone but op. This WAS the most reasonable solution. Op was unreasonable for putting a living creature in that position like a bargaining chip.\n\nMeanwhile OP broke a promise they made when moving in together (spoken or unspoken), and is now throwing a hissy fit that he can't trample over those explicitly stated boundaries. Op can have that cat when so dumps him.", "I disagree specifically because she was very up front about this and communicated it clearly from the very start.

I have seen too many lovely cats become basically unadoptable after being subjected to that kind of stress. Any home does not equal good home.\n\nOp agreed to partner and have kids with this woman at the cost of not having cats in the future. He saddled her with kids and thought that was enough leverage to go against her wishes and bring a cat into their mess. Yes, that poor kitty being subjected to ops childish game. But your sympathy is misdirected if you want an animal to be put in that situation, where one of the carers hates it, a dog with anxiety (according to op) is constantly freaking out at its presence, and there's two young kids to top it off. It just takes one tail pull to completely change a cats personality, let alone the prolonged stress, and if you send an adult cat back to the shelter after it has learned to defend itself by scratching a child, you might as well be sending it for execution.", "They're supposed to be partners.

SO would need to organise training for the dog, assuming shes the primary caregiver to their kids, she'd have to spend time cat-proofing the house and watching the cat around the toddlers - either the stressed dog or stressed cat will likely attack one of the kids. An animal, much like a baby is a two yes only option.", "So why would you force the dog to have anxiety and the cat to have to deal with an anxious dog? How was this fair to the cat at all?", "YTA.\n\n>Oli had a huge overreaction and hid.\n\nThat's not an overreaction. That's the expected response from an animal with a *known* fear response. Why would you force this uncomfortable situation on a pet in your home? Do you not care about his needs being met too? That's like saying \"my SO's dog has a fear of loud noises, but I really like Heavy Metal music and miss my subwoofers. I figured he'd just get over it.\"\n\nJust because Oli's circumstance is inconvenient to you doesn't mean it'll magically go away if you do w/e you want anyway. \n\n>I was upset and asked her what she did with my cat.

You've even already admitted to knowing this was a selfish decision.\n\nThe silent treatment you're giving her is childish at best, a new pet in the home is a huge decision and requires a serious discussion with all parties affected by and responsible for new pet.\n\nAt the very least while Oli is a part of your home, You have to accept the fact that you can't have a cat.

I hadn't realized how important cats were in your life, or I would never have moved in with you, because it wasn't fair to either of us... we'll never both be happy in the same household.

It's not hers to get rid of, and it won't even help, since it's a sign of a deeper incompatibility.\n\nJust as they both started out thinking that, if OP just didn't get a cat after his old one died, it would all be okay, she is making the same mistake: she thinks if that one particular cat is removed from the household, everything will be okay and they'll again be living in the fantasy world they were trying to live in before OP brought the cat in the first place. But it won't. What they should have learned from OP bringing in that cat -- even though that wasn't the right way to learn it, and that part is OP's fault -- is that they're genuinely and deeply incompatible on the subject of pets, and they probably will never be able to live together without at least one of them being unbearably miserable. \n\nThey need to treat that as fact, and figure out what they're going to do about it... not ditch the evidence and return to pretending it isn't true.", "She moved in.

What did he expect?\n\nI love dogs and cats. My boyfriend loves dogs and cats. If I dated someone who hated pets that would be completely on me.

Flooding the dog by forcing the presence of the cat is also an awful way to begin training it to be comfortable around it. Forcing it over threshold will trigger fight, flight or freeze and remaining in that state for prolonged periods causes chronic stress which is not only bad for an animals mental state but also physical state. In all honesty he's lucky the dog was fearful rather than prey driven or it would have been far worse for the cat. \nDog, cat, child, bird, monkey, whatever.

He really badly wanted a cat, she said before it's a dealbreaker, so he waited for them to have kids, got a cat and he knows it's not as easy for her to just leave as before, when they didn't have children.

In other words, no cats is a condition for her. He knew shit upfront, moved her in and had kids with her then after this is all locked in he randomly brings a cat home without asking her. \n\nGetting the cat because he missed his old cat is irrelevant, he already knows she only moved in because he wouldn't have a cat for long and that she absolutely hates cats. Missing a cat and getting one is irrelevant to that and knowing how his twins mother would feel about it.\n\nas for being a relationship that is working out or not, again that has no relevance. If the relationship isn't working out and the sticking point is he'll leave someone he loves so he can have cats, then you leave them, move out and get a cat.

Pets are a two yes situation.\n\nI have to lean towards YTA for this guy, as she told him she didn\u2019t want a cat, he decided she did. She then told him the dog would react poorly to a cat, he is shocked when this is true. She then told him to get rid of the cat or she would, then he is shocked when this happens. Why does he believe her to be lying at every step? \n\nThey are a young couple with what must be very young twins, maybe focus on that instead of cat ownership?", "I mean the dog was before the relationship.

Don\u2019t give up a pet you already have owned for a while. That\u2019s f*cked up imo. Let the dog die naturally like his cat did.\n\nAlso I\u2019m still confused how the miscommunication happened when she moved in. She didn\u2019t move in with her dog until his cat died because she didn\u2019t want the dog around cats. So\u2026 what didn\u2019t click in OPs head? Did she not explicitly say she didn\u2019t want her dog around cats if she moved in? Did she need to be more explicit with him? Did he tell her he\u2019d be getting a cat again and not to bring the dog if that would be an issue?\n\nThis issue wouldn\u2019t have existed if they knew whether he\u2019d be getting another cat after his died before they all moved in together. This was easily preventable.\n\nBut we can\u2019t change the past. So what to do now? Well. They live together and have children. I think both partners being so adamant\u2014 one demanding no cats, one demanding to have a cat\u2014 is misplaced priorities.\n\nBut. I guess my opinion is. No cat. It stresses out the dog. And it stresses the mother. They are stuck in a position that affects the dog and their children (leaving over a pet seems\u2026 dumb to me).

Cats are going to be a no go the entirety of this relationship.\n\nETA - I forgot there were kids involved. But still this whole situation is indicative of incompatibility.

Condoms are about 95% effective with perfect use, but only 87% with typical use; bc pills are >99% effective with perfect use, 91% with typical use.

I\u2019m willing to bet if he got a fish or a bunny she would be fine with it.  However, she went out of her way at the beginning of their relationship to specifically say that cats are deal breakers for her. She moved in with him under the understanding there would be no cats.

Some people might think it's an overreaction, but pets are more of a lifestyle. They're more significant than any hobby, and you shouldn't give up hobbies to enter into a relationship (within reason) either!\n\nGiving up cats forever, for me, would be crushing. If I found out the person I was casually seeing hated cats, I would just laugh them out the door. What's the point...? You only get one life. But at the same time, they're not WRONG for not liking cats (*well,* actually... jk) and they're allowed their preferred lifestyle as well. OP probably just figured he could pull something like he did in the OP because he didn't take her seriously. \n\nThank god I ended up with someone who not just likes cats, but is willing to trap and tame feral kittens with me and deal with the heartbreak of giving them away. Total stark contrast to the way I grew up, with my mom loving animals but my dad always killing her joy and trying to keep her from adopting. Is breaking up with people who you are incompatible with from the beginning SO FUCKING HARD??", "I sure hope you don't have a partner with that type of mindset. That's his partner, the mother of his two children.

Don't let her move in under false pretenses then.", "Uh none of that extra stuff you added at the end there is necessary.", "I find it weird that OP exclusively refers to his partner as his SO, never his gf or wife. TBF, I grew up in a very Mormon community.

If giving up your dog for that amount of time isn't compromising then I don't know what is.", "That's not why. She said she would NEVER accept a cat, including after her current dog was no longer with them. \n\nI agree that OP shouldn't have brought it up in this *way*; that was foolish and unfair of him. But I won't go so far as to say he should have brought it up at the start... it sounds as if he didn't realize at the start how badly he would miss having a cat. When they decided it, remember, his old cat was still alive... it can be hard to reckon how you're going to feel when something that isn't true yet is true in the future. \n\nOP should have sat down, still catless, and told his partner that he was terribly unhappy without a cat and asked her whether there's any way to reconsider. If she said no, as she probably would have, he could then decide whether he needed cats in his life more than he needed to live with this particular partner and be full time with his children, or not. At that point, depending on what the answer is, he either pipes down and stops arguing for a cat at home (though it would probably be wise to do some brainstorming about how to stay involved with cats otherwise, such as volunteering at a shelter) or else tells his partner that he's realized they're not compatible as live-ins, and he's going to need to move out. They then need to work out a parenting plan that will be feasible for them both and as good as possible for their kids. \n\nThe problem was never that OP brought it up now rather than at the start. Sure, it would've been better if he knew at the start, but lots of times people don't know where their incompatibilities lie, ranging from \"I cannot wake up anywhere near the time of day you have to,\" to \"I have realized that I'm really a gender to which you're 100% not sexually attracted.\" The problem was HOW he brought it up now.", "I'm a cat person, my husband would be content to never have any pets. When we were dating it was absolutely one of the things we discussed and I told him I'd always want to have a cat. We have compromised over the years, through life circumstances I didn't have a cat when we had our oldest and I told him I wouldn't consider getting another cat until we knew for sure we were done having kids because I didn't want him to have to clean up the litter box when I was pregnant. Our kids ended up being 5yrs apart. I waited until our youngest was 3, in part because I also wanted to make sure we were ready as a family. We got our current cat 2yrs ago. He's fine with her as long as she doesn't try to sit on him, she usually doesn't because there are 3 other people who are perfectly happy to have her in our laps. I don't ask him to do anything in terms of her care, but he accepts her presence because he knows that myself and the kids all love having a cat. And she's a really chill cat, so that helps!\n\nBut it was absolutely something discussed early in our relationship.", "I\u2019m a young childless weirdo who intends to continue on that path. I love animals. I could never date someone who wouldn\u2019t have pets, especially cats.", "She seemed quite clear the entire time. No to cat. Dog won\u2019t react well to cat. Will get rid of cat if you don\u2019t. He chose not to believe any of these statements. He seems to think she is just lying about this subject the whole time and makes unilateral choices. He definitely doesn\u2019t know how to communicate, she seems on top of her shit.", "Maybe because they are not married? And you will never see me calling my SO my boyfriend either. And you know what is the only thing this tells you? That I hate the English words girlfriend/boyfriend, it is not what we refer to to our partners we're not married to in my language, and it just feels weird for me, a 47 years old woman, to refer to my partner as a boy. I don't fuck boys, only men.\n\nI mean OP is am AH, the bigger one of the two for all reasons mentioned in other comments like that he knew she only moved in because the cat was old and an existing pet comes for a potential one. And I myself have both and love both but I would never get together with one who doesn't like them. That's what Op should have chosen. His partner was clear in her conditions and he agreed to them. He should have said he isn't and she would have stayed away. \n\nThe thing is only now analysing his choice of words of SO instead of girlfriend is a typical Reddit moment of ridiculous reach.", "Lol another redditor who doesn't know what hyperbole is, how shocking. \n\nPretty convenient how it usually only happens when it suits your arguments tho.", "That's not true, and it only takes a few seconds to Google it if you're not someone who works with animals like I have.

That\u2019s 100% effective.", "What red flag? Not liking cats doesn't make you a bad person.

They already have two children together and are fairly young - it's unlikely they have the means to afford a house big enough to split between pets and have already moved in together under the conditions they both initially agreed to, so waiting isn't an option.", "Yeah, he shouldn\u2019t even have introduced them on the first day. Experts say to keep animals apart from new pets and GRADUALLY get them used to each other on a week by week basis. OP was an asshole to the cat he claims to care so much for.", "\ud83c\udfaf", "It\u2019s really not that well described in the post tbh. \n\nNonetheless why WOULD she want to put in the effort required to socialize her dog to tolerate cats when she hates cats anyway? And that\u2019s fine. She was very clear about that.", "I wouldn't either, but that's what OP chose to do.  He thought he could harass and bully and guilt her into accepting a cat.  He was wrong."]}
