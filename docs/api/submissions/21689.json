A place where one of your main carers hates you and a dog with anxiety is constantly going nuts at your presence is not a healthy forever home for a cat, not to mention could become dangerous for the children. Even chill cats can become violent under long term stress, and it's so much harder to get them adopted once they've been taught an extreme aversion to kids or dogs. For some cats all it takes is one toddler tail pull to completely reverse their personality. Bringing the cat back to the shelter was a kindness for everyone but op. This WAS the most reasonable solution. Op was unreasonable for putting a living creature in that position like a bargaining chip.\n\nMeanwhile OP broke a promise they made when moving in together (spoken or unspoken), and is now throwing a hissy fit that he can't trample over those explicitly stated boundaries. Op can have that cat when so dumps him.", "I disagree specifically because she was very up front about this and communicated it clearly from the very start.

I have seen too many lovely cats become basically unadoptable after being subjected to that kind of stress. Any home does not equal good home.\n\nOp agreed to partner and have kids with this woman at the cost of not having cats in the future. He saddled her with kids and thought that was enough leverage to go against her wishes and bring a cat into their mess. Yes, that poor kitty being subjected to ops childish game. But your sympathy is misdirected if you want an animal to be put in that situation, where one of the carers hates it, a dog with anxiety (according to op) is constantly freaking out at its presence, and there's two young kids to top it off. It just takes one tail pull to completely change a cats personality, let alone the prolonged stress, and if you send an adult cat back to the shelter after it has learned to defend itself by scratching a child, you might as well be sending it for execution.", "They're supposed to be partners.

SO would need to organise training for the dog, assuming shes the primary caregiver to their kids, she'd have to spend time cat-proofing the house and watching the cat around the toddlers - either the stressed dog or stressed cat will likely attack one of the kids.

How was this fair to the cat at all?", "YTA.\n\n>Oli had a huge overreaction and hid.\n\nThat's not an overreaction. That's the expected response from an animal with a *known* fear response. Why would you force this uncomfortable situation on a pet in your home? Do you not care about his needs being met too? That's like saying \"my SO's dog has a fear of loud noises, but I really like Heavy Metal music and miss my subwoofers. I figured he'd just get over it.\"\n\nJust because Oli's circumstance is inconvenient to you doesn't mean it'll magically go away if you do w/e you want anyway. \n\n>I was upset and asked her what she did with my cat.

Her opinion of cats is suspect at best, but it doesn't change the fact that you already knew she didn't like cats, didn't want one, and that you would be forcing the situation. You've even already admitted to knowing this was a selfish decision.\n\nThe silent treatment you're giving her is childish at best, a new pet in the home is a huge decision and requires a serious discussion with all parties affected by and responsible for new pet.\n\nAt the very least while Oli is a part of your home, You have to accept the fact that you can't have a cat. Look at different pet options, or let it go.\n\nI hope you two are better at discussing parenting decisions, for the sake of your kids.\n\nedit: formatting", "Ok. I still think they should break up instead of raising their kids in this toxic household.", "I agree with the bringing the cat home without talking to her was AH move. However the part of the house being Oli's only is a very ah reaction too", "He chose to hook up with someone who hates cats. He is the one that broke the verbal contract, not her.", "No, she literally has the right to hate cats and refuse to have one in her house. Especially if they make her dog upset. She was upfront about this when they began dating. OP should have broken up then. She expressed her boundaries and he decided to stay with her and disregard them.", "His S/O needs to grow up too. Says just as much about her if she\u2019s unwilling to compromise in any way and she just flat out gets rid of something the second she doesn\u2019t like it.", "But it\u2019s not fair. Why should she get the only day in what animals are in the house? Because you can guarantee she wouldn\u2019t allow him a cat even if her dog passed.", "They have children together. It\u2019s already more serious. Compromise without communication isn\u2019t a compromise. Dude just brought home a cat.", "However, it's not fair at all for her to have pets and say no to OP, also she only got together with OP bc his cat was dying, really tells you about some ppl.\n\nESH", "Fair question and I'd love to see his response. Wondering if they got pregnant super quick. Not that it's a good reason.", "Also I feel like the kind of guy to do this isn't the kind to communicate well or divide responsibilities equally.", "Getting rid of an established pet that OP never said he had a problem with other than \"it's not fair!!!111\u201d is not a compromise. The dog is her family and deserves happiness too. If never having a cat was going to be a deal breaker, it sounds like she never would have moved in or been with him. OP, YTA.", "Ooooor... maybe they could be a pair of grown-ups and try some couple's counselling. Arguing like this over effing pets and risking their relationship over it is beyond pathetic and immature.", "You've misquoted - specifically per OP \"this home was Oli\u2019s home not whatever cat I bring in\" aka they are both aware the family dog is uncomfortable around cats yet he deliberately and knowingly brought in cat thereby making multiple existing family members (OP's partner and the family dog) extremely uncomfortable.\n\nWhen bringing new family members into the home it needs to be done in a way that doesn't harm the existing family members residing there.", "You are white knighting for an abusive guy to get a cat. Cats aren\u2019t objects, they belong in a home where someone did not get one impulsively out of spite over things he openly agreed to years before.", "He knew a cat would be a dealbreaker for her and the cat was gone when the dog moved in thats why he moved in", "He doesn't have the right to have a cat and also a partner who hates cats. Poor kitty is better off finding a good home than with OP who will make it live with someone who hates it. OP is not a friend to cats here.", "Wierd crazy cat lady perspective\ud83d\ude05", "He doesn't have that right if he lives with someone who is not, well, ailurophile, just because he loves cats. It's a joint decision at that point because they live together. He doesn't live alone.", ">I had a cat when we started dating\n\nShe chose to hook up with someone who *owned* a cat even though it's apparently something she's willing to take nuclear action over. \n\nESH.", "Does she literally have the right? You assumed they\u2019re married, but OP refers to her as his SO, not his wife. If they\u2019re not legally married or in a partnership, then she stole her roommate\u2019s cat.\n\nRegardless, he literally has the right to love cats and have one in his house, even if she did have the right to remove it. They both also have the right to take a shit on the kitchen floor and refuse to clean it up, but having the right to do something doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not an asshole for doing it", "~Having the right~ doesn't actually equate to not being an asshole. It's an asshole move to not even discuss things with your partner (and this goes both ways, which is why ESH).", "So, she\u2019s allowed to have a pet she loves to death, but he\u2019s not? This is what gets me. She\u2019s being very selfish in this case. It seems it\u2019s her way or the high way. If she truly loved him, she\u2019d find a compromise on the cat issue. She very clearly values the dog more than him (which is her prerogative) but she\u2019s still denying him something that brings him joy. Nowhere did he say he expected her to help care for it.", "He should not have brought it home to begin with. Pets are two yeses and one no for a marriage or partnership, and breaking that rule of thumb can lead to significant stress.\n\nI love cats, but my husband bringing one home caused significant distress in our home because we had already agreed no more cats until our oldest current cat passes. She is stressed out by other cats and she\u2019s elderly. But he made it clear he intended to keep the cat, which resulted in lots of literal catfights and some injuries to our cats. Now our eldest cat lives separated from the rest of the house and it\u2019s not fair to her at all, but she\u2019s the one who has anxiety.\n\nI was mad for AWHILE and he knew he should not have brought her home but he did and expected me just to deal with it. I did\u2026 but also it strained our relationship for a time and I feel like he regrets it.", "She didn't bring her dog in until his cat died, and he straight up said that she would not have stayed with him if he owned a young cat. She established her boundaries early in the relationship. He knew that the cat issue is a deal breaker, so he probably thought that he can sneak a new cat in and she would have to just put up with it since she's in too deep in the relationship. Low key manipulative.", "Getting a pet is a two yes, one no situation.\n\nOP agreed to the dog moving in years ago.\n\nThen he threw a childish fit about \"fairness\" and brought an unwanted animal into a home with four people and a dog.\n\nMy only hope is that this story is fake, as any decent shelter does home visits and won't let you impulse adopt like this.", "you\u2019re likely right.", "Yeah I don\u2019t see that happening given OP\u2019s maturity level here", "And I agree with you in that he should have told her he was getting a cat and just not force it to her. However OP is in his right to want another pet", "Only because she knew that the cat was on its way out was she okay living with a cat - but she *also refused to bring her dog* while the cat was alive. She\u2019s been crystal clear about her feelings - she would not live with a cat.", "Significant other is a relationship and they have kids together.", "Shelters don\u2019t do home visits. They ain\u2019t got the resources or time for that. Rescues sometimes do home visits, but since Covid have mostly moved to a FaceTime review of said space. At least in my state and the rescues out of state that I looked at last year.", "My biggest issue is not the fact that she\u2019s still a selfish person. Which is why I think she sucks. He obviously sucks for going behind her back. But that whole thing is completely one sided. And they really should end it somehow or neither have a pet.", "Both are immature af", "Wanting a pet: yes everyone is entitled to want things\n\nGetting a pet in this circumstance: unfair to SO, family dog, and the cat he selected for his doomed experiment.", "He cares more about getting a new cat than he cares about the feelings of his partner, children, and the dog that already lives there. OP was an asshole to bring a cat into an environment with someone who hates cats. It was cruel to the cat and yet here you are defending it. Be a better white knight for cats.", "We didn\u2019t have a home visit for our one dog.", "SO should be willing to accommodate OP wishes as OP did with her dog. It is a 2 way street. Her dog will eventually get used to the cat", "What do you bet he's got two babies he doesn't do anything for and is leaving out the fact that she can't handle more right now? I want the wife's side so bad. This reeks of \"only telling what makes me look good.\"", "Well she started the relationship under false pretenses so off to the dog pound with her.", "No, as I stated in another reply the wife is more worried about the dog's happiness than his. It's all downhill from there. Let her go be with the dog at the pound.", "\"Two way street\" only applies in certain circumstances\n\nOne-party no also applies in many circumstances\n\n\\- sex  \n\\- parenting  \n\\- housing  \n\\- people/animals entitled to live in the family home  \n\\- etc", "You can go get her story at the dog pound.", "What false pretenses? She never lied about not wanting a cat.", "That\u2019s a bit messed up especially as he chose to be with her knowing:\n\n1 - she didn\u2019t like cats and her dog couldn\u2019t be around cats\n\n2 - let her and the dog move in with him after his elder cat had died \n\nI think that he should have thought things through if he is dead set on having a cat, so no one would get hurt but now he also needs to think about the children he has had with his partner because this also effects them most importantly.", "It does not really. It's a 2 way street it just depends if both people in the relationship are willing to cross either direction. How is parenting a one party thing?", "The relationship began under false pretenses. If she had been honest about her plan of actions then he wouldn't have been baby trapped.", "For example the child going away to an over night camp - both parties have to agree to it, if on parent says no its a no. Same as traveling outside the province/state and especially country. If one parent says no its a no.", "He knew she didnt like cats at all before they had children, tell me how she\u2019s baby trapped him???"]}
