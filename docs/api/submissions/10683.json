I have 3 step kids (25f, 23m, 20f) but our relationship is more like friends. We get along well usually.\n\nI recently got the news an old friend of mine passed away, and I attended the funeral last week. \n\n20f got into an accident that day and was taken to hospital. I was just arriving at the funeral when my wife called saying I need to come immediately. I asked her if it was serious and what happened, but my wife said it was some cuts and bruises and a fractured arm. It wasn't anything life threatening. My wife was already at the hospital and so was 25f, so 20f had support.\n\nI said I was at the funeral and I'd come to hospital soon. My wife hung up so I quickly paid my respects, wanted to talk to my friend's family but didn't get a chance to because I was in a rush. I then went to the hospital.\n\nMy step daughter is thankfully okay and nothing that serious. My wife (and other step daughter), however, are furious because I didn't come earlier. \n\nI said I needed to go to the funeral and she said it wasn't anything life threatening, and I came as soon as I could.

You were already at a funeral (which is important in itself, it isn't just hanging out with buddies), paid your respects as quickly as you could and made your way to the hospital. You did absolutely the right thing.\n\nThe bigger question here is that why the hell is OP's wife married to a man young enough to be her son? If I'm doing the math correctly OP was 20 and the wife was 3-freaking-9 when they started dating. Grooming isn't just older man-younger woman, it works both ways.\n\nAnd now she's trying to make OP think he's the one being unreasonable.\n\nIt's interesting none of the comments (that I've seen so far) are pointing this out but if the sexes were reversed, the age gap is the first thing everyone would jump on. Grooming works both ways. So many people would be calling the man a creep if the situation was reversed.\n\nEdit: changed genders to sexes", "NTA. You checked on the urgency, evaluated the situation respectfully, kept it quick at the funeral, and made it to the hospital as fast as you could. You did the best thing given the circumstances.", "NTA. The seriousness was known. You did the right thing going to friend\u2019s funeral. This isn\u2019t even a close call. You\u2019d be the asshole if you skipped out on friends funeral.", "You're NTA. It was not a life threatening situation. Your wife is actually a bit if an A-H for calling you when she knew you were at a funeral. Her overreaction checks another A-H box. You won't get another chance to pay your respects, and your wife is acting as though you were at a tailgating party and refused to leave.", "NTA. The injury wasn\u2019t serious and the funeral was. Wife and SD are grossly overreacting", "NTA\n\nYou got the important info: stepdaughter was ok, injuries weren\u2019t life threatening.\n\nYou were already arriving at the funeral when notified of the accident.  \nYou got in and out of the funeral quickly.", "NTA you were at a funeral, not drinking with your buddies. Once you realized your step daughter was OK, it was fair to stay for the funeral.  Your wife may have been scared and overreacting, but she was definitely overreacting.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't choose \"some friend\" over being there to support your family. You were at a funeral, saying your final goodbye to a long-term friend of yours. You also made sure that your step-daughter was okay, and rushed in order to get to her as soon as possible.\n\nFor many people, attending funerals are a very important part of the grief process, as they help provide some form of closure. This was something you needed to do. It wasn't like you disregarded your wife and step-daughter, you informed her that you'd be there as soon as you could, and you held that promise.\n\nIf anything, your wife is TA here, because instead of accepting that both of your needs could have been met, she's upset that you didn't disregard your needs and prioritize hers.", "NTA\nFFS you were at a funeral. They are being entirely unreasonable and dramatic.", "No bro, you are not the asshole.", "NTA, but what the fudge? Did I read the ages wrong? When you started dating she was literally twice your age. Of course you and her kids are friends, you\u2019re closer to their age than hers. That is so creepy.", "NTA but tbh, differences in priorities are gonna come up with this kind of age gap. She's been dealing with things like raising children, paying rent and taxes and shit since you were 5 years old.", "NTA\n\nYou handled that perfectly!", "NTA. You were at a FUNERAL for Christ\u2019s sake.\n\nAm I the only one that thinks the age gap here is concerning? A woman old enough to be your mother, at 39 years old, started dating a 20 year old\u2026?", "Some of these AITA posts are starting to get less and less believable. If you\u2019ve been together for 10 years, that means your wife started dating you when she was 39, you were 20, and her oldest child was 15. It feels like a kid writing a fictional story, but forgetting to account for the highly unusual age differentials. \n\nBut if this is true, NTA.", "NTA! You and your wife got together when she was 39 and you were 20? She's groomed you dude...", "NTA.  Your wife is unreasonable.", "Ignoring the ages and sexes, I'm inclined to say there's some mighty unhealthy codependency and coping skills going on, and an unsustainable stress intolerance from your spouse and at least 1 of her kids. \n\nNot ignoring the ages, the aforementioned is HELLA compounded. \n\nNot ignoring the ages and flipping the sexes, ooooo boy if a man was dating someone 5 years older than his minor daughter and was this controlling and demanding? \n\nNTA, but OP, are you OK? No disrespect, but look through all the lenses to get a better picture of the situation you're in.", "NTA. Tell your mom\u2026 I mean uh wife\u2026 to chill\u2026.", "NTA, if it had been a very serious injury I imagine you\u2019d have gone straight away. I also imagine had it been anything other than a funeral you\u2019d also have gone straight away as well.\n\nIt seemed it was a really sad coincidence that something happened while you were attending a funeral but given the context of those injuries? I think a funeral would have taken priority, even if you had stayed for the whole service and spoke to your friends as you intended to.\n\nI can understand why your family is upset though, stress and pain do that to people but I think if you were to sit them both down and explain your thinking when things are a bit more calm? You should be able to smooth things over", "NTA\n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong. You were at a funeral. If anyone has an issue with you not being able to be 2 places at one time... that\u2019s on them.", "NTA. Your stepdaughter\u2019s injuries were minor and she had her mom and a sibling there already. Quickly paying your respects at the funeral and then going to the hospital was a reasonable decision.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n But wow, is she dramatic. Have fun with that.", "NTA. Did she expect you to ditch in the middle of a funeral and fucking teleport?", "NTA  The world doesn't revolve around your wife, and she just found that out. Your stepdaughter's injury was not life-threatening, and she will recover. But your friend will only have one funeral.", "Does she always overreact? Because that is an overdramatic response to the situation. This could possibly be due to the stress of the situation and, hopefully, she\u2019ll realize it later. \n\nAlso, you said this was an old friend. That alone should tell her the the funeral was a priority for you. (Doesn\u2019t even matter if you guys were not currently close). \n\nA minor accident does not take precedence over a death. (Unless we\u2019re talking about someone elderly, a child, or someone with serious health issues).", "NTA \n\n20f was not serious. Your wife told you she was in safe hands and had support. You couldn\u2019t just walk out of a funeral. 20f needs peace and rest and sleep not 26 people rushing into the room anyway.", "NTA - you assessed the situation fairly. Her injuries weren\u2019t critical. Even if you weren\u2019t at a funeral she had support at the hospital. The entire family doesn\u2019t need to be waiting around the ER.", "NAH,  you had other obligations to your friend, and your  wife and step-daughter were reacting  out of a trauma . it\u2018s a sucky situation. NAH", "NTA and why on earth are you with a 49 year old with kids your age?", "NTA. You were at a funeral. It is not like you stopped for junior mints on the way to the hospital.", "NTA I would dream of making my wife rush from a funeral like that, period. Even if it wasn't a super close friend. That's an important part of healing and accepting the death for everyone there. And especially not for some cuts and bruises. \n\nYour daughter was perfectly fine, other than maybe being a little shaken up. Plus she's 20 not 12. I really hope for your sake your wife was just stressed from the situation, and this isn't normal behavior.", "NTA. Your age gap is pretty concerning. You are barely older than her children. Your step daughter was okay. I'm sorry about the loss of your friend.", "NTA, she broke her arm and had some scrapes. That hardly qualifies as 'you MUST get here' even if you weren't at a funeral at the time!\n\nYour wife is acting like a child!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're being groomed and then blamed when the 20f wasn't even mad at you. Seriously, the one who's injured isn't even upset.", "This is tricky. I think both are important, but who will need you the most, your dead friend or your daughter in law and wife? YTA but not really .. it\u2019s a tough call because your grief matters ..

Wtf.", "Yeah that jumped out at me too. Plus where he says he has a \"friends\" relationship with his stepkids.  No shit, that's because they're his peers.", "I'm surprised I had to scroll this far to see something about the age gap. I just turned 39 and cannot imagine having anything in common with a 20 year old, who is likely a college sophomore.", "It took me a minute to put that together 30 & 49 seems a bit weird but acceptable to me. My brain didn't connect the 10 year together part. 20 & 40 is 100% weird and very icky.\n\nI don't like assuming to much, but that age gap is pretty fucky. Definitely possible that OP has been groomed to think and accept wife's messed up behavior is normal. I felt sorry for OP before it clicked, but now I just don't know. I hope it's not the case, but getting married might have been a bad idea.", "The oldest stop daughter is five years from him. The wife is 19?\n\nIs she rich?", "as soon as i saw their age gap i cringed. when i read together for TEN YEARS??? absolutely not. then the kids' ages??? wanted to vomit. then she's saying \"some friend\" as if it wasn't a funeral??? like ma'am. you are a predator and are trying to isolate him. i hope op gets out of this marriage asap.", "My eyes bugged out at that as well.", "I had a hard time getting past the first paragraph. His \"step kids\" are only a couple years younger than him. He likely was in elementary school with them.", "Only thing I was thinking! It's sexes, not genders tho", "I hadn\u2019t read anything yet, but my first thought was wondering if people would have the same reaction to the fact that he was apparently 20 and she 39 that they have if the sexed were reversed.lol", "I feel like this was secretly written by Aaron Taylor Johnson.", "That was my first thought too but I didn\u2019t want to be the first to say it.", "Who had a 10 year old he became a step parent to\u2026as well a 15 year old at the same time? What in the fresh hell is this?!", "I thought that too, reverse the sexes and there would be so many people shouting \"grooming\"!", "With a 5 year old!", ">it\u2019s not like he\u2019s in a rush\n\nGeez your technically not wrong but sheesh that is cold to say. Any who OP asked how bad it was. Bruises, small cuts and a fracture are no where near life threatening. The step daughter also has her mom and a sister there if i read correctly so she wasn't alone in a hospital.\n\nHe already rushed his time at the funeral where he could of talked to his friends family and shared memories with those close to the friend. Which helps the grieving process. Funerals are not for the dead they are for the living that cared about those whoa re now gone.\n\nBesides why did he have to rush. Where was wife or anyone to be there for OP? They already knew he was going to have a rough day given theres a funeral.", "Exactly! I\u2019m 40 and the idea of dating a 20 year old is so disgusting.

I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on here, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not a healthy dynamic.", "You don't need to reverse the genders because almost all the comments are already rightly pointing it out.", "I have kids. When there\u2019s health stuff I need my husband. A car accident is scary when your kids are involved. I think most parents would agree.", "Exhausting how people will read a post while it's in the \"new\" cesspool and complain that it doesn't have the same consensus as posts with 100+ comments. 99% of the time y'all just need to wait a few hours fr.", "He\u2019s not the parent though. He\u2019s the extremely close in age \u201cfriend\u201d. He was already AT the funeral he was notified anyway.", "We don't know what kind of accident it was. It could be a car accident. Could of been a skate board accident. Could of just been a tumble down the stairs.\n\nI understand if there was confirmed news of something serious. If even a bone was more broken beyond a fracture. Yet again who knows everyone deals with stress completely differently.\n\nI just don;t expect people to try and pull someone from something deeply emotional as a funeral for not much. It shows a rather bit of selfishness. Then try to guilt them cause they were in the middle of something pretty important."]}
