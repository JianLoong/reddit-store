My wife hung up so I quickly paid my respects, wanted to talk to my friend's family but didn't get a chance to because I was in a rush.

You did absolutely the right thing.\n\nThe bigger question here is that why the hell is OP's wife married to a man young enough to be her son? If I'm doing the math correctly OP was 20 and the wife was 3-freaking-9 when they started dating. Grooming isn't just older man-younger woman, it works both ways.\n\nAnd now she's trying to make OP think he's the one being unreasonable.\n\nIt's interesting none of the comments (that I've seen so far) are pointing this out but if the sexes were reversed, the age gap is the first thing everyone would jump on.
