My wife hung up so I quickly paid my respects, wanted to talk to my friend's family but didn't get a chance to because I was in a rush.

You did absolutely the right thing.\n\nThe bigger question here is that why the hell is OP's wife married to a man young enough to be her son? If I'm doing the math correctly OP was 20 and the wife was 3-freaking-9 when they started dating. Grooming isn't just older man-younger woman, it works both ways.\n\nAnd now she's trying to make OP think he's the one being unreasonable.\n\nIt's interesting none of the comments (that I've seen so far) are pointing this out but if the sexes were reversed, the age gap is the first thing everyone would jump on.

That alone should tell her the the funeral was a priority for you. (Doesn\u2019t even matter if you guys were not currently close). \n\nA minor accident does not take precedence over a death.

Your wife's lack of empathy for someone dying, is appalling.", "NTA\n\nShe is literally treating you like you're one of her children. You didn't do as you were told so now she's furious. If it was life threatening, you would have 100% have been there.", "Aside from the ahlge gap... which has nothing to do with this story.... I understand it being scary... but it was not immediately life threatening...why was the wife acting like the daughter was literally dying.... NTA... wife was being a bit dramatic.", "NTA, I get panic tends to take over, and not everyone thinks things through properly..... but your wife is kind of being unreasonable here. \"You chose your DECEASED friends' funeral over the health of your stepdaughter who was not in a life-threatening situation. \"", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA", "I noticed the age gap immediately, but wasn't sure how to comment on it because it didn't seem related to the problem. It IS creepy though, this guy was 20 when a 39-year-old was interested in him. She's old enough to be his mother.", "Well, I just saw this post and the ages were the first thing I noticed.", "I dunno. Depends on how hot she is!", "Info: was Op fucking groomed?

He was then in his fifties\u2026 They were dating \u201dofficially\u201d the minute she turned 18 (if not before). She soon moved to his country and got married at 19.", "The father of one of my male friends married a woman who was not only one year younger than my friend but also went to his high school and was in one grade below him. When he was in high school, his dad kept saying he should date this woman. He never did, but it was a very weird situation when the dad later married her. The father was very rich and when he later lost his money due to bad investments, the young wife immediately left him. \n\nSo OP\u2019s story could be true. If so, NTA", "Well, if you marry someone who has kids they become your step-kids.

Which makes sense, he's the same age as them.", "All of the top comments (and a large number of the other comments) have pointed out the age-gap and are rightfully calling it out as creepy, it\u2019s hardly something people are ignoring, not even a little bit.", "Bot", "Female (F) and Male (M) are sexes.

Okay.", "thanks for your input."]}
