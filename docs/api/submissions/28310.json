{"id": 28310, "submission_id": "170utfw", "title": "AITA for donating to charity to prove a point?", "selftext": "Throwaway for anonymity. \n\nI've been dating a new girl for a couple months, and overall it has been quite good. To date, we've mostly done outdoorsy dates, or stay in nights where one of us cooks, but in the few times we've gone out to restaurants, I have paid for her.\n\nThe other day, her, myself, and 4 of her friends went out for dinner at a Korean BBQ buffet. The buffet was about $40, plus pretty much everybody got a couple drinks. Once the bill came out, the total was around $400 after drinks and taxes. I asked the waitress to put my girlfriend and my food on a separate bill. As soon as I said this, the table went quiet and awkward, with my girlfriend's friends exchanging some glances and non verbal communication. My girlfriend then said to me sheepishly \"I was hoping you could pay for my friends too\".\n\nI immediately said that I had not agreed to that, and I would not be paying for anyone else. While I do have some decent savings and a fairly high income stream, I cannot be spending that kind of money on people I literally just met. My girlfriend didn't actually push the subject too much and seemed understanding, but what pissed me off was how her friends responded when she said that they would have to get their own bills. While I was paying my bill, one of them pestered me about how I should \"be the gentleman\" and take care of the ladies bills. However what set me off was one of them who made a comment something about my girlfriend originally claiming she was \"done dating broke guys\". \n\nI immediately snapped back at her, staying that my finances had nothing to do with why I was unwilling to pay hundreds of dollars on people I don't even know. She then said \"well if you really weren't broke, then you would prove it and pay the bill\". \n\nA devilish idea suddenly came into my mind. I asked her what's the first charity that came to her mind. She paused for a second before saying \"uuuhh, Water.org??\" I said perfect, pulled out my phone, and in the span of about 1 minute, I had entered my credit card info (thanks auto-complete) and a donation amount as the exact total of the bill for the table. I sent it through, and then showed the whole table my donation receipt. I then said \"I only give handouts to those who really need it, not spoilt entitled juveniles\", walked out, and waited for my girlfriend to come to the car.\n\nWhen she met me, she said that I was a huge asshole for doing that in front of her friends. I made the case initially that I had just made a sizeable charitable donation, but afterwards I did do some thinking. While I am happy to donate to clean water initiatives, the only reason I did it right there was in an attempt to prove a point and humble some people I deemed entitled. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Was I an asshole for donating to a good cause, but for the wrong reasons?", "created_utc": 1696543359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170utfw/aita_for_donating_to_charity_to_prove_a_point/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had every right to feel upset, you were being used. Their reactions and replies to your discomfort was even more entitled and bullying, and in the heat of the moment you pushed back on the bullies and made your point.

That was masterfully done, the perfect level of petty in a way that no one can be rationally mad at you for. But can you honestly say you weren't trying to be an A H in that situation, no matter how deserved?\n\nYou let someone being petty get under your skin and, rather than being the adult of the situation, you decided to make things a spectacle. You put additional strain in the relationship between your girlfriend and her friends (arguably not great friends all around, but still) and by extension you and herself. \n\nIf you had just stuck to your guns but stayed silent, then confided in your girlfriend later that her friends are awful and she should distance herself from them, you'd probably have a good case and she'd respect you all the more for it. Now, she obviously knows her friends aren't great in that regard, but because you acted like an asshole too you can't really claim moral high ground.

They were trying to goad you and while they didn't achieve the exact desired result, you still got goaded into doing something you hadn't intended to. Don't donate to the first charity which pops up in a random asshole's mind when goaded, to prove that you aren't broke. Donate to charities that you believe in and, ideally, have vetted.
