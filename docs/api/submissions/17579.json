Not saying this is the case, but, I'd pay closer attention to your finances and her spending. Do this before marriage. Financial abuse is a thing, like i said, i'm not saying this is the case, but i'd be wary.\n\nMy advice is for going forward is for each of you to have a personal account. Be specific on what comes out of joint and what comes out of personal. Like with us. If i or she wants to go to lunch or breakfast. Anything under $20 comes out of joint. If she wants to take the office girls out to lunch or I take the buds to breakfast, that comes out of personal. Her purses and shoes/ my tools or woodworking materials that's personal account. Necessities like clothes and what not comes out of joint. Why not her shoes? She likes shoes and has a nice collection. Me i have $25 Walmart sneakers. If she wants a $200 dollar pair of shoes, she saves up or doesn't get them. It has to be fair and equitable and above all agreed upon by both. I have access to her account and she has access to mine for emergency use only. Real emergencies, not i wanted this purse and didn't have enough in my account sort of thing.\n\nMe and my wife only put $150 dollars a month in ours. It's not much, but that's us. I have a little over 2k in mine because i don't need to buy much and like to save up for larger purchases. Her account runs at about $50 - $75. We have a monthly \"money meeting\" to see what our balances are and always discuss possible purchases out of the joint account.\n\nEdit to add. Her having her own checking and savings account \"that she says she doesn't use\" concerns me. You should know how much is in that account. Is she setting up a \"Get out\" fund? Is she siphoning off from the joint account into hers? These are things that i'd be questioning after her getting mad about your $100 purchase. The only reason i can see that she'd be upset is if she has something to hide. For your sake, I hope this is not the case. Good luck.", "Most people often but some dumb things, at times.  However, what she may consider dumb is not the same as what you would consider dumb.\n\nI am glad you two have worked it out.  Communication  is important is a relationship.\n\nGood luck.", "Lol family legacy I am actively trying to break", "I appreciate this very thoughtful response. You are correct in that I should pay more attention and I will. I almost never look at the account because I assume we are fine and I see now that was a very naive approach that could put me in jeopardy should the unthinkable happen (a split).\n\nI really like how you and your spouse decide on what expenses come out of where. I might try that in our own agreement.\n\nShe really is a trustworthy and good person. Like a GOOD person so I\u2019m not worried. I think maybe what I spent it on wasn\u2019t OK with her. For example, I think $100 on a fantastic meal/drinks is ok. She thinks spending $100 on books and rocks (spiritual rocks, idk) is ok. Neither of us would spend money the same way so we think the other way is ridiculous."]}
