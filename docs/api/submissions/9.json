{"id": 9, "submission_id": "10bnywp", "title": "AITA for wanting to be pay for babysitting my own daughter?", "selftext": "My (39M) wife (34F) and I live in at a suburban house with our daughter (10F, Emily). Our neighbour next door (48M, Walter) is a single father with two daughters (14F and 12F). We have been living here for a little more than two years.\n\nMy wife really likes watching scary movies but I have never enjoy them. I get too scared and end up having a bad time so I prefer to avoid them. Her friends sometimes go with her to the more popular ones but she also likes older, indies and foreign horror movies. She has always had a hard time finding people that have this niche interest and that is why it was such a big deal when we met Walter and found out he also shares this tendency. They very quickly started to make plans to watch movies together. I was invited to be a part of this but refused.\n\nI prefer to just stay at home babysitting Emily and Walter's daughter while they are in their cinephile reunions. Sometimes they go to movie theaters but other times they just stay at Walter's place watching stuf at his home cinema. They usually have to go to another town in order to catch a specific function of some weird movie so it is normal for them to come back very late.\n\nThey eventually started doing stuff outside of watching movies, like going out for dinner. Walter invited all of us, including the kids, to go with him to a restaurant that a friend of him owned but I said no because it was too expensive. I don't like that kind of places because I feel they are a waste of money and didn't think the kids would enjoy it either. I insisted on staying with the kids and let the two of them go be themselves. This has became a regular thing and it is in a way a good deal for me because Walter pays for my wife's dinner and she can't no longer complain about me not taking her to fancy restaurants.\n\nAs both their movie and dinner nights had became so common, I have grown a little tired of the burden of constantly babysitting the girls. I talk to my wife and Walter about it and he explained that he usually does not like leaving his duaghters with babysitters. He says he is really comfortable knowing that they are being watched by an experienced father like me instead of some teenage girl. He nevertheless agreed that it was too much of a load for me and offered to start paying me a standard babysitter fee each time he goes out with my wife.\n\nI thought that was a fair approach to the issue but my wife was fully against it. She says I should not be paid for babysitting my own daughter nor the daughters of a close friend of our family like Walter. We have been arguing about this but she insists on this notion and it not open to change. She even gets mad every time I talk to her about this. Walter promised me that he will convince her but he does not seem to have been able to do so either.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1673701451, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bnywp/aita_for_wanting_to_be_pay_for_babysitting_my_own/", "score": 12626, "replies": ["This thread is now locked due to an excess of rule violations. \r\n\r\n[Sub Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/) ||| [\"FAQs\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\nWhile we have you, check out this [nifty info.](https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2022/09/06/new-research-discovers-the-elaborate-and-unique-way-seahorse-fat.html#:~:text=In%20seahorses%20and%20pipefish%2C%20it,and%20development%20of%20baby%20seahorses.)", "YTA For basically outsourcing your wife to the neighbour, you don't like scary movies ok, but to then say that its great that another man is taking your wife to what is basically dates so you dont have to?

It doesn\u2019t appear that you actually asked for money to watch your own kid. \n\nFor all the things you didn\u2019t explicitly ask about though, I\u2019m getting all sorts of AH vibes. First of all, if it\u2019s your kid, you are not babysitting, you\u2019re parenting. Any time a parent says that they are babysitting their own child, I question how involved that parent is in the upbringing and care of that child. I\u2019m betting your wife is Emily\u2019s primary caretaker. \n\nSecondly, at 10, 12, and 14, these kids really don\u2019t require much actual \u201cwatching.\u201c They are old enough to get their own meals and take care of themselves and entertain themselves. All you really need to do is make sure you\u2019re there in case of an emergency. The 14-year-old is old enough to watch the other two, if we\u2019re being honest. She\u2019s the age of a freshman in high school at this point. Walter needs to allow her to be more autonomous. \n\nThird, if scary movies aren\u2019t your thing, you watching Walters kids or just making sure they have a trusted adult to rely on in an emergency while he and your wife get their scary movie fix is a perfect thing to trade for Walter watching your daughter while you take your wife out every so often. While you have different interests, getting married doesn\u2019t mean you stop dating (unless you eventually want someone else to swoop in and start dating your wife). It sounds like Walter is dating your wife more than you are, even if their relationship is purely platonic. You indicated you don\u2019t enjoy taking her to fancy restaurants, but if she enjoys it, why are you so against the idea? \n\nLast, there is room for compromise here. If Walter has a movie room, why don\u2019t you and your wife and Walter and all of the kids get together once a week and watch a movie everyone enjoys?  It sounds like you don\u2019t want to be involved any more than you have to with either the fun stuff or the harder parts of being a parent. Step up and be an equal partner.", "You do know they're fucking, right? Lolol.", "who's gonna tell him?", "YTA.  You don\u2019t babysit your own kid.  The neighbor\u2019s child is a different story.
