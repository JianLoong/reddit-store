She discussed how she could be a \u2018bit crazy\u2019 sometimes (she\u2019s been diagnosed with BPD but refuses to stay in therapy or seek any kind of help for it) but she wants a guy who if she \u2018acts crazy\u2019 reflects on why his actions brought out that side of her and correct himself for the better. \n\nI didn\u2019t know what I was expecting to hear, but it wasn\u2019t that, and because it was unexpected I just started laughing. Because it just sounded so absurd to me. She\u2019s essentially saying \u2018It\u2019s not me, the person who acted in an irrational way and has a literal illness, that needs to work on it, the other person needs to tiptoe around me\u2019. So that caused me to laugh, but I stopped, and said sorry.\n\nShe demanded to know why I was laughing, and I said \u2018it\u2019s nothing\u2019, but she insisted I tell her why, so I explained to her why it just sounded ridiculous to me that she\u2019s putting the burden of her actions on a guy rather than herself. Like, she\u2019s an adult? She\u2019s in control of her own actions? A guy who is always deferent and like always puts her first 100% of the time when she doesn\u2019t put him first at all seems too high of a standard \n\nShe got angry and said I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to live with a mental illness and I\u2019m being insensitive.

I don\u2019t expect my spouse to tip toe around me and my bullshit. Your sister sounds like she has a little maturing to do.", "NTA. That's not \"high standards\"; that's being emotionally abusive.", "NTA. Your sister is fixing to be one of those girls we all tell guys to get far away from. No one is responsible for her actions but her - especially if she is aware of her mental illness but chooses not to stay in therapy or get any other kind of help for it. I hope she doesn't actually go into any relationships with that actual mindset. Yikes.", "NTA, she wants a partner she can emotionally abuse", "NTA and at 15, you have a more realistic and reasonable idea of relationships than she does. She's better off single, until she takes her mental health seriously.", "NTA. This isn't like flickering the lights on and off around an epileptic. A guy is not responsible for triggering her disease. I had a roommate in college who was bipolar and expected to be catered to. She quit her meds and it got scary. Your sister needs to take care of herself.", "NTA. BPD is a very tough disease that is extremely difficult for those who have it. I get that. But a characteristic of it seems to me (not a mental health expert but family to someone who has it) to be a refusal to take responsibility for ones own role in the situations that develop. Yes they are ill, yes they deserve understanding, but that does not constitute a free pass to act in a hurtful manner and then insist that it is the responsibility of the person they hurt to take responsibility for causing the hurtful action.  Its a tough truth, but one people with BPD need to understand if they want to have good relations with other people.", "NTA-\n\nI have both family members and friends that openly speak about their BPD. An we've had similar discussions about things like before, they would agree that just because they have a mental illness does not mean they get a pass to treat people horribly. Its not an excuse for them, an they take active steps to work on themselves if their mental health becomes a worsening issue. \n\nThey would certainly never blame someone for their own outburst or poor reactions. Not that ive ever seen them have \"crazy\" outbursts.", "NTA.  She's responsible for her own actions.", "NTA - Maybe laughing was inappropriate, but you immediately corrected yourself and apologized. You were willing to let it go, but she insisted you tell her, so you told her the truth.\n\nIt is a ridiculous standard for her to have. She is responsible for her mental health and her reactions. She doesn\u2019t get a pass to be toxic or abusive because she isn\u2019t choosing to acknowledge her autonomy or seek support.", "NTA. I know someone like this. No one will be able to meet that expectation. If she's conventionally attractive, she'll burn through partners at a ridiculous rate. Even the best guys won't last more than a couple of years. The most you can hope for is that she doesn't have kids, because they become an emotional lever to use on the rest of your family. Good luck!", "NTA. Glad you at 15 were about to bring her down to reality. That's not just mental illness, that toxicity. Her expectation is not too high of a standard. It's just absurd, narcissist-like trait where she can deflect blame and not take accountability for her actions.", "NTA, from a guy with multiple diagnosed mental illnesses. It\u2019s not a bad thing to have high standards, but hers are unrealistic. I\u2019d highly recommend that she continue with therapy if it\u2019s financially possible for her, it\u2019ll do wonders to help her find what she wants in relationships", "NTA\n\nShe's seeking someone to cater to her, kowtow, and grovel. That doesn't show maturity or even acceptance that she has issues that need to be addressed. She is responsible for her actions, but she's acting like it's someone else's responsibility.", "NTA. When my BPD was untreated I was very much the same. There's a fantastic book called Stop Walking on Eggshells (I think) that helps people deal with loved ones that have BPD because it's such a common trait. It's her responsibility to manage it.", "NTA. Mental illness is not a blanket Get Out Of Jail Free card for shitty behavior, especially for the people who don't do anything to get treated.", "NTA, and your justification sounds perfect to me - \"she\u2019s putting the burden of her actions on a guy rather than herself.\"  She's already decided to absolve her future self of all responsibility, and convinced herself it's reasonable.\n\nShe could have said she wants someone who remains calm and helps her to reflect on what things have caused her blowup - be they internal or external forces - instead of someone who gets easily stressed or defensive.  But pretending you're a prefect person who never does anything wrong, and trying to call it mental illness is not cool.", "NTA, no, but she probably doesnt even realize what she wants. she reads you laughing at her like you're judging her interpersonal abilities, which im sure she realizes aren't great, instead of as you recognizing the hypocriticality of it.\n\nsort of like if someone laughed at you if you said \"man i want to drive a lamborghini\" and their response was \"with your shitty credit? you can barely even cook dinner for yourself how are you going to deal with a car like that\" etc etc. It comes off as judgemental and you just meant \"i think it would be neat\", not \"i deserve this regardless\"", "You're not wrong.\n\nNTA", "NTA  \nYou were honest, and remarkably well-spoken for 15. She is setting herself up for a world of hurt by not getting help for her BPD, and that will spill over into any relationship she has. And frankly, she will likely find someone that will do that for her, but they will eventually tire of doing that and resent her for it. And let's be clear-- it's not bettering yourself by learning to walk through someone else's mental minefield.", "NTA\n\nI have serious mental illness. My mental illness & my actions are MY responsibility- no one else\u2019s. If people close to me want to help me, that\u2019s great but it is ultimately my responsibility. I am responsible for getting the care I need & taking my medication. You are absolutely correct & it seems she will just have to learn this the hard way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As you can already see she is setting up all her relationships to fail before they even get going", "NTA mental illness is not her fault but it is her responsibility", "She said that people that are medicated have a \u2018smell about them\u2019 and refuses to take meds. It\u2019s weird.", "High standards or victim profile?", "She has been in a few relationships with that mindset and they\u2019ve always ended really badly with the guys leaving because she treated them badly and her feeling she was the victim in all this and unloved", "I\u2019ve observed a lot of that in my sister as well. She does or says really impulsive, hurtful things to people, and then when they\u2019re angry, sad, or distant, she always gets really upset and cries and feels unloved. Sometimes she does see she\u2019s the one that caused it, other times she blames the other person for \u2018being upset\u2019, but she always puts her feelings of being upset first. It can be frustrating", "My sister does try hard to work on herself by like asking people what she did wrong and trying to work on it, but she refuses to go to therapy or get medicated, which is unfortunate", "She has had a lot of boyfriends, but it always follows the same pattern where she drives them away by repeatedly treating them poorly, and then when they leave her she feels like the victim and cries about how nobody loves her", "That\u2019s the most audacious thing I\u2019ve heard. She needs to take her mental health seriously. I was in her shoes for a long time and refused to take it serious. Then I took an extended grippy sock vacation and was forced to take it serious. Hate to put it this way but she\u2019ll learn one way or another.", "She's setting herself and her relationships up to just fail over and over if she doesn't get her mental illness under control and go through some therapy. I feel bad for everyone involved. I think it's good you voiced your thoughts.", "Well its good she asks, but her \"standard\" is not ok. Its essentially asking her future partner to be ok with emotional abuse.\n\nShe as an adult needs to take charge of her health and be treated properly through a professional. Hopefully she will see that it should be better for her to do so.\n\nLuckily she has a good sibling like you around, again NTA :)", "I hope so. Our family isn\u2019t big on mental health so she internalized that a lot.", "Seeing that referred to as a \u201cgrippy sock vacation\u201d is the best phrasing I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re in a good place now!", "I honestly don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be likely to go to therapy or get on medication any time soon because she\u2019s tried it before and always hated it.\n\n> Luckily she has a good sibling like you around, again NTA :)\n\nThank you", "I\u2019m sorry. I truly hope she gets the help she needs. BPD freaking sucks", "Wait there\u2019s another way to refer to it??? I got free socks (grippy) and it got me out of work for a couple weeks (vacation) lol", "I hope so too, but ultimately it has to come from her", "I bet the socks were the only thing that were free, though... \n\nWish you well!", "You are definitely NTA, and it's wonderful how you're recognizing that her personal improvement can only come from within her. Nobody else is responsible for her actions but her. Remember that even her being upset about what you said here isn't your fault - you weren't rude about it, and you first tried to spare her feelings by trying to move past your laughter rather than explain it. I don't think I would've been able to hold back a shocked laugh, either. Usually being laughed at would make people think twice about what they said and why, but it seems like your sister is used to externalizing all blame and always being the victim. Yikes.", "Yeahhhhh. I\u2019m hoping for a lack of grippy sock vacations in my future. Thank you! \u2764\ufe0f", "Wait...you are 15 and she's the adult??? It seems like the other way around.\n\nNTA\n\nShe's big enough to understand that any untreated problem can cause a difficulty into a person's life. Her untreated mental illness and constant downplaying of her part in abusing her old partners will hinder all of her relationships.\n\nHope she somehow realizes who the AH is in all of this.", "NTA", "This is what the 21 year old told the 15 year old?", "NTA.  She is deflecting her decision to not take treatment onto someone else\u2019s actions.  She is trying to excuse her mental illness by wanting people to change their actions based on her mental illness.  That is not how it works.  Maybe a soft YTA for laughing at her though", "You are NTA but take a lesson here and don\u2019t date entitled women like your sister.   \n\nThere are others like her!    Know the warning signs.", "That is textbook BPD."]}
