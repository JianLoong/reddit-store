I\u2019m the reason my parents got divorced (her words) and why she never had money when I was growing up (her words). \n\nTo save money, my mom refused to buy me anything when I was younger. I wore school uniforms that were too small for me because she didn\u2019t want to spend the money. Fellow classmates donated their old uniforms to me and my dad only found out when the school brought him and my mom in to discuss if they could afford to send me to that school.\n\nThings were downhill for most of my life and my mom made it difficult for my dad to have any contact with me. He wanted to be there but every time he bought me something (toys, clothes, food) my mom would either give it away or sell it then tell me it was stolen. It was only around 10 I started to realise that theft from a home (and especially my stuff) was not that common.\n\nIm aware of the damage it did to me and have been to a therapist to discuss things. She gave me a ton of healthy coping strategies to deal with my issues.\n\nWhen I hit 18, I ran for the hills and moved out at night when she was asleep and moved in with a friend. My dad was aware that I was moving out and insisted that I live with him. I chose not to as I knew it would cause problems for him so we had an agreement that he would help me with rent and food until I was able to stand on my own. \n\nWhen my mom realised I was out of the house, she thought my dad had taken me in and since the alimony had stopped she disappeared for years. No one knew where she was and essentially abandoned our home with everything still inside.\n\nI got my chickens in order and began working for a small company, saved every cent I have and I am now in a decent position with a car, savings and a hopeful future.\n\nRecently she got in contact with me again (not sure how she got my details) and told me she has been diagnosed with cancer. She demanded that I help her pay for the treatments and I told her I\u2019d think about it. I don\u2019t have nearly enough in my savings to pay for anything health related and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll ask for more if I agree to pay. \n\nI know for a fact that she has cancer since the hospital has contacted me to discuss payment plans. Even though our relationship is strained, I am still considering paying for it.\n\nSo all you wonderful people, WIBTA for not paying for her treatments?", "created_utc": 1680697951, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ciuan/wibta_if_i_didnt_pay_for_my_moms_healthcare/", "score": 675, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is not your dependent so don\u2019t let her force you to make her your dependent if you don\u2019t want to take all of that on. There are always other options she can pursue like government funded health care or asking the hospital to relieve some of the debt because she can\u2019t pay it (private hospitals in particular tend to write of a bunch of medical debt to remain not for profit). \n\nAlso, honestly unless you yourself look up the hospital to get their phone number yourself and call the number you find you don\u2019t actually know that you really were talking to the hospital. Phone scams are so common that I would never just assume anyone calling me asking for any kind of information that could be used to get your money or steal your identity isn\u2019t potentially a scam. Even if you decide to help her at the very least please look up the hospitals information for yourself and call them yourself to make sure she\u2019s not lying to you about this. \n\nYou truly have zero obligation to her and legally I\u2019d be surprised if you are obligated either. You may want to call the hospital though to make sure she didn\u2019t forge your signature or anything though so that if she did that you can get on top of that sooner than later. I say that because if the hospital called you it is possible that she did in fact forge your signature or something to make you financially responsible for her bills. If she did anything like that you may end up needing to get a lawyer involved. \n\nDefinitely NTA though but your mom sounds like she\u2019s definitely TA and always has been the AH to you. \n\nGood luck. \n\nNo matter what you decide to do you are 100% NTA though.

The fact you are even asking if you are given all of what you said further proves to me that you are Not The Asshole. On the flip side, everything you said also says your mom is and always was The Asshole to you. \n\nIn matters like this I always assume the worst because people who would treat you that way are definitely capable of doing anything to get what they want. Make sure she\u2019s not opening credit cards or anything using your information too. Maybe even lock down your credit or get some good credit monitoring set up so she can\u2019t possibly do anything like that to you without you knowing about it. We have done that in the past and it was worth the money for the credit monitoring service to have the peace of mind when we needed to make sure nothing would blindside us while we looked at buying a house, we didn\u2019t even suspect anyone was truly trying to do anything but my husband and his father have similar enough names that his stuff often ended up on my husbands credit and would drag his credit down. My brother who was named after our father had it even worse since they had the same name and my brother only had a II added to our dad\u2019s name. \n\nMake sure whatever you decide to do with your birth mother\u2019s hospital bills that it is for you and is what you want to do. Do not get guilted into something because \u201cfamily\u201d as that only seems to be used as a manipulation tactic. This is really about you and what you want to do. You do not owe her anything at all. She was legally responsible for caring for you until you were 18 so she cannot even say you owe her because she did so much for you for all those years. Those were all her choices to make as to what she spent on schooling and vacations and everything else when you were a minor. I\u2019ve seen parents start to use all of those years to demand repayment from their now adult children or to say their adult children owe them, etc but you did not have the power to make those choices or force her to spend money on anything while you grew up. She was the adult. She held the cards. She made the choices. Even if she had provided you with an amazing privileged childhood you still wouldn\u2019t owe her anything for providing that to a child. \n\nYou owe her nothing. I doubt legally you owe her anything either but you can double check to see if where you live adults are automatically emancipated or not though. I have a friend with parents pulling similar stuff and helped him find out if he was automatically emancipated or not so he knew he was legally protected from them as an adult.", "NTA you shouldn't pay for her.

TA for paying. \n\nYou already paid for her treatment. Every uniform she did not buy you, every toy stolen and sold, and every therapy session you paid for was you paying your mom. She got to keep all that money you wasted on therapy because she was a bad mother, and she pocketed your gift money and neglected you for uniforms. \n\nIt is not your fault she didn't save the money she stole from you. \n\nA note on Filial Laws:\n\nOnly one state (PA) aggressively goes after children. At least 10 states have no enforcement. Each state that has the laws has different standards, but generally, the following is needed:\n\n1. You have the ability and financial means to pay\n2. Your parent has existing medical bills\n3. Your parent is impoverished \n4. Your parent does not qualify for Medicaid\n\nSome super important factors are that in most states, you can face criminal charges, but it is only after you are sued by a health care provider and have a judgment. Your estrangement can be a mitigating factor or defense in a select number of states. \n\nCase law does exist and the most common reasons you have to pay are due to parents running from debt  or parents transfering you assets to you or selling assets to you below value and you refuse to pay for care. \n\nMost health care providers, to keep a non-profit status, do provide free care or rediced care if asked. Most large hospital chains will help attain medicaid. \n\nTo avoid legal trouble, I would recommend a free consult with an attorney, and they will most likely recommend responding to the hospital (or moving from your state if these laws are on the books) that you are unable to pay. Especially in PA. \n\nFilial law usually applies to nursing home care. These laws were on the books pre medicaid. Hospitals have a high burden as medicaid has a recovery program to go after the estate of the person first. Federal law trumps local and state law and can overturn a ruling that conflicts with federal law. \n\nA final note, filial laws were on the books pre-medicaid, social security, etc. The current interpretation is that a child may be responsible if the parent does not qualify for medicaid. The entire basis of filial law is that the parent can not pay. Low income people in most states qualify for medicaid. Your mom is too young to qualify under age. But she can qualify due to disability as well. ACA expanded protections quite a bit, and many states expanded coverage after this. \n\nYour mother may have told the hospital you volunteered pay even if it were not legally your responsibility or you can afford to, etc. It would make sense if you volunteered you in any state but PA as most other states don't have successful litigation against children under filial law. She may refuse to get medicaid. She may make too much money to qualify.   That is why I suspect a lawyer would recommend you respond with your inability to pay and inform you if state law could make you liable.\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo make sure you are not worried, I will simplify. Outside PA (due to different laws and successful cases vs. people who ran from debt or transfered property), the odds of a health care provider going after you. \n\nThe only reason they may try in most states is if they had a reasonable assumption you could afford it, mom was impoverished, mom did not qualify for medicaid, etc. That usually means your mom volunteered you or lied about your means based on OP. A key factor in most states is the debt already exists. That means she has a nursing home bill or existing treatment bills. These laws absolutely apply primarily to long-term care, such as a nursing home. Most states have limits on the length of care or responsibility. In all states, I am aware that bar PA or hiding assets, the health care provider, would need to go after your mom first as she must be impoverished. That means home sold, bank accounts drained, 401k cashed out, etc. \n\nI think this should be a strong determining factor if you pay. Your mom VOLUNTEERED you for her debt. This makes this automatically an NTA situation, and I would be indignant to not be associated with her, especially financially. If she does go into a nursing home, the law covers needed expenses after medicaid and is designed for fraud, mainly post medicaid. Any extras like food and quality of life items are not covered or your responsibility. Your mom is trying to screw you at 24, and you should act accordingly.", "NTA.
