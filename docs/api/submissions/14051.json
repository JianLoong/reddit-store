I\u2019m the reason my parents got divorced (her words) and why she never had money when I was growing up (her words). \n\nTo save money, my mom refused to buy me anything when I was younger. I wore school uniforms that were too small for me because she didn\u2019t want to spend the money. Fellow classmates donated their old uniforms to me and my dad only found out when the school brought him and my mom in to discuss if they could afford to send me to that school.\n\nThings were downhill for most of my life and my mom made it difficult for my dad to have any contact with me. He wanted to be there but every time he bought me something (toys, clothes, food) my mom would either give it away or sell it then tell me it was stolen. It was only around 10 I started to realise that theft from a home (and especially my stuff) was not that common.\n\nIm aware of the damage it did to me and have been to a therapist to discuss things. She gave me a ton of healthy coping strategies to deal with my issues.\n\nWhen I hit 18, I ran for the hills and moved out at night when she was asleep and moved in with a friend. My dad was aware that I was moving out and insisted that I live with him. I chose not to as I knew it would cause problems for him so we had an agreement that he would help me with rent and food until I was able to stand on my own. \n\nWhen my mom realised I was out of the house, she thought my dad had taken me in and since the alimony had stopped she disappeared for years. No one knew where she was and essentially abandoned our home with everything still inside.\n\nI got my chickens in order and began working for a small company, saved every cent I have and I am now in a decent position with a car, savings and a hopeful future.\n\nRecently she got in contact with me again (not sure how she got my details) and told me she has been diagnosed with cancer. She demanded that I help her pay for the treatments and I told her I\u2019d think about it. I don\u2019t have nearly enough in my savings to pay for anything health related and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll ask for more if I agree to pay. \n\nI know for a fact that she has cancer since the hospital has contacted me to discuss payment plans. Even though our relationship is strained, I am still considering paying for it.\n\nSo all you wonderful people, WIBTA for not paying for her treatments?", "created_utc": 1680697951, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ciuan/wibta_if_i_didnt_pay_for_my_moms_healthcare/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
