Last week we hung out with some of my friends, who she is familiar with and has met several times. We went to a few different bars and were drinking for almost the entire day, and my girlfriend didn\u2019t get the chance to eat much beforehand. About 5-6 drinks later, I was buzzed and she was pretty drunk. \n\nWe ended the night at my friend Matt\u2019s house. There were 6 other people there, all my good friends from college and their partners. My girlfriend sat down on the couch and almost instantly fell asleep while the rest of us played drinking games. I checked on her a few times and she was fine but completely asleep. \n\nA few hours later, I was ready to head home since there wasn\u2019t enough room for me to stay at Matt\u2019s. I called an Uber and decided to leave my girlfriend asleep on the couch to avoid issues with getting her to the car, waking her up, and potentially having a very drunk person in the Uber which would have been embarrassing for both of us. I told Matt and his girlfriend to please just let her stay on the couch, and I\u2019d be back to pick her up first thing in the morning.\n\nWhen she woke up at around 5 AM, she sent me a long series of texts asking why I left her and was clearly upset that I didn\u2019t take her home. I offered to come pick her up, but she refused and said she was calling her own Uber \u201csince I don\u2019t care about her.\u201d I have since apologized over text but she has not responded.

She might have woken with a simple shake, rubbed her eyes and joined you quickly. But no.\n\nNot only that but you left her asleep in the home of relative strangers and didn't even leave her a message or send her a text so that she could have seen it when she woke up.\n\nEdit - you say she's familiar with your friends but you've only been together for 16 weeks, so even if she's met them a few times they're still strangers.", "Hard YTA.\n\nYou left your vulnerable, passed-out girlfriend with people who are not her friends, without her consent.\n\nI imagine she was quite freaked out and feeling very unsafe when she woke up and you weren't there.  \n\nHonestly, don't be surprised if she is re-evaluating the long-term potential of a relationship with a guy who has so little concern for her safety and comfort.", "YTA.\n\nYou left your drunk, passed-out girlfriend in an unfamiliar place with people she barely knows.", "YTA - what a horrifying and unsafe situation you put your girlfriend in. I can\u2019t imagine how scared I would be as a woman waking up alone in a strange house with men I don\u2019t know.", "YTA. You left her alone with your friends she had only met a few times. That's super messed up.", "Bro?! Seriously dude?! Come on. Yes YTA. You stay with your partner dude.", "YTA - there is no version of reality where you abandoning your date at someone's house like that is ok.", "YTA. Just because she's met these people \"several times\" does NOT mean she's comfortable being left alone sleeping at their house.  You may trust them enough to sleep over, but that doesn't mean she does. Also imagine how she felt to wake up there, confused, only to find out that her boyfriend just bailed on her.  Not cool.", "YTA. Dude, you messed up so catastrophically. You would be lucky to even have a relationship after this. I get that you were drunk, but this was straight up negligent. She doesn't know your friends as well as you do, so they may have been stand up people from the few times she's met them, but that can change over time. You have no idea the danger you could have possibly put your girlfriend in because you thought, \"Oh it's my buddy's house. She'll be perfectly fine.\" Well, news flash, she wasn't fine when she woke up to see that you freaking left her, dude!", "YTA that's all there is to it", "YTA. You left her in an unfamiliar place, with your friends, not hers.", "YTA.  And I\u2019m pretty sure you spelled ex-girlfriend wrong.", "YTA. Wow. Just wow.", "YTA she is depending on you to keep her safe she barely knows those people and who cares if it was \u201cembarrassing\u201d for you to load up a drunk person to ensure you guys both get home safe", "You didn't want to be embarrassed (potentially) so you left her behind. \n\nYTA", "YTA. You left her with people she barely knows being as drunk as she was because you didnt want to deal with her. Like what if one of your friends is secretly a predator? She could have been taken advantage of because you left her alone. I'm just saying you never 100% know people.", "YTA.\n\nI can't even believe you're asking this. You didn't even give her the opportunity to participate in the decision simply because you didn't want to be inconvenienced or embarrassed. And think about it from her side. The last she knew, there was a group gathering going on. The next thing she knows, she's alone in a dark room and not 100% sure where she might be. For a woman, that can often be frightening. She would have also felt abandoned and rightfully so because that's exactly what you did.\n\nYou should have woken her up, said you wanted to head home, and asked if she wanted to sleep there or wake up more to go home with you.\n\nShe's likely to be upset for quite a while over this one.", "Definitely YTA. I don't blame her for being annoyed. She was left in a potentially unsafe situation", "YTA this is fucking terrifying. This is how women end up being raped by dudes they trust at parties. She trusted you to look after her while she slept and you just went and left her with a group of men who could have done god knows what to her. I'd never trust you again, and I don't think I'd ever want to sleep anywhere near you after that.", "110% you are TA", "Yeah YTA", "Yta 100%", "YTA. Should have taken her with you or stayed there yourself.", "YTA U have to genuinely be stupid like in her own words do u even care? Cause this was actually so braindead", "You left your girlfriend with your friends whom you trust but she may not. Thats not okay to leave someone alone like that. You should\u2019ve asked Matt for a blanket and camped on the floor with her. I hate drunks and refuse to participate in any event that may leave me responsible for them, but you condoned her behavior by drinking along. YTA", "YTA Plus I think it's going to read my ex-girlfriend because she's probably dumped you and rightfully so. That was an uncaring and asshole move.", "Hard YTA.\n\nYou just taught your girlfriend (potentially ex-girlfriend) that you will prioritize your convenience over her safety.", "YTA", "Yes YTA could you not have slept on the floor at least if you didn't want to wake her?? You abandoned her, drunk, in an unfamiliar place, for your own comfort.", "YTA. Your reasoning is poor. You played drinking games all through the night while she slept it off, but you didn\u2019t want to bring her into an Uber because she would be really drunk? You left your girlfriend, at a YOUR friends house. Possibly a stranger to her, and surrounded by other strangers. No one wants to think poorly of their friends, but rape happens. You do not leave your loved ones vulnerable without explanation. You didn\u2019t even leave her texts of what you planned out for her to wake up to in the morning. I hope for your sake you don\u2019t behave this ignorantly often, and it was mostly just the alcohol and you being tired and lazy. You need to seriously sit down, admit how badly you fucked up, and apologize from the heart. 4 months in? I\u2019d leave you for this", "YTA. \n\nYou set her up to be *not only* to be at risk for date rape by your \"buddies\"; but it sounds like you would probably blame her for it, if anything DID happen to her. \n\nYou failed at a very basic partner task: make sure your partner gets home safely. \n\nIn fact: you completely abandoned her. \nI'm not surprised you're this clueless; just digusted.", "WTF did you do. You left a woman who thought she was safe with you, alone, unconscious and probably somewhat drunk on a couch. Why would she stay with you? Do you know what happens to woman who are vulnerable when no one is watching? Do you know what you've done to her? I don't care if you've know these guys for 80+ years you don't get to make that decision.\n\nYTA and I hope your single now.", "YTA", "YTA And i want to add that was dangerous. I know of a situation where a friend left his longtime gf asleep on the couch at another couple's house who they were both friends with around 3am The trouble happened when some very drunk friends who had left ended up returning. The couple who lived at the house ended up going to bed, leaving the friends drinking on the porch. Well you can guess where this story was going. No one thought these guys couldn't be trusted but they couldn't. I'll end it there, but never leave your partner helpless and drunk out of your sight until safely home.", "YTA. Most rapes occur by friends or close acquaintances. By leaving her with your friend and her being wasted, you set her up for being taken advantage of. You should've taken her home with you.", "The first time I ever met my friend\u2019s new boyfriend, now husband, we were all at a party and drinking. My friend was very good friends with everyone there, and the boyfriend was new to pretty much all of this. Friend got drunk, passed out on couch. Again, she\u2019s good friends with all of us, male and female. We tell boyfriend it\u2019s cool if he needs to go, she\u2019s down for the night, party is winding down, all is well, several of us are staying over since we were drinking. He just very politely said \u201cno thanks, I\u2019ll just stay here!\u201d And sat by her all night. Slept occasionally on the floor next to the couch but never left. Sealed himself to us that night. 20 years later they are happily married and he\u2019s one of our best friends. But that night, even though we were friends with her, he didn\u2019t really know us, and sat by his date all night to make sure she was safe. \nAnyway, YTA.", "YTA big time. You would have to kill me before I left any of my FRIENDS let alone my partner drunkenly asleep in an unfamiliar place.", "YTA you left her with people she has \"met a few times\", passed out from drinking?  OMG.  You should have taken her home in the Uber or stayed there with her.  You had 2 good options, and one terrible, and you picked the terrible one.", "YTA\n\nNot spreading hate or sob stories but this happened to me once. My now ex-boyfriend left me at his friend's house. When I woke up, my top blouse buttons were undone and there were jizz stains on my bra. Not saying your friends would do that, but it's a dangerous situation no matter who is involved.", "YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA\n\n\nDO YOU KNOW HOW OFTEN WOMEN GET SEXUALLY ASSAULTED??????????ANY CLUE?????

I can\u2019t believe you left your passed out girlfriend with people other then yourself.

Are you this selfish and self-absorbed in all other aspects of your relationship? I hope not, for her sake. You took her out drinking.

I hope she\u2019s an ex, no normal woman deserves to have a prize like you", "YTA SO MUCH!", "Have you no instinct or will to protect your girlfriend?

Don't be surprised if you never hear from her again.", "YTA. You always let the drunk partner know you\u2019re leaving and give them the opportunity to come with.

YTA for not leaving her a note or a text telling her that.", "YTA. Your intentions were not bad, although, if you're so easily embarrassed by her, maybe call it quits  - but you are her only link to these people. She trusted YOU to get drunk and passed out around, not them. She would rightly feel like she was a responsibility you took on but then foisted off on other people.", "It sounds like you had all good intentions, and it\u2019s not entirely fair to nitpick how you handled it when you were also drinking, but of course she was shocked to wake up alone in your friends house. \n\nThings I would expect:\n1. Gently wake her and ask her if she can get up or if she wants to sleep there\n2.  Sleep on the couch with her \n3.

Which also is shitty.", "I hope this is so!", "Why did you remain friends with them and continue to be around them if you couldn't trust them?", "why are you admitting to being friends with predators", "New strategy: when you know someone is actively dangerous to others, stop hanging out with them.", "Get new friends!\n\nGo to different parties. \n\nReport the predators to police", ">I learned at a very early age that I could not trust my \u201cfriends\u201d and I never did anything like this because they would all have been wasted and would have all violated her!\n\nYTA for being friends with rapists, holy shit", "If you actually don't know, you're beyond help", "TY! like what kind of friends do these people have that their immediate thought is danger???  he left her with his friend and his friend\u2019s girlfriend\u2014not a fraternity.", "He was also drunk, he just couldn't be bothered to deal with her.", "I'd rather my GF embarrass me than put her in a situation where she feels unsafe", "Seriously? Why is dude friends with rapists \ud83d\ude33", "I meant was it full rape,just touching or was it one of them or all and what was the aftermath?", "Yea but it's aita, every situation is exaggerated beyond common sense. Posters rush to the worst case scenario everytime, there's no middle ground or shades of grey. And god forbid any poster have a different perception.", "These responses are so dramatic. She knew the friends fgs, its not like he left her in a strangers house.", "Why tf do you want to know details like that? Why is that important to you? Jeez dude. What is wrong with you?", "Do you know how little time 4 months is? Especially when just casually meeting them through a BF? Women get assaulted while drunk by men they've known for years. She had every right and reason to feel unsafe. Pointing that out isn't dramatic at all. Do you know how much avoiding SA and thinking about it and being aware of situations your in factors into our every day lives?", "Statistically speaking we're at most risk from men we know, or who are friends of people we know.", "They were his friends, not hers. She had met them a couple times. That doesn't equate to she's comfortable being passed out alone in their house. Also, maybe she trusts those people completely but just wanted to go home and sleep in her bed? \n\nAt the VERY LEAST bf could have woken her up and asked what she would rather do - head home with him or stay where she was and keep sleeping. \n\nHe didn't leave her there because he thought she'd be happier or safer, he left her there because he didn't want to be bothered.", "I'm not fucking asking you so bugger off. I wanted to know because I wanted to see how far they went and what happened after regards the law"]}
