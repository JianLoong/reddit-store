I embraced the culture and language. Berit said the language was hard and pretty much always complains about everything here being different than in the US. Her approach has been to bunker down in their 1-bedroom condo and avoid contact with the outside world.

One of the twins is developmentally disabled and shortly after they were born, the family had a visit from a therapist and nurse to work with the baby. What they saw there caused them to report Preben and Berit to the county. The local equivalent of CPS made regular visits for about 2 years. Berit and Preben were under constant threat of having the babies removed. \n\nThe reasons were: unsanitary conditions with rotting/moldy food all over the kitchen; dog drool on all surfaces, the small garden is ankle deep with dog doo and the poor dog is is confined to one room most of the day, rarely gets walks, and is untrained; ashtrays overflowing with mountains of cigarette butts; leaving the kids alone for extended periods of time crying in their cribs while parents game or talk to neighbors; not bathing or changing the babies frequently.\n\nCPS dropped the case a year ago, after most of their demands were met (aside from rehoming the dog). Recently we met up with Berit and one of the twins for a playdate. She remarked on my daughter's language and social skills. My wife said our daughter is very average and a little behind the curve language-wise, but that going to preschool has been a really huge help for her (kids here usually start at combo daycare/preschool around 10 months). Berit didn't want her kids coming home speaking a language she couldn't understand so she kept them home this whole time, which has put them behind in social development.\n\nShe said maybe she should consider sending the kids to preschool. She then said she feels like a bad mom for not doing it sooner. I said \"well CPS doesn't usually open cases on families if they are shining examples of great parenting.\" She got mad, said I was a judgmental ass who doesn't know how much of a struggle twins are, and took her kid home. \n\nMy wife says that while she agrees with me, I shouldn't have said anything.

I work with low-income and at-risk youth at a HS and I see what this kind of parenting does.", "NTA but you could have phrase it differently. Is she planning on home schooling the kids, because at some point those kids are going to need an education. Those kids could actually help her with learning the language. Baby books are great for that.\n\nHonestly, I don't understand why she would move to another country if she wasn't prepared to learn the language. I am French, didn't speak English until I move to England to follow my now husband. Once in the country I learn some basics through a language school (never been good with learning languages particularly with my dyslexia), watch lot of TV, got a job in a care home...

Seriously, it was the size of a zit.  I don't know what prompted my son's 1st grade teacher to ask him where he got it, but he told her a knife did it.  Later he told her that our dog did it.  We had a new boxer puppy at the time so this was the most reasonable explanation.  Anyway, the teacher called CPS.  Interviewed my other kids.  In a meeting with the CPS lady she was like... \"you seem like a good mom, you have lunch with your kids a lot.\"  (They interviewed the staff at the school)  Then the dog story was brought up.  Our conversation ended with me saying... \"so to sum this up... I'm here because my dog did it.\"  That was an awful week where a bunch of stuff occurs in succession and this situation made me laugh.  I was like... \"yup that sounds about right.\"  The case was immediately closed.\n\nHad a long conversation with my son about how if he told lies like that he could be taken from me.  I figured fear would motivate him to be truthful.  He's 14 now, and all is well.
