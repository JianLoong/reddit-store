My wife (36F) and I (37M) have 3 kids (11, 8, & 6).  My SIL (34F) and her husband (35M) have 2 kids (14F & 10M).  There is a waterpark about 20 minutes from the campground and I thought that would be a fun way to spend a day and let the kids get energy out.  We talked with SIL and her husband about this a couple weeks ago and they agreed it would be fun.  The waterpark had a family package deal going on, so I bought passes for all of us and SIL venmo'd me their share.  \n\nLast weekend, SIL called my wife and told her that her daughter doesn't want to go to the waterpark and asked if I could cancel the passes and refund her their money.  The reason she doesn't want to go is that she's struggling with body-image issues and doesn't want to be in public in a swimsuit.  I looked up the refund policy and due to it being a special holiday weekend deal, they would only refund 50% of our money.  \n\nOur kids still want to go to the waterpark, it's all they have talked about since we bought the tickets.  I admit I didn't look at the refund policy when I bought the passes because we had already discussed it with SIL.\n\nI suggested to my wife that we keep the package deal, and if SIL and niece don't want to go, they don't have to.  But everyone else can still go and use the passes we already paid for.  We could even give SIL money back that would be equal to the 2 people not going.  My wife suggested this to SIL but she shot it down.  SIL said that she's not going to exclude her daughter from a family outing like that.  She said that's just going to reinforce her body-image issues and show her that we aren't being supportive.  \n\nI told my wife I'm not going to cancel an entire outing just for one person, especially when we already paid for it and our kids are looking forward to it.  I told her if SIL is going to be difficult about it, we'll just keep the passes, go by ourselves, and give SIL her money back.  We would still save a little bit of money that way compared to buying new passes for just our family.  \n\nBut my wife started agreeing with her sister that this is supposed to be a family trip and we shouldn't split up and do separate things or do something that is going to exclude anyone from participating.  I told her I don't agree with that thinking and that we are totally OK going and doing something by ourselves for one day.  \n\nI told her if she agrees with SIL on this, then she is going to have to be the one to break the news to the kids.  I told her I'm looking forward to the waterpark just as much as the kids are and that if he wants to cancel it, she gets to deal with disappointing our kids.  \n\nNow my wife thinks I'm being a jerk and that I'm essentially ok with excluding my niece and that I'm bordering on fat-shaming her.  She is also upset that I would make her break the news to the kids because we should approach that sort of thing as a team and not make her the bad guy.", "created_utc": 1683830649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ew2po/aita_for_not_changing_plans_to_go_to_a_waterpark/", "score": 592, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister agreed to go, purchased the passes and now has changed her mind because of her daughter and THAT IS 100% OK. In fact, I LOVE that she's supporting her daughter. That makes her a wonderful parent for not telling her daughter to \"get over it\" or making her feel bad. Hopefully the daughter is getting therapy for her self image.\n\nTHAT SAID, your sister is 100% wrong for trying to get everyone else to change their plans. It's completely unrealistic and your kids are looking forward to it, so take them to the water park and your sister can do something else special with her daughter that day.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't excluding anyone, you specifically *included* everyone.\n\nYou are not fat-shaming, you just aren't letting one person's individual issues dictate what you and your family do on your family vacation.\n\nBeing a 14 y.o. isn't easy. But your SIL is essentially letting the body issues hold everyone hostage and that's just not how life works.", "nta, it sucks that your niece is struggling with herself right now, and i\u2019m gonna sound like an ah for saying this but life goes on. you\u2019re not wrong for wanting your kids to have a good outing, with or without everything there", "NTA\n\nRefund price to ones that refuse to attend. Go with the kids that want to attend. \n\nDepriving the kids that want to go due to one is unfair.", "NTA.\n\nYour alternative solutions were reasonable. It isn't fair that in catering to one person (after the event was agreed on, planned, and paid for), everybody else should sacrifice something they we're excited about.", "NTA, your SIL needs to make your niece understand that it\u2019s perfectly fine for her to not go if she\u2019s having body image issues but she can\u2019t expect others not to miss out on fun as a result. She\u2019s not helping her daughter manage her expectations and it will be problematic later in life if she expects everyone to drop what they\u2019re doing because she feels bad.", "NTA\n\nI am so sick and tired of hearing the \"because it's family\" and use that as a reason to limit everyone or anything! What does being on a family trip have to do with going to the waterpark? People who want to go should go, and people should not be forced to go with they don't want to go. Don't force either parties to do something they don't want. Jesus. \n\nYou can spend family time in different ways, not everyone will be on board with the same ideas and plans... When I was a pre-teen I had similar issues, so I would just opt in to be by myself and find my own things to do that were fun to me. My family would respect it after I reassured them that I am 100% being on my own. The point of a trip together as a family is to enjoy being together, not forcing stupid ideas down other people's throat for the sake of \"family\". There will be far more resentment than just letting people do what they want or openly opt out of activities that make them feel uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nThe big problem. I see is that the time for a good way to do this has passed.\n\nYou are not excluding your niece. She is excluding herself.   All that the adults are doing is giving her the option.\n\nCanceling the entire event, exactly what reason are you supposed to tell your children?\n\nOne way or another, It will come out that the whole thing was canceled because of your niece.\n\nYou are much better off having your niece invited to the water park in whatever swimwear/cover up makes her comfortable.", "NTA but let me see if I have got this right. 9 people originally going and you got the go ahead for all of them. Then 1 decides they don't want to go and now wife says you're being a jerk and okay with excluding your niece and bordering on fat-shaming her?? How did the fact that your niece has decided she doesn't want to go get turned around to you excluding her? That's some massive big time spin-doctoring there. I don't get it. At all. Niece doesn't want to be in a swimsuit, then she can wear clothes and read a book poolside while everyone has a good time. \n\nAnd also your wife IS the bad guy in this. There is no reason why two entire families should be taken hostage because of one person's insecurities.", "NTA and I can\u2019t get over the extreme entitlement of your SIL. Her daughter is having issues so NO ONE can go? Gimme a fkn break.", "NTA Personally I wouldn\u2019t let my spouse disappoint our kids. Your SIL and wife are being unreasonable. It\u2019s not going to kill the vacation if you do something with your kids for one day.", "NTA but it's tough being 14 (f) and hormonal with body issues. I get why she might not want to go. \n\nThat being said, I think what you offered is fair. They can just sit the day out and do something nice together instead for the day, I don't see why everyone's plans have to be cancelled.", "NTA...you're not doing anything to your niece by keeping your plans. If your wife is so upset she can stay with SIL and you take the kids. There is no rule that everyone has to be together 24/7 on a vacation.", "Wow. NTA. So if your niece doesn't want to go *no one* gets to? \n\nI totally get body-image issues, especially at that age but what you offered was more than fair. Sounds like SIL thinks your world should revolve around hers. How is it fair to your kids if you cancel? It's just not, and I can't imagine your kids thinking too kindly of their cousin for causing the cancelation of the trip. \n\nIf SIL wants to be supportive to her daughter in this, she could turn that afternoon into a mother/daughter spa day and help boost her daughter's self-image by pampering her a bit.", "NTA. Support what a lot of other comments have said. Also\u2026kids need to realise that life won\u2019t always revolve around them your SIL is reinforcing this. Although I\u2019m not condoning fat shaming or anything like that.", "NTA If your wife wants to disappoint your children, it's up to her to deliver the bad news. You've offered a number of solutions short of cancelling and none are acceptable to your wife so it's her responsibility to explain it to your children why the trip to the water park is cancelled.", "NTA. If this was such an issue why wasn't it brought up originally? It's not great to cancel at the last minute. I also agree that you don't just cancel an outing for one person and the kids were looking forward to it. The whole world doesn't revolve around your SIL's daughter. There is literally no rule that families have to be all together for outings.", "NTA - I'm sorry your niece is having body-image issues.  Hopefully she will get the help she needs.  \n\nHowever, having the entire family cancel an event they're all looking forward to because of 1 person not the right solution.   Even on family trips, you don't have to be with your family 24x7.   \n\nMaybe your niece and SIL can find something they want to do that you kids don't during this time.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s short notice to change plans. \nIf 14 year old niece has body issues it shouldn\u2019t affect the entire family. It\u2019s up to SIL to work with her daughter and find a bathing suit that she\u2019ll be comfortable wearing. There are sooooo many options now that are modest and comfortable.\n\nI don\u2019t wear regular bathing suits. There are board shorts, tank tops and full bathing suit shirts that are like T-shirts that she can wear.\n\nSIL is being unreasonable and not dealing with an issue that is bigger than a water park trip in an appropriate way.", "NTA. I completely get the body image issues. But how is going to a water park that she doesn't want to go to fat-shaming her? SIL can take this time and do something fun with her daughter, just the two of them. My kids love one on one time with parents sometimes. One person shouldn't get to essentially tell her brother and 3 cousins, I don't want to go so you can't either. That's not fair. Give her her money back and take your family. They are ridiculous.\n\nINFO: Has anyone even bothered to ask your niece if she even *cares* if everyone else still go to the park? She might not.", "NTA. Canceling a trip everyone is looking forward to because one girl thinks she's fat? That's crazy. Her mom could take her to do something else that day or, like my family would have done, tell her tough shit, toss her a big t-shirt and head to the Waterpark. She can sit on a beach chair in a fully covering sweat suit if that's what she wants to do but I feel like once she got there she'd see how much fun everyone is having and join in.", "I\u2019m on mobile idk how to quote properly but \n\n\u201cSIL said that she's not going to exclude her daughter from a family outing like that.  She said that's just going to reinforce her body-image issues and show her that we aren't being supportive.\u201d\n\nHow is cancelling the entire outing not also reinforcing her body-image issues? Idk how severe her issues are or what she\u2019s going through but I also had body-image issues growing up and being able to be around my family and people in public settings having fun with all different bodies helped me put it in perspective a bit. We all have \u201cimperfect\u201d bodies but we can enjoy them too. I\u2019d also say NTA btw", "NTA. I do feel for your niece, it's a difficult age and struggling with body image issues is not easy. However, you're offering to refund their full family tickets even though you only get 50% back. It's one day to spend apart so it shouldn't be that big of a deal. Besides, your kids will be bummed and likely talk about it on the trip and would make the niece feel guilty anyway. \n\nSIL could also use this opportunity to find swimsuits your niece would be comfortable with. They make full coverage tops and skirts that she may feel more comfortable in which would be better than letting her think she shouldn't do anything fun if she doesn't like her body.", "NTA.  There are so many wrongs here, but you're not one of them.\r  \n\r  \nLet's start with SIL.  She scheduled and paid for the waterpark. Now she wants to get a refund because one person (her daughter) doesn't want to go? I don't think she's entitled to any refund.  Also what about her son? He doesn't get to go because is sister doesn't want to? He's going to start seeing sister as the golden child whose whims override any plans (assuming that he has not already concluded this due to similar occurrences).\r  \n\r  \nNow your family... Your wife wants to cancel for your family. You're not making her the bad guy; she *is* the bad guy. Now one child's whim is killing the plans of two families. If she has the guts to cancel, definitely let *her* tell your kids that they can't go because their cousin decided not to go.", "NTA. Your SIL and wife are being unreasonable. If SIL doesn\u2019t want her family to go, they do t have to go, but they don\u2019t get to decide your family isn\u2019t going either. You\u2019ve already planned the entire outing and paid money that you cannot get back. You\u2019re wife is TA is she tries to force you into giving up something that was already set in stone when there\u2019s no real reason to. \n\nIf you feel you have to cancel the trip, make sure SIL reimburses YOU for the money you lose, because you\u2019re giving this trip up unwillingly.", "Nta. You are not fatshaming or excluding your niece. She is more than welcome to go. She has excluded herself due To her own insecurities. Also it's not fair to allow 1 person to spoil or veto actovities for everyone else. Plus if all the children to be deprived of a fun summer activity that they are eagerly anticipating because 1 person wants to hijack the vacation and her parents are supporting it its gonna cause major resentment amongst the chumdren. Are you going to deny all the kids ice-cream and burgers since niece is concerned with body image and may refuse to eat anything fattening? If one child gets a stomach ache are u gonna pour pepti down everyones throat.Of course not.\nKeep the passes...not only will you and your kids enjoy them but the niece may change her mind and both families can go. Regardless  the 2 families can enjoy time apart on vacation not every day trip or activity needs yall attached at the hip", "NTA, why can\u2019t your niece dress normal and play on phone or iPad?", "NTA\n\nNope.\n\nBending to the niece on this is sending two messages, first is 'we agree with your body issues, no one wants to see you in a swimsuit' and second is 'you are more important than the group and we will bend to your every whim'. There are only so many activities in the vicinity of the campground. This is the option that was agreed upon and paid for. \n\nIf the niece doesn't want to wear a swimsuit or participate, she shouldn't be forced. She can put on a cute summer dress, bring a book and camp out on a lounge chair. This could actually work really well for securing some chairs together and having a meet up spot should one of the kids need a break for a bit. Maybe eve throw her a few babysitting dollars for helping out.\n\nAdditionally, most of those waterparks have other activities for kids, such as arcades. Bring a deck of cards or a travel checkers board; the adults can take turns spending quality time with her. \n\nThe passes have been paid for and all the kids want to go except the one niece. If SIL really wants to stay behind with the niece, her choice, but everyone else should stick to the plan that was paid for. \n\nDo not let one child arbitrarily dictate the activities of the other children and the adults. Once that pandora's box gets opened, this will look like the tip of the iceberg of nonsense and drama. \n\nHave fun at the waterpark!", "NTA.  If you cancel the Waterpark it will take  5 minutes for the kids to figure out why.  They will decide that they are being punished because their cousin is fat.  After that the whole vacation will be \"We can't go to the Waterpark because you're fat!\" And then they will never stop picking on her.", "NTA, and do NOT cancel the passes. I get it, I was a teen girl once too, and it sucks feeling self conscious about your body, but that does NOT mean everyone else has to suffer. And what about SIL\u2019s son? Does he not get a choice in this? Why does he have to suffer because his sister doesn\u2019t want to go? \n\nPut your foot down on this because this is a family outing and one kid doesn\u2019t get to dictate what everyone does. Making everyone else unhappy is not going to help your niece at all. It could even make her feel worse because all the other kids will be upset with her. Instead you take the kids including your nephew.", "Show your wife this thread. NTA", "SIL is the AH.  And a bully. GO to the waterpark.  Have fun.  SIL & her daughter can fend for themselves for one day.  The world doesnt stop because someone is chubby.  As a middle aged woman I felt WAY better about my body after I got to the waterpark & saw all the other real humans with imperfect bodies just having fun & not giving a crap", "NTA. Your kids shouldn't be made to suffer because of cousin's issue. I'm glad they aren't making her go but she needs to learn that her issues aren't everyone's issue. And it's pretty crappy of your wife to want you to share responsibility for her decision with the kids.", "NTA. I hope you don\u2019t take this outing away from your kids. I was the fat kid/teenager. I had (have) massive body image issues. If I was invited to a water park, I\u2019d find a swimsuit I was mildly comfortable in. Life\u2019s to short to give up on fun because of these issues.", "NTA - if you're a team then you both would be in agreement. You're not agreeing to canceling plans. She's doing it unilaterally. She can deal with those consequences. That's called being a parent. Maybe SIL could try it.", "NTA. You do what you want with your family. Don\u2019t let your niece hold you all hostage. Your wife can skip too if she wants.", "NTA. A family vacation is about Everyone going, not the individual. \n\nNaturally everyone is allowed to say \u2018no thanks\u2019 to outings and activities and have that respected, but they do Not get to dictate what everyone else does.", "I was fat in water parks as a kid. If anything, avoiding these scenarios and having adults essentially *agree* that she shouldn\u2019t wear a swim suit in public is damaging. Your sil should hype her up and buy her a cute suit, and tell her to enjoy the water park, others\u2019 opinions be damned.", "NTA-  You suggested an activity and they agreed.  Tickets were purchased before they changed their minds.  \n\nGo enjoy the water on memorial day.\n\nTry and move the conversation past this one weekend - \u201c ok this weekend didn\u2019t work out best for niece.  It is too difficult to change that. We\u2019ll know to be more careful in the future.\n\nWhat else can we do to support her this summer.?\u201d", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nOmg the sensitivity is insane. Your initial plan of keeping the passes but refunding two for SIL and niece was completely rational. Let\u2019s say you spent $400- the park is only going to give you $200 back. That\u2019s only going to be $100 back to each family anyway, because it wouldn\u2019t be fair for SIL to get 100 percent of her money back and you take a complete loss of money and no tickets. \n   Niece doesn\u2019t want to go to the park, fine, have a mother daughter day exploring the town and clothes shopping or spa day. Do things to increase her self esteem and have quality time instead of projecting false fears and rules onto her and for the whole family to follow. If the niece didn\u2019t like chocolate, does that mean you\u2019re not allowed to eat thin mints? \n   Wife and SIL owe you and the family a huge apology for the nasty words and criticisms they said to you. Telling you you\u2019re not a good uncle and fat shaming bc you don\u2019t want to be out a family purchase? Puh-lease.", "Tell your wife you are taking the kids, with or without her.

The end.", "NTA How are you excluding the niece when she is the one deciding not to go? It's not fair to everyone else who do want to go. Why can't they just find something else to do while the rest go to the water park?", "NTA. I don't understand the mentality of, you're on a vacation with people and need to spend every freaking second together. When my family(Mom,Dad, 2 brothers, me, aunt, uncle and cousin) went to Disney or universal, we always split off. Why? Because 12 year olds don't want to ride 5 year old rides. \n\nIt's perfectly normal for people to do different things. Your wife should be the bad guy. That's what she's being. The kids have to suffer for something that has nothing to do with them that *maybe* the 11 year old would understand. Make your bed. Lie in it.", "NTA no one is excluding your niece. She decided she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable going. That doesn\u2019t mean she gets to ruin it for everyone else that doesn\u2019t have body image issues. That\u2019s selfish and unfair to expect everyone to bend over backwards to pacify someone else\u2019s insecurities.", "NTA\n\nGood for SIL for supporting her daughter.

My husband and I do not travel with anyone else. For this reason. NTA.", "Telling her daughter to skip the waterpark is not supportive. It's endorsing the idea that there's something wrong with her body to the point that others should not see it. I think she should go to therapy before the trip if possible and use the trip to work on those issues.", "So, the kid thinks she is too fat to go to the waterpark. The mother then agrees with her and tries to cancel the whole trip because the daughter is too fat to go to the waterpark and the whole family agrees and doesn't want to go with her. That is the complete opposite of supporting her. She is confirming the daughter's wrong thinking.", "Completely agree. A 14 year old might not want to go because of body image issues. Adults in charge of her should help her understand everyone isn't looking at her and it isn't unusual to feel that way about her body and she should not allow it to stop her living her life.", "My sister was just like this, and enabling her to avoid goddamn everything (while also guilting us for things like having friends or being good at her preferred hobby) has made her insufferable and ridiculous. None of her siblings have a good relationship with her.", "Agreed. It's signalling to the daughter that she is right in her thinking and that in fact the whole family thinks the same if they cancel the trip. Completely wrong.", "How is the teen entitled or a brat here? She's not the one saying the others shouldn't go to the park. Her mother is. \n\nAlso the kid clearly doesn't want to be rude Verner of attention. That's why she doesn't want to go to the park. She thinks she's fat and doesn't want attention so she ways to stay behind. \n\nThe mother said they will go - probably without asking the yeen if she wanted to- and the mom is throwing a fit and making demands.

Around here it is considered a hazard on slides.", "It's really not a good idea to wear T-shirts when swimming anyway. A shirt creates a lot of drag, plus the fabric soaks up water, so it's not very safe.\n\nNow, it is easy to find more modest swimsuit options these days. Cute ones. But she might not necessarily go for that. It might just make her feel more insecure than wearing a normal swimsuit. May be worth suggesting though.", "NTA.  Go to the waterpark.  As planned.  Ignore the other family.  Their family issue is not your family issue.", "Sooo...one person can stop everyone from going places, but no one is allowed to go somewhere on their own or in a small group that doesn't include everyone? For the entire duration of the vacation??\n\nYeah..that'll work.\n\nNTA\n\nStand your ground. Your niece has some issues she needs to work out, yes, but that does not mean she gets to make everyone miss out on the waterpark.", "NTA - are your kids boys or girls ?         \nIf they\u2019re all boys you could do a \u2018girls day\u2019 \u2018boys day\u2019 thing.       \nThat way your wife and SIL can stay with your niece and the boys can go to the water park.       \nOtherwise the other kids shouldn\u2019t miss out because your niece is having body issues.      \nHer mother should teach her to love herself not teach her to hide", "The time to cancel the waterpark trip was before any of the kids new about it, not after they were looking forward to it. Your SIL was fine with the waterpark trip at one point and no longer is because of her daughter. That is up to her, for her family, not yours. You are not fat-shaming your niece by still wanting to go. Strangers at the waterpark are more apt to be there having fun and not thinking about your niece's body or anyone else's for that matter. I went to my granddaughter's birthday party at an indoor waterpark in March. There were people of all ages, colors, body types, etc. No one was making fun of anyone else that I could see. They were just having fun with their own groups. At this point, it has nothing to do with your niece. It has everything to do with not disappointing your kids and yourself. Extended family vacations do not require everyone doing the same thing all of the time. A day out for a side trip that involves only one part of the extended family is fine. Your SIL and her family can plan something else for the day. Also, why should one person get to ruin the day for everyone? As far as telling your kids, your wife is the one that thinks it should be cancelled. She is in fact the \"bad\" guy for this purpose, not you. You want to take the kids and go. Stick to your guns.", "NTA.. your niece is excluding herself...", "Anyone else think canceling would send the wrong message to everyone involved?\n\nBecause it kind of feels like all the kids are being taught that if you feel ashamed of your body then you should hide it from the world. It feels almost like confirming there is something wrong with her body that prevents the family from enjoying it there.\n\nIt seems like there is a decent chance your kids will overhear the real reason for the cancellation, or be told it by one of their cousins. And I just can\u2019t imagine this will be a good situation for elementary school age children who were really excited to go to the park. Your kids thinking \u201cwe got this exciting trip taken away because X is fat\u201d or \u201cour cousins body is so shameful we had to cancel our trip\u201d does not seem like a situation that anyone would want to deal with. Even your kids don\u2019t find out the reason, their complaining might make niece feel worse if she blames her body for the family missing out. Just bad all around\n\nNTA", "NTA, put your foot down and take your kids.  They should not be punished because of your niece.  Your kids are a lot younger than her. They will not want to do things she wants to do.", "NTA", "Eff that team nonsense. Your wife blew the team thing up when she picked sides. The only one excluding niece is niece herself, and now her mother is trying to force others to revolve around her kid. \n\nFat shaming? Ladies, you are the ones telling that girl that she's right about her body and she should skip the event because of it. They aren't protecting her from anything AND no one is forcing her to wear a bathing suit or clothing that would make her self conscious. \n\nWhy should one person's personal problem effect a large group? OP, take your kids to the waterpark. Otherwise they'll lose faith in you. If I was a kid in this senerio, I would hold a grudge, sulk the rest of the trip and never ever let anyone forget this betrayal. I would hate my cousin and my aunt for ruining my trip over something like this. I have a feeling you will resent your wife if you cancel. I sure would. \n\nOP, your wife sucks so badly, grow a spine lady. I'm so disappointed in the women here (as a mother of girls). To ruin a planned family trip but using guilt tactics that the family \"needs to do everything together\" is asinine. If that's true, niece can suck it up and read on a blanket for a few hours while the rest of the family has their fun. This isn't empowerment, it's entitlement. Misery loves company, so company isn't allowed to have fun.\n\nI really hope you do right by your family and go enjoy your hard earned and expensive vaca with or without those 3. NTA if you put your foot down and protect your kid's trip. This power move is about more than just a waterpark.", "And SIL is entirely wrong by saying they are excluding her daughter. It was her daughter's choice not to go and everyone is respecting that choice. Nobody is being excluded.", "Yep like a Daddy Day. \n\nThat could actually work\u2026Mom Daughter and Aunt have a girls day (because also she\u2019s a lot older than her cousins/bro anyway) and the rest go to the water park. If one of the other kids rather do an outing, cool they can join too.", "Oh yeah that\u2019s true! So many options to mix and match. You can get a set that looks like a t shirt and shorts, plus there are tons of cut loose fitting swim cover ups.\n\nThey even sell swim bottoms that are like yoga pants. Some of my family members swear by them for camping trips with cold mountain springs.", "This. I would have the daughter come anyways. She doesn't have to swim. But bring the swimsuit in case she changes her mind. Hell, even go shopping extra with her to try to find a swimsuit/coverup she is more comfortable in. I don't think its fair on anyone for her to skip the waterpark. What does that teach her brother? It also reinforces the idea that she is right to have the body image issues. \n\nNTA.", "I\u2019m sorry but are you me? \ud83d\ude39", "I had the same thought. In this case, making everyone cancel would be the opposite of supportive. Plus, I imagine that the other kids might be resentful of the niece if the outing were cancelled, which might make her feel even worse.", "I still have body image issues. I have some men's swimsuit shorts, some women's bathing suit tops and a rash guard to keep me from sunburning and to hide what I want to keep hidden.", "Wear a rash guard. I burn like crazy and prefer to be as covered as possible.", "Not really. I always swam with a t-shirt because it helped me not get a sunburn. T-shirts can be lighter weight than swimsuits.", "Tankini top and kayaking shorts was my go-to for ages! They're the correct material and wouldn't stand out at the pool."]}
