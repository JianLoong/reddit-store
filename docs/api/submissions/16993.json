My wife (36F) and I (37M) have 3 kids (11, 8, & 6).  My SIL (34F) and her husband (35M) have 2 kids (14F & 10M).  There is a waterpark about 20 minutes from the campground and I thought that would be a fun way to spend a day and let the kids get energy out.  We talked with SIL and her husband about this a couple weeks ago and they agreed it would be fun.  The waterpark had a family package deal going on, so I bought passes for all of us and SIL venmo'd me their share.  \n\nLast weekend, SIL called my wife and told her that her daughter doesn't want to go to the waterpark and asked if I could cancel the passes and refund her their money.  The reason she doesn't want to go is that she's struggling with body-image issues and doesn't want to be in public in a swimsuit.  I looked up the refund policy and due to it being a special holiday weekend deal, they would only refund 50% of our money.  \n\nOur kids still want to go to the waterpark, it's all they have talked about since we bought the tickets.  I admit I didn't look at the refund policy when I bought the passes because we had already discussed it with SIL.\n\nI suggested to my wife that we keep the package deal, and if SIL and niece don't want to go, they don't have to.  But everyone else can still go and use the passes we already paid for.  We could even give SIL money back that would be equal to the 2 people not going.  My wife suggested this to SIL but she shot it down.  SIL said that she's not going to exclude her daughter from a family outing like that.  She said that's just going to reinforce her body-image issues and show her that we aren't being supportive.  \n\nI told my wife I'm not going to cancel an entire outing just for one person, especially when we already paid for it and our kids are looking forward to it.  I told her if SIL is going to be difficult about it, we'll just keep the passes, go by ourselves, and give SIL her money back.  We would still save a little bit of money that way compared to buying new passes for just our family.  \n\nBut my wife started agreeing with her sister that this is supposed to be a family trip and we shouldn't split up and do separate things or do something that is going to exclude anyone from participating.  I told her I don't agree with that thinking and that we are totally OK going and doing something by ourselves for one day.  \n\nI told her if she agrees with SIL on this, then she is going to have to be the one to break the news to the kids.  I told her I'm looking forward to the waterpark just as much as the kids are and that if he wants to cancel it, she gets to deal with disappointing our kids.  \n\nNow my wife thinks I'm being a jerk and that I'm essentially ok with excluding my niece and that I'm bordering on fat-shaming her.  She is also upset that I would make her break the news to the kids because we should approach that sort of thing as a team and not make her the bad guy.", "created_utc": 1683830649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ew2po/aita_for_not_changing_plans_to_go_to_a_waterpark/", "score": 205, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister agreed to go, purchased the passes and now has changed her mind because of her daughter and THAT IS 100% OK. In fact, I LOVE that she's supporting her daughter. That makes her a wonderful parent for not telling her daughter to \"get over it\" or making her feel bad. Hopefully the daughter is getting therapy for her self image.\n\nTHAT SAID, your sister is 100% wrong for trying to get everyone else to change their plans. It's completely unrealistic and your kids are looking forward to it, so take them to the water park and your sister can do something else special with her daughter that day.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't excluding anyone, you specifically *included* everyone.\n\nYou are not fat-shaming, you just aren't letting one person's individual issues dictate what you and your family do on your family vacation.\n\nBeing a 14 y.o. isn't easy. But your SIL is essentially letting the body issues hold everyone hostage and that's just not how life works.", "nta, it sucks that your niece is struggling with herself right now, and i\u2019m gonna sound like an ah for saying this but life goes on. you\u2019re not wrong for wanting your kids to have a good outing, with or without everything there", "NTA\n\nRefund price to ones that refuse to attend. Go with the kids that want to attend. \n\nDepriving the kids that want to go due to one is unfair.", "NTA.\n\nYour alternative solutions were reasonable. It isn't fair that in catering to one person (after the event was agreed on, planned, and paid for), everybody else should sacrifice something they we're excited about.", "NTA, your SIL needs to make your niece understand that it\u2019s perfectly fine for her to not go if she\u2019s having body image issues but she can\u2019t expect others not to miss out on fun as a result. She\u2019s not helping her daughter manage her expectations and it will be problematic later in life if she expects everyone to drop what they\u2019re doing because she feels bad.", "NTA\n\nI am so sick and tired of hearing the \"because it's family\" and use that as a reason to limit everyone or anything! What does being on a family trip have to do with going to the waterpark? People who want to go should go, and people should not be forced to go with they don't want to go. Don't force either parties to do something they don't want. Jesus. \n\nYou can spend family time in different ways, not everyone will be on board with the same ideas and plans... When I was a pre-teen I had similar issues, so I would just opt in to be by myself and find my own things to do that were fun to me. My family would respect it after I reassured them that I am 100% being on my own. The point of a trip together as a family is to enjoy being together, not forcing stupid ideas down other people's throat for the sake of \"family\". There will be far more resentment than just letting people do what they want or openly opt out of activities that make them feel uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nThe big problem. I see is that the time for a good way to do this has passed.\n\nYou are not excluding your niece. She is excluding herself.   All that the adults are doing is giving her the option.\n\nCanceling the entire event, exactly what reason are you supposed to tell your children?\n\nOne way or another, It will come out that the whole thing was canceled because of your niece.\n\nYou are much better off having your niece invited to the water park in whatever swimwear/cover up makes her comfortable.", "NTA but let me see if I have got this right. 9 people originally going and you got the go ahead for all of them. Then 1 decides they don't want to go and now wife says you're being a jerk and okay with excluding your niece and bordering on fat-shaming her?? How did the fact that your niece has decided she doesn't want to go get turned around to you excluding her? That's some massive big time spin-doctoring there. I don't get it. At all. Niece doesn't want to be in a swimsuit, then she can wear clothes and read a book poolside while everyone has a good time. \n\nAnd also your wife IS the bad guy in this. There is no reason why two entire families should be taken hostage because of one person's insecurities.", "NTA and I can\u2019t get over the extreme entitlement of your SIL. Her daughter is having issues so NO ONE can go? Gimme a fkn break.", "NTA Personally I wouldn\u2019t let my spouse disappoint our kids. Your SIL and wife are being unreasonable. It\u2019s not going to kill the vacation if you do something with your kids for one day.", "NTA but it's tough being 14 (f) and hormonal with body issues. I get why she might not want to go. \n\nThat being said, I think what you offered is fair. They can just sit the day out and do something nice together instead for the day, I don't see why everyone's plans have to be cancelled.", "NTA...you're not doing anything to your niece by keeping your plans. If your wife is so upset she can stay with SIL and you take the kids. There is no rule that everyone has to be together 24/7 on a vacation.", "Wow. NTA. So if your niece doesn't want to go *no one* gets to? \n\nI totally get body-image issues, especially at that age but what you offered was more than fair. Sounds like SIL thinks your world should revolve around hers. How is it fair to your kids if you cancel? It's just not, and I can't imagine your kids thinking too kindly of their cousin for causing the cancelation of the trip. \n\nIf SIL wants to be supportive to her daughter in this, she could turn that afternoon into a mother/daughter spa day and help boost her daughter's self-image by pampering her a bit.", "NTA. Support what a lot of other comments have said. Also\u2026kids need to realise that life won\u2019t always revolve around them your SIL is reinforcing this. Although I\u2019m not condoning fat shaming or anything like that.", "NTA If your wife wants to disappoint your children, it's up to her to deliver the bad news. You've offered a number of solutions short of cancelling and none are acceptable to your wife so it's her responsibility to explain it to your children why the trip to the water park is cancelled.", "NTA. If this was such an issue why wasn't it brought up originally? It's not great to cancel at the last minute. I also agree that you don't just cancel an outing for one person and the kids were looking forward to it. The whole world doesn't revolve around your SIL's daughter. There is literally no rule that families have to be all together for outings.", "NTA - I'm sorry your niece is having body-image issues.  Hopefully she will get the help she needs.  \n\nHowever, having the entire family cancel an event they're all looking forward to because of 1 person not the right solution.   Even on family trips, you don't have to be with your family 24x7.   \n\nMaybe your niece and SIL can find something they want to do that you kids don't during this time.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s short notice to change plans. \nIf 14 year old niece has body issues it shouldn\u2019t affect the entire family. It\u2019s up to SIL to work with her daughter and find a bathing suit that she\u2019ll be comfortable wearing. There are sooooo many options now that are modest and comfortable.\n\nI don\u2019t wear regular bathing suits. There are board shorts, tank tops and full bathing suit shirts that are like T-shirts that she can wear.\n\nSIL is being unreasonable and not dealing with an issue that is bigger than a water park trip in an appropriate way.", "NTA. I completely get the body image issues. But how is going to a water park that she doesn't want to go to fat-shaming her? SIL can take this time and do something fun with her daughter, just the two of them. My kids love one on one time with parents sometimes. One person shouldn't get to essentially tell her brother and 3 cousins, I don't want to go so you can't either. That's not fair. Give her her money back and take your family. They are ridiculous.\n\nINFO: Has anyone even bothered to ask your niece if she even *cares* if everyone else still go to the park? She might not.", "NTA. Canceling a trip everyone is looking forward to because one girl thinks she's fat? That's crazy. Her mom could take her to do something else that day or, like my family would have done, tell her tough shit, toss her a big t-shirt and head to the Waterpark. She can sit on a beach chair in a fully covering sweat suit if that's what she wants to do but I feel like once she got there she'd see how much fun everyone is having and join in.", "I\u2019m on mobile idk how to quote properly but \n\n\u201cSIL said that she's not going to exclude her daughter from a family outing like that.  She said that's just going to reinforce her body-image issues and show her that we aren't being supportive.\u201d\n\nHow is cancelling the entire outing not also reinforcing her body-image issues? Idk how severe her issues are or what she\u2019s going through but I also had body-image issues growing up and being able to be around my family and people in public settings having fun with all different bodies helped me put it in perspective a bit. We all have \u201cimperfect\u201d bodies but we can enjoy them too. I\u2019d also say NTA btw", "NTA. I do feel for your niece, it's a difficult age and struggling with body image issues is not easy. However, you're offering to refund their full family tickets even though you only get 50% back. It's one day to spend apart so it shouldn't be that big of a deal. Besides, your kids will be bummed and likely talk about it on the trip and would make the niece feel guilty anyway. \n\nSIL could also use this opportunity to find swimsuits your niece would be comfortable with. They make full coverage tops and skirts that she may feel more comfortable in which would be better than letting her think she shouldn't do anything fun if she doesn't like her body.", "NTA.  There are so many wrongs here, but you're not one of them.\r  \n\r  \nLet's start with SIL.  She scheduled and paid for the waterpark. Now she wants to get a refund because one person (her daughter) doesn't want to go? I don't think she's entitled to any refund.  Also what about her son? He doesn't get to go because is sister doesn't want to? He's going to start seeing sister as the golden child whose whims override any plans (assuming that he has not already concluded this due to similar occurrences).\r  \n\r  \nNow your family... Your wife wants to cancel for your family. You're not making her the bad guy; she *is* the bad guy. Now one child's whim is killing the plans of two families. If she has the guts to cancel, definitely let *her* tell your kids that they can't go because their cousin decided not to go.", "NTA. Your SIL and wife are being unreasonable. If SIL doesn\u2019t want her family to go, they do t have to go, but they don\u2019t get to decide your family isn\u2019t going either. You\u2019ve already planned the entire outing and paid money that you cannot get back. You\u2019re wife is TA is she tries to force you into giving up something that was already set in stone when there\u2019s no real reason to. \n\nIf you feel you have to cancel the trip, make sure SIL reimburses YOU for the money you lose, because you\u2019re giving this trip up unwillingly.", "Nta. You are not fatshaming or excluding your niece. She is more than welcome to go. She has excluded herself due To her own insecurities. Also it's not fair to allow 1 person to spoil or veto actovities for everyone else. Plus if all the children to be deprived of a fun summer activity that they are eagerly anticipating because 1 person wants to hijack the vacation and her parents are supporting it its gonna cause major resentment amongst the chumdren. Are you going to deny all the kids ice-cream and burgers since niece is concerned with body image and may refuse to eat anything fattening? If one child gets a stomach ache are u gonna pour pepti down everyones throat.Of course not.\nKeep the passes...not only will you and your kids enjoy them but the niece may change her mind and both families can go. Regardless  the 2 families can enjoy time apart on vacation not every day trip or activity needs yall attached at the hip", "NTA, why can\u2019t your niece dress normal and play on phone or iPad?", "NTA\n\nNope.\n\nBending to the niece on this is sending two messages, first is 'we agree with your body issues, no one wants to see you in a swimsuit' and second is 'you are more important than the group and we will bend to your every whim'. There are only so many activities in the vicinity of the campground. This is the option that was agreed upon and paid for. \n\nIf the niece doesn't want to wear a swimsuit or participate, she shouldn't be forced. She can put on a cute summer dress, bring a book and camp out on a lounge chair. This could actually work really well for securing some chairs together and having a meet up spot should one of the kids need a break for a bit. Maybe eve throw her a few babysitting dollars for helping out.\n\nAdditionally, most of those waterparks have other activities for kids, such as arcades. Bring a deck of cards or a travel checkers board; the adults can take turns spending quality time with her. \n\nThe passes have been paid for and all the kids want to go except the one niece. If SIL really wants to stay behind with the niece, her choice, but everyone else should stick to the plan that was paid for. \n\nDo not let one child arbitrarily dictate the activities of the other children and the adults. Once that pandora's box gets opened, this will look like the tip of the iceberg of nonsense and drama. \n\nHave fun at the waterpark!", "NTA.  If you cancel the Waterpark it will take  5 minutes for the kids to figure out why.  They will decide that they are being punished because their cousin is fat.  After that the whole vacation will be \"We can't go to the Waterpark because you're fat!\" And then they will never stop picking on her.", "NTA, and do NOT cancel the passes. I get it, I was a teen girl once too, and it sucks feeling self conscious about your body, but that does NOT mean everyone else has to suffer. And what about SIL\u2019s son? Does he not get a choice in this? Why does he have to suffer because his sister doesn\u2019t want to go? \n\nPut your foot down on this because this is a family outing and one kid doesn\u2019t get to dictate what everyone does. Making everyone else unhappy is not going to help your niece at all. It could even make her feel worse because all the other kids will be upset with her. Instead you take the kids including your nephew.", "Show your wife this thread. NTA", "SIL is the AH.  And a bully. GO to the waterpark.  Have fun.  SIL & her daughter can fend for themselves for one day.  The world doesnt stop because someone is chubby.  As a middle aged woman I felt WAY better about my body after I got to the waterpark & saw all the other real humans with imperfect bodies just having fun & not giving a crap", "NTA. Your kids shouldn't be made to suffer because of cousin's issue. I'm glad they aren't making her go but she needs to learn that her issues aren't everyone's issue. And it's pretty crappy of your wife to want you to share responsibility for her decision with the kids.", "NTA. I hope you don\u2019t take this outing away from your kids. I was the fat kid/teenager. I had (have) massive body image issues. If I was invited to a water park, I\u2019d find a swimsuit I was mildly comfortable in. Life\u2019s to short to give up on fun because of these issues.", "NTA - if you're a team then you both would be in agreement. You're not agreeing to canceling plans. She's doing it unilaterally. She can deal with those consequences. That's called being a parent. Maybe SIL could try it.", "NTA. You do what you want with your family. Don\u2019t let your niece hold you all hostage. Your wife can skip too if she wants.", "NTA. A family vacation is about Everyone going, not the individual. \n\nNaturally everyone is allowed to say \u2018no thanks\u2019 to outings and activities and have that respected, but they do Not get to dictate what everyone else does.", "I was fat in water parks as a kid. If anything, avoiding these scenarios and having adults essentially *agree* that she shouldn\u2019t wear a swim suit in public is damaging. Your sil should hype her up and buy her a cute suit, and tell her to enjoy the water park, others\u2019 opinions be damned.", "NTA-  You suggested an activity and they agreed.  Tickets were purchased before they changed their minds.  \n\nGo enjoy the water on memorial day.\n\nTry and move the conversation past this one weekend - \u201c ok this weekend didn\u2019t work out best for niece.  It is too difficult to change that. We\u2019ll know to be more careful in the future.\n\nWhat else can we do to support her this summer.?\u201d", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nOmg the sensitivity is insane. Your initial plan of keeping the passes but refunding two for SIL and niece was completely rational. Let\u2019s say you spent $400- the park is only going to give you $200 back. That\u2019s only going to be $100 back to each family anyway, because it wouldn\u2019t be fair for SIL to get 100 percent of her money back and you take a complete loss of money and no tickets. \n   Niece doesn\u2019t want to go to the park, fine, have a mother daughter day exploring the town and clothes shopping or spa day. Do things to increase her self esteem and have quality time instead of projecting false fears and rules onto her and for the whole family to follow. If the niece didn\u2019t like chocolate, does that mean you\u2019re not allowed to eat thin mints? \n   Wife and SIL owe you and the family a huge apology for the nasty words and criticisms they said to you. Telling you you\u2019re not a good uncle and fat shaming bc you don\u2019t want to be out a family purchase? Puh-lease.", "Tell your wife you are taking the kids, with or without her.

Once I realized I actually could find swimwear that had more coverage and didn\u2019t look dated or frumpy I started feeling a lot more confident. There\u2019s lots of online stores that sell swimwear that is cute and flattering for all body shapes. I\u2019m guessing niece would actually enjoy the water park as long as she was wearing something she felt comfortable in.
