Anyways I (17M) came home from school the other day to my sisters Chris(27F) and Ana(19F) sitting on the couch talking to each other. So like any other day I walk past them, When the older one Chris stops me and says \u201chey I hope you don\u2019t have plans for the 10th\u201d. I respond why? Then she continues I need you to record an event for me. For context the 10th is me and my girlfriends anniversary. So I say I can\u2019t I\u2019m busy all that day. because we normally spend the whole day with each other But she cuts me off and says \u201cNo you\u2019re not\u201d and I say back yes I am and we go back and forth a couple times. Then she finally asks \u201cwhat are you busy with\u201d and I say \u201cit\u2019s mine and my girlfriend\u2019s anniversary\u201d *She pauses and says \u201cso your really going to gyp me out of this because of nothing\u201d. Which in my head translated to your relationship goals are meaningless and I take priority (sorry if that doesn\u2019t make sense) so I snapped on her and asked if she was delusional. there was an awkward silence for about 5 minutes but when I was in my room I could hear her talking bad about me to my other sister saying things like \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t talk to me like that\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s to young to be saying the things he does\u201d.Reddit I keep on thinking about this and I keep on going either way in my head. This isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done things like this but this is the first time I ever \u201ctalked back\u201d to her but her reaction to it I feel wasn\u2019t okay. And if you need extra info on the way she\u2019s reacted in the past to minor things I\u2019ll provide it.
