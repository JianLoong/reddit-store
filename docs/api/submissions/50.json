I'm biologically a woman and that's really disgusting, specifically the period stuff.", "NTA- That's not misogyny, she's disgusting and this is coming from a woman. Tell your parents ASAP and show them the proof.", "NTA.\n\nIf her dad won't tell her that she's required to clean up and shower up, then her dad needs to not have her over until she respects herself and the household enough to not be a pig. \nYour mom should put her foot down about it.\n\nEntire households don't get to be held hostage by one inconsiderate AH like your step-sister. It's your mom's job to inform her husband that his child will be required to perform a minimum standard of personal hygiene and cleaning up the bathroom every time she's done using it. If not, the consequence is that she's unwelcome in the home.\n\nI know that's extremely harsh, but dad's are wimps when it comes to their girl's periods and making them do yucky things like cleaning up. Unless his wife insists, he's not gonna do shit about it.\n\nYou deserve a clean environment. I hope your mom makes that happen for you.", "NTA. What you\u2019ve described isn\u2019t just a hygiene or courtesy issue, though it\u2019s both of those, it\u2019s also a health concern. You shouldn\u2019t have to dodge, touch or clean up her blood to use the bathroom. This is a safety issue, and somebody in the household needs to deal with her. If she can\u2019t get it together, then you need to have access to a different bathroom.", "NTA, use a shovel or broom and move it all the the hall in front of her door, trashcan too.   Unfortunately, you will have to clean up the blood.   I would take pictures and send to her dad too.   That's disgusting.   If it doesn't change, move with your dad FT if he will let you.", "NTA not only is it disgusting, it\u2019s unhealthy and unhygienic for everyone else who uses that bathroom. She\u2019s potentially risking exposing people to blood born illness from not cleaning up her blood spots and letting the exposed soiled pads become airborne pathogens.  \n\nPersonally, I think you\u2019re on the right track to get your step dad involved. Maybe talk to your other siblings and have a family meeting with your stepdad and mom about it so they know everyone has an issue with her unhygienic behavior and attitude. \n\nYou all have a right to a safe and healthy environment. They\u2019re not providing it, if they allow her to continue that behavior.\n\nAlso, that girl needs some serious therapy. How low does one\u2019s self respect and self esteem have to be to have no desire to take care of her own hygiene and to leave a bloody smelly mess all over the place for everyone else to clean up after her. As a woman I\u2019m appalled. At 16, I\u2019d have been mortified to know my stepbrother was aware of my period and cleaning up after me or yelling at me because of my lack of proper care.", "NTA - Time to start missing with your aim.", "NTA. This is feral. You\u2019ve brought the issue to her attention and she\u2019s ignored you. \n\nCall me an AH but I\u2019d take photos, put it in PowerPoint and sit the whole family down for a slideshow.", "NTA. Address this immediately. Especially with the period, that can be dangerous. Viruses and pathogens can be present in menstrual blood.", "NTA. She is disgusting. I don't care what the \"rules\" are, if I had a stepdaughter who acted like this, I'd tell her to change her ways or she would be banned from the house. That's just nonsense.", "NTA. That's disgusting. Start taking pictures of her mess and sending them to everyone in your family. Every single time. Or you could just post them.", "NTA I'd refuse to stay there that'd gross", "NTA start pissing on the board of the toilet seat pooping on the floor", "NTA\n\nThat's just gross\n\nMaybe talk it over with your parents and if nothing comes from it then it's time to take actions into your own hands and address the issue directly (or start fighting fire with fire, get so messy yourself that your parents have no choice but to make a new rule for the entire family to clean up after themselves)", "NTA -- leave the towels and trash can in the parents bathroom", "NTA. I can see how this must frustrate you beyond belief and you shouldn\u2019t just sit back and say nothing. How would she like it if you just started pissing all over the toilet and bathroom and then didn\u2019t clean it up? It\u2019s natural that a mess may happen every now and then with a woman on her period but she should also be capable of cleaning up after herself. She\u2019s 16 not 10. \n\nAll the other things you\u2019ve named that she does are just unacceptable that nobody should have to live with and she won\u2019t make it very far in life if she doesn\u2019t learn that soon. Her parents really did mess up by not teaching her these things aren\u2019t okay.", "NTA. I\u2019m a girl and I found this disgusting. I would feel feel so embarrassed if I left blood on the floor.", "INFO: \nWhy have you not brought this up with your parents much much sooner???", "Could you just say nothing, take pictures and use the parents bathroom? Leave her trash there for her parent to see, and if they complain that you are not using your assigned bathroom, show them why.", "First, NTA, but maybe could be a bit more diplomatic about it. Second, maybe this is something that is from being neurodivergent. Even something as mundane as depression/ADHD can cause a lack of care for oneself. Maybe gently talk to both your mom and stepdad and your step sister about her mental state. Is she ok? Is she depressed? Maybe therapy would be good. There could be something going on other than being lazy or gross. Just my two cents on it.", "NTA for finding her behaviour disgusting and unacceptable - I (F50s) would too - but an A for how you're expressing it. Shouting won't solve anything. Talk to your mother and SF and get them to sort it.", "NTA but what are you waiting for? TALK TO YOUR FAMILY / STEPDAD", "NTA \n\nThat is unsanitary and disgusting. Is that the only bathroom? Demand she start using your parents bathroom or you will if she doesn\u2019t start cleaning the bathroom properly. \n\nA little public shaming at school may help also.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We both have divorced parents. I stay with my mom and stepdad on Mondays-Thursdays and I stay with my dad Fridays-Sundays. Unless it\u2019s holiday or summer when I don\u2019t have school. She stays with her dad every other week. My sister, other stepsisters, and half sister have good hygiene so this is not just me holding a grudge against her.\n\nShe has a heavy period and gets blood everywhere in the bathroom. There have been splotches of blood on the floor, on the toilet, in the shower, and even some on the cabinet. She doesn\u2019t clean any of it up. We have 2 trash cans in the bathroom yet once, she left one on the floor. She also leaves the wrappers in the sink sometimes. Most of the time, she doesn\u2019t wrap her used pads in toilet paper and I end up seeing them sticking out of the trash can. The bathroom often smells so horrible too because she won\u2019t use an air freshener or perfume, which we have plenty of in the bathroom. \n\nIt even goes beyond her period. She won\u2019t pick up her clothes, dirty towels, dirty washcloths, etc out of the bathroom. Just like I said before, that leaves either me to pick it up or my mom to tell her to. Which is unacceptable. Last week, she left a soap bar in the drain and sometimes she doesn\u2019t flush the toilet. Also,\nSHE DOESNT BRUSH HER TEETH OFTEN\nSHE DOESNT WEAR DEODORANT\nI\u2019ve seen her use a shirt as a tissue once too. She irritates me with all of this. \n\nMy mom and stepdad have a \u201crule\u201d that only the parent can demand their child do something. If my stepsister was my mom\u2019s child, my Italian mom definitely wouldn\u2019t take any of this\n\nLast night, I decided it was finally time I spoke up and told my stepsister the truth.\nI told her she needed to clean up after herself, stop getting blood everywhere, wrap the pads up in toilet paper, spray the bathroom with fragrance when it smells, and do better with her hygiene overall. She said I\u2019m a man so I can\u2019t tell a woman what to do and that she\u2019ll continue to do it. I told her that I would appreciate if she started to clean up because I use the bathroom too, especially because I have sports and I shower every night. She started arguing with me and I had no choice but to argue back. We screamed at each other until my mom asked why and I told her exactly. My mom said she was going to bring this up with my stepdad but she also suggested that my stepsister be more hygienic. \n\nSo today I saw the 2 dirty towels piled on the floor, the used pads unwrapped in the trash can, and a speck of blood on the toilet. Also, I smelt metal, which was the blood. I went to find her in her room and I screamed at her that I\u2019ve had enough. She said the same argument as before.\nI\u2019m at the point where I want to tell my stepdad if my mom hasn\u2019t already. My stepsister is just going to bring up the same arguments and we\u2019re just going to scream at each other more.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. I am a woman and indeed it sometimes happen that a bit of blood gets on the floor, seat, etc, but it is obvious to clean up after oneself. Also to wrap pads to avoid the smell and be discreet. You are completely reasonable and this has nothing to do with being a man or woman, but just of being clean and not wanting to live like in a pig pen. Maybe ask her how she would feel if you left pee on the seat and she had to sit in it.", "Tell your parents you refuse to share a bathroom with her until she stops her piggish ways so from now on you will use their bathroom. If they don't like that, refuse to stay there any longer or ask her dad to clean up after her while she is there. Orvshe stays away until she learns how to act in polite society. \n\nIf her father says that is how women are,  he needs to meet more women. Show him these comments!!! Then again if her mother is like that (she learned it somewhere) that may be his only experience which is truly gross. Imagine what the bathroom at her mom's house is like?  Ick.  \n\nGood luck OP.  you are NTA and deserve a sanitary bathroom to use.", "NTA.  Imagine a brother leaving his jizz around the bathroom for his sister to step in/deal with and being like \"you're not a man, you can't tell me what to do!\".\n\nThis is gross and a health issue,   I'm a woman, it's not hard to clean up after yourself and dispose of your products properly.", "NTA. Woman or man. Period or not. That's a disgusting human being", "We had to talk with my 13 year old about filling up her bathroom trash can with her period products without emptying it out. This is just vile. It\u2019s not that hard to wipe up the toilet when you drip. And how in the hell is she dropping on the floor and in the shower? Just free bleeding? I am 40 and never got blood on the floor. You stand up from the toilet and are either wearing a tampon or you have pulled up your underwear with a pad on it.", "Id start texting photos of this in the family group chat and make sure her dad sees it every time she does this. NTA", "If it were me, I would pile all of her detritus into a trash bag and dump it out in her room. Or maybe in father's room. But that's the nuclear option so maybe don't listen to me.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Blood is a biohazard, technically, and can carry diseases. This is not misogyny, this is being a responsible roommate. \nTalk to your mom about this. Be honest with your reasons for coming to her. Get proof if need be. Maybe also bring your stepdad into this conversation. Stress the mess and smell rather than it being period blood. \nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to ask for a roommate to use some method to keep the bathroom smelling nice. The personal stuff (teeth and deodorant) you might have less of a ground to stand on, and the pads being wrapped in toilet paper might be a battle you have to concede (maybe get a covered trash can to help with any smell), but it\u2019s entirely reasonable to ask that anyone you live with keep the bathroom clean and smelling somewhat decent.", "I'm a woman with a brother, and we shared a bathroom in our youth. I am ashamed to say it took me a lot longer than it should have to remember to get into the habit of wrapping pads and properly disposing of them. So as someone who was like your stepsister, NTA.\n\nPart of existing in a shared space means cleaning up after yourself. Further, if she was using the bathroom at school, would she leave her used period on the sink? Does she just trash the bathroom at her friends houses? No? Then she knows how to do things properly and she needs to treat you with the same respect she gives everyone else she is in contact with.", "Sounds like she has a mental health issue, in addition to poor hygiene. Her behavior is not normal.", "If I were your mother,  I'd take pictures of the mess.  If that wasn't enough to convince my husband to address the issue, I'd switch it up so my son and I shared a bathroom and my husband could share with his daughter.   I suspect that would be effective motivation. \n\nNTA.", "YTA, this isn't your battle to fight. if only her dad can tell her what to do then talk to her dad. You taking matters in your own hand is just causing arguments.", "ESH Everything you said is reasonable, everything you want is reasonable, but when you walk to her room and started screaming at her, that wasn't. I understand the emotions can get heated, so when you were arguing and both of you got upset that was understandable, but after that you had the time to think about what you were going to do, and you chose to walk down the hall and start yelling.", "Is it possible that she is autistic, has ADHD, depression or psychological trauma or something?  This is not really normal behavior for someone her age.", "Do y\u2019all go to the same school? Let her know about her bad hygiene in front of her friends and school friends.. that might get her going!!!", "I second this! And I'm a woman as well\n\nEDIT: I'm so angry I literally forgot ot add my judgement: NTA", "Actually it should be deposited on her bed each and every time.", "label it \"the slideshow that nobody wants to really see\"", "Doubt she'd care.", "This was what I was thinking also", "[deleted]", "THIS!", "are you the sister?!? like thats gross AF. yes. he should be dealing with this because he is the one who has to constantly clean up after her. matter of fact OP when he gets home invite him upstairs and make him clean it up for his daughter and see if he wants to talk to her then.", "If he shares a bathroom with her and has to clean up her period blood how TF is it not his battle to fight?\n\nAnd how is he TA? Someone has to say something to her and her dad thinks its fine.", "That was my first thought. Lol", "Start pissing in the floor around the toilet and say \"its a guy thing\" and \"your a woman u can't tell me how to handle my gentiles same as I can't tell u how to handle yours. Is this the game u wanna play? Cause if not we can both agree to clean up after ourselves properly, you know like cleaning our own bodily fluids? Could u actually commit to that or do u want piss soaked towles because u keep leaving them in the floor?\"\n\nIf ur step-dad gets mad tell him to take it up with your mom cause he's not allowed to parent or set rules for u, id add in a \"maybe if u parented your daughter the first time this was an issue it wouldn't have escalated\"", "Fine. He can share the bathroom with her.", "Then maybe the stepdad needs to be cleaning up after her. She is 16, she knows the drill, what you\u2019re asking for is the bare minimum.  Is there another bathroom she can use perhaps one she and stepdad can share so they he can see how bad it is? NTA"]}
