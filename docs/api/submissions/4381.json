He was in special education and struggling when I met him, but he's now an honor student and functions mostly as a normal teenager.  \n\nMy husband was laid off from the oilfield job in early 2020 and regressed to his former life of drugs and drinking, the way he lived before I came along. I got a glimpse of what he was like, after the death of my father. He became very vicious, cruel, and I no longer trust him. My adult child will no longer allow my grandkids around him and rightfully so. \n\nHe has always shifted all adult responsibilities to me, with the excuse he provides an income.

She was moved from the hospital to a skilled nursing facility,  but husband expects me to bring her home and care for her. She does too. She has diabetes and a multitude of health problems I am not equipped to deal with. Plus, my health began to decline quickly after marriage.  I have severe arthritis and torn cartlige in both knees and referred for replacement.  I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer also. My Healthcare is on hold due to his constant job hopping and waiting to be eligible for insurance,  along with his demands I stay home, cook 3 meals a day, caretake and serve. I have been contemplating going back in the workforce despite my health so I can depend on myself again and hopefully regain my life. I can't do this if I'm taking care of his mother.

NTA, but damn. If a spouse \u201ctold me\u201d I was to now quit my job, that would\u2019ve been it. The story would\u2019ve ended there. \n\nOP, pack a bag, fill the tank, and leave no forwarding address. Why are you fighting so hard to cling to every imaginable source of misery in your life?", "NTA.  You\u2019ve already tolerated far more from this man than I would have.  Seek happiness, and leave this demanding, ungrateful, unkind mess of a man behind.", "NTA Get out of their while you can. Do you feel safe enough to ask for a divorce. Because this is an abusive situation. You have kept your husband afloat for too long.", "NTA\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and leave him.  You need to put your needs ahead of your husband, his child, and his mother.  \n\nTalk to your family and ask if you can stay with them for a while while you take care of your needs.", "This post is absolutely sending me over the edge. You have cancer among other health problems and he expects you to take care of his dying mother round the clock while he sits on his ass drinking and doing drugs? While you cook and take care of the household and everyone in it?\n\nNo no no please get a job because you'll be able to get insurance to deal with your own medical problems with a steady job. NTA 1000%!", "NTA.  You are looking out for survival for yourself!  You husband and his family see you as a servant and you deserve better.\n\nYou are obviously in a terrible situation.  Is there a women's shelter nearby?  That may sound drastic, but when you land a job your husband sounds like he will go ballistic.  Check out your options and like you said, regain your independence.", "NTA \n\nThese issues seem to be his to fix, not yours.  What you've done is admirable but as he is now unemployed I see no reason why he can't pick up the slack.  You've made sacrifices and now it's his turn.  If drugs and alcohol are in the way of that... sounds like his problem.  \n\nHonestly I'd give some thought to leaving him.  You're married to a man choosing drugs and booze over his family.  What a catch.", "NTA. It sounds like your relationship has had elements of domestic violence and that your husband's been super controlling. Great work getting his son to a position of thriving, that's incredible of you. \n\nBy all means please take back the reins on your life and reenter the workforce, get your health taken care of, and DO NOT participate in caring for your MIL AT ALL.", "This sounds like financial abuse. He makes you quit your job, and when you have no income, he's terrible to you, and excuses his behavior by saying he's the one who pays for everything.  Essentially telling you \"You have no choice\".\n\nHe does not care that you have cancer. He cares that you will be there to do everything so that he can sink deeper into his addiction.  He doesn't have to take care of his kid, or his mom, or anything - he'll just make YOU do it.\n\nPlease gather your ID, bank statements, etc. quietly and start making an escape plan.", "Nta\n\nGo for it, do whatever makes you happy. If he wants someone to look after his mother then he can do it.", "NTA.   In no way cave to this and care for her.  It\u2019s not your function as his wife to care for his family.  He\u2019s not working, he can move her in and you can move out if it comes to that.", "NTA. This is way more than you signed up for.  You should have an adult conversation with the rest of his family about who takes care of whom. And if they're not willing to help, you should consider getting a divorce.", "NTA. but seriously. Yikes. I\u2019d immediately divorce him and get as far away as possible and focus on my own health and happiness for what sounds like the first time in your life.", "NTA \n\nIt's okay to live your life for you and take care of yourself and your needs.\n\nYou don't have to sacrifice yourself, your well-being and your dreams any longer.", "NTA run as fast as you can and take care of your health!", "Oh honey. Could you possibly separate from him so you can have some peace, get a job, and treat your own cancer? You need someone to take care of you right now not the other way around. Im not sure what the best path forward is but it definitely isn\u2019t caring for you drug addicted, dead beat, leaching husband\u2019s mother. NTA I wish you the best. Try applying for Medicaid.", "NTA How can you possibly care for anyone one else if you are not taking care of yourself. Been there done that, look out for yourself first. I truly wish you all the best.", "You said two things that stood out to me:\n\n\u201cMy husband informed me I would now be a full time mom and I had to quit by job\u201d\n\n\u201cI was happily providing my own income and living independently before I met him and it was his choice to change this\u201c\n\nYou place all the blame on him, and although your husband seems to be a controlling, selfish AH, these were also your choices because you didn\u2019t say no, or choose what you wanted. You\u2019re NTA for finally doing what you want and what\u2019s best for you. Do not concede your own happiness to cling to a man that\u2019s clearly done everything to put his own wants and desires ahead of yours.", "His mother was sent to a skilled nursing facility,  because she needs SKILLED NURSING care around the clock.
