It's basic.\n\nSide note thought, it's painfully ridiculous for any company to test for THC. I know it's in healthcare, but that's not an excuse for dumb policies. That *does not excuse your partner's failure*.", "NTA,\n\nHe should be careful about your warning instead of acting like a kid and denying it", "NTA - he is a grown man. At some point for most people who smoke, you have to choose if u wanna smoke weed or get paid. He chose poorly.", "NTA. He was well aware of the potential consequences in his line of work. I don't agree with those, and think that sucks, but they're a fact of life if you work certain jobs and I would also have limited sympathy for someone who knew that and just decided to gamble they wouldn't be tested.", "NTA. Also this situation will let you see how he handles life and if you want to be with a boy or a man.", "NTA.  You made him aware and he ignored it.  A lot of fields still follow federal rules and marijuana is still illegal on that level.", "NTA tbh. I think he's just upset about the situation overall and is lashing out at you unfairly.", "NTA. He made a choice to do something he knew could get him in trouble. You warned him when he took the job. He has no reason to be mad at you.", "NTA. what were you supposed to do? swap pee tests with him? and it was random! so it wasnt as if you could predict when this was coming.", "NTA He is a grown ass man responsible for his irresponsible behavior.  No sympathy especially since he is mad ay you and not himself.", "NTA he is a grown ass man like you said and it's not your fault this is blowing up in his face.", "NTA; your partner is a 28 year old man and knew the risks of doing substances in that field. My dad flunked out of nursing school for this reason, that was all on him.", "NTA, he's an adult. Time to understand adult choices and consequences. At 28, he should know these things. Perhaps a very serious evaluation of his maturity level and life goals are in order to determine if this is someone whom you wish to coexist with.", "NTA I feel like we are missing context. Is he addicted? \nIt is not your fault. He risked it and got caught. If you aren\u2019t mocking him, there is no reason to be mad at you. It is not your job to be empathetic for his behaviour if he knew the risks, if he is not an addict.", "NTA... you warned him. This is a FAFO moment and it's all his problem.  He's mad that you were right and his choices have consequences he didn't care to listen to.", "NTA. \n\nHe fucked around and he found out.\n\nThis whole debate is so absurd to me. Yeah, okay, you think THC/wacky grass shouldn't be illegal/forbidden. But in a lot of places,  it is. I personally think it shouldn't be illegal for me to go to the car lot and drive away with a brand new BMW X5, because I want one.

You didn\u2019t make the rule, or make him go into the field. And you warned him. Some jobs test, and he should have known better.", "NTA.  His anger seems misdirected.", "Absolutely NTA.  It\u2019s his problem, not yours.", "THC should be tested because unfortunately people are using it at very large doses which does impede function. It has also been shown to cause delays in executive functioning and hand and eye coordination. (Again context matters, myself as a family physican less concerning but a surgeon that would make me leery).", "I think it\u2019s dumb to test for THC but sadly it\u2019s just part of the system and you have to play the part if you want the job. I tried being sympathetic to at least that portion of it.", "THIS RIGHT HERE. I also agree that its high time employers stop testing for pot. I mean I've seen people show up completely drunk and that apparently is ok. But despite that, those are the current policies and OP had WARNED him about them. He chose to ignore her warnings and then got in toruble. And she's expected to feel bad?

Not by THC, not by opiates, not by ethanol, not by\u2026.\n\nThe difficulty is that a positive result for THC can be way way after any potential period of impairment has ended.", "What's the good reason? Even OP agrees it's an archaic rule.", "You've seen drunk people show up for jobs in health care and it's considered okay??", "Perhaps not a severe addict OP but the \"hard time stepping away\" could be an indication of it turning into that direction especially if he was unable to hold off knowing a drug test was coming up", "\n>I tried to be helpful up until he accused me of having no empathy for his situation\n\nHe doesnt deserve empathy.

But you\u2019re not the one who fired him. His job did. Because of his choice to smoke. THC is perfectly harmless and I welcome the day it\u2019s legal, but if you take a job that tests for it you need to be prepared for the consequences of your actions.", "NTA It is a concern that he is mad at you and not taking responsibility for his own actions. People who blame others and get mad at others for their own decisions, especially when they were warned of the consequences, rarely make good partners. Strike that, they NEVER make good partners because they never grow and learn.", "NTA, you tried to warn him and he didn\u2019t listen. Not your fault at all.", "Funny thing is he knew the rules.

Fully developed brain and grown enough to take responsibility for himself. Obviously you are an adult as well at 22, and the age gap isn't weird or anything, but at 22 years old you aren't responsible for the actions of an almost 30yo in any way, shape, or form. Technically, your brain is not fully developed until 25 and yet, here you are being more responsible and mindful of how your actions will affect your career. NTA, but consider this a red flag.", "NTA I do aggree that it's stupid to check for weed, since it stays for weeks or months, so someone could just do it on the weekend and be perfectly fine at work ( no different then alcool).\nBut you warned him and he's the one who made the decisions. Not your fault at all and yeah, i also wouldn't have too much sympathy for his case.", "NTA. He wants sympathy for being a dumba\\*\\*, when he knew he was being a dumba\\*\\*, but figured he was special enough not to get tested, and if tested, not get caught after imbibing, and if caught as positive, to be excused.  See the logic in that?  You are right - there is none.  He is old enough to accept the consequences for his own wilful behaviour.\n\nHe would likely interpret you sympathizing with him as tacit agreement he is right and the rules are wrong.", "Nta why is he mad at you???

That's wild! \n\nAlso NTA", "Of course he does, but I find it odd to show no empathy here. If I was in this situation I'd be frustrated they didnt listen to me but id also feel bad for my partner because I love them and I want them to be happy and successful no matter what. I would try and be comforting while helping to figure what to do about the failed test. OP is not an asshole but I'd argue they are not being a good partner. (If they weren't being at least a bit emphatic, which we dont know because they only say they were accused of not being)", "NTA but I disagree with your point if the person is doing direct patient care. THC along with ETOH can severely impair judgment and response times and should not be used if there is a possibility it could affect your job.", "It's not dumb. I would NOT like to be treated by a doctor who's high. I have the right to know whether the professional i'm talking to is under the influence of any substance, and it could also be a huge liability for the hospital.", "then you're definitely an asshole, no questions asked lol", "Then that would just make you an asshole stoking your own ego.", "Did you seriously just compare stealing a car to smoking a bowl?  Just wow.", "Dude's just lashing out because he can't bear to admit that he did something wrong. She was even being *nice* about it. If I had warned my partner that strenuously about the consequences of doing something like that and they decided to do it anyway and then *blamed me* afterwards, one of us would be sleeping elsewhere until we could sit down and have a talk about their risk assessment.", "Racism and getting rid of \"undesirables\" is why the drug war was created.  \n\nA doctor shouldn't be smoking blunts between patients but if they want to do it when they get home then there's on harm done.", "Not legal here no.", "I gave them time to be upset and also attempted to find solutions. They lashed out I wasn\u2019t upset enough. I didn\u2019t include too much detail because it didn\u2019t seem necessary but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not the end of the world for them that they are losing their job over this.", " NTA-He's a 28yo man, she is his girlfriend, not his mother.  They are supposed to be a partners in the relationship and he wasn't being a very good partner by behaving in a way that put his job in jeopardy.

I only ask bc my last drug test they basically ignored the thc bc it\u2019s legal in my state (but granted it wasn\u2019t like a government job or anything fancy)\nEdit: NTA he knew what would happen. It sucks tho. And I hope he finds a better opportunity that doesn\u2019t drug test", "Agreed, but the problem os that THC stays in your system for a much longer time, so you can test positive at work for having smoked on your weekend off and been perfectly sober at work. \n\nNo professional should ever be impaired at work! But it would be nice to have a better test so people could relax in their free time in places where it is legal.", "But that\u2019s different. You wouldn\u2019t like a drunk doctor either but if they drink alcohol off duty you wouldn\u2019t expect them to be fired.", "That is not what the test determines??? THC used recreationally stays in your system even if you haven't used it for hours. It's like saying you don't want to be treated by someone who had a couple of drinks the night before", "You've seen people drunk and work and didn't do anything to stop that from occuring?", "That sounds like an addict. Why are you with them?", "Only to illustrate how ridiculous it is think that you shouldn't have to follow rules or laws because you think they're stupid.", "Honestly, this comparison isn't that far off. I smoke weed, love weed. But OP's partner is in healthcare. It's no mystery that weed can most certainly cause brain fog, level depending on how often you use it. If you are notified by both your place of work and partner who has been in the industry for 4 years that it is NOT allowed because mistakes in healthcare can have dire consequences, you should not be Pikachu shocked face when you specifically do not listen/follow rules. Inserting an IV or drawing blood is pretty routine procedure. If you smoke a little too much the night before and wake up super groggy, then proceed to cause nerve damage by doing the procedure incorrectly that's a consequence someone else faces because you couldn't follow the rules of the field.", "Exactly. THC testing is archaic and also rather pointless in terms of safety concerns because of the length of time it's detectable in your system ... but those are the terms of the job in some fields. If cannabis is THAT important to you, then you need to pick a different job.", "You just displayed some serious ignorance. A healthcare professional can be stone cold sober during their work day but then smoke at night and it would be in their system for at least a month. So what, your healthcare professional isn\u2019t allowed to recreationally use substances off the clock on their own time? That\u2019s such crap.", "Oh ok. That makes more sense then.", "He was clean when he tested for the job months ago. Had another test this past week and failed.", "Exactly. THC lasts longer in your system which means it's effects on your brain last even hours after you smoked. [THC can affect concentration, among other things. This effect can last for 24 hours or more after consuming it.](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/marijuana-use-and-its-effects)\n\nLike i said, i don't want to be treated by someone who's under the effect of any substance, be it alcohol, drugs or anything else. It's not comparable with having a drink the day before because the effects of alcohol don't last as long.", "I know of someone who was fired for coming to work to pop in and say hi, wasn't on the clock hadn't been on the clock, nothing. Winked at a worker and made a joke about beer in her tumbler. Didn't seem drunk, no smell. Just a joke. \n\nFired. \n\nThe person she made the joke did not turn her in. Someone else near by heard her and turned her in. The person had to be called in and told them she didn't think it was beer, took it as a joke, and she wasn't even on the clock. Didn't matter. \n\nSo what kind of healthecare company just let's drunk people work with no issue? \n\nI will say this hospital also tests for nicotine and will fire you for it (or so I have heard, I do know they test for it) Which is incredibly stupid.", "Not the person you're responding to, but I used to work in hospital food service. We fed patients and followed their diets.\n\nThere was a guy who would a lot of times show up super drunk. One time he laid down on the middle of the kitchen floor for almost his entire shift. He wasn't fired for the longest time because our manager liked having another guy to buddy around with and because his aunt was a nurse. We all complained about him but nothing ever happened. Eventually he did get fired for something unrelated (he was late/no show too many times and the manager couldn't pull strings for him with HR, though he tried.)\n\nThat place was a shit show for many reasons including that, and I'm so glad I don't work there anymore.", "Thats like calling somebody an alcoholic cause they have a few beers after work .", "The entire purpose of my second paragraph was to point out that very problem!", "Info: why is he mad at YOU when he failed the test?", "Thc be detected in urine much longer than a day or 2. Remember that they are testing for a metabolite that your body produces after thc has been processed, not thc itself. So you can test positive for weeks after use, even though cognitively you have been fine since the day after use. Thc is fat soluble so the more fat you have on your body the longer it can take to go away. That doesn't mean it's active in your bloodstream though. I understand your concern, just not quite so cut and dry like you think. Failing a drug test for thc does not equal impairment.", "Did you just quote webmd at me lmao", "There are lots of prescription and over the counter medications that can impair you. Sudafed or Benadryl or any opioid painkiller, do you require every medical professional you come into contact with to make sure they have none of that in their system. I would personally prefer to be treated by someone who smoked a joint the night before than someone who just popped a prescription hydrocodone but somehow one is acceptable and the other isn't to you.", "Guess any doctor or nurse taking an SSRI or benzodiazepines for mental illness can\u2019t be trusted. Those are mind altering. \n\nGuess anyone with ADHD taking adderal can\u2019t be trusted, because it\u2019s mind altering and \u201ckinda technically meth\u201d", "And people also love to do that lmao its ridiculous but some can't help themself and always scream addiction whenever they see the word alcohol or drugs no matter the situation\n\nI mean someone drinks or smokes at a party?! Time for some rehab!", "He said he\u2019s mad at me for not being empathetic but I feel it\u2019s displaced anger.", "Whats the issue? It's a known fact that the effects of thc last a long time and may cause damage to cognitive function.

All i know is i don't want to be treated by a doctor who is high or on any substances that may impair their ability to correctly treat me. That seems perfectly reasonable to me and that's why i believe drug test should be enforced.", "Not at all what i'm saying. I'm talking about the EFFECT the drug has and how thay can impair their ability. For people with ADHD adderal is beneficial as it helps them focus. For people with mental ilness their drugs are also beneficial and most likely helps them do their job effectively, so its not a problem. THC has the opposire effect, at least on people who don't need it for therapeutic reasons.", "you are right. it IS displaced anger. \n\nmore than that. you warned him. he did it anyway. you dont realy owe him empathy here anyway.  is it nice? sure. but its not necisary.   hes just mad at himself and mad about geting busted but dousnt want to deal with that when its easyer to be mad at you. \n\nNTA.\n\ni failed a test working with kids. i didnt blame my partner. and it largly was his fault because i WASNT doing drugs at the time. i ate  a cookie by mistake and didnt know it was a greenbatch. that was years ago. it wasnt his fault i was drug tested. it wasnt his fault that i crumbled it on icecream and didnt taste it was green. it was my fault. \n\nits not your fault he was tested. its not your fault he did some drugs. \n\nhe can take his anger elsewhere."]}
