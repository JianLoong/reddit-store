A lot of fields still follow federal rules and marijuana is still illegal on that level.", "NTA tbh. I think he's just upset about the situation overall and is lashing out at you unfairly.", "NTA. He made a choice to do something he knew could get him in trouble. You warned him when he took the job.

My dad flunked out of nursing school for this reason, that was all on him.", "NTA, he's an adult. Time to understand adult choices and consequences. At 28, he should know these things.

Is he addicted? \nIt is not your fault. He risked it and got caught. If you aren\u2019t mocking him, there is no reason to be mad at you.

He's mad that you were right and his choices have consequences he didn't care to listen to.", "NTA. \n\nHe fucked around and he found out.\n\nThis whole debate is so absurd to me. Yeah, okay, you think THC/wacky grass shouldn't be illegal/forbidden. But in a lot of places,  it is.

He wants sympathy for being a dumba\\*\\*, when he knew he was being a dumba\\*\\*, but figured he was special enough not to get tested, and if tested, not get caught after imbibing, and if caught as positive, to be excused.

It sucks tho. And I hope he finds a better opportunity that doesn\u2019t drug test", "Agreed, but the problem os that THC stays in your system for a much longer time, so you can test positive at work for having smoked on your weekend off and been perfectly sober at work. \n\nNo professional should ever be impaired at work! But it would be nice to have a better test so people could relax in their free time in places where it is legal.", "But that\u2019s different. You wouldn\u2019t like a drunk doctor either but if they drink alcohol off duty you wouldn\u2019t expect them to be fired.", "That is not what the test determines??? THC used recreationally stays in your system even if you haven't used it for hours. It's like saying you don't want to be treated by someone who had a couple of drinks the night before", "You've seen people drunk and work and didn't do anything to stop that from occuring?", "That sounds like an addict. Why are you with them?", "Only to illustrate how ridiculous it is think that you shouldn't have to follow rules or laws because you think they're stupid.", "Honestly, this comparison isn't that far off. I smoke weed, love weed. But OP's partner is in healthcare. It's no mystery that weed can most certainly cause brain fog, level depending on how often you use it. If you are notified by both your place of work and partner who has been in the industry for 4 years that it is NOT allowed because mistakes in healthcare can have dire consequences, you should not be Pikachu shocked face when you specifically do not listen/follow rules. Inserting an IV or drawing blood is pretty routine procedure. If you smoke a little too much the night before and wake up super groggy, then proceed to cause nerve damage by doing the procedure incorrectly that's a consequence someone else faces because you couldn't follow the rules of the field.", "Exactly. THC testing is archaic and also rather pointless in terms of safety concerns because of the length of time it's detectable in your system ... but those are the terms of the job in some fields. If cannabis is THAT important to you, then you need to pick a different job.", "You just displayed some serious ignorance. A healthcare professional can be stone cold sober during their work day but then smoke at night and it would be in their system for at least a month. So what, your healthcare professional isn\u2019t allowed to recreationally use substances off the clock on their own time? That\u2019s such crap.", "Oh ok. That makes more sense then.", "He was clean when he tested for the job months ago. Had another test this past week and failed.", "Exactly. THC lasts longer in your system which means it's effects on your brain last even hours after you smoked. [THC can affect concentration, among other things.

He wasn't fired for the longest time because our manager liked having another guy to buddy around with and because his aunt was a nurse. We all complained about him but nothing ever happened. Eventually he did get fired for something unrelated (he was late/no show too many times and the manager couldn't pull strings for him with HR, though he tried.)\n\nThat place was a shit show for many reasons including that, and I'm so glad I don't work there anymore.", "[deleted]", "The entire purpose of my second paragraph was to point out that very problem!", "Info: why is he mad at YOU when he failed the test?", "Thc be detected in urine much longer than a day or 2.

Thc is fat soluble so the more fat you have on your body the longer it can take to go away. That doesn't mean it's active in your bloodstream though.

I'm talking about the EFFECT the drug has and how thay can impair their ability. For people with ADHD adderal is beneficial as it helps them focus. For people with mental ilness their drugs are also beneficial and most likely helps them do their job effectively, so its not a problem.

A child has that kind of attitude: \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell me that super risky behavior would get me in trouble?! This is all YOUR fault.\u201d", "Nope NTA.  He made the choice to continue using and now he\u2019s facing the consequences of that choice. You have done nothing wrong", "NTA.

He has no right to play the victim card rn", "Nta he knew better", "NTA and I would be all \"I told you so\"", "No judgement from me, but what job have you been doing in health care since you were 18?", "NTA. Each field has its ordinary sins and each has a special \"but really really dont do this one we are not kidding you will lose your job\" kind of misbehavior. In health care, it's don't get caught with illegal drugs. He got hammered with that message over and over, but he didnt think they were serious? His real problem isnt the occasional weed, its being stupid to do it with that kind of job. Hard not to at least sympathize with the intellectual disability.", "*Sigh*\u2026 as a stoner I get his anger. It\u2019s not towards you, OP, it\u2019s towards the dumb system. You\u2019re absolutely right; we take a risk, and sometimes it blows up in our face. There\u2019s no point in getting mad, that\u2019s just how it is. NTA, you don\u2019t have anything to do with it really. We can\u2019t blame others for our own decisions. \n\nThis is actually a reason I\u2019m stepping away from my use, 2023 is the year I told myself I\u2019m done. Even though it\u2019s now legal in my state, there\u2019s just too much stigma around it that just doesn\u2019t fit into my life anymore.", "NTA", "NTA. If he can\u2019t not use to pass a freakin drug test that a company requires he doesn\u2019t deserve to be hired IMO.

You warned him, he chose to ignore the warning, and it bit him in the ass. Too bad, so sad. Maybe he'll use this as a learning experience. If he's gonna blame you for his own stupid shit, you might want to re-evauate your involvement with him- his whole attitude isn't even close to mature.", "NTA, you warned him he disregarded your warnings... suck it up bud its on you", "NTA. He needs to take ownership of his choices and not expect you to sympathize with something that would also get you fired.", "NTA. I'll also add, you're not his mother. It's up to him to follow the rules. It's unreasonable for him to expect you to make him follow the rules and have empathy for his poor choice.", "NTA my god of course not, why is he taking this out on you", "NTA.

He knew the requirement. I don\u2019t think weed should be illegal,  but I\u2019m in a field where unless it\u2019s legalized federally, I can\u2019t do it. Even then I may not be able to. So\u2026I don\u2019t do it\u2026and if I were to, I know the consequences. Wouldn\u2019t be nobodies fault but mine.", "NTA\n\nJust cause it is legal, does not mean that it is tolerated at work.\n\nI am reminded of when it started to become legal, the story that hit the news:  Guy was first in line to get it, made a big deal about it.  When he got back to work, not only did he have to go and do a pee test, but also was served with his termination after that.  (He failed)  Then he tried to sue and lost and the court was very clear about that, which is that it may be legal, but companies do not have to tolerate such.  And it was a bad move for him to call off of work and be seen on the local news as well.", "Nta he knew the risk and you warned him, I have never used recreational drugs only used them for pain relief after surgery", "NTA. You're not his mom or his keeper. You told him to be careful, he ignored you, and is now mad that his actions have consequences. It sounds like he wants you to coddle him for his own actions, and to act as if he's valid in being upset when he broke the rules he agreed to. \n\nYou're not responsible for him. You warned him, his actions are his own.", "We need more context, does he worked high? As is Thc over 10ng, if not damn these rules are dumb.

It doesn't matter whether you think the rules are fair or not, they're the rules at his workplace and so either abide by them or face the consequences.\n\nIf you feel the rules are too onerous for you, then quit and find another job.", "Just out of curiosity, do the tests know the difference between regular marijuana THC and Delta 8? Because one is legal in my state and the other isn't and I'm wondering how they could tell in like workplace tests like that.", "Where are you geographically?", "Which is probably why some jobs simply require you to abstain to be on the safe side. You simply can't estimate if someone is using responsibly or not, and some people lie and ruin it for everyone else I assume. Wouldn't want a critical care or neonatal nurse, or trauma doc to be anything less than sharp for example.\n\nI do agree that there are probably people who do not indulge in MJ in a way that affects work, but from  an employer's view, I do see the liability, because if someone comes to the job high and something fatal happens, you can't always undo the damage. The tests are probably archaic, but employers will always try to cover their asses. If I know an employee and know they are always on top of their game, I wouldn't care what they did, but I guess if you are removed from the actual line of work and sitting in some administrative lair, and don't have people you trust supervising nor know any employee personally, you wouldn't be able to be lenient and forensically safe at the same time.\n\nA sip of wine usually also does not affect you and a glass or two might affect me more than you or vice versa, so sticking to \"not working and drinking\" would theoretically be the the safest route, even more so when you have no test to determine when an individual is affected.", ">if they drink alcohol off duty you wouldn\u2019t expect them to be fired.\n\nThere are formulas to calculate how long it takes for alcohol to be out of your system (depending on individual stats, weight, amount consumed etc.) and yes, doctors would be expected to take that into consideration when drinking off duty. I can't drink massive amounts in my \"off duty time\" and go to work four hours later and not expect to face consequences for effectively turning up drunk to use hyperbole. My partner is an EMS worker and always is mindful of how much he drinks the night before very early shifts, because sometimes off duty can affect on duty if the time is simply too short for physiological processes/metabolism doing it's thing.", "> Agreed, but the problem os that THC stays in your system for a much longer time, so you can test positive at work for having smoked on your weekend off and been perfectly sober at work. \n\nYes, that is exactly the problem. If you can't differentiate between people using responsibly and people using irresponsibly, or test for being affected or not, the safest choice for some jobs (affecting lives) is to chose people who don't use. Even if that unfairly excludes those who are not ever impaired during work hours.", "Yup. I work in an office setting. A guy used to come in and close his office door and just sleep it off.  Another colleague told us that every time he traveled, one guy who was part of the team showed up EVERY morning completely smashed.  And I've heard of a couple of other such stories over the years.", "Lol dude I used to work in an office setting (now fully remote) The dude who used to do that just went into his office and locked his door and slept it off.  Wasn't on my team. Had no clue how his work product was, but considering he wasn't disciplined or anything, maybe he got a lot done once he woke up. Anyway, not my business...And I've heard of such stories from other colleagues as well...", "Smoking weed and using drugs at parties is an addict? \n\nThat's pretty normal and not a sign of addiction at all ..\n\nAlso suggesting she should leave because he smokes regularly?

They weren't sick enough for step-down or the ICU, but they needed more careful attention than they could get on the medical ward.  So the intern would write the order 'transfer to ward 7700.'  And it was true, the level of nursing care on that ward was higher than anywhere else in the hospital.\n\nHere's the kicker: every patient on ward 7700 had a Demerol order (a synthetic narcotic, not dissimilar to heroin or fentanyl.)  None of the Demerol went into the patients; it was for the nurses.", "Maybe it\u2019s just the places I worked but if drug testing was required it was said up front during the interview or on the application itself ( we obviously didn\u2019t know when or who would be tested until the moment) and it was common knowledge new hires would be chosen.", "My point is that it's not silly because there's potential for the consequences to be worse. So maybe on a surface level it's silly to compare, but a deeper look shows that while the consequences won't always happen they could end up being really severe and not just affect your own life.", "The (infusion/compounding, not hospital or retail) pharmacy my mom worked in from about 2000-2018 did quarterly random testing the whole time, and I think they still do for those who work patient facing or have access to the meds.

He was an ah for ignoring not just OP's warnings, but also the policy about random drug testing that was no doubt on his employment forms.  He sounds immature: you take the employers' money, you have to follow the employers' policies/rules, and it doesn't matter what he believed personally should be true or not about THC, he got caught.   And I also suspect that the employer may have had a concern about his behavior and/or appearance that triggered the drug test and he's unwilling to take responsibility.", "No this is a terrible analogy. \n\nOther drugs that get tested for are out of your system in days. THC sticks around in your fat reserves for weeks or months, but the effect on your brain does not stay that long. The tests do not show how large a dose you took. It shows you used something with THC. It doesn\u2019t show that you used unhealthy levels monthly vs conservative levels every week. The tests detect THC despite your not being affected by it any longer. But if you took another tested drug a week earlier it would not show up despite all of them being more harmful. If they can\u2019t come up with more accurate THC testing they need to drop them from panels, but they will do the opposite.", "Your own article states that the test for EtG will detect \"heavy alcohol use in the past 80 hours (3.3 days).\"\n\nTHC will hang around at detectable levels for much longer than that. The article also lists several products (aftershave, mouthwash, etc) that can interfere with the EtG test. \n\nI'm in agreement with you that testing for THC should be less sensitive to past use (1 week +).
