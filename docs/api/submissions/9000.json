We have 2 children (14M and 11F). Our marriage has overall been very great with little fights up till now.\n\nMy wife works at a church every Sunday to make food to share with our community. As we were about to leave, an acquaintance of mine comes up to me and asks if this my wife\u2019s ring. It was. I asked how he got it. He told me found in the kitchen. I took the ring and kept it in my pocket. \n\nWhen she was done and came to me to leave, I asked if there\u2019s anything she was forgetting. She was confused saying no and we left. \n\nI was hurt that she hadn\u2019t even thought to check if she was missing anything because the ring had belonged to my mother before making it irreplaceable.\n\nFor the last couple of days, my wife has been looking around the house frantically. She never once told me that she had lost her ring until on Wednesday. She came to me sobbing that she had lost her ring and I said it was okay. I went to my bedroom drawer and gave her ring back to her.\n\nShe instantly went from sad to mad. She yelled at me saying that I caused to her to think that her ring was lost and that I caused her so much stress. I said that she HAD lost her ring but my friend had found it. I said it was irresponsible to leave the ring when she could\u2019ve put it in her pocket or whatnot. \n \nShe\u2019s been cold and refusing to talk when the children aren\u2019t around so I need unbiased opinions.

But still you have this idea and purposely do it to make her feel that.", "She didn't lose it. She took it off when she was doing the dishes or something similar in the kitchen.

My husband occasionally will pick them up and remind me about them but most the time leaves them for me to find but with a gentle reminder I'm not wearing my rings to make her panic for a few days is just mean and doesn't teach anything other than not to trust you.", "YTA that was really childish.

It was  downright mean and spiteful.\n\nYour wife has every right to be angry with you for your horrible behavior.\n\nI can't believe you came here to ask Reddit to exonerate you for such horrendous behavior.

She forgot the ring, I get that it hurt you but it was an accident. It wasn't even actually lost, your friend gave it to you.

You should have returned her ring when you received it from your friend and then had a serious discussion about how careless she had been.  Instead, you caused her a lot of worry to 'teach her a lesson?'  Yeah, definitely AH territory.", "YTA big time. You took this as an opportunity to belittle your wife and made yourself feel powerful instead of acknowledging her genuine mistake (which, by the way, was probably caused by your acquaintance moving the ring when she'd normally see it and put it back on).

Then on top of that you had the audacity to watch her panic while looking for it and still didn't say anything until she had quite clearly become very upset! I'd be mad at you too for taking sadistic enjoyment out of teaching me a lesson. MAJOR AH.", "YTA. How can she trust you when you would do something like that? How cruel can you be, watching her frantic and upset? Unbelievably heartless. I don\u2019t blame her for not talking to you.", "YTA.

This is way beyond any prank or education you think it could be.\n\nIn most countries food preparation for others in any public function is severely regulated, and one such regulation is thorough hygiene by removing bracelets, rings and any other jewelry from fingers, hands and arms. So it was only logical for her to remove it.\n\nThe correct reaction would have been to ask your friend to put it back to where he found it, then ask your wife \"I see you removed your ring for hygienic reasons, did you leave it in the kitchen?\"", "YTA \n\nMy ex husband threw a huge fit over my wedding ring, so I made sure to leave it on his desk when I left.", "I hope she returns the precious ring and leaves your selfish ass", "Major YTA! You do realise that when you were a piece of jewelry all the time, you kind of stop feeling that they are there. That is how pick pocket works. She also probably had so many things in her mind, and had worked hard to make sure that everyone was having a good time. And instead of giving it to her back there and then, you decided to play mind games to \"punish\" her! She was clearly really devastated about it, and you put her through this on purpose.

This was your little fee fees were hurt because something slipped her mind.  It's a ring, not a child.  Better solution would have been to let her know right away, let her freak out she almost forgot it, then suggest maybe a necklace she can put it on when she's afraid it will end up in the main course.

I seriously don\u2019t know how I lost it. But sometimes we get distracted or shit happens or whatever. I never found it. I was in a panic for like a month, and I still think about it a decade later. My guess is your wife felt bad enough without your making it worse. Grow up and try to be a decent person.", "YTA she forgot. It's a human mistake and you decided to be an ass to her by testing her, obviously she noticed it and have been looking for it for days", "YTA she took it off in the kitchen, she knew where she had taken it off and would of picked it up again if your friend hadn't taken it. He gave it you to give to her, not hide it, you deceived her. You were malicious and cruel, you did it to cause hurt and anguish to someone you claim to love, to 'punish' her. You are playing cruel mind games and destroying any trust your wife has for you. Your wife knows you set out to hurt her too. So she no longer trusts you and she knows you set out to be cruel to her.

Yeah\u2026YTA!", "You didnt do it to teach her a lesson, you did it to make yourself feel better by being a dick.", "YTA. But hey!

It\u2019s pretty common for people to take off rings when working with food. It\u2019s pretty cruel to intentionally hide someone\u2019s treasured possession from them.

You owe her an apology but you also need to learn to de-center yourself.", "Oh of course nta. You have never lost anything, forgotten something, nor made a mistake. You are perfect. If you ever had though, it is definitely part of a healthy relationship to smugly, condescendingly punish your partner. Thank god you are so perfect!\n\nYTA and I hope there are instructive consequences in your future.", "Yes a big asshole", "YTA She misplaced it ACCIDENTALLY while doing charity work.

Is there anything I can help you with?\" For a woman to forget something like a wedding ring means any number of things. Worried, overwhelmed, lack of sleep, too busy with responsibilities, struggling. But you decided to be a flaming asshole and \"teach her a lesson\". \n\nThat's not love. That's utterly pathetic, controlling, dominating, and degrading!\n\nWTF is wrong with you?", "Ever heard of out of sight out of mind? She probably took her ring off to prevent bacteria and food build up from getting on it (which is responsible). So she takes it off and moves on wifh the day and just completely forgot about it.

Everyone knows when someone loses a wedding ring it's a very expensive, embarrassing mistake so she was hoping to find it herself to not cause any issues between you two.

We have 2 children (14M and 11F). Our marriage has overall been very great with little fights up till now.\n\nMy wife works at a church every Sunday to make food to share with our community. As we were about to leave, an acquaintance of mine comes up to me and asks if this my wife\u2019s ring. It was. I asked how he got it. He told me found in the kitchen. I took the ring and kept it in my pocket. \n\nWhen she was done and came to me to leave, I asked if there\u2019s anything she was forgetting. She was confused saying no and we left. \n\nI was hurt that she hadn\u2019t even thought to check if she was missing anything because the ring had belonged to my mother before making it irreplaceable.\n\nFor the last couple of days, my wife has been looking around the house frantically. She never once told me that she had lost her ring until on Wednesday. She came to me sobbing that she had lost her ring and I said it was okay. I went to my bedroom drawer and gave her ring back to her.\n\nShe instantly went from sad to mad. She yelled at me saying that I caused to her to think that her ring was lost and that I caused her so much stress. I said that she HAD lost her ring but my friend had found it. I said it was irresponsible to leave the ring when she could\u2019ve put it in her pocket or whatnot. \n \nShe\u2019s been cold and refusing to talk when the children aren\u2019t around so I need unbiased opinions. AITA for making my wife think she had lost our wedding ring?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Like you forgot that she's your wife and not your competitor.", "Unpopular but NTA for me. The indignant that she didn\u2019t notice right away is justified. It would have been less AH if OP had revealed the ring that night instead of waiting, but it just seems justified to me that he \u2018played games\u2019", "Also she mostly would had remembered the ring when she had saw it leayibg in the kitchen where she is working. But the friend took it away and now it was \"out of sight, out of mind\".\n\nShe didn't lose the ring, she put it away and then the friend toke it away.

You mostly don't think about the ring untill you see it.\n\nYTA This hiding it was a punishment and so shit.", "Also, it\u2019s a physical item.  It isn\u2019t the sanctity of her marriage.  She took it off making community food.  It was an accident.  \n\nDamn, YTA big time.  I don\u2019t wear my ring often.  It\u2019s not a symbol of how I feel about my marriage.  Usually it\u2019s because I\u2019m kicking around the house with my kids, baking, gardening, exercising.  \n\nMy marriage is the most important thing in my life.  My ring, eh.  It\u2019s obviously very sentimental to me, but it\u2019s a physical item.  It\u2019s not that important in the scheme of things.  You made WAY to big a deal of this.  She didn\u2019t cheat on you.

It's irreplaceable!!!!! /s\n\n\n Is OP implying his wife was disrespecting his late mother by misplacing  the ring?", "YTA. \n\nYou need counseling to unravel the family dynamic from your childhood that made you ignore the obvious, kind, considerate, loving path of immediately giving her the ring back and instead choose the path of feeling unnecessarily hurt and maliciously concealing that the ring was found and that you had it so you could punish her for forgetting it. You\u2019re not normal, you\u2019re not nice, and it\u2019s likely that the real legacy of your mother is not a beautiful piece of jewelry but your lack of love and empathy.\n\nCounseling. Get it.", "Exactly this. Your wife was at church volunteering, took the ring off to keep it clean and safe while food prepping, and forgot it. It happens. It doesn't mean she is being disrespectful of you or the marriage.\n\nAnd she obviously has been looking for it for days.\n\n I just don't get what your point was.\n\nYTA", "The necklace is a fantastic idea, and I need to get one myself.
