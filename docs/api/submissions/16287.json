I used to work somewhere and made a few male friends, there were simply no females around my age. The females that were there, were like 40+ and I started there at 20, I\u2019m now 28. I have ALWAYS kept it professional with the guys, no flirting whatsoever, never wanted to give anyone the wrong idea. I was just there to get a bag, period. So the guys I was cool with, I met their wives at a work event and we hit it off. Became good friends with one of them, let\u2019s call her Jane and her husband Jack(my coworker), ended up having a mutual friends. I would definitely say I was closer to her than with her husband, duh, who was my coworker. \n\nWe\u2019re not as close anymore, I still consider her a friend, but we simply grew apart. I still would see her at mutual friends parties and we always talk and catch up like nothing had changed. She has ALWAYS told me, if I hear anything at work about her husband, about him even flirting with anyone at work, to let her know asap. There was nothing to tell, we didn\u2019t get a lot of female hires. I haven\u2019t worked there in a couple years, but I still know people that do. In the last 5 years or so, there have been more young women getting hired.\nSomeone reached out to me asking if I was still friends with Jane and I said yes. They proceeded to tell me Jack was talking all this mess about wanting to f*ck one of the girls there, and this girl had already dubbed herself the name \u201ceverybody\u2019s girl.\u201d They were giving me too many specific details, sounded more than just a rumor. \n\nThe day they told me, they said Jack had called out the night before and so did everybody\u2019s girl. Apparently, Jack and and everybody\u2019s girl still drove to work, he parked his car and they left in hers. They saw that in the security cameras, and the gossip SPREAD. I waited until I got more information, and it was too much, I couldn\u2019t keep holding it in. So I reached out to Jane and told her everything I knew. Since she\u2019s always told me to tell her if I heard anything, I would want the same. \nShe blew up on him, as I knew she would. He later called my phone through her phone, and yelled all sorts of profanity at me saying I\u2019m the reason their little family is breaking up. I hung up, obvi, cause boy who the tf are you to tell me I ruined y\u2019all when you\u2019re the one that wanted to get your d*ck wet. I did have my doubts when I hadn\u2019t heard from Jane until the next day, like maybe they were just rumours and he actually didn\u2019t do anything. \nJane later reached out and said he confessed everything, so I was right. He lied to her said he got called in early to work, when in reality he called out sick and left with everybody\u2019s girl.\n\nHowever a couple people have told me, I shouldn\u2019t have gotten involved, but if I was in that situation I would wanna know. Although not everyone might feel that way, I always remembered Jane told me she would wanna know as well. If she hadn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done.\nSo AITA??", "created_utc": 1683121060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136ksf3/aita_for_telling_a_friend_i_heard_a_rumor_her/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't ruin Jack's family - he did it himself. If he wanted to keep it, he shouldn't have cheated. I have a feeling it wasn't the first time he did something like this, since Jane had asked you to watch him. She probably had a reason to be suspicious.", "NTA.  She suspected him of cheating.  If not, she wouldn't have asked you to tell her if you found out about him messing around.  You simply did as she asked.\n\nYou didn't break up his family.  He did.", "NTA - as others have said, you conveyed information to a friend that they asked for ... which turned out to be true. Even if not requested, I support sharing that type of info - and then it is up to them to decide. \n\nHe is solely to blame ... I have gotten downvoted in the past from those who think a single, unattached woman is equally to blame as the married man for having consensual relations. She is guilty of poor judgment, but HE is the one who had an affair, HE cheated, HE broke up his family.", "NTA. A friend asked you to tell her. You told her. You were careful to not jump to conclusions. I would want to know too.", "NTA. You did the right thing.", " NTA. Jane told you she wanted to know. Job well done \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc", "NTA. It seemed like Jane appreciated what you did. And it is a relief that what you conveyed is true.\n\nThere must have been more things Jane knows for Jack to confess so quickly.", "NTA. Jane already knew.", "NTA. Just to reiterate, there really isn\u2019t a grey area here. You were asked to relay anything you heard. You did. \n\nI will say, her reaction likely stemmed more from her world blowing up than you being an asshole or not an asshole. Not saying it was called for, but from the outside this is all pretty clearly not about you and not your problem. If I had been the wife who asked, I\u2019d hate it but I\u2019d be glad someone was reliable and trustworthy.", "NTA - someone you had a positive relationship with asked a favor, and you obliged. Not only did you simply do what you were asked, you even waited to make sure it wasn't just hearsay. Good on you, OP.", "A horrible position to be in. However, I cannot imagine the world and his dog knowing that my partner was over the side with someone and the only person who didn't have a clue was me. How embarrassing and humiliating must that be?\n\nDifficult conversation to have but, on balance, I think it was the right thing to do. NTA", "NTA:  I think Jane already had her doubts that Jack could/would do something like this, and was the reason she asked you to tell her if you ever found anything out. You didn't base it off of one little whisper either, you had plenty of reason to suspect he had cheated on her.", "NTA. You told her exactly what you knew, they went to work and left in a single car. Jack had the chance to explain why he lied about going to work; Jack screwed himself. \n\nWhen you cheat, you're the one who ruins the relationship, its not anyone else's fault.", "NTA. You protected her friend and that was the right thing to do. You didn't ruin anybody's family. The guy who cheated on his wife did that. You just protected her from gaslighting and potential sexual health issues. You're a good friend and a good person.", "Nta he was the one that broke up his family not you.", "The fact that she had such a weird ask (any rumors if her husband was flirting--who asks their husband's coworker something like that???) I suspect he'd already cheated in the past and she was simply waiting for the other shoe to drop.  I lean toward ESH  obviously the husband for being a cheater, Jane for putting you in the middle, and you to a lesser degree for getting involved in someone else's marriage.", "NTA, she asked you to tell her if you heard anything. Obviously she had suspicions already.", "OP - NTA.  This was a tough one, choosing a once close friend over a coworker you see regularly, who happened to be married.  It seems like Jane had been suspecting something for a long time, asked for reports, and Jack eventually just got sloppy in front of the office.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
