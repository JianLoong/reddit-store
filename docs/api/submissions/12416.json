Facts: her dog is poorly trained and a danger to others. Facts > feelings. I do wonder what it will take for her dog (or her AND her dog together) to be kicked out of your condo / apartment building. Complain to management. Do it often, with details of every lunge and scary encounter.", "NTA\n\nShe needed that fact brought home before a preventable incident occurs.  A lunging untrained dog can be dangerous.", "NTA. Nothing wrong with telling it like it is. Especially, when it comes to animals that can potentially be dangerous. My dog is reactive to other dogs as well, at a distance. Up close, he becomes a scaredy-cat. But, I don\u2019t blame people with other small dogs (my dog is 20lbs) who go around when my dog\u2019s barking up a storm.", "NTA - By the sounds of it you stated a fact. I really cannot stand people who have trained their animals to be little monsters and expect others to put up with the result. Because let's be clear, by rewarding bad behaviour and/or failing to punish it, they have trained the animal to behave this way. I try to be understanding with rescue animals because obviously, but 90% or more that's either not true or incidental.", "As the responsible owner of a GSD Security Unit (German Shepard), your concerns are valid. My dog is just 50lbs and still is growing, but she can still cause serious injury to another dog or a person if I don't keep control (which I do most of the time... she is a puppy, so a few accidents have happened, but I was able to intervene before anything serious pccured.)\n\nIf my dog can cause harm at HALF the size of the dog you're talking about, then she is not taking the threat seriously. NTA - complain to MGMT ASAP.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You are being a responsible dog owner by being concerned for his well-being and I respect how you confronted her.", "NTA. It's on owner(s) to make sure their pet is safe/happy and that others are safe/happy around their pet.\n\nI have a larger reactive dog (he's like 50-55ish lbs). I am intentional about when and how I walk him and my partner and I have worked with him a lot on it. When I exercise/walk him, I give other animals (especially dogs and cats) wide berth (even after training). I'm also still very cautious/watch him closely around other animals (even if he's been reactive to some not all of them).", "NTA\n\nDelusional and dangerous dog owners need a reality check.", "\"That is unfortunate.\" NTA.", "The building did have an incident where someone's reactive dog drew blood and attacked 2 dogs on 3 separate occasions. This particular individual is friends with the developer who is also on the condo board and is living in his unit at a massively reduced rate and he would NEVER allow them to kick her out unfortunately.", "Doesn't sound like she took that fact in if she's going around complaining about how OP hurt her feelings. She's focusing on the wrong thing.", "My dog at the end of the day is an animal it does not like other animals all up in his personal space. He likes dogs that sniff and back off and are respectful of its personal space... You know trained dogs? \n\nA friend of mine started having issues with his dog when moving to this place, and had issues with this persons dog where the dog lunges and starts barking at his dog. What does my friend do? Hires a trainer to help with his dogs' reactivity. He is a responsible dog owner.", "JESUS. My honest advice, unfortunately, is that if you really want to keep your dog safe, you might need to move. Another option, if anything does happen, is to get municipal bylaw / animal control / code enforcement involved. While the developer may not care, your city very well may. And they can issue legally binding orders, such as muzzling the dog.", "That's where you get police involved instead of condo boards.", "True, but at least she was told and can't use the excuse of ignorance to the issue.", "I'm not too worried about it, our schedules are complete opposites but it's mainly why we stopped hanging out. I used \"friend\" because if I don't message her first she would not message me lol. Moving is unlikely as while I know her friend the developer my family is the largest investor so I live in the PH.", "I feel like this is a massive overreaction... I think you are forgetting normal people who live in these buildings, people who make mistakes. No need to make such rash decisions. The dog has not hurt anyone yet. It just needs to be properly trained.", "Yeah, there's that.", ">The building did have an incident where someone's reactive dog drew blood and attacked 2 dogs on 3 separate occasions. \n\nIt's your discretion, I'm just thinking that's a serious problem dog. If the owners agree to remedy the issue with dog training/classes and protective measures, that's great. But an ongoing danger to your community should be addressed.", "\u201cYet\u201d. And when it does (sending a dog to a trainer, even a \u201cpolice academy\u201d training, only works if the owner keeps up with it. She hasn\u2019t yet sooooo don\u2019t hold your breath) there will be an injured person and/or a severely injured/dead dog and that big dog will be BE\u2019ed.

Actually it goes beyond a pet peeve but idk what else to call something that I see often and stirs a great rage in me. \n\nDogs are great. They're wonderful, incredible, better than humanity deserves in most cases. Dogs also have sharp teeth and strong jaws and many of them are large and strong and very capable of causing harm to others around them. If you are going to have a dog, you have to take responsibility for them. You have to teach them manners and at least basic obedience. You have to treat them with respect and acknowledge that they, especially if they're big and strong, can absolutely be dangerous. People who don't do this drive me up the fucking wall. \n\nNTA. Do what you have to to keep you and your own dog safe.", "NTA. I live in a city building with tons of dogs. My heart aches for those neglected animals stuck in a tiny apartment or crate all day alone since their owner is back to the office in person. If your dog isn't able to go out for a walk or in the yard a few times a day, don't get a dog. You're confining them to prison for your own ego."]}
