Husband is worse for being dead weight and apparently not giving a shit about anyone but himself. But what you did was counterproductive and passive aggressive. You wanted him to feel the inconvenience you feel. I get it. But neither the dog nor your husband understood why you did what you did, and therefore it was pointless.", "Thing is, you punished the dog, not your husband. ESH.", "Your husband sounds shitty, but that isn't the dogs fault. ESH", "I think you already know that what you did had excellent reasons but did exactly nothing to help you lol.\n\nSo I'm skipping judgment and just noting that OP, you *need* to address the hugely disproportionate balance of labor and childcare. He is a dad now. He needs to step up. Rather than let the resentment build up inside you, sit him down and tell him exactly what you and your child need from him. Don't ask for it, don't hedge around it, don't apologize for needing more from him - I'm also working on doing this (labor division) for myself with a therpist's help, and people like me (us?) often approach conversations as if we're burdening someone. Don't do that. You aren't. You have every right to expect he treat you as a partner and your kid as his own.\n\nLay out your expectations and communicate your feelings. Leave doggo out of it.

Do you guys ever talk to each other?", "NTA- but you need to tell Him you are drowning and need help. Make a list of everything you are doing and then u both pick items one at a time to spilt with the baby. Also no more only u up at nights- he needs to take a two or three every week. Also when he wants his mental health walks at the beach- give him the kid, also no more 2 hour showers, and he will now be taking a fiber supplement and no cell phones in the bathroom bc no more hour long BMs (stick the kid in their with him if need be)", "ESH, as everyone else said, you punished the dog instead of talking to your husband.\n\nHowever I'm confused as to why your husband would randomly call you while he was on his way to work to ask if you had taken care of the dog.

He\u2018s obviously leagues ahead of you in his AHishness but you punished the dog instead of him.", "ESH. Sort it out, or get rid of the dog.", "You might try discussing the situation and his lifestyle.", "NTA. Talkng care of the dog is the least he can do. He's married to you and the father of your child. I think you should sit with him about his roles in the house, and how stressful it is on you to take care of everything", "ESH. People are so immature and petty. FFS, sit down and have a calm discussion about how both your lives have changed and the division of labor. \n\nYour husband also sounds like he\u2019s suffering from anxiety. He should see a doctor.", "ESH but you moreso. Have a conversation with your husband instead of punishing the poor dog.", "I don't know, if the dog is the best decision to make your very valid point.

We have 5yr old dog and we recently had our first baby which has created a new dynamic in our relationship. I feel like my husband is continuing his life like there is no little person depending on us, whereas I have completely changed my life around.

You need to do this ASAP. This will give you both enough time for each of yourselves to after yourselves. You'll both not get burnt out for having to do everything and then \"teaching the other to chip in\" without the actual teaching.\n\nSit down and agree who will do the laundry, cleaning bottles, organising child care, taking care of the dog and getting up at night to look after baby. You'll then be able to find time to go to gym/ relax/ sleep. Work together and co-ordinate your time. Remember to add time for both of you yo spend romantic time together.", "ESH. The dog is innocent here. Husband is massively an AH for not being a parent at all. Those things you listed off - the long time spent in the bathroom, going to the gym, walks on the beach alone - any one of those is horrifyingly bad behavior considering he's a new parent. But then putting it all together? He's being an overwhelming shockingly bad and absent parent, sounds like. I don't know what his redeeming qualities could possibly be.", "YTA for punishing the dog,  and not using your words.\n\nWhen you decide to be a grown up have a sit down conversation about all this drama in your life", "It was passive aggressive and and not constructive at all. Especially for how long we\u2019ve been married and how old we are but sometimes you just do something for a short term satisfaction even though you didn\u2019t really make a point like you thought you would at that moment \ud83d\ude29", "Op said she works close to the house, so she could have taken care of the dog if husband didn't do it.", "I definitely want to avoid getting to resentment. Although I understand a baby is such a huge adjustment on our life since we\u2019ve been together without one for a long time, I expected him to adjust at the same pace as me. Definitely will communicate what I need instead of assuming he figure it out and be disappointed when he doesn\u2019t", "He called me because I left the house before he got out of the shower. If that happens he usually calls to say \u201chave a good day\u201d.", "No . There was nothing notable for anxiety- he was stressed cuz he was gonna be late for work. This is a outrageous armchair diagnosis.", "Can you say why you think he\u2019s suffering from anxiety? I didn\u2019t think about that and would absolutely want to help him if that is the case", "Like I said, I get it. You didn't do any irreparable damage or anything. It just didn't help address the root cause of the situation, which is that your husband at least implicitly believes his time is more valuable than yours. I can see why you acted rashly in the moment. But he either doesn't understand or doesn't care, so your action didn't have the intended effect.", "So, why are you doing it all and not leaving some work for him, or delegating or asking him for help or telling what he can do or somehow communicating with him that you feel like he isn\u2019t pitching in his fair share?? \n\nSpeak up! \n\nYTA. \n\nI swear like 99% of these situations could so easily be avoided by talking. \n\nWhy are we afraid to share our feelings, when it\u2019s the only way to fix the problems?", "I would guess that the dog hadn't been taken care of at all that morning, which would mean it probably hadnt used the bathroom since the night before. 10 minutes is a long time when you havent used the bathroom all night. But I don't care if it's one minute. Making the dog suffer intentionally for any length of time for petty revenge is an AH move.", "It's a big change but please don't make excuses for him (I'm sure he'll do that just fine on his own). He shouldn't need you to point out what's obvious, so I think being disappointed is totally reasonable! But yeah, this is the point where you make it known. Good luck, OP! :)", "Oh he has already adjusted. He's happily adjusted to you taking on the full burden. What on earth are you waiting for? The longer you take the more likely he is going to believe that this situation is acceptable.", "Trust me I already feel pretty shitty"]}
