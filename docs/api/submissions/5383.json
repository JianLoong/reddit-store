Then go to the bathroom.\n\nI hope you shit your pants. \n\nThat's what you did to your dog. YTA.\n\nAs for your husband, what you did will not help the situation at all. You're just being annoying for the sake of being annoying and you know it. Nothing you did was constructive. He's not right to put it all on you, but what did hurt the dog, and sent no message to your husband. \n\nBe an adult and use your words. Think about the example you're setting for your child. Growing up do you want him to learn passive aggressive behavior and weaponizing the dogs discomfort? Or do you want your child to learn communication and teamwork?", "Trust me, it's not worth it. Just end the relationship. He is never going to change, because he already would have changed if he cared and loved you. It's going to be years of fighting, him being completely useless, and you're never going to be equal partners.

And leave the dog with him.\n\nI see people commenting about how you should communicate more, try couples therapy, etc. No, it's not going to work. Maybe for a few weeks, at best. You shouldn't have to teach a grown ass man how to adult and be a father. He just expects you to take care of everything because that's what men usually expect and often get, even without asking.

My suggestion that it might be anxiety is this: the behaviors you described seem avoidant. People struggling with anxiety often exhibit avoidant behaviors: spending a lot of time in the bathroom where no one disturbs them, showering for excessive periods of time, clinging tightly to their routine even when it makes their life more difficult.

Things to reflect on and answer HONESTLY:\n\nWould you leave your baby at home without warning after not meeting it\u2019s needs the way you do every morning, hoping your husband would think to ask if the baby had been fed and changed? \n\nDid you speak to your husband before deciding to make a point? \n\nDid you consider that he may not have even thought to ask if the dog had been taken care of that morning? \n\nDid you realize that if he didn\u2019t, you would have left a dog hungry and without relief all day? \n\nYou\u2019re not thinking straight because you\u2019re a new mom, way too tired, and unsupported by your husband.

That makes you a bit of an AH. \n\nSo now, realizing you are so frustrated you would act this way, talk to your husband. Tell him this isn't working. He doesn't get to do nothing with the dog and the baby, while you do it all. There has to be a new division of labor, the end. You can tell him you are really disappointed he didn't even seem to realize that he had to change his habits/preferences, and that he was fine watching you drown while he went abut his day. And you can admit you should have spoken to him sooner. \n\nBut be very clear. He is an adult who wanted a dog and a baby, he shouldn't need to be \"guided\" through what it means to have them and take care of them. So you will now have a conversation about dividing duties- he does dog stuff, you do baby stuff in the morning, you alternate getting up with the baby, etc- but you aren't going to remind him daily of his general responsibilities, and of course you can both ask for help since this is a partnership that won't always be equal.", "Husband continuing his life as though a baby didn\u2019t just appear, tale as old as time!

Your comments aren\u2019t making you look very remorseful either, just an FYI.", "This honestly makes me want to bash my head against a wall. Yes, your husband sounds completely useless but why, *why*, punish your dog for that? They need routines too, just like people and, they can get stressed when those routines are suddenly broken. Your dog doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. What he/she *does* know, is that they rely on you and your husband to take care of them, just as your child does. Just because it is a dog, *does not* mean you can suddenly stop taking care of them simply to make a point to your husband. Even if it\u2019s just for one morning.\n\nSo my advice to you, is either, sit down and talk to each other like proper adults, or rehome the dog. I honestly don\u2019t ever like the thought of rehoming but, if the *both* of you are not willing to step up and care for it, or it is becoming too much, then perhaps rehoming is the best option.

You\u2019re acknowledging that this wasn\u2019t the right way of dealing with this, so don\u2019t beat yourself up too much!\n\nBut, now is the time to polish up your spine and have a serious conversation with your partner about fairly splitting the physical and mental loads in your new stage of life. If it\u2019s not something you two can\u2019t resolve on your own then book in to see a relationship counsellor for a few sessions to work through it with support.", "If you have to prove a point to your partner that is fine but chose another way to do it, your poor dog should not have to suffer cause you won't talk to your partner,", "> It was a poor communication\n\nNo. It wasn't. It was no communication. \n\nYou didn't talk at all. Poor communication is choosing the wrong way to phrase things. What you did was not even attempt to communicate in the first place.", "But you chose the one \u201cto-do\u201d that actively punishes a living creature that you\u2019re responsible for. The fact that your dog\u2019s wellbeing was an afterthought is what makes you TA.", "Thank you for explaining! Will talk to him to see if that\u2019s the case", "You need to have a conversation with your husband about his lack of support. Create a chart regarding responsibilities and get marriage counseling.\n\nAt the end of the day, love is not enough to stay in a marriage where the SO lacks providing support.\n\nBut my verdict is ESH because the dog like the baby is innocent."]}
