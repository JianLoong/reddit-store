You need to do this ASAP. This will give you both enough time for each of yourselves to after yourselves. You'll both not get burnt out for having to do everything and then \"teaching the other to chip in\" without the actual teaching.\n\nSit down and agree who will do the laundry, cleaning bottles, organising child care, taking care of the dog and getting up at night to look after baby. You'll then be able to find time to go to gym/ relax/ sleep. Work together and co-ordinate your time. Remember to add time for both of you yo spend romantic time together.", "ESH. The dog is innocent here. Husband is massively an AH for not being a parent at all. Those things you listed off - the long time spent in the bathroom, going to the gym, walks on the beach alone - any one of those is horrifyingly bad behavior considering he's a new parent. But then putting it all together? He's being an overwhelming shockingly bad and absent parent, sounds like. I don't know what his redeeming qualities could possibly be.", "YTA for punishing the dog,  and not using your words.\n\nWhen you decide to be a grown up have a sit down conversation about all this drama in your life", "It was passive aggressive and and not constructive at all.

Although I understand a baby is such a huge adjustment on our life since we\u2019ve been together without one for a long time, I expected him to adjust at the same pace as me. Definitely will communicate what I need instead of assuming he figure it out and be disappointed when he doesn\u2019t", "He called me because I left the house before he got out of the shower. If that happens he usually calls to say \u201chave a good day\u201d.", "No . There was nothing notable for anxiety- he was stressed cuz he was gonna be late for work. This is a outrageous armchair diagnosis.", "Can you say why you think he\u2019s suffering from anxiety? I didn\u2019t think about that and would absolutely want to help him if that is the case", "Like I said, I get it. You didn't do any irreparable damage or anything. It just didn't help address the root cause of the situation, which is that your husband at least implicitly believes his time is more valuable than yours. I can see why you acted rashly in the moment. But he either doesn't understand or doesn't care, so your action didn't have the intended effect.", "So, why are you doing it all and not leaving some work for him, or delegating or asking him for help or telling what he can do or somehow communicating with him that you feel like he isn\u2019t pitching in his fair share?? \n\nSpeak up! \n\nYTA. \n\nI swear like 99% of these situations could so easily be avoided by talking. \n\nWhy are we afraid to share our feelings, when it\u2019s the only way to fix the problems?", "I would guess that the dog hadn't been taken care of at all that morning, which would mean it probably hadnt used the bathroom since the night before. 10 minutes is a long time when you havent used the bathroom all night. But I don't care if it's one minute. Making the dog suffer intentionally for any length of time for petty revenge is an AH move.", "It's a big change but please don't make excuses for him (I'm sure he'll do that just fine on his own). He shouldn't need you to point out what's obvious, so I think being disappointed is totally reasonable! But yeah, this is the point where you make it known. Good luck, OP! :)", "Oh he has already adjusted. He's happily adjusted to you taking on the full burden. What on earth are you waiting for? The longer you take the more likely he is going to believe that this situation is acceptable.", "Trust me I already feel pretty shitty", "ESH. Why would you punish your dog to prove a point? Even if you could go back, it\u2019s still not your dog\u2019s normal schedule for no good reason. \n\nThe bigger issue here is your husband. You need to have a sit down with him and divide up the labor. There\u2019s no reason you should be doing everything. When my ex and I had my daughter, we made a plan so that things were as equal as possible. We took turns with middle of the night wake ups and would just wake the other one up if it was their turn. You need a much better plan before you get even more burnt out.", "ESH. I'm really sorry to say that as otherwise you are NTA and your husband is an epic AH. You have absolutely rock solid cause for complaint,  ut this is not how you handle this. You can't not take care of an animal out of the blue. You need to.sit down with your husband and have The Conversation send make clear that you won't be picking up the slack any more. His behaviour is unacceptably selfish.", "What the fuck? You don\u2019t have the courage to confront your husband and create a sustainable system for completing household tasks so you punish your dog? And you didn\u2019t even tell him you punished the dog? You just waited til he called you? He obviously sucks but YTA in this specific situation. What is wrong with you?", "Tomorrow morning when you wake up I want you to hold it in. Don't go to the bathroom. Get up, shower, take care of the kid, make and eat breakfast, drive to work, wait until the time that your husband called you. Then go to the bathroom.\n\nI hope you shit your pants. \n\nThat's what you did to your dog. YTA.\n\nAs for your husband, what you did will not help the situation at all. You're just being annoying for the sake of being annoying and you know it. Nothing you did was constructive. He's not right to put it all on you, but what did hurt the dog, and sent no message to your husband. \n\nBe an adult and use your words. Think about the example you're setting for your child. Growing up do you want him to learn passive aggressive behavior and weaponizing the dogs discomfort? Or do you want your child to learn communication and teamwork?", "Trust me, it's not worth it. Just end the relationship. He is never going to change, because he already would have changed if he cared and loved you. It's going to be years of fighting, him being completely useless, and you're never going to be equal partners. If you leave, just go for 50/50 parenting so you'll have some \"free\" time (apart from taking care of yourself and your own place). And leave the dog with him.\n\nI see people commenting about how you should communicate more, try couples therapy, etc. No, it's not going to work. Maybe for a few weeks, at best. You shouldn't have to teach a grown ass man how to adult and be a father. He just expects you to take care of everything because that's what men usually expect and often get, even without asking. At this point, you don't have a partner, you have a second grown up child in your home who also wants you to baby him. Is that really what you want and need in your life?", "Info: have you addressed your concern/these issues with your husband at all?", "[removed]", "Minor ESH. You need to outline your expectations with your husband. You both work, you both need to contribute. Leaving the dog to suffer is what makes you partially TA.  \n\nWhen your husband goes to the bathroom - after 10 minutes open the door and give him the baby. Tell him on Tues, Thurs, Sat he is responsible for the baby for 1 or 2 hours so you can hit the gym.  You get the baby after work on Monday, Wednes, Friday so he can hit the gym.  Sunday one parent sleeps in. Saturday the other parent sleeps in.", "NTA.  Get the book \u201cFair Play\u201d by Eve Rodsky and have a clear, direct conversation with your husband. He needs to take over X, y, and Z now that you two have a baby. A bunch of new responsibilities come with the new life you both created, and that means a redistribution of labor is in order. He doesn\u2019t get to live an undisturbed life while yours is destroyed. You are partners, and he has to step up. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nSomething's gotta give and don't let it be your sanity.", "ESH. OP, I know this is a difficult time for you. You need to be clear and communicate with him. He HAS to step it up and help or you and the family unit will crash and burn. \n\nYou can\u2019t be passive aggressive and let the dog suffer\u2026you need to sit down, make a list of responsibilities and a schedule with him. Take turns waking up with baby for the night. Give yourselves equal amount of \u201cfree time\u201d. I realize a normal, responsible adult wouldn\u2019t need their partner to tell them to take care of their responsibilities, but clearly that needs to happen here. \n\nI hope things improve!", "OP this makes no sense. You didn\u2019t just get a 5 month old. INFO: What happened when you brought the new born baby home? Was your husband not helping you and doing his fair share?  Or is this some new behaviour? Have you discussed expectations with your husband, before conceiving or during pregnancy?", "You two need communication BADLY. Please I urge you, OP to go to a couple therapist/counselor so you two can communicate with help. This is going to turn even more toxic before a year is up. It's already toxic. You're starting to resent your spouse and feel you are stuck in place while he goes and does all these things. Please go to therapy as a couple and even individual therapy too. \n\nI am unsure which decision to lean towards because you're n.t.a. in a sense but what you did was wrong towards the dog, not your spouse.", "Have a grown up talk. Pick 2 days a week where he gets baby up and ready for daycare. You are both working and should have 50/50. Alternate nights of getting up (unless you are breastfeeding). Take 4 hours for yourself each Saturday. He gets 4 hours for himself too. If he chooses to use those to take an hour long poop and 2 hour shower, then he only gets one hour for the gym. Write down a list of chores and split them 50/50", "Info. What conversations have you had with your husband about this? Both before arrival of baby and now? \n\nOn the one hand, if you have both baby and dog and no limitations on your ability to handle your responsibilities, I 110% get that one adult in a situation like this shouldn't have to carry the mental load and instruct the other on how life will change, what to do each day or what each thing entails,\n\n...but it also sounds like you've been frustrated and this has been festering, so I'm wondering how you've been engaging with this. It also sounds like there might be very different prioritization of personal v household care that you're primarily suffering for, unless you've left out a mountain of stuff.", "No, it sounds like he's suffering from being a lazy fuck.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Early on I did need a lot of help physically and he was a solid partner in carrying the weight. As I started to get my physical strength back I started taking on more responsibilities because I was on maternity leave so I actually had the time to \u201cdo it all\u201d. But now that I\u2019m back at work, it\u2019s becoming impossible to keep up. It\u2019s a failure of communication on my part. I know it.", "His described behavior is avoidant which often signals anxiety. He could be lazy too. Hard to know.", "I\u2019m getting downvoted and that\u2019s okay. My suggestion that it might be anxiety is this: the behaviors you described seem avoidant. People struggling with anxiety often exhibit avoidant behaviors: spending a lot of time in the bathroom where no one disturbs them, showering for excessive periods of time, clinging tightly to their routine even when it makes their life more difficult. Your hubs does all of those things. \n\nYes, he could be oblivious and last, but what if he\u2019s not?", "That\u2019s possible too but maybe not.", "Yes. You need to sit down and talk to him. If he has been able to step up before. He should be able to do it again. I would focus less on the things he does for himself and more on what you need him to take over. \nSplit chores etc. Make sure you schedule time for yourself, gym or something else. Good luck : )", "You should - you defaulted to punishing an animal rather than having an actual conversation with your husband. Your solution solved nothing & was just cruel."]}
