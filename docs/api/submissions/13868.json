There is a store where you have to leave any bags you come in with in a cubby, even if it\u00b4s an empty bag that you are going to use for your purchase. I crocheted a cute tote to use for smaller purchases and was not happy about leaving it in the unattended cubby. I was not in the store for long, but when I went to check out it was gone. The store gave me a gift card for 2 dollars, that is all they will do.\n\nSo fast forward to yesterday, I saw a woman with my bag!! I KNOW it was my bag because I had added a flower that was not in the original pattern, and the yarn was a very distinct color. So I casually said to the woman, what a pretty bag, where did you get it, I would love to have one like it. Thinking maybe someone else stole it and gave it to her. But, no she said, oh, I made it myself. I didn\u00b4t say anything else because she had her kids with her.\n\nBut a few minutes later the kids had wandered off and I went back up to her and said, you know what, culera (asshole in Spanish) I know you stole that bag because I am the one who made it. I hope you enjoy it, but I took your picture and am going to burn you on the FB group we have here.\n\nShe just ignored me and took off, bag and all. I do have a picture of her, but I didn\u00b4t put it up yet. I told my husband what happened and he was mad at ME, that I should have just let it go.

Thief should be called out.", "NTA, ignore your husband. No thief should be casually tolerated. Glad you confronted her, and I definitely would put her on social media.", "NTA. How awful to have your handmade bag stolen.  If you make another bag or anything, try to put your initials on it somewhere or hey, there's name labels!  Maybe you could put a label with your name on it inside the bag, so if somebody stole your stuff again, you could report them to the cops and the bag would have your name to prove it's yours.", "NTA. Call her out. People around her deserve to know.", "Nope. I would've grabbed that bag off her shoulder and dumped all her shit straight on the ground. You're better than me.", "NTA\n\nI know it's only a crocheted bag but, do you have any concrete proof that it's yours (witnesses, videos, pictures)? I'm asking cause why not go the legal route?\n\nWhy use the trashy tribunal (aka Facebook) instead of the actual law?\nShe indeed stole it, and if it's not that long ago maybe the store still has the tape.\n\nYou should only use FB to identify her, crop the picture to only show her face and say some bogus story to help find her.", "No. Nta. Put the picture up", "So you confronted her and didn't take back your bag? What was the point? To look weak?", "NTA. Put her on BLAST.", "NTA. Why is she stealing unattended bags from a store she frequents often and not expecting to get caught at some point, especially in a small town? Her behavior is saying she\u2019s done this before and will again. At the very least, you should tell the store so they\u2019re aware of the behavior too (and maybe they\u2019ll change it to a better policy, like handing the bags to an employee behind the counter).", "NTA for the confrontation.  YWBTH of you posted it on FB", "NTA. But confronting strangers in public, even for their own terrible behavior could have them react in negative and potentially violent ways so be careful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would say something like, \u201cThis woman stole a bag I made myself. Since I\u2019m the creator, I know the bag is one of a kind. If you know her, please convince her to return it.

She has no shame, or she would have given it back to you.", "Do it.    Just make sure it doesn\u2019t allow her to trace it back to you and fuck with your house / car / lives.   \n\nBut I would find a way to do it.", "I personally don\u2019t think you should go as far as to publicly shame her. I do think that maybe you could get away with a sly post on your town\u2019s FB group advertising about your lost bag that you made!", "Wait wait wait. You wouldn't be the Ahole but unless you live outside the USA, do NOT DO THAT. You will be the one humiliated and possibly charged in the end.

Unless you know the law, *do not do this.* If you want police involved *that badly,* call them about the petty theft.", "Ooh, that is a good idea.  I could put up a picture and say someone took my bag my mistake at XYX store.  If you have it, or know who has it, reward is offered.", "Brilliant answer!", "I do live outside the US, but yeah, I think you are right.  What I should have done is grab one of the police, show them the picture proving I made the bag and had them go over to her and make her give it to me.  Oh well.  I do feel better though, haha.", "Exactly! Good luck and I hope you get your bag back!!!", "You can post a picture of your bag if you have it and then say you had it stolen at STORE/ DATE. \n\nIf you want to be extra, you can post the image of the lady and say you found the bag but she wouldn\u2019t give it back to you (with her picture)", "NTA", "NTA but maybe your husband said that because he is worried about your safety. People can be crazy and you never know how someone will react when you confront them", "please give us an update. Burn her on Facebook!!!!!", "NTA. Definitely tell everyone about her stealing your bag. She shouldn\u2019t have done it.", "If she was ashamed, she would've given it back... you warned her. NTA", "Put up the pictures. Name and shame!!!!", "NTA.  Shame is a powerful tool", "I, sadly, know the answer to this one:\n\nBecause \"the law\" could not give less of a fucking shit. If she goes to the cop shop with definitive proof and the woman's name and address, they're going to look at her like she sprouted and extra head and tell her it's \"a civil matter\". She could go straight to the crown prosecutor and there is no way they will bring charges because it's a glorified handful of yarn with no value to them and they don't see such behaviour as a concerning example of a belief system that is damaging to our society as a whole that ought to be addressed.", "I\u2019d name and shame hahaha", "NTA. Go for it, OP", "Nta. Thieves get away with things like that because people don't speak up. Also I have never heard of a store that makes you put your bags away. Shop somewhere different", "NTA. Burn her and ask your husband how he would feel if some one did that to him.", "NTA. i\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t take the bag back. post her all over social media.", "Amen \\^", "NTA I'm all for naming and shaming.", "That might have legal repercussions, so be careful", "I would go back to the store where she stole it from you and give them her photo too. If the store is decent they will ban her.", "Wot?", "NTA\nPersonally I'd make it very clear to her that you aren't going to allow her to simply do whatever she wants, there is nothing wrong with publicly speaking on the actions someone else took, especially if it's true and you have extensive proof, I would find some way to message her and try to get the bag back without any conflict, but if not possible, there's nothing wrong with telling people about what she did do.", "Fuck her. No respect for theifs.", "NTA. Take her down.", "Why be nice to thieves? NTA.", "NTA.  She's a thief & should've been confronted.  You should've forced her to give you the bag back.", "NTA.", "No, it's not! A least in Germany, where I live, it isn't.", "It certainly is not. Maybe in eastern europe, but in the west it is forbidden by privacy laws. If it is the same where op is she could open herself up for legal trouble.", "If she doxxes the woman it\u2019s not allowed.

Say it means so much to you and that it was stolen and it's unique because of this detail, so if anyone sees it, they will know they are looking at thief. Maybe add the info where was it stolen and why (stupid rule).", "Pls update us. This would\u2019ve made me furious.", "NTA", "INFO: You made it, right? Can't you just get the police involved?", "I have decided on a couple of actions I am going to take, will be back with an update later today,", "That is a really good idea.  Am going to do that this afternoon.  It is likely someone there will know her.  This is a small town, where people know each other.", "In the US, there are laws against defamation and laws against the invasion of privacy. There are some laws against revenge porn. I personally am unaware of any laws in the US against public shaming, and I suspect that any such laws would have a hard fight against the 1st Amendment.\n\nI\u2019m really eager to learn about these public shaming laws\u2014it\u2019s concerning to me that these laws would be going unchallenged when they would seem to violate the 1st Amendment."]}
