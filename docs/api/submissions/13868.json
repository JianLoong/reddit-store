There is a store where you have to leave any bags you come in with in a cubby, even if it\u00b4s an empty bag that you are going to use for your purchase. I crocheted a cute tote to use for smaller purchases and was not happy about leaving it in the unattended cubby. I was not in the store for long, but when I went to check out it was gone. The store gave me a gift card for 2 dollars, that is all they will do.\n\nSo fast forward to yesterday, I saw a woman with my bag!! I KNOW it was my bag because I had added a flower that was not in the original pattern, and the yarn was a very distinct color. So I casually said to the woman, what a pretty bag, where did you get it, I would love to have one like it. Thinking maybe someone else stole it and gave it to her. But, no she said, oh, I made it myself. I didn\u00b4t say anything else because she had her kids with her.\n\nBut a few minutes later the kids had wandered off and I went back up to her and said, you know what, culera (asshole in Spanish) I know you stole that bag because I am the one who made it. I hope you enjoy it, but I took your picture and am going to burn you on the FB group we have here.\n\nShe just ignored me and took off, bag and all. I do have a picture of her, but I didn\u00b4t put it up yet. I told my husband what happened and he was mad at ME, that I should have just let it go.

Thief should be called out.", "NTA, ignore your husband. No thief should be casually tolerated. Glad you confronted her, and I definitely would put her on social media.", "NTA. How awful to have your handmade bag stolen.  If you make another bag or anything, try to put your initials on it somewhere or hey, there's name labels!  Maybe you could put a label with your name on it inside the bag, so if somebody stole your stuff again, you could report them to the cops and the bag would have your name to prove it's yours.", "NTA. Call her out. People around her deserve to know.", "Nope. I would've grabbed that bag off her shoulder and dumped all her shit straight on the ground. You're better than me.", "NTA\n\nI know it's only a crocheted bag but, do you have any concrete proof that it's yours (witnesses, videos, pictures)? I'm asking cause why not go the legal route?\n\nWhy use the trashy tribunal (aka Facebook) instead of the actual law?\nShe indeed stole it, and if it's not that long ago maybe the store still has the tape.\n\nYou should only use FB to identify her, crop the picture to only show her face and say some bogus story to help find her.", "No. Nta. Put the picture up", "So you confronted her and didn't take back your bag? What was the point? To look weak?", "NTA. Put her on BLAST.", "NTA. Why is she stealing unattended bags from a store she frequents often and not expecting to get caught at some point, especially in a small town? Her behavior is saying she\u2019s done this before and will again. At the very least, you should tell the store so they\u2019re aware of the behavior too (and maybe they\u2019ll change it to a better policy, like handing the bags to an employee behind the counter).", "NTA for the confrontation.  YWBTH of you posted it on FB", "NTA. But confronting strangers in public, even for their own terrible behavior could have them react in negative and potentially violent ways so be careful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You wouldn't be the Ahole but unless you live outside the USA, do NOT DO THAT. You will be the one humiliated and possibly charged in the end.

I could put up a picture and say someone took my bag my mistake at XYX store.

What I should have done is grab one of the police, show them the picture proving I made the bag and had them go over to her and make her give it to me.  Oh well.  I do feel better though, haha.", "Exactly! Good luck and I hope you get your bag back!!!"]}
