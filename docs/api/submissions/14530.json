I just want an outside opinion to know whether I need to suck it up and apologize or not.\n\nTwo weeks ago, my husband hurt himself pretty badly and ended up in the hospital. They held him for five days before we had to take him home. He was put on several different meds that have him so out of it, and the few days he's been home have been a lot of just trying to sleep and getting sick. \nI've just been trying to make him comfortable and keep things going. \n\nIn those days, I didn't tell his parents. Actually, while we were at the hospital I didn't call anyone but my mom. I know that sounds horrible, and I'm not sure what to say for myself.\nHe doesn't have a terrible relationship with his parents, but it's tense and they have never been very supportive or kind to him. They are condescending and impatient at their best, and I just don't think anyone can handle that right now. \nI only started making calls after we'd been home awhile, and I only told his sister, who must have called them. \n\nMy mother in law calls me incredibly upset, which I understand. I tried to apologize and and explain that I just thought having them both there would stress him out, but she just got more angry and hung up.\n\nI didn't hear from her again until yesterday when she showed up at our house pissed and demanding to see my husband.\nI said I was willing, but she needed to calm down and stop yelling. She got pushy and I threatened to call the cops until she left. \nBoth she and his father have called me saying how unfair it is I'm keeping their son from them, but I knew it was going to be like this. I'm just trying to keep their weird drama away from him until he can at least speak for himself.\nAm I out of line? Should I just apologize and let them have a few hours with him?

Once he's able to express his desires rationally, of course, ask him.  But until then, I say, go with your gut.  You know him better than anyone else does.

They would call it like it is you essentially medically kidnapped your husband and this would be borderline controlling and abusive. And everyone would tell him what a big red flag this is and she should leave him when she comes off the medication. But to me it doesn\u2019t matter that your a woman this is controlling and abusive and hopefully he see this when he is better and sees it for the big red flag it is.\n\nNo matter what at this point your in-laws will never forgive and rightfully so.

Perhaps he\u2019s a private person and the redit world is simply making unfair assumptions based on a very limited amount of information.

Also, if someone came to my house and got in my face, regardless of who they are, would need to call the police not the other way around. There\u2019s absolutely no reason to act that way.

Maybe you can say that you thought you'd asked the sister to pass the news along but apparently didn't in the stress of the moment.

I just want an outside opinion to know whether I need to suck it up and apologize or not.\n\nTwo weeks ago, my husband hurt himself pretty badly and ended up in the hospital. They held him for five days before we had to take him home. He was put on several different meds that have him so out of it, and the few days he's been home have been a lot of just trying to sleep and getting sick. \nI've just been trying to make him comfortable and keep things going. \n\nIn those days, I didn't tell his parents. Actually, while we were at the hospital I didn't call anyone but my mom. I know that sounds horrible, and I'm not sure what to say for myself.\nHe doesn't have a terrible relationship with his parents, but it's tense and they have never been very supportive or kind to him. They are condescending and impatient at their best, and I just don't think anyone can handle that right now. \nI only started making calls after we'd been home awhile, and I only told his sister, who must have called them. \n\nMy mother in law calls me incredibly upset, which I understand. I tried to apologize and and explain that I just thought having them both there would stress him out, but she just got more angry and hung up.\n\nI didn't hear from her again until yesterday when she showed up at our house pissed and demanding to see my husband.\nI said I was willing, but she needed to calm down and stop yelling. She got pushy and I threatened to call the cops until she left. \nBoth she and his father have called me saying how unfair it is I'm keeping their son from them, but I knew it was going to be like this. I'm just trying to keep their weird drama away from him until he can at least speak for himself.\nAm I out of line? Should I just apologize and let them have a few hours with him? I know I probably should, but I just know they'll just make things worse.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The first time I'd mentioned them, it kind of upset him. Then he'd said it would be ok if they came by, but that was when she came to the door raising all kinds of hell. He was aware she came to the door and he heard that exchange, and that really put him out of sorts. He didn't really know what was going on, and he hates when she gets pissed off like that.\nSo as far as if he would want them to be here, I just don't know. I think it could be nice if they could handle themselves, but I know that they just tend to stress him out.", "Yeah, I think a lot of people aren't reading the OP properly. \"Not a terrible relationship with his parents\" but also \"tense\" and all the rest.
