It was just him, again, I didn't care.\n\nThen my 18th birthday came, and he promised he would take me out to a Hello Kitty themed cafe I loved, I was so happy, my mom was happy for me too and even helped me pick a good outfit, I started waiting for him, but he didn't show up, I sent him messages asking where he is, but he didn't respond, I felt like I was 8 again.

I understand that you want a relationship with your father. But what you said to him is true. He is a terrible father that has caused an is still causing a lot of pain an do s nothing to resolve this or do better. You did not \u201eruin your relationship with him\u201c by saying this. There never was one because he only ever contacted you to feel better about himself. You are NTA. Think about going NC with him and try to move on. As painful as this might be now.", "He IS a terrible father.  At least now you have irrevocable, incontrovertible, irreversible evidence for your feelings.\n\nBlock this man on all avenues of communication and go No Contact.  Don't let even the thought of him tarnish your brain and your heart ever again.\n\nNTA", "NTA by any stretch. Just because he is your father doesn\u2019t mean you owe him anything. HE literally ruined the relationship and now feels guilt? Doesn\u2019t seem likely. Maybe someone else in his life is pushing him but I doubt he is. I had a parent like that and now I\u2019m a mom of 4. I would NEVER do that to any of my kids, and I\u2019m not with their dads. Then again I wouldn\u2019t have stopped seeing them to begin with, they\u2019re my babies (and their dads are the same way). This is the time to focus on who you are and starting to begin your life. You have to see the situation for what it is and set boundaries that you are comfortable with. Also therapy as parental desertion can be devastating with long term effects. Be well", "You didn't ruin your chances of having a father. You never had one to begin with. A sperm donor isn't a father and how much importance can you place on DNA (I mean, humans share 98 percent DNA similarity with pigs) when nothing else he does is fatherly in the slightest?\n\nThis might sound harsh but I'll give it to you straight: not all of us get dad's. Not all of us get good dad's. That's just how it is and you can have a great and fulfilling life regardless. His pathetic attitude was never and will never be your fault, his existence or lack thereof doesn't define you.\n\nYou're not crying over *him*. Nothing he's done is worth missing. You're crying over a concept (the loving father) but that's never been him. He abandoned you, let you down and ignored for the past 14 years.  He was the adult and it was his responsibility (and only his) to treat you properly. He didn't.\n\nMove on with your head held high.", "Definitely NTA, he and his wife are. I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re being treated like that. You don\u2019t deserve it at all. It\u2019s really hard when you\u2019re listening self involved ahs giving you a sob story or gaslighting you to not doubt yourself but you shouldn\u2019t, you were/are the child and you deserve a parent who is there for you, is interested in you and supports you. It\u2019s totally natural to want a relationship with your father but it may be wise to set some boundaries with him if you choose to continue a relationship in the future because \u201cwhen someone shows you who they are, believe them\u201d. Wishing you all the best!", "NTA\n\nEvery chance you gave him, after he broke off contact when you were still a child, was one more chance than he had any reasonable right to expect.  If he has not grasped by now that it\u2019s not about him and whatever struggles he\u2019s faced in life, it\u2019s about the daughter who was not responsible for any of those struggles, then sadly he\u2019s not going to get it.  I wish you all the best in building a happy life with the support of those family members who have chosen to be there with you.", "OMG, OP you are so NTA. Your dad has manipulated you your whole life and he hasn't been good enough to be a dogs butthole. Now he's all upset at the truth? That's his burden to bear, not yours. And his partner can back the f up. Block them all and focus on your own happiness without them, because in spite of his shocking behaviour, you were still willing to give him a chance that he didn't deserve - and that speaks more to your good character. Each time you let him back in he will just perpetuate the abusive cycle. You deserve better.", "Absolutely NTA. He's had more than enough chances and he failed every time.", "Yes he is. He really is.", "NTA. That\u2019s so awful. I really feel for you. You wish you had a loving father so much that you want to believe that man could be one, and you are frightened of there being a chance that you screwed up. He threw everything away and screwed up. He almost certainly won\u2019t change enough for there to be any chance to have what you want from him. Don\u2019t let him in emotionally or rely on him. He\u2019ll just let you down. You don\u2019t have to go full NC if that\u2019s not what you want, but you need to try and get to a place where you realise he\u2019s not trustworthy and can\u2019t be relied on, and he\u2019s the problem not you. And NC is something you should seriously consider because it will be easiest for you.", "NTA\n\nHow much more disappointment about your non existent father do you want to bear?\n\nHe was never your father.  He wasn't there for you and he basically abandoned you.  He doesn't get a free pass on any of this.\n\nYou need to grieve the loss of the father you never had.  You did nothing wrong but he did everything wrong.\n\nFocus your energy on the relationships that are supportive and make you feel good about yourself and let go of the toxic, unsupportive ones.\n\nTherapy will likely be valuable for this too.", "NTA.\n\nThe bare minimum a parent does is show up. Your dad couldn't even be bothered to do that. He ignored your existence, and then, when he finally decided to talk to you, he just used you to vent about his life. \n\nHe IS a terrible father. He wanted you to tell him he wasn't, but he is. He abandoned his child because of his own failings. I want to be clear: the reason he wasn't around isn't your fault. It was all him. \n\nNow, this is all your choice, but I'd actually send a message to his darling bride:\n\n\"Hi, stepmother. I was unhappy with our conversation earlier, and I wanted to clarify some things. It is not selfish for a child to want their father to be around. It is not selfish for me to expect him to show up when he says he will. It is not selfish of me to hold him accountable for being a terrible father. \n\nMy father has barely been around. For 8 years, he didn't even speak to me except to say that my grandmother had died. When he did get back in touch, it was so he could complain about his life. Never once has our relationship been about me. Never once has he thought about me or put me first. Imagine someone treating your child like that, and then imagine their spouse berating your child for being hurt that their dad wasn't around. \n\nDad can be hurt. I was hurt every time he didn't show up. I was hurt when he abandoned me and refused to speak to me. I am hurt that instead of apologising, he continues the same pattern. And I am hurt that you, stepmother, chose to attack me because I agreed with your husband that he is, in fact, a terrible father. He may have been a wonderful spouse to you and a father to your son, but I don't even really know him, and he certainly doesn't know me. He chose to leave me behind when he divorced my mother. He has not been a father to me. \n\nI will be blocking you after this. I refuse to have you attacking me because you feel that your husband abandoning me was a good thing, and that I'm selfish for actually wanting a father, and one who can actually be bothered to be around and care about me. You may think that his actions are acceptable and okay, but I don't. I miss the father I could have had, but I will not apologise to the father I've had, one who can't even do the bare minimum.\"\n\nYou deserve better than this, and none of it is your fault. The hardest part about situations like this is accepting that this is who your dad is, and that unless he does some real soul-searching and sincerely changes, he can't and won't give you the relationship you want and that you deserve. You have nothing to apologise for, and as much as it hurts, you would be better off letting go of your dad rather than continuing to be disappointed and hurt by him. It isn't that you've ruined your chances at a relationship, it's that he has by him continuing to be a selfish, pathetic excuse for a parent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
