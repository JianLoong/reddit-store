My boyfriend is from a fairly traditional family where his mum (46f)  was at one point a stay at home mother and did everything, at another point she had two jobs and also did all the domestic work while his dad (60m) would just work and do his hobbies. So he grew up in a family where gender roles are a big thing. \nI on the other hand grew up in a family where my parents did equal domestic work, and the women are as educated as the men. Sadly my father died but my mothers (58f) new husband (57m) is wonderful, for financial reasons they don\u2019t officially live together but mums partner does loads to help around the house even though he doesn\u2019t live at my mothers. \n\nI knew my boyfriend came from a very traditional family and it doesn\u2019t bother me as I knew he doesn\u2019t want that from me and is with me because he likes that I am my own person with a career.\n The thing is, I\u2019m getting older now and am not in a relationship for the giggles - my parents know this. My boyfriend and I have had many conversations about being properly serious, talk about marriage etc. so my parents are a little extra protective knowing my boyfriend and I\u2019s intentions. \n\nIt was after dinner and we were all talking, my mother and step dad were asking my boyfriend about his family and home life. My boyfriend jokes about how much work his mum does and how his dad does nothing, that she does all the chores, cooking, has no hobbies because she\u2019s so busy and how his dad has loads of hobbies and spends a lot of time with his friends. He was explaining this dynamic in such a positive manner, as though it\u2019s totally normal and a good thing. My whole family were visibly shocked and concerned, but my boyfriend kept going. The conversation ended there as no one knew what to say. I was mortified. My parents warned me that I might end up earning 50% of the income while doing all the chores, they said my boyfriend didn\u2019t seem to understand how unfair his mother has been treated. Etc\n\nSo I told my boyfriend that was embarrassing for me as it seemed he wasn\u2019t ashamed of the fact his father let his mother work, do all the domestic chores and have no time off. He was upset saying he\u2019s just proud of his parents who have worked hard to get where they are and haven\u2019t had it easy (both are immigrants and have worked so hard) but I respect how hard they work, in particular his mother. I don\u2019t respect how accepting he is of the fact his mother does everything while his father does nothing. \n\nSo aita for saying this is embarrassing?", "created_utc": 1704245130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18x6kyh/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_the_way_he_spoke/", "score": 1643, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At all. Learning that in front of your family certainly is awkward, but better embarrassed now than surprised about it one you\u2019re married and stuck with a man expecting to be waited on and catered to.\n\nThis is time for a big serious conversation and point out the major issues you have laid out here. If he really is defending his father\u2019s choices than it\u2019s time to move on.", "NTA for sharing how you feel and your parents are absolutely right, you will be expected to operate like his mom does. Bless", "NTA. This is not the guy for you. Move on. \n\nAlso, you are only 26 years old. You talk as if you have a slim window with which to find someone and settle down. That isn\u2019t true. You are ONLY 26 years old!\n\nDitch this guy and move on.", "NTA. It's great that he's proud of his parents, but he wasn't telling your parents how great they are or what he's proud of -- he was joking repeatedly about how his dad doesn't treat his mom well. Of course they were uncomfortable with that! Not only did it sound like he would do it to you, it also probably came across as criticizing your own parents' relationship.", "NTA and maybe your family's reaction will clue him in to the fact that his parents' marriage dynamic is toxic and potentially abusive. \n\nBut for you, I wouldn't move in with this guy unless and until he recognizes that. Because if he sees his parents' arrangement as acceptable, then don't be surprised if he springs the same views on you once you move in with him, as liberal and equal as he may claim to be now.", "Yeah, so this is a peek behind the mask", "NTA, but girrrrl, you just got a glimpse into what he sees as your future. Is this what you want?", "Nta. But... are you really so sure about what he would expect from you post marriage? Cause... he sounds awful unfazed by it... like he doesn't realize he just bragged about his mother having no life of her own and doesn't see a problem... have you actually had a discussion with him about what your relationship roles would look like long term? Or are you basing your beliefs that he doesn't want what his parents have on the fact that he's not pushing for it pre marriage?", "I think you might be the asshole here\u2026 but let me explain.  \n\nRelationships work both ways. Calling him out for supporting his parents is not fair on him - regardless of how they live, they are still his parents. I assume you would do the same for yours. \n\nThe way your family works is not necessarily the right way and the way your bf\u2019s family has operated (somewhat successfully it would seem? They\u2019ve obviously raised a fine young man for you to date?) isn\u2019t necessarily the wrong way. \n\nWhile I personally tend to agree with your families approach, many Australians have been brought up the way your bf was and to great effect, with happy and rewarding relationships. \n\nSure, maybe the father doesn\u2019t do enough chores, didn\u2019t cook or clean, but maybe he worked a lot to provide? Maybe he sacrificed his family time to work more and earn more to give his wife and kids a better life? Many fathers miss out on seeing their kids grow up because they are working to provide, it\u2019s a sacrifice often missed. To be clear, I\u2019m not defending or advocating for their lifestyle, just saying it can be a fair and equitable if done right, maybe they did?\n\nThis type of family arrangement was the dominant way of thinking for a very long time until recently. I would assume your parents were in the minority as far as their generation is concerned. Men were defined a lot by how they worked for their families and rightly or wrongly, it was the dominant ideology of the time. \n\nI\u2019m obviously just speculating, but I think these types of relationships rely heavily on mutual respect and understanding. Since his parents are still together (and I\u2019m assuming happy?), I\u2019m going to assume they have this mutual respect. To judge their way of living, which appears to be honest, harmless and effective, I think is unfair and might make you the asshole here. \n\nTo my original point - although your bf\u2019s family operates differently, it would appear they both deserve your respect, or at very least, your bf deserves to have his partner respect his parents. You don\u2019t have to like how they did things, but you also don\u2019t have to hate on it. And from what you\u2019ve said, it appears that he is more aligned with your family values, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to now disrespect him defending his parents. \n\nNote - I\u2019m not suggesting traditional gender roles are good or bad, just pointing out the differences and how they can be both positive and negative. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole or a bad person, but by the terms of this thread then I have to say you are! Perhaps you could have handled this situation better, but either way I hope it works out for you both!", "Well now you're going into this relationship knowing that he has these expectations of a future dynamic.", "I'm not sure how to  judge this, but I think you unearthed a mismatch. The issue isn't so much being embarrassed but that your boyfriend might try to do this in your future.\n\nWhy does the mother work two jobs and does all the housework while the father works one and has leisure time? To me, this isn't a traditional household if the woman is doing a lot of paid work and the man not as much. The division of housework- yes- but not this other stuff.", " We get it , saw your other post, you hate your bf. Why even post, just break up already.", "I'm not sure you're an AH but you went about this wrong. Have you and your boyfriend not had a serious conversation about his family, your future, and the kind of relationship you want to have? You say he doesn't want to replicate his parents' gender dynamics in his own future marriage, but it also sounds like he doesn't see anything wrong with what they have, and that's normal to him -- only one of those things can be true. You're focusing on the wrong thing here, you shouldn't be embarrassed so much as worried that you're not actually on the same page with this man about what you want your lives to look like. And if you are on the same page and he shares your concerns, give him some grace, he might have been trying to keep things light and funny when asked about his family, and just gone about it wrong.", "[removed]", "NTA spoiler: he wants this for you and as soon as you are a mom, he expects you to stop being your own person with a career. After all, you are a mom now", "I hope you didn't tell your boyfriend he should be ashamed of his family, which is the way it came across in your post,  if so then you're definitely the arsehole. You expect your boyfriend to respect your nontraditional upbringing but then tell him he should be ashamed because his family is traditional. I was raised in a very traditional household as well, my mom was a SAHM while my dad worked. She pretty much ran the household and raised us while my dad worked outside the home, this was the dynamic that worked for our family.  Just because it doesn't work for you or your family doesn't mean you should try to shame others, stop being so judgemental.", "You're never TA for discussing how something made you feel, or even for feeling a certain way.\n\n\nThat said. I think you had the wrong conversation with him.  Instead of saying how much he embarrassed you, you probably should have discussed what his intentions were with you in terms of gender roles.\n\nIs his mom miserable in her role? Are they happy together? Does that dynamic work for them? Because if that's the life she wants to live and you chose to make him feel bad for speaking positively about his parents then that makes YTA.  He grew up with his family, with that dynamic, that's what he knows and if his parents are happy with that arrangement, and he's told you that he wants to do more than his dad does and he was sincere, then it's nobody's business to say that they're wrong and you can just carry on being embarrassed.", "It might just be a dynamic that they're happy with. My partner and I have totally different workloads, but it's because it's torturous for him to sit still and he likes cleaning and cooking. I do any of the things he hates doing, and if he ever indicates that he doesn't wanna do something,  I'll take over", "Everybody is for cultural diversity until it conflicts with their beliefs.  BF's parents have their own marriage and it seems to be working for them. i come from an immigrant family too and it's frustrating when people look down on our ways. I know this is not the cultural norm in the west, but a little understanding goes a long ways.  \n\nas far as OP's relationship they should break up. BF has not said he wants the same marriage as his parents.  OP and her family are cultural snobs and it will not work out in the long run.\n\n\nYTA", "What you\u2019re failing to see is the cultural differences between you two. It may be deeper than just gender roles in a relationship.", "YTA. Just because it wasn\u2019t your norm growing up doesn\u2019t mean it was normal for him. He wasn\u2019t indicating that he would expect you to be like his mother either so you\u2019re all overreacting.", "Boyfriend was honest about his parents and clearly sees the work disparity.  He also loves his parents and isn\u2019t going to go around criticizing them in front of strangers.  He has shown his girlfriend nothing in their relationship or discussions to indicate he isn\u2019t a 50/50 guy.  Reddit immediately advised girl to dump him for bring honest, respecting and loving his parents, and treating his girlfriend as an equal.  Maybe the standards are a bit too specific.", "Yta. You and your family dont have the right to judge how family dynamics work. You dont know how his mother feels about her role. A lot of couples are happy living a traditional lifestyle and others are happy in a more modern relationship. Different dynamics work for different people. Neither dynamic is wrong or right, its person specific. \n\nIts wrong of your family to make such harsh judgments towards your boyfriend for speaking the truth about his family situation. And its horrible for you to tell your boyfriend that he's embarrassed you for speaking the truth. You and your family sound very judgmental. If i were your boyfriend, I wouldn't be comfortable around your family anymore and would question the future of our relationship.\n\nEdit* i just read the comments and im genuinely shocked at how many nta's there are. Some claiming traditional families are abusive. Reddit is really wild.", "The bro was asked a straight question and answered it honestly. His family dynamics come from somewhere and he is (obviously) \u2018tainted\u2018 by them. \n\nAre you sure the two of you are compatible?

He -NOT- seeing how his father\u2019s abundant time for his hobbies and friends is fundamentally -unfair- given he has those, due to his mom working herself to the bone is beyond concerning. \n\nYour mom and her partner are right, and their experiences are telling them what you will be looking forward to, listen to them. \n\nNta", "Both you and your family have to accept that other families do things differently and are happy in their ways no matter what you think of it.

It\u2019s none of your business what his family dynamic is and if it works for them then why is it your place to shit all over it", "NTA. It sounds like your boyfriend was essentially making sexist jokes about his own mother. That is embarrassing. However, I think you should maybe be less worried that he\u2019s embarrassed himself in front of your parents and more worried that you might be dating a misogynist.", "If his mom earned all the money, this isn\u2019t about traditional gender roles at all. His dad is just useless.

They like doing work and they don't want help. Does his mom choose this? It seems odd to most of us, but a small percentage of people this is where they find purpose in life. My boss is this way, he's a workaholic. He tells me how his wife wants him to relax more, but he's happy working. He rarely seems burnt out or overworked. It's just how some people are.\n\nI would also ask if your boyfriend expects a similar power dynamic? There's lots of speculation and assumptions, but why not ask this directly? I feel like that's the main concern. \n\nIf anything, though, your boyfriend should be more self aware of how the situation sounds to those who don't know his parents.", "NTA but that's really not as important as making it clear now that you're not interested in that kind of one-sided relationship", "I'm troubled by you feeling \"embarrassed\" and focusing in such an irrelevant element of the situation.

You need to know where this guy falls in the way he sees a future with you.\nI was always the more dominant personality between my husband and I but I brought him out of his shell a lot and taught him how to challenge me, he has always been respectful of me so I was never worried about how he had seen his parents relationship. \nAs I say you need to talk this through with him, it is great that he is proud of his parents, as long as he doesn\u2019t think he wants a relationship exactly the same and can see the flaws too.", "NTA.

My boyfriend is from a fairly traditional family where his mum (46f)  was at one point a stay at home mother and did everything, at another point she had two jobs and also did all the domestic work while his dad (60m) would just work and do his hobbies. So he grew up in a family where gender roles are a big thing. \nI on the other hand grew up in a family where my parents did equal domestic work, and the women are as educated as the men. Sadly my father died but my mothers (58f) new husband (57m) is wonderful, for financial reasons they don\u2019t officially live together but mums partner does loads to help around the house even though he doesn\u2019t live at my mothers. \n\nI knew my boyfriend came from a very traditional family and it doesn\u2019t bother me as I knew he doesn\u2019t want that from me and is with me because he likes that I am my own person with a career.\n The thing is, I\u2019m getting older now and am not in a relationship for the giggles - my parents know this. My boyfriend and I have had many conversations about being properly serious, talk about marriage etc. so my parents are a little extra protective knowing my boyfriend and I\u2019s intentions. \n\nIt was after dinner and we were all talking, my mother and step dad were asking my boyfriend about his family and home life. My boyfriend jokes about how much work his mum does and how his dad does nothing, that she does all the chores, cooking, has no hobbies because she\u2019s so busy and how his dad has loads of hobbies and spends a lot of time with his friends. He was explaining this dynamic in such a positive manner, as though it\u2019s totally normal and a good thing. My whole family were visibly shocked and concerned, but my boyfriend kept going. The conversation ended there as no one knew what to say. I was mortified. My parents warned me that I might end up earning 50% of the income while doing all the chores, they said my boyfriend didn\u2019t seem to understand how unfair his mother has been treated. Etc\n\nSo I told my boyfriend that was embarrassing for me as it seemed he wasn\u2019t ashamed of the fact his father let his mother work, do all the domestic chores and have no time off. He was upset saying he\u2019s just proud of his parents who have worked hard to get where they are and haven\u2019t had it easy (both are immigrants and have worked so hard) but I respect how hard they work, in particular his mother. I don\u2019t respect how accepting he is of the fact his mother does everything while his father does nothing. \n\nSo aita for saying this is embarrassing?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is about effort. No relationship is ever truly 50/50. It doesn't matter that his mom does more cleaning or cooking. What matters is that his dad does nothing.

What's not fine is that he's sitting around all day and putting in zero effort anywhere. \n\nI read in some of the other comments you pay for most things. Bad sign.

If she's ok with it (maybe she loves the father like a kid), you don't get to judge unless your ok with being an asshole. If she hates it, you do get to pick a side & this point becomes moot).\n2. NTA - You might need to have a proper chat with your boyfriend & set a proper rule for the future. Example, due to previous bad experiences with parents of girlfriends before, I told my then gf & now wife (of 12 years), if the parents make her choose between us or them, who's side will she take, after giving her some time, she said she would choose me for which I told her that I will always treat her like they are as much my family as my own (I even call them father & mother as well) & will try my level best never to let it come to that even in future, so far so good. Another rule imposed to her was that when I grew up, my family always had fights, esp with my dad being the asshole who wants to suppress my mom yet get her to do everything for him & at my wife's place, her mom was the boss (also yelling at everyone in the house) even if the father was the earner.. My wife though seems docile has a rather loud mouth esp with her mom & sister.. I told my wife that even if we have fights, we will not be yelling at each other ever (well as long as our brains work) cos I can raise my voice much louder than her or anyone else we know.. And so far, we don't really have big loud fights EVER. (We've had a few but very very rare & recover very fast)..\n\nAlso we try to admit wrong doing as soon as possible even if it means it's at the cost of ego.. Cos at the end of the day, I love her & she loves me.. We are in this together.. Our parents WILL die, our siblings & kids will find their own partners or just grow different (plus all of them are directly connected to us & don't have much of a choice in that aspect of the relationships) but the significant other chooses to be with us & they can choose otherwise if we loose that connection.

An older woman shared this with me and I will pass it on to you - divide the chores FROM the start. Example, in my case, I am always responsible for the laundry (but he folds and puts away his own clothes) and he is always responsible for the trash. Before we got a cleaner, I set the rule that he was responsible for cleaning the three bathrooms (which he is REALLY good at) and I was responsible for cleaning the three bedrooms plus living room (all of which were easy to do because we keep rooms clean. I mostly vacuumed and dusted). We took turns cooking, though I am the one who got stuck with meal planning all the time. But one person cooks, the other person cleans. That last only worked for a short while because my husband tends to use every dish in the house to make a meal and leaves the kitchen a disaster. Meanwhile, I clean as I cook and use the minimum amount of dishes to cook. So now, we cook and clean after ourselves. I do NOT pick up after him or take over chores. He is not the best at cleaning the kitchen. So I send him back in there to finish the job. If you take over, you run the risk of him weaponizing his incompetence. We don't have children (by choice), so we don't have to worry about that. But if you do have kids, you can adjust the division of chores accordingly. Hold him to it and live with him BEFORE marriage. That'll give you some idea what you are in for. I've lived alone until my now husband moved in with me a year before marriage. From that experience, I learned that I really miss having my own space. So I made sure to have my own bathroom and one of the bedrooms is my room to escape into when I need space.\n\nMen will often believe they are pulling their weight, but you will have to make sure that they are. My husband has no issues with doing his part, though he does procrastinate and that drives me nuts. Lol\n\nAlso, I know a few men who grew up in households like that (my husband included) who absolutely did not expect traditional gender roles. It is possible that your bf is being truthful and also possible that you will live in an equal household with him. You two just have to learn how to live with each other and modify behaviors when needed. But you first need to have a talk with him about expectations (both of yours) and you both need to live it to see it in action.", "Well. Does he treat you unequal?", "You need to stop all of this.

So saying it was embarrassing, while it doesn't make you an asshole because it's how you felt, hence my judgment, may not be the best way of going about this. \n\nOne place to start is to ask him how he'd feel if he had a daughter who, at the age of 21, was having a child with someone almost twice her age, and was doing all the chores and childcare. Because while the dynamic right now may be normal and what he's used to, going back to the beginning might help him open his eyes as to the reality of the situation.", "So he\u2019s actually behaving exactly like his father already, not even capable of doing his part of the \u201ctraditional gender roles\u201d he thinks are so great.", "You should give him an example of what his mom does.

We do an incredible job balancing each other out and picking up the slack for each other, but like every couple we still have disagreements/arguments.  You know what bothers her the most?

Also it sounds like he has a lot of admiration for his father - which is fine - but he should also be very critical of his father as well.  Doesn\u2019t sound like he is.  Another huge red flag.

We have a child together, and we don't have traditional gender roles at home. But even I tend to sometimes joke about it within his family, because it's sometimes tragically funny.\nFor example, his father can't cook, like at all. He can scramble an egg and make tea so that he can have tea, yogurt, and bread for a meal...\nSo the mother gets corona, and she becomes very sick, and she can't cook or barely move. So he needs to step up. And it's SO overwhelming for him, he's like \"I have no clue what I am doing, and there's pots and pans and mess all over, it's so frustrating to so the dishes too!\". He man has been retired for 10-15 years and does very little in his everyday..\nThe mother is super frustrated, calls to complain, and ends up going to her sister's so she can get some proper food and care.\nAs soon as she is well again, we talk on the phone, and she complains to me that her son (my husband) does too much of the cooking, and that I should take over and do the cooking! I'm like, it's good that your son can cook, so I will never end up in the same situation if I get ill. And she's just like \"oh but he's my baby boy, he shouldn't have to cook. \" ...\nI mean... I can't help but laugh about the absolute willingness to keep up the patriarchy. The mother definitely sees the benefits of me working (so her son and her herself benefit from the money), but absolutely no benefits of us sharing the household burden.\nMy husband's sister (they all still leave in their home country) did a bare minimum (didn't like cooking, did a little bit of cleaning in a two-room-apartment and did the dishes) from the time she left school (own choice) at 16 and got married at 25. His brother studied, couldn't use the education for anything and did hard labour, and worked a lot to support the family.\nOften, the women are the victims (especially in retirement age!), but sometimes the men are also the victims under this very divided form of patriarchy.\nAnyway, none of it affects my husband's position on gender roles in our home. He's more modern than most western men I know still.", "It sounds like you want to be optimistic about the results of this discussion. But people with views like your boyfriend's can change for a few weeks or months but eventually fall back to their original habits.

I'm sorry.", "As a woman who is a few years older than you, it's just so fucking frustrating to see younger women give soo much benefit of the doubt to men like this. If he doesn't actually understand what \"equal\" means in his mid 20s, why do you think he will understand by the time you get married? Doing chores together and respecting your partner regardless of gender are not some rocket science level of concepts.

Believe what he said to your family, not that he wants equality.", "If he wanted an equal relationship he would NOT have been speaking like that about his mother and father. He would be horrified thinking about his poor mother and disgusted at his father.", "Go by his actions, not his words. You are already paying for the dates. You are taking more care of him and then he's taking care of you.", "Uh. Houston you have a problem that will only get worse", "So - are you sure when he says he wants an equal relationship, that isn't just talking about the money side of things?\n\nAnd - was he actually bragging about his dad? because deep down, he thinks that is cool?\n\nyou keep saying you'll teach him if he's willing to learn.

Maybe she doesn't feel that she does \"all the work\" and feels like a respected member of her home and community. It's 100% white feminism to make judgements about a woman without her own voice in the story. OP does not know this woman.

Our kid moved to another country last year and he refused to come with to help and did not do anything to help w logistics or prep. We\u2019re moving across the country and all of that logistics labor - finding and hiring everyone, clearing out our stuff, finding all new there, finding a short-term rental, real estate agent and upgrades on our current house - that\u2019s me.
