She basically grew up in a family where she was pretty much forced to watch Indian movies for pretty much most of her childhood, and by the time she moved out, she told me she never wanted to see a Bollywood movie again. I(20M) didn't really have a problem with this because I've never really seen an Indian Movie aside from a funny clip featuring fight scenes with ridiculous gravity-defying over the top fight scenes.\n\nThat is until one of my friends showed me this movie called RRR. This was the first time I really sat down and watched an Indian movie from start to finish. It was definitely not what I was expecting, it was an incredibly fun and enjoyable experience, and nowhere throughout the movie did I feel like it was melodramatic or over the top, it was a wonderful experience.\n\nI really wanted to show it to my girlfriend as I thought she might make an exception to this one, but to my surprise, she said she doesn't care how much I thought I liked it, she refuses to watch it. I tried again, but she just flat out told me no and refused to even entertain the possibility of discussion.\n\nThis all happened last month. Personally, I think she's being incredibly close-minded and judgemental, which is a really harmful attitude, like I would usually defer to her to South Asian culture, but in this issue, I think she's being super adamant. \n\nSo last week, for her birthday, I told her I planned a surprise party with all her friends, where we go to the bowling alley, get a few drinks, and then come back and watch a movie. I didn't tell her the movie was RRR and when she found out, she seemed fine in front of everyone, we all really enjoyed the movie, but when everyone left, she told me that what I did was a dick move.

Are you truly completely unfamiliar with empathy?\n\nShe told you she doesn't ever want to watch any movie ever and she told you why (it was forced on her through her childhood).\n\nYou ignored her wishes and used her birthday (a day to celebrate her) to force her to sit through an Indian movie and you made sure she was surrounded by other people so she would not feel comfortable refusing. \n\nYou forced her to watch an Indian movie. After she said she didn't want to watch Indian movies because people used to force her to watch Indian movies. Did you really and honestly think it would make her love it if you forced her?
