I've met the bride and groom a few times, he has known them for decades.\n\nThere is a local tradition for each guest to bring a dozen cookies to the wedding, then at the wedding everybody's cookies are displayed together to make a cookie table. We wanted to participate, so we baked cookies the night before.\n\nI have a very beautiful and expensive tea tray. Boyfriend suggested that I use it to display the cookies. I said no, it's a 300-person wedding, I don't want some auntie \"accidentally\" taking it home with her. Boyfriend seemed fine with this, we found a simple bowl that was perfectly appropriate for the occasion, and used that to display the cookies.\n\nAfter the wedding as we were preparing to leave and I went to retrieve my bowl, boyfriend told the newlyweds that I didn't want to use my tea tray because I thought one of their guests might steal it. I tried to backtrack by saying that I just didn't want it to get misplaced or damaged, but he \"called me out on lying.\" The newlyweds said something about everyone there being friends and family, it was very awkward and we left shortly.\n\nI am angry because I told him that in confidence and he should have known better than to repeat that to his friends, even though they were very close.\n\nExample of cookie table (photo from the internet): https://youngstownlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Cookie-Table-576x768.jpg  \nThe tea tray: https://www.wedgwood.com/en-us/dinnerware/dinnerware/all-dinnerware/wild-strawberry-sandwich-tray-40001789  \nThe bowl: https://www.target.com/p/36oz-stoneware-avesta-dinner-bowls-project-62/-/A-82614212?preselect=53516997#lnk=sametab", "created_utc": 1689106730, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x28sf/aita_for_saying_that_i_dont_want_an_expensive/", "score": 211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your BF was a bit crass in bringing up your concern, IMHO.", "Your boyfriend is a jerk. \n\nAnd this shit DOES happen. I loaned my very perfect and expensive silver tea service for a wedding. As I was in the wedding, I didn't see what they were up to until it was too late. \n\nSomeone took my service off the tray, and used a carving knife to cut up meat and cheese on the tray. gouging huge score marks all over it. It is ruined. \n\nSo NTA for wanting your property to be protected, but I would seriously consider if you want to be in a relationship with someone who would do you dirty like that.", "NTA, but your man sure is! No more cookies for him until he learns to behave better in public.", "NTA. Ur bfs an idiot and should learn to self regulate.

It is super easy for someone to walk off with the wrong tray in a situation like this- it is absolutely common sense to take something you don\u2019t mind being broken or lost! Your BF is an ass, clearly doesn\u2019t own anything he\u2019s worried about losing, and has no respect for your belongings. Seriously- what he did was a total dick move and literally only served ONE purpose, which hugely telling. His sole purpose was making you look bad- why would you want to be with someone who would do that?!?!??", "NTA\n\nFirst, its your property. You get to decide how and when it's used. \n\nSecond, it doesn't matter if its friends and family. I've been to plenty of weddings and I've seen people act like real assholes.

You are well within your rights to bring something less expensive to put the cookies in than some antique old or even family heirloom you cared about.  He should of respected that and he shouldn't have broken your confidence.  The man is an idiot and sounds completely socially awkward.", "NTA. Your boyfriend most definitely is the AH.

I got a ring stolen at a birthday party with friends and family... So you never know", "NTA what could possibly be accomplished by him saying that? He didn\u2019t have to tell them about the tea tray at all and even then why does it bleeding matter if you fudge the truth and say misplaced or damaged when those would obviously equally be your fears along with the stealing.", "NTA but man is your BF a big ole dumb dumb. What did he accomplish by telling the bride and groom that? Then he double downed when you tried to play it off. We would definitely fight on the car ride home haha.", "NTA.\n\nHe wanted you to take a Wedgewood piece out of your house? To a large gathering? That\u2019s enough to know he\u2019s in the wrong. The socially awkward follow up with the bride and groom is also problematic- only you can say whether it\u2019s accidental or mean-spirited.", "NTA. Why would your boyfriend even bring it up to them other than to make you look bad?", "NTA. Dollar Tree dishes are my go to source for potluck dishes, I often add serving utensils and just don't even worry about bringing anything home.

Just because the bride and and groom know everyone and \"trust\" everyone doesn't mean they are worthy of trust. Also, You don't know anyone or have to trust anyone! They can all suck eggs.

There are things you say inside a couple that don't go outside the couple.", "NTA. \n\nYour boyfriend is a big AH though. \n\nOf course you don't want to bring an expensive item to a big gathering where you don't know most people, you don't know the set up, and you worry the item could get taken or even just misplaced. \n\nYou should ask your boyfriend what he hoped to accomplish by telling them you said that. And that when he saw it created an awkward moment, why did he feel it was important to make sure they knew you were \"lying.\" Ask him to explain why he said it, and why he thinks it is okay to share information like that in general. Be clear, that he is setting the standard for your relationship- going out to a party where his friend's girlfriend is annoying and he mentions that to you- it is okay to tell them. His mother says something he didn't like and he tells you- totally okay to tell her! \n\nWe need to be able to say small things like this to our partner, knowing it is a trusted space. You hurt no one by worrying about the tray and not using it. NO ONE. But your boyfriend did hurt his friends and broke your trust by feeling it was important to share those thoughts.", "NTA. Your boyfriend on the other hand\u2026", "Nta. This is something that would be a deal breaker for a relationship.", "NTA, your boyfriend is obtuse. \n\nWhen there are a bunch of empty plates, with all the cookies gone it\u2019s super easy to forget which serving plate you brought to the wedding. \n\nOr \u201cforget\u201d\n\nFrankly, all the guests probably had the same idea you did it\u2019s just your boyfriend was the only one tactless enough to say it outloud and to the hosts.", "NTA.

In less than 30mins there was a monstrously huge rug missing. One of the brides maids and boyfriend drove thier truck through the garden...(not a road or path)..rolled the carpet up stuck it in the baclk and tried to make thier getaway. They got stuck in the mud several hundreds of yards away. \n\nThw thief  was considered famaly too. You were super reasonable and smart not to bring something you value to a big event like that.

In my experience the people that act most offended by the suggestion of stealing end up being thieves. Other people understand the worry.", "Nta- I used to brush off my ex doing me dirty like this. Until I realized it's actually a subtle sabotage.  He slowly went around and made people hate me by his little whispers or uncouth behavior.

I decorate those eggs nicely with a piping bag.  They get jostled around in any other container. Anyway NTA. No one is going to care of and understand the value of something except you.

You said it, then when you explained it in the post you reiterated that you thought it would be stolen, not misplaced, with some auntie walking off with it. You suck because that IS what you thought would happen, which is a weird way to go in the first place.

Very clearly, everyone sucks here.", "And even if the couple can vouch 100% for every guest- how many staff members are in and out of the venue for a 300 person wedding?", "My SIL tried to steal every table centerpiece.", "Agreed. My mom had so many items stolen from her at family gatherings and church potlucks. (She even had hand towels stolen from her because she used them to line the carrier she put her casserole dish in.) \n\n I learned growing up that you only bring disposable or cheap dishes to potlucks so you won't miss it if its stolen. \n\nPlenty of sticky fingers roam around at social functions. Cookware is expensive, and people are awful.", "NTA. Ever since my mom threw out my stainless steel pie dish, which a friend gave me, because she thought it was disposable, I\u2019ve only used either disposable aluminum or reusable but cheap dishes when bringing dessert to anyone. I can\u2019t even imagine risking Wedgwood.", "NTA.

We kept 2 and donated the rest to a local nursing home.", "I don\u2019t deny the boyfriend is a totally idiot and clearly the asshole here, but this is a bit of a Reddit reply.", "Calm down.", "Just get a tray from a thrift store", "Also what a weird thing to say to try and get a chuckle, the way he said it seems like he was trying to offend them to me. Why put in their mind, I\u2019m their wedding day, that his gf didn\u2019t want to being something in case it got taken BY ACCIDENT/in the shuffle of things, but leave out the by accident part", "Also Replacements.com", "People do steal things or \"take\" them by accident. My first day at work someone took my coke that I put in the fridge. OP isn't literally calling people out as thieves, she's just aware of this potential risk.", "Yeah. No. Two silver cake slices went missing at my wedding. Suspects were friends, family and hotel staff. Very uncomfortable. Learned my lesson.", "Nope. Op was being realistic about a very reasonable concern. Nta.", "That\u2019s not being an AH, it\u2019s being realistic. Plenty of people have various stories of things getting taken, stolen, misplaced. She wasn\u2019t calling anyone out specifically, and no one in their right mind would get offended over this. I would personally ask everyone to bring a throwaway dish to ensure this very thing wouldn\u2019t happen if I was the bride or groom.\n\nIt\u2019s still incredibly awkward for the boyfriend to say this and then double down. He\u2019s the only AH here.", "Good call."]}
