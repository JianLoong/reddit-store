We wanted to participate, so we baked cookies the night before.\n\nI have a very beautiful and expensive tea tray. Boyfriend suggested that I use it to display the cookies. I said no, it's a 300-person wedding, I don't want some auntie \"accidentally\" taking it home with her. Boyfriend seemed fine with this, we found a simple bowl that was perfectly appropriate for the occasion, and used that to display the cookies.\n\nAfter the wedding as we were preparing to leave and I went to retrieve my bowl, boyfriend told the newlyweds that I didn't want to use my tea tray because I thought one of their guests might steal it. I tried to backtrack by saying that I just didn't want it to get misplaced or damaged, but he \"called me out on lying.\" The newlyweds said something about everyone there being friends and family, it was very awkward and we left shortly.\n\nI am angry because I told him that in confidence and he should have known better than to repeat that to his friends, even though they were very close.\n\nExample of cookie table (photo from the internet): https://youngstownlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Cookie-Table-576x768.jpg  \nThe tea tray: https://www.wedgwood.com/en-us/dinnerware/dinnerware/all-dinnerware/wild-strawberry-sandwich-tray-40001789  \nThe bowl: https://www.target.com/p/36oz-stoneware-avesta-dinner-bowls-project-62/-/A-82614212?preselect=53516997#lnk=sametab", "created_utc": 1689106730, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x28sf/aita_for_saying_that_i_dont_want_an_expensive/", "score": 5435, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were correct in using something you could live without if it got lost in the shuffle.  Your BF was a bit crass in bringing up your concern, IMHO.", "Your boyfriend is a jerk. \n\nAnd this shit DOES happen. I loaned my very perfect and expensive silver tea service for a wedding. As I was in the wedding, I didn't see what they were up to until it was too late. \n\nSomeone took my service off the tray, and used a carving knife to cut up meat and cheese on the tray. gouging huge score marks all over it. It is ruined. \n\nSo NTA for wanting your property to be protected, but I would seriously consider if you want to be in a relationship with someone who would do you dirty like that.", "NTA, but your man sure is! No more cookies for him until he learns to behave better in public.", "NTA. Ur bfs an idiot and should learn to self regulate. What a way to ruin the sentiment by blurting out totally unnecessary comments and then doubling down. Next time your out w friends, feel free to share his worries about his ED.", "You\u2019re NTA but your boyfriend sure is. What exactly was he trying to accomplish in this scenario besides embarrassing you?", "NTA. It is super easy for someone to walk off with the wrong tray in a situation like this- it is absolutely common sense to take something you don\u2019t mind being broken or lost! Your BF is an ass, clearly doesn\u2019t own anything he\u2019s worried about losing, and has no respect for your belongings. Seriously- what he did was a total dick move and literally only served ONE purpose, which hugely telling. His sole purpose was making you look bad- why would you want to be with someone who would do that?!?!??", "NTA\n\nFirst, its your property. You get to decide how and when it's used. \n\nSecond, it doesn't matter if its friends and family. I've been to plenty of weddings and I've seen people act like real assholes.

If the answer is \"no\" then mine would have been as well.", "NTA.  There's no way I would leave Wedgwood out where any rando (and that includes staff) could take it.

What did he go say something stupid like that for?  Completely uncalled for, completely unncessary!  You are well within your rights to bring something less expensive to put the cookies in than some antique old or even family heirloom you cared about.  He should of respected that and he shouldn't have broken your confidence.  The man is an idiot and sounds completely socially awkward.", "NTA. Your boyfriend most definitely is the AH.

I\u2019m assuming if I bring something to an event that big, it\u2019s no longer mine.

Why would your bf put you in an awkward position like that? He is TA for sure.", "NTA- it's perfectly reasonable to want to protect your nice tea tray.

A fine Pittsburgh tradition continues  (the cookie table).  Your bf is a putz. Cookies aren't the only thing he wouldn't be getting", "NTA but your boyfriend is. Does he knock you down to make himself look good in other situations?", "NTA, that's not something you repeat and as someone that has had \"close family\" steal from me, it's completely logical that you didn't want to use your nicer tray. \n\nYour partner is the AH here considering he put you on the spot like that for no reason, it must have been so awkward and now that couple will have an opinion of you, and if the chatty partner is any indication of how they are, others will also hear about the tray incident.\n\nI'm sorry you had to go thru that, I can't imagine how awkward it must've been", "NTA you never know. I got a ring stolen at a birthday party with friends and family... So you never know", "NTA what could possibly be accomplished by him saying that? He didn\u2019t have to tell them about the tea tray at all and even then why does it bleeding matter if you fudge the truth and say misplaced or damaged when those would obviously equally be your fears along with the stealing.", "NTA but man is your BF a big ole dumb dumb. What did he accomplish by telling the bride and groom that? Then he double downed when you tried to play it off. We would definitely fight on the car ride home haha.", "NTA.\n\nHe wanted you to take a Wedgewood piece out of your house? To a large gathering? That\u2019s enough to know he\u2019s in the wrong. The socially awkward follow up with the bride and groom is also problematic- only you can say whether it\u2019s accidental or mean-spirited.", "NTA. Why would your boyfriend even bring it up to them other than to make you look bad?", "NTA. Dollar Tree dishes are my go to source for potluck dishes, I often add serving utensils and just don't even worry about bringing anything home. Your boyfriend is an ass for deliberately introducing conflict where it wasn't needed.", "NTA, but the boyfriend is a bit. I think he was trying to be funny, but it just comes off as a bit crass.", "What a dick throws u under the bus nta but he is", "NTA.\n\n\nYour partner is, 100%. Just because the bride and and groom know everyone and \"trust\" everyone doesn't mean they are worthy of trust. Also, You don't know anyone or have to trust anyone! They can all suck eggs. I'd have never brought my good tea service to someone's random wedding, that's staying home where it's safe and insured. There are things you say inside a couple that don't go outside the couple.", "NTA. \n\nYour boyfriend is a big AH though. \n\nOf course you don't want to bring an expensive item to a big gathering where you don't know most people, you don't know the set up, and you worry the item could get taken or even just misplaced. \n\nYou should ask your boyfriend what he hoped to accomplish by telling them you said that. And that when he saw it created an awkward moment, why did he feel it was important to make sure they knew you were \"lying.\" Ask him to explain why he said it, and why he thinks it is okay to share information like that in general. Be clear, that he is setting the standard for your relationship- going out to a party where his friend's girlfriend is annoying and he mentions that to you- it is okay to tell them. His mother says something he didn't like and he tells you- totally okay to tell her! \n\nWe need to be able to say small things like this to our partner, knowing it is a trusted space. You hurt no one by worrying about the tray and not using it. NO ONE. But your boyfriend did hurt his friends and broke your trust by feeling it was important to share those thoughts.", "NTA. Your boyfriend on the other hand\u2026", "Nta. This is something that would be a deal breaker for a relationship.", "NTA, your boyfriend is obtuse. \n\nWhen there are a bunch of empty plates, with all the cookies gone it\u2019s super easy to forget which serving plate you brought to the wedding. \n\nOr \u201cforget\u201d\n\nFrankly, all the guests probably had the same idea you did it\u2019s just your boyfriend was the only one tactless enough to say it outloud and to the hosts.", "NTA.

In less than 30mins there was a monstrously huge rug missing. One of the brides maids and boyfriend drove thier truck through the garden...(not a road or path)..rolled the carpet up stuck it in the baclk and tried to make thier getaway. They got stuck in the mud several hundreds of yards away. \n\nThw thief  was considered famaly too. You were super reasonable and smart not to bring something you value to a big event like that. Not only can it be stolen but it can easily be damaged or innocent mistakes can make it lost.\n\nSorry your bd embarrassed you at the event.. that must have been a devestating moment anfter a long beautiful day.", "NTA but damn your boyfriend is a shit stirring little asshole.", "My ex used to do this kind of thing and I honestly did not get any of my things returned! In my experience the people that act most offended by the suggestion of stealing end up being thieves. Other people understand the worry.", "Nta- I used to brush off my ex doing me dirty like this. Until I realized it's actually a subtle sabotage.  He slowly went around and made people hate me by his little whispers or uncouth behavior.

Get away from him quickly", "NTA I hope your boyfriend was at least drunk to excuse some of his assholery", "NTA. I would have done the same thing as you. But, my husband wouldn't have said anything.

Why did he say anything about the tray at all? NTA but your bf is a major one.", "I was mad someone threw away my deviled egg tray. It has individual slots for the eggs, it\u2019s probably available every Easter, but I had that plastic tray for years.  I bring it to potlucks all the time as my husband is keto and eggs are really filling if you can\u2019t eat anything else. It was like my go to dish to bring. I decorate those eggs nicely with a piping bag.  They get jostled around in any other container. Anyway NTA. No one is going to care of and understand the value of something except you.

You boyfriend totally sold you out and behaved horribly, I might be rethinking the relationship over that honestly. \n\nThat being said, you DID say you thought someone would steal it. You said it, then when you explained it in the post you reiterated that you thought it would be stolen, not misplaced, with some auntie walking off with it. You suck because that IS what you thought would happen, which is a weird way to go in the first place. If you had just said, it\u2019s a big wedding and I don\u2019t want it getting misplaced to the bf in the first place you wouldn\u2019t have been upset that he told the truth to his friends.

I loved them and while they weren\u2019t expensive, they were special to me and I treated them well. An ex-friend once asked if he could take something home with him and I didn\u2019t have any other bags so I entrusted him with one of my totes from Peru. It was from my first trip there and from the first time I met my husband\u2019s grandparents. His grandmother actually bought it for me when she saw how much I liked it. \n\nI asked my friend to please bring it back either the next day or day after that. I had known this friend for the better part of a decade and had never had any issues with him as he had returned my things before - serving trays and things like that. Not only did he not give it back, but I had to go to his parents\u2019 house because he said his mom loved it so much she decided to keep it, but that he was sure I would be okay with it since I\u2019ve gone to Peru many times and have other bags from there. It didn\u2019t end well. I got it back after lots of arguing and a broken friendship. It was stained and the straps were broken\u2026I did my best to clean it up and fix it, but the stains didn\u2019t come out and the straps didn\u2019t look the same. It broke my heart. My husband\u2019s grandma passed away shortly after that incident too and I just felt so bad.", "People that tend to use that excuse \"you shouldn't have had it out if you didn't want anything to happen to it\" are normally the one that actually did the evil deed.  I did it before, out of complete spite. It was a really nice deviled egg tray and I put a tiny, tiny chip in it. Friendship was ruined anyways so it was the final middle finger to them.", "Had to upvote for replacements.com. I have a discontinued china pattern and every plate that gets chipped is a panic attack waiting to happen because they\u2019re so hard to find outside of that website", "And some people just want to throw their partners under the bus. He's a jerk. There was no good reason for him to say anything.", "Or just enjoy humiliating their partner. Dump him.", "I know TONS of couples who act this way, and it\u2019s so odd to me. Especially because I thought we were in the era of calling out the nastiness of the boomer \u201cwife/husband bad\u201d style jokes", "Never underestimate the power of a good bop on the nose!", "Yeah, no filter would have been if the friends had said \"I'm surprised you didn't use your pretty tea tray\" and he'd replied that \"oh, she was afraid someone would steal it\".\n\nBut this sounds more like he went out of his way to bring it up for some reason.", "Oh, let me guess, they are one of those couples that claims that \"we show our love by teasing each other. It only sounds like we are constantly putting each other down and using passive-aggression to avoid genuine conversation \ud83e\udd70\"", "That is certainly part of the problem.", "Really? Only direct comments to the post count toward the judgement poll?", "I thought so too, but the last time I read the rules, I understood them as 'all votes count'. Maybe they changed them, or maybe I was reading half-asleep LOL", "I mean the very top post. This will be NTA because the top post with 11.6k votes is NTA.", "Ahhh interesting. Thanks.", "Its also how we get the numbers by our names. My 65 means I've had 65 top posts.", "Oh wow, I didn\u2019t know that part and wondered how I got my bracketed 2. TIL, thanks!"]}
