I am not really sure why he likes her, and IF he even likes her.\n\nAll the times I have seen Zoe and Brian out together, Zoe would always be doing most of the talking whereas Brian would be very stoic and keep to himself. One moment in particular that stands out to me is when we were all talking in a group with some of his friends and our friends and he seemed so cold and uninterested. He simply sat there with an arm around Zoe listening to her talk. He didn\u2019t add anything to the conversation.\n\nThe only time I\u2019ve ever heard of Brian being affectionate with Zoe is when she got a concussion and he didn\u2019t let Zoe out if his sight for the following weeks. But I\u2019ve never SEEN him be affectionate, he\u2019s extremely cold.\n\nLast night I brought up all my concerns to Zoe. She said that she loves him and wants to spend the rest of her life with him. She said that Brian is busy and when he isn\u2019t working he wants to spend time alone with Zoe, but Zoe kept on dragging him to these events and he obliged to make her happy. She got offended when I brought up how he is so much smarter than her and she won\u2019t speak to me anymore.\n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR; My friend is really affectionate with her fianc\u00e9 but he doesn't act that way with her.

Fair enough if you\u2019re concerned for her wellbeing, but what you\u2019ve listed isn\u2019t anything concerning. He\u2019s quiet/stoic. He doesn\u2019t show affection publicly etc. there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. She\u2019s happy, so leave her to it. Also, to add she\u2019s not very bright??? No reason to put that in there. Makes you sound bitter.", "YTA. You wrapped this as being concerned about your friend, but every word out of your mouth is a quiet put down of her. You claim this guy doesn't care, but when it mattered it sounds like he showed great care when she had a concussion. He rather stay by her side with an arm around her *how is that not PDA, by the way* rather than engage in vapid conversation with you. People who are all over each other is performative and insecure.  You're no true friend and I'm glad she's gotten herself away from you.", "Good lord, I hope this is just a troll. If not, YTA. The way you talk about your friend is extremely insulting and the fact that you aren\u2019t sure if her fianc\u00e9, who is apparently so much smarter than her, actually likes her or not. Keep your shitty ass opinions to yourself - maybe he isn\u2019t overly affectionate and only does certain things his fianc\u00e9 likes just to keep her happy - neither of those things are unusual. Some people aren\u2019t huge fans of PDA and nearly every couple I know participates in some kind of activity that they have no interest in just so they can see their partner be happy. Did you ever think he doesn\u2019t talk much around you because he doesn\u2019t like you? Perhaps he\u2019s seen you put his fianc\u00e9 down before and thinks you aren\u2019t worthy of his/his fianc\u00e9s time because you\u2019re a shitty friend?\n\nAll this being said, it\u2019s quite clear that no matter how smart your friend is, she is clearly light years smarter than you. She didn\u2019t run her mouth off, saying incredibly hurtful things to her friend and then have the audacity to appear surprised when the hurtful thing she said HURT HER FRIEND\u2019S FEELINGS.

None of this stuff even with your bias intact is worrisome. \n\nWhen you strip away your obvious bias it actually makes him look good. He likes listening to her talk and is reserved.

You filled in a lot of blanks based solely on your perception of the limited interactions you have observed. Telling her the relationship can\u2019t work because he\u2019s soooo much smarter than her is just bonkers insulting. If I\u2019m being honest, historically, most of my brother\u2019s partners have been significantly more intelligent than him (with the exception of one), including his wife of six years. With \u2018friends\u2019 like you, who needs enemies? Again, YTA.", "YTA\n\nWhy is this even a question?  The whole story is just 'I told my friend she's dumb and her fiance doesn't like her'.  I mean, there's not a conflict or dilemma here; it's just OP being TA.", "YTA.\n\nYou think you are better than your friend, you offend her, and you even ask if you are TA? My guess is: you want her fianc\u00e9, you are jealous she got a good man. 'If I cannot have him, she can't either'\n\n\nOne would always worry about friend's wellbeing, but you are beyond good wishes. You are mean.", "YTA. You are bitter and jealous, your main concern is that you think he is too smart for her. You called her dumb. and you are surprised that offended her? You suck as a friend. Don\u2019t be surprised when she cuts off all contact.\n\nYou seem to have based your entire opinion of their relationship on the fact that they seem to have opposite personalities and that he is too smart for her. So what? Many couples have different personalities and interests and they still have a loving relationship. This is absolutely none of your business, not your concern, and she didn\u2019t ask for your advice on the relationship so why you felt the need to insert your opinion is beyond me.\n\nEdit: I just read your comments on her major and how you think all she has going for her is her looks and personality. massive YTA. And a horrible friend. Who says that about someone they supposedly like and consider a friend?", "YTA. \n\nWhen Zoe had a concussion, he didn't let him out of his sight. He takes good care of her. \n\nWhile bf remains silent everytime Zoe talks, he listens, he gives his attention. sounds passionate. \n\nHe attends events when Zoe wants him to be there, and he obliges. \n\nwith everything you wrote, its clear bf loves Zoe and cares for her.\n\nBf is not your friend. you said he is rude and cold, can you cite an example? Based on your comments i read, sounds like a jealous one. so yeah a big YTA", "YTA. \n\nYou talk about Zoe with concern, yet are dismissive of her. You\u2019re framing things more around her intellectual level. If you have any reservations about him, you need to let her know that you\u2019ll be there for/care about her. By telling her that she isn\u2019t smart, you\u2019ve alienated her.", "YTA.  \n\nYou don\u2019t see them alone together, so it\u2019s entirely possible he\u2019s more affectionate and communicative in private than in public.  \n\nHe could well be very introverted, and her being more outgoing and extroverted could be part of the appeal for him.  At the same time if she\u2019s used to being treated like the \u2018ditzy child\u2019 by others it\u2019s entirely possible that he treats her like an actual mature adult and that could be part of the appeal for her.  \n\nBeing concerned for your friends isn\u2019t a bad thing, but trying to seed doubt about a relationship they\u2019re in is.  \n\nIt would be a different story if there was evidence he was abusive or otherwise taking advantage of her, but being reserved in public and being intelligent aren\u2019t red flags you should be worried about.", "YTA. Some people are only comfortable opening up in private. You basically said he doesn't love her because he is an introvert who still participates in her interests (albeit quietly). Then you called her stupid.\n\nYour friendship is over, which is probably for the best since you sound so jealous.", "YTA. You say you have concerns about your friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9e but in reality you told her she isn\u2019t intelligent!!!! You are the one who isn\u2019t very bright since you can\u2019t see that your words were insulting and hurtful. You are not a friend but an opinionated observer.", "Gonna be blunt, you sound jealous OP\n\nFrom [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zq1sb/comment/j84l696/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  comment, it sounds like you're trying to make googly eyes at the bf and he doesn't even acknowledge you exist... which you can't handle. \n\nWhy are you making moves on someone else's fiance? That's disgusting behaviour. Please learn to behave and control yourself, otherwise everyone else is going to notice and you're going to lose more than just one friend.", "YA an absolute AH. You don\u2019t know their relationship. Who the hell are you to try and \u201cwarn\u201d her about imaginary dynamics you\u2019ve made up based of how you think he should act?!? Are you going to lead with how you have no idea why he\u2019s with her cause she\u2019s too dumb for him and you don\u2019t even thing he really likes her? How can you even have the audacity to call her your friend?", "YTA Why would you ever think it's a good idea to tell your FRIEND that her fiance is so much smarter than her? It's fine to have concerns and voice them in a respectful way, but you really crossed a line.", "Ugh the jealousy is coming off the screen. You want Brian\n\nYTA", "YTA maybe he's just awkward and not very social; intelligence is relative, and maybe he likes listening to her talk even if it isn't about scholarly things or whatever. And to praise her beauty at the expense of her intelligence just feels mean spirited and condescending. \n\nLike what is this warning even? \"Hey, this guy you're dating is way smarter than you, and doesn't show enough PDA around others, he must be up to something\" \n\n> I am not really sure why he likes her,\n\nWhat a thing to say about someone you call a friend", "YTA. Do you even like your friend? Because you've made it abundantly clear that you don't respect her.", "Sweetie, YTA. It\u2019s not your job as a friend to make judgments of any kind. Not about your friend. Not about her bf. \n\nIf you truly were her friend you wouldn\u2019t be quite so hung up on her. And you are hung up on her. She seems to have something you want or that you perceive you lack. \n\nYour business is not interfering in their relationship. Period. Not to suggest he\u2019s not the one for her. And especially not to tell her she\u2019s not intelligent. \n\nYou\u2019re cruel and seeking to destroy something nice that she has. I suspect you\u2019ve lost the friendship. And rightly so.", "YTA. Your entire problem with him is that he doesn\u2019t talk to you enough, you think he\u2019s too good for Zoe and don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s doesn\u2019t want to be all over you and only wants to interact with his girlfriend when y\u2019all go out. You\u2019re obviously extremely jealous of Zoe and you clearly don\u2019t think much of her. He probably doesn\u2019t like you because you\u2019re condescending and judgmental, and you for some reason think you are better than Zoe. This is pretty much exactly how my sister\u2019s husband acts around one her friends he hates because she\u2019s a terrible friend and he doesn\u2019t understand why my sister puts up with her shitty behavior. You\u2019re a bad friend who is upset your friend found a good, intelligent guy who loves her because you think you deserve him more. It\u2019s not that complicated, he loves her for who she is. People are worth more than their major and what you think their intelligence level is. Maybe if you cared about people you\u2019d get that.", "Your jealous. That\u2019s what your feeling here. Yta.", "YTA and jealous.\n\nMaybe he is quiet because he doesn't think he's smarter/has to interrupt/mansplane.\n\nHe takes care of her when she's injured.\n\nHe's quiet and cold because even if he doesn't want to attend these events, he still does because he loves her.", "Lol, most straightforward YTA ever.", "YTA: have you considered that your \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201dfianc\u00e9 does not need to prove his love for his partner to you? Or maybe he just doesn\u2019t like you, because the way you speak of your \u201cfriend\u201d is appalling. When you are near he may go quiet because he doesn\u2019t care for your company.\n\nFor someone that seems to prize intelligence you may lack the necessary social acumen to understand that continued insults towards one with whom you claim friendship is injurious to the relationship.", "YTA\nSounds like you're jealous of their relationship and how she got a really smart guy and you didn't", "Yta. Maybe Brian is just more open with her when they're alone and Zoe sees a side of him he doesn't show in public. Concern is fine but as long as Zoe is safe and happy you don't really need to butt into their relationship.", "YTA.

He was the sort to sit broodily at the Youth Club disco - I was the sort to be playing table football or pool and slaughtering the boys. At a disco, I would be up head banging to Black Sabbath or Status Quo. He wasn\u2019t unpopular, he was the quiet type who would know the groups discography, and who all the members were and what bands they used to be in.

If you haven't witnessed any abusive behaviour and he's just quiet, you're out of line. You don't have to like him, she does.

I haven't left my apartment since November except to get two covid tests and to get groceries every few weeks and I am so happy. My partner goes to work in person at least twice a week he usually goes out with work friends once a month and tries to see high school and college friends once a month. Every few months he asks me to go out with a college friend and their girlfriend and I say sure because I know even though that sounds like a nightmare to me to him it's his dream. When we are out no touching kissing hugging maybe holding hands while walking and my partner fills the space with words so I spend most of the night sitting there quiet and when we get in the car on the way home my partner is energized and acting like he just had the greatest night of his life and won an Oscar. Meanwhile I am at my most exhausted and ready to not even text or call anyone for two days. Seeing him that happy though makes it worth it and I can only handle it occasionally. If I was doing it all the time I would slowly become cold rude and stoic because it sounds draining to constantly be thrown into social situations like that. I also hate PDA I think it's uncomfortable and makes me feel more uncomfortable than loved and feels performative and my partner knows this. I will maybe kiss him once we get in the car but if my partner sat there gushing about me or touching me or trying to kiss me Infront of others rather than in our own home where I know it isn't for others to see it would bother me and make me have a much worse time.\n\nI think the most concerning thing about your friends relationship is the age gap just because traditionally they are in very different places in life and if they met a year ago she was 20 and probably still in uni, but even that doesn't matter. I would be more concerned about your friend being judged by you for being dull, stupid, talkative, etc. and your raging unchecked jealousy issues. \"My friend found a stable relationship and is happy but it doesn't make sense to me and it doesn't fit the standards I want for my relationship so it is invalid in my eyes yet it continues to happen!\" That's the short hand of what you have written and commented YTA.", "He does show affection, he puts his arms around her in the presence of company.
