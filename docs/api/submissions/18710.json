Initially, i was gonna travel solo with just three days. But we agreed to stay for six days since our concert days fall on different dates. I agreed despite it being more expensive (i literallt have limited budget). So we already booked plane tickets going to the said country. They also told me that accommodations will be taken care by them and will share it with some other friends they met online i just have to pay my share.\n\nThree weeks ago, my friend told me that accommodations will be fixed the next day, and that they'll update me. A week has passed no update.\n\nMessage my friend again two weeks ago via messenger no update.\n\nMessaged again last week via facebook, instagram, and imessage no update. But they keep on posting on these platforms and replies to my other friends on social media.\n\nThe concert is two weeks from now.\n\nEventually, i just gave up and booked my own place without telling them since prices have been going up since the concert is in two weeks. But didnt bother telling them since they've been avoiding me. I tried asking their sibling but still no response. AITA for even getting mad and just booking a place without telling them? I just feel so annoyed but guilty that they might have a mental health issue and cant reply back?\n\nEdit: thank you for the responses everyone!

Kinda sounds like this \"friend\" screwed you over. They were the reason why you extended your trip from 3 days to 6 days when your budget is limited, and they also promised to arrange accommodations and then didn't do that. Then ghosted you. Of course you had to book your own accommodations! And damn, I'm mad at this person on your behalf! In fact, I don't think you're mad enough! There's clearly nothing wrong with them if they're out posting on social media and just not responding to you personally about your travel plans. So you don't need to feel guilty about that. They probably aren't responding because they, too, know they screwed you over.", "NTA this was the mature thing to do, they had every opportunity to update you on the arrangements and clearly did not.  Something was sounding sketchy.  Good on you for not letting someone else's behavior derail your plans.  I wouldn't bother with them any more.. go and have a great time.", "I mean, you only know what you\u2019ve been told. And since you haven\u2019t been told anything, you proceeded with your original plans. NTA", "NTA. You tried contact, if they didn't reply they are at fault. But, just out of curiosity, why didn't you try to call them instead of just sending messages?", "NTA - of course not, theyre not responding to you. You have no other choice", "NTA - Nothing wrong with getting yourself organised. Sounds like they might have ditched you anyway?", "NTA- there is NO reason for them not replying back to you. They\u2019ve been active on social media and responding to other people, the least they could have done is say we don\u2019t know, or whatever.", "NTA. They really didn't leave you much of a choice. You needed to book because prices were rising. They chose not to respond to communication from you on platforms that they have been actively responding to other people. Don't feel bad at all.", "NTA and get a better friend. If they ended up angry with you after you booked your own place, just explain how irresponsible they are for ignoring you. Hell, I don't even think you need to explain anything to them- just...do yourself a favour and get a new friends. Love yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
