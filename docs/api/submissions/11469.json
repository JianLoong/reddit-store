{"id": 11469, "submission_id": "11i2m6k", "title": "AITA for Sending My Sister to Therapy for Her Obsessive Crush on My Abusive Ex?", "selftext": "Background: I (38F) recently ended a tumultuous and abusive relationship with my ex (41M), who is now in jail in another state. My younger sister (20F) became fascinated with him and expressed a desire to visit him in jail despite his violent history towards me. I was concerned about her safety and decided to seek professional help for her.\n\nStory: My sister disclosed to me that she had been following my ex's social media profiles and had developed a crush on him. I was alarmed and tried to explain the dangers of her romanticizing someone who had caused me so much harm. However, she did not understand the gravity of the situation and continued to talk about him in a twisted manner.\n\nAfter researching options, I found a therapist who specialized in obsessive behaviors and made an appointment for my sister. She initially resisted, but I knew that I had to protect her from herself. She went to therapy for a few months, and I noticed a marked improvement in her behavior. She stopped talking about my ex and stopped following his social media accounts. However, our relationship became strained during that time.\n\nNow, a few months later, my sister has started talking to me again, but there is still some tension between us. I feel guilty for sending her to therapy, but I believe that I did what was necessary to protect her from harm.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1677945274, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11i2m6k/aita_for_sending_my_sister_to_therapy_for_her/", "score": 497, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
