{"id": 23202, "submission_id": "15agcv4", "title": "AITA for Refusing to Pay for My Friend's Expensive Wedding?", "selftext": "* A few months ago, my friend, Sarah, who is already extremely wealthy and lives in Dubai, invited me to her extravagant wedding. She comes from a well-off family, and her wedding was going to be nothing short of a lavish affair.Initially, I was excited to attend and be a part of her special day. However, things took a turn when she asked me for a favor. Sarah approached me and requested that I contribute $400 (equivalent to 1000 Emirati Dirhams) towards her wedding expenses. She explained that since her wedding was such a grand affair, she wanted her guests to help cover some of the costs.Now, while I respect Sarah's choice to have a luxurious wedding, I simply couldn't justify spending that much money on a single event, especially since she and her family were already so wealthy. I politely declined her request, explaining that I had other financial obligations and couldn't afford to contribute that amount.Surprisingly, my other friend (let's call him Mark) didn't see any issue with Sarah's request and agreed to pay the amount on my behalf. He said it was okay for me not to contribute directly since he had the means to do so.With that settled, I booked my flight to Dubai and paid for my hotel near the wedding venue. I was excited to be part of the celebration and looked forward to seeing Sarah happy on her big day.However, when I arrived in Dubai and tried to enter the venue with my invitation, a bodyguard stopped me and informed me that I wasn't allowed to attend the wedding. Puzzled and hurt, I immediately called Sarah to understand what was happening.Sarah answered the call, but her tone was less than pleasant. She was angry with me for not paying the 1000 Emirati Dirhams she requested. According to her, it was a matter of disrespect and a sign that I didn't care enough about her to contribute to her dream wedding.I tried explaining my financial constraints and how Mark had agreed to pay on my behalf, but she wasn't having any of it. She accused me of being cheap and ungrateful for not supporting her on her special day.Feeling hurt and misunderstood, I tried talking to my other friends who were attending the wedding, but most of them seemed to side with Sarah. They thought I should have just paid the amount regardless of my financial situation since it was her wedding after all.The situation put a damper on my entire trip, and I ended up spending my time in Dubai feeling left out and unwanted\n\nThoraway account (obvi) but i think shes lying because i grew up in Abu dhabi (because of my fathers job ) and we never had to pay a fee for a wedding\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSomeone sent her this post \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 she's really angry and she messaged me right now, i'm blocking her.
