She comes from a well-off family, and her wedding was going to be nothing short of a lavish affair.  \nInitially, I was excited to attend and be a part of her special day. However, things took a turn when she asked me for a favor. Sarah approached me and requested that I contribute $400 (equivalent to 1000 Emirati Dirhams) towards her wedding expenses. She explained that since her wedding was such a grand affair, she wanted her guests to help cover some of the costs.  \nNow, while I respect Sarah's choice to have a luxurious wedding, I simply couldn't justify spending that much money on a single event, especially since she and her family were already so wealthy. I politely declined her request, explaining that I had other financial obligations and couldn't afford to contribute that amount.  \nSurprisingly, my other friend (let's call him Mark) didn't see any issue with Sarah's request and agreed to pay the amount on my behalf. He said it was okay for me not to contribute directly since he had the means to do so.  \nWith that settled, I booked my flight to Dubai and paid for my hotel near the wedding venue. I was excited to be part of the celebration and looked forward to seeing Sarah happy on her big day.  \nHowever, when I arrived in Dubai and tried to enter the venue with my invitation, a bodyguard stopped me and informed me that I wasn't allowed to attend the wedding. Puzzled and hurt, I immediately called Sarah to understand what was happening.  \nSarah answered the call, but her tone was less than pleasant. She was angry with me for not paying the 1000 Emirati Dirhams she requested. According to her, it was a matter of disrespect and a sign that I didn't care enough about her to contribute to her dream wedding.  \nI tried explaining my financial constraints and how Mark had agreed to pay on my behalf, but she wasn't having any of it. She accused me of being cheap and ungrateful for not supporting her on her special day.  \nFeeling hurt and misunderstood, I tried talking to my other friends who were attending the wedding, but most of them seemed to side with Sarah. They thought I should have just paid the amount regardless of my financial situation since it was her wedding after all.  \nThe situation put a damper on my entire trip, and I ended up spending my time in Dubai feeling left out and unwanted\n\nThoraway account (obvi) but i think shes lying because i grew up in Abu dhabi (because of my fathers job ) and we never had to pay a fee for a wedding", "created_utc": 1690402289, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15agcv4/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_friends_expensive/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Asking friends to pay for your lavish wedding is terrible. Banning them for refusing after they traveled there is unconscionable.", "NTA You politely told her that you couldn\u2019t afford it. Someone else payed for it on your behalf. Why is she mad? It\u2019s her wedding not yours. You\u2019re not obligated to pay anything. Screw her and the friends they sided w/her.

I hope she got no gifts. \n\nCan\u2019t imagine what the baby registry will look like.", "NTA and I don\u2019t know why anyone would say otherwise, and why your friends actually AGREED to paying such an exuberant amount to go to a wedding.

I've never heard of a wedding funded by guests. You were expected to pay a $400 fee, on top of paying for travel and accommodation? Were you also obligated to purchase Sarah a gift? That is a lot of money.\n\nIt's Sarah's wedding, so she has every right to require an entrance fee. Your fee was paid, regardless of whose bank account it came out of.

That's pretty fucked up by itself, but the fact she took your friend's money, the money that was meant to cover for you, and still not allowed you to attend?

Hassan (Mark) had to pay 5000 Emirates NOT including the 1000 he had to pay for OP so in USD I think he payed 1000 dollars. I talk to everyone in the group chat and everyone explained they had different amounts. Salem is also a polyamory liar and a gaslight I hope her husband realizes this before it is too late. And the wedding was horrible too. They are planning to have a child too soon and from what I heard for the gender reveal everyone has to pay .They also forced the Owner to repaint the Mosque to Blue and Gold .

If she can't afford the wedding she wants she either needs to postpone it and save up, or have a less expensive wedding.

She's not your friend.

It\u2019s not a damn concert.\n\nGirl deserves to be disrespected", "If this is true, your friends are so delusional!", "Mark is amazing! Hope he didn't give in to the peer pressure.

If this was strictly a US or EU thing then i would clearly say NTA, however are things done differently in Dubai?  Is it more of a party for everyone?

Stop being friends with her and the other guests. \n\nKeep Mark around. Was he denied entry? Based on her logic, technically he contributed double the asking price.

Whilst I\u2019m sure all of us in the comment section can agree that a wedding is a very important event in multiple peoples lives, they were not even considering your side or your financial situation, which is extremely selfish of them.
