He'll be 18 in December.\n\nThe other nephew and nieces in question are Cole (28m) and Melody and Briony (30f).\n\nMy sister is the biological mother of Cole, Melody and Briony. Their father died when the kids were 8 and 10. My sister married James' dad 15 years ago and she never formally adopted him but did raise him as her son. There was a lot of tension and conflict in the home and Cole, Melody and Briony all moved out immediately upon graduating/turning 18. The relationship with my sister then ended. It also ended with James and his father. I stayed in contact with the three of them though and have always known where they are and that they are not interested in reconciliation.\n\nEver since my sister took on James as her own, they have allowed him to believe she is his biological mother and that the other kids are his biological siblings and it was only a few years ago I realized he believed they shared the same father as well. My sister and her husband have always encouraged James to believe that his siblings love and want to know him and that they will have a relationship one day. He has been craving that more in the last 2.5 years or so.\n\nHe has mentioned it a number of times. Some family members and I tried to convince his parents to at least tell him the biological truth so he's not faced with it from people who will not care about cushioning his feelings or making sure he's okay. They refused. My sister said there is no biological truth. They are the parents and all four are their kids and it ends there.\n\nJames has been talking to me a lot about finding his siblings and being excited to have them back in his life. He mentioned how maybe he could reconcile their parents and them too. And how he hoped to prove they were never replaced by him and that he knows it must have been hard to have a baby come into the family so much later. He believed that was what the estrangement was about. What his parents told him.\n\nI decided he needed to know after my sister and her husband refused yet again to talk to him. So I was honest. My sister wasn't his bio mom and his dad was not their bio dad. They were not blood siblings. I told him I loved him and it didn't make him less of my nephew but I didn't want him blindsided by not getting the response he was expecting. He asked me if they would actually want a relationship with him. I told him no. He confronted his parents about the lies and the way they were setting him up.\n\nMy sister called and told me I was an asshole and stepped out of my place by telling him what I did without her and her husband's consent. I can see my nephew (James) is struggling and trying to work out his head after the truth and it makes my sisters words hit harder.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667297892, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj4wpo/aita_for_telling_my_nephew_about_family_dynamics/", "score": 9748, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s important that James understands the real dynamics and can take those to therapy or into life.\n\nAnd honestly, it\u2019s important for other reasons, like medically. \n\nI\u2019m glad he has you. NTA", "NTA\n\nThe biggest reason for my vote is because his dad and stepmom let him think he was the reason the other kids left. That\u2019s horrible to put on a kid. Im not saying the rest of the lies are okay, but the way this poor kid must have felt. Thinking he was the reason his family couldn\u2019t be a family. It was going to hurt even worse if he spoke to his siblings and got hit with that from a place of pain from them. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t your info to share, but he needed to know. Someone had to do right by this kid because his parents were failing him big time. They will obviously blame you, but their actions are probably going to cause them to lose contact with all 4 kids.", "NTA he is 17, wanted answers, and it would have been awful he was turned down by the 3 step siblings and found the truth harshly. Also your sister failed her children so badly, it was nice of you to step in and help her not fail another child.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister was caught up in a \"happy family\" fantasy. Regardless, it was cruel to lie to him about his parentage, and to set him up to be blindsided when he finally sought out his other family members. You did him a kindness by telling him the truth *before* he went on that journey.", "NTA\n\nYour sister and BIL basically put all the blame for damaged family dynamics on James. This poor kid has been going through life thinking his birth wrecked a loving family. That poor kid.", "NTA - he should know. It sucks you had to tell him but he deserved to know.", "NTA, I would never blame anyone for speaking the truth. I personally had a close friend growing up whose parents told him on his 18th birthday the man who raised him was not his father. It messed him up for a couple years. When he finally found his bio dad the man was in the end stages of a terminal illness and had already lost his memory. There was no reconciliation to be had.\n     Parents want to shield their kids from pain but in these types of scenarios it's not really pain avoided it's just pain delayed. If my friend had been told the truth even a few years earlier he would have had the opportunity to talk with his bio dad and at least had a short time with him. \n    Don't feel guilty for speaking the truth ever. Do follow up with your Nephew though. He'll need you to have his back through this however he decides to proceed.", "NTA, their lies were setting him for cruel heart break. What did they think was going to happen? He was obviously going to search and eventually find the other kids and they would told him the truth. You thought of his feelings and spared him more pain. \n\nAlso my god he thinks everything was his fault, and his parents let him believe that. That is unbelievably cruel. He\u2019s carried that around for so long and they never said a word, and let him believe that he was the cause of the other kids leaving. I can\u2019t fathom that level of guilt and the pain it must have caused him growing up. His parents are monstrous to see that and let him believe it.", "NTA. He's still struggling because the two people who aren't supposed to lie to him did. They don't want to accept they're are crappy parents. Trust me, it would have been worst to go to the sibblings, getting it himself and understanding everyone but him knew the truth.", "NTA\n\nEveryone has the right to know their biological history.\n\nIts weird when non biological parents attempt to live a fantasy of being the biological parent, but its sick, twisted and cruel when they force the child to also live within that delusion against the child's will and/or without their consent.\n\nThe truth had to be told by someone, and it takes courage to be that someone, especially knowing you will get the backlash because your family will find it easier to be mad at you (a reasonable person) than your sister (an unreasonable person who might have unpredictable and disproportionate reactions to criticisms).", "INFO \n\nHow bad was the situation with the other 3 siblings that they fled and never looked back at 18\n\nInside taht house must have been hostile \u2026", "INFO wouldn't he notice that your sister isn't on his birth certificate? When he applies for a passport or needs his birth certificate for a job or driver's license, he might just notice that there is another woman's name there. (Did she pass away?) \n\nMy guess is that some piece of paper would have told him eventually, which is a terrible way to find out.", "NTA- he\u2019s almost an adult, he deserved to know", "NTA. His parents should have told him. They weren't doing their job. He needed to know.", "As you said better being told gently by someone who loves him than having it thrown in his face by someone who will reject him. \n\nThinking that being late born is the reason why his 'siblings' don't want him is bad enough because in his mind it is all his fault. \n\nNTA. He needed to know before he opened himself to a world of hurt. Further hurt.", "NTA your sister is cruel. She let James think it was his fault the family fell apart, and if James never knew the truth she presumably completely erased the other kids' dead father and banned them from speaking about him. That is horrific. I hope James will realise that what your sister did was not his fault, and I hope the other kids will too", "I think you were in the right OP. I spent a lot of time thinking I was crazy because my Dad convinced me I was the problem for speaking up. I visited my Aunt, who is considered the black sheep of the family only because she tell it like it is. \n\nI learned a lot of things that broke my heart and angered me but it gave me the power to know I wasn't crazy and that as much as I loved my parents I needed to trust myself about their truths.\n\nIt may be hard right now, but continue to let him reach out and be there for him. As long as he knows you love him and will be honest with him, that is more important.\n\nAlso, can you explain what the heck happened between your sister, the other bio kids and James' Dad? Why did they leave?", "NTA, people have a right to know their biological history, for medical reasons as much as anything! But also because he clearly could tell something was weird about the situation and they'd resolved it by doubling down on the gaslighting and blaming his existence for the parental breakup/distance between him and his siblings!", "NTA. I went back and forth. What sealed it for me is that your sister and her husband made him think it was his fault his siblings left. The fact they refused to tell the truth is horrible. They are definitely TA. \n\nI would be interested in why the older kids all moved out immediately after turning 18. And do they really blame the then 5-7 year old for that? \n\nIt is better he hear the truth from you than someone who isnt concerned about his feelings. And you have the right mentality that he is still your nephew no matter what.", "NTA he has a right to know. Anything else is meaningless.", "NTA - just based on the fact that this happy family syndrom is also in my family in various stages and people just don't talk about stuff. It's nice to get some infos from at least someone!", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA. While not normally your place, his parents have decided and shown they have no intention to tell him the truth.  Since James is having a hard time processing, please be there for him; don\u2019t open his Pandora\u2019s box and then leave the fallout.  He\u2019s close enough to 18, so if your sister forbids it, at least you can be there for him in a couple months.", "Your poor nephew. Continue to be there for him because someone has to be. NTA.", "NTA- your nephew is almost an adult, and as the person most affected by his parents lies deserves to know the truth. She's pissed because her paper thin lies were shredded.", "He could've just as easily ordered a DNA kit and been slapped in the face with the truth with no buffer. The truth comes out, it always does and it's better it came from you.", "NTA. It was a truth lmown to everyone but then person it most concerned, James. You did the right thing. It may be difficult for your sister to accept that they've bene caught in the lie, but it uad to come out sooner or later.", "Gonna go with NTA in this case. When he (inevitably) would've found out for himself, he would be crushed and likely have some resentment towards you too. I think that this is an unreasonable lie for you to uphold on their behalf as it is unnecessarily cruel.\n\nFor the parents (knowing that they are not getting reconciliation from the others) to continue keep James' hopes high is brutal. It's hard to believe they've thought about anyone but themselves in this situation", "Info: what was the tension about when the older kids where living there? What led them to going no contact with your sister?", "NTA. You did a kindness to that boy.", "Nta, better to get it kindly from you, than to be ripped up one side and down the other by one of the step siblings", "NTA\n\nLies should never be supported. I can\u2019t imagine why she thought this would work or why it was a good idea", "NTA. The sister is. She made the whole family lie for the sake of a happy family image. He's 17. You're the only person looking out for him. He was about to be potentially traumatized by the step siblings telling him in a harsher way.", "NTA. If James manages to get in touch with his step siblings what did your sister and her husband THINK would happen? That he would give up if he didn't get a response? That the step sibs would keep quiet? Would his dad and your sister blame James? Blame the siblings? They certainly wouldn't tell him the truth or blame themselves.", "NTA\n\nYou kept your nephew out of the dark and divulged the truth for reasonable and rational purposes. He deserved to know what was going on so he can make informed decisions in the future accordingly.", "NTA - people need to know who their biological parents are so they can have an accurate family medical history. There are also myriad social and psychological reasons to not keep this kind of information from someone. It is cruel to let a child live under a guise like this because it is more comfortable for the parents.  Children need to be told these things from a pre-verbal age with appropriate updates to the narrative as they grow. \n\nSource: i am donor conceived and my parents told me late in life. It was a massive shock but I needed to know.", "NTA \n\nMy own hubby didn\u2019t speak to his mom for 5 years for keeping him in the dark about his bio family. He even grew up in the same town as they were but never knew why the lady at the store always treated him so nice. She was his grandmother but didn\u2019t know. It really hurt him not being able to have a relationship with them growing up.", "NTA he has a right to know his family history", "You don\u2019t need her consent to telling him anything you want!\n Good grief.  The poor boy.  NTA", "NTA They were telling a lie that was harming him and served no purpose. Parental rights don't include making sure your child believes a hurtful lie for no reason.", "NTA", "NTA! What happened in that house that all three of her children left at 18 and cut her off? \n\nJames needed to know the truth. It\u2019s egregious that his father allowed this lie. Four kids, three estranged and one in emotional crisis. Tragic", "NTA. You were right to think he needed to hear the truth. He absolutely did, for many reasons. One being in case of medical stuff he might inherit from his bio mom/mom's family. Another is if his bio mom's family wanted any kind of relationship with him, the dad may have well cut them out and denied them. Another is Incase of an inheritance/will from bio mom, something he should really look into. And another is for the very reason you posted OP, he is looking for what he believes is his bio siblings, what's going to happen when he finds and contacts them? If they left home and went NC as soon as they could, that implies that your sister and her new husband tried to force the relationship dynamics and it did not go well, for anybody, at all. What they (sister/BIL) did, and are still doing is disgusting. It's not ok. All of this is on the sister and BIL. None of it is on the kids, any of them. It would be nice to try to explain the situation, to the older nephew and nieces, about the lies the youngest was raised believing, and explain about the truth being told to him. It's entirely up them if they have a relationship with him, but they really shouldn't take what the supposed adults did out on him.  I feel terrible for your nephew, keep being supportive OP!!", "NTA and thank you for looking out for your nephew", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s old enough, and it\u2019s so sad for him that his parents made him believe it was all his fault!!", "NTA. what the flip. how does he think they're his biological siblings? He doesn't even know how long his parents have been together? I grew up asking my mum to tell me how she fell in love with my dad....this is a couple who don't communicate on any level with their kids, it's no wonder the older 3 left. James is about to become an adult and have a right to his own paperwork, this is impossible for them to cover up. Not to mention he has a right to know about his own birth mum. He needed to be told and you gave them ample opportunity to do it.", "NTA. Yes, you overstepped but in this situation, where James has been lied to his entire life, I judge it OK.\n\nI wonder what where James\u2019 mother is. And if he has other bio family who might want to know him. \n\nYour sister\u2019s kids may be fed up with her and the stepfather (James\u2019 dad) but I am not sure why the totally reject James. He is still just a child and innocent in whatever crap happened when they had to live in that house.  (I am thinking it might be pretty bad, but suppose it could have been simply and unkindly denying their father\u2019s existence). I am sympathetic to all the kids here, as apparently OP is.  And very unsympathetic to OP\u2019s sister and James\u2019 father. I think they did wrong by all the kids.", "I have so many questions. Did they never expect him to find out he's not her's? Like ancestry kits taken just for fun might never happen and he might never see a copy of his own birth certificate and no maternal family exists to ever go looking for him? The older kids were teens, did they call the stepfather dad? Did the stepfather formally adopt them or do they have a different last name which would be a huge clue that they don't have the same dad? Like how do you actually keep that secret from the youngest without the teens giving it away? I'm assuming the birth mother died, but it didn't say that despite specifying that the older kids' birth father passed away. Did they cut his maternal family out of his life completely? What a horrible dishonor to the memory of the woman who gave him life. How did they think he would react when the truth inevitably came to light? \n\nNta, the kid deserves to know. My daughter has never not known her dad isn't her biological dad. Water is wet, cats are cuddly, chocolate is good, and Dad isn't blood related. These are simple truths that exist. Nothing to hide, no major conversation was ever had, this is just the way it has always been.", "Confused by what you said\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* My sister wasn't his bio mom and his dad was not their bio dad\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought new husband was james bio dad and you sister didnt adopt him", "NTA", "Well darn, NTA. I initially said yes but no, nta. Your sister is a major ah though. For erasing their father and lying to james.", "NTA, he's old enough to know the truth. Better you who care and love him than some drunk relative smack the hard truth on him,casually.\n\nAlso your sister have the good intention, just bad execution. Don't blame them for hiding it because they afraid that the relationship may estranged or something. Just a mistake that is done due to love.", "NTA\nAt 17, he is old enough to know the truth.", "Your sister and her husband were lying to James by allowing him to believe they were his biological partents. If he had not found out from you, at 17 going on 18, he still would've found out the truth. Your sister and her husband were protecting THEIR feelings/status/social standing with no regard to Jame's long-term needs and I think that is pretty inhumane. NTA", "Your sister and his dad were setting him up for a much bigger heartbreak and bring selfish doing this this way, they let him blame himself for years when it was thier actions and choices that caused everything", "Nta, james would eventually need his birth certificate. When he sees that your sisters name wasn't on it, how where they going to explain that one?", "NTA\n\nHe was *going* to find out. It was impossible that he didn\u2019t. His parents *should* have been the ones to tell him but they absolutely refused. The fact that you did so is a kindness. He found out from someone who loved him and would be gentle and considerate of his feelings. If it had been allowed to continue he would have been told by someone who\u2019s feelings ranged from apathy and resentment to potentially outright hatred. He was being set up to fail and he hurt *badly* and his parents are massive AH for doing so.", "NTA we know why the kids cut contact. It seems mom and step dad erased their bio dad from their lives by pretending James was their father. And these \u201cparents\u201d still have not learned from that. They are about to lose this kid too. Usually I\u2019d say stay out of it but they did enough damage on their own and he came to you. Don\u2019t be another person to withhold the truth. He at least knows the one person in his life that can be trusted is you.", "Normally, I'd say Y T A or E S H but in this case, I'd go with NTA.\n\nIt's one thing to disclose certain information, but I think the parent's decision to completely lie is significantly more detrimental to James than knowing the truth. Your sister is delusional in thinking \"there is no biological truth\". The courts and legal systems have different opinions. Does your BIL think he's a parent to C, B, and M? I think they would differ.", "NTA", "NTA.\nThis situation is just so sad. James should have known about this long before now. His parents are so wrong here.\nDid they really think he would never find out?\n\nHe probably should contact his step-siblings at some point, even if just to satisfy his curiosity. I don't think he should expect much from them, but it would at least give him the opportunity to tie up some loose ends and move forward. \n\nI hope you maintain a good relationship with him. He needs you.", "So he grew up believing his father wasn\u2019t his bio dad? That he had the same father as the other siblings, who died? \n\nEither he was raised thinking his father was dead, or the other siblings had to lie and say their stepfather was their bio dad. Either way, so much deceit for what? It\u2019s insane. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
