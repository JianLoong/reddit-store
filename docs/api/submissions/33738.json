My dad was still living in her house when I was a baby, so my ornament went on her tree for the first couple years. When my dad moved out, she refused to give his or mine to him. I've tried asking her for it, but her answer basically boiled down to \"no, you lived here as a baby, so I get to have your ornament.\" I knew asking again wouldn't change her answer because my dad has had multiple conversations with her about both his and mine, and obviously the answer never changed. And I know it's just some small ornament, but it's a little awkward and upsetting to be standing there when the rest of my siblings get to put theirs up on the Christmas tree and I don't. Well, we were at my grandparents house earlier, and I caught sight of my ornament when the room was empty, so I took it off the tree and put it in my purse. I'm home now, so it's too late to put it back anyways. My mom said that my grandma's gonna be mad when she finds out, though she doesn't care that I took it, and my boyfriend said he didn't see the point in making a fuss over it, but he also understands where I'm coming from. I'm kinda just turning here for whether or not it was shitty of me to take it.", "created_utc": 1703570756, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r1fw5/aita_for_taking_my_baby_ornament/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
