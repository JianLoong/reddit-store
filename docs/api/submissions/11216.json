Something I've noticed at almost every gym I've been to is if the same equipment (e.g., multiple squat racks) are occupied, people will always ask me first when my sets are done. Often they will not approach others using the equipment which are occupied by men. I've pointed out in the past to people asking to jump in that two others have been using the equipment for much longer than me and I'm on my first set. I've even specifically asked people why they only asked me and not the other men using the equipment, and no one has offered an explanation yet. It does bother me and generally I've had some unpleasant interactions with people who view their workout as majorly important and mine as... not. I don't get the same attitudes from other women in the gym for example.\n\nAnyway, today I was using the cable machine and someone asked how many sets I had left. I said I've just begun wanted to do two exercises of 3. Instead of checking the four other cable machines in eye shot, he hung around me and kept looking over at me. I just ignored him and carried on, but he was definitely bothering me a lot. I knew there were other cable machines available - I could see them - but generally I don't want to engage too much with people in the gym and I'm there to focus on myself. I will respond to people about equipment but that's about it.\n\nHe comes back over after my second set and asks again. I said that I already told him and carried on. I was using both cables, and after my third set he comes over *again* and asks if I'm using the other cable.\n\nI was fed up of this person hovering around me anxiously so I just dropped the cable and said, \"Fine, have it,\" and stormed off. He yelled at me saying he was 'just asking' but I ignored him and went to one of the free cable machines to finish.\n\nI told my friends about this interaction, and some of them said I'm TA for getting angry with him or not pointing out something else was free. I feel like it's rude to hang around waiting for a machine and ask every set, rather than go do something else, or not bother to check if other equipment is available. From my experience 'how many sets do you have' has just resulted in people trying to argue or pressure me off equipment, so it might be true I'm formed a particular opinion of certain people at the gym and maybe that makes me TA...

He had no business hovering over you like that, especially if there were free machines available for him to use. You\u2019re not responsible for pointing it out to him. He\u2019s got working eyes. If he\u2019s not capable of using them, that\u2019s not your problem.", ">not pointing out something else was free\n\nWhy did your friends think he couldn't see it without your help? He's just a bully or something.\n\nNTA", "INFO\n\nWhy did you not report the harassment to the gym?\n\nAlso..never give up the machine to people like this.", "NTA-it's rude hanging around a machine like that. Let people work out in peace.", "NTA, but I would have asked him, why dont you use another machine.", "NTA\n\nScrew toxic gym culture, and screw the sexism embedded in it.", "NTA - that guy has terrible gym etiquette", "Definitely NTA but next time do NOT give in!! Sounds like you\u2019ve been doing an excellent job at handling these AH tho.", "NTA. He knew what he was doing. Next time bring some wireless earbuds (whether you use them or not) and just have them in when you do your workouts. If it doesn\u2019t stop these kind of people, it\u2019ll at least weed out some of them.", "NTA\n\nMaybe next time just point out that he is free to use the machines that aren't occupied and you would appreciate it if he gave you some space and quit lurking around.", "NTA, he should have used other machines or done other exercises until you appeared to be finished and moving on. Only then would it be appropriate to check with you if you were done with the machine. Gym etiquette shouldn't be that hard for people to understand.", "Nta and this is just yet another reason I'd rather work out at home, beyond the fact I'm too anxious to workout in front of strangers lol but the guy bothered you multiple times and you got frustrated which is completely understandable. If the guy was too oblivious/blind to see the free equipment then why do you as a stranger have to coddle him?", "NTA.\n\nIf space is limited, it's reasonable to ask to work in, but I wouldn't do it unless someone is vacating a machine between sets (like running a circuit).  As a dude, I would never ask to work in with a woman.  I definitely don't ask people \"how much more\", that's basically code for \"hurry up\" or \"let's shag\".\n\nThe real question is whether you're being hit on or if they're just rude AHs.", "NTA - hovering around people while there are machines free it\u2019s quite impolite. \nHowever, for your own inner piece, it\u2019s better to reply with a smile and go ahead with your exercise, or point to machines that are free, if any, otherwise the only result is that you got angry.", "nta, sounds like you got frustrated. BUT I'm a man and have been asked multiple times if I was almost done.

I actually thought it was normal to ask to work in rather than wait, I generally say no anyway and accept I might be the asshole for saying that. But interesting to hear it might not be the norm. I'd say my current gym has at least three of each of the high demand stuff (squat racks .etc) but I've definitely been asked a fair few times if someone can work in between sets... usually just shake my head and carry on (for clarity I don't do circuits either, sets and move on for me).", "Its a bit weird to me that they are waiting for a specific machine when machines of the same capability are right over there. So I guess dude was perving on her?", "That bit about hanging around you while other machines were available gives me some pervy vibes. Tough to say what to do in the situation. Do you think your snapping at him was more from being perved on or from him asking repeatedly?", "Hard to say but I think he was just impatient. In his defence he did a few chest dips on the machine next to me but then kind of hung around in front of me checking his notepad and looking over before he asked the second time. I got more 'I need to do my tricep pulldowns right here right now' vibes more than anything else. I snapped because I was just fed up of someone interrupting me, I felt like I was being pressured to move on."]}
