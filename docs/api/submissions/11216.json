But asking multiple times, when they\u2019ve already answered? NOPE. That\u2019s when you take your sweet time. \n\nAs a general rule if I feel I\u2019m being rushed, (as opposed to a man genuinely just trying to plan his routine), or if I notice they\u2019ve specifically bypassed equipment used by men to ask me, I tell them I\u2019m just getting started or give them a higher number of sets even if it\u2019s not true.", "NTA but next time talk to the gym staff.

There's no way for anyone to know where someone is in their sets without asking and the length of time they will take - so why only ask women? Also, everyone trains differently - don't think it's clear cut how long people take rest breaks/warm up based purely on weight and gender.", "> I actually thought it was normal to ask to work in rather than wait,\n\nIt depends, usually people that are shy or insecure will not ask to work in. But it is pretty normal especially if they want to use that specific equipment, I always offer to let someone work in if I've just gotten to the equipment. I'm not there to hog stuff... UNLESS it's a squat rack or bench and the person is either way taller or way shorter than me, then it ain't gonna work out.", ">I actually thought it was normal to ask to work in rather than wait\n\nwaiting is common, especially if working in would mean resetting equipment and weights beyond moving the pin up or down a few plates.  Some exercise routines have specific order they should be done in so you can't say skip squats and go to benchpresses\n\nWaiting also helps ensure you don't go off to do something else and come back and find the first person left and another is now using it.\n\nHowever, the etiquette of waiting has a big provision **NO HOVERING** and he clearly hovered and interrupted you multiple times with essentially the same question plus the etiquette of don't stare at anyone, especially the women.\n\nYou are NTA for your response to his rudeness", "Most people feel more comfortable approaching women to ask something rather than men.\n\nIt's annoying and rooted in patriarchal bullshit, but it's pretty ubiquitous at this point.", "It's not about my workout being more important then anyone elses, if that was the case i would shoo away any women or man thats in a squat rack.  \n\n\nAnd anyones own workout is more important to them then another persons, you said you dont like people working in with you @ comments on the same excercise.  \nWich is fine if you dont want to, but im not going to call it sexist, just what you prefer.  \n\n\nAnd i did not say \"to be left alone\" i also said, i would ask all people near me using the squat racks how long they had left, you added that little thing as if i said that, wich i didn't.\n\nI'm not the guys you had issues with at the gym coming up to you and only asking you at the racks how long you had left, im just stating what goes on at my gym.  \n\n\nTheirs a higher chance for a women to take less time, not that they deserve less time and thats why those men at your gym might have asked you, and maybe they did ask just you because your a women and asumed something, thats on them and very anoying, and as i said they should have asked the others because those guys just asumed you would use it a shorter amount of time.  \nAnd true, you definetly have people that could do lower weight but high sets and take more time then a powerlifter would.  \nAnd you also have amazing lifters like Chloe Brennan who you could never tell what they lift.", "This is the dream.

But with the further info you've added here I wonder if it comes down to a mental health issue? Mostly because you were saying it was a vibe of \"I need to do my tricep pulldowns right here right now\" when there were other machines readily available. It's possible he has something similar to autism or ocd (I'm not trying to diagnose him, these are just examples) where changes in routine are hard and if that was the machine he always uses he may be stuck on the idea that he ***has*** to always use that specific machine and that's why he seemed so insistent on it and stayed hovering.\n\nAs I said though, it doesn't excuse anything and even if mental health of some sort did play into this interaction it's still on him to behave appropriately and manage his symptoms.

The only time guys talk to me it's to ask questions about my lifting program, or to compliment my form (but not in a creepy way).", "NTA but boy would I have slugged his creepy ass", "NTA", "INFO: You mention he asked if he could use the other cable. You keep saying singular cable.  Were you using both cables", "Sometimes people for whatever reason prefer a specific set of equipment over others. Maybe this is why. \n\nBut I suspect that it's easier/takes less courage to approach a woman and ask her to move that another man who might just tell them to F*#k off.\n\nIt's a powerplay. They see you as being lesser to them/someone they can coerce easily.\n\nYou are NTA. Smash the patriarchy!", "NTA\n\nI'm petty. After the second time he asked, and every time thereafter, I would've looked at him and said, \"Well damn. Now I've lost count so I'll have to start ALL OVER AGAIN.\"", "Nta", "I would\u2019ve brought it up with the Jim staff. Let\u2019s have a discussion about this. You are harassing me while I\u2019m trying to do my work out. You asked me how many sets I have left, which is totally reasonable, and I told you and then you kept coming back between each that and asking me again to try to pressure me off the machine. Well done, you\u2019ve done it.\n\nWhat\u2019s the gyms ruling on this? If this is acceptable behavior, you need to know right now that you will never have another moments peace in this gym from me.", "In my experience that just makes people actually tap your shoulder and make \"take them out\" gestures.", "made me think of that guy on here who made his legs jello because of another rude gym goer on here lol I am petty & will do workouts out of spite", "I don\u2019t have a full home gym, but I do exercise at home and I will never go to an actual gym to exercise. Having what I need at home is just way too convenient", "I agree, it\u2019s all context.  I might be too negative, but I find it far too often people are either at the gym to socialize or put on a show. I want to get in and get out.", "I would also consider that he may be neurodivergent. Maybe that\u2019s the machine he always uses and he always does his stuff in a certain order. What you\u2019ve described reminds me a little bit of one of my kids. It\u2019s almost a compulsion for him to keep checking on when something he\u2019s waiting on will be ready. And he can\u2019t do stuff out of order without being thrown off completely. He\u2019s an adult now and we\u2019ve worked on this a lot but he\u2019s still noticeably bothered by situations like what you described. He isn\u2019t trying to be rude and he doesn\u2019t want to be rude but he sometimes ends up being rude. Idk if that\u2019s the case with the guy at your gym but wanted to throw it out there as a possibility. NTA by the way", " NTA that guy was rude. He asked and you answered. He should have backed off until you were done", "I would have concluded that the guy just wanted to creep on me, and was trying to make himself seem less shitty by pretending to ask about the machine. But it\u2019s equally possible that he just wanted to assert dominance, which sadly does happen.", "NTA. So much sexism at gyms. I do a martial art and our women\u2019s class gets interrupted daily by people walking through, some even try to chat up our coach (who is a man) during our class. I\u2019ve never seen it happen to the men\u2019s class even once. Women\u2019s fitness is seen as serving an ornamental purpose rather than a practical one.", "NTA. You should complain to the gym staff.", "well, you could be simply trading one AITA for [a different one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fm1zm/aita_for_writing_a_rude_letter_to_my_neighbors/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)", "If you know another language, that moment when the ultra rude ones tap you on the shoulder is the best time to start talking very quickly about the weather and watch them panic", "NTA. The guy hovering is TA and he bloody knows it.", ">I told my friends about this interaction, and some of them said I'm TA for getting angry with him or not pointing out something else was free.\n\nOpie I am more concerned and giving your friends the ah because seriously common sense is not really common anymore because you told them what was going on and that man was just being a total creep", "Girl NTA he just wanted to stare at you in your (probably very nice) gym clothes and be creepy.", "Stick some earphones in (or if it's comfortable a big fuck off set of headphones). They don't even need to be connected to anything. Tap them and shake head if someone tries to talk to you.", "NTA and may be worth talking to the gym.", "NTA\n\nas a fellow female gym-goer I've become an AH with people like that, after the second time they ask and I see that there are machines open I just point at them and tell them to go over there as I'm gonna be here for a while. \n\nAlternatively, I tell them straight on that them hovering around me makes me uncomfortable and I will signal them/tell them when I'm done.", "YTA x 2\n\nFirst for hogging the machines\n\nSecond for your sexist tirade when someone asks you about it.\n\nIt is rude and selfish to hog a machine when it would be easy to share with people. This is obvious and well-known. People always ask others who as hugging machines how long they plan to hit them for, male or female.", "NTA - I suggested this to a woman in the past to tell the man asking that you're having a heavy period and that he should give you an opportunity to wipe down the machine after you're finished using it.\n\nThis should (1) shut him up (2) scare him and freak him out (3) he'll think twice before asking another woman for a machine. (4) rely on his ignorance about women's bodies because one should have nothing to do with the other \n\nHe clearly thinks women have less entitlement to use the equipment than any random man", "NTA. It\u2019s not OK to ask how many sets someone has left. Ask to work in.\n\nUnless of course there are empty machines in which case GO USE THEM!", "Every time they ask how many more the answer goes up.", "Some people just prefer certain machines, they don't have to be unsuitably different for the exercise for someone to prefer a different one.  At the gym I used to go to equipment near the glass wall/big window always got taken first, one of the older treadmills was noisy and was usually the last to be taken etc.", "You're right, but it's just a small minority of people. Do you honestly believe this person is being targeted? And if you're a girl, I bet you don't have the issue described in the thread. That's because it doesn't exist. OP isn't special and apparently over reacted to a weird dude, if that dude existed"]}
