{"id": 22823, "submission_id": "155urzq", "title": "AITA for giving my granddaughter a nickname?", "selftext": "When I first became a grandmother, I started the tradition of picking nicknames for my grandchildren. Most of my grandkids are now in their teens. I still call the teens the same nicknames I gave them as newborns.\n\nThere\u2019s a WhatsApp group with me and my husband, our children and their spouses where we exchange photos and other updates. When my 9th grandchild was born, I was very excited when my son announced her name in the evening. I spent that night thinking what nickname she should have. It\u2019s a very special moment for me. The following day, I greeted everyone in the WhatsApp group and announced the nickname I chose for my granddaughter and said I hoped they all loved it as much as I did. \n\nI nicknamed each of my granddaughters after a colorful fish species from my native language, not the English version.\n\nMy son\u2019s wife immediately replied in the group text that they have carefully chosen my granddaughter\u2019s legal name and everyone would be calling her that and the nickname I chose sounded too much like a name change instead of an endearing nickname. Admittedly, the nickname I picked has been consistently on the \u201ctop girl names\u201d list in my language in the last 3 years so I guess it\u2019s valid for her to assume it sounded like a name change but that was definitely not my intention.\n\nMy feelings were hurt. I didn\u2019t reply anymore. Thankfully, my daughter saved the day by saying that I meant the gesture out of love and it has always been a special thing that I have a unique nickname for each of my grandchildren. Eventually that topic wasn\u2019t brought up anymore. I\u2019ve seen my son and his family a few times since and I only call my granddaughter her legal name.\n\nHowever, my relationship with my son\u2019s wife was never the same again. She used to take my phone calls and reply to my text messages. Since that day, she stopped answering my calls and would only rarely acknowledge my messages in the WhatsApp group. It has been 3 years. \n\nSomebody asked if I ever apologized for attempting to nickname my granddaughter and of course I didn\u2019t think it necessitated an apology because: 1. I never insisted on using the nickname. 2. It was only my son and his wife who ever objected on me giving their kid a nickname. All my other children openly and kindly let me call their own kids the special nickname I decided on every single time and well into several years.\n\nAITA for nicknaming my granddaughter?\n\nEdit: Since some of you noticed the familiarity of this post, let me make something clear.\n\nI posted on another AITA-related sub before but not on this particular sub. That post was about a related topic but not solely this specific topic which is nicknaming my 9th grandkid. I wanted to see if I\u2019m still TA if my mistake was only to nickname my granddaughter, if it\u2019s an isolated incident, would the verdict be different?", "created_utc": 1689961275, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155urzq/aita_for_giving_my_granddaughter_a_nickname/", "score": 536, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Parents are the one's who name their kids. You are usurping that by choosing a 'nickname.' That's a petty work-a-round that you are playing off as 'cute.' It's actually disrespectful of the new mom.\n2. You got your feelings hurt because someone didn't agree to a *tradition* that *you* started. That's not a tradition, a tradition is hosting Thanksgiving dinner. This is entitled.\n3. You announced your choice of nickname the very next day. That's putting the spotlight on you during *their* special time. And your tactic worked because a new mom had to focus on calling you out for selfish behavior immediately after giving birth.\n4. Nicknames are organic things that come about as a child grows and reflects their personality or something special about them. You choosing one at birth is just weird.\n5. Just because everyone else went along with your entitled behavior, doesn't make it any less entitled. Daughter-in-law just called you on it instead of playing along like you want.", "YTA.", "I can\u2019t imagine why you feel you should get to pick nicknames for your grandchildren. How would you feel if your MIL decided she had the right to give your children their names? And each of them are fish names?", "YTA. It wasn\u2019t a nickname it was an actual name.", "Nicknames are generally an organic thing that happens when you know a person.  Naming a child happens at or around birth and is done by the parents.  This process you have seems to be naming the child, not choosing a nickname, since you do it at birth.  On top of that you make a big production about it, making it about you instead of the child and the new chapter in the life of the parents.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You have unilaterally decided that you would give someone else's kid a new name before you even meet them, and that it was a \"ritual\". Let the people breath for a second.", "YTA. There's nothing wrong with nicknames, but they should be organic. They are usually based on the name, or a term of endearment in your language, or just something that evolves organically when you're talking to the child. It's not just another name that you choose to give the kid because you like the name that you're choosing.", "YTA. What's wrong with calling your grandchildren their actual names?  Why do you have to come up with a different name for them.", "YTA - why is this about you?? Nicknames should be organic, not you \u201cthoughtfully picking it out\u201d. This sounds not like \u201cbut I ONLY picked out a nickname\u201d but more like \u201cmy MiL won\u2019t stay in her lane and this is the final straw\u201d.\n\nThis is not your baby to name in any capacity.", "YTA for announcing it on a family text- did you even clear it first with your DIL and son?  Did you get their approval of it before announcing it to the whole family?  If you want to nickname the baby after being around them as a term of endearment then that\u2019s fine but announcing it in a way where it\u2019s like \u201chere\u2019s the nickname I picked out\u201d is an overstep and if I was the daughter and not consulted first I\u2019d think \u201cwho does she think she is?\u201d.  \n\nHave you even met the baby yet?  If not it just sounds like the whole \u201cnicknaming\u201d thing and the way you\u2019re going about it is a way to make it all about you.", "Yta\n\nEdit: seen your other post, yea confirmed my belief yta. \n\nThe parents get to pick the name of the baby. The way you are wording this, is coming across very bad to me. You are making it about you, and its not. \n\nCan you imagine carrying a baby for 9 months and you and your husband pick out a name you both love and could have a lot of meaning. Just for someone else to \"announce\" a new name for your baby. This is not \"your very special moment\". This is not about you \n\nPlus giving a cute little nickname only you use is one thing. Coming up with the name and announcing it as if you are the parent. And you obviously expect everyone else to call her that too, becuase as you said thats what happened with your other grandchildren\n\nAt the end of the day its the parents choice, you call the child by the name they decide not you. You should have apologized.", "YTA. Was your DIL even aware of this tradition? Had she seen how it goes about? Because I especially understand if, even if she knew about the nicknames, she assumed maybe they came more naturally or with parental approval or even a kind ask. \n\nInstead you just named their kid - and, while you acknowledge in comments that all the other nicknames don\u2019t appear to be legal names, this one not only is one but is a popular one. So maybe she felt blindsided that you just bestowed upon their daughter a new name. Maybe they felt this change was because you don\u2019t like the name they chose? \n\nInstead of asking them privately \u201cper my previous name tradition, I was wondering if youse would be okay with it, and if yes, then I was thinking of this nickname\u201d. Instead you decreed the new name.", "YTA and you've definitely posted this before, I remember the nicknames being fish thing.", "I'm borderline with this one but because you announced your nickname on the family WhatsApp group right after the actual baby was born and their actual name was announced I'm leaning toward YTA. \n\nYou should have been more subtle about it, and waited for a more appropriate time to do it.", "YTA for sure. Did you really think you no one would recognize this story? \n\nWhile I don't remember all the details from your other post, I do remember that the nickname thing was the least egregious thing you described. It was fairly obvious that your DIL's reaction to the nickname was based on her years of interactions with you, not just on this one incident.", "YTA.  The parents don\u2019t have to let you call the kid anything they don\u2019t like. They didn\u2019t ask you to come up with a nickname. You decided that you wanted that. They didn\u2019t. \n\nIf you could\u2019ve let your ego out of the way and just apologized for not consulting them on their feelings about it first, then This would\u2019ve been a no assholes situation. The fact that you let the relationship deteriorate to the point of not speaking for years over them not accepting some nickname you came up is juvenile.", "YTA.  Not everyone likes nicknames.  When my son was born, many people wanted to call him by a common nickname that is short for his real name, but his mother and I don't like that nickname.  We only like the formal name.  Amazing how many people think they have a right to an opinion on someone else's child.", "YTA. You sound entitled to renaming your grandchildren just because it slid before. Did you even ask? Because the way you worded it you just \u201cwent to work\u201d on renaming them. You also waited till the day of the birth to do it? Sounds narcissistic \n#\nI think your DiL is being an AH now, though, because it\u2019s been so long and you did back off and didn\u2019t call the child that. But don\u2019t get me wrong, the actual action that resulted in this situation is definitely AH material\n#\nEdit: maybe you should\u2019ve also apologized to her as well. It didn\u2019t need to be an hour long text begging for forgiveness, but a simple \u201coh I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t think of it like that. I won\u2019t call the child that\u201d", "YTA you don\u2019t get to rename your grandchildren. This is such un over step. This is a special moment for the parents and your making it about you. Should apologize but it\u2019s been 3 years doubt it\u2019d matter.\n\n**Seen that last post OP - YTA definitely the AH and this isn\u2019t the only thing you\u2019ve done to DIL. She\u2019s at the point now she\u2019ll only talk to you via text so she has proof of your inappropriate behavior.", "I have to know what fish species name also doubles as one of the most popular top girl names...", "YTA you know it stop acting stupid.  Now go apologize if you want a relationship.", "As a child whose mother fiercely defended my legal name and did not allow my grandfather to force a nickname as a power/control move, YTA. It's a power play for you. It isnt even anything about the actual flesh and blood child - it is about you.\n\nAnd based on the post/delete/repost in new sub balogna, you are super dooper AH.", "YTA. You get to give your granddaughter a nickname, not a whole ass different name. How did you think this was going to pan out?", "Didn't you post this the other day? Or is it some OTHER grandmother nicknaming kids after fish?", "YTA. I'm sure there's a some cultural specificity here and that you might have meant it in some kind of culturally-specific affectionate way. But the reality is that it's still kind of egotistical, in the sense of this all being so much about you and what's meaningful to you.... You just decided on your own to rename all your grandkids with these nicknames and to make announcements about your alternate nickname you've chosen. It's not surprising that some of the actual parents found it presumptuous and overstepping.", "You already posted about your DIL not wanting to come home for Christmas. In your responses you justified this nickname issue by saying your daughters were always fine with it. \n\nAnd ok, if you had just picked the nickname and offered it and then gone, \u201cok I understand. Sorry if I overstepped\u201d when they said they didn\u2019t want to use the nickname, you\u2019d be fine. But afaik you have yet to apologize or realize your relationship to your DIL is a unique relationship in which you must respect her boundaries instead of just blundering around making assumptions that you can do whatever you want cuz \u201cyour daughters are ok with it,\u201d so YTA.", "lol lol this was posted on the other aita sub recently and op leaves out other issues like she gave her son and his wife a list of names when their son was born, etc. likely not the first and last boundary that was crossed. look it up. it had 1,500 replies calling op TA.", "ESH\n\nYou backed off and didn't use the name when DiL objected so it is ridiculous she is still allowing this to impact your relationship 3 years later.\n\nAnnouncing a nickname the day after a kid is born, and especially using a nickname that is really just a different name, is fairly rude in my opinion.", "YTA - I\u2019m sure you have done everything out of love, no doubt about that, but you are not the child\u2019s parent and you do not have the final say on what they are called. Just because you did the same for previous grandkids does not mean you are entitled to so with future ones. You also picked a nickname that they did not like. Why would they be okay having their child called a name they did not like? Being disappointed is fine, holding a grudge is not. \n\nIf you are interested in a positive relationship with your daughter-in-law (and your new granddaughter) showing her deference and respect with respect to HER family and HER parenting decisions will go a long way. Do not put your son in a position where he will need to choose. If he is smart, he will choose her.", "YTA\n\nNo matter what your intentions were, you are the grandparent, not the parent and this was an overstep, and likely was an overstep every time you did it with your previous grandchildren. Choosing the child's name is a precious and important thing for parents. They choose the full name, and they choose any nickname the child is called by, at least until the child is old enough to decide for themselves. So if they say they are naming the child Annaliese and calling her Annie, then that's what you need to call her, and you need to put on a big bright smile and be all for the team about it, not say you are going to pick out another name for THEIR BABY. I think you were correct to completely back off and always call the baby by their correct name. I wonder if you should reach out to your son and DIL and apologize and ask what you might do to mend fences? The fact that your relationship cooled significantly after this and you still to this day are digging in your heels and choosing not to apologize... well, that's on you.", " Naming the kids after fish is pretty weird.  I mean, I know it's in your own language but calling them the equivalent of Guppy, Koi, Beta, Cichlid, Goby, Angelfish, Clownfish, etc, would not lead me, if I were your daughter-in-law, to look forward to learning that you're going to call my newborn daughter Goldfish.   \n\n I would not want my child to be nicknamed after something that gets flushed down the toilet after you find it floating belly up one morning.  I would object.\n\nHowever, if that's all it took to irreparably damage your relationship with your daughter-in-law, that is a bit weird.      Question: Were you on good terms with your daughter-in-law before, or was this the final straw that broke the camel's back?  \n\nMy judgement here is:  Not Enough Info", "YTA for all reasons mentioned. I can\u2019t help but notice you refer to her as \u201cson\u2019s wife\u201d and never DIL .. do you not see her as your DIL? Is that apparent through texts and actions?", "\n\nQuestion: Would DIL have been ok with a nickname that didn't sound like you completely renamed her?\n\nShe would have known by the 9th grandchild that it's your thing -- so why didn't they ask you before the baby was born not to assign an unusual nickname? Your son didn't know this would be an issue?\n\nBUT if her primary objection was that it sounded like you were giving the baby a different name completely, you should have apologized.

Info here is way skewed ~~NAH, though I think there are missteps all around. I do personally think it is a bit odd to have designated nicknames for all your grand children, but not particularly harmful. If I had been in your DILs position I may have considered approaching you during the pregnancy and asking you to not do a nickname. She knew this was coming, based on the other 8 grandchildren. I also think you are stealing the spotlight a bit from them, they had their child, announced the name, and less than 24 hours later you are revealing your \"special\" name. Presumably without even ever meeting the child! You have respected their wishes and (info?) not complained about this to anyone.

Not a single person has/will call him that only me. I don't believe op is wrong at all and think it's great that when her dil said not to call her that she respected her. When my oldest was born I told everyone they were not allowed to shorten her name (it's a very common name that's gender neutral) bc I had named her blah blah blah not blah.

I\u2019d bet that once your granddaughter is old enough, she\u2019s gonna realize she doesn\u2019t have a nickname and will probably feel left out.\n\nEdit: totally have changed my mind here. Going to go with YTA. Sounds like you\u2019ve overstepped with this DIL previously and are either willingly ignoring or are oblivious to how you have tried to push things on her through the years.

Most of my grandkids are now in their teens. I still call the teens the same nicknames I gave them as newborns.\n\nThere\u2019s a WhatsApp group with me and my husband, our children and their spouses where we exchange photos and other updates. When my 9th grandchild was born, I was very excited when my son announced her name in the evening. I spent that night thinking what nickname she should have. It\u2019s a very special moment for me. The following day, I greeted everyone in the WhatsApp group and announced the nickname I chose for my granddaughter and said I hoped they all loved it as much as I did. \n\nI nicknamed each of my granddaughters after a colorful fish species from my native language, not the English version.\n\nMy son\u2019s wife immediately replied in the group text that they have carefully chosen my granddaughter\u2019s legal name and everyone would be calling her that and the nickname I chose sounded too much like a name change instead of an endearing nickname. Admittedly, the nickname I picked has been consistently on the \u201ctop girl names\u201d list in my language in the last 3 years so I guess it\u2019s valid for her to assume it sounded like a name change but that was definitely not my intention.\n\nMy feelings were hurt. I didn\u2019t reply anymore. Thankfully, my daughter saved the day by saying that I meant the gesture out of love and it has always been a special thing that I have a unique nickname for each of my grandchildren. Eventually that topic wasn\u2019t brought up anymore. I\u2019ve seen my son and his family a few times since and I only call my granddaughter her legal name.\n\nHowever, my relationship with my son\u2019s wife was never the same again. She used to take my phone calls and reply to my text messages. Since that day, she stopped answering my calls and would only rarely acknowledge my messages in the WhatsApp group. It has been 3 years. \n\nSomebody asked if I ever apologized for attempting to nickname my granddaughter and of course I didn\u2019t think it necessitated an apology because: 1. I never insisted on using the nickname. 2. It was only my son and his wife who ever objected on me giving their kid a nickname. All my other children openly and kindly let me call their own kids the special nickname I decided on every single time and well into several years.\n\nAITA for nicknaming my granddaughter?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And it's not \"obligatory\" thing - his cousin, with whom he is very near, has not any nickname and everybody refers to him just by his given name, but his niece's husband, whom we met first time a year ago, got his nickname immediately after telling us an anecdote, how his name was pronounciated in the country they are living now. I've got mine during the family camping trip (and I'm wearing it proudly ;) ), but my SO, however he is \"the blood family\" hasn't (sometimes they call us both the plural from my nickname).   \nGiving \"artificial\" , not connected in any way with the child, nicknames to the grandchildren is just... dumb.   \nOP just wants to make it all about her - YTA.", "Or maybe it's something like El Salm\u00f3n", "Abused children never stop wanting a better relationship with their abusive parent. Your justification for everything is 'my daughters let me do it\", 'my daughters like/love it/me\". Just because abuse is normalized doesn't mean it isn't still abuse. You have meddled and made yourself the center of your children's world for so long and stomped all over their free agency and autonomy for so long that to them...it is NORMAL! They have no concept of being able to live free of your input and control! It is NOT NORMAL to insert and assert your wants and needs unto other people, demanding that your wants and needs matter and theirs do not. Why else would you get so bent out of shape when DIL refused to allow you to reorganize HER kitchen. You think you are above boundaries and your children are not only your property and possessions, but they are here to serve you. In reality, the only reason your daughters don't object is because you've brainwashed them not to object and the reason your son is no longer drinking from that cup is because his wife showed him that they not only can live without your input and control, they can thrive!", "I mean I live in Ireland so it's only when I travel or work outside of the country that I get this shite.", "Maybe they felt you overstepped your boundaries. Wether you meant it out of kindness or not you can make people uncomfortable", "YTA ESH", "YTA - you\u2019re not the main character here, stop trying to make everything about you", "YTA My FIL has a nickname for my daughter and I f#$%ing hate it", "Another entitled MIL who is rude to her DIL and just dosen't understand why on earth would her DIL ignore out of the blue when she's only been kind and worried \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\n\nMate, fuck off. MILs like you are a bane to the society!!! YTA you little disrespectful old woman.", "This woman is wild. She behaved terribly, got told she was the asshole, and is now trying to live in delusion with this more edited \"relatable/sympathetic\" post (admittedly she's doing a poor job).\n\nI find it so shameful when people use this subreddit to ask a tough question that they don't want to be answered. This isn't a validation for the weak minded subreddit.", "YTA for the reasons everyone here have stated . I hope DIL sees this and posts in j/nomil.", "A special granny 'nickname' would be okay but this isnt a nickname. She renamed the baby from a top ten list of names from her country. Shes not even met the baby yet and has decided to deliberately not call her by her name. \nI agree with your stance on nicknames, it's just that this isnt one. Theres no riff on the original, no events, no shortening like Elizabeth being turned into Lizzy or Beth. Shes just outright decided on a name.", "YTA.  They are pushing you away because you keep overstepping boundaries.  They are the parents.  They get to decide everything about their children.  You have no rights.  But you keep trying to.  Stop already. And apologize.", "YTA \n\nFirst of all, the son and dil were literally THE BABY\u2019S PARENTS of course you need to apologise they clearly felt personally insulted  \n\nAnd second of all literally all of your other granddaughters were nicknamed after FISH but by your own admission the new one you gave not just an actual name but one literally from top of the list of the most POPULAR BABY NAMES IN YOUR WHOLE FREAKING COUNTRY!!!!!????!!!!!\n\nSeriously why not just another fish and how is that not a complete name change it\u2019s literally a completely different name to her birth name? And why do you get to pick nicknames anyway? It sounds really disrespectful to tell all of your adult children \u201csorry but I\u2019m not calling them by the name you spent likely months picking out because it means something to you instead me and the whole family will be calling them something different instead because what I want is more important to me and they are enabling me so there\u201d. This has majorly controlling vibes here.", "All other history or other posts aside- and as you ask, just on the nicknaming of your 9th grandchild:\n\n'Announcing'  for a child another name (nickname or otherwise)  that you will call them instead of their given name in a what'sapp the day after their own name has been revealed to the family by their parents is at best tactless and insensitive. It is dimissive and self centred.\n\nIt might not seem this way to you I realise or have been your intention, but 'its what I do every time', or with all my grandchildren does not make it ok. \n\nAlso, in a wider context. Nicknames and special inside jokes, concessions, traditions and affections aren't contrived like this, especially for people coming into the family who may not have grown up with it just as a thing, like your DIL. No matter what the history for you, they can't be forced and instead are best when they evolve organically, or come from a genuine warmth in a relationship.. not entitlement through status.", "YTA - Your traditions don\u2019t matter to new parents, it\u2019s their child, and until that child says differently, their name is what their parents gave them.", "YTA. Why make it a big announcement. Like it\u2019s on par with announcing the kids\u2019 birth or real name? Why not just call them the nickname? That\u2019s how nicknames usually work. It\u2019s not a premeditated thing you are just around that person and something about that person makes you want to start calling them the nickname. Your tradition is weird and feels like a scene stealing kind of move. I understand why your daughter in law doesn\u2019t like it. The rest of your family went along with it probably because their used to tolerating you, but your daughter in law doesn\u2019t have that history with you so she rightly does not feel the need to coddle you.", "You sound insufferable. Who are you to arrogantly rename, and this is what you are doing, someone\u2019s child?\nYTA.", "I never understood the emphasis on 'choosing' nicknames. IMO, no one necessarily needs one, and the only time they feel authentic is when it just happens organically.\n\nYTA", "YTA you don\u2019t announce a nickname, they happen organically. You were essentially stealing the limelight, renaming a child and making it about you.", "You need to get a life. You've finally found someone who stands up to you.  I wish they go no contact on you.  It is MIL like these who gives MILs bad reputations. They can't get a life of their own,  they want to play mommy again in the pretense of \"it's just a nickname.\"\nBuy clothes, babysit if asked just be I don't know, a normal grandmother.\nJust because your other kids had no issues with your weirdness  doesn't mean there is no issues. May be they are just blind to your overbearing borderline abusive ass.", "Nicknames are also things that just happen spontaneously right? Something addressed to someone seems more like a name you\u2019re assigning\u2026idk seems strange to me but idk your culture \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA and I\u2019m going to say something that I haven\u2019t seen someone else say (they may have but I haven\u2019t seen it) I don\u2019t think any of them are nicknames I personally think you just renamed all your grandkids and for some strange reason everyone went along with it. You don\u2019t think up nicknames before people are born they are earned by a quirk of some kind I would have said at the start no nicknames if you want to name a kid go and have one.", "Oof. I was about to say NTA because I do the same thing to my nephews and nieces. But those were rather silly ones close to their names, which the kids find hilarious that they actively think of better and more fitting nicknames for themselves, even bragging to their friends of our tradition. Anyway, thanks for the factcheck.", "You are nice, I'd be going NC, based on what I've read she did to this poor family.", "According to the link someone included, you posted on /r/AITAH \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/152ex24/aita_for_not_being_able_to_recall_how_i_68f/", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23, shep, what is that even SMH."]}
