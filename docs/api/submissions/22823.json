{"id": 22823, "submission_id": "155urzq", "title": "AITA for giving my granddaughter a nickname?", "selftext": "When I first became a grandmother, I started the tradition of picking nicknames for my grandchildren. Most of my grandkids are now in their teens. I still call the teens the same nicknames I gave them as newborns.\n\nThere\u2019s a WhatsApp group with me and my husband, our children and their spouses where we exchange photos and other updates. When my 9th grandchild was born, I was very excited when my son announced her name in the evening. I spent that night thinking what nickname she should have. It\u2019s a very special moment for me. The following day, I greeted everyone in the WhatsApp group and announced the nickname I chose for my granddaughter and said I hoped they all loved it as much as I did. \n\nI nicknamed each of my granddaughters after a colorful fish species from my native language, not the English version.\n\nMy son\u2019s wife immediately replied in the group text that they have carefully chosen my granddaughter\u2019s legal name and everyone would be calling her that and the nickname I chose sounded too much like a name change instead of an endearing nickname. Admittedly, the nickname I picked has been consistently on the \u201ctop girl names\u201d list in my language in the last 3 years so I guess it\u2019s valid for her to assume it sounded like a name change but that was definitely not my intention.\n\nMy feelings were hurt. I didn\u2019t reply anymore. Thankfully, my daughter saved the day by saying that I meant the gesture out of love and it has always been a special thing that I have a unique nickname for each of my grandchildren. Eventually that topic wasn\u2019t brought up anymore. I\u2019ve seen my son and his family a few times since and I only call my granddaughter her legal name.\n\nHowever, my relationship with my son\u2019s wife was never the same again. She used to take my phone calls and reply to my text messages. Since that day, she stopped answering my calls and would only rarely acknowledge my messages in the WhatsApp group. It has been 3 years. \n\nSomebody asked if I ever apologized for attempting to nickname my granddaughter and of course I didn\u2019t think it necessitated an apology because: 1. I never insisted on using the nickname. 2. It was only my son and his wife who ever objected on me giving their kid a nickname. All my other children openly and kindly let me call their own kids the special nickname I decided on every single time and well into several years.\n\nAITA for nicknaming my granddaughter?\n\nEdit: Since some of you noticed the familiarity of this post, let me make something clear.\n\nI posted on another AITA-related sub before but not on this particular sub. That post was about a related topic but not solely this specific topic which is nicknaming my 9th grandkid. I wanted to see if I\u2019m still TA if my mistake was only to nickname my granddaughter, if it\u2019s an isolated incident, would the verdict be different?", "created_utc": 1689961275, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155urzq/aita_for_giving_my_granddaughter_a_nickname/", "score": 242, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Parents are the one's who name their kids. You are usurping that by choosing a 'nickname.' That's a petty work-a-round that you are playing off as 'cute.' It's actually disrespectful of the new mom.\n2. You got your feelings hurt because someone didn't agree to a *tradition* that *you* started. That's not a tradition, a tradition is hosting Thanksgiving dinner. This is entitled.\n3. You announced your choice of nickname the very next day. That's putting the spotlight on you during *their* special time. And your tactic worked because a new mom had to focus on calling you out for selfish behavior immediately after giving birth.\n4. Nicknames are organic things that come about as a child grows and reflects their personality or something special about them. You choosing one at birth is just weird.\n5. Just because everyone else went along with your entitled behavior, doesn't make it any less entitled. Daughter-in-law just called you on it instead of playing along like you want.", "YTA.", "I can\u2019t imagine why you feel you should get to pick nicknames for your grandchildren. How would you feel if your MIL decided she had the right to give your children their names? And each of them are fish names?", "YTA. It wasn\u2019t a nickname it was an actual name.", "Nicknames are generally an organic thing that happens when you know a person.  Naming a child happens at or around birth and is done by the parents.  This process you have seems to be naming the child, not choosing a nickname, since you do it at birth.  On top of that you make a big production about it, making it about you instead of the child and the new chapter in the life of the parents.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You have unilaterally decided that you would give someone else's kid a new name before you even meet them, and that it was a \"ritual\". Let the people breath for a second.", "YTA. There's nothing wrong with nicknames, but they should be organic. They are usually based on the name, or a term of endearment in your language, or just something that evolves organically when you're talking to the child. It's not just another name that you choose to give the kid because you like the name that you're choosing.", "YTA. What's wrong with calling your grandchildren their actual names?  Why do you have to come up with a different name for them.", "YTA - why is this about you?? Nicknames should be organic, not you \u201cthoughtfully picking it out\u201d. This sounds not like \u201cbut I ONLY picked out a nickname\u201d but more like \u201cmy MiL won\u2019t stay in her lane and this is the final straw\u201d.\n\nThis is not your baby to name in any capacity.", "YTA for announcing it on a family text- did you even clear it first with your DIL and son?  Did you get their approval of it before announcing it to the whole family?  If you want to nickname the baby after being around them as a term of endearment then that\u2019s fine but announcing it in a way where it\u2019s like \u201chere\u2019s the nickname I picked out\u201d is an overstep and if I was the daughter and not consulted first I\u2019d think \u201cwho does she think she is?\u201d.  \n\nHave you even met the baby yet?  If not it just sounds like the whole \u201cnicknaming\u201d thing and the way you\u2019re going about it is a way to make it all about you.", "Yta\n\nEdit: seen your other post, yea confirmed my belief yta. \n\nThe parents get to pick the name of the baby. The way you are wording this, is coming across very bad to me. You are making it about you, and its not. \n\nCan you imagine carrying a baby for 9 months and you and your husband pick out a name you both love and could have a lot of meaning. Just for someone else to \"announce\" a new name for your baby. This is not \"your very special moment\". This is not about you \n\nPlus giving a cute little nickname only you use is one thing. Coming up with the name and announcing it as if you are the parent. And you obviously expect everyone else to call her that too, becuase as you said thats what happened with your other grandchildren\n\nAt the end of the day its the parents choice, you call the child by the name they decide not you. You should have apologized.", "YTA. Was your DIL even aware of this tradition? Had she seen how it goes about? Because I especially understand if, even if she knew about the nicknames, she assumed maybe they came more naturally or with parental approval or even a kind ask. \n\nInstead you just named their kid - and, while you acknowledge in comments that all the other nicknames don\u2019t appear to be legal names, this one not only is one but is a popular one. So maybe she felt blindsided that you just bestowed upon their daughter a new name. Maybe they felt this change was because you don\u2019t like the name they chose? \n\nInstead of asking them privately \u201cper my previous name tradition, I was wondering if youse would be okay with it, and if yes, then I was thinking of this nickname\u201d. Instead you decreed the new name.", "YTA and you've definitely posted this before, I remember the nicknames being fish thing.", "I'm borderline with this one but because you announced your nickname on the family WhatsApp group right after the actual baby was born and their actual name was announced I'm leaning toward YTA. \n\nYou should have been more subtle about it, and waited for a more appropriate time to do it.", "YTA for sure. Did you really think you no one would recognize this story? \n\nWhile I don't remember all the details from your other post, I do remember that the nickname thing was the least egregious thing you described. It was fairly obvious that your DIL's reaction to the nickname was based on her years of interactions with you, not just on this one incident.", "YTA.  The parents don\u2019t have to let you call the kid anything they don\u2019t like. They didn\u2019t ask you to come up with a nickname. You decided that you wanted that. They didn\u2019t. \n\nIf you could\u2019ve let your ego out of the way and just apologized for not consulting them on their feelings about it first, then This would\u2019ve been a no assholes situation. The fact that you let the relationship deteriorate to the point of not speaking for years over them not accepting some nickname you came up is juvenile.", "YTA.  Not everyone likes nicknames.  When my son was born, many people wanted to call him by a common nickname that is short for his real name, but his mother and I don't like that nickname.  We only like the formal name.  Amazing how many people think they have a right to an opinion on someone else's child.", "YTA. You sound entitled to renaming your grandchildren just because it slid before. Did you even ask? Because the way you worded it you just \u201cwent to work\u201d on renaming them. You also waited till the day of the birth to do it? Sounds narcissistic \n#\nI think your DiL is being an AH now, though, because it\u2019s been so long and you did back off and didn\u2019t call the child that. But don\u2019t get me wrong, the actual action that resulted in this situation is definitely AH material\n#\nEdit: maybe you should\u2019ve also apologized to her as well. It didn\u2019t need to be an hour long text begging for forgiveness, but a simple \u201coh I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t think of it like that. I won\u2019t call the child that\u201d", "YTA you don\u2019t get to rename your grandchildren. This is such un over step. This is a special moment for the parents and your making it about you. Should apologize but it\u2019s been 3 years doubt it\u2019d matter.\n\n**Seen that last post OP - YTA definitely the AH and this isn\u2019t the only thing you\u2019ve done to DIL. She\u2019s at the point now she\u2019ll only talk to you via text so she has proof of your inappropriate behavior.", "I have to know what fish species name also doubles as one of the most popular top girl names...", "YTA you know it stop acting stupid.  Now go apologize if you want a relationship.", "As a child whose mother fiercely defended my legal name and did not allow my grandfather to force a nickname as a power/control move, YTA. It's a power play for you. It isnt even anything about the actual flesh and blood child - it is about you.\n\nAnd based on the post/delete/repost in new sub balogna, you are super dooper AH.", "YTA. You get to give your granddaughter a nickname, not a whole ass different name. How did you think this was going to pan out?", "Didn't you post this the other day? Or is it some OTHER grandmother nicknaming kids after fish?", "YTA. I'm sure there's a some cultural specificity here and that you might have meant it in some kind of culturally-specific affectionate way. But the reality is that it's still kind of egotistical, in the sense of this all being so much about you and what's meaningful to you.... You just decided on your own to rename all your grandkids with these nicknames and to make announcements about your alternate nickname you've chosen. It's not surprising that some of the actual parents found it presumptuous and overstepping.", "You already posted about your DIL not wanting to come home for Christmas. In your responses you justified this nickname issue by saying your daughters were always fine with it. \n\nAnd ok, if you had just picked the nickname and offered it and then gone, \u201cok I understand. Sorry if I overstepped\u201d when they said they didn\u2019t want to use the nickname, you\u2019d be fine. But afaik you have yet to apologize or realize your relationship to your DIL is a unique relationship in which you must respect her boundaries instead of just blundering around making assumptions that you can do whatever you want cuz \u201cyour daughters are ok with it,\u201d so YTA.", "lol lol this was posted on the other aita sub recently and op leaves out other issues like she gave her son and his wife a list of names when their son was born, etc. likely not the first and last boundary that was crossed. look it up. it had 1,500 replies calling op TA.", "ESH\n\nYou backed off and didn't use the name when DiL objected so it is ridiculous she is still allowing this to impact your relationship 3 years later.\n\nAnnouncing a nickname the day after a kid is born, and especially using a nickname that is really just a different name, is fairly rude in my opinion.", "YTA - I\u2019m sure you have done everything out of love, no doubt about that, but you are not the child\u2019s parent and you do not have the final say on what they are called. Just because you did the same for previous grandkids does not mean you are entitled to so with future ones. You also picked a nickname that they did not like. Why would they be okay having their child called a name they did not like? Being disappointed is fine, holding a grudge is not. \n\nIf you are interested in a positive relationship with your daughter-in-law (and your new granddaughter) showing her deference and respect with respect to HER family and HER parenting decisions will go a long way. Do not put your son in a position where he will need to choose. If he is smart, he will choose her.", "YTA\n\nNo matter what your intentions were, you are the grandparent, not the parent and this was an overstep, and likely was an overstep every time you did it with your previous grandchildren. Choosing the child's name is a precious and important thing for parents. They choose the full name, and they choose any nickname the child is called by, at least until the child is old enough to decide for themselves. So if they say they are naming the child Annaliese and calling her Annie, then that's what you need to call her, and you need to put on a big bright smile and be all for the team about it, not say you are going to pick out another name for THEIR BABY. I think you were correct to completely back off and always call the baby by their correct name. I wonder if you should reach out to your son and DIL and apologize and ask what you might do to mend fences? The fact that your relationship cooled significantly after this and you still to this day are digging in your heels and choosing not to apologize... well, that's on you.", " Naming the kids after fish is pretty weird.  I mean, I know it's in your own language but calling them the equivalent of Guppy, Koi, Beta, Cichlid, Goby, Angelfish, Clownfish, etc, would not lead me, if I were your daughter-in-law, to look forward to learning that you're going to call my newborn daughter Goldfish.   \n\n I would not want my child to be nicknamed after something that gets flushed down the toilet after you find it floating belly up one morning.  I would object.\n\nHowever, if that's all it took to irreparably damage your relationship with your daughter-in-law, that is a bit weird.      Question: Were you on good terms with your daughter-in-law before, or was this the final straw that broke the camel's back?  \n\nMy judgement here is:  Not Enough Info", "YTA for all reasons mentioned. I can\u2019t help but notice you refer to her as \u201cson\u2019s wife\u201d and never DIL .. do you not see her as your DIL? Is that apparent through texts and actions?", "\n\nQuestion: Would DIL have been ok with a nickname that didn't sound like you completely renamed her?\n\nShe would have known by the 9th grandchild that it's your thing -- so why didn't they ask you before the baby was born not to assign an unusual nickname? Your son didn't know this would be an issue?\n\nBUT if her primary objection was that it sounded like you were giving the baby a different name completely, you should have apologized.

Info here is way skewed ~~NAH, though I think there are missteps all around. I do personally think it is a bit odd to have designated nicknames for all your grand children, but not particularly harmful. If I had been in your DILs position I may have considered approaching you during the pregnancy and asking you to not do a nickname. She knew this was coming, based on the other 8 grandchildren. I also think you are stealing the spotlight a bit from them, they had their child, announced the name, and less than 24 hours later you are revealing your \"special\" name. Presumably without even ever meeting the child! You have respected their wishes and (info?) not complained about this to anyone.

Not a single person has/will call him that only me. I don't believe op is wrong at all and think it's great that when her dil said not to call her that she respected her. When my oldest was born I told everyone they were not allowed to shorten her name (it's a very common name that's gender neutral) bc I had named her blah blah blah not blah.

I\u2019d bet that once your granddaughter is old enough, she\u2019s gonna realize she doesn\u2019t have a nickname and will probably feel left out.\n\nEdit: totally have changed my mind here. Going to go with YTA. Sounds like you\u2019ve overstepped with this DIL previously and are either willingly ignoring or are oblivious to how you have tried to push things on her through the years.

Most of my grandkids are now in their teens. I still call the teens the same nicknames I gave them as newborns.\n\nThere\u2019s a WhatsApp group with me and my husband, our children and their spouses where we exchange photos and other updates. When my 9th grandchild was born, I was very excited when my son announced her name in the evening. I spent that night thinking what nickname she should have. It\u2019s a very special moment for me. The following day, I greeted everyone in the WhatsApp group and announced the nickname I chose for my granddaughter and said I hoped they all loved it as much as I did. \n\nI nicknamed each of my granddaughters after a colorful fish species from my native language, not the English version.\n\nMy son\u2019s wife immediately replied in the group text that they have carefully chosen my granddaughter\u2019s legal name and everyone would be calling her that and the nickname I chose sounded too much like a name change instead of an endearing nickname. Admittedly, the nickname I picked has been consistently on the \u201ctop girl names\u201d list in my language in the last 3 years so I guess it\u2019s valid for her to assume it sounded like a name change but that was definitely not my intention.\n\nMy feelings were hurt. I didn\u2019t reply anymore. Thankfully, my daughter saved the day by saying that I meant the gesture out of love and it has always been a special thing that I have a unique nickname for each of my grandchildren. Eventually that topic wasn\u2019t brought up anymore. I\u2019ve seen my son and his family a few times since and I only call my granddaughter her legal name.\n\nHowever, my relationship with my son\u2019s wife was never the same again. She used to take my phone calls and reply to my text messages. Since that day, she stopped answering my calls and would only rarely acknowledge my messages in the WhatsApp group. It has been 3 years. \n\nSomebody asked if I ever apologized for attempting to nickname my granddaughter and of course I didn\u2019t think it necessitated an apology because: 1. I never insisted on using the nickname. 2. It was only my son and his wife who ever objected on me giving their kid a nickname. All my other children openly and kindly let me call their own kids the special nickname I decided on every single time and well into several years.\n\nAITA for nicknaming my granddaughter?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
