You're absolutely right, your mental health should always come first. It's not easy to be in such situations, but sometimes it's better to keep distance with people who can't see your struggles or be supportive.", "Haven\u2019t been able to see her in the last month bc of insurance issues but she was always big on that. Think about what YOU think and not others. Sadly anxiety makes that quite hadd", "I just didn\u2019t want to leave it open-ended to where she couldnt start a fight about it that would drag out. I don\u2019t hate her, people make mistakes and relationships ware thin sometimes but I don\u2019t hate her. Learned the last few years that hating someone is pointless; easier to delete them from your brain", "Couldn\u2019t agree more myself thank you a lot", "What did she do wrong? She confided in her family her friend had been suicidal. That's not something someone, especially a young person can carry alone. OP doesn't have to go to her wedding but i don't think she deserves the response you think she does.", "No birthday texts for 2 years, no condolences when close friends passed away, nothing.

You say you can sense pity very well, but that's just the shit that overly sensitive people say to justify themselves making up other peoples motives.", "Yea guess that\u2019s a good point.

I've got severe mental health problems thanks including CPTSD. Doesn't mean everything is about me. You can be mental and still be in the wrong.", "Then I guess you\u2019re just an arse. To not see trust was broken when she started confrontation with me and her family is crazy. Go be a contrarian elsewhere", "I'm not being a contrarian. You came here for judgements, but you're upset to receive one which asks you to consider your own behaviour. She told her family about your suicidal ideation, and whilst I can see why you felt aggrieved by that, that is the price you pay when you confide in someone about that. That's a heavy load to ask someone to carry and require them to not confide in anyone else. Whilst her behaviour may have wrongs in the specifics I don't think this is the worst thing she could have done."]}
