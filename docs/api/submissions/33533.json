You're going to likely need that police report to dispute the fraudulent credit card charges.  If you don't you will likely be held liable for them.  That's not a small amount of money.

That\u2019s a large amount of money, and it gets even bigger when you consider the higher interest rates you and he would have due to his damaged credit.  She needs to be held accountable.

Speaking from firsthand experience, when someone does this to family it\u2019s a double kick in the teeth \u20261-they stole from you /him and messed up his credit score\u2026.2- they did it expecting they could play the sympathy card and get away with it having absolutely no respect or consideration for your husband.\nAlso IF they\u2019re allowed to get away with it they will continue those behaviors until one day they do something far more drastic to someone who has zero connection to them or care for what happens to them ..!!!\nI tried telling my best friends gf this regarding her son who was pulling similar crap but she chose to cover again and again for him till a few months ago when the police came knocking and arrested him on armed home invasion charges!!!\nIf she\u2019d had let him learn back when it was \u2018just\u2019 stealing family members credit card he may MAY have learned his lesson with a short county bid but now he\u2019s looking at 2-5 yrs MINIMUM", "NTA\n\nThey aren't offering to repay you for the money that your husband now owes. Even if she or they repaid the money, it's not going to undo the credit score damage. The credit score staying messed up will screw up opportunities for you & your husband for years to come. It'll make it harder to access jobs, housing, cars, & other needs. Having those be harder to get or cost more is only going to snowball into other things costing more in the long run. \n Reporting it to police, filing charges, & getting things corrected through the legal system should erase the debt & fix the damage that it did to the score.

She clearly has no remorse for her actions and needs a wake up call that your in-laws are not willing to give her.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you have to deal with such disgusting behavior.  That\u2019s a level of betrayal most of us only see on TV."]}
