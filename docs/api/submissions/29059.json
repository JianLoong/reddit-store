My mom\u2019s immediate reaction was \u201clet us know if you change your mind and want us to come to the hospital!\u201d Even though for weeks I said I didn\u2019t want anyone at the hospital. Then she said she was packing and said \u201cwe are coming of course! But not to the hospital.\u201d They assumed they could wait at my house. I said no.\n\nAfter 21 hours of labor and 3 hours of pushing, my son was born and we let my parents know. Immediately they were asking for photos. I understand they are excited and already love him, but holy shit I felt they were being needy and not respecting that I was tired, talking to hospital staff, trying to learn to breastfeed, etc.\n\nOnce we got moved to a recovery room, my husband  and I talked and decided to hold off on sending pictures to anyone, including to his favorite two people (his dad and grandmother) so it\u2019s not like my parents were being singled out. I can\u2019t really even explain why we don\u2019t want to send pics of our son out right now. We both just have some anxiety about sending a photo to someone and then that photo spreading like wild fire to people we did not consent to having a photo of our son sent to so we\u2019ve just decided to hold off. Not forever, but for now. We\u2019ve literally already talked about how excited we are to send our first Christmas cards this year! So this isn\u2019t a forever thing. \n\nMy parents lost their minds. Blew up both our phones, stressed me out to the point of tears so husband called my dad to ask them to stop and my dad had the balls to hang up on my husband and then my dad tells me that him and husband don\u2019t need to speak or see each other again. \n\nwhen I was discharged and sent home I sent my parents three texts about us being home and asking to FaceTime them so they could see my son via video since we weren\u2019t doing photos. They ignored me. \n\nWe finally FaceTimed yesterday and my mom told me she had been sobbing all day and it was \u201ctorture\u201d waiting for a photo. I told her she made my labor all about her and that no one asked me and husband what we wanted. It was all about what they wanted. They said they don\u2019t understand the photo thing. Everyone else in the world sends photos of new babies. I said I don\u2019t care about the world and I totally see how sending a photo seems like no big deal and our decision seems irrational but you don\u2019t have to understand it. You just have to respect it. Well that didn\u2019t go over well. \n\nSo tell me the truth, am I being dramatic? Am I the AH? My mom said I probably cried in the recovery room not because they stressed me out but because I was just hormonal and tired. \n\nBe honest with me, are my husband and I drawing a hard line over something nonsensical?", "created_utc": 1697493223, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179hwwh/aita_for_not_sending_out_photos_of_my_newborn/", "score": 554, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Girl you gotta give it back to them. Go hard. They have no right to treat you like this. I would be doing the same thing if I was in your shoes. You are the mum what you say goes. They suck it up and deal with it\n\nNta and congrats mumma!", "Grandbaby photos are serious currency in the grandma boasting scene. Your mother *really* really wants to dunk on all her friends; she thinks that 'everyone' circulates baby photos because all her friends do, and she has likely been promising them pictures. And you are correct: any picture she gets will be circulated far and wide within moments of her receiving it. Her refusal of the facetime offer proves that she's not interested in seeing or meeting her grandchild, it is in having grandbaby IP to upload. I'd hold the line. NTA", "NTA \n\nYou're mom and dad now - congratulations! You get to make the rules of your household and about sharing pictures of your kid as wild as you please. These are very normal feelings to have. Youre good!\n\nShe's minimizing what you went through. She is basically telling you your thoughts and feelings don't matter. \n\nNot today Satan. You and your husband do you. Stand strong. They'll come crawling back if they want a place in their grandkids life - on YOUR terms. \n\nYou're mom and dad now. Your rules are the rules. They can have whatever feelings they want over them. They're still the rules.", "NTA. Take it from someone whose in-laws had a similarly hysterical reaction to boundaries around a newborn: now is the time for you and your husband to stand your ground and insist your parents respect your wishes, otherwise they will act this way every time you don't do things they way they want you to.", "NTA, I find it a bit odd that you/your husband weren't sending pictures to parents/grandparents during a settled time in the hospital. It sounds like you are close to them so seems a bit odd they you couldn't request they keep the photos just for them and not share it.\n\nMe not understanding that doesn't mean it's an AH thing to do though. Not getting a picture isn't torture. People are supposed to be supporting a couple who just had a new baby, not adding to stress.", "NTA. It\u2019s frustrating how entitled people feel to other people\u2019s children.", "NTA. You just created a human being. Your parents can wait a little bit before seeing a photo. Grandparents survived for thousands of years without being able to see instant photos of their grandchildren when they were born, your parents can wait a few days. You can send out the pics of your child whenever you want for whatever reason you want. \n\nAnd your parents didn\u2019t just get mad about it getting instant gratification - they went to emotional manipulation immediately. Keep in mind - this is probably a snapshot of your relationship with them in the future when they don\u2019t get what they want when they want it. So it\u2019s good that you held your ground now - set the boundaries now and let them know you will *not* be manipulated or ordered around.", "NTA I\u2019ve had plenty of friends who have had children and haven\u2019t sent out photos and asked for no visitors for a few weeks to get settled. When you were born there was probably no internet so they didn\u2019t have to worry about sending out pictures the minute the baby pops out. Birth is not a spectator sport so you have no obligations to your or your husbands family.", "Congratulations!!! NTA in any way shape or form. You have the right to set whatever boundaries you want. I get your parents were over excited about their new grandchild, that is allowed as well to an extent. Also if your father wants to see your son, he then has to see your husband as a stipulation. Honestly tell them, you are going low contact and that you will contact them again when you are 1) fully healed, 2) have had time to bond with your baby and more settled at home. Until then they can wait to see their grandchild while they chill out. If they pitch a fit, let them know that they won't see their grandchild until they can act like adults. Once they do get to see him, put a firm boundary that no photos are to go on Social Media unless approved by you", "NTA...this is YOUR child (congratulations!), not theirs! You as parents get to decide when or if to share pics! \n\nAs a grandparent of 13, I understand the excitement over a new grandchild...but your parents using the argument that \"everyone shares pictures\" smacks of immaturity...literally, my first thought was \"if everyone was jumping off a bridge...\"! \n\nThey truly are making it about their \"needs\" and not yours...it would be sad if they chose this as their hill for your relationship to die on, but you are NTAs for standing up for your rights as parents...best of luck to you!", "NTA. This is the downside of modern technology and instant information. People don't want to wait.  The birth of your son was not about your parents. They are extended family. This was a time for you, your husband and your son and quite frankly, your parents were very selfish to not respect your boundaries and try to make it about them. Congrats on your new blessing!", "You're NTA for any of this. Your baby, your decision. And if your hormones did play into your reaction to *some* degree \u2013 that's fine! You just birthed an entire human.\n\nSome of your parents' reaction, I can empathise with. They were excited and possibly worried, too (I know I would be if I didn't see a baby photo pretty soon, in case it meant something was wrong.) I guess I can see how your reasoning re: the photos would sound like a lack of trust to them.\n\nBut the blowing up your phones and arguing with your husband when you were exhausted from giving birth, and then ignoring your texts later when they did have the chance to see the baby all this was about? That's *wild*.", "NTA.  They can wait. It won't kill them.", "Absolutely NTA! And well done to your husband for sticking up for you. The world is crazy these days, and it's awful to think that someone out there who you don't know has a picture of your child.  It's not about the picture it's about the principal. Times were not like this when you were born and your parents need to understand that.\n Parents turn into to absolute feral creatures when they become Grandparents, they're so needy and completely ignore all your wishes you have for your child. My mum is the same. Her and MIL were terrible when we had our second child. He was born premature and spent a long time in NICU they were both so DESPERATE to see him in hospital and we said no. My mums excuse was that it was weird having a Grandchild she hadn't met yet and hadn't created a bond with. I shut her down by saying how do you think it feels for us having to leave him with strangers everyday, only getting to hold him for a couple of hours at a time, not knowing when he's coming home and having to explain to his 4 year old sister why he isn't home yet. She didn't ask again. \nPersonally I wouldn't let them see your child until they're ready to apologise, and I agree with the top comment in the fact you need to give it back to them and HARD. Don't hold back. Congratulations to you both, you're both doing amazing so far!!", "Big NTA. I know what it's like to have family members who will share photos around that you don't want shared. It's not like you were saying they would never see your son - they needed to wait, what, 2 days to FaceTime and threw a fit? Relax please. The baby isn't going anywhere.", "NTA and congrats! Our baby was born on Oct 11! \n\nI say NTA because it's 100% normal and common for parents to want a week or privacy after the baby is born. It's a big event. Both you and your husband experienced a LOT of emotions in a very small period of time. Of course you want some good quality quiet time. \n\nMy mom would certainly be annoyed if she didn't get pictures, but she wouldn't react like this either. Your parents are acting very selfishly. \n\nI hope you, your husband, and your baby are all doing wonderful, I hope everything goes perfectly for you guys, and enjoy your quality time with your newborn. :)", "NTA I\u2019m tired of people making everything about the goddamn hormones when requests and boundaries are rational. It\u2019s not the hormones, some of y\u2019all are just mean and overwhelming.", "NTA. I know lots of families who have chosen not to either send pictures or severely limit their child\u2019s online exposure. \n\nIt\u2019s your child, you can send or not send as you see fit.", "NTA. I wonder, though, if you've set such a hard boundary with everyone because you know your parents will trample the softer boundary of keeping pics of your baby private.\n\nEven if you were being completely unfair (which imo you are not), it is CRAZY that they would bring it up now and not calmly at a later time when you are healed and settled.", "Congratulations! Your only mistake was in not turning off your phone at the hospital. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your mom wants the grandma attention. Based on her past history, she would share pics with everyone she knows. \n\nYou get to decide on your boundaries. Mom's pity party is a her problem.", "NTA\n\nMy sister put some heavy boundaries in place while she was pregnant and she stood her ground.\nShe told me what she wanted and needed and I stood by her. \n\n1. She chose to not reveal the sex until after the birth.  \n2. She chose who would be invited to the hospital and when. \n3. She chose when relatives would be allowed to come visit once home and with that it was a controlled amount of time they could visit. \n4. No pictures of either of my nieces were to be distributed online. You post one without consent, consider yourself warned that she will come down hard with my BIL standing beside her. \n\nBeing a first time parent is difficult enough, then there is ***always*** one set of grandparents that toe every boundary, making it about them, forgetting to even ask the new mom if they are ok, or the new dad if he needs something.\n\nYour mom is \u201ctortured\u201d?! You just went through labour and need a moment to breathe.\n\nYour dad doesn\u2019t like the way your husband spoke to him? Tough. He was rude towards the two of you and neither of you deserve the manipulating emotional guilt trip that your parents are trying to put you through.\n\nYou are coming into some strong mama bear instincts right now and I pity the family member who chooses to wage a battle with you.\n\nTake your time with your husband and new baby.\nBreathe, find your new rhythm, and get used yo one another.\n\nTrust your gut and then, only then, send the pictures out and consider opening the door to visitors.\nStick to your boundaries and stick together. It seems you have a protective husband too, so keep him in your loop and train of thought with this.\n\nAs for the Christmas cards, my sister set up a photoshoot and sent pictures of my niece along with the new family picture.\nMy niece was born in September so a quick Canadian Thanksgiving shoot, followed by Hallowe\u2019en and then Christmas.\nEveryone got an envelope of pictures and they were adorable.\nThis also meant my sister was able to control who got what and how she wanted pictures out there.\n\nWishing you and your husband all the best with your new bundle of joy!", "Why do you keep engaging with them? At the first sign of overstepping your boundaries, you should've turned your phones off. People treat you the way you allow them to treat you. Take care of your baby and stop allowing them to stress you out.", "I guess I\u2019m going against the grain but YTA. Coming from a mom who\u2019s had to defend herself many times from the older generation being pushy for what they want, yes I think this is dramatic. (I use that word because you used it, and it applies). \n\nI can\u2019t imagine how heartbroken my family would have been if I didn\u2019t send them a picture of my baby when she was born. It\u2019s not like they were going to share it with random people. Even if they did send it to friends or relatives, why would that have been the worst thing? I think you need to look at the bigger picture. You have family who love you and care about you and this child. They don\u2019t have ill intentions towards you.", "NTA. They were pissed while you guys were still in the hospital??? You\u2019re not dramatic, they are. \n\nYou have no obligation to send photos of your child right away, let alone while you\u2019re still in the hospital. They should\u2019ve taken into consideration the life changing event that just happened to you guys.", "NTA It is normal, healthy, and appropriate to have boundaries in all your relationships. The AH is someone who can not respect someone else\u2019s boundary. An evil manipulator shames people for their boundaries.", "Guaranteed OP\u2019s mom is like my mom and would\u2019ve put the pictures on her Facebook without obtaining consent, while choosing the least flattering ones.  NTA.  I don\u2019t understand when people, including family, feel somehow entitled to things to making major life events of others about themselves.", "I couldn\u2019t even imaging starting a FIGHT with brand new parents over anything, let alone pictures!! SHUT UP!!! You will see eventually!! NTA.", "NTA. Your parents are being overbearing, entitled and rude. And worse, they're adding stress to an already stressful and exhausting time. \n\nYou are not being nonsensical. It's pretty normal to want to control the sharing of pictures of your child, especially since they can't consent to anything as a newborn. \n\nInstead of second-guessing yourself, I would encourage you to think about what you and your husband want for your child and then communicate that out to your parents and other family. Anyone who chooses not to respect your boundaries should be put on a timeout. Let them be mad, OP. Their feelings are not your responsibility and they're using them to emotionally manipulate you. Furthermore, your #1 job now is to protect your son. Your parents are no longer in your inner circle. It's you, husband and son's needs that take priority.", "NTA. You just gave birth and wanted to recover while also savor the moment. Your parents need to chill out and recognize that their behavior was wholly inappropriate.", "Nah,  you do you,  and you are definitely setting the tone of the relationship going forward ,  which is your right.    \n\nI find it odd that you can\u2019t send a picture to your parents and ask them not to share,  and I find it odd that you wouldn\u2019t want your parents to see your baby\u2026but if that\u2019s the relationship you want so be it", "NTA.  Your parents are making this all about them.  Compare their reaction to the reactions of your husband\u2019s family.  Some people don\u2019t understand a new mom still in the hospital is recovering.  What you say goes.  Stick to your boundaries now, or your parents will think they get a say in all your parenting decisions.", "With your added comment, this is a hard one. I\u2019m still going to go with NTA because not sending pictures immediately after, regardless of how rough the delivery was, is entirely up to you two. And they DID stress you out, even if you were more susceptible to it because of exhaustion and hormones. But those factors don\u2019t make your experience of their haranguing any less real. \n\nWith your dad also saying he didn\u2019t need to ever speak to or see your husband again, having them not come seems like the logical extension. But, I still feel like retracting their invitation to see the baby upon discharge was a major escalation, and I think it\u2019s going to be much harder to repair this emotionally as a result. It would have been much easier to be able to repeat, \u201cyou\u2019ll see the baby in person in x days, and you\u2019ll be the first other than us and the hospital staff,\u201d but I assume it\u2019s too late to say that now? If not, maybe that\u2019s an option?\n\nEdited to add: I think should should have your rules about sharing images and videos ironed out ahead of them getting to taken them regardless. I sense this area being an on-going challenge for you.\n\nEdited again to say that a follow-up comment that explains that you were already not able to get them to respect the first night alone with the baby flips this all the way to an easy NTA for me. I thought they were just going to be there offering support when you arrived home, but them pushing to be there earlier than you were okay with on top of the photo demands is absolutely not respecting the three of you as a new family.", "NTA even slightly.", "ESH - Sorry but boy are you overly dramatic.  One photo wouldn't have killed you., your precocious baby looks exactly like 2000000 other babies.  I know first time moms tend to be over the top but both of you created this problem.  Should they respect your decision? yea sure I guess, but I get where they are coming from. So much drama over something so stupid.", "NTA. that is your son. you deserve the right to soak up all of him on your own time, and you\u2019re right, the photo can get to people you didn\u2019t consent to seeing your son, and your son also cannot consent.", "Not at all. Your parents need to respect your and your husband's decision.", "NTA. \n\nI get it. My family sent photos of my newborn to people I didn\u2019t even know & it was stressful. Some with vulnerable images of myself in the background. \n\nPeople lose their minds when there\u2019s a new baby and don\u2019t make good decisions. If I had to do it over again I\u2019d definitely limit where photos went too. They should\u2019ve been supporting you instead of throwing g a tantrum.", "NTA, not even a little bit. \n\nPlease det some boundaries or they\u2019re gonna become helicopter grandparents. They\u2019re gonna behave as if they know best \u201cbecause they\u2019ve done this before\u201d.", "NTA\n\nYou're 100% right, she made it all about herself.  21 hours is a long labor and yet your mom felt \"tortured\".  You were exhausted and wanted to bond with your baby.  \n\nAnd your dad hangs up on his SIL and tells him they never need to speak again?  What madness.\n\nThey both owe you both an apology.  \n\nAnd it's good you're setting boundaries now because they are exactly the kind to stomp all over them.\n\nCongrats on the baby!!", "NTA. It\u2019s okay to have a boundary with this. This isn\u2019t the norm, but neither are meal trains etc to help new parents taking care of a newborn.", "I totally get it. Childbirth is awful and wonderful and exhausting and personal. They had no right to be so narcissistic and put that guilt on you. NTA. I wish I had advice on how to straighten this out, but moving forward don\u2019t forget how manipulative they were to you when you were at your most vulnerable. You now have a child who could bear the brunt of this type of behavior.", "NTA. Parents have a ridiculous level of entitlement, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA but next baby, and to anyone else who doesn\u2019t want this drama. Lie about your due date. I told people the wrong due date, and didn\u2019t let anyone know until I WAS READY. But my family loves a few hours a ways", "NTA the choice is yours on if, or if not you want to send photos of your baby to anyone. You are very smart not to send pictures of your newborn baby to your parents, because they would be sending it to everyone they know including people you have no idea who they are. If your parents want to act like assholes that is up to them, but you do not need to subject yourself, your husband or your new baby to their BS. I bet his father and grandmother did not have a hissy fit like your parents did. They acted like grown mature adults and I also bet you are more than willing to let them see the baby before your own parents. Personally I wouldn't even trust your parents around the baby unless you are with them the entire time, because they will take tons of pictures and blast them all over the internet. Now before I would even let them see the baby, they would have to offer your husband a true sincere apology for how they acted with him after the birth. They are being horrible, terrible, and entitled jackasses. Do not let them see your husband until apologize to him and you. Now most important, congratulations on the birth of your Divine Miracle sunshine xoxo", "NTA. It\u2019s your life and your baby. \n\nGrandparents are getting out of control when it comes to grand babies. \n\n90% of your parents\u2019 angst is the pressure they feel from their friends to share share share.", "NTA. When our second daughter was born my mother posted the birth announcement on Facebook with her photo before we had even told all our family and friends she was here. By the sounds of your parents they would have done the same. Make sure you lay out some boundaries with them", "NTA. We don\u2019t intend to send photos either immediately after birth. And we will only be sending photos that is not a direct facial shot of her as we don\u2019t want our baby photos all over social media of the families. We also said not to post photos online but we know some may not respect our boundaries so we are very selective what we will send. You are NTA. I find your parents especially selfish and make this experience all about them. I would give my parents a hard time and earful if they did the same to me.", "Just shut off your phone or block your parents. When they apologize they can meet the new baby.", "NTA.  Your parents are crazy people.", "NTA bc your kid your rules but it seems weird. Personally, if this was going to be your stance, no visitors and no photos I would have  told them prior. Imagine being so blessed to have grandparents that are waiting eagerly to see their grandbaby to discover no visiting or photos I can understand their frustration. Did they handle it poorly? Yea but so did you. You had the decision to send a photo and be love bombed by them or you could withhold the photos and have upset parents which in turn stressed you out. Sounds like just sending a photo would have appeased everyone involved including yourself", "Not the AH. As a parent you have every right to say no to someone taking pictures of the baby or visiting when you are just adjusting to having a newborn. With both my kids I waited for awhile before I had visitors. When I had my oldest, I had her at 4:17 am. My earliest visitor was at 10 am. Only had a handful of visitors. My earliest visitor was my bff who had been through my whole pregnancy. She was very much there when I needed her. Otherwise people had to wait. I never posted her photos until she was a year old. Only her dad and his mom posted photos. Which I was upset about but life goes on. Wait until you settle and feel comfortable to have people visit or take pictures of baby when you are ready. Other people need to learn they don\u2019t need to make it all about them when it\u2019s not their child.", "NTA. Your blinders are starting to come off in just how bad your parents are at boundaries and how little they respect your \"no\". As you look back through your life, I'm sure this will become much more clear as you see things under a new light. \n\nParents like these often say \"We don't understand\" when they actually mean \"We don't agree.\" \n\nFocus on your new family Momma. Their drama isn't worth your precious energy right now. And if you ever get the time, pick up a copy of \"Children of Emotionally Immature Parents\" - this will definitely help fill in the blanks.", "NTA. We did the same with our baby who was born in June. Even my pregnancy was kept under wraps until I was ready for my parents to share the news only with their closest friends. \n\nI was fully threatening not letting them meet the baby if they said anything before we were ready. We didn\u2019t/don\u2019t want to share our pregnancy/baby with people we talk to maybe twice a year. I have never been able to hold boundaries with my parents until I got engaged and had the support of my then fianc\u00e9e, now husband.", "your parents remind me so much of my own, I wouldn't be surprised for a second if my mum pulled this stunt on me when I'm pregnant. They drive me to the wall everyday and then guilt me anytime I don't want to talk to them. I'm getting riled up just thinking about it. ofc, you're NTA OP", "The entitlement of your parents to your child is ridiculous.  I'd seriously consider not seeing them at all for a while.  They're being insane.", "NTA- your parents are bullying you, belittling you, and disrespecting you and your husband. That crap about you just being hormonal? Puhleeez! Your parents are extra. And your dad being a jerk to your husband, and doesn\u2019t need to see or speak to him? I think not. Baby\u2019s father and baby go together. Your dad  disrespects your husband, you don\u2019t come over with the baby.  Period. They need to get over themselves.", "NTA. \n\nYour kid your choice, end of story. My husband and I don't post nor allow anyone else to post pictures of our son online.   If I thought that sending a picture to a family member would result in that photo being online, I would not send them any photo (slightly different situation from you but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). For whatever the reason, you didn't feel comfortable sending it to them. End of story. \n\nAdditionally, I almost died in labor from complications. Do you know how pissed I would have been if family made my son's birth all about them? When my son almost didn't have a mom and my husband almost became a widower? Fuck right off. You just went through something so mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausting. Letting you get acclimated to your new life should be a given, so I'm sorry you were being pressured on all sides.\n\nYou done good, mama. You and baby come first, now and always. Don't feel bad and don't let anyone else make you feel bad for this.", "NTA good for setting boundaries early, I have a feeling you\u2019ll need to do it again", "NTA and I\u2019m confident saying hat without reading anything. You just had a baby, congratulations!!! It\u2019s such a big fucking thing you did and you deserve to take whatever time you want to do anything regarding announcements, photos, visitors, ALL of it!", "Nta", "NTA I had my kid 18 years ago, and at the time you could take pictures on your phone, but they were shit quality (my baby was pixelated lmao) and you literally could do nothing with them but store them on your phone. People have survived the \"torture\" of waiting to see babies for freaking years. Shes the one being dramatic. I had to wait 3 days for the baby photos to be processed and then hope the camera did a good job (it didnt, my baby had jaundice and the photos made them look like an Oompa Loompa baby). Surely she even remembers this? \n\nMy kid has grown up hating photos of themself and wont even use their name or photo online. I have never put a photo of them anywhere without their consent and you always get those family members who you send a photo to personally and then they freaking upload it to facebook even though you never do so I stopped doing that too. You have every right to do whatever the heck your boundaries are telling you to do. I kept my kid off social media and it turned out they hate photos on social media so Im so glad i did that, because my kid ended up benefitting immensely that i did that, given their boundaries. Im an oversharer, my kid is private as heck.", "And this is exactly why I told nobody when I was in labour, I couldn\u2019t be dealing with my phone going 90.", "NTA - this reeks of entitlement and immaturity. What sounds like what happened is that you listened to your parent gut (congratulations. Your intuitions are going to serve you well!) and you knew that something simple as sending a picture was going to lead down a dark path of boundaries being pushed for now and forever. \n\nI also had a similar experience happen with my babies that resulted in permanent estrangement of my grandma. She pushed boundaries for years. When I was pregnant with my first, she called me emotional when I got upset after she told me that after the baby was born, she would come over and \u201chelp\u201d by holding the baby so I could do laundry and wash floor and I said nope (\u201cI\u2019m entitled to that baby and you can\u2019t keep me from her\u201d) After my second was born (in the middle of a pandemic), she did not agree with the ground rules I had set for a visit (including masks and not holding the baby). Her exact words were that my ground rules \u201cinsulted\u201d her and that \u201cdoesn\u2019t like me\u201d Who says something like that to a newly postpartum mom. \n\nThat was the last straw and I haven\u2019t spoken to her in almost 2 years because she is someone I cannot trust to respect the boundaries I set. \n\nI hope you find some peace and are able to enjoy your time and adjustment as a new parent.", "NTA and oh dear lord what freaking drama.  I get wanting pictures (I'm a grandmother) but labor and delivery is hell for most people - you need to focus on you and not just getting pictures out to everyone. \n\nI'm sorry your parents have poisoned such a joyous occasion for you.  You could think about new boundaries you want to set right now, while they're busy not speaking to you.", "NTA.  The **only** reason that they wanted the photo was to plaster it on the internet. They didn't care about you or the baby, they just craved that attention and dopamine burst for themselves.", "NTA- Congrats on your new baby! I would honestly put them in a 6 month time out with strict rules and strict consequences all laid out so they can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t know. Once they\u2019ve shown they can respect their well earned timeout, you and husband can decide if they can be trusted enough to have a relationship with y\u2019all and baby. \n\nAs for your dad saying he doesn\u2019t need to see your husband ever again, a rule I live by is you have to have a healthy and good relationship with me to have any sort of relationship with my children.", "YTA. We\u2019ve all been new parents and even though those first days are hard, you have to find a way to be a human. Setting limits with photos is nearly impossible so give that up.

Don\u2019t let this weird controlling behavior impact your future relationship with your family and eventually your child.", "YTA - all this drama over a picture", "ESH. Just remember that when you put someone in their place, you can't undo it!

If you're super concerned about the pictures \"circulating\" then ask your parents to not send them to anyone else and only you want to \"distribute\" images, but your parents want to be part of this incredible new chapter of your and their lives and you're being silly about sharing photos with them.

My mom\u2019s immediate reaction was \u201clet us know if you change your mind and want us to come to the hospital!\u201d Even though for weeks I said I didn\u2019t want anyone at the hospital. Then she said she was packing and said \u201cwe are coming of course! But not to the hospital.\u201d They assumed they could wait at my house. I said no.\n\nAfter 21 hours of labor and 3 hours of pushing, my son was born and we let my parents know. Immediately they were asking for photos. I understand they are excited and already love him, but holy shit I felt they were being needy and not respecting that I was tired, talking to hospital staff, trying to learn to breastfeed, etc.\n\nOnce we got moved to a recovery room, my husband  and I talked and decided to hold off on sending pictures to anyone, including to his favorite two people (his dad and grandmother) so it\u2019s not like my parents were being singled out. I can\u2019t really even explain why we don\u2019t want to send pics of our son out right now. We both just have some anxiety about sending a photo to someone and then that photo spreading like wild fire to people we did not consent to having a photo of our son sent to so we\u2019ve just decided to hold off. Not forever, but for now. We\u2019ve literally already talked about how excited we are to send our first Christmas cards this year! So this isn\u2019t a forever thing. \n\nMy parents lost their minds. Blew up both our phones, stressed me out to the point of tears so husband called my dad to ask them to stop and my dad had the balls to hang up on my husband and then my dad tells me that him and husband don\u2019t need to speak or see each other again. \n\nwhen I was discharged and sent home I sent my parents three texts about us being home and asking to FaceTime them so they could see my son via video since we weren\u2019t doing photos. They ignored me. \n\nWe finally FaceTimed yesterday and my mom told me she had been sobbing all day and it was \u201ctorture\u201d waiting for a photo. I told her she made my labor all about her and that no one asked me and husband what we wanted. It was all about what they wanted. They said they don\u2019t understand the photo thing. Everyone else in the world sends photos of new babies. I said I don\u2019t care about the world and I totally see how sending a photo seems like no big deal and our decision seems irrational but you don\u2019t have to understand it. You just have to respect it. Well that didn\u2019t go over well. \n\nSo tell me the truth, am I being dramatic? Am I the AH? My mom said I probably cried in the recovery room not because they stressed me out but because I was just hormonal and tired. \n\nBe honest with me, are my husband and I drawing a hard line over something nonsensical?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

All those involved should just be focused on the health and well being of Momma and Child.  When they have time, they can inform all those not involved that Momma and Child are healthy.

And if I'm not invited than I can wait and demonstrate what it is to be a patient friend or family member.\n\nThe only thing your parents did is justify how you held them at a distance.  They are acting like children throwing a tantrum saying \"I WANT, I WANT, I WANT!!!\".  They've only proven you right.  Your father saying he'll never speak to your husband over a photo? Really? Wow.  Only thing I've learned is your parents LOVE drama.\n\nIn the age of social media to be honest.  I can understand holding off.  I can't remember when we sent out photos.  But it wasn't immediate.  I remember we sent out a photo but I couldn't do it without photoshopping some bits, and I had no time to photoshop anything till we got home.  I also remember being exhausted when we got home.  So I think it might have been a week or so.\n\nI don't blame you in the least and as you talked about their behavior it becomes VERY clear why they weren't invited to the hospital or home.

I am so impressed that your husband dealt with this directly in order to protect you!  He gets an A+!  \n\nYour parents sound like they get their way or they make you suffer until they get their way kind of people!!  \n\nYour father needs to apologize to your husband for what he said!  It was inappropriate. My preference is no baby visits until he apologizes. \n\nI\u2019m probably old enough to be your mother and hearing this I can\u2019t imagine having constant texts and calls while in labor, delivery and right after. This is time you should be able to be in the moment. Just because we have cell phones doesn\u2019t mean you should be disrupted. \n\nMy advice is for both of you to put your phones away for blocks of time during the day. Tell your parents your going to check your phone only a couple times a day and not to worry that you want this time with your husband and baby to be private and peaceful. When you\u2019re ready you will call them. \n\nIf they show up you are not obligated to answer the door. \n\nYour parents haven\u2019t been putting you and your needs first.

It might help you. \n\nThe best way to deal with it is to set boundaries by telling them what behaviors you aren\u2019t willing to put up with and what you will do the next time they overstep.

Guess who wasn\u2019t around for weeks after our second baby was born? You guessed it! My family was notified after 3 days that our son was born, and told that we needed a bit of time to recover before visitors. I think we sent photos over at that time too. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy to me how many people become sooo entitled the second someone has a baby.

Sounds like they aren\u2019t great with boundaries based on the other things I\u2019ve seen you write in the comments and I just think a lot of this is unnecessary and wish you had a different birthing experience.

Sharing a picture was pulling out the photo album and showing the bath time baby pics. It was embarrassing, But at least the photo stayed in the album. No one could leave with that picture. School bullies couldn't search it up, Future employers couldn't find that picture while \"researching\" them.  \n\n\nYou as a parent have to be careful how you present your child.

I told all family and friends there would be an announcement of birth, but there would be absolutely no photos anywhere for anyone until my husband had the chance to meet his daughter and enjoy that moment. We video called once or twice during the stay and they got to see her that way, but they were all really respectful about not asking for anything until we made it home and were ready.

It sucks when people in your life make what is already difficult (birth, becoming a new parent) about them and their selfish feelings. This should have been a time filled with joy and love, and sure family is going to want news and photos, but they should have been excitedly waiting for them, not demanding and needy.", "Yikes! I had to have an emergency c-section and afterwards my throat was so irritated I could not speak. My parents came to my room but I signaled I didn\u2019t want company. Urgh it was awful and I felt awful for not wanting to see them but goodness the emergency c-section was horrible", "NTA. I was also incredibly protective of my newborn that first week and felt very iffy about sending pictures to anyone. I didn\u2019t want them to circulate via text or end up on social media- both of which happened. People get so weird about babies. You did nothing wrong. Your baby, your rules.", "NTA\nI think we have the same Mom. I had a bambino a few months ago. Specifically told our parents we did not want anyone at the hospital. My mother told my MIL that as soon as she hears we\u2019re en route, she\u2019s going to drive to the hospital just to be there, \u201cin case I need her\u201d\u2026 which is weird bc our relationship is not solid, she\u2019s been a narcissistic emotionally immature parent my entire life. So, knowing that,  I called her after my emergency c-section. And thank God I did, there is no way I would\u2019ve been able to handle her and my birth trauma at the same time.\n\nAs far as photos go, my husband and I agreed we are not sharing any photos of our kid online- and neither is anyone else. My in laws have a problem with this and have asked multiple times if they can post on FB.\n\nIdk what is with our GenX parents and their personal issues with respecting our decisions. You have to set the guilt aside and remember that your number 1 focus right now and always is your little peanut. Don\u2019t worry about others feelings. Our parents already did their parenting- we\u2019re adults now and they need to learn to respect our decisions.", "Huge congrats Mama! So NTA. There are horror stories of baby pics sent out and on social media against the parents wishes. You are doing great already, protecting that precious baby. Keep those hard boundaries. Enjoy your husband and new baby \ud83e\udd70", "Whew. People just don\u2019t respect boundaries anymore. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your parents are emotionally immature. Their reactions are ridiculous and selfish. \n\nCongratulations! Best wishes to you and your husband.", "Definitely NTA. At the one moment you needed support, even if that support was giving you and your husband space to start your family together, your parents decided to add stress and drama instead of support. Your life, your baby, your decision.", "Geez! NTA! \n\nI admit, I don't have the same misgivings about sharing photos of my child, but I have friends who are this way, and I don't get all bent out of shape about it. If anyone is being dramatic, it's your parents.", "NTA\n\nYour family, your rules. \n\nThat said. I keep seeing more and more posts about people expecting their parents to go days and even weeks without seeing a new baby, including grandparents and I find it kind of bizarre. Not trying to gotcha but would you feel the same way when your child has children? You'd be ok not even seeing the child or being trusted with a photo for an undisclosed period of time? Just seems to be a new trend I don't really get although I certainly feel like it's not necessarily wrong.", "Not an asshole\u2026i guess.. since everyone has the right to send/not send photos of their own kid but it makes sense that they would be deeply hurt by your decision to explicitly NOT send photos to anyone. It\u2019s just a bit over the top and paranoid. I cant imagine not wanting to send photos immediately (once settled down) especially with the people that have been the most supportive and are anxiously awaiting to congratulate you and share in your joy. Now, if you have a genuinely sinister family that would use those photos in a way you dont like, then sure\u2026but if things were to that point i wouldnt have those people in my life to begin with.", "NTA \nYou are not obligated and you don\u2019t owe others pictures of your newborn", "I totally understand your perspective but the 3 hour wait for photos of my niece really did feel like torture! I can understand that they would feel like you don\u2019t trust them or something but I also understand your perspective, it just should have been communicated beforehand to set expectations", "No. Your baby, your rules. \n\nSet the boundaries now, because it won\u2019t get any better.", "NTA, Your child, your choice!", "My answer is going to be different. \nI think YTA... and you\u2019re being extremely dramatic. \nI recognize you\u2019ve been through quite the experience, giving birth. But this child will be surrounded by love and FAMILY. You\u2019re a new mom, yes. Congrats. But they\u2019re also grandparents now. I think you\u2019re being selfish and inconsiderate, because there are people who care about you and this child also. The isolationist attitude is already straining relationships with essential family members. \n\nPeople on Reddit are going to say your mom is crazy and to cut her out of your life. But that\u2019s unreasonable. Just share. They love you and that child too.", "NTA. Your child. Your rules. Silly or not. For the rest of your life you will be protecting this little being. Always, always, go with your gut. You did good!", "NTA, keep the boundaries. Sounds like they are needed!", "You should have sent a pic of the baby with text written all over it. Big, bold text so the baby is hardly noticeable. \"I am still recovering from labor, learning how to breastfeed, and how to care for my new child. Your constant hounding is stressful for me. STOP.\"", "NTA. If you gave in and sent them those photos the exact thing you feared would happen would have happened \u2013 judging by their sheer lack of boundaries, those pics would have been plastered all over Facebook by the end of the day.", "That\u2019s why my husband called my dad, but then my dad hung up on him because \u201cI won\u2019t be talked to this way.\u201d", "100% agree! If it were me, I\u2019d go as far as not letting them even FaceTime / visit. No new parent deserves to be treated that way. So sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. Congratulations on your little one\ud83e\udd0d", "You set a clear boundary and didn't waiver an inch. You are going to do this Mama thing just fine. Kudos to hubs for being right beside you.", "And, assuming a supportive relationship between mother and daughter, the daughter shouldn\u2019t withhold all pictures and access to baby *without sufficient explanation*. \n\nOP\u2019s mother\u2019s generation has never heard of anyone doing this. To OP\u2019s mother, it signals a complete breakdown of their relationship. She\u2019s brokenhearted because OP took drastic action without explanation. At least some of the responsibility is OP\u2019s.", "heavy emphasis on \"you're the mum so what you say goes.\" i'd make sure to pound that point the fuck home, because otherwise expect your kids to come home from grandmas behaving completely differently because \"grandma said i should act this way instead.\"", "Pretty much this. Ignoring the FaceTime call really cements it - having a tantrum over not getting a shareable photo trumps actually seeing her grandson, which is sad. 100% NTA, OP.", "THIS. My parents were all in for the currency of cute grandkid photos/visits (and kid accomplishments, TBH) and absolutely NOT there for the care/support/play. Mine came to my house when our baby was 6 weeks old and never lifted a finger to prep a meal or change a diaper. They bought the baby a cute outfit and took photos.", "Okay. But that\u2019s pretty standard. People like babies. People like seeing pictures of babies. On its face, a request to have a photo of your new grandchild and show it off proudly is severely normal. We\u2019re living in a society here. \n\nI get the response if OP\u2019s parents have been meddling nightmares in the past, but it\u2019s definitely an unusual boundary to set. As OP said, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re celebrities and have to gatekeep pics of their kid at this age. Later in life the conversation around sharing pics of kids online definitely becomes more complicated, but a newborn\u2026? There\u2019s definitely some weird anxiety going on here.", "My mom showed everyone in my family the pictures of my baby when she was born. Like people I haven\u2019t talked to in a decade. People I haven\u2019t talked to at all in my life", "This. Begin as you mean to go on. It sucks to have to fight this battle now, when you have so much else on your plate, but it is better to set their expectations *now*, than to have to reel them in later.", "There are some people in both our families (my mother, husband\u2019s grandmother) that even if we said \u201chere\u2019s a photo!

They\u2019ve known you your entire life and wanna see the baby!\u201d And husband\u2019s grandmother would have sent it to every 2nd and 3rd cousin who\u2019s number she has. So, we decided to hold off. I know we can\u2019t hide this kid forever, and damn it\u2019s not like we are some celebrity couple trying to keep our kid out of magazines - but he\u2019s not even a week old. Let us keep him to ourselves for just a bit.", "It sounds like you grew up in a supportive family that respects your boundaries. Unfortunately, many of us experience exactly the opposite of that. Some family members (like OP's parents) are toxic. self-serving AHs who only think of their own needs and have less than a passing concern for their children. Sadly, I grew up with parents very similar to OP's. I would bet my entire retirement fund that none of these family members would respect OP's wishes. Any photos of her newborn would be shared to anyone and everyone, and most likely posted to her parent's (probably) fully public FB page.\n\nIt may seem odd to you, but to someone who has spent a lifetime with family members who tread all over boundaries, not providing pictures is a protective mechanism.", "I know, and to be honest I don\u2019t understand people\u2019s obsession to see a baby the second it pops out the vagina. Like just *wait* a week or two holy shit", "Umm because that\u2019s their child\u2019s child. Watching your lineage grow is a special moment. Why prevent others from celebrating and enjoying this joyous occasion WITH them?", "No, everybody doesn't share pictures. It's just that everyone does in *her* circle of friends.", "I was BOGGLING at the \"torture\" comment about not getting a picture right away because I'm five days out from a night that my mom will be the FIRST to say was clearly way worse for me than her. But the wait for the next message after \"they're prepping for surgery now\" probably WAS torture especially when it was an hour and a half after the baby was born before I had my wits about me to tell my husband the passcode for my phone to let her know we were now both okay.\n\nBut just not getting a photo after confirmation of successful birth? Torture?", "Honestly, the more I sit here and think about it - it\u2019s less about sending a photo and more about me and my husband making our first parenting decision and it IMMEDIATELY getting pushed back against. Instead of \u201cthese two are new parents and I\u2019m going to respect their journey of how they decide to raise their son\u201d it\u2019s, \u201cbut it only matters what I want!!\u201d", "I understand given that her dad wants to end his relationship with her whole family just for waiting a day for photos.

After ignoring my three texts the day of my discharge, I got them to FaceTime the next day and they saw him. We didn\u2019t want to send a tangible photo (to anyone) because there are definitely people in our families who, even if we say \u201cdon\u2019t send this around,\u201d they still would - and my mom is one of them. If I sent my mom a photo and said \u201cplease don\u2019t share\u201d then the argument would have been \u201cwhy can\u2019t I send this to Anna, Becky, and Susan from work?!\u201d", "Who are you to judge them for not sending a photo? They explained why they didn't want to.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking too", "\u201cSetting the tone\u201d is exactly the way to put this.

Having a baby is physically and emotionally hard and once the baby has been born, things change. I had a bunch of ground rules and still made huge adjustments after my babies were born because shit happens and those who truly supported me understood rather than trying to gaslight me because they seemed entitled to something that wasn\u2019t theirs.", "They will not follow any rules about not circulating pictures. Not after a reaction that large.", "Dude I agree. I'm also a new mom but I prioritized sending pictures to everyone. We weren't teh only ones excited about my son.", "I would be so hurt if my daughters treated me this way.

Another village scorched.", "Don\u2019t forget burning the village down on day one.  Oof.", "Agreed. \n\nOne of my ongoing thoughts reading this is one day this baby will have his own child and she will be where her parents are right now.", "I felt that until they refused to FaceTime. This isn\u2019t about seeing their grandchild. This is about having a photo to show off to friends. That\u2019s not as important as how the new mom feels. Their attitude is kind of horrible.", "Then why didn't they agree to the FaceTime with the baby?  All they wanted was a photo, for bragging rights.  They had no interest in actually meeting the kid.", "They were offered facetime to see the baby. All they were interested in was a photo to boast with on social media.

You're the AH here", "And men also used to not be allowed to be in the delivery room. And not all that long ago in the States, women were put into a \u201ctwilight sleep\u201d so they were unconscious while giving birth. But, times have changed.

We take the good to carry into the future  and leave the bad and the problematic in the past where it belongs.", "They're not proud of her, they chastised her for making a decision about HER child. I couldn't imagine having a go at my daughter for something like this. I wouldn't expect her to want me there when she goes into labour either, I wouldn't be angry, hurt or mad by the decisions she makes about her OWN child. Decisions must be respected and that goes for parents as well. Respect is earned not given. Family can be the worst people at times.", "The thing is, the plan was for them to come up to my house when we were discharged and stay for about 5 days.

Not feeling like they have some kind of entitlement to a baby and be able to steamroll their way into the bonding process.", "It\u2019s not like it was a few years ago, though. Before to see pictures of someone\u2019s baby you\u2019d have to look at a physical photo, now that picture can be shared around the globe, being looked at by who knows who. In this day and age it\u2019s very important to control your child\u2019s image", "Did you think maybe they want to settle in and make announcements first. Instead of others sharing the picture. Like come on her mom was sobbing about a picture. That is an overreaction. This coming from someone who cries. Her mom made it all about her feelings instead of ops. Her mom could have brought it up at a later date.", ">can you imagine how it must feel for them? To be excluded to this extent? \n\nFirst, giving birth isn't a spectator sport.  They had no right to be \"included\" or anywhere near that baby and had no right to demand pictures while the mother & baby are still in the freaking hospital.  Parents have a right to control pictures of their children. Nobody has a right to demand them.\n\nAnd they weren't excluded.  The parents offered to FaceTime with the baby, and her parents refused.  This tells me they only wanted pictures to send to everybody in their contact list -- bragging rights.  They had no interest in actually *meeting* the baby.

I don't understand gatekeeping photos from OP's village just because... I mean OP and her husband were not too tired to provide updates so naturally the grandparents and close family are requesting a photo now that she and baby are safe.  OP's husband could have easily snapped a photo and shared with family with instructions not to post online. \n\nI don't get the decision to withhold a photo.  Unless this baby has distinguishing features, no one is going to know who's child this *if* the photo somehow makes the internet rounds. \n\nThe whole thing is absurdly silly and so overwrought.

It sounds like OP told her family ahead of time that they couldn't be at the hospital or be at their house when they were discharged, but expected at least a photo of baby while they waited for an in-person meeting.  \n\nI think it's a tad unfair not to share even a photo, especially since they're providing updates via text.", "Oh I\u2019m definitely not blaming her for my long labor! It was more of a point that I was exhausted and recovering but that didn\u2019t seem to be taken into account. Husband texted my parents when we checked into the hospital and when my son was officially born (as well as other updates throughout the night/day) so they knew how long everything took but they didn\u2019t care.

When they apologize for their behavior sincerely, they get a photo.

They have to earn their grandchild with love, compassion and respect. \n\nIf you're not firm in your resolve, they will make your life hell.", "I would tell ur parents the same, they don't get to talk to u or ur husband this way.

Subconsciously she knew they had ulterior motives that weren\u2019t about the baby.", "It's *not* standard in all circles. In fact, in the facebook age, it makes a lot of new parents uncomfortable.

Susan from work and Kathy next door can wait. You are looking at your baby with your own eyes right now - along with RECOVERING FROM LABOUR AND DELIVERY - and you don\u2019t owe anyone photos from the first hours of your baby\u2019s life.", "Or worse, it would definitely wind up on social media with endless congrats from distant acquaintances.\n\nI thought the FaceTime idea was great and addresses that concern. It sounds more like your mom wanted to be the first to show everyone.", "We knew family would do stuff like that and have a very strict no posting names and posting pictures policy (unless we approve the picture).  There was some push back at first but over two years in they understand that I will freely send pictures privately but if they don't follow our rules they don't get sent pictures or visits.   \n\nThey wanted to know initially why they couldn't share pictures with their friends and my response is that they can.   They can show their friends the pictures and videos on their phone to their hears desire, just like the olden days when they would show off all the wallet pictures of their grandkids.  But no mass spreading it on social media to get internet props to all their friends and random acquaintances because all their profiles are public.", "But like\u2026 why do you care who the photo gets sent to? They want to share their joy too. You don\u2019t get to be the only one excited about your baby, and expecting to control what everyone does has to be exhausting.

It makes me feel uncomfortable and exposed knowing they sent off my photos or posted them when I only thought a handful of people would see. Honestly it\u2019s the crossing the boundary that makes me more angry than random people seeing the pictures. It\u2019s blatant disrespect.", "I am the same way. Hardly anyone gets photos of my baby because boomers don't understand digital privacy. The baby's picture will be saved to Susan's phone/icloud/Google photos forever and Kathy will forward it to her kids because they \"know\" you. That is a hill I will die on.", "Amen to both of these. I have a 3 week old and It trips me out how weird people are about babies.", "Nailed it.  Not only that, you deprived them of the ability to send your son's photo to all their friends.  \"Look at the grandson we produced!\"  Seriously.\n\nNTA.  Congrats on the baby!", "They challenged your parenting in a very self-absorbed, entitled way.

My kids are older now, but my parents were essentially the same as yours. \n\nAs you child grows up, I imagine it's going to open your eyes to a lot of toxic parenting on their part. It surely did for me.\n\nI know I'm a stranger, but as a mom and a child of narcissistic parents...if they continue to act in this way, it's 100% okay to not have a relationship with them. Your physical and mental health, and the health of your partner and your children, comes first. If they want to act like petulant children then they can pound sand.", "Oof it sounds like your parents need to be on an info diet. If you choose to have another, then they hear about the baby once the baby is born, not when you go into the hospital. Your mom ruined it for herself by not respecting your wishes and that means she doesn't get pictures until you are ready for everyone to see them.", "And \"why can't I post it on Facebook?\" -- so Zuck can monetize it, like he monetizes everybody's photos.\n\nNTA.  I'm glad they finally grew up and agreed to meet him via FaceTime.  They're more babies than that newborn you have.", "If they treat you bad like that again, you should consider not rewarding them. Facetime after they put you on time out is unfair to you. They want to be pissy, let them. If they miss moments with the baby, that's on them. Your child has two loving parents, that's more important than toxic grandparents", "I full understand this. My mom has full on announced deaths on Facebook before their immediate family had all been contacted. She can\u2019t be trusted with anything, because she will use anything and anyone to get online validation from others. \n\nI am now fully no contact with her, for that and a wide variety of other reasons.", "Can you take a screenshot while FaceTiming? That was the first thing that popped into my head.", "The entire purpose of this sub is to give judgement.  Don\u2019t post on aita if you don\u2019t want to be judged", "She specifically asked if it we thought they were drawing a hard line over something nonsensical, though", "No it isn\u2019t. From my personal experience, older family members who demand baby photos and share them to any stranger in the supermarket will also do this as kids get older and will give out personal information like where you\u2019re child goes to school. \n\nWhen I post a photo of my kids (which is very limited), I have to use an app to cover up the school name/logo or any other identifiable info about their school because my dingbat relatives with no sense of internet safety think it\u2019s ok for random strangers to know where my kids go to school, what grade they are in, etc.", "Think AITA only counts the judgment of the first (and second?) comment", "Well people are different for sure! I\u2019ve never had to ask. My kids called both sets of grandparents every time they went into labor & said we needed to get to hospital if we want to be there. We waited in room till mama got back from labor, & once pics were taken with new mom & dad, dad took pics of each grandparent holding our newborn grandchild. We went through that process 4 times, & the 5th time it was twins. \nSo I guess I\u2019m just blessed!", "Bc they were offended!", "What\u2019s wrong with bragging about a new grandchild? I guarantee a best friend probably got a pic.", "Definitely not in this case. But then it shouldn\u2019t have to override parents wishes.", "C'mon.  They were providing updates.  It would have been so much more effort to send one photo?  It doesn't have to be staged.  It seems like the parents were excited to at least see baby.  Sharing baby photos with close family is fairly customary and OP did not tell the parents in advance that they wouldn't be sharing any photos of baby until Xmas", "I'm not sure exactly what's going on here but...the plan was for them to come to your house at discharge and help for several days and when they said they were packing after the birth you said they couldn't come and now don't even want to send a picture until Christmas card time? Is that right? It's your right to do whatever you want right after a birth but it seems like you massively changed plans on them and they're understandably upset. To go from \"you can meet us at home and hold Baby as soon as we're out of the hospital\" to \" you will get a Christmas card in 2 months\" is just a very huge and abrupt change.", "At first I thought you was feeling overwhelmed, which I understand and can relate to, but your comment here completely changes my opinion. \n\nNTA. Your parents being excited about their new grandchild is absolutely understandable, and I also think our kids are not our property and unless proven harmful, your parents also have the right to meet and connect with the baby. \n\nBut that's very different from just wanting a photo to post as a  trophy to family and friends, and I feel that might be the case here. You JUST became three. You are entitled to some privacy and get to know each other before announcing to the world the baby is here, if that's what you want to do.", "Newborn's image? cmon now. \n\nAnd we are talking about sending it to its grandparents. Presumably they can be instructed/ threatened to not post it on social media if needed. \n\nBut really to prohibit them from even seeing it... and like ... let's also be real: newborns are beautiful bc they are new life but they are not beautiful aesthetically yet! hahahaha", "Announcement.... to grandparents? \n\nOf course not in the first minutes but... probably the first day?\n\nI dunno I just don't know of ANY grandparents who would be like, sure anytime in the next 5 days to 3 months... \n\nI did say they overreacted but I'm not sure if that was day 1 or day 5. I do think day 5 is excessive.", "lol they care, very much, it\u2019s just really not hard to take a couple pics. pick your battles.", "Yes? OP's husband's job is to shield her from both his parents and her own.", "Did your sister tell your parents not to share, or did she assume?\n\nI wouldn't make any assumptions about what grandparents consider normal - I'd tell them explicitly what I expect (whether that's to do with sharing photos, or whatever else to do with the kids). If she asked your parents not to send the photos on to anyone else, and they still sent them to a group chat to all their friends, then your parents are untrustworthy liars. \n\nThere really is no other description for a person who says \"I will not do X\", and then does X.\n\nIf she just assumed that they would have the same attitude to photo privacy that she does, then - well, we all know about assuming...", "Don't listen OP. That person is unhinged and projecting. You take care of you and your baby. They treated you with no respect. NTA", "This is not isolated. I said this example earlier but when my husband and I were engaged, my mom was helping me plan the wedding. When deciding the menu she wanted to add shrimp and I said no. She was not pleased. My husband is allergic to shrimp \u2026 and not \u201coh I got a rash,\u201d type of allergy; it\u2019s the \u201coh my throat is closing up\u201d type of allergic. But SHE wanted shrimp and was pissy when I said no.", "Thank you! We plan to set a similar boundary when our baby is born in about a month. I plan to send out a photo when we are ready and to keep the baby's photos off of social media. My husband and I don't feel that we (as his parents) have the right to share our child's image all over creation without his consent. \n\nPlus, those new baby photos often come tagged with a lot of information. The baby's first, middle, and last name. Birthdate and time, weight and length, and maybe where they were born. It just doesn't feel right to me. I'll share photos individually with people I trust.", "Yes. And this isn\u2019t the first time my mom has made something all about her. When she was helping me plan my wedding, she wanted to include shrimp on the menu and was upset when I said no. My husband is allergic to shrimp \u2026..", "Why shouldn\u2019t they care who gets a photo of THEIR child?? It\u2019s their child! If they don\u2019t want people to have photos, tough shit!! Their child, their rules!\n\nETA: NTA", "I wish I could downvote this so many more times than once. NTA OP. You set a boundary and your parents lost their shit. It sounds like you and your partner are in agreement and it's perfectly reasonable. Keep setting (and enforcing) those boundaries! Sounds like you're gonna need them with your parents.", "No one has the right to be this possessive over someone else\u2019s child lmao", "You can. You can also take normal and Live Photos using a button but that alerts the person on the other end temporarily. I really hope the grandparents are extremely un-tech savvy.", "Oh right!", "My mama has been right there for all three of mine. She works third, so after I was home, she'd stop by early in the morning on her way home just to hold the baby. For months. With all three. I have a wonderful mother.", "You really are.  These modern-day pregnancies are something else entirely.", "Yeah\u2026there\u2019s definitely some baggage in this relationship, no doubt caused by boundaries not being respected in the past. You reap what you sow.", "Yeah, I think they were in their feelings.  It probably hurt to be rejected from receiving a photo for no real reason other than they don't want photos of their son to make it onto the internet.  If anything, now is the best time since newborns are pretty indistinguishable.", "I\u2019m sorry, I haven\u2019t explained myself well. \n\nI told them not to head over because they live three hours away and my mom and dad were planning on starting the drive the second I texted them that we had gotten to the hospital. We had no idea how long labor was going to take, how long we\u2019d be in the hospital afterwards, when we\u2019d be discharged, etc. \n\nSo, the plan was the once I was discharged, husband I would go home and let my parents know we were home. We\u2019d spend the first night just as our family, and then my parents would come the next morning and stay for about five-ish days, maybe more if my recovery was really bad and I needed help - especially because my husband had to immediately go back to work. \n\nBut they tried to come up immediately and basically hang out in our house while we were in the hospital. I\u2019m sure lots of people would have been fine with that but we wanted to be able to come home to our house, just our new family, and then parents come up the next day. \n\nWhen all this went down and my dad said he didn\u2019t need to see or speak to my husband anymore, that\u2019s when the invitation was retracted.", "Not what it looks like. It looks like OP parents was going to be the first ones to meet the baby in person and spend 5 days with them. But after throwing a tantrum and threatening to go nc because of a photo, the invitation was removed.", "OP said that her mother wasn't to be trusted to keep the photo private.  \n\nAnd at the end of the day:  nobody has a right to the picture of a minor, unless they're the kid's parents.  Especially a digital picture.  You put that baby's image on Facebook, and Zuck has it.  If it's cute enough, he'll monetize it.", "Op did comment that her mom wouldn\u2019t have kept the picture to herself. That she would have immediately sent it to others. Op mom is a boundary stomper. Unfortunately when you are you loose out on things like receiving pictures of your newborn grandchild.", "If they cared, they would respect the decision to hold off on taking pics. OP also offered something that was better, frankly, in the terms of a Facetime video, and yet they were still upset. It's one thing to be disappointed about not immediately seeing your grandchild-it's completely another to bother your daughter when she is recovering from childbirth and comparing not getting a photo to \"torture.\" If anyone truly cannot wait for a photo or video until their child has been discharged and think it's appropriate to harass their hospitized daughter, they have issues that need to be addressed in therapy.", "Yes - and he\u2019s done just that! That\u2019s why he was the one who called my dad and got hung up on.", "So is your mother the narcissist and dad the enabler or are they both equally selfish? NTA", "You are doing good, but I think your mom is not used to you having boundaries and saying no. She will just have to get used to it, and if your parents' behavior continues to be immature, controlling and toxic, you may have to go low contact with them for a while. \n\nSometimes new grandmas or even both grandparents start feeling like they are \"ENTITLED\" to ownership of their grandbaby, which is ridiculous, of course, but they still feel it. Let them know this child is YOURS, not THEIRS and if they need an infant that badly, maybe they should think about fostering...  And nobody ever \"OWNS\" a baby, they are a human, you will need to care for, to teach the ways of life to, and eventually slowly let go of...  \n\nUnfortunately, sometimes refusing their physical presence for a while is necessary to let them know you did NOT have a baby for them! And yes, sometimes, a \"time out\" IS the proper thing to do, even with full ass grown adults! Congratulations! Enjoy that little bundle of warm, milky, sleepy joy, and good luck with your parents, they'll hopefully see things in a new light very soon!", "Stand your ground. You not wanting to send pictures is NOT a weird thing. Sorry, in this day and age pics spread like wild fires.  Your parents are unreasonable. Congratulations.  Enjoy your baby. They can enjoy the Christmas card.", "Do you think they just have really thin skin so everything feels like a rejection? Or is it more like they just want to have their way for its own sake?", "Honestly, they sound like my parents. Big events like being pregnant, having a baby, etc were always overshadowed because they made up some kind of drama every single time.\nMy mother was the narcissist and my father the enabler.. Stand your ground because if you give an inch they will take the whole nine yards.", "Wow!!! \nSet serious boundaries and stick to it.", "Read \"Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents\" by Lindsay Gibson. It is a good book and sounds like what you are dealing with at the moment and in the past with your parents.", "If this is not an isolated incident then you need to tell your parents they will NEVER see their grandchild if they don't stop their bullshit. Complete NC will follow soon after.", "Back in the day when grandma and grandpa had a couple of prints each in their wallets, nobody cared who they pulled them out and showed them off to, because the fact that it was a physical print limited circulation. But in the digital age, there's no limit, and that makes people nervous.\n\nMy mother tells a story of two academics in one history department, in a situation where one was having an affair with the other's wife. The first realized when they showed off their baby photos, and he realized it was the same picture.", "Uh\u2026 yeah honey time to lay out some big boundaries with them. Make sure you state clearly \u201cI feel ___ when ___ action happens (refrain from saying \u201cI feel ___ when you ___\u201d it\u2019ll just come off as an attack) therefore, my boundary is that if anyone does ___ I will respond with __ action\u201d example: \u201cI feel disrespected when photos of my child are shared without my husband and I\u2019s permission. Our boundary is that if a photo is shared even once without our explicit permission, we will no longer send you photos.\u201d", "This is what I knew I would eventually see. And I'm sure you have 100s more examples of how self-centered your mother is and how much your father enables it. NTA", "If send them pics of random newborns.", "In that case, it sounds like them deciding to distance themselves is not the worst thing in the world.\n\nI'd call their bluff- if they want to be manipulative by giving you the silent treatment, it's fine to just say \"Okay\" and drop your end of the rope.", "YTA for not going NC sooner. Why you do this to yourself?", "Please stay strong and don't give away your perfectly understandable boundaries.  This is you and your husband's child and your first and once in a lifetime moment.  Don't feel guilty and don't back down. Your mother has proven time and again with your father's backing that they cannot be trusted to honor your wishes. You should be enjoying your baby's arrival, resting and recovering, and getting to know your little one. You should not be stressing about someone else's narcissistic attempt to take over the birth of your child. So very NTA.\n\nFor your sanity and your peace of mind please be severe and go very low contact or no contact until you see fit.   Congratulations on your little one and I hope you enjoy all the rest of the moments to the fullest.", "OP, I understand completely.  You\u2019re NTA.  You\u2019ve been through a lot - birth is a time to focus on you and your baby.  Your parents were being selfish - they can be excited and still be patient like we were all (hopefully) taught as little kids.  The world doesn\u2019t revolve around your parents, although it sounds like they think it should.  Hold your boundaries and know that it\u2019s ok.", "I guarantee they took pictures and they just aren\u2019t sending them. This isn\u2019t about putting the phone down and enjoying the moment. It\u2019s about setting a really silly boundary for no reason.", "OP might want to visit the sub raisedbynarcissists (I'm new to tagging subs, but you can search it OP) this is some truly unhealthy and unhelpful behavior coming from your Mom and Dad. That sub has honestly helped me identify and validate things, I had dealt with for years...but didn't recognize fully. OP them not only not respecting your boundaries is a huge red flag, yet further to blatantly bombard and punish you for setting those boundaries....is toxic and entirely unnecessary. For over 24 hours (labor maybe have been 21 and pushing 3 but it may have felt like much longer) you were bringing a human into the world, they should've hushed and sent positive vibes until they heard back from you and/or hubby. That's it, that's as simple as it should've been. Sending you love, I'm so sorry you had to endure this BS.", "Especially after they pushed after she said no to them coming to the hospital and invading her home!

They drove their daughter to tears when she was giving birth because she wouldn\u2019t do things their way. They deserve to be in time out and they can stamp their little feet about it. Their actions got them to this point, not their feelings.", "That\u2019s the thing, I wish I could share all the examples of the disrespect my parents have shown, particularly to my husband who has done nothing but be my biggest supporter and advocate.

Alas, it is not possible.", "I immediately thought maybe they should have sent a random Google images picture of a newborn and let the grandparents run with it \ud83d\ude02", "OMIGOD YES!!  Yes!!!  I will send you pics of long-grown newborns in my family if you need them in hospital blankets, op.

However, the way they treated her and her husband isn't ok. When OP was born social media was probably just people they knew, so her parents don't see a problem. But, again, to demand it and then when they upset a hormonal (why is that an excuse to dismiss feelings? It makes them worse so we should be extra careful of them!) new mom, dismiss her tears and say Gma was sobbing all day? No. Breastfeeding is hard enough to learn, you can't do well if you're sad enough to cry. Newborns can kinda sense that and if you have one that isn't a natural eater they can refuse to eat well. OP is NTA, even if I think they ARE a little weird about the pictures, it's not enough to be called an AH. I'm sorry she had to put up with it too.", "Well, that's why your parents are so disrespectful to your husband, he supports you, he especially supports you having boundaries with them. They have to hate that", "I\u2019m guessing your parents were able to steamroll you a lot more before your husband came into the picture and started advocating for you.", "That'd be impossible even if she could post here. The problem is that too many of us have parents just like your mom. We would see through every word she typed. That's why no one is surprised that she's always been this way. People like us can practically SMELL each other. I would advise you to check out r/raisedbynarcissists . I suspect you'll fit right in.", "Seems like your parents don't respect you as the adult and now parent that you are. They are treating you as if you are a child and there will be consequences if you don't do exactly what they want. You need to learn to not care about \"their hurt feelings\", when they clearly don't care about yours or your spouses. They aren't treating you as if you have any autonomy. There's some good new parent resources on JustNoMil and MildlyNoMil in their wiki's. You are going to have to shine up your spine, with your spouses help, when it comes to establishing boundaries.
