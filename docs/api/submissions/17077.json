I told him it was okay if he wanted to keep things casual and think about this when the time came, but he insisted he wanted to move with me.\n\nCurrently, I live by myself and my boyfriend lives with roommates. Earlier this year, we tried him living at my place for 3 months and things went okay. He did not help with rent, utilities or groceries during these three months, which would have been nice, but not necessary. He told me he thought living together was fine and that he would not be renewing his lease this summer.\n\nHe called me yesterday and told me he is going to be renewing his lease because his roommates are not in a good spot financially. I told him this shattered all the trust I had with him, because he\u2019s choosing his roommates over me. All I wanted was for him to be honest with me. We got into an argument and he essentially called me heartless for telling him going back on his commitment to me is wrong.\n\nHe told me that when the time came to move out of state, he would 100% do that, but for now, he\u2019ll stay with his roommates until they\u2019re financially stable. I told him that I cannot trust him anymore, because he can\u2019t even commit to a move within the same city, so how can I trust him to move out of the state?\n\nI\u2019m so upset and I feel really stupid. It really hurts to know I\u2019m not a priority in his life and I will be secondary to his roommates.\n\nTL;DR: Am I the asshole for being mad that my boyfriend is backing out of his commitment to moving in with me to help his roommates?", "created_utc": 1683905450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13foc6h/aita_for_not_caring_about_boyfriends_roommates/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's not all into the relationship from the sound of it. You just dodged a bullet from a guy who couldn't even be bothered to help you for the 3 months he did stay with you.  Live your best life and move on.", "NTA - He's had plenty of time to figure this out and so have his roommates. It's not like he's the only person who can live with them. He's either lying to you or to himself, but either way it's impossible to read this as anything other than him not wanting to move in.", "Let me get this straight. You're mad that your boyfriend, who lived with you for 3 months without contributing to rent or bills, isn't going to move in with you(in state) where he could continue to not contribute? And, if you move out of state and he doesn't have a job, he definitely wont be contributing. And neither of you seemed to thrilled about the time you did live together.... Seems to me that he is broke and is using the roommates as his way to get out of telling you that. Considering you say him paying rent would have been nice, but not necessary, makes me think you pay for things? Is he just saying what he needs to to keep his sugar mama?", "NTA. You are just a convenience.  Some men will use women as long as they can, then shock, you get dumped for something better. He will say whatever it takes to string you along.  Don\u2019t think so little of yourself by hanging on.", "He can\u2019t even commit to moving in , in the same city. How in the world is he going to commit to moving out of state. He also didn\u2019t seem very happy living with you for the short period he did, plus him not paying his half of stuff is a red flag", "ESH. I don't think this is a 'broken trust' level offense. If he's being truthful his last minute switch is, at worst, very inconsiderate. \n\nAs others have echoed though, he's perhaps not being truthful. You say that this dry run went ok, it's more than likely that he also wasn't particularly excited by it either. Better to bring that up now than later imo.", "ESH. You guys need to be honest with each other about your relationship. You describe living together as \u201cok\u201d. He said it was \u201cfine\u201d. Those are pretty lackluster responses especially when you have only been together for a year. There are clearly issues you are not addressing. Maybe you just aren\u2019t feeling it or there are small things that annoy you but can be addressed. Or maybe you are just moving too fast because you have the looming deadline of the move. Talk about it before moving in together and definitely before moving cities. What will it take for you both to be excited about taking the next step in the relationship? Don\u2019t settle for \u201cok\u201d.", "NTA. You should actually be glad that this happened, because he sounds like an irresponsible mooch. He didn't pay for food or utilities or rent?? Why do you want to be with someone like that?? \n\nYou can do better.", "NTA\n\nIf he didn't help you when he stayed for the three months there is no guarantee that he will help you when you move.\n\nDid he offer up any help during those 3 months? Anything at all?\n\nMight wany to reconsider this relationship", "NTA, but your bf is and you should drop his ass.", "NTA.\n\nIf he was as committed to you as he claims, he wouldn't have renewed the lease with his current roommates. His obligation to them ended when the lease ended - he could have just told them in advance so they could find another roommate to replace him.\n\nIf he's not putting you first this early in your relationship, he never will.", "ESH. I don't think this needs to be as big a deal as you're making it. I'm not entirely sure how trust has been broken however, if he has said specifically that he's moving in and changed his mind last minute I can see why that would be annoying and inconsiderate.", "YTA, I think.\nMaybe because I'm young or something, but him renewing his lease doesn't mean you're a priority or he doesn't care about you? Your boyfriend can care about other people too.\nI'm not sure about his relationship with his roommates, but I assume that they're friends! I would feel bad leaving my friends in a bad financial spot, and I can understand your boyfriend not wanting to do that to them.", "YTA! You are pressuring your BF to live with you.\n\nYou tried living together for 3 months and it was OKAY. That is NOT a ringing endorsement for him to give up his current living situation!\n\n\"He told me he thought living together was fine...\" He shows NO enthusiasm with living with you.\n\nAccept that he doesn't want to live with you.", "ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He\u2019s shown you his priorities. Actions speak louder than words. Sorry you\u2019ve got a sucky bf, but better to find out now than later after you\u2019ve moved him in for real.", "I wonder if that's because he was still also a resident with his roommates, so still paying there too?", "Thank you!", "Thank you!", "He told me months ago he\u2019d be moving in, and that\u2019s why we had the 3 month trial. The lease ends in 2 months and he just told me yesterday he\u2019ll be renewing.", "Thank you for your perspective!", "Then why would he say otherwise?

You yourself don't appear to be all that enthusiastic about it in your post. Was your lack of interest a little obvious perhaps?", "He's telling you what he thinks you want to hear. He obviously wants to continue the relationship for the time being but he's also fine with you moving away. He's just lazy; it's hard work to get a new girlfriend, so he is placating you so he doesn't have to go find a new one until you move. You are a placeholder.", "You are not married. You are not engaged. You will be leaving within 2 years. \n\n\"He insists he wants to move in with me, but when push comes to shove, he didn\u2019t.\"\n\nYou have your answer. He no longer wants to move in with you. You need to accept that. Whether or not you want to continue a relationship with him is up to you.", "While living with you he should at minimum have contributed to your shared groceries. This is another example of him putting his roommates' needs above yours - he chose to pay for his roommates' groceries (even though their costs went down without him eating there) and chose to make you bear the financial burden of feeding the two of you. Not to mention the increase in utilities.\n\nI would take it as a blessing that you found all of this out now before planning a move with him that he likely never would go through with.", "Maybe her lack of interest directly related to his lack of not paying any rent and freeloading during his trial run?", "That\u2019s what I was afraid of. I saw the red flags in the beginning, but ignored them. I think I have to cut my losses.", "That\u2019s what bothered me. He said he had a verbal agreement with them, and even if he wasn\u2019t living there, he felt obligated to pay. We got into an argument because I told him that didn\u2019t make any sense, but he wouldn\u2019t listen.", "Yeah, it sucks but you have to look out for yourself. He sounds pretty wishy-washy and very unhelpful.", "What about his verbal agreement to move in with you?", "You\u2019re right. That\u2019s why it made me so upset when he backed out, because he only keeps his word for his roommates. I told a friend earlier today and they told me I\u2019m well within my right to end the relationship for this alone. It\u2019s disappointing because I tried so hard to make it work, but I can\u2019t do this anymore. It feels like I\u2019m his parent more than anything."]}
