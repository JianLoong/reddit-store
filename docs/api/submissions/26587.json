Alice has autism and sometimes acts in a way that looks \"strange\" to other kids who don't have autism. For example, Alice doesn't find it easy to make friends, she will usually sit by herself reading or pace around the playground by herself at lunchtimes. The kids in her class are fine with this, they often ask if she wants to join in with their conversations and games, but always respect it if she says she would rather be left alone.\n\nAll except one girl, who I will call Sarah \\[9F\\], she started at Alices school about a week ago and has been making fun of her since.  Sarah has made fun of Alice for stuff like sitting alone at break and wearing ear defenders sometimes in loud lessons like PE. I spoke to the school after Alice came home in tears and they said they would have a talk with her, in the end they gave her a 5 minute detention, however Sarah was not stopping.\n\nI spoke to Alice and said to her that while we should try to be respectful to everyone, if someone is being rude to you like Sarah is then it would be fine if she wanted to stand up for herself. She said she was scared of getting in trouble but I said I wouldn't let that happen.\n\nAlice is a very picky eater due to her autism, as a result she is quite small and skinny, whereas Sarah is quite large. At lunch she began eating her lunch when Sarah made fun of her, shaming her for eating the same thing everyday and calling her \"skeleton\".  Alice responded to this by calling Sarah a \"stupid bully\" and asking her to stop. When Sarah wouldn't stop Alice called her a \"fat pig\" and said \"you never stop eating\". Apparently people began to laugh at Sarah and she got upset and left the lunch hall crying.\n\nMe and Sarah's mother were both called in as a result, I said my daughter is allowed to stand up for herself, especially if the school and Sarah's mother isn't going to stop it. Sarah's mother said my daughter had bodyshamed Sarah and that Sarah is a kid and it makes sense she would comment on something she didn't understand.\n\nAlice's teacher decided on the following solution, Sarah and Alice would both have a 10 minute detention for insults, and if either one of them made a comment to the other one from that point on the teacher would give that person a detention instantly, no warning. Sarah's mother reluctantly agreed but I flat out refused. The teacher said I was being \"difficult\" and Sarah's mother called me an AH on the schools whatsapp group (don't know why she brought it up there)\n\nI think I am in the right, my husband agrees with my decision, Alice shouldn't learn to just take abuse, sure bodyshaming wasn't nice but it was justified completely in my eyes, but now I am wondering AITA?", "created_utc": 1694356689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16f1v6z/aita_for_letting_my_autistic_child_bully_her_bully/", "score": 829, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not being difficult, you are being reasonable in the face of the school's incompetence.\n\nAs for the school whatsapp, I would suggest that you very very calmly and dispassionately report what's been happening each and every day without school intervention and suggest that other parents who are interested in what the school is doing to stop bullying join you at the head of school's office first thing Monday morning.\n\nI hope the head has a lovely time explaining why they allow children to bully their autistic classmate daily without intervention.\n\nNTA", "I would say that given your daughter's autism just telling her to stand up for herself might not provide enough of a framework for handling the bullying.

Sounds like Sarah does not have a good example from her mother and some visits with the school counselor for her are in order as well.", "Sorry but YTA.

That\u2019s how this works.\n\nBut going further, you should steer your kid clear from viewing insults as solutions to social situations.

What I have started doing, is asking him to document everything and to not immediately respond. I have also set up my iPad to record that particular area of the room. That has stopped a lot of it because the bulies know they are being watched and their actions are being put on paper. We can't catch everything, but we try.
