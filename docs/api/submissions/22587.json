When we discussed the errands before we left the house, the grocery store was not on the list. I got ready for the day, it was hot and we'd be moving around so I chose a comfortable and breathable outfit - a pair of black exercise leggings, sneakers, and a crop tank top. I've been opting out of wearing a bra a lot lately, and decided to leave it at home. \n\nWe left for the day and when we were nearing the end of the errands, my partner suggested stopping at the grocery store to grab something to cook for dinner. He works part-time at a fancy grocery store as a second job, we don't shop here a lot because it's out of our budget but I've ran in enough times while he's been working that many of his co-workers know me. \n\nHe has a smoke and when he's done I get out of the car. He asks me \"oh you're coming in?\" I responded something along the lines of \"yes, why are you asking?\" (dumbfounded because why would I wait in the car alone with no a/c) He informed me that he didn't want me to come inside with my nipples visible and while I was wearing \"basically nothing.\" I was shocked. He's made many comments about my outfit choices over the years, but never outright did not want to be seen with me because of them. I asked him if he was serious and he responded with \"babe I work here.\" I told him I couldn't believe it an informed him I'd be waiting in the hot car. \n\nLater that day we discussed the situation even further and he told me that if I insisted on coming with him he would not have told me to stay in the car a second time, but he wouldn't have been happy if I did join him. We didn't really come to a resolution but the conversation was eventually dropped. \n\nIdk where to land on this. We've had conversations in the past regarding \"time and place.\" We're in agreement that it's not cool to wear revealing clothes like that if you're going to a place filled with children or teenage boys. But this is not the case..... If you co-workers are offended by my nipples they should keep their eyes on my face. It's not like I left the house expecting to be going to his place of work either. \n\nI just can't shake the feeling that he didn't want to be seen with me. Am I the asshole?

I too had a significantly older guy treat me like a slut for existing in public when I was in my late teens/early 20s. She can decide to sleep with whoever she wants to but it\u2019s a crimson ass flag.", "That\u2019s great. The comment I\u2019m referring to specifically mentions the grocery store part. It\u2019s definitely icky that the age gap exists how it does, but him working for a grocery store as a second job has nothing to do with it.", "reddit whenever there\u2019s an age gap :", "Even if it was one full-time job. If it pays your bills, why does it matter what he does for a living? If they\u2019re happy doing what they do, why does it matter?

That\u2019s what 90% of these \u201crelationships\u201d are. Most of the time the man is manipulative and the young lady is too naive to know.

In almost any other circumstance being braless or panty-less would be no one\u2019s business, but in that one case we all were thankful for the dress code update.", "I work at a university and never wear a bra and have never once had anyone comment on my dress. I am professional and look nice always. Nipples do sometimes show through my tops, but I do not care, and no one else ever has either.

I\u2019ll have to try and look more up on it", "I think the last time I saw something was a couple days ago. I\u2019ll have to try and find it.

Pasties or nipple duct tape aren\u2019t a normal part of attire.", "Haha flashing her beaver is not office-acceptable. But it still goes back to the outfit! If she were braless and going commando but had been wearing office-appropriate clothes, she would have been fine.", "But then she isn\u2019t following dress code.
