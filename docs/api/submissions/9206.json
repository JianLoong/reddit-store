His stepsister was doing something kind for all of you; she doesn\u2019t have to put up with being made to feel uncomfortable in return. Your husband sounds like a big bully, frankly. If I were his stepsister I wouldn\u2019t feel obligated to come back.", "NTA inappropriate husband deserved to leave.", "NTA. If your husband\u2019s gawking is making someone feel uncomfortable, he should just stop when asked. Making comments about your \u201cass\u201d in this situation is gross, and would make anyone feel awkward or embarrassed", "NTA, she was taking measurements while he was making sexual comments about you. He didn\u2019t necessarily do anything wrong, but it was awkward for his stepsister to be hearing sexual comments as she was taking measurements of your body. I think asking him to leave was the right call, and the fact that the stepsister appreciates it shows that", "NTA\n\nYou read the room and acted to make someone feel less awkward.

Are they exactly the same or just the same fabric? Is this a vow renewal? Seems odd that all the women will match.", "NTA", "\"My dear husband.  How hard is it to understand that you were making your sister uncomfortable and the kind thing to do would have been to leave?\n\nJust because YOU didn't find her discomfort to be valid doesn't mean it wasn't. \n\nNo one was dissing you here, you were just asked to step out. \n\nGetting all pissy about it and creating drama is just making it worse for everyone. \n\nBuck up, apologize to your sister, and let's move on.  You are a kinder man than this.\"", "I've seen this movie before", "YTA. It\u2019s his house too. If she gets embarrassed then why not take measurements for her project at her house.", "I believe they're all going to be the same as my husband's stepmother loves that type of thing. It's not a vow renewal.", "Usually it's the bridesmaids that wear matching dresses, maybe that's what she meant?", "That's why I asked if it's a renewal ceremony. Usually party guests don't match.", "husbands-stepsisters-parents wedding. So it's hard to say if they're just guests or if she's a bridesmaid. Depends on the relationship", "Let me get this straight: stepsister is competently performing a task, and then her stepbrother comes in and stands near her and she suddenly starts fumbling? \n\nHer stepbrother comments on *your* ass, and *she* turns red in embarrassment? \n\nYou notice her visible and severe discomfort, but both of her step siblings insist that there\u2019s nothing wrong and nothing should\u2019ve been done to ease her discomfort? \n\nSounds like a sign of a much bigger story there\u2026 one in which stepsister was not treated well by her step siblings. \n\nNTA", "No, of course not, you were NTA. That was very kind of you to be sensitive to his stepsister, seeing that she was both embarrassed and flustered with the measurements. Your SIL obviously has pre-existing resentment over their stepsister.", "This is weird in a few ways.  Why did your husband think it appropriate to make comments about your ass while someone was measuring you?  That was designed to make everyone in the room uncomfortable while he felt... what, exactly?  \n\nEdited to ask: If his inseam is being measured for a new pair of trousers, or maybe so he can rent a tuxedo and be in a wedding... is it ok for you to comment on his crotch for the surrounding audience?\n\nWhy did your step-sister-in-law feel so uncomfortable as soon as your husband started observing her efforts?  Has he made fun of her or belittled her in the past?\n\nIf it was innocent teasing on husband's part (which is entirely possible!!!), why is he still upset at being kicked out?  No big deal either way, right?\n\nNTA", "NTA how old is your husband, 12? \n\nI don't understand why stepsister was uncomfortable but it shouldn't matter. Being asked to leave someone alone isn't a big bad AH move, and he seems majorly insecure to be upset by something like that", "NTA \n\nHusband is an ass.", "NTA- but why was the stepsister embarrassed and making mistakes?", "NTA.\n\nBarge in on him when he's trying to concentrate on something, then ask him how he feels about it.\n\nHe's the AH and so's the SIL who sided with him.", "NTA. He sounds like a bit of a bully.", "NTA. I\u2019m a cosplayer and my (now estranged) grandparents used to hover over me while I sewed and I hated it. It\u2019s distracting and annoying but I couldn\u2019t ask them to leave. Good on you for recognizing and standing up for your stepsis!", "Especially depending on what point in getting measurements he made the joke. If she was, say, kneeling and measuring OP's hips or waist and he started talking about OP's ass when it was right in front of her face it would feel like he was sexualizing a totally normal part of the process of dressmaking process and change the atmosphere of the room.", "For commenting on his wife's ass? Are you kidding me? He was wrong for making the stepsister uncomfortable, but he was not a creep for talking about his wife's ass. Nothing here suggest  OP was embarrassed or uncomfortable with the comment.", "\"It's his house too\" - so she doesn't deserve a moment of peace without him observing her every move? \n\nShould everyone be forced to go to the toilet in front of him if he decides he wants to watch? \n\nShould she leave the house if she wants to have a private conversation?\n\nPeople are still allowed privacy when they live with others.", "For making comments on his wife's ass in front of someone else, yes that is being a creep.\n\nThere is no reason that he had to make comments that are generally private at that moment."]}
