If you have a concern about something, it\u2019s best to be unambiguous, but to remain polite, address the person you have the concern with privately, and remain respectful. You should also not offer unsolicited advice unless you have evidence that someone\u2019s behaviour is impacting themselves or others, or you\u2019re close enough to them to be honest and kind.\n\n\nI\u2019ve had dealings with people who\u2019ve said they\u2019re just being \u201chonest\u201d when they want to bully or degrade a person.

Yes, there needs to be a paper trail, but if the paper trail proves that his behavior and work conduct negatively impact the business (like turning away customers) and that he cannot perform his work duties, then he can absolutely be fired. Post says he's been reprimanded, just doesn't say if there were written reports.\n\nThe ADA only protects QUALIFIED employees. He is not qualified because he cannot perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations, and he is hurting the business because people are actively avoiding him.", "Autistic here, and I'll agree that the whole \"special\" thing is patronizing as fuck, but \"dehumanizing\" is kind of blowing it out of proportion.", "Similar situation, and it took me a very long time that I was hurting people with my words, when I thought I was being funny. It wasn't until someone explained that what I was saying or doing was just mean and that being around me wasn't pleasant sometimes. \n\nPerhaps you could talk to him when you're not in the heat of the moment. Talk to him about his behavior and how it affects you and others around him. And if it works, imagine all the people who's life you'll be making less shitty by not having to bare boy's antics. \n\nI think having a calm and concise conversation with someone who is being mean or rubbing others the wrong way is a very effective way of changing their behavior. It really cuts down their defense mechanism, which is mean humor and makes them more likely to stop being an ass. \n\nI doubt he even has the self awareness to realize how annoying, frustrating, and mean he's being to others, and no one wants to deal with having an uncomfortable conversation to let them know their presence is negatively affecting others. \n\nPlus you won't have to harbor all the frustration you have with him by letting it out in a constructive manner instead of zinging off a mean quip that no one would be jealous of him. \n\nYou could start with saying that you're sorry about when you told him that no one would be jealous of him. Then proceed to let him know the reason you snapped was that you've been frustrated with him. Then calmly explain that things he says and does are sometimes mean and annoying. Using I statements helps, you can say sometimes it hurts and frustrates when you do x and say y.", "Story?", "I've been working super-closely with someone to write a book together. I've learned that, when we're talking about choices relating to style or content, it's always best to say it truthfully and clearly. That way, there isn't any confusion about what we each want, and we can discuss our options from there. Sometimes we disagree passionately, and sometimes one of us concedes right away, if we don't feel strongly about it.\n\nBut we never, ever make a comment about each other's worth or value as a person. We can argue 12pt versus 14pt font until we're blue in the face, but we don't say anything hurtful about the other person.\n\nBeing this honest is something that took me a very long time to learn, and I'm so thankful I have the courage to do it now.\n\n(Of course, this isn't what's happening in the OP-- that's clearly rudeness and personal attacks. OP is NTA.)"]}
