If you have a concern about something, it\u2019s best to be unambiguous, but to remain polite, address the person you have the concern with privately, and remain respectful. You should also not offer unsolicited advice unless you have evidence that someone\u2019s behaviour is impacting themselves or others, or you\u2019re close enough to them to be honest and kind.\n\n\nI\u2019ve had dealings with people who\u2019ve said they\u2019re just being \u201chonest\u201d when they want to bully or degrade a person.

So if someone tells you what you said was rude, I think the kind and respectful response is to apologize and, if asked, explain why you said what you said, the way you said it.   \n\n\nFor me, OP was describing someone who basically doesn't care about other people's feelings, and defends it as \"just being honest\". But ironically, they didn't like it when OP was honest to them.", "Oh I 100% agree with that! I think if you call someone out for rudeness, you should try your best to be empathetic and explain why it was rude. If you\u2019re called out for being rude, it\u2019s important to ask for an explanation if this is not clear. \n\n\n\nI was concerned that you thought OP was being rude to their colleague, and thought that the colleague may have been concerned with OP being previously blunt about acceptable behaviour. If that makes sense? Upon re-reading the OP, I realise my mistake.\n\n\nWhilst being honest is incredibly important when you\u2019re neurodiverse, that doesn\u2019t mean you get to shy from your responsibilities or be an arsehole to others. If OP has confirmed they\u2019re not interested in their co-worker\u2019s religion, and have told them as much, they should involve HR at this point.\n\nEdit: autocorrect kept changing \u2018has\u2019 to \u2018had\u2019"]}
