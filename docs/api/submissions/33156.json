Your husband's disordered eating is affecting the whole household.   He wants to eat the children's food, even though he \"was full\" 20 minutes ago.

I have had disordered eating my entire adult life. We simply didn't have enough food for us kids to have snacks. We got breakfast and dinner. If my parents could afford it, lunch. No snacks. Very few treats growing up, etc.\n\nI'm still able to stay out of other people's food. I still make sure everyone has had enough to eat. I'm still able to share. I binge, but I don't eat ALL the snacks in a few days. \n\nWhat your husband is doing is straight-up ADDICTION! It stopped being food insecurity when his gluttony ramped up in the last 6 months.\n\nThis will, unfortunately, eventually destroy your marriage. The resentment felt will only increase on all sides. The longer this goes on, the worse it will get. As your children get older, they will eventually resent you for putting them and keeping them in this situation.\n\nHe needs to help himself now.  You need to stand firm in not enabling his behavior..\n\nI wish you all the good juju.

I know I can eat, that I will not go hungry and that is enough. \n\nI ran a preschool and had a child with food insecurity and every morning I took him into the kitchen and showed him the fridge and pantry were full and told him what breakfast, lunch, and snacks for the day would be. In the beginning I had to show him on the clock when we would eat and eventually he was able to get through the day without constantly asking if we were going to eat that day.", "NTA. \n\n*But...*\n\nI think a lot of people who have been replying are trying to come up with a simple solution for a very complex problem. I've known people who have suffered from food insecurity, and it's common for them to develop unhealthy relationships with food. At buffets they will eat so much that they feel physically ill. They will horde food. They will literally be in tears when expired food is thrown out. These sort of attitudes that are developed during childhood are incredibly hard to shake.\n\nYou say your husband grew up in foster care, so I think a bit of empathy is in order. People are pretty quick to excoriate the dude, but it's clear he's developed some really disordered thinking regarding food during his time in foster care if he's eating until he feels physically sick, and then wants to eat more. And if he's taking food from his family. \n\nI also think that limiting his food supply may backfire. If he does indeed have an irrational belief that he needs to eat as much food as he can because it might not be there later, then refusing to provide him with food, might reinforce that irrational belief in his mind. On the other hand, enabling his behavior isn't good either.\n\nI honestly think this one is above Reddit's paygrade.

I would NEVER eat food my child MIGHT want. I raised a son who is now an adult. He ate like a typical teenage boy. This is where my over cooking came in a little handy - lots of leftovers. But, I would eat my meal, he would eat his. He often got to the leftovers before I did. However, I can't fathom a situation in which I, as a mom, would tell my child he cannot have seconds (or leftovers) because they're \"mine\", or because I internally planned to scarf them down! I'd even ask him if he wanted the last serving before I'd heat it up! Most sane parents would skip meals before they would deny their children food!\n\nTo me, this is unforgiveable behavior and has NOTHING to do with \"food insecurity\". I'm not sure who \"diagnosed\" that as the issue, but it sounds to me like your husband has severe ED and/or gluttony issues and somewhere along the line, heard of \"food insecurity\"\tand decided that was the ideal excuse to blame so others would feel badly for calling him out on his behavior!!\n\nFrankly, any and everyone I've ever known who has experienced TRUE food insecurity behaves the opposite: we overbuy and over cook and store and save excess food \"for later, in case, etc\", even when most of the time it doesn't get eaten. NOT woofing down mass quantities of food in one sitting. Not binge eating. Do you see how that makes no sense, where as the normal hoarding of and saving food would from true food insecurity trauma? \n\nI think it's time the two of you visit a therapist who specializes in eating disorders TOGETHER, and I agree with others in the thread who have suggested he no longer eats with or benefits from the family food and meals, period.

Maybe look into a second hand fridge for the garage or basement, and store non perishables in a locking trunk or cabinet.\n\nNTA but your husband is for lying about the reasons for his behavior, AND clearly not doing anything to adjust it, even as a father of children.

My dad was like this! I\u2019m pretty sure the body shaming that started when I was too young to remember wasn\u2019t necessarily part of it, but the food portions just got more ridiculous over time. An average lunch was a few pieces of lunch meat (I weigh my lunch meat now to be sure I\u2019m getting a 2oz serving because I was serving myself 0.66ish oz servings since I thought that\u2019s what a serving was), a string cheese, and a handful of crackers. For all of us. That means that there were days I was 18, sitting with my siblings (17, 9, 5) and we were all eating the same amount. If we had lasagna, we\u2019d be given a 3x3 square and that\u2019s all. No fruit or vegetables in our home. I always thought it was a lot and hated that I wasn\u2019t allowed to get up until it was gone, but that\u2019s because I (26F) have anorexia, severe and enduring anorexia nervosa to be specific.

My sister (25F) has binge eating disorder. My younger brother (17M) has avoidant restrictive food intake disorder, which is like anorexia without the fear of weight gain. I\u2019m hoping the youngest (13M) doesn\u2019t develop one, but time will tell. \n\nMy dad would convince us small portions were appropriate and we were \u201clittle piggies\u201d and going to get fat, then get diabetes, then have our feet cut off if we ever wanted more food. We\u2019d get in trouble for \u201cstealing food\u201d if we ever had anything without asking. My dad had issues with binging. He\u2019d eat an entire bag of crisps almost every day, and we weren\u2019t allowed to have any of those because they\u2019re dad\u2019s snacks and we\u2019re already chunky. We weren\u2019t, btw. We were underweight. One time I brought home a 16\u201d cookie cake from work. When I went to bed, we\u2019d all had a slice, about 1\u201d each. Keep in mind that\u2019s 16\u201d in diameter, so 1\u201d off the circumference is negligible. We didn\u2019t even eat a quarter of it! In the morning it was gone. My dad ate the entire thing. I have absolutely NO IDEA how he did that, honestly. I can\u2019t imagine how sick he must have gotten! In my teens I liked to drink Mountain Dew and kept a 12 pack in my room, so my dad would sneak in and steal them. The soda I paid for. We were *all* hiding food, even the small children. We\u2019d get in trouble if he found out because food should only be in the kitchen and we are supposed to ask first! He needs to make sure we don\u2019t overeat! Having food he can\u2019t police means we\u2019ll overeat and get fat and- you get it. \n\n**_THIS_** is the environment you\u2019ve created for your kids.

She wasn\u2019t like that when I was a kid. I think the years of being told she was overeating finally weighed on her, and she\u2019s an adult.

And you have no clue what happens when you're not there, what they're \"allowed\" or \"not allowed\" to tell you.  He doesn't sound like a kind person or a good role model. I'm not going to say \"I'm sure he has good qualities or why would you have married him\" because people marry terrible people all the time, based on their own understanding of what constitutes an acceptable partner. You found something you \"need\" with this man,  and it could be that you are simply used to this enabling behavior, and you see it as nurturing. Or maybe you see the selfish type man as familiar, and you know how to \"love\" them. I would suggest Al-anon for you very strongly, so you can recognize the patterns in your marriage and your reactions.

She had no clue how his drinking affected me as a child because, well, the 70s were a blur for a lot of people, and you don't know what you don't know. You have a chance to protect your kids from that. Congratulations. Forget the original question. He's a grown-up that can cook for himself or get takeout or go to a restaurant. Point is, he's not going to starve. But you will be the AH if you don't put those kids first and DEMAND he get help and SHOW CHANGE or get out. Today. That's the boundary line. And I'm sorry to say, you need to be willing to enforce it and willing to say goodbye forever. He will push and prod and poke at your weak spots. He will dissemble and manipulate. He will lie, lie, lie, and lie. He will attempt to \"negotiate.\" Don't. He's lying anyway. Alanon members can help you reality check through that. But the simplest, clearest advice: draw your boundary and never ever deviate. It's food addiction, and food is required to survive, so he's going to need professional assistance. Not you.

Peanut butter was bad for us. Chips were terrible. Ice cream was for fat people. Burgers and hot dogs were only on the 4th of July. Cookies were for Christmastime. Juice was bad. Soda was bad except diet (bc aspartame and Splenda and equal were ok). Rolls at restaurants were turned away, no appetizers, no dessert, only water. Pizza was high in calories and fat.

Someone's trauma can easily lead to being abusive. I am actually pretty good with kids at least in bursts but got a vasectomy because I'd be playing with statistics on not raising my kids in abuse. Abused children grow to be adults who abuse children is a well studied statistic. \n\nJust yesterday moving a sled with propane tank, random items I lost my patience with my dog helping me.

They pretend to be humble but my mother has let me know that back in the day she almost became a beauty queen, almost became a famous actress etc.\" \n\nThey never cared about any of my accomplishments.
