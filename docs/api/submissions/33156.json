Your husband's disordered eating is affecting the whole household.   He wants to eat the children's food, even though he \"was full\" 20 minutes ago.

I have had disordered eating my entire adult life. We simply didn't have enough food for us kids to have snacks. We got breakfast and dinner. If my parents could afford it, lunch. No snacks. Very few treats growing up, etc.\n\nI'm still able to stay out of other people's food. I still make sure everyone has had enough to eat. I'm still able to share. I binge, but I don't eat ALL the snacks in a few days. \n\nWhat your husband is doing is straight-up ADDICTION! It stopped being food insecurity when his gluttony ramped up in the last 6 months.\n\nThis will, unfortunately, eventually destroy your marriage. The resentment felt will only increase on all sides. The longer this goes on, the worse it will get. As your children get older, they will eventually resent you for putting them and keeping them in this situation.\n\nHe needs to help himself now.  You need to stand firm in not enabling his behavior..\n\nI wish you all the good juju. Big hugs", "And why are you still allowing him in the same house as your children if he won't make efforts to treat his eating disorders? He's abusing the kids. ESH except the kids.", "Just curious if this issue revolves only around prepared food. I have issues with food insecurity too, but it is enough for me to know the fridge and pantry are full. I know I can eat, that I will not go hungry and that is enough. \n\nI ran a preschool and had a child with food insecurity and every morning I took him into the kitchen and showed him the fridge and pantry were full and told him what breakfast, lunch, and snacks for the day would be. In the beginning I had to show him on the clock when we would eat and eventually he was able to get through the day without constantly asking if we were going to eat that day.", "NTA. \n\n*But...*\n\nI think a lot of people who have been replying are trying to come up with a simple solution for a very complex problem. I've known people who have suffered from food insecurity, and it's common for them to develop unhealthy relationships with food. At buffets they will eat so much that they feel physically ill. They will horde food. They will literally be in tears when expired food is thrown out. These sort of attitudes that are developed during childhood are incredibly hard to shake.\n\nYou say your husband grew up in foster care, so I think a bit of empathy is in order. People are pretty quick to excoriate the dude, but it's clear he's developed some really disordered thinking regarding food during his time in foster care if he's eating until he feels physically sick, and then wants to eat more. And if he's taking food from his family. \n\nI also think that limiting his food supply may backfire. If he does indeed have an irrational belief that he needs to eat as much food as he can because it might not be there later, then refusing to provide him with food, might reinforce that irrational belief in his mind. On the other hand, enabling his behavior isn't good either.\n\nI honestly think this one is above Reddit's paygrade. You need to see a therapist who has a lot of experience with disordered eating to find out the best way to approach this. Reddit isn't the best place to get advice on medical issues from when a large proportion of posts don't even read posts properly before responding.", "NTA. You may need to decide if you want to continue exposing your children to his abusive behavior. Because what he\u2019s doing is abusive to you and the children.", "This. He will give the kids an ED.

OP/Momma this bigger than you, this is about their mental health now too.", "He's literally causing food insecurity in others! He eats other people's food!\n\nDude is an asshole.", ">he is going to wind up sending them the same way: eating fast because somebody else is going to eat it if they don't.\n\nThis^^^^^", "Agree with this \ud83d\udcaf. It\u2019s time for him to put in the work (and you support THAT) rather than have his disordered eating control the whole household and send the kids down the same path. Empathy is a wonderful thing but enabling unhealthy behavior is unhealthy for everyone.", "Yeah it would be whatever if it was just him and OP, that would be between two adults to work through. But he\u2019s literally taking food from his own kids and chances are they\u2019re going to end up suffering too. They can\u2019t even have a snack because he\u2019ll eat the whole pack? No extra portions when they\u2019re hungry, ever? Yikes.", "It is time for a divorce. He how\u2019s he doesn\u2019t want to change his very selfish. A self entitled man who thinks only of himself. Op is this how you want to liv the rest of your life because if you stay with him this is how it will be.", "Not his kids biologically. Which I think is what makes his actions so severe. The competition against them. \n\nI always wonder why people don't vet their potential spouses over long periods of time. If he showed progress from therapy he'd be redeemable, but you don't need this guy inhaling food like a vacuum.", "I thought of that, too.  Prader-Willi*, and part of managing the child is locking up every single piece of food in the house.  \n\n*OP's husband doesn't have this.  It shows up in early childhood.", "What is that disorder called, do you know? I have a friend with a 10 year old who is constantly saying she's hungry. She eats like a starving animal. She will scarf down a pint of ice cream in 10 minutes and then start begging others for their food. At Thanksgiving one year when she was 8 she had enough for an adult man, at one point reaching for dinner roll number five. It's horrifying to watch. She is constantly begging and whining for food and then asking right after she's had lunch what they are having for dinner and if they get to have dessert. I don't know how she doesn't end up vomiting she eats so much.", "THIS. I have food insecurity from my childhood, I over buy and over cook. I am also a mom. I would NEVER eat food my child MIGHT want. I raised a son who is now an adult. He ate like a typical teenage boy. This is where my over cooking came in a little handy - lots of leftovers. But, I would eat my meal, he would eat his. He often got to the leftovers before I did. However, I can't fathom a situation in which I, as a mom, would tell my child he cannot have seconds (or leftovers) because they're \"mine\", or because I internally planned to scarf them down! I'd even ask him if he wanted the last serving before I'd heat it up! Most sane parents would skip meals before they would deny their children food!\n\nTo me, this is unforgiveable behavior and has NOTHING to do with \"food insecurity\". I'm not sure who \"diagnosed\" that as the issue, but it sounds to me like your husband has severe ED and/or gluttony issues and somewhere along the line, heard of \"food insecurity\"\tand decided that was the ideal excuse to blame so others would feel badly for calling him out on his behavior!!\n\nFrankly, any and everyone I've ever known who has experienced TRUE food insecurity behaves the opposite: we overbuy and over cook and store and save excess food \"for later, in case, etc\", even when most of the time it doesn't get eaten. NOT woofing down mass quantities of food in one sitting. Not binge eating. Do you see how that makes no sense, where as the normal hoarding of and saving food would from true food insecurity trauma? \n\nI think it's time the two of you visit a therapist who specializes in eating disorders TOGETHER, and I agree with others in the thread who have suggested he no longer eats with or benefits from the family food and meals, period. Until he can grow up and get a grip on his eating, he eats and prepares his food separately, and does NOT have access to the family stash. Maybe look into a second hand fridge for the garage or basement, and store non perishables in a locking trunk or cabinet.\n\nNTA but your husband is for lying about the reasons for his behavior, AND clearly not doing anything to adjust it, even as a father of children. Who is ok denying his own kids food/seconds so he can further gorge himself. Absolutely disgusting.", "He was 180ish when we met. No gut or anything. That changed quick.", "Not healthy. 5'10\" and like 250. Big guy.", "My daughters were adopted from Asian orphanages. Both were under nourished. The first carried a handful of cheerios in her fist for a very long time.  I always had to have food on me. My second was slightly malnourished but needed to know when & what our next meal was. If we went on a car ride longer than the grocery store, the kids were asking for snacks. And where we would get our next meal. Even if we made sandwiches and travelled with a cooler, the kids were still worried about their next meal.\n\nWe worked with a therapist to get over their food insecurity. It took a while but they learned how to manage it without eating everyone else\u2019s food. Your husband is a selfish prick.
