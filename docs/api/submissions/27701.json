She is focused on her career and yet was willing to spend one week with you and your family after 5 yrs NC.  But you pushed for two.  She wanted her own space, but you pushed her to agree to stay at your sisters condo instead of an ABNB.  After being disrespected by your sister, she wanted to leave.  But you convinced wife to stay.  It was decent of your sister to apologize, but your wife gets to decide what, if any, relationship she wants with sister.  You can have whatever relationship you want with your family and your wife has said as much per your post.\n\nYou are the AH for not listening to your wife, for pushing her to do what you want, and then invalidating her feelings after your sister behaved poorly.

She also no doubt had a good idea of how much wotk time she would need to be doing while on this trip. Her saying 1 week & AirBnB made sense.\n\nYou don't say why you did not like that idea, and insisted that she had to come for 2 weeks *and* stay at your sister's condo. Probably not the best of choices in this case, but it could have gone ok if you'd done what you admit you didn't do... defend your wife.\n\nI suspect a major reason why she's pissed is because, when she agreed to your plan, she expected you to run interference with *your family* when her work intruded. Which you didn't do.\n\nYou know your wife. You know her job and the stress she's feeling. You also know your sister and how different she is from your wife.\n\nYou should have been running interference for your wife and defending her busy schedule in any case. But that became more important when you decided that you both had to stay with your sister. It was your version of the arrangements that you were going with, despite your knowledge of how limited her time would be. It was your job to step in when her work commitments conflicted with your sisters plans for outings.\n\nAnd really, how hard would it have been? \"Oh that sounds fun. I'm in. Wife has meetings most of the day. She'll call when she's free to connect up with us.\" \"I can go. Wife won't be available until dinner time. Are we eating here or at dad's?\"\n\nHonestly, the expectations around her availability should have been set well before you even got there. Your sister (and the rest of the family) should have been clear that she was still going to be working the entire time.\n\nBut instead of defending your wife, it sounds like you left her to hang out to dry when your sister couldn't handle the fact that your wife wasn't all in for her plans.\n\nSo its no wonder your wife said:\n>that she needed time to \"reevaluate whether her needs are being met in this marriage\" and that she was \"disappointed in me and could see that when it comes to my family I will never have her back\"\n\nThat sounds to be pretty accurate, especially the last part.

Your wife was taking a big step by allowing your racist family back into her life. \n\nYour first mistake was pressuring your wife to stay for longer than she was comfortable with and not respecting her desire to stay at a neutral location. \n\nYour wife communicated to you that she had work obligations, yet you failed to stand up for her when your sister gave her a hard time for needing to do her work. \n\nYou are expecting your wife to acknowledge that your family had changed, but the first time she interacts with them a member of your family treats her badly and you fail to step up. The point was not to gang up on your sister, but to make your wife feel supported when she has put herself in a vulnerable position for your benefit.", "Info: did anyone besides your dad apologize?

You ignored your wife's attempts at creating a safe space for herself from your \"previously\" racist family at an airbnb, and you shot that down. She also tried to set a time limit, which you also ignored. Then you silently watched her be screamed at and humiliated by your sister. Now you're feeling like the victim?! Look, sincerely, you're very wrong in this situation. You should be on your knees begging for her forgiveness, but I can see you are blind in the comments. You're missing the point of your wife's recent words; she has just gotten a glimpse of her shiny future. Now she gets to decide if this is what she wants, and buddy... nobody would want this. I appreciate that you want to move on, but accountability is still to be had. You can't pretend there's no racist anything towards your wife if this split your family up for 5 years.

One because she is your wife, two because it sounds like your sister was out of line. \n\n>No point of getting angry and then making my sister feel ganged up on.\n\nSo its ok to let your wife feel ganged up on? This statement shows that you place more value on your sister, who was clearly out of line, than your wife. This is likely what your wife is referring to when she says that, \"when it comes to my family I will never have her back\". \n\nYou owe your wife HUGE apology. Which may not be enough but is a start. This situation is above Reddit's pay grade. I would suggest counseling and see if that makes your wife feel better about staying in your marriage.

Not just that she thought she was to good for them and better than them with her job? You need to listen to your wife\u2019s experience. You f\u2019ed up by not stepping into the fight to tell your sister to back off as your wife was disrupting her work routine and trying to accommodate her work with the lack of planning my family.

She had to stay on alert the whole time because she didn\u2019t know how the situation might turn\u2026and when it did you didn\u2019t immediately back her so she felt alone in a hostile situation.

To me, a black girl, this speaks volumes.  More so, if your family was against the opinions of your father , I'm sure they would have taken all the necessary steps to at least let it be known and to keep the contact with you.\n\nSo please, stop to deny the true... because between  two options , one is valid: or they agree totally with your father, or they don care enough to you or you wife to stand up for you and to keep contact.\n\n\nSecond: there's a history here in Reddit were the op's brother cheat with op's girl friend.

For a bunch of racists that, after ten years, decided she\u2019s finally good enough to hang out with them?\nBut of course, she\u2019s the ungrateful one, I mean they even took her to a 5-star-restaurant! /s\n\nYTA so much and I really hope your poor wife finds someone who supports her, who doesn\u2019t sabotage her work schedule and who stands up for her against racists!", "I\u2019d rather eat at Wendy\u2019s and not have to deal with terrible family dynamic bs.", "You know- you could have ended the argument by calmly turning to your sister and saying \"if you feel it is OK to talk to *my wife* that way then this trip is over.\"\n\nYou sister would have apologised. Your wife would have felt like you backed her up.\n\nYou fucked up BIG. Stop arguing with people and own it before you lose your wife (who is a saint for even accepting this 'olive branch' int he first place)", "Were these the things that your sister planned during the time that your wife was trying to work?", ">That's ignoring all the kind things my family did during the two weeks. We were treated incredibly well, heck my dad and my wife got along better than anyone else! \n\nNo.  YOU were treated well.  \n\nAnd even if she was that doesn't forgive your sister going off on her for the grand crime of....taking a call.  \n\nShe was attacked after not even wanting to go and you sat there like a houseplant.  \n\nYou're showing more of a spine online defending your pathetic behavior.", "Thats because they are YOUR family and you are making excuses for them.\n\nYes they treated her BETTER but even **being a little hostile or a little racist is still hostile and racist.**\n\nYou convinced your wife to stay with your sister and your sister decided to attack and insult her!!!  You then convinced her to stay because \u201cyour sister will apologise as she\u2019s only a little racist now\u201d.\n\nThey may have improved but your wife still feels your family are being prejudice towards her (and really not sure why you mentioned that you are south Asian.).\n\n**You let your wife be disrespected by your sister so your sister would feel \u201cganged up on\u201d for being judgemental and attacking your wife** \\- and you really don\u2019t understand why your wife thinks you are picking your family side over her (cause they are only a little judgemental and racist now)????\n\nYTA", "People do change, but sometimes the damage is done and well, and your dad just saying he\u2019s not racists now doesnt mean your wife magically has to forgive him.", "Do you understand that this has nothing to do with your father?\n\n\nYour **sister** is the problem here. Just because part of your family accepted your wife and got along with her and made \"progress\", doesn't mean you can let go when she is treated unfairly. \n\nYour *sister* disrespected your wife, after you convinced her to stay with her, you didn't defend your wife because others got along well with your wife, and then you convinced your wife to stay at a house she was unwelcome in, uncomfortable and that belong to a person who verbally abused her.", "Is your dad changes or he is getting old in age and has decided to fake it to make nice with YOU. Also, you asked if you were the AH but you don't seem to want to hear the answer. You are hellbent on defending your family who has NOT CHANGED. Some of them just hide it well. Your sister was a douchecanoe to your wife and you said NOTHING. You failed to protect the woman you vowed to protect. You are the absolute AH.

The hurt is still there, and if the people who caused it really intend to make up for it, they can\u2019t just do the same base level shit with the benefit of the doubt as they might have been able to before. \n\nYou need to understand your wife was clearly already on edge about this to begin with, which she had EVERY right to be.

And then you didn\u2019t even fucking stand up for her when one of your family members yelled at her?\n\nYour fuckup didn\u2019t start with staying silent (although you should not have stayed silent). You expect your wife to be so understanding of all these circumstances but you don\u2019t seem to be at all understanding of hers.

He got old and a pandemic happened so he probably lost friends and needed some suckers to hang out with.  \n\nAnyways its for the best.  She can leave you and you can go stew in your family's racism.", "I find it funny that you posted here, people are giving their judgement and advice, and you are rejecting that. Why the f did u post?\n\nI disagree about your sister. It's been years, and your family is supposedly trying to make amends. Supposedly. Your dad did great, but your sister completely failed such that your wife is considering splitting. This was not the time to be immature and petty. I will wager your wife thinks that your sister's behavior is based in racism, and her opinion is the ONLY one that matters here. But you do you, and keep burying your head in the sand.  TALK TO YOUR WIFE and get her opinion on your sister. And freaking apologize for not standing up for her. DO BETTER!", "Hope she leaves", "No.  Yes. and No.  In that order.", "\"One day my sister lost her temper at my wife, called her a child and accused her of sabotaging the trip\"\n\n\"my sister ranted about my wife and said she was better than her due to her job and that she was a child who had it easy because she got married early\"\n\nAll you saw was your sister feeling jealous and slighted. You didn't see your wife being insulted to her face?\n\nWhat would constitue \"crossing the line\" for you?", "Wrong.  Your sister crossed numerous lines and you did nothing.", "Wow. It\u2019s astonishing that you don\u2019t think any of your sister\u2019s comments were crossing the line and are now shocked that your poor wife is reevaluating things.", "What you saw was your sister crossing the line.

He wasn\u2019t racist to you. He owes your wife an apology. o", "I thought you weren\u2019t in communication with your family because of your wife race? Your father did it to both of you.

Just because your family is hiding their racism a little better doesn't mean it isn't there.\n\nYou put your wife in an awful position. You should have NEVER insisted you stay with your sister or talk her into staying longer than a week. Your family had to earn her trust treating her decently, and they just couldn't do it.\n\nThe reality is you proved your family's feelings are more important than your wives and as long as their racisim isn't completely overt, you will ignore it and cajole her to suffer through it because \"family\".\n\nShe now knows your backbone is artificial. She knows that you won't defend her and she can't trust you to protect your future children either.\n\nYou are being manipulative, weak and a terrible partner.

My wife knows that.", "\ud83d\udcaf this!", "My wife had no issues with my sister until the fight.\n\nNow she says that my sister has been giving her \"microaggressions\" and even commented on her curly hair in a negative light.\n\nTbh this is a reach my wife is gorgeous and everyone who sees her tells her that. The argument came from my sister feeling jealous of her and not any racism.\n\nYall clearly havent seen how south asian families operate there is also drama but that doesn't mean the love isnt there", "DING DING DING!!!!   That\u2019s the answer!", "Whatf part of for FIVE years I cut off my parents?\n\nHow is that not putting her first?

Doubtful.", "This kind of Arguing with us is against aita rules", "Has he addressed this with your wife? Have you spoken to your wife about it? \n\nThis sounds like with your dad and now your sister you just want your wife to get over it, which really is completely invalidating her feelings.", "Reconciliation only works if *he* acknowledges the fucking *harm* he chose, as a grown adult, to cause your wife.\n\nYou are so far up your dad's ass at this point I'm surprised he isn't coughing up hairballs.", "If I were your wife and I chose to stay with you I would be reluctant to have children with you because you wouldn't protect them (your mixed race children) from your racist family.   Yes, your father expressed remorse for his behavior to *you*, but did he offer your wife a sincere apology?  Or did he just say sorry to you and expect your wife to just *forget* that he chose not to speak to his son for 5 years for marrying a woman of a different race?", "Your kids will be mixed. I hope you get a lot more serious about realizing how terrible your family is before you put your kids in harms way too.", "Yet you put your wife in a situation she didn't want to be in and let your sister do what she did to her.

And just because you do not believe that your wife was not bothered until the incident, she just told you she was. Please realize what the other commenters here have, your wife feels that your sister treated her poorly. And she did. I do not give a crap about how your EXTENDED family operates. Your WIFE IS YOUR PRIMARY FAMILY. Do I need to repeat that? If you keep doing what you are doing, you will lose her - and you will deserve to.  You suck, dude.

When sis boiled that  over to assholeness , you must stood there, that makes you the AH.

I\u2019d be genuinely surprised if your wife doesn\u2019t file for divorce.", "No, your wife is definitely not feeling the love there.  In fact, you realize that, even if she stays with you, she's probably never visiting them again, right?", "YTA! Bro, what the fuck. My family is South Asian. Our community is racist as fuck. The entire social class hierarchy is built on on us being racist *to each other*. We sell skin bleaching creams like \u201cFair & Lovely\u201d. This isn\u2019t drama, this is *racism*. Drama is the oldest granddaughter dying her hair blue.\n\nYour wife absolutely had issues with your sister until the fight, but she was being far classier than your sister deserved and keeping quiet about them.  \n\nAlso you acting like a nice dinner and a hike up a mountain erases the racism your wife experienced (and I can guarantee you is STILL experiencing) at the hands of your entire family (not just your sister) is WILD.\n\nGenuine question\u2014would your father have refused to come to your wedding/gone no contact with you if you\u2019d married a quite woman?
