In my opinion, Max is the AH in this situation.", "NTA,\n\nnot going to any second dates if he expects someone to disclose medical information on a first date\n\nAre you telling me that he cannot tell after dating for 4 months?  I assume that he has hands and have gotten pass third base.    Unless it was his first pair.", "NTA. I have implants too and I love em. Anyone who doesn\u2019t can F off", "NTA. Max is dealing with \"cognitive dissonance\" and has to work out his feelings for himself. He either has to decide he's not as repulsed by implants as he thought he was, or decide he doesn't like you as much as he thought he did. \n\nYou could end the tension of waiting for him to figure himself out by breaking up with him yourself first. You're only 4 months in at this point.", "He did you a favor by leaving. NTA.", "Nta. Trash took itself out. Don't let it back in. You've only been together 4 months, your medical history is none of his business. He sounds shallow and his opinion that women get implants for the express purpose of turning men on is gross.", "Oh my what. You should have disclosed it on the first date?! \n\nI laughed, that\u2019s how appalled I am by the nerve of this guy. How narcissistic to think that he has a RIGHT to your personal life and info about it. \n\nGirl, even if you were MARRIED you wouldn\u2019t have to disclose such information. \n\nNTA but I would kick him to the curb and never look back.", "NTA. Who starts a first date with disclosing medical procedures cosmetic or otherwise?", "NTA. I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s been some under shirt action in your 4 months, how did he not feel the difference? Either way it\u2019s your place to tell him if and when", "NTA - bf had a very black/white version of how the world is  and you just showed him that there is gray.\n\nHe should have disclosed that he was a closed minded a$$ on your first date.\n\nBullet dodged - your ex is incapable of compromise, and you know that now - move on.", "Fuck no, you're NTA. OMG. I can't type. How old is this prick of a BF? Get a real grown up adult partner. You deserve better, x", "NTA. How long of a list of corrections does Max expect on a first date? Braces? Contacts? Lotion to make your skin smooth? Does he need to know what makeup a date uses so he's aware of what's real and what's not? What about hair color and perm/straightening? A list of where you shave so you don't lead him on about where you grow body hair? Max is an idiot and you've had a lucky dodge if this is how shallow he is.", "NTA- he couldn\u2019t even tell and probably would have never found out if he wasn\u2019t a prick who made comments on other peoples choices. Nothing wrong with plastic surgery", "To insist on such deeply personal information to be disclosed on the first date suggests that his way of looking at women is as a sum of parts that he finds attractive, and need to be checked to his liking and comfort level. It never came up until now, which is how couples share their lives and histories to each other. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nYou sprung it on him when he was trying to act like women with implants turn him off. \n\nMost guys like pretty noses and large breasts whether or not surgery was involved, *which is why so much cosmetic surgery is paid for by husbands and boyfriends*. \n\nHe\u2019s licking his wounds.", "Nta. It's not something you openly discuss in the first date.", "NTA and he's doing you a favor by ghosting you.\n\nI have no idea why you'd tell someone about that kind of surgery on a first date.  Max is an idiot and you may have dodged a bullet here  :)", "NTA. You\u2019ve only been together 4 months, he\u2019s being unreasonable, ignorant, and immature, none of which are desirable traits in a partner. You may want to think carefully if he\u2019s the right person for you.", "Nta, your boyfriend has werid and crappy standards", "NTA. It's only been 4 months.

You sure you wanna date this guy, sis? \n\nTo counter his \u201coh you should have told me on the first date\u201d, you\u2019ll note that he didn\u2019t tell you he was made of red flags did he?\n\nMove on move on move on. Cut bait.", "LOL What a nerd. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA - you shouldn\u2019t have to disclose your medical history for someone to date you", "NTA.   And if he comes back DTMFA!", "NTA- But don\u2019t give him time to consider things. End him and make him your ex", "NAH. There was no particular onus on you to disclose on the first date, but it's also perfectly understandable that he feels these were lies of omission. This is, unfortunately, one of those gray areas.", "Wow!\n\nThere's a saying \"you dodged the bullet\"\n\nGlad you found out early.", "NTA. If he couldn\u2019t tell already, then it\u2019s not about your attractiveness unless he\u2019s a creep who feels like he\u2019s been \u201cdeceived\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s great that he wants a minute to think because it gives you time to realize that you can do better. Unless the next words out of his mouth are, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I overreacted\u201d, dump his ass.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to have a preference against cosmetic procedures, or not to be attracted to some of the results. But it\u2019s obviously not the latter and if the former is THAT important to him, HE had a responsibility to disclose it, not you.", "NTA - Sounds like Max is projecting his own insecurities and is a sucker for stereotypes. He has no idea what he\u2019s talking about.", "Lol no, Max is a fuckin weirdo\n\nNTA", "NAH I think. You had no obligation to tell him. It's your body, your past and your choices. His reaction was rude, but he is entitled to his preferences. If it really bothers him then y'all should break up. (Edit: read a couple other judgments and I agree \"you should have told me on the first date\" is very stupid and insulting. That was an AH move on his part)", "NTA.. Why would you even think you are the AH for not disclosing what you chose to do with your body. The only time I think someone needs to disclose a surgery if it is a a genital reassignment surgery. \n\nHowever I am very sorry that disgustingly shallow male expectations of women have made you feel so uncomfortable with yourself that you felt like you needed fix yourself. Even if it were only women that bullied you, they only did so because they were also taught my male society that small boobies are a sign of an inferior woman.", "NTA. Whatever makes you happy is what makes you happy. Fuck that guy.", "Trash took itself out NTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe someone info about your body on a first date. I\u2019m shocked he said that.  I think its something to tell someone when you\u2019re ready. You\u2019ve been dating 4 months, so not that long. He showed you who he really is. If that\u2019s a deal breaker for him, your better off without him.", "NTA - should\u2026 should I disclose that I don\u2019t have tonsils to my partner?? That I got them removed??\n\nLiterally, it\u2019s been four months and relatively minor surgeries. If this was such a big deal to him he should\u2019ve broached the subject initially and not passed judgement over your shoulder on to your old classmate.", "[removed]", "Nta, he's being an idiot.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nIt certainly wasn't his business on your first date.  I'm assuming he's seen your boobs by now, and if he hasn't noticed, I don't know why he cares that much.", "Unless you had specifically had lied about it (which isn't the case) NTA", "NTA. Tell him he should have disclosed that he\u2019s a close-minded jerk during the first date and now you need to reconsider this relationship.", "NTA.\n\nPeople who get cosmetic surgeries shouldn\u2019t have to explain themselves in order to be worthy of a relationship. Men claim to love a \u201cnatural\u201d woman, but in all honesty, most have no idea what that looks like. \n\nPlus, any good cosmetic surgeon can make it look incredibly natural, so it always makes me laugh when men cite a woman who\u2019s known to have work done as his \u201cideal natural woman.\u201d", "Max just did you a favor. This is incredibly weird behavior. Why on earth would you tell someone something like this the moment you start dating them? Max sounds controlling and shallow and weird. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou lucked out that he showed you this side at four months in. You could have been married before you found out he\u2019s this shallow/misogynistic.", "NTA. You don't have to disclose it unless you want to. He got angry at you but in reality, he was angry with himself because he didn't notice you had them.", "NTA\n\nHis reaction and comment that you \"should've disclosed this on the first date\" makes him childish.", "NTA - you don't have to disclose whether you had work done, regardless of the reason. And I bet even though this guy likes \"natural\" girls he doesn't want to see any leg or armpit hair...", "Nta- You rocked this man\u2019s disgusting world views. Let him now admire you from afar.", "NTA. Sounds like you dodged a bullet.", "He has had 4 girlfriends before me so I assume he has, I had a great surgeon though and everything does look very natural. I think he just had an expectation all implants look like solid circles strapped onto a chest and he can\u2019t fathom that\u2019s not the case.", "Exactly this. Bullet dodged OP", "this, all this.\n\nNTA", "Hey now, leave us nerds out of this!", "That\u2019s what I thought. Even though it\u2019s mainly cosmetic history, clearly he liked how I look enough to start dating me so what\u2019s the issue lol", "Bruh you don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole for leaving and not talking to her for a day? Also they\u2019ve been dating for 4 MONTHS!

I don\u2019t tell people I\u2019ve had my tonsils out or other random surgeries because\u2026why would I?", "Honestly I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong but based on how he\u2019s acting about this when he\u2019s been a great partner the past 4 months has me so confused I wanted reassurance.\n\nIt definitely sucks that I grew up with it (from both men and women) and that other girls continue to do so, there\u2019s nothing wrong with anyone\u2019s natural bodies.
