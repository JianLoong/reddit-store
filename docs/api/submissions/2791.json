You are not their full time Nanny, and taking care of their kid is their responsibility, not yours.   She just wants a break from her kid for free.", "NTA and this is a hard boundary you need to put down right now.

She's not entitled to your time. Not one bit.", "NTA. You don\u2019t work for them. Incredible entitled", "What? NTA and specifically not: no ah here. Your SIL is being an entitled AH.

Not even for a second.\n\nFeel free to let her have it for assuming that you were her employee.

Please tell me this is a joke.", "NTA They think they are entitled to your time to use you as a babysitter as they please and they somehow think what they do in their day is more important that whatever you planned for your own life.

If they weren\u2019t getting their house renovated, and we\u2019re still at home who would be watching the child we hike she went and got her nails done? \n\nNTA. Stick to your routine. You\u2019re not responsive for their childcare.
