Inform your SIL you require a minimum of 24 hours notice of babysitting duties and that she is to ASK you and not DEMAND of you to do so which means if you say no then the answer is no. When putting these boundaries up please make sure you get up early on the days you know she wants you to babysit and you don't want to and leave the house. Leave the house and don't answer her calls or texts (though screen them in case she pulls a Reddit crazy and leaves her child unattended to force you to babysit, if she does do this don't go home just call the police and inform them of the abandoned child), however if you do answer her simply say something to the effect of: \"I am unavailable SIL, maybe next time.\" And just repeat that.\n\nIt's difficult, but don't feel guilty for establishing reasonable boundaries like SIL needs to properly arrange childcare for her own child.", "NTA.
