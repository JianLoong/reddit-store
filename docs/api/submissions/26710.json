We have chosen a modest dress which I can wear with a hijab, and there are no qualms on that front.\n\nThe issue comes with her bachelorette party. She wants a Vegas themed party and all the girls must wear bikinis in coordinating colours. Now, I wouldn't mind this if I was just in the company of women, but I cannot show my body off in front of men, and two of the bridesmaids are my SIL's gay best friends (M24 and M25).\n\nThese two guys are lovely and I have absolutely no issue with them, but I cannot wear a bikini in front of them. I tried to compromise with my SIL and wear something modest but still in the colour scheme, but she says I am being homophobic and ruining the vibe of the party. She said if I can't wear a bikini, then I shouldn't bother being a bridesmaid at all.\n\nMy husband said I need to do whatever makes me feel comfortable, but my MIL (F62) is saying that I am driving a wedge in the family over nothing, and it isn't like I have never worn a bikini before and I can set aside my \"ideas\" for one night. She said that they don't count as men under the Muslim definition because they are gay and won't look at me \"like that\", and I am purposefully being difficult.\n\nMy SIL has followed through with uninviting me over this, and said she'll never be able to see me the same way again because of my selfish behaviour.

While it's one thing to make your bridesmaids wear an ugly shade of green or something, it's quite different to demand they violate their comfort zones to this degree. It doesn't make a difference to me if you don't want to wear a bikini for religious reasons or body image reasons or... any reason.

But this isn't about me.  Dressing modestly is important to you.  Your SIL is doing the same thing that your religion is doing by dictating your dress - BUT, her rules make you uncomfortable.  Why would she want one of her guests to be uncomfortable?  You seem to be willing to find something that works and don't seem to mind that everyone else will be in bikinis (are the men going to wear bikini tops or does she make exceptions for them?), so I just don't see the big deal.

Well, that sounds perfectly reasonable. You are NTA here. \n\n Bottom line, neither SIL nor MIL take your religious conversion seriously. To them, it is a phase that you can shrug off when inconvenient (for them, they could care less if it is convenient for you).

You have raised your difficulties sensibly, and your beliefs have been dismissed as 'ideas'.  Incidentally, I blinked very hard at the idea that your SIL's gay friends don't count as men.  I wonder how they feel about that?\n\nThe way I see it, the person making unreasonable demands here is not you.  You are NTA.

Even if that made it OK under your religion (I don't know, but I would certainly take the word of a Muslim over a non-Muslim for it), but you know that there will be male strippers at this party. Vegas style party, there is no question male strippers will be there.", "NTA regardless of religion not all woman are comfortable to wear a bikini , your S.I,L is completely disrespecting you .What is it with weddings bringing out the worst in people ?", "NTA. Your faith and principles are not something you can set aside so you \u201cdon\u2019t ruin her vibe.\u201d She\u2019s being disrespectful of you and your religion. Attend as a guest.

Add to that SIL would want pictures from her bachlorette, so there would be pictures circulating of yourself in a revealing costume with which you were already uncomfortable. Your boundaries about dressing yourself are reasonable and valid.\n\nIt sounds like SIL sees her wedding party as her puppets, without autonomy nor a right to choose what they consent to do. She has made an unreasonable demand. You are 100% right to refuse to humiliate yourself for her \"vision\" of her wedding and related events. Her reasons or expectations don't erase or reduce your right to choose to remain within your personal boundaries to protect your safety, privacy and comfort.\n\nA reasonable person would accept your choice of outfits, and let you bow out of an uncomfortable party. A controlling abusive person would demand you violate your boundaries because \"your role as bridesmaid\" requires it.

Choosing not to wear a bikini around anyone is not homophobic. Quite frankly, your SIL had the opportunity to have you in a coordinating outfit and choosing to include you. Her gay BFFs are not going to be in bikinis. \n\nMaking you wear a bikini when you very clearly do not want to, will not even if you wanted to, are perfectly fine lines to draw. Your MIL can go kick rocks.\n\nIf you had done this, you probably would have not felt great about it, and in future if you ever said, \"I cannot do X because of my religion,\" they would all bring this up as a reason to set aside your religious convictions.", "NTA- I am not a Muslim woman and I wouldn\u2019t be happy to be asked to wear a bikini to appease a bride. It isn\u2019t selfish, you would be uncomfortable.", "NTA. I'am a gay man and your SIL  is the actual one being homophobic by not thinking of her gay friends as men before anything else, because this is the real issue. And you can absolutly wear something modest and still have fun with the guest, you don' drive any wedge it's bullshit. The way you talk about the gays show that you are not homophobic, and their sexuality have nothing to do with anything. You didn't ask for a dress code exception op, you ask to have the right to present your body the way you are the most confortable with in presence of men. You didn'task them to not go to the party, now it would have a been a very different situation. You handle all of this the correct way, I hope you are going to be fine op", "Absolutely nta.

If a wedge is being driven in the family, it's your SIL's fault not saying it's ok you wear whatever you feel comfortable with. Also, to the cost of being ageist, I don't think a 62 yo woman is the best person to set an example of what is respectful to do regarding a young woman who converted to a religion different than hers, unless she is super progressive and informed, which she doesn't seem to be. It's good your husband is on your side on this, you don't have anything to feel bad about and I hope you won't do something you'd regret or that will make you uncomfortable for the sake of peace with relatives who are disrespecting you and manipulating you. I'd just politely decline the invitation to the party unless your SIL agrees with you wearing something you are ok with.", "NTA and honestly, it's pretty homophobic of her to treat her male gay friends as women. They might get along with women, but they're still men and it's pretty homophobic of her to want to erase that fact. Being gay doesn't make a man suddenly become a woman.", "NTA, if she can\u2019t get over your beliefs and make an exception, then she probably doesn\u2019t deserve you there", "She Is TA. I'm atheist but i understand other religions, She doesn't???? She Is Just a bad person.", "Your SIL sounds very unreasonable. They both sound pretty toxic.

Your SIL is the bigot, not you. Your values aren't up for debate or negotiation.", "No your not the AH, you MIL and SIL absolutely are. They're telling you your religious beliefs don't matter to them as much as the optics of this. You've compromised very reasonably, and your SIL is acting like you not displaying skin ruins her party. It's insane and selfish of her. She's an AH.", "How is the choice of OOP not to wear a bikini, for whatever reason, is selfish? SIL is being nasty over nothing. She excluded someone just so the clothes can coordinate. I don't understand it.", "INFO: are the men wearing bikinis too? If not, that's pretty hypocritical of SIL to allow exceptions for them but not for you. \n\nAnd tbh the dress code should be color based rather than specific attire based.

She probably agreed to it then had 2nd thoughts and is using this as an excuse. Because making someone wear a bikini is nuts to me. Seems unlikely everyone in her wedding party wants to wear one. What about the gay friends? What are they wearing? She probably realized there'd be a bridesmaid with a hijab in all her pictures and she doesn't want that. Even the most obtuse person kniws a Muslim woman who wears a hijab will be uncomfortable in a bikini.

I wore bikinis on a handful of occasions when younger, but just because I managed to cope with wearing them in the past, it doesn't make my current opinions on wearing them any less valid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, I'm a bit disappointed by all the rude and judgemental comments being aimed at you over your religion. It's one thing for people to not want to follow a particular religion, and to criticise specific situations where someone has been treated badly because of them being female, but it's really unfair to act as if an entire religion is misogynistic, when misogyny can be defined and interpreted in many different ways. For example, for every woman who finds conservative dress misogynistic, there's a woman who finds it to be empowering, and so long as their dress works for them, and doesn't go too extreme in either direction (eg, so long as we don't have people running around completely naked in public, or covered head to toe to the point where they are entirely unidentifiable), it's nobody's business how other people dress.", "NTA.

I'd be curious if any of them are married or what their parents stance is. Again I can provide sources but you can also find many modern mullanahs that will still say the reason islam is the true religion is it doesn't bend to the world. \n\nYou know 3 Muslims. I was Muslim. I didn't just leave overnight. I tried other sects. I tried to reinterpret or loosen things. I tried different mosques. Ultimately I realized I was being a hypocrite because islam doesn't fit into a modern belief system and no doctoring would change that. I was only trying to change it to fit me because I felt guilt for leaving and could fall back on it, not because it matched who I was.\n\nPlenty of people in insular cultures and religions do that.\n\nIran is a Muslim majority country and the women are trying to change things for themselves and I think that's awesome, but it is still considered unislamic in the Muslim world.", "No it isn't.

Sure, a lot of the casino hotels have fancy pools, but if I were invited to a Vegas themed party it wouldn't occur to me that pools and bikinis would even be involved unless I'd been told \"Vegas themed **pool** party\".

Totally agree.", "What's a \"homosexual tendency\"? Being gay isn't like having a food craving.", ">Clarification, islam does not deny the existence of gay people.\n\nDepends a lot on who you ask. As a rule, like any organized religion of this scale, you cannot say \"islam does\" or \"islam does not\" with very few exceptions.\n\nThe traditional view on homosexuality in most of Islam is similar to how it was in effectively all of Christianity until the late 19th century (and still is among quite a few Christian sects today). Which is to say: there are no gay people, just people who commit homosexual acts. Homosexual urges are seen as a corruption or depravity, rather than something intrinsic to the person. They might also argue that homosexual urges are an extreme form of fetish, one that can be unlearned.\n\nThis view is common across the Abrahamic tradition, which is why you get seemingly absurd claims like there are \"no gay people\" in a given country; they're not denying that people in their country engage in homosexuality, they're denying that such people should be treated as though their interest in the same gender is core to their identity.", "So it doesn\u2019t matter how wrong or right an argument is, if the person saying is not the right person, it is not right?

So a muslim woman would still need to cover in front of a transgender woman. Most liberal muslims will respect pronouns. What I personally do is not remove my hijab in front of men or women to avoid offending anyone and going through situations like this.", "The rules vary based on sect. Islam is not a monolith just like Christianity isn't a monolith. Catholicism isn't even a monolith.\n\nThe rules a person follows will be based on sect, the imam they follow, and the relationship with that imam.\n\nIf you want an example of the 10 commandments being treated differently look at Orthodox, Catholic, and many interpretations of protestants. \"I am thy lord they god, though shall have no other god before me.\" There are multiple protestant faiths that see the way Catholics interact with Mary and the saints as idolatry. Other protestants do not, while clearly Catholics do not. There are protestants that refer to Catholics as the cult of Mary because they don't view the rule the same way.\n\nObserve the sabbath and keep it holy? Orthodox Jews take that to me no work can be done that day with some taking it to mean they cannot flip light switches. There are practicing Jews that work on the sabbath and practicing Christians that work on the sabbath.\n\nIslam is a large religion with a lot of differences of opinion just like Judaism and Christianity. \n\nWe do not know what sect OP is a part of, or the unique interpretations OP's imam, like a priest or pastor, may take modesty to mean.", "I believe in following the beliefs. \n\nIf others don't follow to the same intensity that is up to them. I don't get to dictate how much someone believes. I'm not going to attack a Christian for failing to follow their dietary laws. Same with Jewish restrictions. It's up to them if they don't follow it but that doesn't make them not of that religion. \n\nIf OP wants to cover up for gay men, that is something the belief says to do. If she does not because she does not deem them haram then she does not need to cover. It is per her own judgment. \n\nWhen I practiced, I covered for everyone who was not family. A bit extreme but that was between me and God. Others do not follow as intensely. That is between them and God. They are not restricted to one or the other as that is just ignorant to people's free will. \n\nI do not get why you are arguing with my statements. It seems more to me that you do not like this religion and are upset about the rules that people follow for it.", "That's great if you were feeling opressed by the religion and broke free, that is perfectly amazing even!\n\nBut surely, being muslim yourself at some point, you've also met many people that do not follow the scripture exactly, while still being beliving and calling themselves muslim? \n\nI really don't see why it should be a problem to bend the religion to your will and use the name that most closely resembles what you believe, as it seems OP is doing?", "I think it's for OP to debate herself. However, for the sake of it, in mixed gender situations you are supposed to lower your gaze to avoid improper thoughts and you are supposed to dress modestly to help others do the same. \n\nModesty doesn't matter in single gender situations because that is not expected to be an issue. Having a gay person around changes things. If the point of modest dress is to help others lower their gaze, then sexuality is an important aspect to consider.", "bits and boobs !!", "THAT is how to combat stupid policies and show solidarity. Either no one can dress modestly, or everyone can", "I remember seeing that in the news. As a French teacher, it didn't surprised me in the slightest - France, the supposedly secular country where just about all of the public holidays are related to Catholic celebrations!", "Good for those nuns!  On my last beach vacation, I got pretty sunburned so I spent the rest of the time in floor-length sundresses and a scarf covering my upper body except my face. At first glance it could\u2019ve looked like someone wearing a hijab, except I clearly didn\u2019t know how to wear it or tie it. :-) Not all skin-covering is for modesty, not all modesty is religious, and not all religious modesty is Muslim. Pretty dumb to assume it is.", "I love this, nuns supporting Muslim women. Not in regards to modesty, but as a teenager I had a friend who tried to see if noise ordinance laws would be equally applied to classical music...yes the cop had a difficult time keeping straight face when asking them to turn down Beethoven's 9th....but he did and they did....", "This is so infuriating! Go topless, get harassed. Cover up in the wrong way, get harassed. Wetsuit? No problem. Burkini? Problem! Can't we just wear what we want without getting hassled? :(", "I was wondering about that- I am very fair-skinned and sometimes to avoid sunscreen (I get so sick of being sticky) I wear spf rash guards.

What does it mean to act on a tendency? You might have a tendency (to have certain feelings and urges) but it's not the tendency that you act (or don't act) on.\n\nWith that fixed then, I don't really see anything wrong with saying 'homosexual urges',   I don't think that's belittling it, or saying it's in any way fleeting or temporary (as a trait of the person) - I'm heterosexual and certainly have transient 'sexual urges' like anyone else, it doesn't mean I'm not heterosexual the rest of the time, when I'm not having sexual thoughts or feeling a particular urge or attraction to someone?", "Irrelevant to the argument", "As another queer person, I'm happy when cishet people stand up for us and bring attention to queerphobia. However... lots of people incorrectly identify it one way or the other. That frustrates me and probably most queer people. It frustrates me even more when those mistakes come from cishet people (because of how much more common they are from cishet people, the lack of understanding, etc.). \n\n\nIn this case, I'd say you're wrong. There was no offense in the MIL suggesting that a religious/cultural convention meant to prevent lustful male gaze upon women may not apply to gay men (and because the culture doesn't recognize homosexuality and assumes men inherently lust over women, gay men wouldn't be \"real men\" in that context). \n\n\nWhen conventionally feminine men (or gay men) are accused of not being real men, that is obviously shitty and offensive. In this case, the MIL was using that commonly understood bigotry against the bigots. In a \"well if I'm not a man in your eyes, then I should be able to marry men without issue\" kinda way. This person should not be forced to wear anything they don't want to and I don't think they're inherently bigoted for following Islamic customs, but MIL wasn't being queerphobic.", "Sorry I don't remember exactly what it was but I think it was an askreddit post about \"what are you supposed to care about but you just don't?\" or something to that effect. Many poeple answered \"pronouns\" which spurred further discussion.", "Bits and bobs covers all of that too", "I just felt like the wording was weird. The way people word things often reveals their hidden feelings on the matter. The fact that the person replied by trying to dodge instead of clarifying tells me a lot.\n\nEDIT: And it turns out that they're a devout Muslim so I was right.", "Sure, but they don't get the last word. When I see people spreading false information about homosexuality, I make sure to set things straight. Being gay isn't just about sex, it's also about the way you perceive and relate to people of the same sex.", "The person you're defending is a Muslim who believes exactly what they posted. So maybe you should put the lance away, this isn't a misunderstanding.\n\nHomophobes believe that being gay is just a perversion or a fetish, like people who get off on licking shoes. That's what \"homosexual tendencies\" is a dog whistle for. The truth is that being gay is just as natural, normal, beautiful, and innocent as being straight.", "It's relevant to the argument I'm having with you.", ">There was no offense in the MIL suggesting that a religious/cultural convention meant to prevent lustful male gaze upon women may not apply to gay men.\n\nThen both you and MIL are wrong, because it's not up to you to decide what does or doesn't apply to Islam.

She could as you said in the third paragraph \u201cusing bigotry against the bigots\u201d, as a gotcha moment to try to invalidate OP\u2019s reservations and religion, which I still think it is  wrong btw. I was holding on the phrase \u201cthey don\u2019t count as men\u201d and I didn\u2019t let it go, expecting some kind of underline malicious intent.", "I dunno, it feels like a lot of assuming that the people saying \"that's offensive\" are cishets, why do you assume that?", "I\u2019ll look for it, thank you!", "Yes but you can't act on that, it's like saying 'he shouldn't act on his effeminate', homophobic or not it just didn't make sense.\n\nAnd whether or not they hold the beliefs is irrelevant (well, if anything that they do qualifies them to explain it) to the discussion. If I say Nazi's coopted the swastika out of a belief that [whatever BS], it doesn't actually matter for the purpose of that discussion how I personally feel about Nazism or what my own views are, I'm just explaining those of a group, whether or not I belong to it.", "You're right! I didn't try to suggest otherwise. I'm simply arguing that the MIL's position isn't queerphobic. It's ignorant of Islam, sure.", "It's totally okay imo! You made a mistake with the intention of sticking up for queer people. I'm happy you went on to read all these responses and listen to queer people about it. \n\nI think I've just seen this same argument (the one the MIL espoused) in a lot of different places, on many many occasions. I've used that argument myself (in more appropriate contexts), there's logic to it. Absolutely passes my sniff test.", "I didn't. This person specifically said they're cishet in another comment (in this very thread, like a couple comments up...)."]}
