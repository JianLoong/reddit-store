{"id": 26710, "submission_id": "16gs1sh", "title": "AITA for asking for a dress code exception and ruining my relationship with my SIL?", "selftext": "I (F28) am a Muslim woman. I was not raised Muslim, but I converted during a difficult time in my life and I honestly believe it saved me.\n\nMy husband (M30) was there for me during this time, and has always understood my reasons and is very supportive despite being an atheist himself.\n\nMy husband's sister (F24) is getting married and asked me to be a bridesmaid, which I am thrilled to do. We have chosen a modest dress which I can wear with a hijab, and there are no qualms on that front.\n\nThe issue comes with her bachelorette party. She wants a Vegas themed party and all the girls must wear bikinis in coordinating colours. Now, I wouldn't mind this if I was just in the company of women, but I cannot show my body off in front of men, and two of the bridesmaids are my SIL's gay best friends (M24 and M25).\n\nThese two guys are lovely and I have absolutely no issue with them, but I cannot wear a bikini in front of them. I tried to compromise with my SIL and wear something modest but still in the colour scheme, but she says I am being homophobic and ruining the vibe of the party. She said if I can't wear a bikini, then I shouldn't bother being a bridesmaid at all.\n\nMy husband said I need to do whatever makes me feel comfortable, but my MIL (F62) is saying that I am driving a wedge in the family over nothing, and it isn't like I have never worn a bikini before and I can set aside my \"ideas\" for one night. She said that they don't count as men under the Muslim definition because they are gay and won't look at me \"like that\", and I am purposefully being difficult.\n\nMy SIL has followed through with uninviting me over this, and said she'll never be able to see me the same way again because of my selfish behaviour. So, I come to the internet to ask if I am being an AH?\n\nEdit to answer some questions:\n\n1. Will the men be wearing bikinis? No, they will be in Speedos.\n\n2. Will the party be in a public place? No, the bridesmaids have rented a private house with a pool area. As that is the case, I would have been happy to wear a bikini if a) there were only women in attendance, and b) I was not in any photos while wearing a bikini. I did discuss this with the bride.\n\n3. Given the haram theme, how can you attend? I understand that drinking, gambling, etc are all haram practices. While I do not partake in any of these myself, I cannot control what other people do and I was not involved in deciding the theme. \nI would have been happy to attend sober and not partake in haram activities, which the bride also knows about. While I can understand this may make me seem like a spoilsport, the bride had no issue with this. \nThe bride's only issue has consistently been that I am not wanting to wear a bikini despite the fact that her friends have no sexual interest in me.\n\n4. How is this different from there being men around that I can't marry (i.e. no need to cover myself)? I choose to veil and dress modestly because of my personal dedication to my religion. I will not put that aside because of some loophole that says that because they are gay, we could not get married.\n\n5. You are picking and choosing in your religion (not a question but a statement). Yes, I suppose that in some ways I am. I am a woman living in a Western country and I cannot live each day as if society around me were perfectly structured for my faith. I cover, I eat halal, I pray, and a number of other things, but sometimes we are thrown into unexpected situations and we need to adapt. That doesn't mean that I need to give up my faith, but I believe that Allah knows my intentions, and so long as I do my best to uphold the faith, then that is what I can do. In this case, I can still be involved in the festivities while being dressed modestly.\n\n6. How can you be married to an atheist? As I said in my post, I converted during a very difficult time in my life. At the same time, I was married to my husband. I understand that it is a sin to be married to someone who does not share my faith, but this man has been someone who has been my rock and has stood by me through thick and thin. While he may not be Muslim, he has a good heart and we love and need each other. There is much more at play here than a simple black and white, and I am not willing to either divorce him or force him to convert when he doesn't want to (which would be a horrible thing to do, and is also considered a sin). As much as I appreciate him being understanding and considerate of my faith, I owe it to him to show his religion (or lack thereof) the same consideration and respect.\n\n7. How can you be around these non-Muslim people, and people who are committing sin (i.e. drinking, gambling, etc)? I would like to unequivocally say that I have no issue with what other people do with their lives as long as they aren't hurting someone else. I am not here to force my religion or beliefs on anyone else, and I can have friends who have different beliefs. Please do not assume that I hate the other girls for choosing to dress immodestly, drink, and potentially gamble. In the same strain, I do not hate the gay men for being who they are. This post is not about me wanting to force others to change, this post is about me asking that I dress conservatively in line with my beliefs.\n\n8. Are you radicalised? I included this in my question and answer section more as a joke than anything, there are millions (if not billions) of Muslims around the world, and most of them are good, decent people. While I can acknowledge that there are some dark aspects associated with my religion, I do not have anything to do with that, and we must remember that people can corrupt anything to align with their own agenda. Please stop sending me hateful messages.\n\nI hope that answers everything! There are a lot of comments and it is difficult to see everything.", "created_utc": 1694526960, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16gs1sh/aita_for_asking_for_a_dress_code_exception_and/", "score": 5898, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Well, that sounds perfectly reasonable. You are NTA here. \n\n Bottom line, neither SIL nor MIL take your religious conversion seriously.

She has made an unreasonable demand. You are 100% right to refuse to humiliate yourself for her \"vision\" of her wedding and related events. Her reasons or expectations don't erase or reduce your right to choose to remain within your personal boundaries to protect your safety, privacy and comfort.\n\nA reasonable person would accept your choice of outfits, and let you bow out of an uncomfortable party.

It's good your husband is on your side on this, you don't have anything to feel bad about and I hope you won't do something you'd regret or that will make you uncomfortable for the sake of peace with relatives who are disrespecting you and manipulating you.

I wouldn\u2019t wear a typical bikini and I absolutely wouldn\u2019t be comfortable wearing one in front of people I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t care that they are gay, they are strangers and I\u2019m not comfortable. I wore less covering and more typical bikinis when I was younger and now I don\u2019t because I don\u2019t want to and that\u2019s that! \n\nThis always piss me off. People are so verbal when it comes to forcing people and particularly women to cover themselves but sometimes the very same people are perfectly fine with forcing women to *not* cover themselves. Occasionally we have wild debates about banning hijabs and \u201cMuslim\u201d bathing suits, thing is that in practice, what they want is just want to ban people from covering themselves. And I don\u2019t like it, never did. And I also happen to be personally affect by such suggested bans because despite not being Muslim I like covering bathing suits and I also happen to like to wrap a big scarf around my head to  keep warm in winter and to keep the sun away in summer. I have the red genes and I easily gets cold. I need to be able to cover myself as much as needed and wanted. And no one gets to tell me how to dress, do don\u2019t get to tell me to expose skin any more than you get to tell me to cover it. \n\nOh and calling OP homophobic is absolutely ridiculous! If anyone is being phobic it\u2019s the in-laws being islamophobic!", "Echo this.  I dress modestly as well.  No one gets to tell me I must expose my body in any way.  F@ck that noise.", "I am honestly a little anti-religious, but I don't feel comfortable in a bikini.  This is totally wrong of the bride.

I'm an atheist and I would refuse to wear a bikini to a party too.

I need a top with high neck plus shoulder coverage, and the bottoms are like 6\u201d inseam fitted gym shorts. I have a long sleeve top too. In addition, nobody else wants to see me in a bikini either. \n\nOP, have you looked at burkinis? I believe those can be made with UPF fabric for an added bonus.

And they will take photos- they will exist on their phones, they will upload them, show other people.  That would be a violation. A fellow Muslim woman would never dare show a photo of hijabi woman without a headscarf, but other people who aren't Muslim don't believe there is anything wrong with it, and wont feel the weight of the sin of doing that because they don't belive in wearing a hijab anyway or are not religious.\n\nI'd turn it round and tell them you've lost respect for them - they dont respect your body, your religion, that demanding you wear a bikini is like you demanding they wear a hijab and cover their body in your home or at your wedding.\n\nYour SIL is being islamaphobic, she is also anti-woman - as a fellow woman she should be about choice and not being forced and allowing someone to be comfortable in their own skin. If one of her friends was obese would she be forcing them too and then kicking them out if they refused, or if they were anorexic and had body dysmorphia and hated showing their body. And if someone didn't want to give any reason because its no one's business - then a woman has to accept the choice and free will of a woman who says no i am not comfortable dressed like this.\n\nYour husband sound like a wonderful man who has your back and totally respects you. I think its time you start getting upset about how they've disrespected you as a woman, as their sil/dil before you even get to the religious part. Also don't enter into discussions and technicalities they come up with, and who cares if you wore a bikini before - I have friends who wore them in their teens and early 20s and now feel too self conscious to  wear them as their bodies changed - its their choice, its their feelings, its their bodily autonomy.", "NTA at all. Nobody gets to coerce you into being undressed for them. Doesn't matter why you are uncomfortable.\nThem being gay doesn't change the fact they are men.

In front of women a womans awrah is collar bone area/chest to knees. The answer to the \"why\" part is simply bc Allah told us to. Muslims are subservient to Allah and Allah alone, so we do as we are instructed by the one we believe is the Creator. Islam encourages open discussion and questioning/gaining of knowledge, but I am not a scholar or anything just a simple Muslim so idk more in depth on the why aside from Allah said so \ud83d\ude05\n\nOf course for medical reasons/in emergencies etc you are allowed to show professionals areas to get treatment/help etc \n\nAs for lesbians its irrelevant, the ruling is about males/females, sexual orientation doesnt matter tbh.

Particularly with swimming even when applying and reapplying SPF 30+. I ADORE swimming. I could swim all day, everyday. But I rarely so because I don't want to get sunburned. Particularly since I've already had a malignant melanoma removed.\n\nSo when I heard about burkinis, I thought it was super cool. I assumed they would be pretty much wetsuits that cling and show EVERYTHING. Being very plus sized I thought \"Nope, that is NOT going to be flattering. In fact it will be the complete opposite. I'll look AWFUL\". Recently, I don't remember where, someone mentioned a company that makes burkinis.\n\nThough I would check it out. AMAZING! Pretty colors and designs, all different styles including mix and match and ones with skirts. SO excited! It won't be a big awful chore to go swimming. Don't have to worry about sunburn except hands, face and feet. Which are, by far, the easiest places to apply sunscreen and the least likely to miss spots.\n\nIt makes me SO angry the laws being passed about burkinis which are clearly meant to target specific women. Because it is not just Muslim women who would like to make use of these types of suits (not that it should matter one whit even if it was only Muslim women). There are quite a few religions that have strict dress restrictions I.e modesty which would not allow for swimming. These types of suits would allow women in these groups to be able to participate and enjoy swimming. It would open an opportunity that is currently not afforded to them.\n\nAnd there are so many non religious women like me who like them for our own reasons. Mine to prevent sunburn/skin cancer. Others may just wish to be more modest than a lot of current bathing suits. Some might have areas of their body they aren't comfortable with and would like to have it/them covered. Also like me, some may have scars they wish to cover to prevent stares, whispers, pointing and rude questions.\n\nThe major objection to the head covering part of the suit is literally the stupidest thing ever. ALL competitive swimmers cover their head with swim caps. A lot of people wear swim caps to keep chlorine from bleaching their hair (hello, orange hair) or to keep their hair dry. Heck, at my girl scout camp we were REQUIRED to wear white swim caps. We swam in a large river and the swim caps allowed the counselors to see us in the water and easily count to make sure we were all there. It used to be commonplace (looking at you Esther Williams).\n\nWhite women want to cover their hair and be more modest, fine and dandy. We even have pretty words for it, like demure and prim and proper. But let a woman of color or non Christian religion want the same, well then everyone better lose their goddamn minds. Fuck, I hate people.", "Okay as somebody who's lived in Las Vegas for more than a decade and a half, bikinis are only the norm for a certain subset of tourists, and then pretty much never after October.
