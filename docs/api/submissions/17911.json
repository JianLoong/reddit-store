ALSO since the router is mine, the wifi bill comes to me and then i just venmo request her every month. this month, she hasn\u2019t even paid for her portion the wifi, i never charged her. so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s paying for a service she isn\u2019t getting. but in any case, she is pissed at me and and i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve done anything unreasonable.

That way, there is no downtime once you leave.", "\"Let me let you keep the router so that you can have wifi that I pay for, but I'll be without it until you move out, what a wonderful idea!\" NTA OP because if she can't see she has other options then that's not your fault.", "NTA, it's yours, end of discussion.\n\nAlthough, there's one little thing i'd like to add: you could have put that router problem into focus earlier so she could have time to sort out a solution for herself. Something like \"oh, and since i'll take my router with me, obviously, make sure you have a follow-up solution afterwards\".\nSince, honestly, you only think about a router and wifi if it doesn't work. It is so normal to have wifi, we don't even think about it anymore.

Why should you leave it on for her when she's never paid you for it?", "NTA- I would just say- why would I leave MY router when I move so you can have the wifi that I paid for and I would have none? and then say. btw- that's a rhetorical question because the answer should be obvious.  When you want control of a router and wifi service- then you should pay for same and enjoy!", "NTA. Tell her she can speak with a service provider and get wifi at the current apt/house then transfer it to the new apt/house.", "NTA.

Hmm... will your friend need a new router anyway for her new digs?  In any case, there's one router (which is yours) and two households.  There's no Solomonic solution here.
