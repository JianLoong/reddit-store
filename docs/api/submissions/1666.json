My Mum has been with her partner for 15 years. It was never clear whether they were ever going to get married due to other family dynamics. They are both divorced. \n\nMy step-father very casually proposed to my Mum by simply mentioning to her in early 2021. They didn't start to move forward with any plans right away. \n\nWhen I got engaged later last year my fiance took me ring shopping. I was sending my mum possible pictures but we eventually went for a bespoke ring. My Mum then went engagement ring shopping the next week for hers and only told me about it on the day. She got a more generic (but likely still more expensive) ring which meant she got hers only a week later. Since mine was being made from scratch I didn't get mine until several months later. Myself and my fiance found this slightly distressing at the time because it was odd for her to get hers the exact same time I was looking for mine and then a bit of a let down for her to then get hers first. We did not say anything though. \n\nIn the year that has passed she has not made any wedding plans of her own. I have been planning mine a lot. \n\nI had told her that my fiance and I had been looking at wedding rings the last couple weekends. I also sent her some potential pictures of ideas I had. When I asked her how her weekend was she said she and her Fiance had bought their wedding rings this weekend. \n\nWe were shocked that they had deliberately bought rings right when I had told her we were looking at rings for a 2nd time. My fiance says that I need to tell my Mum that she is not allowed to get married 2-3 months either side of our wedding. He is worried that since she keeps copying me that she will do this again with the actual wedding. I agree, but I know that I can't control what they do and I otherwise have a very close relationship with my Mum. I think she has just done these things thoughtlessly rather than maliciously. \n\nSo WIBTA if I asked her not to get married close to my wedding?\n\nEdit: People make a fair point about maybe 2-3 months being too long. Also I probably would ask instead of tell, if I decide to say anything.\n\nMaybe I should have included this info but to be honest I hadn't even thought about why we don't want them to get married close to us:\nDue to the aforementioned family dynamics, some other family members don't want them to get married. So when they do, it will no doubt cause sulking and rifts for at least a few weeks with other family members.

Do you hear yourself? Get a grip! Of course YWBTA! Tell your fianc\u00e9 to get a grip too!", "YWBTA. Funny fact: your exact wedding date already belongs to someone. A lot of people actually. About 6200 ppl per day.  You're calling dibs on a span of time that 1.1 million people will also be using already anyway. Not to mention people who married in those days prior. \n\nMy 2 cousins and myself are all marrying September next year. If it's all the same week who cares? That has nothing to do with my marriage at all.", "YWBTA you get one mother fucking day for your wedding. You don\u2019t get to claim weeks or months for a one day event. I\u2019m utterly sick of people acting like their wedding is the event of everyone\u2019s lifetime. It\u2019s the event of YOUR lifetime and as whole no one really cares about you getting married, it\u2019s just one more social obligation people who care about you are obligated to participate in.", "YTA. Why on earth should this matter to you?", "YWBTA\n\nYou don\u2019t get to dictate when your mother or anyone else gets married.\n\nYou could solve your current problem pretty easily. It is not necessary to tell your mommy everything you do.", "Yta. Also maybe she\u2019s not trying to compete maybe she\u2019s trying to get excited about it with you! And maybe been inspired by you.  \n\nMy cousin and my brother both got married the same year as me. Sometimes things fall that way.\n\nOur weddings were all completely different but all good, we all messaged and shared things, and even helped each other with recommendations etc\u2026\n\nPeople just like seeing the happy couple happy with their day.\n\nSorry to break it to you but no one cares about your wedding as much as you do! \n\nThe ring thing sounds ridiculous, you got your dream ring right?

Limit what you share!", "YWBTA. 2-3 months? how would that impact your wedding? How does that take away from anything you're doing?If it were a week or two before your wedding, I'd think \"yeah that seems a little malicious\"- but 3 months? come on. Your mom, like you, should have her wedding she wants, but you can't gatekeep a whole quarter of the year. \n\nMaybe her intention is not to copy; maybe she saw your excitement about your ring/wedding and it made her realize she can be excited for herself and her own nuptials too.", "Sorry but Ywbta.\n\nThere is a certain \"season\" where weddings tend to happen (June ish).\n\nIf your mother getting married takes away from your wedding,  that speaks more to either\nA) your own insecurities  or\nB) Some other issue with your mother or her fiance\n\n\nLet this go.", "YWBTA. Why not phrase it more nicely? Like ask her for her date and then choose yours? Or say hey let's not pick dates too close together so we can help each other and have breathing room?", "YTA 2-3 months of your wedding is ridiculous, try a few wheels. And it sounds like your mom just doesn\u2019t know what to be doing and your reminding her as you do yours. Those are all normal things for her to be doing. Selfish and  Reeking of jealousy. Why does it matter?", "Question, what would be the problem with her getting married 2 months after you? Like I would get it if she planned it on the same day in an effort to take the attention away from you. But a 2-3 month window on either side of your wedding is basically telling your mom that she is not allowed to get married for an entire half of a year. For now I think YWBTA", "YTA.\n\nYour mum can get married whenever she wants to. You do not get to dictate when she buys rings or anything else. Her getting married 2-3 months before or after your wedding will have no impact on your wedding.", "Yeah YTA\n\nJust because youre getting married, doesnt mean your Mom cant choose to get married also. And to call 'dibs' on 2 - 3 months either side of your wedding day is childish and ridiculous. The world doesnt revolve around you.\n\nBe happy for your Mom, as Im sure she is for you.", "Ywbta for trying to dictate when her wedding is. You and your fiance are making assumptions. While she may be \"copying\" you,  you have no proof it's not coincidence. I suggest you relax and focus on your wedding", "YWBTA - Is the timing a little odd? Sure. But you don\u2019t own the concept of getting married or the timelines. Focus on your own plans and stop stressing over hers.", "YTA. You should be happy for your mom who is *finally* getting married after *15 years*. Instead you seem disgusted. You and your fianc\u00e9 are both shallow, ignorant, selfish people.", "YTA. If controlling what someone else does about their relationship will somehow make your wedding more special to you\u2026 rethink this major life decision.", "What makes your fiance think you or anyone else can control when someone else chooses to get married?", "YTA\n\nyou don\u2019t own timing. You can\u2019t tell her when to do what.", "Info: Why do you care when your mother gets married? Exactly what effect does it have on you or your wedding?", "I fail to see the connection.\n\nMaybe you showing rings reminded your mom and her fiance of what they don't have. It's not like they bought the exact same rings.\n\nUnless she plans to crash your wedding with hers, you shouldn't care when she will get married. \n\nYTA", "You would absolutely be TA if you tried to control another person's wedding, yes.\n\nWould it be peculiar for her to choose to remarry so close to your wedding? Sure, but everyone wants a summer wedding and 3 months is litteraly the longest they can push it without waiting an extra year, which for most people is at least 1%of their whole life!", "Yta....just remember the more you tell someone NOT to do something or ask them not to it will be an issue. So ignore her life that you have no business trying to control and stay in your lane and worry about you and your life affairs.", "YTA.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.\n\nStop telling her stuff - that much is obvious.  As for your 'requirement' about timing you are being ridiculous.   How many times do you wedding people have to be told - precisely no one cares about your wedding as much as you do.  For the rest of us, we show up on the day, have a time (note, I did not specify 'nice' necessarily LOL), and then we leave.  The next day, we forget about most of it.  Even the bride/groom party aren't spending too much time worrying about it. \n\nObviously she is going to know the date as you have sent invitations, or are going to, so you can't control anything at this point.  Since she has one-upped you multiple times already, don't be surprised when they (a) have their wedding the week before you, or (b) have a surprise wedding at your wedding.  \n\nI really hope that isn't a thing..........can't wait for that post........", "I\u2019d have to say YWBTA. Although it sounds like your mom is trying to compete with you, you can\u2019t gatekeep any date after your wedding. As long as it\u2019s not a couple weeks before or a few days before, I think they\u2019re in the clear. Though it seems weird that your mom and her fianc\u00e9 suddenly care about getting married right after you were proposed to.", "Yea you will be. Who cares if she does?", "YTH You literally cant control when they get married the only people who can do that is them. Its super rude to even consider intruding on their happiness because you are worried yours will be ruined thats selfish and paranoid.", "YWBTA. It's ok to ask that another family event doesn't conflict with your wedding day. Maybe you could ask that it not conflict with the weekend. But 2-3 months before and after? The royals don't even do that.", "YTA, what's wrong with her getting married 2 months after you? People can't stop their lives because you are getting married. You remind me of another post where the bride didn't want anyone getting married the same year as her. \nPeople do get marriage fever when people close to them get married, same goes with pregnancy.", "YWBTA - that\u2019s not something you get to control or even have a say in. I can see being upset about a same weekend wedding but your request would be ridiculous.", "YTA, and your fiance too. You don't own a date and your mother can get married when she pleases. I would understand if she mentioned getting married the next or previous week from your date but she hasn't. 2-3 months is excessive and I blame your fiance for that frankly, I only voted YTA because YWBTA doesn't register", "NAH- I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to have a discussion about wedding dates with her and explain that you would like to keep them about two months apart. My thought is, if you are flexible with yours the conversation would be beneficial. \n\nOn a personal note, I\u2019ve been where you are and it sucks. My mom and step dad (who I love very much) decided to get married the same year as me after being together for 15 years. I kept asking why now and couldn\u2019t get an answer. I don\u2019t think it was a competition thing, but I think the fact that her only child was getting married triggered something in her that made her feel weird not to be married. I\u2019m reading everyone saying you can\u2019t control others, other people will have your wedding date, etc and thinking it\u2019s a unique situation they just don\u2019t get. Most women are excited to share their wedding planning with their moms and it\u2019s disheartening to be excited to share something like we picked out our rings and hear \u201coh we did that too\u201d  like yeah big whoop, so did we over and over again. \n\nI see some people have gone to the classic thought that all brides just want the attention all on them, but are seeming to forget that there is a whole range of emotions this could be bringing up for you. Message me if you want to an ear to listen.", "YTA. Your mom can get married whenever she wants.", "I say NTA. Maybe not quite phrased that way but it does seem like there\u2019s a weird competitive vibe happening here and it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to at least say something like \u2018hey we\u2019re thinking of this date but want to make sure our weddings aren\u2019t too close.  Can we coordinate this?  What dates are you looking at?\u2019", "NAH. She\u2019s probably just inspired by you and realizes she/they wants similar things. Will they even have a wedding that people would be invited to? That said, I would be worried too you\u2019ll set a date and then she\u2019ll set hers (or go to the courthouse or Vegas) like 1 week prior or something that makes it weird, and then use your wedding to announce her news and share her stories. So I think you\u2019re wise to set your date and then ask her to not have her date at least 2 months before as you want her available to you for all the mother-of-the-bride tasks and such.", "It's possible that your fianc\u00e9 proposing simply spurred your step-father to do the same. I would be quite surprised if your mother tries to have her wedding particularly close to yours anyways.", "You wouldn\u2019t be TA if you asked, but you would be if you demanded.", "NAH, just have a conversation with her, to make sure that both couples are feeling happy with how plans are going.  This doesn't need to be a big dramatic conflict, just talk over how you both are feeling about wedding plans.", "YWBTA", "Info, why don't your family want them to get married?", "NTA.  But if you\u2019re concerned, give a fake date and venue.  See if she books the general time and location.  If she does, tell her YOU changed your mind and chose an alternative so you can both be special.", "I get how you are feeling, it's weird that you get engaged and she gets engaged. You order a ring she buys a ring. You look at wedding rings, she buys a wedding ring.\n\n\nI would announce a fake date and see what happens. Then after she commits to a venue etc you can announce your real date.\n\n\nThe reason most people don't want weddings too close to another family members is the expense. If people are traveling or have to take time off, they need time to budget the expense.  Also mom and daughter being available to help without trying to plan a separate event is really helpful", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t see a big problem here. I\u2019ve known a few older couples who got engaged later in life. They tend to be way more laidback about wedding planning than people in their 20s and 30s. Especially if they\u2019ve been together a long time and you said yourself the proposal was very casual. It\u2019s possible that what\u2019s happening is your mom is seeing your messages and using them as reminders of stuff she needs to do now she\u2019s engaged.
