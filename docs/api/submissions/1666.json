{"id": 1666, "submission_id": "yo7vk5", "title": "WIBTA for telling my Mum she can't get married within 2-3 months of my wedding?", "selftext": "Myself and my Fiance got engaged last year and are getting married this spring. My Mum has been with her partner for 15 years. It was never clear whether they were ever going to get married due to other family dynamics. They are both divorced. \n\nMy step-father very casually proposed to my Mum by simply mentioning to her in early 2021. They didn't start to move forward with any plans right away. \n\nWhen I got engaged later last year my fiance took me ring shopping. I was sending my mum possible pictures but we eventually went for a bespoke ring. My Mum then went engagement ring shopping the next week for hers and only told me about it on the day. She got a more generic (but likely still more expensive) ring which meant she got hers only a week later. Since mine was being made from scratch I didn't get mine until several months later. Myself and my fiance found this slightly distressing at the time because it was odd for her to get hers the exact same time I was looking for mine and then a bit of a let down for her to then get hers first. We did not say anything though. \n\nIn the year that has passed she has not made any wedding plans of her own. I have been planning mine a lot. \n\nI had told her that my fiance and I had been looking at wedding rings the last couple weekends. I also sent her some potential pictures of ideas I had. When I asked her how her weekend was she said she and her Fiance had bought their wedding rings this weekend. \n\nWe were shocked that they had deliberately bought rings right when I had told her we were looking at rings for a 2nd time. My fiance says that I need to tell my Mum that she is not allowed to get married 2-3 months either side of our wedding. He is worried that since she keeps copying me that she will do this again with the actual wedding. I agree, but I know that I can't control what they do and I otherwise have a very close relationship with my Mum. I think she has just done these things thoughtlessly rather than maliciously. \n\nSo WIBTA if I asked her not to get married close to my wedding?\n\nEdit: People make a fair point about maybe 2-3 months being too long. Also I probably would ask instead of tell, if I decide to say anything.\n\nMaybe I should have included this info but to be honest I hadn't even thought about why we don't want them to get married close to us:\nDue to the aforementioned family dynamics, some other family members don't want them to get married. So when they do, it will no doubt cause sulking and rifts for at least a few weeks with other family members. I really want everyone to just be getting along for my wedding.\n\nUpdate: \nThank you for your votes. I think I will simply ask her when she is thinking of getting married. I know I can't control what she does and I don't own the dates, but I don't think that should stop me asking her if she would consider avoiding around my date more as a favour. She has made other weird comments like joking about borrowing my wedding dress so there are other things that make me uncomfortable. She has spoken about just going to the registrar office and having a meal out afterwards so it is the sort of thing that could be planned short notice, that's why I'm worried she might do it on the spur of the moment very close to mine. For anyone saying to give a fake wedding date - I know some people plan weddings in 6 months but most are planned at least a year in advance nowadays. We sent out save the dates in September. So this suggestion wouldn't work and also lying to her to try to manipulate her into avoiding my date seems like an even worse thing to do than openly discussing my feelings with her.", "created_utc": 1667781574, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yo7vk5/wibta_for_telling_my_mum_she_cant_get_married/", "score": 331, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you hear yourself? Get a grip! Of course YWBTA! Tell your fianc\u00e9 to get a grip too!", "YWBTA. Funny fact: your exact wedding date already belongs to someone. A lot of people actually. About 6200 ppl per day.  You're calling dibs on a span of time that 1.1 million people will also be using already anyway. Not to mention people who married in those days prior. \n\nMy 2 cousins and myself are all marrying September next year. If it's all the same week who cares? That has nothing to do with my marriage at all.", "YWBTA you get one mother fucking day for your wedding. You don\u2019t get to claim weeks or months for a one day event. I\u2019m utterly sick of people acting like their wedding is the event of everyone\u2019s lifetime. It\u2019s the event of YOUR lifetime and as whole no one really cares about you getting married, it\u2019s just one more social obligation people who care about you are obligated to participate in.", "YTA. Why on earth should this matter to you?", "YWBTA\n\nYou don\u2019t get to dictate when your mother or anyone else gets married.\n\nYou could solve your current problem pretty easily. It is not necessary to tell your mommy everything you do.", "Yta. Also maybe she\u2019s not trying to compete maybe she\u2019s trying to get excited about it with you! And maybe been inspired by you.  \n\nMy cousin and my brother both got married the same year as me. Sometimes things fall that way.\n\nOur weddings were all completely different but all good, we all messaged and shared things, and even helped each other with recommendations etc\u2026\n\nPeople just like seeing the happy couple happy with their day.\n\nSorry to break it to you but no one cares about your wedding as much as you do! \n\nThe ring thing sounds ridiculous, you got your dream ring right?

How does that take away from anything you're doing?If it were a week or two before your wedding, I'd think \"yeah that seems a little malicious\"- but 3 months? come on. Your mom, like you, should have her wedding she wants, but you can't gatekeep a whole quarter of the year. \n\nMaybe her intention is not to copy; maybe she saw your excitement about your ring/wedding and it made her realize she can be excited for herself and her own nuptials too.", "Sorry but Ywbta.\n\nThere is a certain \"season\" where weddings tend to happen (June ish).\n\nIf your mother getting married takes away from your wedding,  that speaks more to either\nA) your own insecurities  or\nB) Some other issue with your mother or her fiance\n\n\nLet this go.", "YWBTA. Why not phrase it more nicely? Like ask her for her date and then choose yours? Or say hey let's not pick dates too close together so we can help each other and have breathing room?", "YTA 2-3 months of your wedding is ridiculous, try a few weeks. And it sounds like your mom just doesn\u2019t know what to be doing and your reminding her as you do yours. Those are all normal things for her to be doing. Selfish and  Reeking of jealousy. Why does it matter?", "Question, what would be the problem with her getting married 2 months after you? Like I would get it if she planned it on the same day in an effort to take the attention away from you. But a 2-3 month window on either side of your wedding is basically telling your mom that she is not allowed to get married for an entire half of a year. For now I think YWBTA", "YTA.\n\nYour mum can get married whenever she wants to. You do not get to dictate when she buys rings or anything else. Her getting married 2-3 months before or after your wedding will have no impact on your wedding.", "Yeah YTA\n\nJust because youre getting married, doesnt mean your Mom cant choose to get married also. And to call 'dibs' on 2 - 3 months either side of your wedding day is childish and ridiculous. The world doesnt revolve around you.\n\nBe happy for your Mom, as Im sure she is for you.", "Ywbta for trying to dictate when her wedding is. You and your fiance are making assumptions. While she may be \"copying\" you,  you have no proof it's not coincidence. I suggest you relax and focus on your wedding", "YWBTA - Is the timing a little odd? Sure. But you don\u2019t own the concept of getting married or the timelines. Focus on your own plans and stop stressing over hers.", "YTA. You should be happy for your mom who is *finally* getting married after *15 years*. Instead you seem disgusted. You and your fianc\u00e9 are both shallow, ignorant, selfish people.", "YTA. If controlling what someone else does about their relationship will somehow make your wedding more special to you\u2026 rethink this major life decision.", "What makes your fiance think you or anyone else can control when someone else chooses to get married?", "YTA\n\nyou don\u2019t own timing.

Exactly what effect does it have on you or your wedding?", "I fail to see the connection.\n\nMaybe you showing rings reminded your mom and her fiance of what they don't have. It's not like they bought the exact same rings.\n\nUnless she plans to crash your wedding with hers, you shouldn't care when she will get married. \n\nYTA", "You would absolutely be TA if you tried to control another person's wedding, yes.\n\nWould it be peculiar for her to choose to remarry so close to your wedding? Sure, but everyone wants a summer wedding and 3 months is litteraly the longest they can push it without waiting an extra year, which for most people is at least 1%of their whole life!", "Yta....just remember the more you tell someone NOT to do something or ask them not to it will be an issue. So ignore her life that you have no business trying to control and stay in your lane and worry about you and your life affairs.", "YTA.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.\n\nStop telling her stuff - that much is obvious.  As for your 'requirement' about timing you are being ridiculous.   How many times do you wedding people have to be told - precisely no one cares about your wedding as much as you do.  For the rest of us, we show up on the day, have a time (note, I did not specify 'nice' necessarily LOL), and then we leave.  The next day, we forget about most of it.  Even the bride/groom party aren't spending too much time worrying about it. \n\nObviously she is going to know the date as you have sent invitations, or are going to, so you can't control anything at this point.  Since she has one-upped you multiple times already, don't be surprised when they (a) have their wedding the week before you, or (b) have a surprise wedding at your wedding.  \n\nI really hope that isn't a thing..........can't wait for that post........", "I\u2019d have to say YWBTA. Although it sounds like your mom is trying to compete with you, you can\u2019t gatekeep any date after your wedding. As long as it\u2019s not a couple weeks before or a few days before, I think they\u2019re in the clear. Though it seems weird that your mom and her fianc\u00e9 suddenly care about getting married right after you were proposed to.", "Yea you will be. Who cares if she does?", "YTH You literally cant control when they get married the only people who can do that is them. Its super rude to even consider intruding on their happiness because you are worried yours will be ruined thats selfish and paranoid.", "YWBTA. It's ok to ask that another family event doesn't conflict with your wedding day. Maybe you could ask that it not conflict with the weekend. But 2-3 months before and after? The royals don't even do that.", "YTA, what's wrong with her getting married 2 months after you? People can't stop their lives because you are getting married. You remind me of another post where the bride didn't want anyone getting married the same year as her. \nPeople do get marriage fever when people close to them get married, same goes with pregnancy.", "YWBTA - that\u2019s not something you get to control or even have a say in. I can see being upset about a same weekend wedding but your request would be ridiculous.", "YTA, and your fiance too. You don't own a date and your mother can get married when she pleases. I would understand if she mentioned getting married the next or previous week from your date but she hasn't. 2-3 months is excessive and I blame your fiance for that frankly, I only voted YTA because YWBTA doesn't register", "NAH- I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to have a discussion about wedding dates with her and explain that you would like to keep them about two months apart. My thought is, if you are flexible with yours the conversation would be beneficial. \n\nOn a personal note, I\u2019ve been where you are and it sucks. My mom and step dad (who I love very much) decided to get married the same year as me after being together for 15 years. I kept asking why now and couldn\u2019t get an answer. I don\u2019t think it was a competition thing, but I think the fact that her only child was getting married triggered something in her that made her feel weird not to be married. I\u2019m reading everyone saying you can\u2019t control others, other people will have your wedding date, etc and thinking it\u2019s a unique situation they just don\u2019t get. Most women are excited to share their wedding planning with their moms and it\u2019s disheartening to be excited to share something like we picked out our rings and hear \u201coh we did that too\u201d  like yeah big whoop, so did we over and over again. \n\nI see some people have gone to the classic thought that all brides just want the attention all on them, but are seeming to forget that there is a whole range of emotions this could be bringing up for you. Message me if you want to an ear to listen.", "YTA. Your mom can get married whenever she wants.", "I say NTA. Maybe not quite phrased that way but it does seem like there\u2019s a weird competitive vibe happening here and it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to at least say something like \u2018hey we\u2019re thinking of this date but want to make sure our weddings aren\u2019t too close.  Can we coordinate this?  What dates are you looking at?\u2019", "NAH. She\u2019s probably just inspired by you and realizes she/they wants similar things. Will they even have a wedding that people would be invited to? That said, I would be worried too you\u2019ll set a date and then she\u2019ll set hers (or go to the courthouse or Vegas) like 1 week prior or something that makes it weird, and then use your wedding to announce her news and share her stories. So I think you\u2019re wise to set your date and then ask her to not have her date at least 2 months before as you want her available to you for all the mother-of-the-bride tasks and such.", "It's possible that your fianc\u00e9 proposing simply spurred your step-father to do the same. I would be quite surprised if your mother tries to have her wedding particularly close to yours anyways.", "You wouldn\u2019t be TA if you asked, but you would be if you demanded.", "NAH, just have a conversation with her, to make sure that both couples are feeling happy with how plans are going.  This doesn't need to be a big dramatic conflict, just talk over how you both are feeling about wedding plans.", "YWBTA", "Info, why don't your family want them to get married?", "NTA.  But if you\u2019re concerned, give a fake date and venue.  See if she books the general time and location.  If she does, tell her YOU changed your mind and chose an alternative so you can both be special.", "I get how you are feeling, it's weird that you get engaged and she gets engaged. You order a ring she buys a ring. You look at wedding rings, she buys a wedding ring.\n\n\nI would announce a fake date and see what happens. Then after she commits to a venue etc you can announce your real date.\n\n\nThe reason most people don't want weddings too close to another family members is the expense. If people are traveling or have to take time off, they need time to budget the expense.  Also mom and daughter being available to help without trying to plan a separate event is really helpful", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My mum got married for a third time, when we were dress shopping for me she was looking too and wasn't even engaged yet. Fast forward we were looking at a destination wedding and she kept making jokes about double wedding.... Other stuff too like she lost her original engagement ring and replaced it with something more similar to mine. It was a lot.... I'd advise an information diet for your Mum and I'd be telling her 3 month clearance on a wedding date. You don't need the angst", "This is so well said!!", "To be fair, we're eloping. None of that matters. Dunno about one cousin but the other is doing a whole thing. \n\nAnyway my point is who cares if her mom wants to get married a few months near her day?  Weddings have a tendancy to lull people into this feeling of a need for the image of your special day when it's supposed to be about your marriage. I get what OP is saying, but blocking off 6 months of the year to ensure your mother doesn't grab attention from your nuptials? Look, idk if she's copying her daughter on purpose or if it's just that she needed a push or something to deal with her own relationship, but as long as she doesn't show up to OPs day in white, drunk, or belligerent, then moms choices really have no bearing on OPs wedding at all.", "Hmmm but what about after 15 years together he finally proposes and then your daughter decides that she's going to get engaged in the same year and then gets mad that you have similar ring shopping times?\n\nCurrently according to op mum is thinking registry office wedding so all this is actually about op competing against mum and not the other way around. Her only justification is that her family members might be sulky that mum and stepdad are getting married at all because even though they have been together for 15 years they disapprove and will somehow ruin OPs wedding cause they made it legal. OP and fiance are being self centred at the very least.", "I\u2019m sorry but you can\u2019t go around barking out orders about when someone else get married\u2026 despite what others think.. it\u2019s not a exclusive you and you only day.. all kinds of people get married on \u201cyour special day\u201d. Asking someone to get married 3 to 6 months out either way from your own wedding because it could cause tension at your wedding is literally insane. \n\nIt sounds like a very weird situation to me. I\u2019m not understanding the whole.. she got rings before ME and this and that before ME concept. \n\nGod forbid someone do something close to the timeframe that OP did. \n\nI respectfully disagree with you. \n\nOp YTA", "But DURING the shopping and fitting process? I can see after, but during? That's kind of weird", "Wtf?? Majorly, YTA. \n\nHow selfish and entitled can one person be? You should be happy for your mother. You're just thinking about yourself. Fucking disgusting.", "Omg who cares if they get married close to your date? Who cares if she copies everything you do?  No one. Zero people. You bring attention to it by caring. YTA.", "If I\u2019m reading this correctly you and your mom both got engaged last year in 2021, it comes off as the mom was engaged FIRST. You downplayed her engagement like it doesn\u2019t matter because the way she was proposed to. \n\nNext you mention your jealousy over her getting a ring before you. You guys both got engaged in the same year of course she would get a ring around the same time.\n\nLastly you mentioned talking to her and telling her you were shopping for rings. Then in what sounds like the same conversation asked her what she\u2019d been up to. She replied that she had already bought a ring that weekend. You literally had just told her you were shopping and she told you she\u2019d already bought hers. She didn\u2019t copy you.\n\nMy question is why are you so jealous of your mom?You get one day. Not an entire year. YTA let your mom be happy and stop making everything about you.", "YTA it sounds like you have issues with your mom that go beyond this because there is nothing wrong in my eyes with how they went about wedding ring shopping. 2-3 months on either end seems excessive as hell. Have a chat with her and say \u201cdo you have an idea what day you\u2019re doing? Let\u2019s coordinate, maybe so there\u2019s AT LEAST two weeks between them? I don\u2019t like the idea of doing them back to back\u201d. I honestly think you\u2019ve just set a lot of expectations for yourself about what this time of your life will be like and I\u2019m sure you just didn\u2019t imagine your mom going through the same thing. It\u2019s okay to acknowledge those feelings \u2764\ufe0f", "It seems to me you will only have problems if she marries BEFORE you do. She probably knows the family dynamics as well as you do. So ask her to marry after you do", "Yes, YWBTA. Your mother can get married whenever she damn well pleases. The only date you have any \"right\" to request she not use is the day of your own wedding, assuming you already have a venue booked for that date.", "You seem to think you\u2019re being wrongly imposed upon. You\u2019re not. \n\nMany years ago, a couple of days before my stepsister\u2019s wedding, her mom (my stepfather\u2019s ex) announced she was getting married \u2026 the night before stepsister\u2019s wedding. So basically, the rehearsal dinner for stepsister was usurped by her mom\u2019s wedding. That\u2019s what I call an imposition. \n\nYTA", "YWBTA. Why do you care about any of these things?", "YTA. LOL. I have a cousin whose son and daughter got married within a couple weeks of each other this past summer. I had to check the Facebook feeds a couple times to make sure I saw it right. Both looked to be smaller affairs and everyone looked like they were having a fabulous time.", "I have seen enough posts and stuff about Moms doing odd stuff like stealing their daughter\u2019s wedding day by wearing a wedding dress or trying to renew their vows right after the ceremony that I take posts like this with a grain of salt. Also, and I try to say this gently, you do not own any dates nor is it your place/right to ask her to change her current wedding plans. The best course of action in my opinion is to simply talk, to ask her when she plans to get married and maybe even help her plan if you\u2019re worried about it being too similar to yours.", "She is jealous and spiteful. I'd put her on an information diet.\n\nI'll add my ESH so it's before the next sentence, but,  \nSoft YWBTA for asking for several months buffer on either side of your wedding day, sorry...", "As someone with a mother who has a bad habit of acting like a narcissist, I can see where you\u2019re concerned. Stealing a child\u2019s thunder during life events is 100% a common move for her. I got married, she threw herself a pity party because it was windy and her hair got messed up, a pity party because everyone else had a date and looked happy (my dad, her husband of 30 years, passed 3 years ago, wound is fresh for her, she\u2019s having a very hard time coping, but I was literally dancing on my wedding night and got pulled aside by my cousin so I could attend to my distraught mother), threw a pity party because the day after the wedding we didn\u2019t spend the whole day together (married in Mexico, spent the day in the pool relaxing where anyone could\u2019ve joined us) and threw a pity party because I spent \u201cmore time\u201d with my wife\u2019s parents that weekend (they joined us at the pool). \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. If your mom is like mine, you\u2019re worried she\u2019s going to steal your thunder, it\u2019s understandable. Right now, NAH, if you get pushy about timing, you\u2019d be the asshole, if she decides to get hitched with a few weeks of yours and the family dynamic changes for your wedding, she\u2019s the ass hole. \n\nHeads up though, if she\u2019s like my mom, she\u2019s gonna win this one. If she decides to steal your thunder, just smile and nod, don\u2019t give her the satisfaction. The most important people will 100% be celebrating you, and only you and your partner, on your wedding day.", "NAH\n\nI so see your point. It happened to me. \n\nThere was no weddings for years in my family. I planned mine for over a year. All of a suddent, the same summer/fall, my mom gets remaried. Then, my dad wants his cake too, so he remarries (to his AP). Then my cousin, who was super vocal about never getting married, gets married whitin short notice. As in it was not even planned during my wedding and he got married shortly after. All of that in about a 4-5 months span. \n\nThere was no wedding for almost a decade after that. \n\nSo yeah, it kinda felt they all stole my thunder. I was the only one from that lot who actually wanted to get married in the first place. Mom did it for practicals, dad did it out of spite and cousin did it out of jealousy. None of them were planning to get wed until I got married myself.\n\nIt\u2019s been 20 years, so I don\u2019t think about it all that much now.", "She did get engaged first, but then made no progress for 6 months until I got engaged. Both times with the rings, I had told her we went shopping one weekend then the next weekend she went shopping for rings.", "I think that's the question.  Are they going super low key, or are they going average size because it's the groom's first wedding?  My niece, parents and I were the only ones who went to my brother's second wedding.  The bride only had her Mom and Stepdad, two kids and a very close friend and their +1.  Had I been having a first wedding around the same time, that wouldn't have stolen my thunder at all.", "Ok, but that cant be the only reason or you wouldnt be getting so whiny about your mom doing all the normal stuff people do before getting married. You sound incredibly self centered. It bothered  you that two people who are getting married bought rings to get married. Your mom's fiancee buying her an engagement ring is \"copying you\". You're not the center of the universe, you don't get to tell people when they can buy things, propose, or get married. Unless she's getting married on the exact same day (or *maybe* weekend) as you then you need to grow up and not mention it.", "So you think your mom has a problem going to your wedding unmarried when she was engaged before you? That makes absolutely no sense.", "Maybe they just went \"shoot, we still haven't bought an engagement ring yet\"?  But it seems like something else is going on with her emotionally if she's joking about borrowing your dress.", "I am shocked. Shocked, I yell you!", "Exactly!", "No because OP didn\u2019t propose to herself did she?", "Most couples these days tend to make those decisions together, in my experience anyway.", "She got engaged nearly a year later your point is still not relevant\u2026."]}
