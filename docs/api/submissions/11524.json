Please ask for clarity if required.\n\nMy spouse (38F) and I (39M) are having a parenting disagreement when it comes to teaching the kids how to use utensils. The eldest (12 and 10) are biological children of my spouse and we have one child together. I have been in the lives of the eldest children for 7 years and they are shared between our house and their father\u2019s house equally. We are all right handed.\n\nMy spouse and I are of the same race and culture, though I would say that my parents had higher expectations as far as chores, manners, school work, etc. This isn\u2019t a shot at anyone. My spouse would agree, and has.\n\nWhen dining, the eldest child just happens to sit next to me, and as a result I have had the opportunity to teach them how to use dining utensils (especially a knife and fork) the way that I was shown to do it, and how I see most people do it.\n\nFor reference I\u2019m referring to holding a fork in your left hand and using it with the tines pointing downward to hold whatever the item is to be cut, while using the right hand to hold the knife and cut the item as required using a back-and-forth sawing motion. When eating something that does not require cutting, I would use the fork in my right hand.\n\nWhen cutting food, my spouse holds the fork in her right hand directly above the plate with the fork coming straight down into the food item. Then, with her left hand, she often drags the knife through the item to be cut using a great deal of force in a single motion.\n\nOk, so cut (pun not intended) to teaching the kids to use utensils: The eldest has been taught \u2018my way\u2019 (for lack of a better term) and is doing quite well at it. My spouse has always sort of rolled her eyes at me that I even cared, but hasn\u2019t really gotten in the way of me teaching the eldest. The middle child still struggles and commonly mashed up different versions of my spouse\u2019s methods and my methods, but usually she has the knife in her left hand and fork in the right, which in my view is backwards.\n\nToday I saw what the middle child was doing with her knife and fork during breakfast and suggested that maybe the two older kids should switch spots so I could show her how to do it properly. My spouse then showed her how to use the knife and for, except that it was backwards (fork in right hand and knife in left). I commented that the technique was correct but the hands would be reversed.\n\nMy spouse stated that there is no correct way to use utensils. I believe that there is a correct way to use them and that it is noticeable when a person does not. I believe this could have long-lasting ramifications on a person throughout their life. I imagine an important dinner with a client or superior, as an example.\n\nI think this boils down to a bit of pride on my spouse\u2019s part that I believe she\u2019s somehow not good enough because of the way that she uses utensils.

The earlier the children learn to eat properly, the easier it will be for them.

And to be fair, on many fronts, it probably is. But it's one of those things that doesn't matter until it does. \n\nFor example, at my work I'm often wined and dined by my boss in very nice restaurants. This wasn't an expectation with my job and isn't overly common in my field, but my boss is a foody and is very generous. I'm very grateful I know how to behave in a nice restaurant for this reason. \n\nEtiquette is old fashioned, but it doesn't all need to go. A bit of civility is nice. And I don't think you're an ass for merely teaching the kids the correct way to use cutlery.", "NTA because there definitely is a \"correct\" way to hold a knife and fork, just like there is a \"correct\" way to hold chopsticks, and a \"correct\" way to hold a spoon. \n\nIf someone wants to deviate from it because they don't find it comfortable or just don't like it then that's fine, but they should at least know the proper technique first!", "Apparently I will be downvoted to hell but NTA.\n\nit doesn\u2019t seem that important and maybe it is not that deep really but there is a proper way to use fork and knife and not using it or not knowing it will get laughed at when at work or at school.\n\nyou can choose to disregard the common use but  ot knowing and being unable to choose to be the one sticking out has to be a choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni remember in my family, my father was always using a childish version of a word, it\u2019 french so there no real equivalent but a bit like Sammy instead of sandwich.

Again it\u00a0\u2019s Not that important", "NTA\n\nIn fine dining etiquette there is indeed a \"right\" and \"wrong\" way to cut food. Not at least teaching the \"right\" way so that the child has the option to use it if they are ever privileged enough to go to a fine dining establishment is just silly. Just like everyone should also learn the right fork to use, even if all they remember from the lesson is start from the outside and work in. \n\nMy stepdad was a professional photographer of high end models and we had a videotape of proper etiquette that I watched constantly growing up. It included things like how to walk down stairs gracefully and how to get into and out of a vehicle without flashing everybody while wearing a skirt. Also how to properly introduce oneself to people. Things that people who care about etiquette would teach their children from a young age. But people not privileged enough to grow up in that situation could watch the video and learn it quickly.\n\nI had a girlfriend over a decade ago that got really upset with me, because I noticed her 13 year old daughter was holding her fork like a two year old holds crayons (in her fists) and having a difficult time cutting meat. So I tried to show her how to cut meat with the fork tines down, which is just easier, and got blown up at. Hopefully somewhere along the line she learned how to cut meat, because I never tried again. Not my kid, not my problem.\n\nNow, I don't care personally which hand someone uses their fork in, I would just ascribe it to left or right handedness, but there is etiquette for it. And your partner is doing their kids a disservice not allowing you to teach it.", "NTA \n\nThere really IS a right way to use utensils. And people DO judge someone's table manners in certain situations and places. \n\nThe way you described your wife's method makes me think of a sasquatch using a knife. The forceful sawing, the upright fork. Does she also hold the fork with a fist? It doesn't make someone less than, but it can be unpleasant to watch if it's bad enough.  \n\nAnyway, the reason you hold the knife in your dominant hand is because that hand is more dexterous and efficient. Do you slice food with your left hand during prep? No. Because it's dangerous besides inconvenient. It's also dangerous to cut your food on the plate with a nondominant hand because you have to apply more force (as evidenced by your wife) and your hand can slip and injure someone. And no, you don't then switch hands to eat. You keep using the fork in your left hand. \n\nSure, you can say etiquette doesn't matter, there's no right way, blah blah. But safety does matter. And while we certainly should be nice enough to not judge people for doing things differently, we should still teach kids the proper way.", "My son eats his food with a fork and knife.

It sounds inefficient, messy and likely to cause your elbows to end up in your neighbour\u2019s ear if you were sitting at a dinner table in polite company. Nope on so many levels. \n\nTbh, I would regard eating with my fork in my right hand for things that don\u2019t need cutting as an informal, relaxed way of eating that should be reserved for eating at home. \n\nBeing able to eat politely means you can do so much more- eat out with friends, go round to a partner\u2019s family house and make a good impression, have a meal put on company expenses and impress your boss\u2026 this isn\u2019t super fancy stuff either- this is basic food utensil etiquette. Stick to your guns. The kids will thank you later!", "NTA but I laughed at the idea that anyone down the line will give a damn how they eat their food unless they use their fingers for spaghetti.

My spouse would agree, and has.\n\nWhen dining, the eldest child just happens to sit next to me, and as a result I have had the opportunity to teach them how to use dining utensils (especially a knife and fork) the way that I was shown to do it, and how I see most people do it.\n\nFor reference I\u2019m referring to holding a fork in your left hand and using it with the tines pointing downward to hold whatever the item is to be cut, while using the right hand to hold the knife and cut the item as required using a back-and-forth sawing motion. When eating something that does not require cutting, I would use the fork in my right hand.\n\nWhen cutting food, my spouse holds the fork in her right hand directly above the plate with the fork coming straight down into the food item. Then, with her left hand, she often drags the knife through the item to be cut using a great deal of force in a single motion.\n\nOk, so cut (pun not intended) to teaching the kids to use utensils: The eldest has been taught \u2018my way\u2019 (for lack of a better term) and is doing quite well at it. My spouse has always sort of rolled her eyes at me that I even cared, but hasn\u2019t really gotten in the way of me teaching the eldest. The middle child still struggles and commonly mashed up different versions of my spouse\u2019s methods and my methods, but usually she has the knife in her left hand and fork in the right, which in my view is backwards.\n\nToday I saw what the middle child was doing with her knife and fork during breakfast and suggested that maybe the two older kids should switch spots so I could show her how to do it properly. My spouse then showed her how to use the knife and for, except that it was backwards (fork in right hand and knife in left). I commented that the technique was correct but the hands would be reversed.\n\nMy spouse stated that there is no correct way to use utensils. I believe that there is a correct way to use them and that it is noticeable when a person does not. I believe this could have long-lasting ramifications on a person throughout their life. I imagine an important dinner with a client or superior, as an example.\n\nI think this boils down to a bit of pride on my spouse\u2019s part that she\u2019s somehow not good enough because of the way that she uses utensils.\n\nSo, good people of Reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In some countries, it is customary and polite for people to eat only with their hands, scooping up food to put in their mouths. In some countries, it is customary and polite to slurp loudly when eating, to show appreciation for the food. (I would have been sent to my room for doing this, too, and honestly this practice really grosses me out -- but I have to recognize and respect that different cultures doing things different ways.)\n\nI was raised to eat fried chicken with my hands, and get every last bit of meat off the bones, but I have seen people who eat fried chicken exclusively with a knife and fork, never pick up the food with their hands, and thus leave a lot of meat on the bones.

Explain to them that there are different ways to eat, and they need to choose a method they are comfortable with which is also socially acceptable, and perhaps can do so by observing the people around them and seeing what is customary.", "If you can't even describe it, I don't trust your judgement that it's \"atypical\". I bet you if we saw this in action it would look pretty normal to a lot of people.", "Is she not left handed or was she forced to correct her left handedness. I do a lot of things in weird ways because I was forced to correct to use my right hand as a child.", "Me too! I feel less alone seeing that there are other right handed people who hold a knife with their left hand.", "Some Europeans use the fork in the left hand, knife in the right hand and use both utensils at the same time.\n\nMost Americans use the fork in the right hand and then switch back and forth when using the knife. Some Americans use fork and knife like state above.\n\nI will use both methods depending on what I'm eating and the fork and knife is preferably for some types of food.\n\nEthiopians use bread, called injera, to scoop up their food. By the way its absolutely delicious.", "This is a really good point. I figured this out the hard way. I am completely right handed and thought there was absolutely nothing I used my left hand for more than my right hand. But then one day I accidentally chopped off the end of my left thumb, and it was on that day that I figured out that I use my left hand to unbutton my jeans. It seems stupid, but it took a while for me to be able to unbutton my jeans with my right hand. So it\u2019s entirely possible that a certain task is the responsibility of one hand, despite that hand not being the dominant one.", "I\u2019m an ambidextrous..  when I was little, I use my left hand to write until I went to Catholic school \u2014 nun give with a ruler when I was writing.. I switch to my right hand. Now I eat with my left hand LoL", "I think teaching them correct technique is NTA but insisting they use the \"correct\" hands is wrong, if they do it correctly and safely but have the fork and knife in different hands to you what is the problem?", "I would just assume anyone using a knife in their left hand is left handed", "This just gave me a flashback to setting the table at my grandparants' house, I'd always set my sibling's spot opposite because they were left-handed. But actually thinking on it, I have no idea if they use the opposite hands or the 'right hands'. I do know that after 35 years they still haven't learned how to chew with their mouth closed.  \n\n\nI also could not describe how my mom holds utensils. I do know that she doesn't hold them the 'right way' because she is physically incapable of it (crooked arm from a bad break under the American healthcare system), but I've never spent the time to examine how she does do it. Because I don't spend time examining how anyone does it, I just focus on my own eating. I only know she can't because she has told me she sometimes watches normal-armed people eating with fascination. (Also when I was in elementary school I used to think her crooked arm was cool and every time I'd bring a new friend over I'd be all 'Show them your arm! Show them your arm!' and she'd sigh and hold out her arms)", "Do they?  I\u2019m English and have my fork in my left hand if I am also using a knife, but swap the fork to the right if not. It just feels weird in my left.", "Interesting.  I'm left handed and keep my fork in my left hand and knife in my right.\n\nETA:  But when I'm chopping/slicing/cutting food during meal preparation, I hold the chef's knife in my left hand.", "I wonder if in other cultures they teach using a knife and fork at the same age?  Think most Americans learn how to use a fork very young, then years later get taught to use a knife so they are probably already used to using the right hand for forking.", "Wait. Americans cut a single piece off, drop the knife, switch the fork over to their other hand, put the food in their mouth, then switch it back and pick up the knife? I was assuming they cut up all their food first then switched once.\n\nThey're holding a fork in their left hand, with the food on it (as the fork was in the food when it was cut), and have to pass it into their right hand in order to get it into their mouths. Please tell me I've misunderstood.", "But then your dominant right hand with finer motor control goes to waste as your left hand does all the forking.\n\nSo instead of learning to use a fork left handed, why not learn to use the knife left handed.  \n\nTo be fair back in my day it was sinful to use the left hand.  So I was initially taught to use only the right for both tasks.", "I'm left handed and can not use a fork with my right hand at all, or hold a pencil.", "This is a big forking deal.  The fate of proper etiquette hinges on this discussion.  Think of the cutlery.", "This. (unless you're taking cotillion lessons or planning on being invited to a state dinner).", "Depends on if you\u2019re in Europe or the US I guess, I don\u2019t really see anyone switching here (Europe)", "The fuck you talking about switching hands? What if you\u2019re eating something that could fall off the back of the fork? The whole point of proper technique is to make it easier. Switching hands would just make it unnecessarily complicated.\n\nEdit: apparently it\u2019s an American thing to switch hands. You\u2019re a weird mob over there.", "If you're American. People seem to be forgetting that etiquette is regional.", "Nothing wrong with teaching them. But your wife's method is equally valid, so don't get upset when she teaches them her way", "But doesn\u2019t that mean he switches hands? To cut the fork is in his left. To eat it\u2019s in his right. I was taught this way too. I lived abroad for 4 yrs, traveled a lot and I was definitely in the minority using utensils this way.", "Etiquette is regional. For example American vs European fork and knife rules. So OP is only teaching his kids part of the equation anyway. If he really cared to tech his kids how to fit in, he would teach them to observe and adjust to the people around him, not use a nonexistent \"universal standard\".", "If you\u2019re trying to impress a client and win business then good table manners are important, especially if entertaining foreign clients from countries where certain slips in etiquette are considered extremely rude", "I\u2019m a lefty and essentially do the mirror of this. I cut with my right hand and keep my fork in my left.", "The way I read it was that OP uses the European method, which is the only correct way to use a knife and fork.", "Now that I am becoming self-aware of how I use my utensils, I need to eat something I need to cut for my next meal.", "Ironically I'm right hand dominant but I write with my left hand lol", "Funnily enough, I\u2019m left handed and hold a knife in my right hand, while my right handed brother holds it in his left hand.", "Yeah, I also use the knife with my left hand and the only reaction I\u2019ve gotten from people in my 30 years of eating is them asking me if I was left handed", "I\u2019m a lefty and hold my knife in my right. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "In Australia, if you were eating something that needed both a knife and fork (eg a roast) I'll hold my fork in my left.\n\nBut if I'm only using a fork (eg pasta) I'll use my fork in my right.\n\nIs this what you do? Or something different?", "Apparently the American method (which is French) has began to caught on in the US. I think it proves that for most people it makes sense to use the fork with their dominant hand to eat.", "By preschool kids are given knives usually, but more to practise than actually use. It takes years to develop the fine motor skills to cut food easily, but by 8 or so, kids can cut most foods by themselves. (Things like cutting steak are harder to master)\n\nBut it's just one of those things we learn.", "Kids starting school age 4-5 must be able to use a knife and fork but usually learn before then. Switching fork from left to right would have been ironed out before then.", "Yes. Swap each bite. Cutting everything all at once is incorrect for an adult and only appropriate if you are cutting something up for small children.", "Forking requires much less precision.", "European style is fork in left hand. They're been doing it for a long time without any issues.", "I can use the fork or spoon with either hand. If I'm using a knife, I'll hold the fork in my left hand. If I'm not using a knife, I'll hold the fork or spoon in my right hand. If I'm eating pasta with a fork and spoon, I'll hold the spoon in my left and the fork in my right. If I'm eating cereal whilst playing on my phone, I'll hold the spoon in my left hand and the phone in my right. Basically, whatever is doing the fiddliest thing gets the dominant hand.", "I use the knife to help scoop food onto the fork. Everyone I know eats like that, so we use both hands - fork in the left, knife in the right. I'm European", "I\u2019ve never in my life seen an adult hold a knife in their left hand. If there\u2019s a knife involved fork is always in the left hand and knife in their right. I wouldn\u2019t judge someone if they did it differently, but I\u2019ve never seen it.", "The plate of the world is at stake", "I mean, I can only teach what I know to be \u201ccorrect\u201d based on what I\u2019ve been taught and my experiences in life.\n\nJudging me for failing to teach a child all of the possible methods in the world is maybe a bit far reaching. I\u2019m not teaching religious concepts here.", "That creates a disconnect though if your taught to use a fork by 3-4 dominant hand.  Then learn to use a knife at 8 ish dominant hand.\n\nThen knife and fork are in the same hand.\n\nIf you learned both skills at same time then I could understand teaching to use the non dominant hand for forking.", "This sums it up perfectly.", "*at steak", "I think it's fair for me to judge your assumption that there is only one \"correct\" way to use a fork and knife as you claimed in your post.", "Sorry, I didn't make myself clear.\n\nAround the age of 5, you start with the knife, and by the age of 8, most kids can cut most foods.\n\nAnd using a knife requires more fine motor skill than a fork, so it makes sense to put it in your dominant hand (at least it makes sense in my brain) the fork holds the food in place, while the knife does the cutting. Putting the food in your mouth isn't difficult. \n\nIt is a bit old fashioned I guess, but the 'proper' way to hold cutlery is efficient and keeps your elbows tucked into your sides, and not in someone else's."]}
