Yes. Was it mean? Yeah. But the truth can be harsh and mean.", "NTA I\u2019m surprised your siblings didnt back you up.

She's got a new little boy to spoil so she doesn't need the adult one any more.", "NTA\n\nThe truth hurts.

It was a borderline ESH, but I do feel for OP and she\u2019s NTA bc she has made multiple reasonable efforts to get her parents to change their behavior through communication, what more was she supposed to do? However, in letting a lifetime of unrequited complaints about favoritism and double standards bubble to the surface in your answer assessment to a mother who is incapable of seeing objective reality wasn\u2019t a high-success rate decision. \n\nUnfortunately for OP, it sounds like the one sister who does sympathize with her will only play neutral peacekeeper while parents and older sister can only see OPs words as unfair and cruel. Meanwhile OPs life-skills crippled brother will now get to play the victim card with OPs parents and family, getting them to pressure OP into helping finance his good-for-nothing existence until he can con some poor woman into marrying him. \n\nMy advice to OP is to take her time drafting a thorough and lengthy letter detailing her lifetime of frustrations about favoritism and double standards with an objective and neutral tone (to sound calm and rationale). Make sure the letter is an ask for understanding from OPs POV and leave things open for healthy reconciliation. Give it to each person in the family.

Mom created this situation. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I did wrong?!?!\u201d \u201cI did my best to love you and treat you all the same!\u201d We all know that\u2019s BS. If everyone else is held to high standards of cleanliness but bro doesn\u2019t know how to pick up a broom\u2026she did NOT treat them all the same. If everyone else had a job and is functioning but him and she thinks if she dies he will die bc he can\u2019t even make his own food\u2026she did NOT treat them all the same. I do my best to treat my kids fair and equal. (We make sure to remind them that fair isn\u2019t always equal and equal isn\u2019t always fair but for the most part if it is\u2026they get treated the same.) My oldest (13) will tell you that my parents treat my sister and I completely different. My oldest will tell you they favor my sister and treat her as the golden child (she phrased it differently). It upsets her. It hurts her. I tell her it\u2019s ok and that it doesn\u2019t bother me (I got over that a long time ago.). I\u2019m an adult and I provide for myself now. I have all I need and then some. Children know. My parents wondered why my sister and I didn\u2019t have a good relationship growing up. Why we weren\u2019t closer. (Why would we be? You favored her. I knew that as a child. My dad tried to compensate but failed at it. It was evident.) If I were to throw that in my parents\u2019 faces now\u2026that would be an a hole move. But when you lie to my face that you treated me equal and you don\u2019t know why my sister turned out how she did\u2026I\u2019m going to call you on it. OP didn\u2019t throw this out of the blue. The mom was playing the victim card and OP called her on it.", "Children know, but I have also seen children (especially teenagers) see things that aren\u2019t there. \n\nMaybe OP is right. Maybe her brother was favored. Her mom certainly doesn\u2019t seem to think so. Everyone else seems to think OP was out of line. And unless OP has significant problems with reading social cues and interactions, she *knew* that she was presenting this in a way that would hurt her mom, rather than a way it would be heard. And then she claims she didn\u2019t do it to hurt her, which is right bullshit - that\u2019s not something you say unless you intend to hurt. \n\nSo, with the evidence that OP is already being misleading *and* the rest of the family thinks she was wrong, I\u2019m less inclined to take OP\u2019s view as reliable."]}
