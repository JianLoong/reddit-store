She pretty much ditched them both. My dad has been divorced from my mom since I was a kid so I lived between them both but I mostly lived with my dad as I got older because he lives in a penthouse.\n\nMy dad is getting old (58) and my brother Ashton is 10. I have always been very close to Ashton and never had to discipline him. My dad has been slipping over the last few years and I've been stepping up with Ashton because he's become an alcoholic. Oh well but he still has money.\n\nLately I've had to discipline Ashton for not listening or being disrespectful or doing stupid stuff. \n\nFor example the other night I told him to go shower and he said no because I'm not his dad. So I made him. I asked him if he finished his homework and he said he doesn't have to answer me because it's his homework. I asked him to clean his room and he said he didn't ask me if what my opinion was about his room. \n\nI got tired of fighting with him so I took him my his arms and said yes, he does need to listen to me. I'm an adult in the house and he is the child. If it wasn't for me then he'd be eating cream cheese and ginger ale for dinner. If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have clean clothes. If it weren't for me then you'd probably be spending time with that weird neighbor who wanted to take him to Disneyland.\n\nHe told me to let him go and cried and ran to his room. He gave me the silent treatment as if this morning. My girlfriend thinks I should apologize to him but I don't think I did anything wrong. Don't think because he is cute that it means he's innocent", "created_utc": 1683664911, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13d5d6s/aita_for_telling_my_brother_that_yes_he_does_need/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think he needs therapy. I know people are quick to say that but he's been through a lot as a 10 year old and the average person is not equipped to deal with this kind of issue.", "NAH. Try to get some kind of real decision making abilities though because this kid needs some major counseling before he ends up a very angry teenager.\n\nEdit: there is an A H here but it\u2019s not OP or their 10yo brother.", "NTA The only asshole here is your Dad for leaving parenting responsibilities for you.", "NTA you just told him the truth that your basically his parent , it probably got him in his feelings about his mom and your guys dad :(", "FWIW my kid your brother's age does the same and I'm his Dad. You're NTA. Sorry you have to be a parent cause your Dad is failing. Good on you for stepping up. You should probably sit down and establish the ground rules well, but for sure he'll keep testing you.", "NAH except your dad. Ashton is upset with you because he knows his dad isn't stepping up and he feels that absence. He's not an asshole, he's a hurt and confused kid. He's lashing out at you because your dad is being a fuckup and not parenting like he needs to.\n\nI do think you should have some empathy though because what he's going through is rough and I would apologize for speaking harshly. 'He's not innocent' makes me feel like you're imputing malice here that really doesn't exist.", "100% NTA. You\u2019re more of a parent to that child than the people who made him are.", "NTA, as long as your disiplinary actions weren't physical abuse...\n\nMaybe get some good books on parenting. Important is that if you want your brother to respect your authority, you need to earn his respect first. Sounds like your brother is getting into his rebellious phase and this is only the beginning of your troubles.... good luck mate.", "NTA. Shame you have to become the parent. To your little brother. Kudos for stepping up. Sometimes kids get mad and throw tantrums, especially if they are being told to do stuff they haven't had to before. Sometimes it's testing boundaries, sometimes it's something else. \n\nIdk really the proper course but you're trying to help", "NTA - sounds like you may be the only adult in his life who isn\u2019t an AH", "NTA- you\u2019re practically the only parent he has. you\u2019re kinda like Fiona from Shameless. the boy needs structure and you\u2019re giving it to him. he is your blood brother. you are his elder. he needs to listen to you.", "Info: you lived with your dad as he had a penthouse.  I'm not quite following that bit...?\n\nWhat age are you?\n\n\n\n\nEta - typo", "INFO\n\n> I took him my his arms\n\nThe heck does this mean?\n\nYou hugged him?\n\nPicked him up?\n\nRestrained him?", "\u201cI told him to go shower and he said no because I\u2019m not his dad.

How aggressive was this action?", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately you are in the awkward position of being the considerably older sibling and only viable parent. Not teaching him the things he needs to be a successful and respectful adult would resound into every area of his life as he gets older. One day he will appreciate it, but not until he comes into the age of understanding. Parents are not friends. Friends focus on being liked. Parents have to instill values and that can come with a lot of disdain from the kid. It's okay not to always be liked, so long as you are doing what needs to be done because you love them. \n\nHe is also dealing with a lot of abandonment. Be patient and try to get him the help he needs to cope, grow, and come out strong.", "Mentally preparing for downvotes and anger for this one lol.\n\nFor me this is a NAH (unless \"took him in your arms\" refers to violence or forcibly preventing him from walking away from you, then Y-T-A).\n\nThe thing is, you don't get to decide for him that he consider you a parent.\n\nYou only get to decide if you think of him as your child, but you don't get to decide how he feels about you on his behalf.\n\nA lot of people will say you are entitled to him considering you his parent after all the things you've done for him. But for me that would be a hypocritical viewpoint, as I don't think \"beloved parent\" is a title someone is owed just because they performed what they consider to be enough \"parental interactions\" to a standard they consider high enough, be they a step parent, bio parent, foster parent, adoptive parent or anything else. \n\nLife isn't sims. There isn't a relationship bar you can fill whether the other person wants you to or not. \n\nYou decided to be a parent to him, he didn't make that choice.\n\nI'd suggest talking to him and explaining that if he's going to choose not to have you as a parent, then that includes losing all of it, not just the annoying stuff like you telling him to do his homework. But give him his choice, don't tell him he has no agency and must obey you. \n\nHell give him a weeks trial run of it where you don't get his meals or wash his clothes etc.", "NTA. You are perfectly within your rights to expect Ashton to listen to you and to mete out minor punishments such as sending him to his room when he doesn't comply. Talk to your dad about this arrangement though. He needs to get off the sauce and step up. Poor kid has been abandoned by his mother and left to his own devices by his father. Of course he's going to act out, he's 10. Worst case scenario, once you move out you may end up having to call CPS on your dad for neglect and/or abuse. Ashton is lucky he has you to keep him clean and fed, etc. He just needs to learn gratitude.", "NTA, you are stepping up.  There is an issue to do need to address.  You stated your dad has an alcohol problem.  This needs to be addressed.  Your little brother sees this as well, this may be the root of his issues.  He needs professional counseling as do you.  You also need to seek legal advice.  Is you dad making sure your brother gets proper medical and dental care?  Depending on where you live you might not be legally able to sign off on this.  Is there a plan in place if your dad had a major medical issue or dies?  Just because you are a much older brother does not mean you get custody if something happens.  Check into this for you little brother's sake.", "NAH.\n\nYes, your brother needs to listen to you because you're the responsible adult, but he's also 10. 10 year olds do this kind of thing, especially when they have an alcoholic for a parent. \n\nMy only recommendation is to lay out ground rules and consequences in a clear and concise way - you break this rule, this is what happens, and make sure it's actually effective for him. So if he likes going to the park, don't let him unless his room is clean (for example).\n\nBut also have some empathy. He's lashing out for a reason, and while you're not the cause, you're the only thing he can lash out at. Show anger at the situation without directing it at him, lead by example.", "Definitely NTA but you need to have a heart to heart with your dad and try to get him to get himself on the right track, for his young son!!", "> I got tired of fighting with him so I took him my his arms and said yes, he does need to listen to me.\n\nOP, your situation sucks and I know you mean well and it sounds like there's nobody else who will step up for your brother and you've been forced into a parenting role you didn't ask for and that things are probably extremely stressful, but physically grabbing a kid and throwing your parenting in his face is not going to make anything better. His home life is *also* extremely shitty, but he's a 10 year old who doesn't know better; it might be difficult, but you can't use force to make him comply unless you are like, actively stopping him from doing something dangerous, and arguing about homework doesn't rise to that level.\n\nI know you're trying to best, but in this situation you acted like an asshole.", "YTA in this situation. You do need to step into the father role. You need clear authority before you do so. Your dad needs to tell Ashton that, yes, he does have to listen to you, and you\u2019ve been given parental authority.\r  \n\r  \nOnce that's clear, I don't think you'll have as many problems.", "NAH/Everyone is AH\n\nThe kid needs a parent who cares but you shouldn't be putting hands on him to show him you are boss.  Totally unnecessary.  And really, if the only way someone will listen is because you can strong on him, have fun once he's bigger", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While i was growing up, my dad was an alcoholic and it's real tough to deal with at such a young age.", "NTA", "YTA not because you want him to listen to but this is a 10 year with a distant alcoholic father and a deadbeat mother. You should not have to be in charge of your brother but what he doesn't need is someone physically confronting him for disobedience when he's not had a proper adult in his life at this moment, what you should be doing is fostering a connection with him so he has someone he can actually rely on if that's what you want to do. Otherwise by demanding things and resorting to aggression will push this child away and leave him bad off in a different way than simply having absent parents would. You can't just take care of physical needs, children need their emotional needs taken care of too. Like if you're not able to provide that you should report it to somebody or fucking anything else other than trampling on their emotions and feelings in this incredibly shitty situation they seem to be in.", "YTA-yes Ashton needs an adult, but he needs his adult sibling, too.  Grabbing his arm and/or physically forcing him to do things isn\u2019t great or helpful.  He also doesn\u2019t need told that without you none of those things would happen, his situation isn\u2019t his fault.\nApologize for acting like a parent and find a way to be a sibling and giving discipline when needed.
