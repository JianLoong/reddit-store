What will they do when you move out?  \n\n\nGiven how timid you seem, I would start by being often at a library or friends house studying - if you're not home, they can't dumb the kids on you as easily.   \n\n\nSlowly increase the amount you pushback. Use their own tactics against them - instead of saying \"you're making me babysit too much\", if you mother sends the kids to you while you're studying say \"I need the family to support me like I support everyone, education is important so I won't be able to have them in my room today\" etc.   \n\n\nDon't try and reason with them and get the acknowledgement you deserve for your sacrifices and their bad behaviour and abuse (parentification is abuse). This will be a pointless exercise with these people because anybody that selfish and entitled will never care that they hurt you or admit and apologise to help you feel better and heal. Just focus on the practical outcome of not watching the kids when you're not available and decreasing the amount they try and manipulate you to do so.  \n\n\nBefore you start vocally refusing to watch them, I would make sure you have your documents (birth certificate, passport, bank which your parents cannot access etc) in a safe place with a friend - out of the house. In case they decide to become abusive and either withhold your documents, or try and kick you out without them.   \n\n\nYou're NTA. You deserve to focus on your own goals and dreams.", "NTA. \n\nMaybe your sister was too young then and she didn\u2019t know better but Lou is still her biological child and she\u2019s responsible for taking care of him. \n\nYou can be there when she and Lou need you, but you have your own problem and your own life to take care of. \n\nHave a proper talk with both her and your parents.", "You\u2019re a great sister, a great daughter and a really loving aunt, but you shouldn\u2019t have to be this involved in doing the parenting for your sister and your mom. They\u2019ve only been able to abdicate their responsibilities because of you. NTA but set boundaries!", "NTA- your sister made the choice to keep her baby and she\u2019s still not around to take care of her. You stepped up, you\u2019re putting your life in jeopardy for people who haven\u2019t given you anything in return for your efforts.\n\nResearch parentification- although that usually applies to a child taking on a parental role for their own parent, I couldn\u2019t find a term specifically for children having to raise children that aren\u2019t their own, and the negative effects are similar between the two.\n\nGood luck on your finals!", "Definitely NTA, people should accept the consequences of their own actions and you only need to help if you want to help at that given time. So basically, you should be asked and not forced to", "NTA\n\nIf you can go to the library or school to study that might force them to make other arrangements.", "NTA. You have been putting everyone else before you since you were 11. You have been taking care of your niece so much that she thinks you're her primary caregiver. You were a child, supposed to be taken care of by the adults in your life just like your niece.\n\nYour sister put herself first after she gave birth and didn't miss out on her life.\n\nYour mother is an AH, you're being taken advantage of. By your parents and your sister.\n\nYou're 18, put some distance with them. Consider college at a different city or getting a job and moving out. You have to start putting yourself first immediately.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is complaining that her daughter doesn't talk to her...honestly, she didn't raise her. She disclosed to you because you did.\n\nYou were also 11 and should not have been left with a new born alone. It seems like you sister didn't want to and isn't capable of being a parent. Your sister is selfish. If she was \"grown up and responsible enough\"to do the deed, she should be the primary carer for HER child. \n\nYou are not selfish for wanting to live your life.

But I know it\u2019s hard to get family to respect this boundary. You should try to calmly tell them how you feel, and then get your license and be home less so they can\u2019t do it. It sounds like your parents are the main problem not your sister- if your mom is saying she can watch them then leaving the responsibility to you. It\u2019s also hard now that Lou is used to you doing stuff for her she won\u2019t ask the others even if she could. That\u2019s another reason you need to be home less at first ti help establish the boundary. Or try to set up a \u201cclosed door no distractions\u201d policy with Lou too-where no one comes in. This would mean that you would have to hear them struggle to take care of her like you but they\u2019ll learn.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou need to make sure you have time to study. Is there somewhere you can go away from the house to study so they can't just dump the kids on you?", "NTA stop doing anything for them and focus on getting your education and drivers lycence and get out!", "Also because you have been doing it for so long, I think its important for OP to know that the bond that you have with Lou is independent- you\u2019re already in each others hearts. You can prioritize yourself and It\u2019s not a dis-service to anyone.", "So a 15 year old is too young to take care of her own child but the 11 year old aunt is fine?? Ffs.", "I will say it again and again: you are NTA. What your sister and mother did is wrong and they are taking advantage of you. Time for you to set boundaries and don't let them treat you like a doormat at the expense of your social life, hobbies and academic time.\n\nYour sister needs to stop treating you as a free babysitter just because you are blood relatives. She needs to grow up and start acting like a real parent. What she is doing is unfair on you and the little kid\n\nRemember you are not selfish too", "This comment is so kind and sssooo very intelligent! I hope OP follows it to the letter.", "I'm guessing they also used the 'older sister is working hard to enter uni, it's an important time for her education bla bla but younger sis still has time before she gets to the bridge' excuse as well.\n\nThis scenario happens a lot where I am. Also, the older sibling enter the workforce early to support the younger siblings or the parent focuses on the 'smartest' sibling in hopes they can support the family. Usually it happens in low income families. Schooling is free until 17yo but you have to pay for uniforms, transportation, school supplies and some school admin fees around 150 local currency per year.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to take care of yourself first.\n\nWatching your niece and your brother is your mom's responsibility, not yours. If them making noise prevents your mom from taking a nap, then she just doesn't get to take a nap.\n\nYou absolutely should tell your mom and your sister that watching their kids is not your responsibility. You'll help when you can, but they need to ask if you can help, not just dump kids on you and assume you'll take care of them. Studying for your exams needs to be a higher priority for you right now. And there will be days when you simply want a break. You should be able to say \"no\" to watching the kids even if you don't have something important to do.", "This is the advice I came to give. Find somewhere new to study, a local public library, your school library, or even university libraries are often public (the basement at the one near my house used to be my favourite place to study, it was ALWAYS quiet and mostly abandoned so I could spread my papers out everywhere while color coding my notes), a friends house, even a quiet nook in a coffee shop outside of busy hours or a book store. If you have a free period at school you can also ask teachers if they know if any classrooms will be empty.\n\nIf you\u2019re not at home you can\u2019t be forced to watch the children. I know that when I was studying for finals I usually was only at home to sleep and eat breakfast.", "NTA\n\nYour Mother and Sister took so much Time of you for \"Raising\" the Kids, even through you are a Child yourself. And your Mother does not support you to have enough Time to Study for School and Driver-License. \n\nYou took so much Time and Effort with the Kids, and i guess you didnt get Money or even enough Freetime to hang out with others? They treat you like a Free-babysitter", "I would do what everyone is suggesting be there as little as possible, and if you get pushback on it, ask them why they feel that you did not birth This child should be more of a parental figure than the actual parent. Ask them if your studies don\u2019t matter as much as your sister. Also, let them know if you want it to be a mother you would\u2019ve had your own kid.", "that's a great point!", "I hope so too, posts like this from kids break my freaking heart :(", "OP is NTAH, the kid has a mother.

Study at a library or at a friend's house. You will never get any peace at home.", "Get up very early in the morning, go to a coffee shop to study, then go to the library. Go home when you are done. These two kids are not your children, are not your responsibility, and if you have to leave and go study elsewhere, you should do it.
