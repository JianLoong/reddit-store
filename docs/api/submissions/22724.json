But it was different enough my dog had to test it.", "which is funny. if you don\u2019t know anything about dogs, as she said, why the hell did she want you left alone with her dog at all, let alone without a leash? nta.", "That's seriously so bizarre. Does she not even have a leash around for emergencies like this? How does she take the dog to the vet? She's either a militant animal rights activist of some kind or she's extremely embarrassed that you called her out on her bs like this.", "This, so much. \n\nI have a dog-reactive dog who is always leashed, but people love to let their unleashed dogs run up to her while they yell \"it's OK, he's friendly!\" \n\nLike, great, but mine isn't. She was attacked once, and despite training, she's afraid if another dog gets in her immediate space. And if she did bite, it would still be on me (and her), instead of the irresponsible idiot who decided that leash laws don't apply to them."]}
