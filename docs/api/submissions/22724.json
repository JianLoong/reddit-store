I visit her place atleast once every month and Jeffy loves me and loves to play w me etc.\n\nYesterday my friend called me and asked if I could walk Jeffy at night since she had to leave for something urgent and wouldn't be able to be back in time to walk him. I said sure and asked her to keep his leash and collar by the door so I could take him out. The route they walk him on is a busy-ish street till we get to the park. \n\nShe told me that they don't keep him on a leash, he's very well behaved and will walk beside them when they take him out and will stop and sit if they stop (he's trained). I agree that he's well behaved, but I told her I'd be uncomfortable taking him out without a leash, since I don't have enough experience with dogs and he can get excited at times. She said that it won't be an issue as Jeffy is very calm on walks. I again said that i understand, but as calm as he may be, he's an animal and we don't know how he might react if he got excited/scared by a human or another dog. Or if he runs away and gets lost. I just wouldn't know what to do in that case.\n\nShe said that I'm overthinking this and I should just take him out without a leash as he feels restricted on a leash and can't explore. I again told her that i don't think I can walk him without a leash, especially since half of that route is a kinda busy road with lots of distractions till we get to the park. She said that if I put a leash on him, that'd be \"abuse\" since he's been out without a leash for a while now. \n\nThen i said that I don't think I could take the responsibility of walking him without a leash. She got annoyed and said that i have no knowledge of dogs and I should just listen to her. I refused again, and she got angry (she was in a hurry cuz she had to leave) and said that I'm being a bitch for no reason and refusing to help her when I easily could. She then told me that she can't believe I'd be more comfortable if Jeffy was being abused by wearing a leash and then cut the call.\n\nShe then asked her MIL to walk the dog instead.
