She\u2019s 38 weeks pregnant. Yesterday she was cleaning all day long. This morning I got all of our extra stuff and took it to storage in the rain. After that I sat on the couch and played video games. Throughout the day I would ask if she needed help with tasks like laundry and vacuuming and other things just generally asking if she needed help with anything around the house. She told me no. I asked around 20 more times throughout the day. Every time it was a no. When she was done cleaning she then started to yell at me about how lazy I am and how I never help her around the house. I asked her why she said no when I asked her if she needed help. She said it was because she wanted to see if i would do it anyway even if she said no. I told her that makes no sense at all and if she just needed help she just had to say yes during one of the may times I asked. She says that she shouldn\u2019t have to ask me to clean. But she never asked I always offered she always says no. We got into an argument over it and now she\u2019s calling family members for validation. I don\u2019t understand how Ita if I offer help and you don\u2019t take it I don\u2019t see that as my fault pregnant or not if my wife says she can handle then I believe she can.", "created_utc": 1701684405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ah4jo/aita_my_wife_is_pregnant_and_says_i_dont_help_her/", "score": 131, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You do not \"help\" keep your house clean. You contribute to the chores in the house you also live in.\n\nLook at the house like \"what needs cleaning?\"\n\nSpot two things in different rooms and say \"would it help you more if I did X or Y?\n\nIdeally things like VACUUMING. And stuff that is physically demanding on your 38 WEEK PREGNANT WIFE.\n\nYou're an adult. It's not up to her to hold the mental load of chores also.\n\nIf you're that unsure. Talk to her about it!\nSit down. Have a convo.\n\n\"You're right. You do lots, and you also plan and think about it all. All I do is play video games, there's about to be a baby so shits about to get real - what are the chores you hate the most? Can I do the vaccuming? I'll cook and do the dishes for at least a month post birth (ESPECIALLY IF SHE'S BREASTFEEDING)\n\nHow would you like the house kept the first few weeks with baby? Then you take on the mental load to get it done. And do it.", "YTA. Do we really still have to explain the mental load to people? Guys, it\u2019s *exhausting*. \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting having to manage the chores, it\u2019s exhausting having to assign tasks, it\u2019s exhausting having to follow up, it\u2019s exhausting having to re-do the things that weren\u2019t done properly, it\u2019s exhausting feeling like you\u2019re bossing your adult partner around because he doesn\u2019t take ownership of mutual household responsibilities, and it\u2019s exhausting having to explain why it\u2019s exhausting all the time. And a lot of the time it\u2019s faster to just do things than having to micromanage someone else as well as staying on top of my own share of chores. \n\nWhen you\u2019re at work, do you sit around idly and wait for your manager to ask you for everything they need? Do you go to them and ask them what needs doing every time you finish one task, even if they need doing on a regular basis? Well guess what. Chores are also your job. If the dishwasher needed emptying after running last week, it\u2019ll need emptying after running this week, and *every bloody time after running in future*. You don\u2019t need your wife to tell you that. Act like a grown ass man and especially so if your wife is 38 weeks pregnant. \n\nAlso, google the mental load and stop making us explain it to you.", "YTA\n\n\"I would ask if she needed help with tasks like laundry and vacuuming and other things just generally asking if she needed help with anything around the house\"\n\nDo the f\\*cking  things WITHOUT asking.

Your wife deserves a partner that doesn't look at basic chores as \"helping.\"", "YTA. \n\nYoure 23, you can see the dirt on the floor and vacuum on your own. You can check the laundry bins and put a load on if they\u2019re full. You can dust the cupboards if you see dust. Relying so heavily on a person (who\u2019s, to add insult to injury, 38 weeks pregnant???!!!!) is absolutely cruel. Her having to take mental notes of everything because you\u2019re too lazy to think on your own makes her so much more tired than she already is. Why? Why can\u2019t you act like a grown up and get your ass off the couch and clean? Why does your 38 week pregnant wife have to break her back cleaning two days in a row while you sit on the couch? SHE should be the one resting right now. YOU should be cleaning and helping her relax as much as possible. You\u2019re a huge asshole op. If I would ever be put in the situation you put your wife into, I would strongly consider divorce. Act like a man.", "YTA. Why are you ASKING?? Do you have eyes?! Can you not see for yourself what needs doing????", "Okay first of all, you're both 23 and have a lot of maturing to do regardless of the fact you are married with a child and expecting another baby. You both need to work on communication. \n\nSecondly, your wife is 38 weeks pregnant. She is nesting. She shouldn't have to ask you to help around the house, if you see your heavily pregnant wife cleaning and doing housework, the absolute last thing on this earth that should be on your mind or even a priority at this point is playing video games. You should WANT to help her, she shouldn't even be doing anything at this point, except resting. \n\nI mean seriously? Playing video games? Are you a child? If you need to play video games so bad, wait until the end of the day when all of the other priorities like housework are taken care of. You say shes pregnant with your 2nd child? So where is your other kid while you're playing video games and your wife is busy cleaning/doing housework? are you taking care of them? are you ignoring them? do you need to be told and given directions on taking care of your own child? I don't even know how you would have time to play video games with a wife who is about to give birth and another child to look after. \n\nHave you done anything to help her prepare for the baby? If you have so much free time to sit around playing video games, you should have time to meal prep for when she gives birth and you have 2 kids and even less time for yourselves. \n\nYTA. Step up. Help out more without being asked, if she says no, do it anyway or find something else that you can do to make her life easier.", "Are you a child? No wife wants to have to treat you like a teenager and specifically request each task that needs doing. Take some initiative my man. YTA.", "YTA - you may have been completely clueless in the situation, but just know that going forward, this shouldn\u2019t be normalized. your wife is 38 weeks pregnant, preparing to give birth. she should be resting, not putting her body through labour when she will be going through plenty of labor giving birth. i completely understand why she got upset and tried to see if you would still help although she said no. those home chores were things that had to get done, and because you weren\u2019t doing the work, she decided to take that step and get everything done. just because she said no, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s actually no. maybe ask \u201cdo you really mean no, or are you just saying that?\u201d, and even if she still said no, just insist that that is the way you want to go about it. i can\u2019t even recall the amount of times i\u2019ve told my boyfriend no when i needed help on things but once he finally insisted on helping me it felt so much better. and once you have your child, there is no more sitting playing video games - that is a luxury. you cannot expect to have a happy wife and child if you are sitting around while she is not only looking after another human being, but the house and all it\u2019s demands and even her husband. so like i said, yta and i mean that in the kindest way. please think about ways you could help more, and understand that women are different. it may come across as difficult to understand, but you will get the hang of it if you try. best of luck, and congrats on a second child.", "YTA your wife is right when she said she shouldn\u2019t need to ask, it\u2019s just as much your responsibility as it is her. Plus she\u2019s also about to push a human out of her body, don\u2019t have any clue how freaking tired and uncomfortable she is? I can\u2019t even believe you wrote this out and didn\u2019t immediately delete it.", "YTA\n\nWhy do you need to HELP her? Did you not wear any of the clothes to be laundered? Are the kids whose clothes need laundering not half yours?  You actually sat in the couch and played video games while watching your 38wk pregnant wife clean all day and are confused as to why she's upset? \n\nJust get off your ass and clean something.  Don't ask.  Don't wait to be told to do it.  Recognize that a task needs doing and do it... and don't ask for praise for doing the bare fucking minimum.", "YTA. My partner used to do this, it\u2019s absolutely exhausting to be mentally responsible for what you think you should doing or not. You\u2019re asking if she wants you to do the laundry - so clearly it needs doing, get off your butt and help!! Don\u2019t be so dense.", "Yta. Dude, your actual mistake is getting married and having the first kid. And then you doubled it down with the second one. Seriously? Your wife who might give birth anyday now is doing household chores and you are playing video games? I have seen 5yos help their pregnant mothers way more than this. You need a reality check.", "If you see a task at work that falls within your responsibilities, do you ask your boss if they need your help to do it?\n\nIf you just get your tasks done without needing your boss to validate and thank you every little step of the way, why are you incapable of applying that skill set at home?!\n\nIf you had no partner, would you need to call your mum for her to validate that you need to wash your towels? Of course not. You'd be responsible enough to know they need washing. \n\nYour wife doesn't want to carry the mental load of your home. She's not the one who needs to write your chore roster and give you gold stars for competing each one. \n\nUse your adult brain and look for what needs doing yourself - then get it done. Stop infantalising yourself. \n\nYTA", "YTA \nhiw come something urges you enough to ask 20 times if she needs help but not enough to just get up and do the chores. She is not your mom she doesn't need to tell you what to do", "YTA. It's a case of the work is there. It's no mystery laundry needs to be done. Why ask? Just do a load or two.", "Couldn\u2019t even finish reading. Yes yta. You\u2019re a child having children. It\u2019s scary. Your wife will have 3 kids to look after and tell what to do", "YTA\n\nWhy don't you simply do the chores that need to be done, why is the default that she does them and you *help*? Just pick up the vacuum and vacuum. Or if you see laundry needing to be done, do it. Look with your own eyes and find out which chores need to be done.", "YTA help? do you also babysit your child? or offer graciously to help your wife to pay for the bills for the family? Remove your head out of your ass and do your share of YOUR housework while you still have a wife.\n\nand it makes it even worse that she is 38 weeks pregnant. Am at the same stage - my husband almost yells at me if a lift a finger at this stage - my job is to finish this baby his is to do all the housework according to him", "YTA- your wife should have to ask you to help around the house. She isn\u2019t a project manager. She is 38 weeks pregnant, that is exhausting. This is called the mental load, you are adding to it.", "Yeah YTA. How could you even play video games while watching your heavily pregnant wife clean and do other chores?? Your wife should be resting while you are proactive about doing the chores. Why are you asking her if she needs help before you do chores? The chores should automatically fall on you. You really need to grow up, you\u2019re about to be a father\u2026", "YTA. \n\nI remember being so huge and tired at that stage, I wasn\u2019t doing much.

Don\u2019t ask or offer that\u2019s pathetic and presumptuous. Just do it, you know, exactly like she was already doing. Time to put your big boy pants on is long overdue apparently.", "Going forward you should insist she not be cleaning and to relax and you clean the house instead. That\u2019s how you can support her and care for her. She\u2019s so far along in the pregnancy, she should be taking it easy, not you! You have to step up and handle things like house cleaning for her, that\u2019s one of the ways you can support her while she\u2019s pregnant. You never ask to help, you jump right in and assume the duties and make her feel supported and cared for. Playing video games while she\u2019s cleaning the house is not how you make your wife feel supported and cared for.", "YTA what do you mean you \"offered to help\". It's YOUR home, you are not \"helping\" her, it is not her job. You both do it because it is both of your homes. You shouldn't be \"offering\" to do anything, you be doing what needs to be done because it needs to be done and because she asks you to.

Although, I guess it did get her point proven.\n\nIts not your job to 'help' around the house - your language reveals your mindset about the situation and that you see the housework as your wife's domain. You're a grown ass man and you live there too so the chores are equally your responsibility.

It was easier for her to just do it, despite how much it made physically uncomfortable and exhausted her, than deal with YOU.", "Are you daft? Is she your maid? You're married not in a contracted relationship. 'Offered to help', like it's her job. Should you be told when and when not to clean your room? Should you be told when and when not to do laundry, take away dishes? With a pregnant wife at that. I know some couples split it, but from the way you're sounding, she's probably been the one doing all the chores while you play video games and 'offer to help', she probably just lost it now. \n\nYTA, sincerely, YTA", "YTA.

How would that make you feel. I bet you\u2019d be doing it angry and slamming things if she just sat on her ass and played video games. When you have a family the need for you to both do household chores become even more important. Step it up, especially since she\u2019s carrying your child. Something you can\u2019t help her with.

Use your brain sir. You better step it up before this baby comes and after this baby comes bc when your wife hasn\u2019t slept in days and you keep up this routine- well I hope you enjoy seeing your kids every other weekend. This is a deal breaker for women. She will divorce you if you keep this crap up. No one wants another child (that\u2019s a full grown adult) to take care of, and do you really want to be that?

After that I sat on the couch and played video games. Throughout the day I would ask if she needed help with tasks like laundry and vacuuming and other things just generally asking if she needed help with anything around the house. She told me no. I asked around 20 more times throughout the day. Every time it was a no. When she was done cleaning she then started to yell at me about how lazy I am and how I never help her around the house. I asked her why she said no when I asked her if she needed help. She said it was because she wanted to see if i would do it anyway even if she said no. I told her that makes no sense at all and if she just needed help she just had to say yes during one of the may times I asked. She says that she shouldn\u2019t have to ask me to clean. But she never asked I always offered she always says no. We got into an argument over it and now she\u2019s calling family members for validation.

I've run on autopilot a lot, and have never told anyone to not do things I want them to do. I also wouldn't feel I'm taking another task by saying \"yes, do it\".
