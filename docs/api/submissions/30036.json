You are NOT compatible, sad to say. If you're a cat person and he isn't, that's a dealbreaker right there. I get that it's allergies, in part, but just no. I feel like it's a HUUUGE and unreasonable demand to ask someone to get rid of pets they've bonded to. \n\nYou'll find someone who will love you and your cat family. Do not compromise here; you'll really regret it later.", "NTA. If he isn\u2019t willing to accept your cats, you aren\u2019t really compatible \n\nI had 2 cats (now deceased) when o started dating my now husband. He still jokes with his adult kids that he knew if forced to choose between him or the cats, he would lose. Cats were here first", "NTA. Suggest to him a compromise of living separately until your older cat naturally passes away, and then him agreeing to live with the bonded pair of two cats. If he says no, or if down the road he starts trying to weasel out of it, walk away", "NTA and GTFO.\n\n\"He states that it is because he is (mildly) allergic to cats and because it is unhygienic.\"\n\nBut only for your cats, not his.\n\n\"allowing me to keep my 15 year old cat\"\n\nAllowing?  Girl RUN.  He's got control issues.  Chose the cats.", "NTA\n\n*His* cat is fine, but yours aren't?  *Allowing* you to keep your elder cat?  Ha ha ha ha ha *no.*  I promise you, things do not get less controlling from here.\n\nTake your cats and run.  This guy is not the one.", "NTA. Hopefully I don't sound like an asshole here, but I don't believe people who don't equally love animals should be together. It's just asking for conflict. I'm with you, animals are family. If animals were human children and a spouse said you could only bring home your oldest, any sane person would end that relationship.", "NTA. \"Allowing\" you to keep one cat? Sounds like a condescending jerk. Lose the bf. Keep the cats.", "NTA I would never move in with someone who didn't accept all my pets. They're living creatures, not toys who can just be tossed aside when they become inconvenient. \n\nWhen my husband and I moved in together, we managed to end up with 7 cats. I had 4, he had 3. Obviously having 7 cats was not in our life plans but shit happens and neither one of us expected the other to get rid of anyone.  And it's only as unhygienic as you allow it to be. \n\nIt was 14 years ago that we moved in together and we now only have 1 remaining cat. Sadly, 4 cats will not stay 4 cats forever, and it's not always the oldest ones who kick the bucket first. \n\nAnyway, pets are a dealbreaker for me. They were here before you, they'll be here after if that's the way you want it.", "NTA. I understand why your boyfriend doesn't want a total of 4 cats in the house, but if you were to agree, there would probably be lingering resentment there which isn't good.", "NTA. It's one thing to have not have planned to live with so many cats, but you actually ask you to get rid of two of them? Who does that?! Ugh. You just don't get rid of creatures you are bonded to and vice versa, not just because some guy doesn't want so many cats. They are living creatures, not possessions. If he loves you, he has to accept you come with these cats. If he can't, boy bye. You will find someone who will love your cats as much as you.", "NTA. How would he react to you saying ok, we can restrict ourselves to having just 2 cats - get rid of yours and choose 2 of mine?\n\nYou enter a relationship with \u201cbaggage\u201d and when you move in together, that \u201cbaggage\u201d (cat/dog/child/elderly parent etc.) is not something you can or should just dump!", "NTA. If he is this controlling now, can you imagine what he's going to be like once you see him longer?  This is a new relationship and he is already telling you what he won't allow. Kick his controlling ass to the curb and find a guy that takes you as is.", "NTA.  I would get rid of the boyfriend first.  \n\n3 cats the perfect number", "Is your elderly cat incontinent, a dribbler, or otherwise do things your boyfriend finds gross? Does your home smell of cat pee or just generally smell? I love cats but you've got to be realistic about the challenges when they get old, that we just put up with because they're part of the family. And the more cats you have the harder it is to not have a household that's noticeably catty.\n\nI feel like it's NAH and possibly, but not definitely, a compatibility issue between you two. It could be that the oldest cat is a bridge too far for your boyfriend, but he/she won't be around for ever. Given that actually moving together doesn't seem to be imminent, you could just wait and see. \"One is okay but three is not\" - well how about two?", "NAH.\n\nYou're simply incompatible.", "NAH.\n\nHe can't help his allergies.\n\nBut you cannot give away your companions.\n\nYou two are at a stalemate (re cohabitation, which is the only reason he gave), unless he gets allergy shots or unless you last long enough that your relationship (sorry) outlasts the cats.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
