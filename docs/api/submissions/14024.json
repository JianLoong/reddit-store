I also usually work late so I assumed she would be making healthy dinners since she\u2019s at home and she did for a couple of weeks but then she got back into buying unhealthy fast food. We spoke about this many times and she said she would try to make time and it seemed great, until I realize I had lost almost 15 lbs and she has gained 5. We had a discussion about it and she was immediately very defenses and admitted when I am not home she gets herself fast food and does not work out at all.

She should talk to someone that can help her with her unhealthy coping mechanisms, and stop blaming OP for her weight struggles.", "She's raising a baby by herself.\n\nShe takes care of all of the cooking.\n\nShe takes care of all of the cleaning - dishes (there's A LOT of bottles and other assorted baby things even if she's eating out), laundry (and there's A LOT of laundry when you have a baby), vacuuming, mopping, wiping down countertops and tables, cleaning the bathrooms, taking out trash (and there's A LOT of trash with diapers), generally picking up the house (and there's A LOT of mess especially once baby becomes mobile), dusting, potential landscaping (weeding/mowing/watering), etc.\n\nShe takes care of all of the grocery shopping and errands.\n\nShe's potentially still dealing with pumping/breastfeeding.\n\nShe's taking care of the myriad of doctor's appointments required for the baby and for her continued recovery, including transport time (including time to wrangle baby into the baby seat, once again alone).\n\nI'm guessing it's on her to take care of all of the bills and taxes.\n\nYou keep insisting she \"chose\" to be a stay at home mom, like this is something she did maliciously. Did she do it because it'd be better for the kid? Because women get paid less than men and her salary wouldn't have been enough to cover childcare? I guarantee you, if she was working a standard job, she'd be working EVEN harder because she'd have the job + ALL the other stuff, only down *a couple of hours* of nannying. You feel fine about it because the expectation of men stops at the donation of their sperm, but your wife would be pressured and guilted about choosing to be a working mom, and she'd work extra hard after work to make up for that and be there for her kid and bond with them and connect with them and try not to miss out on more than she had to. And I bet if she was working, you'd still expect her to perform all the household duties and be primary caregiver to your child. What she is doing now IS working - you sound so ungrateful to EVERYTHING she's doing that keeps your world spinning - but you'd be the AH regardless because she'd still care more about the things that matter if she was getting paid to work than you seem to care.\n\nWhen does she get a break? When does she get time to herself? When does she get to do her hobbies? Putting the kid in daycare or you \"babysitting\" is NOT a stand-in for the actual parent (YOU) bonding with and raising your child. You find time to go to the gym. I'll be nice and say your work hours are expected and not something you choose to do. Why can't you find time to *actually* be a parent or partner, just like you found time to go to the gym? Watch your own kid for an entire weekend day to give your wife the day off. Meal prep on the weekends. Clean up around the house after work and on weekends. Halve your gym time and use the rest of the time to pick up necessities. Pitch in more around the house or at least talk about hiring a maid to come help.\n\nYou do not get to slack on your duties around the house you live in, being a partner to your wife, or being a parent to your child just because you have a paying job. Those things are 24/7. You don't get any breaks. When you come home, your job is to do at least 50/50 around the house and with your kid. You don't get a break because you're \"tired\". If you're so tired, why don't you find a better job that allows you to stop taking advantage of your wife and neglecting your child?", "I agree. My friend gained so much weight post partum but the moment her husband started making extra time to take care of the baby while she had time for herself, she became so much happier and confident and started working out because she wants to, not because she was given any pressure by anyone. She is glowing now! It didn't even take an arm or a leg. Husband only needed to take the baby out of her arms for 2-3 hours every evening while she went out shopping with us (her girlfriends), took longer showers/baths, dressed up nicely, did her makeup, or just took a nap.", "And of course you get downvoted because reddit it too much \u201cdon\u2019t touch sahm\u201d", "Man I wouldn't be surprised if the reason she was gaining weight was because of all the pressure he puts on her.

OP also said his wife refuses daycare, so\u2026", "\"She doesn't help with my work\" has the unwritten addition of \"and that's why I don't do the cleaning/laundry/errands the commenter mentioned above - because that's *her* work, along with caring for the actual human child I helped create\".", "If he cared about his wife and actually wanted her to be healthier, like he claims, giving up his gym time to make healthier meals or give her a break would have been the obvious solution.

Making healthy food is hard work because it usually means preparing raw foods which takes time and is hard with a baby.

I had no concept of how little personal time I would get when I became a mom; I wouldn\u2019t expect someone who hasn\u2019t loved through it to understand either.

I don\u2019t know ask the man who apparently never gets fucking any. \n\nThe reason we point out that being stay at home Mom is work is because she is literally working the whole time that he is too, but he thinks only he gets credit for work . So when is her time off? When is her personal time? When does she get a second to herself? Sounds like he only thinks about it when he wants her to go to the gym.\n\nThe entire point of valuing work in the home is because it\u2019s a monsterous to expect a stay at home person to be doing that load every second of every day.

I know working 50-60 hrs is lots but your wife needs that time.  This could be yoga, stretching, walking, doing the peleton.  At almost 100lbs, everything will be hard and daunting.

That would make perfect sense with the fact that he's lost 15lb.", "Mate I'm not trying to be mean, but if you can't handle a newborn with two parents, it kind of sounds like you should really look into, like, classes, or professional help, because presumably, one of you will have to work eventually.", "Except she gained weight which means she\u2019s not even trying. Once again, she wanted this so he says.", "I agree. The comment I replied to has since been deleted, but that comment was asking how the OP could find the time if he worked 50-60 hours.  I did the math to show that HE had plenty of time left over in the week. In fact, on average, more hours NOT at work than working.\n\nThe math doesn't lie, OP has more than enough time left in the week to do his part.  \n\nDeleting the comment that prompted the math makes it look like I was responding to something 180\u00b0 different than I was, but if you follow to my next reply in the string, that should clarify (unless the intervening response was also deleted, in which case it might looking like I picked a weird fight with myself)", "You clearly stated you don\u2019t have kids so I\u2019m giving the benefit of the doubt that you don\u2019t know but if most child rearing falls on OPs wife, she is never going to have time to put in effort to loose weight.", "Didn\u2019t say we couldn\u2019t handle it, pal. There\u2019s a long gap between feeling tired and run thin and not being able to do something.", "From the stress of carrying most of the household and childcare duties, I\u2019d imagine.", "It's insane what high stress can do. I was at a point where there were days I couldn't physically bring myself to eat. So I'd drop pounds and pounds. And then the next time I'd eat, my body, never knowing the next time it'd get this, would pack the pounds back on as best it could, and then some if it could manage it.", "That makes so much more sense! Thanks for clarifying!", "It\u2019s not about time. One thing is not having time to go to the gym as much as husband would like. That\u2019s understandable. But she could make decisions to eat healthier. OP said she admitted to never eating healthy when he wasn\u2019t there and still pigging out on fast food.", "Yeah fair point, I retract my statement.", "I get that. My point is if this is something that she WANTS ( I put that in caps bc I don\u2019t think she wants it anymore) then she needs to find a balance. Losing weight and getting healthy is hard, but it\u2019s an imperative. Communicate with your husband that the help you need is not \u201cbabysitting\u201d ( I hate that he said that) but help with the house, etc.", "So when is she supposed to make healthy food choices when nobody else is watching the child? Do you think you can set an 8 month old down and just walk away?", "OP gives her no help. He says \u201che helps as much as he can\u201d, but also uses terms like \u201cbabysit\u201d, so I\u2019m inclined to believe he isn\u2019t nearly as helpful as he thinks he is.\n\nSo, it IS about time. She eats fast food because she doesn\u2019t have the time make meals. She doesn\u2019t go to the gym, because she doesn\u2019t have the time and she\u2019s exhausted.\n\nOP says he works a 50-60hr week. OP\u2019s wife works a 168hr week with limited help. If OP opened his eyes to the value and effort in her contribution to the household, he\u2019d (hopefully) step it up and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d become more healthy organically. Or at least, she\u2019d be more likely to live a better quality life when she isn\u2019t overwhelmed and exhausted 24/7"]}
