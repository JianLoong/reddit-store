I also usually work late so I assumed she would be making healthy dinners since she\u2019s at home and she did for a couple of weeks but then she got back into buying unhealthy fast food. We spoke about this many times and she said she would try to make time and it seemed great, until I realize I had lost almost 15 lbs and she has gained 5. We had a discussion about it and she was immediately very defenses and admitted when I am not home she gets herself fast food and does not work out at all. I know she is insecure about her body and to be honest I don\u2019t find her very attractive any more either, of course I don\u2019t say this to her face.
