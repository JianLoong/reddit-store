I struggle with depression, and feeling like a waste of space often, and that's a voice that was built, and hammered into me by my sister as a child. Not all siblings fighting is so extreme, but I've found forcing siblings who don't get along together cause they'll \"work it out\" has more so caused siblings to grow up full of resentment, and low contact to no contact, and parents hurt because their children will never see or speak to each other after they're gone. So talk to your kids about how they feel, what they are saying to each other when they fight, and how it makes them feel. My relationship with my sister improved from the space I was finally able to have from her, it took awhile of working through the built up years of resentment, but now seeing her isn't so bad, and I don't dread having to see her anymore.", "They fight about several things.
