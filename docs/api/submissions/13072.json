I've been doing my best to handle it at home, but their mother says she can't deal with it anymore at her end. She wants to split the custody so that half the weeks I have Joe and she has Sue and Tim, and half the weeks she has Joe and I have Sue and Tim. I would have to agree to this for her to change the custody order. I am against this idea for several reasons.\n\nFirst, this is unfair to Sue. She would never see her older brother anymore. The two of them get along perfectly well. Two, this is a bad lesson for the boys. They need to learn conflict resolution. Three, this is hugely inconvenient for me, because it would mess up the babysitting schedule, and I always schedule personal medical appointments and overtime at work on the weeks I don't have the kids, which would no longer exist. Four, I think she's being really lazy. I always try to run interference with the boys, and when I drop them off at school, they are usually at least at a begrudging truce.

My brother and I hated each other until I went to college. Not being \"in your face\" all the time had a _huge_ positive effect on our relationship.", "ESH. It's understandable that you don't want to split the custody as it would be inconvenient for you and unfair to Sue. However, it's also unfair to the boys to continue to expose them to constant fighting without trying to find a solution. It's important for both parents to work together to address the issue and teach the boys how to resolve conflicts. It's not productive for either of you to blame the other and refuse to compromise. You both need to prioritize the well-being of your children and work together to find a solution that works for everyone.", "NTA and you're 100% right. She's being lazy.  She signed up for this when she chose to have multiple kids. She knew or should have known there would be times when they didn't get along. She just doesn't want to do her job as a parent and figure out how deal with it. At the very least she could ask you for advice on how you do it.", "NTA. What would the kids\u2019 mum\u2019s solution be if you all lived together in the same house? Send one of the boys to live elsewhere? \n\nCustody arrangements are meant to allow you both to have time with your kids and your kids to have time with both of you you, not to use as naughty corners to separate them. The kids need to figure out how to get along but at the end of the day, siblings do fight. She won\u2019t be doing then any favours by denying them the chance to figure it out.", "NTA.", "This is really above Reddit's pay grade.

At those ages, it's not uncommon for siblings to get into it with each other - you can't just split them up to avoid those issues. Totally agree with you.\n\nI think NAH because you each have your own viewpoint, but I also agree with you that splitting custody is not the solution here.", "I don't think I can judge this. If things are bad enough that your ex is suggesting permanently separating the kids, I think we need to consider the possibility that this might be no ordinary sibling rivalry. What does your ex say happens when they fight around her (which may be different from what happens when they fight around you)?", "Nta. For every reason you already listed. Stand your ground on this.", "NTA, this is not the way to deal with this situation.. I have to wonder what you're ex would've suggested if you were still together??", "NTA, but I think you and you ex should sit down and chat, and come up with a plan. Maybe get a few brochures of boarding schools for troubled kids. Let them both know that their fighting ends one way or another. You don't have to honestly consider boarding schools, but the thought might be enough to end the bickering.", "NTA. Siblings fight. That's no reason to split custody of them.", "NTA.  Family counseling is in order, not a snap decision to separate your daughter from one of her brothers.", "INFO. I don't see any mention of what your kids want or how they've told you they feel about this.\n\nWhen I was a child about your kids' age, I also had a weekly A/B schedule like you're describing for your kids, and it was really rough on me in ways that I didn't recognize until later. When I was 11, I put my foot down and insisted on a change (it wasn't really intentional or thought-out... I was just sick of switching all the damned time, so I stopped), and I was better for it.", "NTA. This is so isolating for Joe. You all need to come together as a family to do some serious conflict resolution because this is the definition of sweeping it under the rug and pretending the problem doesn\u2019t exist.", "NTA... But OP... maybe consider NOT giving you eldest clothes to your younger son. Period. Even if he's outgrown them. Until your older son is ready to give it up.", "NTA. It's a crazy idea.", "NTA...It's reasons like this that we have custody agreements.  Your ex is going to have to actually parent.", "INFO - You mentioned two other kids, when are they around?

This is a horrible suggestion on her part.", "NTA unless they\u2019re a threat to each other there\u2019s no need to split them up. \n\ni do want to point out though - what do you expect your wife to do when they\u2019re fighting? sometimes the best way for them to learn is to let them work the problem out themselves since they\u2019re old enough to speak to each other.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They are going to a school that is 10 mins down the road from my ex's work. She just got a new job and I've been picking them up and bringing them to my place for her to pick up on the way home (about 10mins out of her way). This is 90 mins out of my day I don't get to bill out and lose vs her taking a late lunch and picking them up.\n\nThey've both complained that I refuse to drop our child off at her work because the 10 mins to pick them up when she is off is an inconvenience for the mother.\n\nYou do what is best for your children. Period. Your ex's inconvenience is not your concern.", "NTA - all of your reasons are completely valid for not changing the time-sharing, and up-ending the schedule should be the last option in my opinion, only after EVERYTHING else has been attempted.  It's a hard age for the kids, with Joe being in middle school and the other 2 being in elementary, so Joe probably feels like Tim's a baby and doesn't want to hang out with him.  Which is normal.\n\nMaybe your ex should try putting the boys into therapy or something?

What I do is that I separate them and talk to them one at a time. I ask them to tell me why they are so upset. I then acknowledge their frustration, which helps them calm down.
