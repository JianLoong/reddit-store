As her friends, we are excited about the wedding; we already paid for dresses (I am one of the bridesmaids) and held the bridal shower and bachelorette party in February, which I paid for most of it; they also asked me to donate the cake for the wedding because it was out of their budget, which I complied, and everything is set.\n\nUntil something unexpected happened, my grandma passed away a few weeks before the wedding. It was a devastating time for me because I am very close with my grandma. When I called Rae to tell her that my grandma had passed, she just asked,\"**You're** **still attending my wedding, right?Like, this is the most important day of my life!**\"I was stunned that that was the first thing Rae said after I told her the news; after that, she never texted or called. Rae called me again to ask if I was going to the wedding. I said no because her wedding and my grandma's funeral are on the same day, and it will bring her bad luck if my family attends the wedding after the funeral( one of the few superstitions that my family strictly follows) but we can be at the reception. A week before, she demanded we \"switch\" my grandma's funeral and her wedding (it's at the same church), but I told her that we couldn't do that because the church is the one who schedules the funeral.\n\nShe just yelled at me, \"But **it's my wedding! How can you miss my wedding?**\" I looked at her confused, then slowly said,\"It's. **my. grandma's. funeral.**\" She stomped away like the child she is and looked for her fiance. Later that night, she tagged me in her post/rant about how I ruined her wedding, that I'm not her real friend because I won't attend, that she wasted her effort on me, and that I'm not welcome to her wedding anymore; and she shouldn't have paid for me. PAY FOR WHAT?! Mind you, I paid for almost half of it. I catered to the requests she made because she's my friend. I screenshotted her post before she could delete it, and I showed it to my parents and told them about what happened. They were livid because Rae didn't even show an ounce of sympathy and pressured me to choose. So my parents told me to refund the deposit for the dresses, make-up, and gifts and cancel the cake, which I did.\n\nShe called me furious. \"**You B, what have you done?!

You really expect her to cry her heart out on a funeral, then go dance at some wedding a few hours later? Even if she did go to the wedding, do you really think she would be in the mood to be happy for her ignorant friend who literally didn't show an ounce of sympathy for someone's death? Like literally explain to me how it's a horrible thing that she's grieving for her grandma's death. She prioritized the funeral over the wedding because she had to.

Stop being this insensitive.", "Lying on the internet, I\u2019m shocked I tell you!", "It happens. My dad's funeral was after 6 weeks"]}
