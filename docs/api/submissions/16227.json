We were shocked when she told us because she was so young back then, and settling down that young is not really common where I live.She just got married last April. As her friends, we are excited about the wedding; we already paid for dresses (I am one of the bridesmaids) and held the bridal shower and bachelorette party in February, which I paid for most of it; they also asked me to donate the cake for the wedding because it was out of their budget, which I complied, and everything is set.\n\nUntil something unexpected happened, my grandma passed away a few weeks before the wedding. It was a devastating time for me because I am very close with my grandma. When I called Rae to tell her that my grandma had passed, she just asked,\"**You're** **still attending my wedding, right?Like, this is the most important day of my life!**\"I was stunned that that was the first thing Rae said after I told her the news; after that, she never texted or called. Rae called me again to ask if I was going to the wedding. I said no because her wedding and my grandma's funeral are on the same day, and it will bring her bad luck if my family attends the wedding after the funeral( one of the few superstitions that my family strictly follows) but we can be at the reception. A week before, she demanded we \"switch\" my grandma's funeral and her wedding (it's at the same church), but I told her that we couldn't do that because the church is the one who schedules the funeral.\n\nShe just yelled at me, \"But **it's my wedding! How can you miss my wedding?**\" I looked at her confused, then slowly said,\"It's. **my. grandma's. funeral.**\" She stomped away like the child she is and looked for her fiance. Later that night, she tagged me in her post/rant about how I ruined her wedding, that I'm not her real friend because I won't attend, that she wasted her effort on me, and that I'm not welcome to her wedding anymore; and she shouldn't have paid for me. PAY FOR WHAT?! Mind you, I paid for almost half of it. I catered to the requests she made because she's my friend. I screenshotted her post before she could delete it, and I showed it to my parents and told them about what happened. They were livid because Rae didn't even show an ounce of sympathy and pressured me to choose. So my parents told me to refund the deposit for the dresses, make-up, and gifts and cancel the cake, which I did.\n\nShe called me furious. \"**You B, what have you done?! You ruined my** **wedding**! **How could you cancel everything?**\" I told her that since it was her wedding, she should pay for it. \n\nMy parents,some of my friends and relatives agreed to what I did but  Rae and her side  especially those who didn't pay for anything keeps calling me an ahole for doing what I did.

You really expect her to cry her heart out on a funeral, then go dance at some wedding a few hours later? Even if she did go to the wedding, do you really think she would be in the mood to be happy for her ignorant friend who literally didn't show an ounce of sympathy for someone's death? Like literally explain to me how it's a horrible thing that she's grieving for her grandma's death. She prioritized the funeral over the wedding because she had to. It's not like she dipped from the wedding and retracted her funds because she hated the friend, it was a consequence of the bride being selfish.

It depends on the schedule of the priest in charge. They can hold several funerals in the morning and weddings in the afternoon or vice versa. \n\n\nLastly,the superstitions.

But that does not have to be the mourning process for every person in the US.", "I have been to 3 funerals in the past 9 months. From death to funeral they were 1 1/2 months, 2 months and a month. Not all are held the following week due to a host of reasons.", "I find the post fishy too. But not because of the funeral thing.\n\nI think it\u2019s definitely a cultural thing that funerals are held immediately after death. But there are groups of people who hold a funeral, which is really what I was defined as a week or a memorial weeks or months after the death of a loved one due to their cultural beliefs. \n\nSo, just to be fair to OP, since we don\u2019t actually know, the culture OP was raised in, this could be entirely that. There are religions that don\u2019t value the corpse of a deceased loved one. Therefore, the funeral does not rely on the body being embalmed, and what not. And it\u2019s really not that uncommon for me personally to hear about funeral/memorial services being held well after someone has passed.\n\nAnd as a lot of people say, the funerals are for those live, and not the dead. And since OP was not the one hosting the funeral and planning it, they didn\u2019t determine the timeline. A lot of people struggle with the passing of their parents so maybe the people planning the funeral didn\u2019t have it in them to face the final goodbye until now. Funerals can be complex things to plan \n\nBut also people don\u2019t have a choice about how fast are loved ones getting embalmed. They don\u2019t have a choice always about the timing and when places can fit them in as well.\n\nEdit: I also just realized that is Dorr going to put bodies in the ground very quickly because they would go bad and wrong. We have freezers in the modern day. So you don\u2019t need to shut the body in the ground before you\u2019re ready to deal with your grief. You can just freeze it until you\u2019re ready to face the final goodbye", "OK I said this in multiple places but these kind of calm it\u2019s kind of annoying me I\u2019m sorry, but I do have to you\n\nBut there are cultures even within the United States, where people don\u2019t immediately bury their dead. In my own personal background people call a funeral, what is technically awake or memorial service. And it does not involve a dead body or waiting for a dead body to be embalmed or shoved in the ground. And it\u2019s very calm and not unheard of for me to hear a funerals are held well after the person has passed mainly because he does not involve the body. \n\nAt least in the United States, I definitely know were very Catholic heavy country. We also have strong roots to Angelican. But those are not the only types of morning traditions that exist, nor have been developed throughout time. But I\u2019m pretty certain these are the religious cultures that dominate the country I live in so that\u2019s why I like people are saying what\u2019s wrong with OP\u2019s morning to grab traditions\n\nAnother thought I had just now is that we have freezers. Historically bodies need to be put in the ground immediately or they would go bad. You can just freeze a body until the family is ready to face the grief and loss of a loved one. Not everyone is ready to face shoving their loved one in the ground immediately after death within weeks or days.", "Do you guys also do like 9 days of praying", "You let her off easy!
