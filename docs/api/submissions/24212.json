This isn't something a 15 YO should have to explain to adults. This is something adults explain to adults and not in a first meet. I think the bio parents meet her parents first. Then OP's parents can meet with her parents for an adult only meeting at another time. If OP's parents don't understand that their arrangement is not usual and has to be handled delicately, they're living in in a fantasy world.", "NTA. You're 15. Your parents are being huge AHs by pretending they don't understand why you aren't presenting them all to the world. But you shouldn't lie to GF's parents. Tell her to tell them. They may decline meeting your parents. That's OK. Better than lying.", "NTA, you shouldn't have to be judged by other's choices. It's your parents' choice to be in a policule, not yours. \nThey know that the majority of society would be judgmental about their choice. Why do they want to force that on their child. They should be\u2078\n understanding about this ask. \nAs a parent, they should know that their child just wants to be accepted and doesn't want to be the \"weird one\" in school. \nIt may hurt your 3rd parent but that's what he signed up for.", "NTA you are fifteen! You will have to be open about this someday to your partners parents but today doesn't need to be that day. Being 15 and dating is hard enough", "NAH. I get why your second dad is hurt, and I get why this is a weird situation for you, and I get why your girlfriend doesn't want to deal with her parents freaking out (they're def AHs if they can't just be polite about tho). And your parents aren't wrong that dating someone who can't handle your family probably won't work out in the long term -- but I would tell them this is a two month high school relationship, you're not betrothed to be wed and I can see why the viability of two family harmony isn't the first thing on your mind when considering compatibility. I think they also are maybe a little naive/optimistic about how easy it is for you to be open about it -- and they should be proud that you generally are to your friends etc!", "NAH.  Not you, your parents or your GF.\n\nClearly you GF\u2019s parents are another matter, but they have been arseholes\u2026..yet.\n\nYou face an incredibly difficult and daunting situation.\n\nI\u2019m not sure that your GF\u2019s parents will forgive you once they find out the truth.   They will take double offence for sure,  they are unlikely to approve of your parents\u2019 lifestyle, and the fact that you have lied to them.   \n\nLying to them not only postpones potential conflict but will likely exacerbate it \n\nI don\u2019t envy your situation at all; and I\u2019m very cautious advising you further. \n\nI feel sorry for non-bio dad, but you are not trying to hurt him.     Nobody in your family deserves to be in this position, and neither does your GF.    \n\nI hope you get some useful perspectives from redditors who post after me, and I wish you all the best in finding the best way to deal with this.", "Tough one because you have a valid reason for your feelings but starting off any relationship (in this case first parent meeting) with a lie is a big red flag down the road. Perhaps as others have mentioned you could give them somewhat of a heads up? Better preparation might ease the tension of you feeling like you have offended one of your parents without meaning too. \n\nIf they are in the loop about the overall dynamic of your parents relationship, at the least, you don\u2019t have to lie about it and at the worst they can express their feelings right off the bat and you\u2019ll know immediately where they stand. They could be traditional but open-minded. They could also find it strange but think your a good match for their daughter and really take to you. \n\nBut whatever you decide not letting them in on the family makeup won\u2019t age well\u2026\n\nI\u2019m torn!", "Maybe a little asshole, why bother with the ruse to begin with? Her parents might not like nontraditional families, but I know they don't like being lied to. \nMaybe your girlfriend should be more concerned about hiding her parents' bigotry? \nYou could have been more considerate of your father's feelings, but I wouldn't stress too much on that. \n\nJust don't bother lying it won't help anything in the long run.", "NTA and it's not your or your  gf's fault her parents are conservative. Your parents should be used to judgement, they shouldn't guilt trip you over it. \n\nDaddy is making it about him like a baby. It's your 1st gf, they should give U a break. Lots of fully grown adults would find it challenging \u2014 only because people and society are overwhelmingly judgemental about anything outside of the societal norm , and judgements can have real world consequences", "I\u2019m going to go NAH because really it\u2019s society\u2019s fault that deem some things unacceptable which has led to this situation.\n\nI guess I find the whole thing strange but it doesn\u2019t seem to be inherently bad. Maybe things are starting to be more progressive but it\u2019s not necessarily any individual\u2019s fault here.", "INFO: Do you actually love the other man like a parent and consider him to be a parent to you or is it just something you\u2019ve had to deal with and tolerate because of the situation but you don\u2019t look at him as one of your parents?", "Gentle YTA.\n\nThis can\u2019t be the first time you all have had to navigate this type of situation. What did you tell friends when you invite them over? What do they tell teachers and other parents?\n\nBy now your parents are either comfortable with people knowing or have an explanation already in hand. That would suggest this wasn\u2019t about not knowing what to do - it was about prioritizing the feelings of your girlfriend\u2019s parents over those of yours.", "YTA, mild only because you're a teenager. \n\nYour parents are your parents, and it reads like you have a good relationship with all of them. That is incredibly valuable. It might be easier short term to lie about your family, but there are only two long-term outcomes here:\n\nOption A) You and your girlfriend eventually break up, and you'll have hurt your third parent's feelings for no reason.\n\nOption B) You and your girlfriend stay together forever, in which case you have then the option to B.1) have to come clean eventually, possibly alienating girlfriend's parents that much more, or B.2) keep up the lie, continuously hurting your third parent (and also your other two parents let's be real), creating ongoing tension.\n\nIf your girlfriend loves you for who you really are, she'll accept your family. If your girlfriend's parents love her like parents should, they'll only care that you make her happy. \n\nBonus, if you're honest about it from the start, the guilt you feel for hiding/hurting your third parent's feelings will not weigh down your relationship with your girlfriend. Honesty is the way to go here.", "NTA do what makes you feel most comfortable bro thats what matters at the end of the day dating is already a struggle and this will throw in a whole other layer of complication that isn\u2019t necessary.", "Eh YTA or NAH is the answer.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't hide your family because her parents are judgmental.  You're acting like you're ashamed of them.  If her parents don't like it that's on them.  NAH/slight Y T A.", "I really think this hits the nail on the head. I just want to echo that it's worth telling your parents that this is a 2 month highschool relationship. \n\nYou're not an adult engaged to this person, and while I absolutely get where your parents are coming from, I also think it's normal and healthy for you to be able to explore romantic interests without having to manage the social impacts of theirs.", "Of course I love like one of my parents,  He's my other dad", "bruh lol", "That\u2019s good to hear. He\u2019s hurt, he probably is worried you don\u2019t love him as much or the same as your other two parents. It\u2019s gotta be a lot raising a kid together as 3 when two actually get to claim biological relation. He\u2019s likely worried before that you don\u2019t see him the same.\n\nIdk if I\u2019d go so far as to say you\u2019re an asshole for this, but I personally firmly believe dating is for finding an eventual partner for marriage (unlike hooking up, FWB, etc.) and if that\u2019s the case her parents are going to eventually know. I don\u2019t think there is much purpose in hiding it. I think you should just be up front. I get why he\u2019s hurt in feeling that you\u2019re hiding him, even though I do get your reasoning", "In that case, YTA. If you consider him to be one of your parents, then you need to treat him accordingly. If your girlfriend\u2019s parents have an issue with your family situation it\u2019s THEIR issue, not yours.", "Than YTA if you love him like your father, introduced him like your father if you don\u2019t consider him one of your parents, don\u2019t introduce them as your parents, but you\u2019re intending to stay with this partner for the foreseeable future at some point her parents are going to figure out your uncommon parentage so either you get ahead of it and be honest, or you lie, and you hurt people.", "It's his issue if her parents then don't let her date him anymore.  Things like that happen \n\nHe's not on trial for not loving his parents enough, he already said he loves them equally. Only his parents are responsible for their relationship decisions, not OP. He's just a kid having his 1st sweetheart and suddenly he's got obligations and scrutiny because his parents have an unconventional arrangement of their own making. Daddy needs to grow up and realise that hurt feelings are part of life and think how hurt OP will feel if his gf conservative parents ban her from seeing him"]}
