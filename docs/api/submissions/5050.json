So NTA\n\nedit: and btw, your sister is the one ruining the holiday with her irresponsible pet ownership choices", "Why doesn't she just put them in a room like she wanted you to do with your cat?\n\nOh right, because they're giant animals and would likely destroy the room and may also destroy your house.

I wouldn't trust a badly trained (breaking crates = inadequate training) dog that big around a cat or a baby - sure, it probably won't but it's definitely physically capable of doing so very very quickly.", "I don't do that with my children and they are humans. \n\nIf someone just showed up with their dog I'd be pissed. \n\nAlso, I work in an emergency room (for humans) and we've had people try to bring in their dogs.

And I say that as a dog owner who doesn't feel entitled to bring my anxiously-attached dog everywhere.", "That's really unfortunate, I'm sorry to hear that happened :(", "I just posted similar about huskies and their prey drive. They can be absolutely sweet, but...", "Honestly, it depends how much you want to visit the other people. My dog sleeps in our room and would be miserable if we tried to leave him downstairs in a strange place.

Not used to be around cats this can escalate pretty quickly.", ">The OP has demonstrated a willingness to put her cat in the room in the past.\n\nYou misread the post. OP says that the cat hides in the bedroom, not that OP puts the cat there. \n\nI think you're also willfully ignoring the difference between the dogs. Two small dogs are unlikely to pose a large threat to the cat. I don't know if the small dogs have been around cats before and OP knows how they would react, as she makes a point of mentioning how sister's dogs have not, but I can see how OP wouldn't be too worried about the cat's safety if the dogs are the same size or even smaller than the cat-maybe the cat can hide in a tall place the dogs cannot reach. \n\nBut big dogs are completely different, especially when you don't know beforehand how they'll react to a cat. It's not as simple as saying \"well put the cat in the bedroom and close and lock the door.\" What if the dogs keep trying to scratch at the door and damage the wood? What if they go crazy and actually try to slam open the door? OP says in a comment that they broke through their crates-frankly, I wouldn't risk them trying that with a door.", "I don't think this is really an issue about the dog being in the bedroom though, I think it's just an issue about the dog being in the house in general which is an entirely different request. Also sometimes pets have to be told no, just like children. They might be upset in the moment but they forget about it pretty quickly in my experience.", "Whether she puts the cat in the bedroom or if it goes their on its own, I think that is the splitting of hairs. The point is this: she allows her parents to bring their dogs because the cat is able to avoid them by going into the room. \n\nAssuming that the room has a door, there is no reason why the cat won\u2019t be just as safe even if the dogs are larger.", ">Whether she puts the cat in the bedroom or if it goes their on its own, I think that is the splitting of hairs.\n\nNo, it's not, if your argument is \"OP should be willing to do for sister what she does for her parents.\" OP lets the cat have free roam of the house when the parent's dogs are there, but the cat is the one who chooses to hide. So by your own logic, if OP wants to treat them equally, then OP should allow the cat to free roam the house when sister's dogs are there. But no responsible cat owner is going to do that, nor should they have to. \n\n>Assuming that the room has a door, there is no reason why the cat won\u2019t be just as safe even if the dogs are larger.\n\nDid you miss where I said the dogs broke their crates? Yeah, a door is (hopefully) stronger, but a responsible pet owner is not going to risk it. Large dogs, especially two of them, absolutely can break down a door, depending on how thick it is, what it's made of, how big and strong the dogs are, how much they want to get in, etc. Can you tell me there is a 100% guarantee that something like that isn't going to happen?\n\nI also noticed how you didn't mention anything about the dogs scratching on the door or anything. So what do you have to say about that? Who would be responsible for the damages if the dogs scratched the door, or ran into it and caused it to dent or something?
