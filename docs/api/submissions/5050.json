The dog\u2019s separation anxiety is something she needs to work on with it, and it isn\u2019t on you to shove your cat in a bedroom so she can perpetuate her dog\u2019s undesirable behavior.", "NTA\n\nI'm seeing in the comments that both these big dogs have enough behavior issues to be breaking out of crates, which is.. I can't even fathom how you get there if you're taking care of your dogs. Separation anxiety also needs to be addressed, not just catered to. \n\nHonestly I would consider your cat to be in danger in this scenario. Good luck with the holidays, sorry you're dealing with this", "NTA\n\nYour house, your rules, and you have no idea how these dogs will react to a home that has a cat. Not even interacting with it, but even just the smell of 'cat'. Nor do you know how they'll react to being in your home specifically (are they allowed on furniture at home? Even without a cat, would you accept large dogs on furniture in *your* home?)\n\nDoggy daycare exists for a reason, and if the shepherd has such severe separation anxiety that it can not spend a day without its human, that should be addressed as well. After all, what would your sister do in the event of an emergency?", "NTA and don\u2019t let her bring the dogs", "NTA\n\nWhy is her dog more important than your cat?  Why are her needs more important than yours? You reply that you said you\u2019d prefer them not to bring the dogs. If that is what you said, next time be more blunt. No, they ask again, no that doesn\u2019t work for us.\n\nAlso, my friend had a cat who was similar with dogs, they got talked into letting the dogs come and the cat stay in the room. The cat scratched at the door the entire time the dog was there , meowed, tried to get the paw under the door. After an hour my friend told their family they needed to leave or remove the dog. Family did, but not without saying it\u2019s only a cat, it will be fine. When they left, the cat could smell the dog and really didn\u2019t like it and ended up spraying in the room, cat never did this before.\n\nPoint is , it\u2019s your house, your cat, your rules. \n\nIf they are ok with the dogs being crated and in the garage and you\u2019re ok with that, offer it.", "Absolutely NTA.

That\u2019s your cats home.", "NTA - If the dog doesn't like being alone,  your sister can hire someone to sit with the dog while they are visiting you. (BTW, what is her excuse for the second dogn that doesn't have anxiety, Why does she think that dog should invade your cat's home?)", "NTA, and you never have to compromise when it comes to what you're willing to accept at your house. More appropriate solutions would be for (i) your sister to hire a sitter to come take care of her dog with separation anxiety, (ii) your parents to delay the kitchen remodel so they can host with all of the dogs, (iii) your parents to host and cater the dinner, or (iv) have Christmas at a restaurant. But do not apologize and do not back down. \n\n(While you're at it, tell your parents that their yap dogs are not allowed in your space anymore either.)", "NTA, why is she ruining the holiday over a dog?", "NTA. Your house, your rules. Her dogs anxiety isn\u2019t worth your cats potential death.

The dog is your sister's and it is solely her responsibility. She needs to figure out a solution for her dog that doesn't involve violating your boundaries. She has plenty of options like putting the dog in a kennel for the day.", "NTA the cat lives there all of the time, the dog doesn\u2019t. The dog comes second after the cat. The dog stays behind, and can be visited by your sister during the day.\n\nEasy-peasy", "NTA. This is why crate training exists for dogs. She can crate her dogs and they won't be able to destroy anything in their anxiety. If she has a big enough vehicle, she can assemble an away-crate in the car and leave the dog in that.", "NTA. Even if your cat chooses to be in the bedroom because people are there (mine would) it's not right to expect your cat to get stressed or worse. These are large dogs who haven't been around cats. They could hurt your cat even if all they wanted to do is play.", "NTA.\n\nNo, your house, your rules. Your cats, their home and safe place. You have no obligation to cater for anyone else. My dog is my whole world but if I can\u2019t bring her somewhere, I won\u2019t. Especially to someone\u2019s home. You\u2019re NTA, they are. I hope you\u2019re holidays get better.", "NTA. They're entitled asf. Your house, your rules. Change YOUR safespace because she wants her damn dog there? Not giving a shit about your boundaries? Absolutely the fuck not! They'd be lucky to be invited back into my home at all after that kind of disrespect.", "NTA. She needs to work on her dog\u2019s separation anxiety and stop making it everyone else\u2019s problem. Tell her to get them proper crates they cannot break out of and some toys to help entertain them while they\u2019re out. She made the choice to get animals. Training is part of that.", "NTA - She blames you for ruining christmas over a cat but conveniently forgets her part ruining her own day over her dog. Your rule was pretty clear to begin with. She asked, you said no, end of the story imo.", "NTA. Your house your rules.", "NTA at all.  I would not welcome two large dogs with high natural prey drives in my home with smaller pets.  Especially if one or more have separation anxiety. Both of her dogs will be just fine in a boarding facility.  If it\u2019s acceptable to you maybe the dogs could be the ones locked in a garage but if they are used to the separation anxiety being reinforced by never having to ever be alone your garage will probably be destroyed.", "NTA your house your rules. Her dogs anxiety is not your problem", "NTA. I love dogs. I train them and work with them everyday. I have a pittie that lives with a cat and is gentle. She is well trained and listens to my commands. If OP asked me to leave her at home, I would. No questions asked.\n\nIt's your house, your rules.

I do think that OP needs to ban the yappers from the house, too.  \n\nWhat I am saying is that the cat will know that the dogs on the other side of the door are just like the ones who terrorized her in her old home.  I have a husky, and I have to deadbolt the door when he is in the yard because he can open the door and leave it open.  So, I know that a husky can break into the room and chase the cat, jump on the bed to get to the cat, jump from the bed to the dresser to get to the cat, push through the closet door to get to the cat, and all kinds of other mayhem.  I also know that the cat is injured or dead when the dog catches the cat.  \n\nSo, locking the cat up for the small dogs is not the same as locking them up for the big ones.", "I'm aware, but OP can tell their sister.
