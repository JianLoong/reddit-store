It doesn\u2019t really matter because regardless of age, your SIL is a major AH, but she\u2019s setting the example by which they will follow.  Her sense of entitlement is shocking. Worse, she stole the toys, which is passing the entitlement onto her kids. \n\nYou should not let this go.

I think what's important here is that your kid had a really nice, sensible impulse where everyone wins. That's the kind of thinking the whole world should applaud and encourage. The kind of thinking we want in future leaders. Crushing that so young is awful. SIL didn't just take the toys, she took the nice feeling of sharing and knowing people were having nice experiences because of something they thought of. She took the idea that people respect generosity. She took the idea of justice. She basically told a child that if you're nice and openly offer people an inch, they will spit on you and take a mile.
