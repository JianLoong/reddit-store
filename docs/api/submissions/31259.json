If SIL wants free toys she has to ask for free toys, not steal from the shared toy closet at grandparents house. This level of entitlement is nasty!", "NTA\n\nThose toys were there for ALL the grandkids to play with and were not meant to be taken.\nI would absolutely demand that those toys be returned.", "YWNBTA\nYour SIL took the toys without permission. She is refusing to return them. That's theft. Having said that, your SIL is likely going to be pissed anyways.", "NTA, but can your husband talk to his brother about it?", "NTA, but don't put yourself in the line of fire. This is your husband's sibling. He should take the lead in all communication in this attempt to get the stolen toys back.", "(edit: YWNBTA based on your response that SIL stole them)\n\nInfo: did your inlaws tell your SIL she can't keep them? \n\nMy response would vary dependent on that information. \n\nOf your inlaws never told your SIL no, than this is when you explain to your kids that once you give someone something they can regift it. Gifts are things we let go of. And donations to places means they belong to the place. It sucks and it hurts but now we know we can't leave things and grandma and grandpa's and anything we give to Grandma and Grandpa may be things they regift. \n\nIf your in laws did tell your SIL no, than you are in the clear. Because your SIL stole things and then refused to return them.", "At the very least she and the kids should refill grandma and grandpa's toy closet!", "No, you will not be the ass- your sil is though. Tell her plainly that your kids left their toys there to be there to play with when visiting the grandparents, and we\u2019re fine with sharing with their cousins. That is the truth. She needs to bring the toys back, as they still belong to your kids. And the grandparents probably misunderstood why your kids brought them over. \nShe taught you that she is willing to take whatever you bring over to the grandparents, so now you know not to ever do it again.", "NTA. It was pretty presumptive for them to take the toys home with them. However, if I were in your shoes I\u2019d pause and assess how important it is to you. It sounds like your SIL is a major grudge holder so it\u2019s worth asking if the drama this will inevitably stir up is a good use of your one precious life. Are the toys/the principle of the matter/your kids level of investment worth all the time and trouble you\u2019ll have to devote to getting them back and the backlash from them and potentially the rest of the family? Only you can answer that. Once you decide and if you\u2019re ready to rumble, go for it.", "eh, I don't want to say YTA, because it's clear SIL is TA here. With that said, you gave the toys to your MIL. It's no longer up to you what happens to the toys. For you to message SIL to ask her to return them would be overstepping. Maybe you can instead help MIL write a message to SIL asking her to return them as they were not hers to take.", "YTA. It's not cool for your sister-in-law to just take the toys without asking. Your kids were generous and wanted to share with their cousins, and now they're hurt. It's completely reasonable for you to ask for the toys to be returned.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't ask, advise her that they belong to your children who kindly took the to the grandparents house so her kids could also enjoy using them when they visit however at no stage where you asked if you would mind them keeping them.  Now you want them returned.\n\nWOuld SIL appreciate if you kids decided they liked something that belongs to her kids and they just took it. I'm guessing not.", "YWNBTA - Maybe you can tell SIL that those are her kids next few years XMAS and birthday gifts. This is also on your in-laws for having the spines of jellyfish.", "NTA, You absolutely have a right to ask her to return your children\u2019s toys but \u2026. If asking your sister-in-law to do so is going to create a major rift in the family, and it kind of sounds like it might, then, perhaps it would be better to let her keep them. Those toys can now be thought of as gifts to her children, any future toys that go to the grandparents house should have your children\u2019s names on them, or should come home with them after each visit. If the grandparents need toys for the toy closet, then they can purchase them. Then it\u2019s up to them to deal with sister-in-law. You shouldn\u2019t have to tiptoe around SIL but sometimes it\u2019s just easier to take the high road.", "NTA - your SIL had no right to take them in the first place", "NTA", "NTA. Those toys weren\u2019t hers to take home. She\u2019s a thief.", "Nope. Your mother and father in law are for allowing their daughter to take all of the toys home with her. Your sister in law is for stealing all of the toys you brought to your in law\u2019s house. Someone needs to stand up to this very special person and set her straight. Those are not her toys, they\u2019re yours.", "My in-laws didn\u2019t tell her she could take them. They didn\u2019t even know they were gone as she must have snuck them out of their house. \n\nThey asked if she took them, then asked if she was bringing them back, she said \u201cno.\u201d And they are afraid to anger her by asking for them back.", "I'm guessing you skipped over the party where MIL said they didn't know where the toys were and then contacted SIL about the missing toys and also asked the SIL when she'd be returning them.", "I know. It\u2019s a hard one. I do agree that we did give them away and I explained to my children that not everybody takes care of toys like we do. So things could get drawn on or be messy. They just said they would clean it if it got that way. They just didn\u2019t expect them to be completely gone. \n\nI am torn. Thank you for the honest feedback.", "You voted Y T A when N T A seems more like what you meant.", "YWNBTA- but also you're not likely to win this fight. She stole them. She admits she stole them. Grandma and Grandpa won't say anything to her... And she's not bringing back the toys. \n\nIt's a hard thing for your kids to learn and it hurts... But this is when they learn that not everyone is generous. It's important to share but sometimes when we share things they get broken, lost or taken. They will be okay and we just don't leave things at grandmas and Grandpa's if we're not ready to let go of them.", "I'd ask but be prepared for drama.", "I asked if they said that she could keep the toys. They didn't then respond 'okay, keep the toys\" to her refusal to bring them back. Which is what sounded like may have happened.", "If you generally give Christmas gifts to these people I would suggest buying your kids extra toys instead of presents for that side of the family. And if they ask point out they took their gifts early and since they can\u2019t share they don\u2019t get extra presents. \n\nAnd since your parents in law have no spine, I\u2019d never take anything nice over there again. They blatantly enable their child to be an asshole with no regards to others suffering the consequences.", "It doesn't suggest any of that. They asked if they would be returned and she texted back\"no.\" There is no indication that anything else was said and regardless, she took them without permission.", "Given that grandma and grandpa \"won't say anything out of fear\" I'm pretty sure they could easily have just said \"okay.... Sure keep them\" out of that same fear.", "I understood where you were going with it. They have told her to just do whatever in the past with other things. For sure not this time though.", "The best angle I can see this going to is telling your SIL that you're super excited she's going to buy new toys for the toy closet at Grandma and Grandpa's... Because obviously she wouldn't just empty the toy closet and take everything and not fill it back up. You and the kids are looking forward to seeing all the cool things she fills it with.", "Or OP could just be honest and tell them that those toys belong to their kids and they were left at grandma and grandpa's so that they would have toys to play with there. He kids are welcome to play with them at grandma and grandpa's, but they need to be returned.", "Sure they could... Which is not going to happen, but absolutely they could just go \"return the toys, they aren't yours and they belong to my kids who keep them at Grandma and Grandpas\".... Which is still going to result in a no."]}
