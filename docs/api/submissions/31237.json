The kid was with some of his friends trying to look cool and proceeded to call me a fat ass in front of everyone. \n\nAgain I'm in recovery and I have been under a lot of stress and something just broke in me and I went absolutely crazy. I was screaming and hollering and telling him to go to hell. I called him out for all the food he's been stealing and I told him I'd get the police involved if he ever tried that shit again.

Hopefully he at least got the point. But he was stealing, and then basically rubbed the fact you didn't do anything about it before in your face to impress his friends.\n\nBut ten is young, y'know? I guess I'll just not vote.", "Fuck around and find out. Much better he gets this mental kick now than getting hurt for real later on. NTA", "NTA he assaulted you. Should you have been calmer? Probably. I get it, he\u2019s a kid with a tough life. But that\u2019s not an excuse for his behavior.", "NTA. He probably felt like you were a push over cos you\u2019ve let him steal food. He was clearly trying to show off to his mates believing you\u2019d just shrug it off but had you let him get away with it he would have continued to escalate.\n\nScreaming at him might not have been the best option but hopefully he got the message and won\u2019t take the piss again.", "Nta he sounds like a little shit", "i understand the frustration at the child and yes he was being very disrespectful but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate or ok to scream at a child like that.", "NTA. There is a reason why most jurisdictions around the world provide ample leeway to prosecute kids aged 10-14 for indictable crimes. \n\nAs a law student who has seen first hand the plethora of 10-12 year olds getting done for criminal offenses during my countless hours of work placements, these kids aren\u2019t as naive as most people think. A lot of the cases I saw, the prosecution easily proved intent and that\u2019s all that matters.\n\nThis little shit just couldn\u2019t handle the heat and ran away like a coward when things turned for the worse for him. I don\u2019t accept for a second that this kid didn\u2019t understand the potential consequences of his actions. \n\nThe repeated behavior shows us all we need to know.", "NTA.

My daughter is 13, my nephew is 12, and my oldest niece is 11, so they were all 10 not too long ago.\n\nMy daughter had a kid call her a b*tch at that age just because he could.....\n\nThey know what they're doing, and they're not dumb. Sure, life is hard at that age because \"all my friends are doing x, why shouldn't I?\"", "NTA - That kid is a little shit and is fully aware of what he is doing is wrong. He was throwing shit at you and you had a reaction, albeit a strong one, but someone had to", "NTA. Hopefully the little shit starts to realise that actions have consequences.", "NTA better he learn that his behavior is unacceptable now rather than later when he would just end up in jail for it. 10 is old enough to know not to throw shit at people.", "Yeesh. The kid shouldn't have called you names or stolen from the gas station. You shouldn't have lost it on him. I'm gonna say that no one here is an asshole. The kid most definitely caved in to peer pressure and you just reached your boiling and unfortunately things happened the way they did. Just live and learn, my dude.", "Hey bud, looking at your behavior is part of your recovery. You helped this boy out and he didn\u2019t realize you knew, he assumed you were dumb actually. You did snap and there are consequences for this boy. I don\u2019t see letting him steal as unethical exactly.\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re recovering, but it\u2019s not just about abstinence, it\u2019s about looking at the abuse you suffered. Seeing your behavior and its impact. Recognizing this is a huge and something you probably wouldn\u2019t have done before you started your path to recovery. \n\nNext time, you see him, apologize for hurting his feelings and tell him you have feelings too and he hurt yours. If he doesn\u2019t have anything to eat, call CPS. That\u2019s the adult thing to do and accepts your responsibility for what you can\u2019t change.", "I don\u2019t understand why people are torn over this post. I would\u2019ve done the same exact thing you did. I would\u2019ve probably made him wait inside while I called the police to scare the shit out of him.\n\n\nSo he\u2019s 10. Ok, and? You want to wait until he\u2019s a teenager till he finally learns his lesson? By then, he\u2019ll either be in jail or worse. \n\n\nYou did this kid a favor.

You\u2019re both just trying to live under shitty circumstances.

They shouldn\u2019t have been throwing shit at you and calling you names. Soft YTA, but I think it\u2019s a good sign you feel guilty and are reflective. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re using the recovery thing as an excuse\u2014i think you are tremendously stressed out working a min wage job and dealing with life w/o your substance of choice is leaving you raw, without good coping skills, not unlike a kid themselves. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s a way you can apologize to the kid if you see them. They might say something shitty in the moment, but they\u2019ll remember an adult having the humility and decency to own their mistakes forever.
