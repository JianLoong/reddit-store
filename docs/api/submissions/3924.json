And you communicate with those people leading up to the birth. As a dad he was not prepared and that isn't your fault at all. He should be mad at himself for being such a shitty planner.", "NTA - if he had asked you in advance or his babysitter dropped out or something then that would be different. The fact he knew the baby would arrive at some point and didn't make any kind of arrangements makes him the AH for springing it in you. What would he have done if you weren't home? Was that his plan all along, to just drop the child on you? Crazy.", "NTA. You're not entitled to take care of another person's offspring. He purposely did not get a sitter because he assumed you would do it.", "NTA. It was his choice to stand there and argue with your \"No\" answer (if that is the reason he supposedly missed the baby's birth). Clearly he didn't need you to watch the child. He could have taken the child with him as soon as he got the call -- which is what he ultimately did.", "NTA. It was his responsibility to find a suitable baby sitter. You weren't it.", "NTA - it\u2019s not your responsibility and I would have done the same. I would also start looking for another place to live, cause you know that baby is going to visit and be another nightmare to deal with. A man with children should have his own place, and not rely on a college kid he happens to share a house with, this is ridiculous", "NTA. He should not have assumed you would just watch his child on a whim. It was his responsibility to have proper arrangements in place first. He has no one to be angry at except for himself. It's probably time to find a new roommate.", "NTA. \n\nWhile I think friends and roommates- or just good humans in general- should show up for people in an emergency, this wasn't exactly that. He knew that he was having a baby, he knows the general timeframe, and he knows he has an existing child, so he should have- like you pointed out- hired a sitter or planned to hire one and/or spoken to you and other people in his life about helping, in advance. \n\nIf my neighbor, who I barely know, comes to me and asks me to watch their child because their partner was hit by a car and they have to go to the hospital, I would do it, regardless of my own plans. If they said their wife was in labor and their mom who was supposed to take the other kid had covid, I'd be in to help then too. Because these are emergencies that people couldn't plan for, and I would hope that - as a person living alone and dreading the day I injure myself- that others would do the same for me. \n\nYour roommate had zero plan for his son, even though he has had 8 months to plan for this moment, and that isn't your problem!", "NTA- You are not responsible for watching other people\u2019s kids, no matter what the reason.

To be totally fair, it is understandable that he got confused in the moment, since a lot of people would have dropped what they were doing to help out in a friend's hour of need. But he took you for granted, and should respect that you were not available.", "NTA. Why couldn\u2019t he take his son to the hospital? Even if he let him play in the waiting room or something.

That's not on you. \n\nThat being said... Would it have killed you to help him out? Like would it have really made such a huge life altering difference for you to do him a favor? Was this a one time thing or does he try to leave the kid with you a lot? I'm not saying you're TA and he is most definitely TA, but emergencies, accidents, oversights, and Idiocracy happen to everyone.

He had lots of time to figure out and ask people to take his son when his next child was born. Yes, labor is unpredictable and can happen at any time. But PLENTY of parents for decades have figured out what to do with their kids when the next one is being born. He should\u2019ve lined up options ahead of time. The only way I can think of you being an asshole is if you were very close and for some reason the baby came extremely early, like medically dangerous and not near the due date early, early enough that the babysitters lined up might not be available bc they didn\u2019t plan this early in advanced (I\u2019m talked like 5 weeks before due date) but even then the kid isn\u2019t your responsibility.", "NTA. You risked failing the exam if you watched the kid. \n\nI'm sure under different circumstances you might have helped, but it's unlikely that your professor would let you retake the test because \"my roommate had a baby with an ex and he forced me to babysit\".

What are your rates?\"", "INFO: Are you just flatmates or are you actually friends? Did the child come really early or was it roughly the due date? How close was your exam? Did he bring this up earlier? \n\nHe\u2019s an AH for obviously not making any plans for childcare. While you can never know the exact date, responsible parents have several backups for when it happens and none of them is someone they never even asked about it before.

Had you two previously discussed the plan of the pending birth in terms of expected timeframe (which of course can change) as well as who would watch 4 year old?   And how important, and imminent, was this exam?  Do you believe you would have gotten zero studying done?  You guessed dad would be gone till midnight, the kid would have been long asleep and you would have grabbed a few hours after bedtime at least.

I will say this till the day I die. There is not a single reason on this earth to force someone who doesn't want to babysit to babysit. Straight up dangerous half the time, not everyone knows how to handle children especially hyperactive kids. I say this as a former preschool aid and as a former Super hyperactive child (poorly medicated ADHD and autism). Your children are your responsibility and your responsibility only. You can ask whoever the fuck you want for help, you just gotta respect when they say no. NTA OP", "The people who are saying N T A surprise me. I'm firmly YTA because how in the world is he supposed to \"plan ahead\" for a labor birth. This is on of the most important rites of being a human. It's not like he was asking you to babysit so thathe could party or something but he asked so that he could be there for his child's birth. Even if you hire a babysitter for this purpose whos to say that on the day of labor they would be available.

In the grand scheme of things, I'm OK doing a bit less than usual on a test, if it helps someone see the BIRTH OF THEIR CHILD.  \n\nYes, yes, he definitely could have and should have planned way better.  But you could have also done some mental calculation to be the bigger person, to weigh your personal needs in that moment vs his, and seen that you live in a society and you were being asked to help in one of the most important rites imaginable.  You failed at that, and that to me is a larger failure than your test would have been.", "Are you the AH? Yes & no\nWas your exam the next day?\nPpl keep saying he should have prepared.
