The couple invited four of the bride-to-be's co-workers, of which my wife was one of them, and their husbands/families as they see fit (we have two children, M7 and F4).  The wedding is this November and we were notified we'd be invited a couple months ago, receiving the Save the Date last week.  We've preliminarily discussed moving around other trips to accommodate, however have yet to book anything.\n\nUpon researching the trip, two of the other girls decided they were not going to bring their husbands/families as the cost was too high ($2000/person for 5 days or $2200/person for 7 days).  The third girl said her husband will unlikely be able to get off work as the trip is in his busy season, so she's planning on going alone as well.  I can get off work and we can afford the costs.  Yesterday I was told that I was basically uninvited from the vacation, not because of the bride/groom changing their minds, but because my wife decided it should be a \"girls trip\" instead.  I told her I have no issue with her going out with her friends while we're there and can easily keep myself occupied for a few evenings, but I'd really like to go because it's a country I've never been to, which I surely will never get another chance to visit. (For context, we were big travelers before having kids, having been all over the continental US, Hawaii, Mexico, Jamaica, Cuba, DR, and Europe before kids and COVID slowed travel significantly (besides Disney World).)  She replied that it's never been a bucket list destination (we have no bucket list) and that I've been places she's never been before (NYC and LV before we even met, both of which I would gladly revisit).  I told her I honesty don't know how to react as I'm really offended, and I pointed out that her friends husbands aren't coming because of finances or schedules, but she just doesn't want her husband to come, and doesn't she see anything wrong with that?   \n\nI should also probably note that my wife regularly goes on overnights with her girlfriends and that I never do, she's far from bound to the house.\n\nI should also note that a room by yourself is $3300, so the two girls are planning to room together to keep costs down, but the third girl who's husband can't attend because of scheduling would need her own room if she didn't stay with my wife, although she can definitely afford it.\n\nI suggested we rank our choices from 1 to 7 to see where we're at with the seven choices being:  \n\\- her going by herself for 7 days, her going by herself for 5 days, couples trip for 5, couples trip for 7, family trip for 5, family trip for 7, and no one goes.  She refused to partake in the exercise.\n\nI haven't been able to stop thinking about this and still want to go.

Obviously, you are going to feel disappointed when the opportunity is no longer available & you have every right to feel that way. \n\nYour wife seems to be making unilateral decisions without any regard for your feelings. That\u2019s a problem. She is putting her friends above you. That\u2019s a bigger problem. She doesn\u2019t want to discuss it like an adult. That\u2019s the biggest problem. At this point, you need to start discussing actual problems not ranking trip choices. Not getting to go to a place you want to visit is the least of your worries.\n\neta \u2014 It sounds like this trip went from a wedding/vacation couples get-away trip to a wedding/sorority girls spring break week. Listen I have 4 kids I totally understand getting a break from reality every once & awhile but my first travel partner choice would always be my husband. I\u2019m very confused why you are excluded if you still want to go. Makes no sense.", "NTA if this was to be a girls trip that should\u2019ve been established from the onset, her uninviting you after all the other husbands dropped out is definitely rude. It\u2019s also something that you guys were both invited to by the couple.", "NTA- If the wedding is still on, than by definition it is not a girls' trip. IMO, even suggesting you should be excluded is not only rude but suspicious.", "INFO so you keep the kids too? Would you need to take time off to care for them?\n\nHonestly if she goes on this trip alone - then you get to book the exact same days anywhere in the world and go alone or take a friend.", "NTA.\n\nUse the money you would have spent at the wedding, and take yourself and your kids somewhere else fun. I bet that Florida Disneyland is nice weather this time of year, nice and warm while the rest of the USA is cold and miserable.\n\nOr alternatively, stay at home and watch the kids, then book yourself a \"me time\" vacation in an exotic country, at some future point, without the wife and kids, perhaps take a mate along.", "NTA. I can see how your feelings would be hurt. Good luck to you.", "NTA - it didn't start as a girl's trip. You were invited by the bride and groom. And it seems that this isn't even a rule that the bride has come up with but your wife. You have every right to feel hurt by this. Someone else pointed out that this is suspicious on your wife's part and a half agree, but the other half of me says that she's trying to help the other friend out by splitting the room with her and/ or that she wants a week to herself since her other friends are getting one. Either way it makes her an asshole for uninviting you after you had already gotten your hopes up.", "NTA\n\nI hate destination weddings for the usually high cost that the happy couple expects people to shell out, so understand that some of the coworkers/friends are trying to budget for that. However unless the wedding is cancelled, it's not a girl's trip. It's still a wedding. The sudden push for you to stay home is concerning. Now, if she had said the kids aren't welcome that would be a different story. But it sounds like she just doesn't want you to go. I'd be asking a lot more questions than just about finances at this point.", "NTA.  You were invited and you should go if you want to go.  She is wrong to \"uninvite\" you.\n\nThat said, I can guarantee you that you are not going to have any fun on this trip if you are not \"wanted.\"  Especially if, as it seems, you aren't close with any of the people who will be there.  These are her work friends, and you were never more than a \"+1.\"\n\nYes there are things you can do in Costa Rica on your own, and you would probably enjoy it, other than the death stares from the girls and the silence from your wife.\n\nI would suggest that if she goes alone, you get whatever amount she spends to do something else for yourself.  Doesn't have to be a trip, just has to be something you want that is not for her or the family.", "NTA \n\nI gotta admit and hate to say it but it does seem like it was set-up. Something is not right here.", "NTA. Could always go on a vacation somewhere else then. Where do you wanna visit?", "NTA. Her \u201creasons\u201d are justifications of why it\u2019s okay for her to go by herself, not explanations of why she doesn\u2019t want you to come in the first place. What\u2019s the real reason? She can\u2019t really turn someone else\u2019s wedding that you were invited to into a girls trip just because.", "NTA. Pick somewhere she\u2019s never been and would love to see and go there while she\u2019s at the wedding. (Ok, probably not the best choice for your marriage, but I\u2019m in a super petty mood today \ud83e\udd23)", "NTA - and maybe this is my broken brain, but the entire story seems like a set-up... i would be very suspicious, somethings seems very off in this entire story of how they all got to go alone... maybe check with the other husbands if their story is real?", "NTA \n\nBut instead of arguing with your wife over it - just plan your own solo trip or a guys trip for later in the year. She can\u2019t complain since she\u2019s had her own.", "NTA", "So you've been uninvited to someone's wedding by your wife because your wife's coworkers' husbands can't get time off? Is that correct? Honestly, I think I'd take this opportunity to book my own trip to Costa Rica, skip the boring wedding parts, and have a good time on my own. NTA.", "NTA. My first thought is that she wants to get some side action.. You were invited as a couple. You both  go or both don't go. I would be very concerned.", "NTA.  Is the husband (assuming based on the \"bride-to-be\" and not \"brides\" comment) not going as well? The idea that a wedding is a \"girl's only\" trip is ridiculous lol. Even if it were a lesbian couple, surely they have male family members or friends.", "NTA.  Seems shady.", "Info:  Were your kids also going to go on this trip with you?", "NTA My gut is she'd being pressured by odd person out to split hotel room. I'd talk to her about it since both were invited and figure out what is at the heart.\n\n One option if you can afford it is letting get you and splitting her room then the two of you going back together\n\nAnother idea is her going for the wedding and x days then you flying it at the end and the two of you extending it to see things together perhaps in another section of the country.", "NTA.  I see from a comment that you were planning on leaving the kids at home with grandparents. I think you would have to anticipate quite a lot of alone time on the trip then, because you would be treated as the fifth wheel and you and your wife wouldn\u2019t be going off doing as many things on your own as you would anticipate I suspect.  So I would spare yourself and not go.  But yeah, your wife is clearly changing the scope of it.  It\u2019s quite likely because all the rest are traveling alone and now they\u2019re thinking well it will just be nice for the group of girls to go\u2026 Quite frankly partly understandable. But her unwillingness to see your side is what makes her more of an asshole. I don\u2019t think it would be unreasonable for you to suggest she goes for a shorter time now because it\u2019s not a joint vacation and because that\u2019s quite a luxury trip on her own, and she seems to from what you say has girls weekends fairly frequently.", "NTA.", "NTA", "I think there is a chance that your wife is getting pressured by her work friends for it just be them. Their spouses can\u2019t make it and now it\u2019s cheaper for them to have her share and room and easier for it to be the 4 of them. They\u2019re at work and probably talking about how this is a great solution, blah blah blah\u2026\n\nCould you talk to her and see if that is part of it? If she is feeling that if she doesn\u2019t do it as just the coworkers, someone can\u2019t go, will it be weird at work? If so, maybe there is a compromise.\n\nShe goes and spends 3 night with friends at the wedding. You either:\n\nGo down at the same time and go to another resort for 3 nights, she comes over and stays 4/5 with you.\n\nYou fly seperate a few days later and the 2 of you meet at another resort.\n\nYou bring the kids to to a resort for the first few days and she meets you after. \n\nThe friend would need to pay more for a couple of nights, but it\u2019s a compromise from all or nothing. \n\nGoing with NAH, but could lean towards NTA depending on how our wife reacts to compromise suggestions.", "NTA I think it's reasonable of her to change this into a \"girl's trip\". Regardless of why the other partners are no longer going on the trip this seems like an easy way to prevent any unfortunate insecurities that might develop amongst the other co-workers - but it doesn't give her the right to dictate what you do.\n\nI don't see why you can't travel and experience the country without her because isn't that exactly what she is asking to do? Maybe she's afraid that the mere presence of you in the country will make her feel guilty or coerced to include you in the festivities, especially considering you mentioned being occupied for \"a few evenings\".", "NAH \n\nIdK\u2026 I personally think the best solution is for her to tell her friend that because overall plans have changed, you two can\u2019t make it, and you both spend the time and money on a trip somewhere else you *both* want to go and are excited about together (while still leaving the kids at home with the grandparents.)\n\nIf wife balks at this, maybe she wasn\u2019t being quite truthful about the trip to begin with.", "NAH.  I can see why you wanna go, I can see why she likes the idea of a girl's trip, nobody's an AH you just want different things.  Hopefully you can talk it out.", "You gave a bunch of options that don\u2019t include the third woman, and maybe your wife felt she\u2019d feel alienated. Is there any option of you going and sharing a room with her? Maybe there\u2019s an affordable room with a separate bedroom or something? Than you go as well and your wife can help her not feel alone?\n\nI deff think NTA, but you would be for forbidding her to go. I get being upset. But this is her friends wedding. So it be shitty to keep her from that.", "NTA\n\nSeems sexist to me.\n\nYou're being excluded on your gender? \n\nYou wouldn't be wrong pushing this. But always consider you can travel elsewhere on your own if you wish.", "ESH. Your wife is now in the position that she is probably being pressured by the workmates to leave you as they are without their husband and it will be cheaper all around to go just the four of them. But if you force you wife to take you will it actually be a good trip if her nad her friends are annoyed with you being there making you unwelcome.\n\nTake the money you would have spent and book somewhere else to go whilst she is away.
