The couple invited four of the bride-to-be's co-workers, of which my wife was one of them, and their husbands/families as they see fit (we have two children, M7 and F4).  The wedding is this November and we were notified we'd be invited a couple months ago, receiving the Save the Date last week.  We've preliminarily discussed moving around other trips to accommodate, however have yet to book anything.\n\nUpon researching the trip, two of the other girls decided they were not going to bring their husbands/families as the cost was too high ($2000/person for 5 days or $2200/person for 7 days).  The third girl said her husband will unlikely be able to get off work as the trip is in his busy season, so she's planning on going alone as well.  I can get off work and we can afford the costs.  Yesterday I was told that I was basically uninvited from the vacation, not because of the bride/groom changing their minds, but because my wife decided it should be a \"girls trip\" instead.  I told her I have no issue with her going out with her friends while we're there and can easily keep myself occupied for a few evenings, but I'd really like to go because it's a country I've never been to, which I surely will never get another chance to visit. (For context, we were big travelers before having kids, having been all over the continental US, Hawaii, Mexico, Jamaica, Cuba, DR, and Europe before kids and COVID slowed travel significantly (besides Disney World).)  She replied that it's never been a bucket list destination (we have no bucket list) and that I've been places she's never been before (NYC and LV before we even met, both of which I would gladly revisit).  I told her I honesty don't know how to react as I'm really offended, and I pointed out that her friends husbands aren't coming because of finances or schedules, but she just doesn't want her husband to come, and doesn't she see anything wrong with that?   \n\nI should also probably note that my wife regularly goes on overnights with her girlfriends and that I never do, she's far from bound to the house.\n\nI should also note that a room by yourself is $3300, so the two girls are planning to room together to keep costs down, but the third girl who's husband can't attend because of scheduling would need her own room if she didn't stay with my wife, although she can definitely afford it.\n\nI suggested we rank our choices from 1 to 7 to see where we're at with the seven choices being:  \n\\- her going by herself for 7 days, her going by herself for 5 days, couples trip for 5, couples trip for 7, family trip for 5, family trip for 7, and no one goes.  She refused to partake in the exercise.\n\nI haven't been able to stop thinking about this and still want to go.

Obviously, you are going to feel disappointed when the opportunity is no longer available & you have every right to feel that way. \n\nYour wife seems to be making unilateral decisions without any regard for your feelings. That\u2019s a problem. She is putting her friends above you. That\u2019s a bigger problem. She doesn\u2019t want to discuss it like an adult. That\u2019s the biggest problem. At this point, you need to start discussing actual problems not ranking trip choices. Not getting to go to a place you want to visit is the least of your worries.\n\neta \u2014 It sounds like this trip went from a wedding/vacation couples get-away trip to a wedding/sorority girls spring break week. Listen I have 4 kids I totally understand getting a break from reality every once & awhile but my first travel partner choice would always be my husband. I\u2019m very confused why you are excluded if you still want to go. Makes no sense.\n\neta more \u2014 don\u2019t take yourself somewhere else ... tit for tat isn\u2019t the answer here. TALK to your wife. Her plan is not acceptable. Find a mutually agreeable solution. If she prefers going with her friends find out why??? Excluding you is not a good choice, why is she making that decision?!?", "NTA if this was to be a girls trip that should\u2019ve been established from the onset, her uninviting you after all the other husbands dropped out is definitely rude. It\u2019s also something that you guys were both invited to by the couple.", "NTA- If the wedding is still on, than by definition it is not a girls' trip. IMO, even suggesting you should be excluded is not only rude but suspicious.", "INFO so you keep the kids too? Would you need to take time off to care for them?\n\nHonestly if she goes on this trip alone - then you get to book the exact same days anywhere in the world and go alone or take a friend.", "NTA.\n\nUse the money you would have spent at the wedding, and take yourself and your kids somewhere else fun. I bet that Florida Disneyland is nice weather this time of year, nice and warm while the rest of the USA is cold and miserable.\n\nOr alternatively, stay at home and watch the kids, then book yourself a \"me time\" vacation in an exotic country, at some future point, without the wife and kids, perhaps take a mate along.", "NTA. I can see how your feelings would be hurt. Good luck to you.", "NTA - it didn't start as a girl's trip. You were invited by the bride and groom. And it seems that this isn't even a rule that the bride has come up with but your wife. You have every right to feel hurt by this. Someone else pointed out that this is suspicious on your wife's part and a half agree, but the other half of me says that she's trying to help the other friend out by splitting the room with her and/ or that she wants a week to herself since her other friends are getting one. Either way it makes her an asshole for uninviting you after you had already gotten your hopes up.", "NTA\n\nI hate destination weddings for the usually high cost that the happy couple expects people to shell out, so understand that some of the coworkers/friends are trying to budget for that. However unless the wedding is cancelled, it's not a girl's trip. It's still a wedding. The sudden push for you to stay home is concerning. Now, if she had said the kids aren't welcome that would be a different story. But it sounds like she just doesn't want you to go. I'd be asking a lot more questions than just about finances at this point.", "NTA.  You were invited and you should go if you want to go.  She is wrong to \"uninvite\" you.\n\nThat said, I can guarantee you that you are not going to have any fun on this trip if you are not \"wanted.\"  Especially if, as it seems, you aren't close with any of the people who will be there.  These are her work friends, and you were never more than a \"+1.\"\n\nYes there are things you can do in Costa Rica on your own, and you would probably enjoy it, other than the death stares from the girls and the silence from your wife.\n\nI would suggest that if she goes alone, you get whatever amount she spends to do something else for yourself.  Doesn't have to be a trip, just has to be something you want that is not for her or the family.", "NTA \n\nI gotta admit and hate to say it but it does seem like it was set-up. Something is not right here.", "NTA. Could always go on a vacation somewhere else then. Where do you wanna visit?", "NTA. Her \u201creasons\u201d are justifications of why it\u2019s okay for her to go by herself, not explanations of why she doesn\u2019t want you to come in the first place. What\u2019s the real reason? She can\u2019t really turn someone else\u2019s wedding that you were invited to into a girls trip just because.", "NTA. Pick somewhere she\u2019s never been and would love to see and go there while she\u2019s at the wedding.

She can\u2019t complain since she\u2019s had her own.", "NTA", "So you've been uninvited to someone's wedding by your wife because your wife's coworkers' husbands can't get time off? Is that correct? Honestly, I think I'd take this opportunity to book my own trip to Costa Rica, skip the boring wedding parts, and have a good time on my own. NTA.", "NTA. My first thought is that she wants to get some side action.. You were invited as a couple. You both  go or both don't go. I would be very concerned.", "NTA.  Is the husband (assuming based on the \"bride-to-be\" and not \"brides\" comment) not going as well? The idea that a wedding is a \"girl's only\" trip is ridiculous lol. Even if it were a lesbian couple, surely they have male family members or friends.", "NTA.  Seems shady.", "Info:  Were your kids also going to go on this trip with you?", "NTA My gut is she'd being pressured by odd person out to split hotel room. I'd talk to her about it since both were invited and figure out what is at the heart.\n\n One option if you can afford it is letting get you and splitting her room then the two of you going back together\n\nAnother idea is her going for the wedding and x days then you flying it at the end and the two of you extending it to see things together perhaps in another section of the country.", "NTA.  I see from a comment that you were planning on leaving the kids at home with grandparents. I think you would have to anticipate quite a lot of alone time on the trip then, because you would be treated as the fifth wheel and you and your wife wouldn\u2019t be going off doing as many things on your own as you would anticipate I suspect.  So I would spare yourself and not go.  But yeah, your wife is clearly changing the scope of it.  It\u2019s quite likely because all the rest are traveling alone and now they\u2019re thinking well it will just be nice for the group of girls to go\u2026 Quite frankly partly understandable. But her unwillingness to see your side is what makes her more of an asshole. I don\u2019t think it would be unreasonable for you to suggest she goes for a shorter time now because it\u2019s not a joint vacation and because that\u2019s quite a luxury trip on her own, and she seems to from what you say has girls weekends fairly frequently.", "NTA.", "NTA", "I think there is a chance that your wife is getting pressured by her work friends for it just be them. Their spouses can\u2019t make it and now it\u2019s cheaper for them to have her share and room and easier for it to be the 4 of them. They\u2019re at work and probably talking about how this is a great solution, blah blah blah\u2026\n\nCould you talk to her and see if that is part of it? If she is feeling that if she doesn\u2019t do it as just the coworkers, someone can\u2019t go, will it be weird at work? If so, maybe there is a compromise.\n\nShe goes and spends 3 night with friends at the wedding. You either:\n\nGo down at the same time and go to another resort for 3 nights, she comes over and stays 4/5 with you.\n\nYou fly seperate a few days later and the 2 of you meet at another resort.\n\nYou bring the kids to to a resort for the first few days and she meets you after. \n\nThe friend would need to pay more for a couple of nights, but it\u2019s a compromise from all or nothing. \n\nGoing with NAH, but could lean towards NTA depending on how our wife reacts to compromise suggestions.", "NTA I think it's reasonable of her to change this into a \"girl's trip\". Regardless of why the other partners are no longer going on the trip this seems like an easy way to prevent any unfortunate insecurities that might develop amongst the other co-workers - but it doesn't give her the right to dictate what you do.\n\nI don't see why you can't travel and experience the country without her because isn't that exactly what she is asking to do? Maybe she's afraid that the mere presence of you in the country will make her feel guilty or coerced to include you in the festivities, especially considering you mentioned being occupied for \"a few evenings\".", "NAH \n\nIdK\u2026 I personally think the best solution is for her to tell her friend that because overall plans have changed, you two can\u2019t make it, and you both spend the time and money on a trip somewhere else you *both* want to go and are excited about together (while still leaving the kids at home with the grandparents.)\n\nIf wife balks at this, maybe she wasn\u2019t being quite truthful about the trip to begin with.", "NAH.  I can see why you wanna go, I can see why she likes the idea of a girl's trip, nobody's an AH you just want different things.  Hopefully you can talk it out.", "You gave a bunch of options that don\u2019t include the third woman, and maybe your wife felt she\u2019d feel alienated. Is there any option of you going and sharing a room with her? Maybe there\u2019s an affordable room with a separate bedroom or something? Than you go as well and your wife can help her not feel alone?\n\nI deff think NTA, but you would be for forbidding her to go. I get being upset. But this is her friends wedding. So it be shitty to keep her from that.", "NTA\n\nSeems sexist to me.\n\nYou're being excluded on your gender? \n\nYou wouldn't be wrong pushing this. But always consider you can travel elsewhere on your own if you wish.", "ESH. Your wife is now in the position that she is probably being pressured by the workmates to leave you as they are without their husband and it will be cheaper all around to go just the four of them. But if you force you wife to take you will it actually be a good trip if her nad her friends are annoyed with you being there making you unwelcome.\n\nTake the money you would have spent and book somewhere else to go whilst she is away.

Since it evolved into a girls trip, having you tag along would probably require her to divide her attention and that amount of planning is not relaxing.

Costa Rica is a very cool place to travel and this is an opportunity for you all to travel again - which you did more of pre-kids and pre-COVID.  I was itching to travel again once we were vaccinated and travel was opening up and would have been really disappointed if I had a trip in the works and then wasn't able to go.  Plus, it feels really bad to be uninvited to something.  \n\nI also understand why your wife would be interested in a \"girls trip\" in this situation - it's her work friend's wedding and 3 other of her work friends are going without their spouses, so it would be fun to go as a group of women.  It's fun to go on a girls trip (or a guys trip) and the dynamic is just different than with traveling with spouse and/or kids.  Others have mentioned suspicions about your wife's motives, but I don't really see that - I don't think there is anything wrong with traveling solo or with friends and without the spouse and kids. Debauchery isn't the only reason to go someplace without a spouse.   And it could be that she is getting pressure from the other women to make this a girls trip - that could be a factor too.  \n\nI think that the issue is really how your wife approached the situation - rather than talking with you about, it, she made the decision and told you.  That's not right - and that's where she is encroaching on AH territory.  She could have suggested the idea to see what you thought - find out how interested were you in visiting CR and attending this wedding.

It was like I never got time to explore Dominican Republic at all. Going to a new country and staying at a generic resort with westernized food and other people from the same background is barely traveling.  You have a get out of jail free card here.\n\nDo you enjoy solo travel? A compromise might be to stay off resort at a guesthouse or something less pricey (I went for a week pre pandemic and I don\u2019t think we spent over $60 a night outside San Juan) but use your wife\u2019s access to the resort for pool/beach access and other than the wedding pretty much do your own thing (rather than boring rehearsal dinners or forced socializing with her co workers you can go surfing or hike the rainforest or cuddle with baby sloths and eat delicious local food while your wife picks at a chicken Caesar salad by a generic pool) and maybe meet up at night for drinks or whatever and/or add a couple days together at the end actually seeing Costa Rica. Alternatively, i honestly think that a Dad & kids trip could be super fun and you could drop them at the resort while you work (as most pricy all inclusive type resorts have kids programs).  High speed internet is widely available and aside from airfare, you three could have an amazing trip for half the resort fee.", "NTA.

I can\u2019t imagine going somewhere as breathtaking as Costa Rica and leaving my husband at home. I\u2019ve been places he\u2019s never been and vice versa but that was before we knew each other. Neither one of us has ever been there and that\u2019s a trip where I\u2019d want all my memories to include him.", "NTA because you were BOTH invited to the wedding so you have just as much right to go as she does.\n\nIMO you need to tell your wife that you are going on the trip regardless of whether she \"approves\" or not.", "Does your wife work with only women? If not then chances are the bride also invited make coworkers as well,  and it sounds like your wife wants to party with them and not you. I hope I'm wrong, but who knows", "NTA. I am willing to bet the other girls are pressuring her, but that's no excuse for not taking your feelings into account. I would play it like this if I were you:\n\n1. Tell your wife that you are upset about her not taking your feelings on the matter seriously. Let her know that you were excited about the trip, not only to celebrate the newlyweds but also to spend quality time with her in such a picturesque setting.\n\n2. Tell her that while you will not come if she feels strongly about it, that you want her to take a bit of time before she decides. Ask her to put herself in your shoes and how she would feel being uninvited by the person she loves most to something she was very excited about. Tell her that you love her, but something like this will tarnish your relationship for a very long time, if not forever.\n\n3. If she then decides she would still rather you not come, email the bride and groom and explain exactly why you aren't going to be at their wedding. That you are more than willing, and actually very excited about it, but your wife has decided she would rather go without you.\n\n4. Get the popcorn ready and enjoy the drama.", "NTA.\n\nShe cheatin bruh, I\u2019m sorry.", "Send the kids with her and go to Vegas.", "NTA but your wife sure is.", "You can definitely go on the trip, if you stay out of their time together completely and just do your own thing. Don't be that guy who promises to go your own way and then passive-aggressively makes your wife miserable. Do not bring the kids. Otherwise, YTA.", "NTA!!!\n\n(I (American) lived in CR for 15 years as an expat. It's beautiful! YOU SHOULD GO.)", "YTA\n\nThis is ridiculous mate. Why do you even want to go to some random person's wedding?\n\nLet your wife go with her friends and you can go somewhere with your mates and have some fun instead.", "What\u2019s his name? NTA, be suspicious\u2026.very suspicious", "Your wife is shady AF.\n\nSomething sinister is happening here or something is amiss.\n\nMaybe a last second bachelorette party you weren't told about for the hens of the group?", "NTA\n\nDoes your wife have a habit of pulling the rug from under you and then making great leaps of logic to justify them?", "NTA, but 2 days before she is set to depart, leave and go to somewhere you've always wanted to go and turn off your phone so she has to handle what to do with the kids. Thats what a roommate would do and it seems you are being treated as a roommate.\n\nOR...\n\nTake a different flight and jsut show up at her door. You will then confirm if there's any funny business going on.", "> If she prefers going with her friends find out why???\n\nWhat really gets me is that this isn't necessarily the wife's friends, but they are the coworkers of the bride to be. Maybe, maybe they're all friends outside of work, but I'm just....seeing something here that doesn't add up.", "Let the wife go alone and take a trip with the kids!", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s suspicious, but I do think it\u2019s selfish.", ">Especially if, as it seems, you aren't close with any of the people who will be there.\n\nincluding his wife, it would seem", "The petty is strong with this one\u2026\n\nBeautiful.", "I'm wondering if anyone other than these four women were invited because surely there will be other men there, making it not a girl's trip.  This whole thing is ridiculous on the part of the wife.", "Yea I feel the same. NAH\n\nLike it is a wedding but it also sounds like they are turning it into a pre-wedding bachelorette experience. \n\nIt sucks that OP is being uninvited, but it is true that his presence will through off the dynamic of the trip for the rest of the group. Even if he thinks he can just entertain himself, it would still be sort\u2019ve\u2026 weird. \n\nOP\u2019s wife would probably feel a bit obligated to return back to the hotel with him, or carve out time to do stuff together while the rest of the group is doing other things involving the bride and the wedding.", "Sounds like he\u2019s interested in the destination. The wedding is just a reason to go. Plus I have feeling the wife would not approve of a solo trip.", "That's avoiding the problem not fixing  it.  There is something going on that will grow if not address", "That\u2019s not as relaxing as you think it is.", "That\u2019s more work for him at higher cost lol", "That's the opposite of a fun trip.", "I'm 37 and have regular overnight trips with my friends and don't think that in and of itself is suspicious, but her behavior here is thoughtless and sucks.", "The bride and groom picked a destination wedding and a certain date with a certain place to stay so it could be a girls trip?\n\nThat's a weird thing to do at your wedding.", "Lol you think it\u2019s weird that he\u2019s there for a wedding but you don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird to have a joint wedding/bachelorette party?", "He should law down the law then and show her who's boss.", ">I don\u2019t think that\u2019s super suspicious by itself. \n\nDude, if you hear hoofbeats, look for a horse, not a zebra", "Yeah, I agree, I really doubt the whole wedding is a girls' trip, and am not sure where that assumption is coming from. There'll be a bunch of people there who have nothing to do with these four co-workers or their hotel arrangements. The \"girls' trip\" part only refers to these four.", "I recently watched the episode of Scrubs where Dr. Cox uses this line.", "ya wife might be cheating fam lol"]}
