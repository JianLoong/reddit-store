The couple invited four of the bride-to-be's co-workers, of which my wife was one of them, and their husbands/families as they see fit (we have two children, M7 and F4).  The wedding is this November and we were notified we'd be invited a couple months ago, receiving the Save the Date last week.  We've preliminarily discussed moving around other trips to accommodate, however have yet to book anything.\n\nUpon researching the trip, two of the other girls decided they were not going to bring their husbands/families as the cost was too high ($2000/person for 5 days or $2200/person for 7 days).  The third girl said her husband will unlikely be able to get off work as the trip is in his busy season, so she's planning on going alone as well.  I can get off work and we can afford the costs.  Yesterday I was told that I was basically uninvited from the vacation, not because of the bride/groom changing their minds, but because my wife decided it should be a \"girls trip\" instead.  I told her I have no issue with her going out with her friends while we're there and can easily keep myself occupied for a few evenings, but I'd really like to go because it's a country I've never been to, which I surely will never get another chance to visit. (For context, we were big travelers before having kids, having been all over the continental US, Hawaii, Mexico, Jamaica, Cuba, DR, and Europe before kids and COVID slowed travel significantly (besides Disney World).)  She replied that it's never been a bucket list destination (we have no bucket list) and that I've been places she's never been before (NYC and LV before we even met, both of which I would gladly revisit).  I told her I honesty don't know how to react as I'm really offended, and I pointed out that her friends husbands aren't coming because of finances or schedules, but she just doesn't want her husband to come, and doesn't she see anything wrong with that?   \n\nI should also probably note that my wife regularly goes on overnights with her girlfriends and that I never do, she's far from bound to the house.\n\nI should also note that a room by yourself is $3300, so the two girls are planning to room together to keep costs down, but the third girl who's husband can't attend because of scheduling would need her own room if she didn't stay with my wife, although she can definitely afford it.\n\nI suggested we rank our choices from 1 to 7 to see where we're at with the seven choices being:  \n\\- her going by herself for 7 days, her going by herself for 5 days, couples trip for 5, couples trip for 7, family trip for 5, family trip for 7, and no one goes.  She refused to partake in the exercise.\n\nI haven't been able to stop thinking about this and still want to go.

Obviously, you are going to feel disappointed when the opportunity is no longer available & you have every right to feel that way. \n\nYour wife seems to be making unilateral decisions without any regard for your feelings. That\u2019s a problem. She is putting her friends above you. That\u2019s a bigger problem. She doesn\u2019t want to discuss it like an adult. That\u2019s the biggest problem. At this point, you need to start discussing actual problems not ranking trip choices. Not getting to go to a place you want to visit is the least of your worries.\n\neta \u2014 It sounds like this trip went from a wedding/vacation couples get-away trip to a wedding/sorority girls spring break week. Listen I have 4 kids I totally understand getting a break from reality every once & awhile but my first travel partner choice would always be my husband. I\u2019m very confused why you are excluded if you still want to go. Makes no sense.\n\neta more \u2014 don\u2019t take yourself somewhere else ... tit for tat isn\u2019t the answer here. TALK to your wife. Her plan is not acceptable. Find a mutually agreeable solution. If she prefers going with her friends find out why??? Excluding you is not a good choice, why is she making that decision?!?", "NTA if this was to be a girls trip that should\u2019ve been established from the onset, her uninviting you after all the other husbands dropped out is definitely rude. It\u2019s also something that you guys were both invited to by the couple.", "NTA- If the wedding is still on, than by definition it is not a girls' trip. IMO, even suggesting you should be excluded is not only rude but suspicious.", "INFO so you keep the kids too? Would you need to take time off to care for them?\n\nHonestly if she goes on this trip alone - then you get to book the exact same days anywhere in the world and go alone or take a friend.", "NTA.\n\nUse the money you would have spent at the wedding, and take yourself and your kids somewhere else fun. I bet that Florida Disneyland is nice weather this time of year, nice and warm while the rest of the USA is cold and miserable.\n\nOr alternatively, stay at home and watch the kids, then book yourself a \"me time\" vacation in an exotic country, at some future point, without the wife and kids, perhaps take a mate along.", "NTA. I can see how your feelings would be hurt. Good luck to you.", "NTA - it didn't start as a girl's trip. You were invited by the bride and groom. And it seems that this isn't even a rule that the bride has come up with but your wife. You have every right to feel hurt by this. Someone else pointed out that this is suspicious on your wife's part and a half agree, but the other half of me says that she's trying to help the other friend out by splitting the room with her and/ or that she wants a week to herself since her other friends are getting one. Either way it makes her an asshole for uninviting you after you had already gotten your hopes up.", "NTA\n\nI hate destination weddings for the usually high cost that the happy couple expects people to shell out, so understand that some of the coworkers/friends are trying to budget for that. However unless the wedding is cancelled, it's not a girl's trip. It's still a wedding. The sudden push for you to stay home is concerning. Now, if she had said the kids aren't welcome that would be a different story. But it sounds like she just doesn't want you to go. I'd be asking a lot more questions than just about finances at this point.", "NTA.  You were invited and you should go if you want to go.  She is wrong to \"uninvite\" you.\n\nThat said, I can guarantee you that you are not going to have any fun on this trip if you are not \"wanted.\"  Especially if, as it seems, you aren't close with any of the people who will be there.  These are her work friends, and you were never more than a \"+1.\"\n\nYes there are things you can do in Costa Rica on your own, and you would probably enjoy it, other than the death stares from the girls and the silence from your wife.\n\nI would suggest that if she goes alone, you get whatever amount she spends to do something else for yourself.  Doesn't have to be a trip, just has to be something you want that is not for her or the family.", "NTA \n\nI gotta admit and hate to say it but it does seem like it was set-up. Something is not right here.", "NTA. Could always go on a vacation somewhere else then. Where do you wanna visit?", "NTA. Her \u201creasons\u201d are justifications of why it\u2019s okay for her to go by herself, not explanations of why she doesn\u2019t want you to come in the first place. What\u2019s the real reason? She can\u2019t really turn someone else\u2019s wedding that you were invited to into a girls trip just because.", "NTA. Pick somewhere she\u2019s never been and would love to see and go there while she\u2019s at the wedding.

She can\u2019t complain since she\u2019s had her own.", "NTA", "So you've been uninvited to someone's wedding by your wife because your wife's coworkers' husbands can't get time off? Is that correct? Honestly, I think I'd take this opportunity to book my own trip to Costa Rica, skip the boring wedding parts, and have a good time on my own. NTA.", "NTA. My first thought is that she wants to get some side action.. You were invited as a couple. You both  go or both don't go. I would be very concerned.", "NTA.  Is the husband (assuming based on the \"bride-to-be\" and not \"brides\" comment) not going as well? The idea that a wedding is a \"girl's only\" trip is ridiculous lol. Even if it were a lesbian couple, surely they have male family members or friends.", "NTA.  Seems shady.", "Info:  Were your kids also going to go on this trip with you?", "NTA My gut is she'd being pressured by odd person out to split hotel room. I'd talk to her about it since both were invited and figure out what is at the heart.\n\n One option if you can afford it is letting get you and splitting her room then the two of you going back together\n\nAnother idea is her going for the wedding and x days then you flying it at the end and the two of you extending it to see things together perhaps in another section of the country.", "NTA.  I see from a comment that you were planning on leaving the kids at home with grandparents. I think you would have to anticipate quite a lot of alone time on the trip then, because you would be treated as the fifth wheel and you and your wife wouldn\u2019t be going off doing as many things on your own as you would anticipate I suspect.  So I would spare yourself and not go.  But yeah, your wife is clearly changing the scope of it.  It\u2019s quite likely because all the rest are traveling alone and now they\u2019re thinking well it will just be nice for the group of girls to go\u2026 Quite frankly partly understandable. But her unwillingness to see your side is what makes her more of an asshole. I don\u2019t think it would be unreasonable for you to suggest she goes for a shorter time now because it\u2019s not a joint vacation and because that\u2019s quite a luxury trip on her own, and she seems to from what you say has girls weekends fairly frequently.", "NTA.", "NTA", "I think there is a chance that your wife is getting pressured by her work friends for it just be them. Their spouses can\u2019t make it and now it\u2019s cheaper for them to have her share and room and easier for it to be the 4 of them. They\u2019re at work and probably talking about how this is a great solution, blah blah blah\u2026\n\nCould you talk to her and see if that is part of it? If she is feeling that if she doesn\u2019t do it as just the coworkers, someone can\u2019t go, will it be weird at work? If so, maybe there is a compromise.\n\nShe goes and spends 3 night with friends at the wedding. You either:\n\nGo down at the same time and go to another resort for 3 nights, she comes over and stays 4/5 with you.\n\nYou fly seperate a few days later and the 2 of you meet at another resort.\n\nYou bring the kids to to a resort for the first few days and she meets you after. \n\nThe friend would need to pay more for a couple of nights, but it\u2019s a compromise from all or nothing. \n\nGoing with NAH, but could lean towards NTA depending on how our wife reacts to compromise suggestions.", "NTA I think it's reasonable of her to change this into a \"girl's trip\". Regardless of why the other partners are no longer going on the trip this seems like an easy way to prevent any unfortunate insecurities that might develop amongst the other co-workers - but it doesn't give her the right to dictate what you do.\n\nI don't see why you can't travel and experience the country without her because isn't that exactly what she is asking to do? Maybe she's afraid that the mere presence of you in the country will make her feel guilty or coerced to include you in the festivities, especially considering you mentioned being occupied for \"a few evenings\".", "NAH \n\nIdK\u2026 I personally think the best solution is for her to tell her friend that because overall plans have changed, you two can\u2019t make it, and you both spend the time and money on a trip somewhere else you *both* want to go and are excited about together (while still leaving the kids at home with the grandparents.)\n\nIf wife balks at this, maybe she wasn\u2019t being quite truthful about the trip to begin with.", "NAH.  I can see why you wanna go, I can see why she likes the idea of a girl's trip, nobody's an AH you just want different things.  Hopefully you can talk it out.", "You gave a bunch of options that don\u2019t include the third woman, and maybe your wife felt she\u2019d feel alienated. Is there any option of you going and sharing a room with her? Maybe there\u2019s an affordable room with a separate bedroom or something? Than you go as well and your wife can help her not feel alone?\n\nI deff think NTA, but you would be for forbidding her to go. I get being upset. But this is her friends wedding. So it be shitty to keep her from that.", "NTA\n\nSeems sexist to me.\n\nYou're being excluded on your gender? \n\nYou wouldn't be wrong pushing this. But always consider you can travel elsewhere on your own if you wish.", "ESH. Your wife is now in the position that she is probably being pressured by the workmates to leave you as they are without their husband and it will be cheaper all around to go just the four of them. But if you force you wife to take you will it actually be a good trip if her nad her friends are annoyed with you being there making you unwelcome.\n\nTake the money you would have spent and book somewhere else to go whilst she is away.

Since it evolved into a girls trip, having you tag along would probably require her to divide her attention and that amount of planning is not relaxing.

Costa Rica is a very cool place to travel and this is an opportunity for you all to travel again - which you did more of pre-kids and pre-COVID.  I was itching to travel again once we were vaccinated and travel was opening up and would have been really disappointed if I had a trip in the works and then wasn't able to go.  Plus, it feels really bad to be uninvited to something.  \n\nI also understand why your wife would be interested in a \"girls trip\" in this situation - it's her work friend's wedding and 3 other of her work friends are going without their spouses, so it would be fun to go as a group of women.  It's fun to go on a girls trip (or a guys trip) and the dynamic is just different than with traveling with spouse and/or kids.  Others have mentioned suspicions about your wife's motives, but I don't really see that - I don't think there is anything wrong with traveling solo or with friends and without the spouse and kids. Debauchery isn't the only reason to go someplace without a spouse.   And it could be that she is getting pressure from the other women to make this a girls trip - that could be a factor too.  \n\nI think that the issue is really how your wife approached the situation - rather than talking with you about, it, she made the decision and told you.  That's not right - and that's where she is encroaching on AH territory.  She could have suggested the idea to see what you thought - find out how interested were you in visiting CR and attending this wedding.

It was like I never got time to explore Dominican Republic at all. Going to a new country and staying at a generic resort with westernized food and other people from the same background is barely traveling.  You have a get out of jail free card here.\n\nDo you enjoy solo travel? A compromise might be to stay off resort at a guesthouse or something less pricey (I went for a week pre pandemic and I don\u2019t think we spent over $60 a night outside San Juan) but use your wife\u2019s access to the resort for pool/beach access and other than the wedding pretty much do your own thing (rather than boring rehearsal dinners or forced socializing with her co workers you can go surfing or hike the rainforest or cuddle with baby sloths and eat delicious local food while your wife picks at a chicken Caesar salad by a generic pool) and maybe meet up at night for drinks or whatever and/or add a couple days together at the end actually seeing Costa Rica. Alternatively, i honestly think that a Dad & kids trip could be super fun and you could drop them at the resort while you work (as most pricy all inclusive type resorts have kids programs).  High speed internet is widely available and aside from airfare, you three could have an amazing trip for half the resort fee.", "NTA.

Do they know they are uninviting people to their wedding? Like, this person is also your friend. Did your wife forget this was a wedding invite? Not some plan she made up on her own. Why can\u2019t you go to the wedding and hang out alone? I\u2019m side eyeing your wife. I think you should reach out to your friend and let them know you want to go and will set up your own accommodations. You can hint at the girls trip part if you\u2019re feeling petty.", "OP, tell ur wife ur taking ur own trip with ur kids the same week ur wife goes to the wedding...to somewhere you've never been. \n\nSee what her reaction is", "NTA. You were invited to the wedding. It isn\u2019t your wife\u2019s event to uninvite you from", "NTA- she regularly goes on overnights without you and now she wants to go on a week long, out of the country trip without you? Hmmmm. Option 8, she goes alone and you send a PI to follow.", "It sounds like she wants to cheat on you.", "NTA", "NTA - and something is really fishy here. You don\u2019t just have a little \u201ctrip problem\u201d, you also have a huge \u201cwife problem\u201d. Take a look at that first.", "I feel like I got teleported to a red flag factory. And it\u2019s on fire. Dude. What is happening in your marriage? Do you even know? What kind of wife, at a tender age of pushing 40, goes out on \u201cregular overnight trips with friends\u201d? And what kind of husband sees no issue with that? Maybe it\u2019s a kink of yours, which is fine, but if you genuinely believe that it\u2019s plausible, or reasonable, then what you need right now is not a trip to Costa Rica. What you need more than anything are 3 things: a hot shower, a full panel std test, and a lawyer.", "NTA but don't go.", "Nta. It's just selfish on her part. You're not even asking her to keep you company.", "NTA and I would have to ask if the groomsmen are taking their partners. If not, my spidey senses would be tingling.", "OP listen to this very logical person here. You've got bigger fish than visiting C R.", "Not to mention I\u2019m sure the groom will not love that his wedding has been taken over by a \u201cgirls trip\u201d potentially making him feel like a 3rd wheel at his own wedding.", "I think suspicious is a little strong. \n\nWhile the solo friend can afford her own room, my guess is she will feel \u201clonely\u201d if OP and wife are together and the other two females are together. \n\nYes, you could argue that they will be hanging out all day\u2026but these are 37 year old women. They likely aren\u2019t going to be out clubbing every night (at least I definitely wouldn\u2019t), and my biggest guess is that friend would feel lonely by herself for a few hours at night.\n\nI\u2019ve done races in the past where I didn\u2019t get a roommate because I signed up later. (We had a lot of friends do them together from our gym). While it is something I wouldn\u2019t complain about, it did feel lonely at night when everyone was heading back to the rooms early after dinner, chatting and laughing before they went to bed, then referencing those conversations the next day. It feels like you missed out on the fun. (I fully understood that it was my fault for signing up late, but you do feel a bit left out\u2026it\u2019s hard to describe). \n\nJust my perspective on why she probably doesn\u2019t want him to come\u2026so her friend doesn\u2019t feel lonely at night. My suggestion would be to have three women in one room with a rollaway so OP can still go with his wife. He shouldn\u2019t be penalized for the other husbands not going.", "I can 100% see that. Like, the three going alone are talking about booking spa visits and hanging out, etc. and she\u2019s realizing she\u2019d like to join in too. I imagine it\u2019ll be much easier with her husband and kids there. Plus, she might want the break from being mom for a week. I don\u2019t see an issue, other than it was a little rude to unilaterally uninvite him. But again, I don\u2019t see it as a huge deal.", "This exactly. There is no good scenario for either of you - even if you say \u201cI can entertain myself!\u201d She will not be able to enjoy hanging out with her girls the entire time. \n\nI was the first one married in my friend group. For many years we tried these couple/friends trips. It left me disappointed that I missed out on bonding with friends, with a spouse who was always commenting that he wanted to experience things with me, and overall just being mentally exhausted and split. We don\u2019t do it anymore - we do solo trips and couples trips, but not together. It\u2019s just not fun for anyone at the end of the day.", "Yeah I mostly agree with AITA but whenever it comes to one partner doing anything without the other this sub can get pretty paranoid", "Interestingly, no one has been invited yet! They just have Save the Dates.", "How does he sound childish and entitled? He wants to come along on the trip he was invited to", "This isn\u2019t \u201cgirls night\u201d lol it\u2019s a vacation that he was invited to. Its not a big deal if you happen to have one couple there if you go out to dinner\n\nLol your solution is \u201cwait four years\u201d? What?", "From how I read it, wife is also a coworker. Or so I thought.", "I\u2019m sorry about this, OP. Def NTA but I\u2019d suggest more communication because this seems odd to me. I\u2019ll start by saying I\u2019m the more asocial/hermit one but every trip I\u2019ve planned, I\u2019ve wanted my SO with me. Maybe she wants time away from the kids? (Even still, I\u2019d be worried about SO and I\u2019s pet if I was gone for a week, so I\u2019m more \u201csmother-er\u201d by default. Like my ducklings in a row where I can see them.)", "Nah, lots of women are like that.  Had quite a few that liked spending the night with my ex-wife at our house.  I generally left them alone to their wine drinking and gossiping and handled the kids.\n\nIt may be they like having a little space once in a while which is fine if both spouses get that option.", "why wasn\u2019t it just declared that? they\u2019re 37 it\u2019s not like it needed to be hidden. but it sounds like the wife or someone going wants it to become one.", "OPs wife: \ud83c\udf0e \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80 always has been", "This is the level of pettiness I come here for \ud83e\udd23 she\u2019d deserve that one!", "I'm sure there are. What these four are talking about is kind of a party within a party. Like fly down together probably, stay in the same rooms, hang out together when there's no wedding stuff going on. It doesn't mean there are only four attendees at the whole wedding lol.", "It seems like other men being there might be the draw", "I think it\u2019s  become a girls trip. These are probably the only others guests the wife knows. \n\nI\u2019m sure more wedding guests will be at the resort, but how many people did you know at the last non family wedding you went to? \n\nDestination weddings aren\u2019t all wedding all the time. There\u2019s the ceremony, and the reception, but the guest aren\u2019t expected to commit to much more than that.", "It\u2019s not a big deal to who? Good of you to speak for the other women on the trip.\n\nThe wait four years is based on their 4 year old being old enough to do all the fun stuff that Costa Rica is known for. It wasn\u2019t just some random number. Lol!", "That's how I read it too. Personally I find the idea of a week long getaway with coworkers like a horrible idea, but that's just me", "Your wife would never go on a girls trip? Or your wife would never invite you and then disinvite you?", "Cuz the three adult women probably don't want to share beds, lol", "Eh I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s suspicious so much as she wants a vacation without her kids. OP is still very much NTA, but his wife is being really selfish here.", "The other women who were invited to bring their husbands and chose not to? This is NOT a girls trip, it\u2019s a wedding. People bring their spouses \n\nCosta Rica would be fun for him now if he went there with his wife as they planned for the wedding. Then they would know where to take the kids in uh, 4 years, or they could even go somewhere else", "At my current job, the idea of a getaway with coworkers sounds horrid. However when I was in the military I made close friends that I went on girls trips with or traveled to see them after we moved away from each other.", "Good on you? Some people like child free vacations too.", "LoL I guess so but if you're trying to save money and are good friends it doesn't hurt to split a King. Or splurge a little bit more on a suite instead maybe", "Right? Maybe the groom will be happy there is another man along", "It is not an overnight.  It is a week.  It is in another country and he was invited.", "A zebra is a horse.", "It's not an age.  She is married and doesn't want her spouse to accompany her to another country.  Her spouse WAS invited to attend.", "following your logic, you are a monkey, an almost hairless chimpanzee?", "Wake up sheeple!!", "Pound sand!", "If this was about OP telling his wife she can't go because it's going to be a boys trip instead, you can almost guarantee cheating would be the conclusion majority of posters would jump to.", "The reason no man wants a relationship with you isn't because we don't want a woman with a great personality, it's just that your personality isn't all that great.", "I think the wife found the thread", "I\u2019m literally in a relationship lmao. And he doesn\u2019t assume I\u2019m cheating if I go off and do things without him. It goes both ways.\n\nNot sure where your weird assumption came in but go off, lil fella.", "No, just a normal adult woman in a relationship with an adult man and we don\u2019t feel the need to do everything together and even *gasp* go on getaways without each other.", "Let me guess, the reason no one's ever met him is because he \"lives in Canada\".", "Nta but if you know the other husbands maybe reach out to the one with the schedule and see what's up (so you don't pry into others finances if it is all true)..but something is off here-either with the trip or your wife.", "NTA - everyone is allowed some friend time, but she was a level of dismissive that implies she doesn't see you as a partner.  If she's traveling regularly and you're going nowhere, she's getting what she needs somewhere else", "NTA and your wife is rude as hell.", "NTA, however your wife is a HUGE AH!\ud83d\udcaf", "Let her have a little fun with her girlfriends. Raising kids and working with no time to herself likely ever except in mommy situations. When's the last time she did something on her own? And what if the reverse happened? You'd be totally onboard with her coming with you and your male friends? \n\nI was just in Costa Rica this summer. It's beautiful but it's still a third world country, and my husband and I won't go back. We're both in agreement there.", "NTA\nSounds like your wife doesn't like you very much and would rather holiday with her friends or hell just about anyone else while your at home being Mr dad", "NtA.\n\nIf your wife wants to go alone, plan a separate trip for you and the kids. She can miss out on that for being selfish.\n\nDisneyland would be great for the kids, or maybe some other safe destination that you'd like too.", "NTA. \n \nI don\u2019t really care about all the wild assumptions people are making regarding what your wife will be doing or why she wants to go solo. For me it\u2019s simple. \n \nWho is your wife\u2019s priority, her choice, for this destination wedding. If it\u2019s not you, why not. \n \nI can\u2019t imagine choosing to spend this chance with anyone other than my partner. Sucks that her coworker\u2019s husbands can\u2019t make it, but if mine could then I\u2019m gonna spend a few days in paradise with my first choice.", "You're not wrong to have your feelings hurt, but I can see why you were told not to go.  If my partner was the only one of my group going to something like that then it would mean that I would be making choices and having to split my time between him and my friends all week.  It would be impossible to keep everyone happy and that's hardly a vacation.  \n\nTake your own vacation after, with or without her.  \n\nAnd for the people chirping about \"how this woman could ever go away and leave such young children\" - YTA.  Men take off for extended trips all the time and that's totally fine, right?", "NTA.  This is weird and hurtful behavior on the part of your wife.  What is she thinking to even suggest this?", "So start going on trips yourself.", "Why are you asking for her permission? Just go only don't associate with them. If she has a problem with it it's her problem. She's being incredibly selfish.", "Your wife sounds hella suspicious....", "This.", "NTA. Wife is being an A H, tho.\nYou were invited by the bride and groom. She doesn't get to uninvite you. Also she is being heinously awful. She already gets overnight fun trips on her own but wants to keep you from a luxury fun destination to have an entire week of international ladies night? That sounds incredibly selfish, entitled, and unhinged.", "I was thinking this. There's a big difference for the friend between \"can afford $3300\" and \"would rather pay $1900ish\" especially to go to someone else's wedding.", "Dude should totally be grateful to stay at home and watch the kids while getting cheated on.  How dare he have the audacity to complain?", "I'm pretty sure the groom is not going to encounter the \"girls week vibe\" at all. The couple will have their hands full with last minute logistics and their families and the other attendees--no one is going to expect them to personally entertain this small group of co-workers. They'll probably be *glad* the girls are keeping occupied.", "I think you're spot on!  The problem is, how much fun will the trip be for the husband if he gets his way and all the others (including the wife) are annoyed with him?  NTA but between a rock and a hard place.", "Why?", "That's not suspicious. My bestie lives 45 minutes away, when we hang out sometimes she sleeps over so she can have a few drinks with us. In fact, her husband encouraged me to have her visit more often as she's been working really hard and he said she deserved time away from the house to have fun.", "You think the groom didn\u2019t invite any male friends if his own?", "Seriously, she's dumping on her husband and insisting he stay away from a wedding he was invited to, because she'll be upset that another woman would miss bedtime conversations???", "Unless this was a huge elaborate set up involving months of commitment in keeping up a lie from multiple people, then it was not \u201calways a girls trip,\u201d it\u2019s a wedding. The date was picked by the bride and groom. Is it sus? Yea. Is it a grand master plan with months in the making? This isn\u2019t a Gillian Flynn novel.", "Actually, I can't. And the husband made it clear why. Starting but not ending with his being invited, and acknowledging that the other husbands might not be able to afford the trip. AND they spent several days weighing alternatives BUT all of them included his being there---and then she sprang this women's trip on him. If the genders were reversed, I would be furious at my husband, and the whole thing would introduce doubt in a relationship where it wasn't before.", "This is not an overnight, it's a week. AND he was invited. I'm a woman and it hurts to see how many of the pro-wife women responding are misstating the case.", "This is A WEEK.", "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right or justified. My guess is solo friend is guilting her to be roomies, but what do I know.", "This was going to be my suggestion.  But wife needs a reality check. How does she think she has the right to uninvite op from the wedding?  NTA op but find out what's going on with your wife.", "Why does he have to go someplace she isn't interested in?", "It\u2019s not even the bach trip", "As does his wife. But this did not start out to be a women's trip AND he was invited. You can support the wife but don't lie about what's true.", ">Eh I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s suspicious so much as she wants a vacation without her kids **and husband who were all previously invited.**\n \nWow your line looks a whole lot different when you don\u2019t deliberately leave out the facts. FTFY.", "I'm not misstating anything. I responded to a comment remarking on her overnight trips. I'm also dead on that the wife has decided she will have more fun doing the trip with her friends now that the other spouses weren't  joining. OP needs to figure out why that is and if he's OK with the reason. I'm not pro anyone in this scenario. I'm stating facts. My comment is not the one for you to pick apart. Perhaps choose a different example to make your point.", "Just to avoid future conflicts.  I\u2019m sure there are destinations he\u2019d like  to go that she is indifferent too. \n\nThis way they both get what they want and minimizes resentments.", "This isn\u2019t The Wedding Crashers. Often people just hang out with the people they knew before the wedding. Which means the female coworkers\u2026and one husband hanging out for 5 days together. Weeee\u2026\n\nI have girls nights and I have couples nights. Both fun but the conversations are different. And my husband does a guys trip every couple years. The stories sound hilarious, but it would be super awkward if I decided I was going to insert myself in the trip. \n\nThe wife might have really wanted a couples trip, but once she found out that wasn\u2019t happening, it became a girls trip for the coworkers.", "If she\u2019s not cheating she prefers her friends to him.", "Zebras are not horses. They are a different species.", "It\u2019s not about the costarican yogurt!!", "He's always going to resent her for CR, and she can't get over a Vegas trip before they were together", "I'm replying to the person who said its inherently suspicious that she goes on overnight trips with her friends at 37 years old. Because apparently there's an expiration date on that?\n\nOP's wife is 100% in the wrong here. But I don't think she's cheating just because she's goes on trips with her friends.", "I think that was just to point out they don\u2019t have to go everywhere together, not that she was hot and bothered over vegas."]}
