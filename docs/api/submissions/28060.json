To be honest, there were enough faults on both of their parts so no one can claim the high ground. Because his income was several times of hers, the court awarded her alimony. Thankfully, they were married for less than 10 years so he only had to pay her alimony for half of the years they were married. His last payment to her will happen this month so the guys and I are planning an end of alimony party for him.\n\nWe\u2019re planning a week long stay in Vegas at the Wynn and will chip in to fully cover his end.

She wasn\u2019t mad that we\u2019re having a guy\u2019s trip because we\u2019ve taken separate vacations before without any issues. She was unhappy with the theme and said that it was in bad taste. I disagree and we had discussions about it until we agreed to disagree. On Friday she was using my phone to watch her shows and one of the guys sent a pic he designed for a shirt we\u2019re planning to have made for him to wear. The gist of the design is that he\u2019s free of alimony payments and can afford to eat again with some graphics. It was in a group text and the other guys texted their robust approval.

I thought our argument was coming to an end but this morning while we were getting ready for work, she gave me the silent treatment and completely ignored my questions.\n\nBasically she wants me to cancel the trip and admit that we\u2019re being terrible people for celebrating something so painful.

Your brother didn't lose the ability to feed himself. Not unless his income plunged and he failed to update the court to have the numbers recalculated. But if that's what happened, that's on him, not his ex. Yet, with the shirt, you are implying that his ex sucked him dry, which is incredibly disrespectful towards the ex. I'm not sure it propels you into AH-territory, hence the NAH-verdict, but 'bad taste' is too polite a phrase to describe it.\n\nConsidering the vibe from your post... The real reason this fight has been lasting for so long is your inability to empathise and actually listen to what your girlfriend is saying. If I was your GF, I'd look elsewhere for a long-term partner, simply because you fail to comprehend that \"her not knowing the ex\" does not and should not equal \"her not being angry about it\".", "How is this crass?

Alimony payments are just like those.", "NAH, you two just have different values/philosophies about relationships.  How people choose to treat each other at the end of a relationship says just as much as anything they do during a relationship.  She may be concerned about the implications of what she\u2019s seeing from you for how you would treat her if your relationship ends, and wondering whether she needs to protect herself from that if the relationship continues.", "NTA to support your friend, but you and your GF might not be compatible.\n\nI agree that the theme and T-Shirts are in poor taste, but I don't agree that you can't celebrate him finally cutting ties with is EX.", "I NFO : just to be sure I follow, when you say \"alimony payments\", you mean money that goes toward her ex, not like child support to pay for his children ?\n\nEdit : NAH. IMO it's in really bad taste, but that doesn't make you an asshole. Your gf probably have a very different opinion from you and I don't blame her.", "At least you dont have to pay her alimony when you break up\n\nThis is a relationship issue and some people arent meant to be together, fit together.  \n\nShes offended by the jest and theme.  You dont care and want to support your friend", "ESH\n\nIt appears you\u2019re intentionally antagonizing your gf. Why? She doesn\u2019t agree with what your doing. \n\nIt appears your gf is applying her own emotions to something that has nothing to do with her. Are you sure she isn\u2019t friends with the ex or did she experience a traumatic experience with a divorce in her family. Her reaction seems like an overreaction.\n\neta \u2014 if last \u201calimony\u201d payment means end of child support \u2026 then your gf is right.

He had a set amount to pay off and he did it. No obligation shirked.  If your brother wants to celebrate, that's fine. \n\nBut you can't stop your gf from being upset i guess.\n\nIs anyone bad mouthing the ex?
