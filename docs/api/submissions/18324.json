{"id": 18324, "submission_id": "13tietg", "title": "AITA for demanding preferential parking for my daughter's birthday?", "selftext": "My (37M) wife (36F) and I have been on a trial separation from our marriage for 9 months or so. I have missed my house but I understand that she needed some time alone. We have been together for a long time so being apart temporarily is not the end of the world. I went to pick up our daughter (12F) to go to the movies and found an unknown car on my usual parking spot in our garage. I don't come around our house much lately, usually just once a month. I could have just called our daughter for her to come to the car without parking but I wanted too talk to my wife about that new car.\n\nMy wife told me that her boss (Mark, 41M) has been staying at our house ocasionally because of work reasons and that he puts his car on that space now. It was really inconvenient for me to go find another spot and I felt it was unfair I wasn't told in advance of this situation. She always forgets to tell me important stuff like that and makes me waste time having to ask her directly. Anyway, the main problem came up after I came back from the cinema with my daughter.\n\nMy daughter's birthday is next week and she is having a small party mostly for family and close friends so I talk to my wife and told her to make sure the space for my car is empty for me the day of the birthday party but she told me that probably won't be the case as Mark will certainly be invited to the celebration because he is her \"best friend\". I found that to be a big exaggeration. I knew she and Mark always had a good work relationship since she started working for him but I never see them as real \"friends\" let alone \"best friends\".\n\nI have been arguing with her about this but we can't came to an agreement. She just says that I should come earlier so I have time to park and don't arrive late to the party but my complaint is really about fairness and justice not those practical technicalities. She offered that I can talk directly to Mark about this but I don't want that. He is a lawyer and I know they are very good manipulating you into agreeing with them. My wife is a lawyer too but I am used to her so her tactics are not effective with me.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1685222070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13tietg/aita_for_demanding_preferential_parking_for_my/", "score": 425, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
