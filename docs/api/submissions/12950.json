Even if it had been one of the two. At your age, you need your own space and privacy.", "NTA. It\u2019s great you\u2019re still visiting, but until they can have a space for YOU you don\u2019t need to apologize or explain why you sleep at your Moms.", "NTA. 17 vs <10 is a huge age gap. I have two younger sisters, one six years younger, the other ten years younger. It\u2019s a no from me. The theft. The judgement. The audacity. I would never tell a teenage girl she\u2019s an asshole for not wanting to expose herself on a daily basis to pre-teens. Not to mention, 3 to a room? That\u2019s a bit excessive even under recession standards. Your space and comfort is important and valid. If there are other options for you at this time do not feel guilty for preferring them.", "NTA, it's pretty unreasonable for them to expect you to share a room like that. \n\nI wonder if the parents would be keen to share their toom with the 7yo and 9yo while you're over? Hmm funny about that....", "NTA - If your dad is bothered by the fact you do not stay to sleep when you visit, that's on him. I totally understand that, as a 17 yo, you would like some privacy in your own room. I think they should be happy that you at least still visit them in the situation.", "Nta", "NAH, it\u2019s reasonable you wouldn\u2019t want to share a room with two young children on a regular basis when you have your own space at your mom\u2019s house. You could stay over on weekends or small holidays and have a sleepover night, but during the school week it is understandable to want your space. Your dad\u2019s upset is understandable, but he shouldn\u2019t place any of that on you.", "NTA", "NAH. If you have a room waiting for you at your mom's, it's totally understandable to not share one at your dad's\n\n...as a father who is currently struggling to find a house that will give both my kids a room to call their own, the housing market is brutal and it takes a huge toll on a parent's heart to not be able to provide for our children. It kills me every time we lose out on a dream house because I don't have enough money.\n\nAs a kid, you may feel that your dad is upset at you for not staying, but it might be very likely that he is feeling like a failure who's too broke to even keep his daughter around.", "It is your father's responsibility to provide suitable living conditions for you. Despite his best intentions, he has failed to do so. The children might be his family, but they are not your and you are under no obligation to share a room with him. He chose to remarry and expand his family. He has to accept the responsibilities that come with those decisions and the consequences if he fails to do so.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and really, nobody is, but I wanted to stress that you aren't. Privacy is a big deal at your age and the situation is unfortunate, but you aren't doing anything wrong, and neither are they. It's just a sucky situation.", "You are NTA.  I\u2019m guessing your dad feels guilty because he\u2019s currently unable to provide a home for you.  You were his first baby and he knows that by his choices, he now doesn\u2019t have space for you and that makes him feel badly.  There\u2019s nothing you can or should do about that, it\u2019s his burden to carry as the adult.", "NAH\n\nYour dad is probably upset of the fact that you won't be spending as much time with him as you used to but I'm sure he understands which is why he hasn't pushed you to stay longer or even overnight.\n\nIt's perfectly understandable that you'd want your own space and privacy.\n\nI understand that your mom means well and has good intentions on wanting to encourage you to go and spend the night with your dad but I hope that she doesn't try and push you harder.\n\nPs. If you do end up spending some nights at your dad's place try and use some ear plugs for when you sleep, my husband is a really light sleeper himself and will wake up and any sound and uses those to sleep throughout some light noise.", "NAH.  That's life.", "NAH dad is understandably disappointed but it's reasonable that you want space at night especially at 17. Maybe consider rarely spending the night just to be nice to dad and have some extra bonding time with your stepsisters, but don't feel obligated to", "NAH. I totally get why you wouldn't want to do that, but I understand why your dad is sad. He wants more time with you, and I am glad he isn't pushing the issue. Is there a way to compromise? Could you stay nights with them when the kids are at their dad's house?", "NTA, is a tough spot to be in for sure. Might try sleeping on the couch on a weekend or two so it does not interfere with your studies.", "NAH\n\nIt's reasonable for you to want space, especially when the stepsisters are so much younger than you. But dad being sad about missing time with you is totally appropriate. \n\nMaybe try to compromise...spend the night every once in a while? Or try to do something special with your dad, or even your dad and the kids, to let him know you care and also help get to a more comfortable place with the step sisters.", "NTA -- your father made his choice, he has to live with it.\n\nDo they want you to babysit so they can go out?   Why do they care if you do not sleep there, if you visit", "NAH. I get not wanting to share a room when they are only stepsiblings, but there are families that siblings do share a room. Even step siblings. It sounds like your family is doing the best they can and they miss having the over nights with you. That doesn\u2019t make them AHs either.", "NTA \u2013 but for the karma of the relationship, since it sounds like he like your dad, you might think about staying over once a week or twice a month.", "NTA", "NTA but your dad and his wife are", "Does he have a nice couch? My niece doesnt go to her dads enough for a room so she was happy with the couch on those times she did go. I dont mean like 3 times a week on the couch, just whenever you feel like hanging longer you could just couch it? I dunno it seems better than never getting to stay overnight again", "NAH, there's nothing wrong with not wanting to share especially with two younger girls you aren't all that close with. Your dad is rightfully upset which any parent would be if their kid wouldn't want to stay with him but it seems this is a situation that's a bit out of his control. The rental market is pretty terrible atm and money is a big factor. at least he is being understanding about you not wanting to be there. Your mum shouldn't force you to go though, maybe have a talk to her about your reasons and see what can be done in the future to work around problems like this.", "NAH. Sucks that your dads situation has changed, but also understandable that you would look to sleep over and share with two other (much younger) kids. \n\nWhat is the situation with your step sisters and their father? If they have shared custody then could you stay when they are with their dad?", "NTA I understand and I am sure your dad does to that at 17 you need your privacy. And that there is a big age difference between you and his step daughters. \n\nHe probably understands that at your age school is harder and you need rest during the week.\n\nYou said your open to having a better relationship with the 2 girls. Why not trying 1 marathon movie night a month with the family. Family makes snack food. You three girls make a bed in the living room. See if your dad and step mom would like to join and enjoy one whole night. It doesn\u2019t have to be every weekend, it can be one night a month when no one has plans. I know at your age going out with friends is a big deal. So just when you have a free night. I am sure your dad and especially your step siblings would appreciate the kindness of trying to be closer to them.", "It's reasonable you don't want to stay overnight there, and it's reasonable your dad is upset about it. It's even reasonable that your mom thinks you should stay over, the custody is supposed to be 50/50. NAH", "You are very young, and yet practically an adult. Im guessing you are used to being an only child. What I would ask you to consider is what relationship do you want with your dad and his family moving forward? Sounds like your parents have given you a great foundation with their coparenting.   \n\n\nWhat I would caution you is to not alienate yourself. Or start a self dialogue of being pushed out. Own your choice,  consequences and all. Not staying over will cause a rift. Feelings of exclusion on both sides. Be aware and take responsibility for that. I think there is plenty of love on all sides. Maybe a monthly \u201cslumber party\u201d. You can build the new relationships and maintain the one you and your dad already have.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe pick a weekend and stay and make it a fun overnight thing? \n\nIt really sounds like your parents are both doing their best, tbh.", "NAH", "This is a very black and white outlook and not fair to the circumstances at hand. \n\nObviously, if OP\u2019s dad\u2019s family downsized, they didn\u2019t do it willingly. A lot of families have been impacted by current economic conditions, and I imagine this family was as well. \n\nNo parent wants to squeeze all their kids into one room. When they don\u2019t have the means to do otherwise, it\u2019s sad but it doesn\u2019t make the parents AHs. \n\nSimilarly, it doesn\u2019t make OP the AH to want her own room. I imagine her dad is upset more at the circumstances than at his daughter. Having to downsize isn\u2019t easy and it leaves a feeling of inadequacy, so he\u2019s probably struggling with that. As long as he\u2019s not taking it out OP or enforcing rules that require her to stay, then I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the AH either. \n\nThat being said, maybe worth a discussion between OP and her dad. If her dad is feeling like he\u2019s missing out on time with her, then that can be addressed in other ways.", "I have to say, while you're right, this is NAH. Dad hasn't been stressing OP, he's just upset. He's allowed to have an emotional reaction to his daughter not wanting to stay with him, on top of the economic stress associated with having to downsize. He probably feels like a failure. That doesn't make him an AH.", "\u201cI wonder if the parents would be keen to share their toom with the 7yo and 9yo while you\u2019re over? Hmm funny about that\u2026.\u201d\n\nThis statement is ridiculous.  A child is not entitled to their own room.   Parents sharing a room with a child is outlandish (unless that is only housing they can afford)!", "major apples and oranges and you know that", "it can be both.  her dad can also validly be upset his daughter refuses to stay there and he's allowed to feel that", "I agree.

OP seems very mature & kind for her age - def NTA.", "This is a good compromise but no more than once a month for your sake", "For a weekend?  Why cant anyone  else sleep in living room?", "yea, true", "Why? There are regular visits happening.", "why, because they can't afford a bigger place? that doesn't make them, or anyone else struggling financially right now, assholes.  However calling them assholes for that does make *you* one", "She is NOT alienating herself.  Her dad did that, by taking away her room.   A slumber party with much younger kids is unpaid babysitting.\n\nHer dad has prioritized his stepkids. It is on him", "This. Maybe OP can meet her dad for lunch, etc.   But her staying over is not working for her, and he has to accept that.", "That's probably why they gave the NAH judgement.", "From the post, it sounds like money got tight and Dad had to move into a more affordable place with only two bedrooms as opposed to three. How is that prioritizing the stepkids?", "Downsize happened to the whole family. No one was choosing to take anything away. Or give to someone else. \n\n my vision of a slumber party is obv different than yours. I see a family activity, indoor camping. Games, movies, food. The five of them together being silly. That is not babysitting. It is however a way to build a relationship especially with disparate ages and financial constraints. \n\nno where in her post does she refer to feeling replaced. Just not comfortable in this new dynamic.", "In general, younger kids love being with older ones.  Older ones does not like this.  Can stepsisters never stay with their dad or other relatives?", "Well, mom and dad got to keep their room, right?\n\nThere is hard to find an activity that works for these age differences.  We do not know if dad wants to skip out", "We were not provided with that detail. Who knows, maybe the other parent isn't in the picture anymore. It wasn't a significant enough point for OP to present. But saying that a financial hardship means that dad is prioritizing the stepkids is a bit of a stretch. It isn't like the two girls each get their own room and OP has to share with one when she comes over - in fact, at the previous home, OP got her own room and the sisters shared a room. Now there is only one room. They still have a roof over their heads and dad isn't forcing OP to stay.", "Somehow, the ONLY One who has to sacrifice is OP.   Asking the two younger girls to share a room is not a big deal.", "Then please let me know your solution. There is ONLY one room."]}
