You don't have my permission to use this anywhere else.\n\nSo I am part of a group of friends. I'm in my early thirties and a woman. We've all known each other for varying amounts of time. Some people are closer than others. We get all together every month but obviously some people see each other more often. We normally go for drinks or dinner. \n\nOne friend, Kelly (29F) I am not really close to. I normally see her as part of the big group. Kelly just had a baby about 7 months ago and seems to be struggling as her husband works long hours. She hasn't come out with all of us but I've still seen her once in a while. \n\nI've started to pull back a bit from my friendship with Kelly and a few others have as well. Any time we've gone over there (I live close to her and another friend), she sort of treats us like unpaid labor but says this is just part of being friends. When I'm there she'll ask one of us to hold the baby or do dishes or run a load of laundry. I have enough of all this to do on my own (minus the baby) so I kind of get a little pissed off going over to someone's house and doing chores every single time. I don't mind helping out but it's a little crazy. \n\nShe asked to borrow something of mine yesterday and I went over to drop it off. While I was there she asked if I wouldn't mind mopping the kitchen for her. I told her I was in a hurry and she got a bit huffy. She told me that raising a child was hard and she needed \"her village\" to step up and help her. I kind of had enough and told her that I didn't want to be part of her village. This really set her off and I walked out the door and haven't spoken to her. \n\nAITA here? Some of my friends are saying that yeah I should have just kept my distance instead of saying anything.

I\u2019m a mother of 4. One of which had huge separation anxiety and still does to a point at 5. I baby wore in order to do chores. Now I\u2019m partly disabled and have a friend that volunteered to come help me with my house but I would never ask/demand someone watch my kids or clean my house for me! It\u2019s rude!", "Here's a scene from an alternate timeline:  \n\n\nYou remain in \"the village\", and do chores for Kelly every time you visit. She calls you to come over and \"help out\", she feels fully comfortable borrowing anything and everything, including money. These things are rarely returned promptly or in the same condition, if at all. A dynamic that started out as helping a new mother has continued well into the child's school years. Kelly's baby is now in second grade, and she still expects the same kind of \"help\" from the village, including paying for field trips and Christmas presents.   \n\n\nNow you're a new mother. A few weeks in, you call Kelly and ask if she could help you tidy up around the house.   \n\n\n\"LOL, of course not. You know I'd love to, but I'm far too busy with my child.\"", "NTA\n\nPeople forget teh whole \"village\" concept includes,and centers on, generations of the same family first, neighbours second.  Friends have no obligation to raise your child, or to do your chores.", "NTA\n\nShe's taking the \"village\" thing a bit far.  No one wants to visit a friend and do their chores for them.", "Fyi: just saying no permission doesn't make it illegal to repost. You don't own anything you post on Reddit, Reddit does. Read the TOS.", "In my experience, the village comes and helps. The village offers help first\u2014not asked first. The village just shows up. \n\nYou are not part of the village. You did not come out and say, hey let me know if you need any help. You did not drop by to assist them further than the loan. You are like a neighboring village. NTA. Nothing wrong with not being part of the village.", "I'm going with NTA but it sounds like she's really struggling and seeking out the help she needs and if you aren't feeling it let her know but also let your other friends know she might need help and find ways to get it for her.", "NTA. Expecting a guest to mop your floor?! The cheek of her!", "That's INSANE!  Who does that?? Asked you to mop her floor??  Holding a baby... Maybe.... But \" Do my Chores!\"  Cause you'd rather not hold a baby.....  There is no ***In Lieu Of***  for not doing.  A.  You MUST DO B.   NTA\nVillage My Arse!!!  She needs to find a new villiage.", "Lmao nta. Me and my husband both work full time jobs while raising 2 kids under 2 and don\u2019t make our friend do chores when they come over. If someone offers to help I\u2019ll take it but no way shape or form will I make someone do my household chore. She\u2019s the AH.", "NTA - Asking you to mop the floor when you dropped by to loan her something is a big ask on top of you already doing a favor. At 7 months parents are usually past needing somebody to swing by to hold the baby so they can shower and eat (which is legit in the first few months). I'd maybe politely inquire of somebody closer to her if she's having postpartum issues as this is an odd ask at this stage. Perhaps suggest they encourage her to talk to her doctor if things are still this overwhelming for her.", "Clearly nta, her behavior is just rude. You got your own housework", "Tell her to suck it.", "NTA, she decided to have a baby then she deals with the consequences of raising said baby, I don't care what anyone says.", "She could have been trailing afterbirth and I still would not have suited up as her Handy Dandy Maid Service. That is the rudest thing I have ever heard of a friend seeking from someone right after they ambushed them? \n\nMy life can be exhausting and just consumes me sometimes. I don't have energy to be a villager many days of the week. And people who've had babies need to look to their partners as the primary support \"staff.\"\n\nNo way I am scrubbing floors at best friend's house and I haven't had time to scrub my own floors at home. C'mon.\n\nNTA.", " >You don't have my permission to use this anywhere else.\n\nWhere else would it be used?", "I was inclined to say Y T A first because parents definitely need a village, but run her laundry and MOP HER KITCHEN!??? She\u2019s not looking for a village, she\u2019s looking for maids.\n\nNTA!", "NTA. \n\nThe it takes a village mentality is great if everyone agrees to be \u201cthe village.\u201d Stating you never agreed to that role is very direct. It might sound harsh, but she clearly hasn\u2019t picked up on the subtle hints you and others are dropping by pulling away so blunt honesty is what she\u2019s left you with. (Especially because she\u2019s demanding help and expressing entitlement to it.) \n\nPlus- If she\u2019s a friend who expects the world from her friends, but never returns it\u2026she\u2019s in for a rude awakening when she eventually has no friends. People aren\u2019t entitled to a village; you earn it.", "Was the pregnancy all about her and her needs too?

I had 2 kids under 4 and my husband was always at work. He worked extremely long hours. So house work and the kids was on me. I can count on maybe 1 hand having someone come in and help me. Then I didn\u2019t ask they just knew I was getting ready to have a party for my child and wanted to help out.", "Right, like the whole \"village\" thing isn't even meant to be taken so literally that you need ALL these people to raise ONE child. It's not \"*my* village\", it's *the* village that everyone is a *part* of. Unless the mom is also offering her own help for everyone else's business, it's parasitic. \n\nThe village idiom is an economy of scale thing, for labor. A group of (let's say) 10 parents working together are more effective at raising their 10 kids, than each parent doing their own thing and trying to raise just their own child. One adult can make a meal for one person but there are many dishes that can be expanded to feed *many* people at once, with only a little extra labor compared to making it as a single portion meal. Likewise if one person's doing a lot of laundry, one person teaching several children, one person locking down everybody's sweeping/mopping, and so on, rather than *everyone* needing to do *everything* for themselves.", "Exactly.  And floor mopping is a big chore. OP is not her ride-or-die bestie; she's just a basic friend.", "Asking the real questions.  Seriously.", "Man, if someone asked me to mop in this context I\u2019m probably gonna turn around and go home. I\u2019ve 100% mopped and done other cleaning for loved ones, but usually there is a plan and a dire need. Like when my friend was in the hospital for a month with her baby I wasn\u2019t letting her come home to a dusty home and empty fridge, you know? But OP\u2019s friend sounds entitled as hell. \n\nThat \u201cit takes a village\u201d phrase gets weaponized a lot."]}
