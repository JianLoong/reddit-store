You don't have my permission to use this anywhere else.\n\nSo I am part of a group of friends. I'm in my early thirties and a woman. We've all known each other for varying amounts of time. Some people are closer than others. We get all together every month but obviously some people see each other more often. We normally go for drinks or dinner. \n\nOne friend, Kelly (29F) I am not really close to. I normally see her as part of the big group. Kelly just had a baby about 7 months ago and seems to be struggling as her husband works long hours. She hasn't come out with all of us but I've still seen her once in a while. \n\nI've started to pull back a bit from my friendship with Kelly and a few others have as well. Any time we've gone over there (I live close to her and another friend), she sort of treats us like unpaid labor but says this is just part of being friends. When I'm there she'll ask one of us to hold the baby or do dishes or run a load of laundry. I have enough of all this to do on my own (minus the baby) so I kind of get a little pissed off going over to someone's house and doing chores every single time. I don't mind helping out but it's a little crazy. \n\nShe asked to borrow something of mine yesterday and I went over to drop it off. While I was there she asked if I wouldn't mind mopping the kitchen for her. I told her I was in a hurry and she got a bit huffy. She told me that raising a child was hard and she needed \"her village\" to step up and help her. I kind of had enough and told her that I didn't want to be part of her village. This really set her off and I walked out the door and haven't spoken to her. \n\nAITA here? Some of my friends are saying that yeah I should have just kept my distance instead of saying anything.

I've never asked her to do anything because I have my own shit handled. LoL", "You are absolutely right lol", "THIS - she has an interesting definition of \"village\" lol. At most I thought it was calling friends/family for help with children, sharing things like baby equipment, and dropping off food for overly tired parents etc. I never knew that village included laundry, mopping, dishwashing etc etc. I mean in that case, I need to find myself a village pronto (and I don't have kids lol).", "It\u2019s not your floor, not your responsibility", "Oh I didn't leave it there.

For instance I went to visit my friend with a newborn and I made her laugh and she literally thrust her baby at me because she was about to pee herself. While it's not a requirement I think when you go visit someone with a newborn there is an expectation that you would want to hold them at least for a second and that there may be a situation where they may need you to hold them for a second, especially if only the two of you are there.\n\nMy reply was a question because I would not think that I would ever invite someone over to my house when I had a newborn that it was not comfortable with letting them hold my baby.", "Love this.", "Lol that sounds like a whole different set of problems.", "Well yeah of course I would never want a stranger to hold my kid but my comment was more about friends coming over to visit.", "I might want to visit my *friend* who had a newborn, and still feel **absolutely** NO desire to hold the baby.\n\nQuestion - do you only make that assumption about the women you know, or do you expect your male friends to *want to hold the baby?", "I would expect every person of every gender to want to hold a baby.

She's asking for help.", "That\u2019s true, but OP didn\u2019t choose to have kids nor are Kelly\u2019s responsibilities OP\u2019s. We also don\u2019t know what responsibilities they have on their plate. Just because they are child-free doesn\u2019t mean they are lying around eating bon bons all day, but, even if they were, that doesn\u2019t mean they should feel guilty about their life choices.", "I have kids. My expectations of my friends were and continue to be don't let them die while I'm on the toilet and ignore the mess. \n\nThat's it. \n\nIt is absolutely no one else's responsibility to handle the housework for me regardless of how much harder it is with a small human around. Offers of help are super welcome and asking for help occasionally is fine, but the issue with OPs friend is that there is a level of entitlement there - she feels she is entitled to take up OPs time and expects help with clearly zero consideration for OPs time and energy, and it's pretty obvious this is not an occasional request thing, but rather everytime she's at friend's house.", "Yeah but you make the decision to have kids. You don\u2019t get to decide if you have to do laundry or not \ud83d\ude02", "Agree. Im also child-free but I work insane hours and get the housework done. But I know from my best friends with babies that my struggles to get everything done are nothing compared to theirs. They have small windows of time that they can clean while managing sleep deprivation and hormonal changes. It\u2019s fine for OP to not want to help but it sounds ignorant to assume that the workload is the same.", "THIS. This is what my girlfriends and I did for each other: we\u2019d bring a home-cooked meal, send Mama to take a shower or nap, and we would wash bottles, run a load of towels, or something else small that still was something Mama wouldn\u2019t have to worry about. (I live in the US so usually only the mother gets parental leave.) We really didn\u2019t even ask what we could do because we knew we would be told \u201cnothing.\u201d We certainly weren\u2019t mopping or anything, though!", "She wasn\u2019t the one that was offended tho, her friend was when OP said she was in a hurry. And she has done chores for her in the past.", "It didn't sound like asking to me.", "Should we just cut people out of our lives if they're not comfortable holding our babies?", "> My expectations of my friends were and continue to be don't let them die while I'm on the toilet and ignore the mess.\n\nI laughed so hard and now I want to be your friend.", "The mopping is a weird request.  You can do that with a kid strapped to you.  Luckily, things have changed.  My son in law took parental leave, in the US (CA).  That wasn\u2019t an option for my friends and I.", "I was looking for this comment! Exactly. \n\nOP was asked to loan something. She brought it to the friend. The friend said, \u201cWould you mind mopping while you are here?\u201d *while* OP was doing her the favor of loaning an item and bringing it to her house. That is so weird to ask! Mopping isn\u2019t a quick task.", "No, normal people do not have that expectation. I have child care experience from nannying for many years, but I never work with babies because I am not a fan of being vomited on. I have many friends with babies. I love visiting with them and I actually don\u2019t mind mopping ha. But no one, literally not ONE of my friends, has ever even offered to let me hold the baby and I have never asked. I ask them to sit, I ask them to let me get them food/drink, etc. But my friends only offer up their babies if someone specifically asks to hold it. I also don\u2019t touch pregnant women so\u2026", "Just because someone visits me with my baby by no means they should expect me to hand over the baby. Wtf of an expectation is that?", "EXACTLY. If I visit a friend with little ones and they need help it isn\u2019t with holding their baby. They should get to enjoy that.", "I neither have nor want babies. I adore them and am great at caring for them. Expecting everyone to want to hold a baby is bizarre.", "Love this response \ud83d\udc4f \nI have kids and would never expect anyone to hold my kids when they were babies. That's just stupid. \n\nIf someone wants to hold a child, they'll definitely talk about wanting to hold a child. Also for op, it is weird to expect someone to clean your house for them because \"baby/village\"", "NAH. \n\nI come from a culture where no one would ever visit a new mom empty handed and never leave without having done something useful for her. For at least the first year, I always expect that visiting a friend means doing her dishes, folding a load of laundry or cleaning her bathroom or taking out her trash or whatever else needs to be done. People have done that with me as well when I had babies. \n\nMeanwhile, I'm very aware that some cultures don't do that and some people even have opposite beliefs and would be very offended at the idea of anyone trying to help them or by being asked to help. \n\nEach type of culture (and culture doesn't have to mean ethnicity, different families or friend groups can have their own cultural practices) has good and bad sides and one isn't superior to the other. You just have different perspectives. \n\nWhile no one is the asshole in this interaction where the misunderstanding escalated, the next steps are where it really matters. Ideally, you both should find some room for compromise and each should explain to the other how you view the role of friends in supporting each other.", "NTA whoever brought back \"the village\" to modern parents deserves to be caned.\n\nSo many modern entitled parents use the \"village\" to extort free labour.", "Lol @ \u201cyou dont have my permission\u201d lol okay", "A bit off topic, but can anyone tell me why reading 'you can't use this anywhere else' immediately give me the desire to do so?", "Nta. She chose her life. She seems to just volunteer anyone for village life. Not your kid either.", "NTA. But man, something tells me the friend group is not going to remain the same much longer - you got the entitled member, some people who don't like rocking the boat, and you, who doesn't want to take shit from the entitled one.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. Good grief. It kills me how people will put some happy horseshit label on bad behavior to make it seem acceptable. She\u2019s not entitled to your labor just because she wants it.", "NTA-\n\nJust curious, how does Kelly plan for the village to work if everyone has young children at the same time?  That happens in lots of friend groups.  Do you have to fight it out for who gets their house cleaned by the villagers?  Should you compare stretch marks and hours of labor for bonus points?  Are c-section and episiotomy stitch counts included in the competition?", "NTA she\u2019s delusional.", "NTA. Ask her when She will bring anything to the table. Because people who eats more than their fair share of every dish yet brings nothing will soon find themself uninvited.", "NTA. She can't treat everyone like the help without their consent.\n\nBTW this sub is public and writing \"You don't have my permission to use this anywhere else\" has no legal standing.", "What the hell? Mop her floor? Lol. NTA. Friends aren\u2019t free labor.", "NTA. This lady is crazy. While it sucks her husband isn\u2019t helping, that doesn\u2019t mean other people should pick up the slack. I have a 3 month old and can\u2019t imagine asking someone to mop my floors for me.", "NTA. Here's the thing about villages: they don't belong to any one person, and they don't exist to support any one person. They're webs of mutual, reciprocal relationships where you help me AND I help you and then we both help Jen down the street get the squirrel out of her fireplace and sometimes she brings cookies to Fred next door who helped me find my lost dog. Back and forth, over and over, without keeping score or making bonkers demands. \n\nKelly does not seem to be into this for reciprocity. She's in it for the free labor. To test this suspicion, invite her over for drinks and give her laundry to fold. I'm guessing you're her village, but she's not yours.", "NTA and Kelly are taking advantage and it makes me wonder how entitled the friends and acquaintances who say you are the problem. I mean who goes up to people and says do my laundry. That has never been a thing. Offering to help a struggling mom is one thing but this isn't it.", "NTA. It was better to be upfront than to ghost her.", "NTA. A lot of people - including Reddit because I've seen people here say it too - get that saying completely wrong.\n\nSure, it might take a village to raise a kid. It's on the parents to foster and grow and have that village. The saying doesn't give them the right to conscript people to be part of that village, and it certainly doesn't magically create any obligations on anyone else.", "I\u2019m confused. How did taking care of her baby and living space become your responsibility? NTA", "NTA. Friends are not unpaid labor. A helping hand isn\u2019t an expectation or an obligation.", "Your NTA. I have kids and while yeah it can be hard, I never once asked someone to do chores for me. In fact I had people offer but I would say no, I got this. Choosing to be a parent comes with the understanding that you still have to do all the normal life tasks as well as being responsible for raising a human.", "What??! I am so mad, at myself! I didn\u2019t know I could have friends and acquaintances to my home to clean it for me. We\u2019ve been doing that ourselves like fools, apparently. There\u2019s been a few times where there was a service hired, but that was unfortunately not long standing. Where the heck are my village people?! \nSeriously, though, NtA!! She\u2019s nuts, village to hold the baby while she does her household chores. Babysit while she sees the doctor, or self care, or whatever, and always scheduled in advance.", "NTA Imagine asking a favor to borrow something, then when the person brings it you randomly ask them to mop your floor! That's not even a quick, easy thing like, \"Will you watch the baby for a second while I pee,\" That's a big job.", "NTA-her imposing on you is rude and inconsiderate. Its not your baby. She knows she\u2019s using you and others for help under the guise of friendship; dont be fooled people like that know what they\u2019re doing in these cases 100% of the time. Dont feel bad for setting a boundary-its normal for someone like her who doesn\u2019t respect boundaries to get upset when someone sets one\u2026almost like a baby.", "NTA. Kelly sure is an entitled one. That's now how the village works, and she damn well knows it. The village is there to help her take a break from the child, not do slave labour for the mistress of the house", "I read a book about this once before.  Can\u2019t remember the name of it, but the gist was \u201chow to have it all and get it everything done as a woman\u201d and the advice was essentially \u201cexploit others\u201d.  I couldn\u2019t believe the author\u2019s audacity in writing the book.  No good advice in it, unless you were willing to take advantage of other people at every opportunity.  Sounds like your friend may have read this book.", "I can not upvote my fellow mothers who see this like that enough.", "I mean true, but it's super annoying to see these end up in lazy magazines and newspapers by college dropouts who make clickbait for a living. I don't blame OP at all for saying that.", "Every time someone posts that I have an overwhelming urge to screenshot and post everywhere. Facebook, twitter, yelp reviews, Imdb\u2026.", "It's not a compromise when she asks to borrow something, needs you to drop it off, and then gives you additional chores when you arrive. She was setting you up to be tasked. Kiss her and whatever item she borrowed goodbye and enjoy not being a doormat. NTA.", "Why are you going to her house? Someone with a baby, someone you know is having a hard time? She doesn\u2019t have time nie the energy to entertain, most people would get that without being told?", "Also ignore the other comments here. Even if someone was a friend - if they tried to order me to mop their fucking kitchen when I'm already over there doing them a favour? They're no longer a friend because they've turned themselves into a user.", "She was already borrowing stuff from you that you dropped off at her door. How is that not helping? Yeesh.", "Mopping floors is something you would agree to do?  Y/ou are a saint.  kt", "Amazon reviews for mops.", "Well one with a dirty floor\u2026", "She was dropping something off that the mom asked to borrow. Also, the mom offered to entertain at her home with others likely to get free housework", "Omfg", "That\u2019s one time\u2026 \n\u201canytime we\u2019ve gone over there\u2026\u201d.", "OMG this. Just let me pee in peace for the love of God", "I chose not to have kids, but I'm not thinking parents' lives are just the same as my child-free one. That's my point.", "I agree \ud83d\udcaf", "Christ. No wonder AITA judgments are so fucking skewed when it's filled with people like you.", "I have had both the differences are often negligible. Though dogs are easier to take outside.", "No you shouldn't. I never said or even implied that.", "Yeah we get that you\u2019re child free. My point is that it\u2019s not fair to expect household chores or childcare from others when they didn\u2019t decide to have the baby. It\u2019s not a \u201cwho has it harder\u201d contest", "Meh - I\u2019d rather hold a puppy", "No I didn't say that. You really made a leap there."]}
