You don't have my permission to use this anywhere else.\n\nSo I am part of a group of friends. I'm in my early thirties and a woman. We've all known each other for varying amounts of time. Some people are closer than others. We get all together every month but obviously some people see each other more often. We normally go for drinks or dinner. \n\nOne friend, Kelly (29F) I am not really close to. I normally see her as part of the big group. Kelly just had a baby about 7 months ago and seems to be struggling as her husband works long hours. She hasn't come out with all of us but I've still seen her once in a while. \n\nI've started to pull back a bit from my friendship with Kelly and a few others have as well. Any time we've gone over there (I live close to her and another friend), she sort of treats us like unpaid labor but says this is just part of being friends. When I'm there she'll ask one of us to hold the baby or do dishes or run a load of laundry. I have enough of all this to do on my own (minus the baby) so I kind of get a little pissed off going over to someone's house and doing chores every single time. I don't mind helping out but it's a little crazy. \n\nShe asked to borrow something of mine yesterday and I went over to drop it off. While I was there she asked if I wouldn't mind mopping the kitchen for her. I told her I was in a hurry and she got a bit huffy. She told me that raising a child was hard and she needed \"her village\" to step up and help her. I kind of had enough and told her that I didn't want to be part of her village. This really set her off and I walked out the door and haven't spoken to her. \n\nAITA here? Some of my friends are saying that yeah I should have just kept my distance instead of saying anything. I think I might be the asshole because I was harsher than I needed to be to someone who was clearly having a rough time.", "created_utc": 1668983989, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0hnx0/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_part_of_a_friends/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't decide to have children and are under no obligation to help raise them.

They ought to think about their life choices, and come up with some better ways to live.\n\nTelling them rather than just silently dropping them might help them figure this out.\n\nNTA.\n\n(I help my friends and neighbors and local institutions all the time, but that's because I ask if they need some help.

Poor timing.", "NTA\n\nwho on earth thinks it is ok to ask people to mop their floors lol \n\nShe has misunderstood what it means to have a village...it is not about making others do your chores, it is about looking out for each other and keeping an eye on all the kids when out and about  Sure, it might be some traded off baby sitting or providing a meal ...but you have to give back, not just take.", "NTA. She needed to be told otherwise she'd keep doing it.\n\nNot once have I ever been asked to do chores in a friend's house and have never asked.", "NTA\n\nIt is understandable that she is going through a difficult time.\n\nBut neither are you his servant to do his housework.", "NTA\n\nYou are her friend, not free labor. If she only asked every once in awhile for help that's one thing. But expecting you to do chores at her home every time you come over is just ridiculous. If she seriously needs help like that she should be leaning on family, not friends.\n\nI understand that raising a child is rough, but you are by no means obligated to take care of her kid or do her house work. She should be thankful that you have helped her out as often as you've already done. Yet she blows up at you when you're letting her borrow something and you tell her you're in a hurry? That screams red flag.\n\nShe seems to view you less as a friend and more as convenient free labor. Don't feel bad telling her you don't want to be part of her village. There's a good chance if roles were reversed and you were in her place, she would probably never lift a finger to help you.", "NTA, she\u2019s using you and others.

I really don't care how many kids someone has, I'm still not doing housework for them.", "NTA, she got huffy coz you said you were in a hurry... thats a joke \"i need my village to step up\" hell no. Just no. If you have friends over and they offer help sure.. but even then, they can hold the baby or make faces at the baby while hes in a chair or having floor time and SHE can do HER chores..\n\nI have 3 step kids and a almost 1yr old boy and we get ALL of our chores done just fine and with me working nights.\n\nIf she needs help she can ask for it, but expecting her friends to \"step up\" would 100% have me opting out of contact with her and advising that others dont just accept her expectations.\n\nThis \"it takes a village\" BS just has people expecting others to help them and they get mad when they dont get exactly what they were expecting in their head..\n\nYour friends didnt decide you should have a kid\nYour friends didnt get you pregnant\nYour friends shouldnt have to raise your kid.\n\nThe next step would be expecting them to chip in on the bills..", "NTA. It does take a village. But all member need to be willing participants. Sometimes things get hectic and life is tough and your friends can be there for you. Sometimes it\u2019s time to put on your big girl pants and mop your own floor.", "NTA at all.  She's taking advantage of everyone and will run them off.  She just blatantly needs to come out and ask for help rather than trying to sneak the help in.", "Nta, you need to set boundaries with this woman and so should he friends.  He expectations are unreasonable.  You don't expect your friends to do chores for you,  and you don't get mad when they say no, especially when \n1.she asked \"would you mind if...\"\n2. You have helped her many times before,  \n3.  you are currently already doing her a favor by lending her something. \nMore of your friends should do what you do and tell her no, instead of tip toeing around her feelings. \n\nI will help out my friends with kids, but they also understand I have my own life and I'm not obligated to help them\nIf she wants some help with chores she needs to hire a mommy's helper or something on that thread , instead of weaseling free labor from her \"village\"", "NTA.  So tired of this.  You have kids, they are your responsibility.  Step parent here and we were in 100% when we had kids.  Someone needs a break, get a babysitter.  I will help with other people\u2019s kids, but visiting a friend to act as a maid/ babysitter, nope, never.", "NTA. And the community I was raised in was all about supporting everyone and selfless service. The key component was a vocal offer to help. If someone doesn't offer, asking is obnoxious, and expecting is even worse.", "NTA. She's got some odd ideas about the definition of friendship. It's bizarre to ask someone to do chores when they are simply coming over to visit. Stick to the boundary you set and distance yourself.", "NTA its okay to cut her off for being entitled", "\"Some of my friends are saying that yeah I should have just kept my distance instead of saying anything\"  \n\n\nIt's a bit hard to keep your distance when you're in her home and are being ambushd by yet another errand that you're supposed to do for her.\n\nNTA and I'm with you on the matter: Small things here and there are okay, but it seems like she either doesn't really have her life in order or she bit off more than she could chew with the baby and the long hours working partner.", "NTA, who does Kelly think she is? That's obnoxious.", "NTA \n\nIt seems she doesn\u2019t understand just who the village is and what they do for each other", "NTA. Exactly how much help is Kelly giving 'her village'? Sounds like it's a synonym for 'collection of suckers'.", "Nta\n\nBefore her baby, how active a member of the village was she? Did she stop by anyone's house to do chores, bring over food when they had a bad day, anything like that? \n\nI'll just guess the answer is a no. \n\nPeople like her only acknowledge the village when they want something, but will put up a stink if they are asked to contribute to the \"village\". The idea of the village is everyone helps each other, not everyone does everything for one person.", "NTA and I\u2019m a woman in a few friends group \u201cvillages\u201d\nif you will and this is a strange application of the term. I have cleaned for my friends and done errands for them and given things away for free to people in my community. I\u2019ve donated money towards gifts and causes. I\u2019ve never been asked to do a chore during a visit and would wonder if the person asking had lost their mind if it happened.\nI wonder where Kelly got this idea? Is this some TikTok shit?", "NTA. \n\nI had to go back and read the beginning because I thought maybe it said 7 weeks not 7 months. does she have other young kids at home already? If she\u2019s still struggling that much maybe she\u2019s silently crying for a different kind of help.", "NTA.  If you have to lie or pretend to keep a relationship going, it is better to just let the relationship go.", "The word friend covers a huge variety of relationships. For you, this woman is a group friend you go out to dinner with that you hang out with in a group whereas she thinks you guys are replacement siblings. If she needs help she needs to be hitting up the people she babysat for, not you. NTA.", "NTA. I helped my sis with this kind of stuff when he kids were babies, and I still help her out when I can, but she and I are BEST friends and sisters. For a casual friend/slightly more than an acquaintance? That's just a weird ask and seems like a pretty big imposition.", "This is a really key distinction. Even if you had volunteered to be in the village, it does not mean you are assigned chores when you stop by. \n\nI say this as a parent of small kids - Kelly hasn\u2019t accepted that it just sucks sometimes, and your house will be messier.

I don't know.", "I mean you'll have to wait until after I do mine! That's my biggest issue. She kind of acts like the rest of us haven't been working and juggling other stuff while also getting our house work done.", "In all fairness, she has babysit a lot for other friends. I've never asked her to do anything because I have my own shit handled. LoL", "You are absolutely right lol", "THIS - she has an interesting definition of \"village\" lol. At most I thought it was calling friends/family for help with children, sharing things like baby equipment, and dropping off food for overly tired parents etc. I never knew that village included laundry, mopping, dishwashing etc etc. I mean in that case, I need to find myself a village pronto (and I don't have kids lol).", "It\u2019s not your floor, not your responsibility", "Oh I didn't leave it there. I took it with me.", "Yeah, I always snort a little when I see that.", "I read that and I wad like ok? Whats stopping anyone? Absolutely nothing\u2026 Lmao", "I will give her credit where it's due. She did babysit for quite a few of the moms often. I've personally never asked her for anything and haven't needed any help so I'm not sure if she would ever \"give back\" to me if I need it.", "I think she just grossly misinterpreted the term village. Someone in the friend group broke their leg last year and people would come over and help clean (myself included) because they were physically incapable of doing it at the time and lived by themselves. I'm not sure if she is equating having a newborn to not being able to use her leg or what.", "Nope this is her first. Her husband is in law or something like that and works super long hours so she is basically a one woman show at home.", "I agree. I don't think she is going to get \"voted off the island\" or anything like that but a few people have definitely been turned off by her attitude.", "It's not that.  She doesn't want to do her freakin' chores.  I was relieved when someone Didn't want to hold my baby b/c it seemed like everyone did and then you have to worry about a whole other set of things!", "I get that, and it's great that she's helped others. However, you are well within your rights to decline and are not wrong or an AH for not wanting to be a babysitter for her. \n\nEspecially since you've never asked her for any favors, and therefore aren't obligated to provide childcare for her if you don't want to.", "That was a good idea! :)", "Boom, then there's her village. \n\nHowever, I don't know if you plan on having children or not, but if you do, keep in mind you might want to be part of it. If you're child free, way less of a problem.", "You would invite people over that you weren't comfortable with holding your baby?", "Luckily she hasn't pushed that boundary! She asked once and I told her (kindly) that I wasn't great with kids and didn't babysit and she never asked again.", "LoL I am not. I got dogs instead.", "Do you think people coming over to your house are required to hold your baby? I'm afraid I don't understand your comment.", "Sadly, yes.  My ex called her mom, but those stories are too many for one post.", "Strangers wanted to hold my baby.  I mean, I get it, but I would never ask.", "No they aren't required. But when you have a new baby and people come over it's expected that it might come up that you might have to hold the baby for a second. For instance I went to visit my friend with a newborn and I made her laugh and she literally thrust her baby at me because she was about to pee herself. While it's not a requirement I think when you go visit someone with a newborn there is an expectation that you would want to hold them at least for a second and that there may be a situation where they may need you to hold them for a second, especially if only the two of you are there.\n\nMy reply was a question because I would not think that I would ever invite someone over to my house when I had a newborn that it was not comfortable with letting them hold my baby.", "Love this.", "Lol that sounds like a whole different set of problems.", "Well yeah of course I would never want a stranger to hold my kid but my comment was more about friends coming over to visit.", "I might want to visit my *friend* who had a newborn, and still feel **absolutely** NO desire to hold the baby.\n\nQuestion - do you only make that assumption about the women you know, or do you expect your male friends to *want to hold the baby?", "I would expect every person of every gender to want to hold a baby. I don't even have or want kids but I think there is a bit of joy with holding a baby. It's especially great when you can give that baby back if it starts crying.", "So you, who have no children and want none, are telling us that those of us who do **not** find joy in holding a baby would not be welcome in your house after your non-existent baby is born?"]}
