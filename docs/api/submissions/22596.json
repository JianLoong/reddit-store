Only problem was I was 15 pounds too heavy for it and I bawled my eyes out because I knew this was the dress for me. Everyone was encouraging and I still had plenty of time to lose 15 pounds and come back for fitting etc so I agreed and said yes to the dress. \n\n\nWhen I got home that night I noticed on my SILs Instagram that she has posted a picture to her Instagram of me in the dress ugly crying and I was absolutely livid. My fianc\u00e9 has already seen the Instagram picture and I am devastated, he was not supposed to see me in the dress until our wedding day and I know so many more people have seen it!\n\nI could not help myself I called her and exploded adding that she was not going to be in my bridal party and that she has ruined my wedding. \nMy mother has called me and told me that even though she understands I lacked compassion and have severely hurt my SILs feelings. She asked if I could find it in my heart to forgive but I told her even if I did that I still would not include her in my party. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: My brother reached out to me to apologize on my SILs behalf. He stated that she posted it thinking the app had the feature to where she could post privately. I have never seen this on Instagram or knew it was possible BUT when I asked why the picture was taken in the first place he said she just wanted to capture the start of my \u201cfitting into the dress\u201d journey.

Your actions are limited - I already know throwing her from the wedding may just fan the flames. Instead, I would cage her with responcibility. Give her certain tasks for things you don't actually care about or need done, tell everyone she's doing it and how great she'll do it, all while providing as little control and choice otherwise.

Then posting it on Instagram? \n\nNo, she knew what she was doing. There's just no way.", "That's what she definitely thought when she was posting it. That plus some body shaming comments", "Seriously -even if this has nothing to do with a wedding, what an absolute dick move to post a picture like that.", "Yep. This woman is working her and the brother. Worse things are in store for this op in future if she doesn't become smart rn. She needs to bring her own mother to her own side now.", "Op take note. It's not just that one pic. \nRemember - continuous and repeated attempts", "Yep. At this point op shouldn't worry about one wedding but the future, like inheritance and stuff. She already made the op look mean in front of her brother and mother, after she actively sabotaged her. \nDid our op do something in her wedding or did the bro marry a psycho?"]}
