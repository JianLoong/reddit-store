I could understand so I agreed. \n\nBUT my SIL has been nothing short of a nightmare. My bridesmaid all assisted in handwriting and sending out our wedding invitations, but the ones my SIL helped with all had zero invitation inside and instead was an empty envelope (I know they were hers because everyone had different shades of pink envelopes to go from).\nShe also took the longest at our makeup and hair consultations even extending her appointment an hour (to which I was charged\u2014 I am covering her expenses as she is a SAHM and I know things are tight right now) because she could not agree with the stylist on what makeup she wanted. \n\nBut the final straw came when I found the dress of my dreams. Only problem was I was 15 pounds too heavy for it and I bawled my eyes out because I knew this was the dress for me. Everyone was encouraging and I still had plenty of time to lose 15 pounds and come back for fitting etc so I agreed and said yes to the dress. \n\n\nWhen I got home that night I noticed on my SILs Instagram that she has posted a picture to her Instagram of me in the dress ugly crying and I was absolutely livid. My fianc\u00e9 has already seen the Instagram picture and I am devastated, he was not supposed to see me in the dress until our wedding day and I know so many more people have seen it!\n\nI could not help myself I called her and exploded adding that she was not going to be in my bridal party and that she has ruined my wedding. \nMy mother has called me and told me that even though she understands I lacked compassion and have severely hurt my SILs feelings. She asked if I could find it in my heart to forgive but I told her even if I did that I still would not include her in my party.

I'd have been tempted to bounce her from the wedding.\n\nNTA at all. \n\nEqually excited to hear why your mother is defending your SIL.", "Wow...so SIL posted a humiliating pic of you on IG, in the wedding dress she knew you chose...and you're the one who lacks compassion?!?! Sorry, it's more like SIL and your mother are both devoid of compassion for you!\n\nYou are so NTA, but they (or anyone else who think what SIL did was ok) are!!", "NTA, tell them you will forgive her when she finds and pays for your new DREAM wedding dress. The new dress, so you can see the look of joy and surprise on your fiance's face when he sees you in your dress for the 1st time. Tell them you will forgive her when she earns your forgiveness.", "Wait stop! So you lacked compassion?! Not SIL and your mother?\nNTA and THEY owe you a sincere apology, not the other way around\u2026", "NTA, I would absolutely uninvite her.", "NTA. I usually don\u2019t have much sympathy for whiny brides, but this is an extreme case. No member of the wedding party should be posting advance pics, and certainly not one of the bride when she is stressed out and crying. You were right to boot her sorry ass.", "NTA\n\nThis woman sounds like a narcassist. Based on her actions, I'm just gonna assume she's some brand of Salty and is just doing little things to get back at you. I warn you that I think she will continue to use your emotional reactions against you, being careful to create upsetting circumstances that help her actions to appear accidental or misconstrued. Your actions are limited - I already know throwing her from the wedding may just fan the flames. Instead, I would cage her with responcibility. Give her certain tasks for things you don't actually care about or need done, tell everyone she's doing it and how great she'll do it, all while providing as little control and choice otherwise. I think your only weapon is to use her love for attention and looking good in front if others against her. Unwatched, she'll poison your wine and blame the vinyard.", "NTA your mom is the reason your in this position. She needs to stay out of it.", "Nta but boy is your mom a major problem here. She should not be defending this piece of work or choosing her over you. I\u2019m so sorry that you are dealing with this op. Good luck.", "NTA tell your mum to keep her nose out! The audacity of your sil to post a picture of you in your wedding dress! Lucky she hasn\u2019t been uninvited!", "NTA what kind of absolute MORON posts a picture of the bride trying on her wedding dress like c'mon now", "NTA\n\nNot sharing someone elses wedding dress is not some super obscure rule that no one knows.  EVERYONE knows that you don't share pictures of the wedding dress before the wedding.  Clueless or malicious exploding on her is completely valid and she deserved to have her feelings hurt.", "NTA\n\nI suspect your SIL is jealous and wants to subtly sabotage your wedding -- at least the envelopes and the hair consultation were passive-aggressive.\n\nBut posting the photo of you crying while wearing your chosen wedding dress is beyond subtle. This was a real AH stunt. The fact that she hasn't apologized tells me she definitely wants to mess up your wedding. \n\nGood for you for booting her out of the bridal party. \n\nYou might want to ask one of the bridesmaids to keep an eye on SIL at the wedding, and be prepared with a glass of red wine. I wouldn't put it past SIL to wear a lacy white dress.\n\n* Have a wonderful wedding!", "Is your brother by chance the golden child? Because wtaf is your mother thinking? NTA\n\nDo not let that chick back in your bridal party. \n\nI hope you have a fabulous wedding!", "NTA\n\nIf you don't forgive her that is entirely within your right. Not only did she post your wedding dressing for everyone including your fianc\u00e9 to see, but she discarded your emotions and shared a very emotional, private moment with everyone that followed her. It might be sufficient to not have her in your wedding party, but still invited to the wedding to avoid further drama, unless you think that it will significantly take away from your day. Either way if I were you I would not allow her into my wedding party LOL", "NTA.  Your mother is concerned about you hurting your SIL's feeling, yet sees nothing wrong with your SIL hurting your feelings? SIL can attend as a guest.\n\n Make sure you have passwords on all your vendors and someone at the wedding and reception to give the boot to anyone causing trouble. You may need both.", "NTA and I think you should pull your brother in at this point. Your SIL sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't have your permission in the first place and I would tell her to take it down immediately or she can be uninvited from the wedding all together.\n\nShe crossed so many red flag boundaries and your MIL is just as bad for defending her. She (for those who believe in the not letting the groom see the bride in the dress before the wedding day thing) risked your wedding.\n\nYou don't always have the chance to find \"THE dress\" twice.\n\nShe's lucky, I would have told her she is on a strict info diet and not welcome to any information regarding the wedding until the day of.", "NTA. Your SIL is trying to sabotage your wedding\u2014you should uninvite her entirely unless she apologizes", "NTA part of being a grown up is remembering you don\u2019t owe people forgiveness, especially if they are unrepentant.  Your SIL is a hater and is trying to get her moments of attention in nasty, selfish ways.  Shame on your mom for supporting this toddler just to keep the peace.  Show her this thread, your SIL is the enemy.  \n\nAnd OP, revenge dieting works.  You hold off on calories and work your ass off literally and when you walk down the aisle you will be proud.  As you pass her, since she\u2019s sitting in the guest seats, just give her the eyes and smirk.  Envision this moment every time you feel hungry, because nothing tastes as good as sweet sweet revenge.", "NTA\n\nThis is seems like blatant sabotage or at least trying to knock you down some pegs. \n\nYou should forgive her because she's an extension of your family. That said, it's you and your fiance's wedding. If you don't want her in the bridal party, that is totally your decision and everyone else can pound sand.", "NTA, in what world could she have thought it was a good idea to post a photo of the bride, and crying at that! Does she live under a rock? Is she that desperate for \"likes\"? I'm so sorry this has happened to you. You do not need to let her back in. If you saw her in your wedding party on your wedding day it would just bring back all these memories. It's Not something you want to deal with on your special day. Big hugs.", "NTA. Fuck her feelings. I would have booted her when she \"forgot\" to put the invitations in the envelope. No way in hell that was accidental. And, not only did she spoil the surprise for your husband to be by posting a picture of you in the dress, she did it to humiliate you. Tell your mom to back the fuck off and stop pushing.", "NTA and your mom needs to either support you or butt TF out.", "Maybe she doesn\u2019t have any friends because she is a nightmare.\n\nNta", "I\u2019m with you! -PLUS- I\u2019m pissed off for you!! WTF is wrong with your mom and SIL? You are definitely NOT THE ASS!", "NTA\u2026 your SIL is just plain mean and dum* and your mother is super annoying.. this is setiously not ok!!!", "NTA what does your fianc\u00e9 say??", "NTA and your SIL is a self centered witch. She doesn\u2019t deserve your empathy or an invitation to your wedding. Maybe in 6 months you\u2019ll feel differently but for now your mom needs to take your side and realize how horrible she was to you.", "NTA , your SIL did all that intentionally, how tf you forget to put the invites in the envelope ?!!", "This is why SIL has no connection to the family.

I'm not sure why you should forgive her.\n\nThat was a hurtful and mean thing to do to you.  Your sister-in-law is a bully and I wouldn't want her at your wedding.", "NTA and honestly I would think about even having her at the wedding. There is no excuse for posting the picture other than to intentionally hurt you. That is just evil.", "I wouldn't just kick her out, I'd ban her from the wedding. She did that on purpose.", "NTA.  That was a pretty horrible thing for her to do to you.  Not just showing your wedding dress to everyone (which is a weird but ultimately a well known wedding taboo), but also the picture showed you \"ugly crying\" presumably because of the weight issue (a very vulnerable and upsetting time for you).  You are well within your rights to exclude her for doing something so horrible.
