It may be different if OP can't afford therapy and the book is specifically about whatever mental health issue she's dealing with - I can see that being potentially helpful. Most self help books aren't like this though and are just generic in the advice they sell, they're also usually not written by professionals in the mental health field. Therapy is all about finding a professional who has the tools to listen to your issues and create a customised plan of action and responses going forward. Even then, some people may not be able to get better without medication or more intensive forms of therapy. A self help book can't offer this same level of care, help and flexibility.", "PMDD isn't a mental illness, it's typically considered an endocrine disorder, but can still be managed with the typical treatments for depression/anxiety. There's even debate if PMDD is an actual thing or it really is just a different form of depression/anxiety. I called it a mental health issues because OP isn't sure if it's PMDD (just she thinks she can track it to her cycles), plus (at least where I am) there's a difference between mental health issues and a mental illness. Mental health issues can include experiencing depression without actually having depression.", "I think the core problem is the lack of communication before the gift in the first place. It would be much less offensive for him to say \"hey, I care a lot about you, and I've noticed you struggling lately. I'm worried, and I'd like to try and help somehow if I can.\"\n\nThe problem with the self-help book as a gift is it bypassed that entire acknowledgement of OP's struggles. We don't have context from the OP about whether her boyfriend knows if she's linked her depressive episodes to her PMDD, only that the gift came \"out of the blue\". He didn't talk to her about her mental health challenges recently, didn't offer support, *didn't give her a chance to tell him what she actually needs*. Therefore, *even if this wasn't his intention*, the subtext of getting the book would read as \"you have problems, here, go figure them out.\" Maybe it's an attempt at care, but without him actually offering any legitimate support beyond the self-help book (which, as other folks have pointed out, is potentially not even relevant), it reads a lot more as an acknowledgement of how her struggles are inconveniencing him. Which... Yeah, I'd be offended too.\n\nI think it really boils down to intent vs impact. I hear your argument - with the info we have, it seems like the boyfriend was *trying* to do the right thing. But he approached it in a really shitty way.
