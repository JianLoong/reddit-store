Did he give this to you in a serious manner? If you genuinely reflect on your behavior recently is it at all understandable that he would think you are depressed?", "Context is key. Did he SAY anything when he gave it to you?  While his efforts seem to be very caring, I could understand being caught off guard if he just handed it to you without saying something like \u201cplease know how much I care about you and I am here for you if you are struggling\u201d.  If his intentions were good, I can see that your smiling then laughing could come across as hurtful. However, from your lens, I can see  smiling and laugh as a reaction to feeling uncomfortable in the situation, not that you are making fun of him.  Talk to him and explain the situation and ask for a redo. Explain that you appreciate him being concerned and that your struggles are related to hormonal swings. Tell him that him thinking of you was tremendously sweet and caring and that you appreciate him. I think this was a situation between 2 people who care about one another that just flopped. You both can recover from it!  I wish you all the best.", "**ESH**, him for giving you a gift you found offensive, and you for laughing at a gift he clearly chose with you and your circumstances in mind in an attempt to be thoughtful.\n\nYou say you \u201cfeel there\u2019s better ways\u201d to do this, but he tries his best and you shat on it because the way he was showing that he cared wasn\u2019t good enough for you. You both kind of suck, but to me you come across worse than him.", "Nta, i font know why you find it funny but a self help book is a shit gift that could easily be considered offensive.", "NTA he's lucky that you laughed I think I would've just been insulted", "Def NTA, also look into /r/PMDD it sounds like it lines up with your 'pms depression'", "Maybe she wanted the Peloton?", "Yeah it feels like he does, I recently found out that he still calls his ex words like dear,darling and sometimes sweet nicknames. So understandable this made me uncomfortable so I don\u2019t feel as affectionate towards him. But he then accuses me of just turning affection on and off like a tap, when I\u2019m genuinely annoyed.", "I love this!", "It was a commercial. Not enough back story to confirm she wanted one.\n\nEdit: getting replies and downvotes from people of didn't like the commercial and from those who thought the dislike was silly.", "Why am I being down voted so much?  I ended up getting a Peloton for my wife because she really wanted one, even though I thought it was expensive and didn't love the idea.  She was thrilled to get it.  Fast forward 3 years later and I'm the only one using it. Lol.  Am I an asshole for getting my wife something she said she wanted?", "Oh cool, so when something bothers you he turns it around and makes you the problem instead of acknowledging any issue about his own behavior. That is not a good trait in a partner. Might want to reconsider the relationship", "This dude sounds like a dud.", "That commercial was widely criticized. The message was basically you\u2019re fat and need to exercise.", "Right.  So why assume the worst?  It seems like the assumption is it was forced upon her by her controlling husband whenever it\u2019s brought up.", "Yeah I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s a pattern of behaviour he has\u2026", "I loved Ryan Reynolds followup ad a few days later, where she's just sipping gin at a bar with her friends with a look of relief on her face.", "Was that the message though?", "Everyone goofs once or twice, but yeah, sounds like that's just how he is. You can't fix that, because to him that's not a problem. You deserve better. Being alone sounds better tbh", "Dude he's calling his ex pet names?\nWhy are you still with this dude?\nYou deserve better. Stop being this guy's side piece disguised as a gf. Wake up and break up!"]}
