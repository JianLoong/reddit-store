Did he give this to you in a serious manner? If you genuinely reflect on your behavior recently is it at all understandable that he would think you are depressed?", "Context is key. Did he SAY anything when he gave it to you?  While his efforts seem to be very caring, I could understand being caught off guard if he just handed it to you without saying something like \u201cplease know how much I care about you and I am here for you if you are struggling\u201d.  If his intentions were good, I can see that your smiling then laughing could come across as hurtful. However, from your lens, I can see  smiling and laugh as a reaction to feeling uncomfortable in the situation, not that you are making fun of him.  Talk to him and explain the situation and ask for a redo. Explain that you appreciate him being concerned and that your struggles are related to hormonal swings. Tell him that him thinking of you was tremendously sweet and caring and that you appreciate him. I think this was a situation between 2 people who care about one another that just flopped. You both can recover from it!  I wish you all the best.", "**ESH**, him for giving you a gift you found offensive, and you for laughing at a gift he clearly chose with you and your circumstances in mind in an attempt to be thoughtful.\n\nYou say you \u201cfeel there\u2019s better ways\u201d to do this, but he tries his best and you shat on it because the way he was showing that he cared wasn\u2019t good enough for you. You both kind of suck, but to me you come across worse than him.", "Nta, i font know why you find it funny but a self help book is a shit gift that could easily be considered offensive.", "NTA he's lucky that you laughed I think I would've just been insulted", "Def NTA, also look into /r/PMDD it sounds like it lines up with your 'pms depression'", "Maybe she wanted the Peloton?", "Yeah it feels like he does, I recently found out that he still calls his ex words like dear,darling and sometimes sweet nicknames. So understandable this made me uncomfortable so I don\u2019t feel as affectionate towards him. But he then accuses me of just turning affection on and off like a tap, when I\u2019m genuinely annoyed.", "I love this!", "It was a commercial. Not enough back story to confirm she wanted one.\n\nEdit: getting replies and downvotes from people of didn't like the commercial and from those who thought the dislike was silly.", "Why am I being down voted so much?  I ended up getting a Peloton for my wife because she really wanted one, even though I thought it was expensive and didn't love the idea.  She was thrilled to get it.  Fast forward 3 years later and I'm the only one using it. Lol.  Am I an asshole for getting my wife something she said she wanted?", "Oh cool, so when something bothers you he turns it around and makes you the problem instead of acknowledging any issue about his own behavior. That is not a good trait in a partner. Might want to reconsider the relationship", "This dude sounds like a dud.", "That commercial was widely criticized. The message was basically you\u2019re fat and need to exercise.", "Right.  So why assume the worst?  It seems like the assumption is it was forced upon her by her controlling husband whenever it\u2019s brought up.", "Yeah I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s a pattern of behaviour he has\u2026", "I loved Ryan Reynolds followup ad a few days later, where she's just sipping gin at a bar with her friends with a look of relief on her face.", "Was that the message though?", "Everyone goofs once or twice, but yeah, sounds like that's just how he is. You can't fix that, because to him that's not a problem. You deserve better. Being alone sounds better tbh", "Dude he's calling his ex pet names?\nWhy are you still with this dude?\nYou deserve better. Stop being this guy's side piece disguised as a gf. Wake up and break up!", "NTA, when did you guys start dating? Because the 8 year age difference can seem super weird if you guys had been dating for a while. I bet your bf thinks depression can be solved by \"just being happy\" and \"stop thinking about sad things\" \ud83d\ude44", "NTA.... And that's called PMDD....Pre-menstrual Dysphoric disorder.... and it's pretty common", "NAH. Ya'll need to talk this out because it seems you're both thinking stuff without saying it.", "nta he ain't it honey", "NTA\n\nI mean there's really two options here: you can laugh and find it funny or you can be offended and be mad at your partner", "i think NAH. the gift was super inconsiderate-- it reminds me of giving someone mouthwash or deodorant. even if you think someone needs those things (or a self-help book), there are other ways to go about it.\n\nthat said, he probably cares about you and genuinely thinks this could be useful to you. his timing was terrible, especially if you haven't talked about it really recently and you haven't expressed wanting to look into something like that, but there's obviously no malice behind it.", "INFO: What book?", "NTA- he showed and told you how he consider you. And that doesn\u2019t seems to match how you feel about yourself, nor how others reflected about you previously. \n\nAdding the age difference between you, and pretty sure he see you as an inferior little thing that he will mentor in a way, to not said control. \n\nHis gift might come from good intentions -as the path to hells btw. However he also showed how badly he can\u2019t handle things not going his way. \n\nMood swings linked to cycle is a reality for many. Nothing really surprising as hormones play a part in how we feel, and cycle can make the variations quite tough. Have you been checked for PCOS?", "Is he still also sending his ex money?!!", "My husband bought me a thigh master for my birthday early in our marriage.", "Oooff, that sounds like emotional affair territory.", "Dude you are not even the topic here, neither is your wife. OP clearly didnt want that book and never mentioned it. Your wife did mention it and wanted it. Thats the difference. And your \"maybe she wanted it\" is just overanalyzing everything", "Op really think of what life would be like without him. What would your day to day be? Would it better without the hardship of his attitudes and having to do these mental gymnastics of who is wrong and right? \n\nI\u2019m not jumping to break up, but take some time to think of life without your bf.", "Wasn't commenting about OP's post.  Was commenting about Richard\\_D\\_Lawson's comment.  Is that not allowed?", "Yes. And i replied to your comment whining about downvotes. Which you made in regards to that Person while applying your Situation to OPs", "No.  Wasn't applying my situation to OP's.  Was applying in regards to the Peloton commercial.  I thought that was pretty clear?\n\nAlso, didn't know asking a question automatically equated to whining.  I'm genuinely curious.", "He asks, while continuing to whine.", "Why is he offended?\n\nHe gave you a self help book for depression. \n\nYou laughed your ass off and hopefully got in a good mood. \n\nConclusion: this is the best self help book ever with the fastest results - even if they are very shortterm. \n\nNTA", "NTA - gifting someone a self help book is like gifting them a set of mouthwash/deodorant. It's not really a gift, more like a backhanded comment disguised as a gift. If I were you, I'd be seriously reconsidering the relationship.", "Break up with him and give him the book back. \n\nSay, \u201cthanks! It worked\u201d", "So he gifts you a book instead of, you know, TALKING to you about it? If he had, you would have explained, but he jumped to conclusions. \n\nAnd yah, i often have a day where i feel vulnerable/moody too. My husband usually asks if im ok, ill tell him im just hormonal and whether he should leave me alone or give me a hug. Then ill watch a chickflick, bawl my eyes out and feel a bit better ^_^\n\nSo NTA, your bf needs to learn how to communicate", "NTA... you fiund it funny. I'm not a depressed person so when once a month the world seems to be falling apart I recognize the hormonal changes  it honestly amazes me that chemicals in our body can cause our perspective on life to change. I feel for those that dont have their hormones regulated.", "NTA.  This is a huge red flag.  He's basically telling you, you are not good enough.  This is not a gift.  This is a manual for how you can do better for him.", "NTA", "He's lucky your PMS cycle isn't like mine, because I get unreasonably angry for a couple days each month. I've learned to apologize in advance for being cranky, and the people in my house know not to push me by, say, offering unsolicited advice/self-help books. NTA.", "To be fair, I'd probably poo myself with laughter, with PMS, if I know the time of the month is coming, I found out a very long time ago, exercise and sports means I don't feel much pain or have issues with my mood at all. Try it. He shouldn't be annoyed as that present can be taken as an insult NTA", "*checks OP's age* *Checks BF age* nice to see Reddit confirming the ol' 7 year rule of dating. \n\nNTA this is a laughably terrible gift.", "NTA. Self-help books as gifts always strike my funny bone because when my brother was like 7 my older cousin gave him a self-help book as a birthday present, the cherry on top being that some of the words were underlined", "NTA. You're both sensitive people. I'm not criticizing, just assessing based on what you've shared. Certainly nothing wrong with that. All in all, being that you're both the same in that regard - you guys seem like a great match. Both of you have a right to be slightly offended. Surely you can understand him being a little offended, and hopefully he can see your side too. Did you communicate your side to him?\n\nFurthermore, consider reading the book. It may help. It wouldn't hurt letting him see you reading the book sometimes too.", "I mean, it wasn't a 'gift,' he was trying to tell you something, and trying to help you.  You might want to spend a few minutes seriously self-reflecting on this.\n\n> I feel there\u2019s better ways to go about getting someone help than just coming up to them randomly and giving them a self help book.\n\nFirst of all, it wasn't random.  Second, maybe he's tried to communicate with you, and you just dismiss him.\n\nTry listening to what he might be saying, rather than what you're hearing.", "NTA.  If it was a book about a topic you in which you had previously expressed interest, it might have been OK.  \n\nThis seems like he\u2019s saying \u201cYou are defective. Use this to fix yourself\u201d.", "Nearly a decade older than you, clearly still has a thing for his ex (nicknames? \u2018Darling\u2019?? You\u2019re fucking kidding bro that\u2019s not a \u2018nickname\u2019 that\u2019s \u2018I still love you.\u2019 Let me guess, he\u2019s the one that got dumped?) and gives you gifts that you don\u2019t want/aren\u2019t helpful. Why are you dating him again??", "I was on antidepressants, and it would still come back every cycle. NTA", "Yep I was going to mention this too! Going on birth control helped me immensely, but I know that's not a good option for everyone.", "Surely you can understand him being a little offended, and hopefully he can see your side too.", "I love this response so much, had me lol \ud83d\ude02you made my day!", "That sounds awful I\u2019m sorry you have to go through that! Yeah doesn\u2019t feel reasonable that he gets annoyed at me being annoyed this not being as affectionate towards him.", "I\u2019ve experienced the exact same. I had the Mirena coil fitted and it helped loooads. I still have some crankiness and my patience/fuse is shorter than it normally would be but in comparison to before, the difference it makes is awesome.", "Does he like to READ?", "Read her comments, bf is definitely an AH", "Um, \"tries his best\" by trying to change her?  No.", "PS There is a book titled \u201cThe Art and Etiquette of Gift Giving\u201d.  Perhaps you should buy it for him ?", "....why are you with him?", "Wow, that's pretty hard to top. He must like to sleep on the sofa.", "Planning enjoyable/pleasurable activities ahead of time (for the week you\u2019re going to be depressed) can also help! A lot of my clients have PMDD and I\u2019ll get them to schedule days out at the beach or a trip to the trampoline park during the depressed time. It really helps in regulating their mood and stops them from socially withdrawing.", "Thanks! It's better now that I'm An Old Person, but it does definitely impact life. Still, it's part of being an adult to learn to deal with the hormones, etc.", "I'm glad that works for them! I would have just canceled plans or been absolutely miserable if I did go through with them, because my depression was pretty severe (lots of suicidal ideation going on).", "Pay attention to those patterns.  Sit and do some solid reflecting.  Read some articles about gaslighting.", "NTA. If it was a book about a topic you in which you had previously expressed interest, it might have been OK.", "Oof SI adds a whole other layer of difficulty. I\u2019m really glad the birth control helped you bc that\u2019s a nightmare to go through each month. \n\nI will say that the enjoyable activities thing didn\u2019t work for *any* of them the first time. Or even the second, or third. It takes a while if consistent practice to notice a difference. But for anyone who can\u2019t take birth control, it\u2019s a decent \u201cbackup option\u201d for sure (plus I love assigning \u201cgo to the trampoline park\u201d as therapy homework - way more fun than automatic thought records \ud83d\ude05)", "LOL"]}
