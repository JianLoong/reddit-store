{"id": 13587, "submission_id": "126y3mb", "title": "AITA For Trying To Get My Wife To Let My Daughter Call Her Mom?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account   \n\n\nI (36m) have a daughter \"Claire\" (13f) but I didn't know about her until I was contacted by social services when she was 9 years old when her mom got into some trouble and was sent away. Her mom was an ex-girlfriend I broke up with after I found out she stole my sister's identity to take and max out cards in my sister's name. Due to this I didn't believe her when she said that I was Claire's father but the paternity tests proved otherwise. \n\nThe problem was that I was already married to my wife \"Lisa\" (37f) and we were already expecting twins at the time I found out about Claire. Lisa was not happy about the news, as she already felt as if the twins would be a hand full. After the DNA tests proved that I was the dad Lisa was strongly considering divorce since she didn't sign up to be a stepmom but I begged for couple's therapy. I also got a lot of friends to talk to Lisa on my behalf and I don't think she ever got over how they made her feel like a monster for not readily accepting Claire. \n\nUltimately Lisa agreed to counseling and agreed that, given Claire's situation, I was the best option for her but made it very clear that she was not going to be a mom to Claire. That all of Claire's expenses like clothing, special snacks, extracurricular activities, college, etc. would be my sole responsibility, that her side of the family would have no obligation to treat her equally to the twins, and that I needed to make arrangements incase I died before Claire was 18. I agreed to these terms because I was desperate to keep my wife and I didn't want to miss out on anything with the twins. \n\nIt was rough at first but I believed we've worked out a system that works for us. Lisa has no problem with taking Claire to school or special events, helps her with her homework, cooks her food, and gives her guidance about feminine related things. Recently, Claire has gotten into the habit of wanting to call Lisa \"mom\" and Lisa has spoken to me privately about getting Claire to stop. I asked Lisa if she would be willing to open her heart to Claire and just let her have this since her real mom won't be released until Claire is in her 20s. Lisa was firm reminding me of our agreement and that if I didn't correct Claire's behavior soon she would because while she has grown to care about Claire she never wants to give off the impression that she sees her as equal to the twins.

There is nothing wrong with Lisa just being a good friend to Claire.  Lisa has already made major concessions in this situation - respect her wishes.", "This is tricky, but I'm going YTA. Granted, you didn't know about Clair until a few years ago, but relationships are a two-way street. She doesn't want to be mum to your daughter, and that needs to be respected. It seems she has taken on a kind of role model type of relationship for your daughter, and at least she cares about her to that extent. You need to remember she was essentially bullied into staying because, as you said, all of your friends made her feel like a monster for something I'm sure a lot of people would struggle with. Let your wife have the peace she's found regarding her new reality because she may just grow to resent you (and possibly by extension your daughter) if you keep unfairly pushing her.", "YTA.

Just stop it.", "I think ESH (adults). It would be one thing if your wife just didn't want to be called mom, but when you throw everything else in there she really does come off as a monster. I can understand the emotions when this first came out, but it has been years. This is a child and she's ready to throw her out the minute you die. Unbelievable.\n\nAnd you need to stick up for your daughter. You have accepted her into your life, do it's time to act like a father and protect her. The agreement you and your wife came to to remain married is untenable and guarantees your daughter will always be treated like an orphan in a Dickensian novel. If that was what it took for your wife remain family, you should have rejected it because you're not actually acting like a family.", "Soft YTA. Look she was VERY clear about her boundaries. You and your friends brow beat her into accepting a role that she was not happy with and, despite her very strong reluctance, she has held up her side of the agreement and is participating in your daughter\u2019s life.

She has known her since she was nine years old. Of course the kid is going to want to call her mom. I think it\u2019s only natural.\n\nEither way, this seems like a very toxic environment for the child to grow up in and I can only imagine the issues she\u2019s going to have later. Not to mention your marriage doesn\u2019t sound that great either.\n\nYou should never have taken the child in if you weren\u2019t willing to treat her equally to your other children. That\u2019s the long and short of it.

The fact that your wife wants to make it known she feels Claire is not equal to the twins is gross. Also - I\u2019m confused.

Or was the first you ever heard of your daughter when she was 9?", "There isn't a child in the world that I would treat the way your wife is treating Claire. And yes, I speak from experience.  \n\nJust cut to the chase and rename her Cinderella. \n\nEvery child deserves to be loved and treated equally. Claire did not do anything wrong. She is just as important as the twins. Thanks to your wife, the twins will grow up treating her just as abysmally. \n\nShe doesn't want to be called mom? Fine, but she should act like a mom anyway, or she doesn't deserve the title.", "You\u2019re both the AH. It isn\u2019t fair for you to push a relationship such as this on her when she has made it very clear where she stands, but she also doesn\u2019t need to be so cruel about this whole thing and refer to Claire as a lesser child compared to her own.", "YTA for staying with this woman and letting your daughter be treated this way in her own house, she's going to grow up with so many issues, do you have your daughter and family in therapy at all cause you all majorly need it.", "ESH.

You could just say \u201cshe doesn\u2019t like that because she doesn\u2019t want to hurt your mom\u2019s feelings.\u201d The thing that makes her an AH is her insistence that Claire never being given the impression that she is equal to the twins. No girl should have to live with people who intentionally treat her as inferior. Hopefully that will change with time, but if not you would be the AH for making your daughter grow up in that environment.

That\u2019s not fair and frankly further traumatizes an already traumatized child.

Claire thinking their relationship is better than it is like this is only going to hurt her more. Your wife was clear with you FROM THE BEGINNING what her stance was and you should have taken that for the blazing red flag that it was.\n\nBut your wife is frankly pretty callous here and I can\u2019t imagine deliberately treating a child the way she is treating Claire. I would not want to be friends with someone with her attitude, much less married and raising children with them. Like, she\u2019s doing more than she agreed to, but she demanded the unfair arrangement while still only pregnant with twins and doesn\u2019t seem to care about how Claire has grown to care about her. At least she was honest about this, though. \n\nYou\u2019re probably the biggest AH for not handling this better in the beginning, being cowardly in concessions, and getting others to pressure Lisa. You\u2019ve been incredibly selfish here, not really considering the best scenario of well-being for your daughter or wife. They both are in a situation not good for them because you wanted your cake and to eat it too. You cannot both be a good parent to Claire and maintain the dynamic you agreed to with your wife. The difference between them is that Claire is a CHILD thrown into this situation and your wife is making choices. \n\nYou either need to divorce or to get everyone involved in therapy ASAP. Probably the former.", "YTA from the beginning she was clear she was not capable of being a step mom.

After the DNA tests proved that I was the dad Lisa was strongly considering divorce since she didn't sign up to be a stepmom but I begged for couple's therapy. I also got a lot of friends to talk to Lisa on my behalf and I don't think she ever got over how they made her feel like a monster for not readily accepting Claire. \n\nUltimately Lisa agreed to counseling and agreed that, given Claire's situation, I was the best option for her but made it very clear that she was not going to be a mom to Claire. That all of Claire's expenses like clothing, special snacks, extracurricular activities, college, etc. would be my sole responsibility, that her side of the family would have no obligation to treat her equally to the twins, and that I needed to make arrangements incase I died before Claire was 18. I agreed to these terms because I was desperate to keep my wife and I didn't want to miss out on anything with the twins. \n\nIt was rough at first but I believed we've worked out a system that works for us. Lisa has no problem with taking Claire to school or special events, helps her with her homework, cooks her food, and gives her guidance about feminine related things. Recently, Claire has gotten into the habit of wanting to call Lisa \"mom\" and Lisa has spoken to me privately about getting Claire to stop. I asked Lisa if she would be willing to open her heart to Claire and just let her have this since her real mom won't be released until Claire is in her 20s. Lisa was firm reminding me of our agreement and that if I didn't correct Claire's behavior soon she would because while she has grown to care about Claire she never wants to give off the impression that she sees her as equal to the twins.

So I really dgaff if she clothes her, and feeds her and brushes her hair, it means f all if she goes out of her way to make her feel like she is an outsider in her home, and what do think is gonna happen when the twins get to an age where they understand what is happening and decide that they are also going to treat her like she is less than them? This child did not ask to be born into these circumstances and the adults in her life should have got their shit together and did what was best for all the children involved in this shit show, instead of doing what was best for themselves. ESH.", "Right. Obviously the kids like her enough to want to call her mom voluntarily.", "Nope I\u2019m happily married with kids. And I feel bad for the position she was put in. But Reddit has turned a post where the guy tried to stay married to his pregnant wife and did couples counseling into \u201cbullying and abuse\u201d. Which is crazy.\n\nShe may not have any more power than him. I could be totally wrong. But her ability to make the step daughter 2nd class for 4 years in my opinion implies otherwise.", "I love that you have turned \u201ctried to keep our family together and went to counseling\u201d into some disturbing abusive thing done to his wife. \n\nFrom all appearances the wife is the more dominant figure and this dude is just doing his best.", "yes and? this is 9 years after the girl was born.", "I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong, but that doesn\u2019t make her right. We owe no one anything on this world, but empathy and compassion are virtues. The child shouldn\u2019t be treated like a second class citizen in her own home, and should feel just as loved as her siblings. Sure the mom is technically \u201cright\u201d becuase it\u2019s not her kid, but she\u2019s still an asshole. No one said you can\u2019t be right *and* still be a dick.", "> She never wants to give of the impression that she sees her as equal to the twins. \n\n> Her side of the family would have no obligation to treat to treat her equally. \n\nOf course you can say she\u2019s just not her mother. But look at the cards the kid has been dealt and have a little compassion. You\u2019re telling me that when you were a kid you would understand why the only motherly figure you\u2019ve ever known treats you differently than you siblings?\n\nYou can argue that the mom is technically right, but she\u2019s still an asshole.", "I mean he says she cares for her stepdaughter but mom is a hard line for her. I don't think that's unreasonable, especially as she has a living mother.", "Read the original post, counselling was only suggested after the husband got his friends involved to guilt her to stay, he even states he doesn't believe she ever fully got over the guilting done by his friends to her.\n\nIf OP had not have gotten outsiders involved to muddy the water and went straight with counselling, this probably would not have happened because the wife would have had clarity to chose to stay or leave from a professional, not a bunch of outsiders who are not personally effected by the situation.", "OP\u2019s wife is literally doing everything a stepparent should and again what the entire world says is the limit. It\u2019s completely unfair to say that children can create an emotional boundary and adults cannot. If she\u2019s doesn\u2019t see her as her child she just doesn\u2019t. Just because she\u2019s a child doesn\u2019t mean that the double standard is ok. Lisa is not mistreating Claire. She\u2019s not her mother. I do think Lisa should talk to Claire and tell that she cares for her but that she has a mom and wouldn\u2019t want to take her place. But if she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable doing that and wants OP to, she\u2019s not wrong. She\u2019s not mistreating her. How many stories of kids saying that they exclude their step siblings from activities with their bio family because that\u2019s THEIR family? I swear I see at least two a week. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this. It may seem mean but Lisa doesn\u2019t seem to actually be mistreating her at all."]}
