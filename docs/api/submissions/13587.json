Her mom was an ex-girlfriend I broke up with after I found out she stole my sister's identity to take and max out cards in my sister's name. Due to this I didn't believe her when she said that I was Claire's father but the paternity tests proved otherwise. \n\nThe problem was that I was already married to my wife \"Lisa\" (37f) and we were already expecting twins at the time I found out about Claire. Lisa was not happy about the news, as she already felt as if the twins would be a hand full. After the DNA tests proved that I was the dad Lisa was strongly considering divorce since she didn't sign up to be a stepmom but I begged for couple's therapy. I also got a lot of friends to talk to Lisa on my behalf and I don't think she ever got over how they made her feel like a monster for not readily accepting Claire. \n\nUltimately Lisa agreed to counseling and agreed that, given Claire's situation, I was the best option for her but made it very clear that she was not going to be a mom to Claire. That all of Claire's expenses like clothing, special snacks, extracurricular activities, college, etc. would be my sole responsibility, that her side of the family would have no obligation to treat her equally to the twins, and that I needed to make arrangements incase I died before Claire was 18. I agreed to these terms because I was desperate to keep my wife and I didn't want to miss out on anything with the twins. \n\nIt was rough at first but I believed we've worked out a system that works for us. Lisa has no problem with taking Claire to school or special events, helps her with her homework, cooks her food, and gives her guidance about feminine related things. Recently, Claire has gotten into the habit of wanting to call Lisa \"mom\" and Lisa has spoken to me privately about getting Claire to stop. I asked Lisa if she would be willing to open her heart to Claire and just let her have this since her real mom won't be released until Claire is in her 20s. Lisa was firm reminding me of our agreement and that if I didn't correct Claire's behavior soon she would because while she has grown to care about Claire she never wants to give off the impression that she sees her as equal to the twins.

There is nothing wrong with Lisa just being a good friend to Claire.  Lisa has already made major concessions in this situation - respect her wishes.", "This is tricky, but I'm going YTA. Granted, you didn't know about Clair until a few years ago, but relationships are a two-way street. She doesn't want to be mum to your daughter, and that needs to be respected. It seems she has taken on a kind of role model type of relationship for your daughter, and at least she cares about her to that extent. You need to remember she was essentially bullied into staying because, as you said, all of your friends made her feel like a monster for something I'm sure a lot of people would struggle with. Let your wife have the peace she's found regarding her new reality because she may just grow to resent you (and possibly by extension your daughter) if you keep unfairly pushing her.", "YTA.

Just stop it.", "I think ESH (adults). It would be one thing if your wife just didn't want to be called mom, but when you throw everything else in there she really does come off as a monster. I can understand the emotions when this first came out, but it has been years. This is a child and she's ready to throw her out the minute you die. Unbelievable.\n\nAnd you need to stick up for your daughter. You have accepted her into your life, do it's time to act like a father and protect her. The agreement you and your wife came to to remain married is untenable and guarantees your daughter will always be treated like an orphan in a Dickensian novel. If that was what it took for your wife remain family, you should have rejected it because you're not actually acting like a family.", "Soft YTA. Look she was VERY clear about her boundaries. You and your friends brow beat her into accepting a role that she was not happy with and, despite her very strong reluctance, she has held up her side of the agreement and is participating in your daughter\u2019s life. Just because you are unhappy with the situation does not mean she isn\u2019t allowed her feelings. Nothing here has changed for her. Don\u2019t make this worse for her.", "Everybody is the asshole in this situation.\n\nYou\u2019re the asshole for forcing your wife to take in a child who you didn\u2019t know and bullying her using your friends.\n\nYour wife is the asshole for blaming a child who doesn\u2019t know better for her situation. She has known her since she was nine years old. Of course the kid is going to want to call her mom. I think it\u2019s only natural.\n\nEither way, this seems like a very toxic environment for the child to grow up in and I can only imagine the issues she\u2019s going to have later. Not to mention your marriage doesn\u2019t sound that great either.\n\nYou should never have taken the child in if you weren\u2019t willing to treat her equally to your other children. That\u2019s the long and short of it. If you aren\u2019t willing to provide a loving home, we\u2019re both parents treat the child well, equally to the other children, you shouldn\u2019t have bothered. This is not right.", "ESH. The fact that your wife wants to make it known she feels Claire is not equal to the twins is gross. Also - I\u2019m confused. Did she initially tell you she was pregnant and you didn\u2019t believe her? Or was the first you ever heard of your daughter when she was 9?", "There isn't a child in the world that I would treat the way your wife is treating Claire. And yes, I speak from experience.  \n\nJust cut to the chase and rename her Cinderella. \n\nEvery child deserves to be loved and treated equally. Claire did not do anything wrong. She is just as important as the twins. Thanks to your wife, the twins will grow up treating her just as abysmally. \n\nShe doesn't want to be called mom? Fine, but she should act like a mom anyway, or she doesn't deserve the title.", "You\u2019re both the AH. It isn\u2019t fair for you to push a relationship such as this on her when she has made it very clear where she stands, but she also doesn\u2019t need to be so cruel about this whole thing and refer to Claire as a lesser child compared to her own.", "YTA for staying with this woman and letting your daughter be treated this way in her own house, she's going to grow up with so many issues, do you have your daughter and family in therapy at all cause you all majorly need it.", "ESH.

You could just say \u201cshe doesn\u2019t like that because she doesn\u2019t want to hurt your mom\u2019s feelings.\u201d The thing that makes her an AH is her insistence that Claire never being given the impression that she is equal to the twins. No girl should have to live with people who intentionally treat her as inferior. Hopefully that will change with time, but if not you would be the AH for making your daughter grow up in that environment. YTA for agreeing with it to begin with, but luckily Lisa is acting like a parent and the twins aren\u2019t born yet so it hasn\u2019t been a huge problem yet.", "You got your friends to bully and guilt your wife into staying in a marriage she wanted to leave. She laid out conditions that weren't charitable towards your daughter that you've assumed care for. You expect all that to change because your wife, after laying clear expectations, has treated your daughter like a human being. Jfc. \n\nIt's okay for your wife to have boundaries. She didn't sign up for this child, not really, she was shamed into it. She can clearly explain to your daughter that she is not her mother. The whole fucking family needs therapy.

She told you so. \nYou had people bully her in to submission. \nBe a parent to your child remove her from the situation and let your wife live the life she wants.

That\u2019s not fair and frankly further traumatizes an already traumatized child. It\u2019s not a healthy family dynamic for anyone and is no better than divorcing would be. \n\nSecond, you shouldn\u2019t have pressured your wife so hard to a situation she did not want to be in, and then push the envelope further once she was in that situation. Claire thinking their relationship is better than it is like this is only going to hurt her more. Your wife was clear with you FROM THE BEGINNING what her stance was and you should have taken that for the blazing red flag that it was.\n\nBut your wife is frankly pretty callous here and I can\u2019t imagine deliberately treating a child the way she is treating Claire. I would not want to be friends with someone with her attitude, much less married and raising children with them. Like, she\u2019s doing more than she agreed to, but she demanded the unfair arrangement while still only pregnant with twins and doesn\u2019t seem to care about how Claire has grown to care about her. At least she was honest about this, though. \n\nYou\u2019re probably the biggest AH for not handling this better in the beginning, being cowardly in concessions, and getting others to pressure Lisa. You\u2019ve been incredibly selfish here, not really considering the best scenario of well-being for your daughter or wife. They both are in a situation not good for them because you wanted your cake and to eat it too. You cannot both be a good parent to Claire and maintain the dynamic you agreed to with your wife. The difference between them is that Claire is a CHILD thrown into this situation and your wife is making choices. \n\nYou either need to divorce or to get everyone involved in therapy ASAP. Probably the former.", "YTA from the beginning she was clear she was not capable of being a step mom.

Due to this I didn't believe her when she said that I was Claire's father but the paternity tests proved otherwise. \n\nThe problem was that I was already married to my wife \"Lisa\" (37f) and we were already expecting twins at the time I found out about Claire. Lisa was not happy about the news, as she already felt as if the twins would be a hand full. After the DNA tests proved that I was the dad Lisa was strongly considering divorce since she didn't sign up to be a stepmom but I begged for couple's therapy. I also got a lot of friends to talk to Lisa on my behalf and I don't think she ever got over how they made her feel like a monster for not readily accepting Claire. \n\nUltimately Lisa agreed to counseling and agreed that, given Claire's situation, I was the best option for her but made it very clear that she was not going to be a mom to Claire. That all of Claire's expenses like clothing, special snacks, extracurricular activities, college, etc. would be my sole responsibility, that her side of the family would have no obligation to treat her equally to the twins, and that I needed to make arrangements incase I died before Claire was 18. I agreed to these terms because I was desperate to keep my wife and I didn't want to miss out on anything with the twins. \n\nIt was rough at first but I believed we've worked out a system that works for us. Lisa has no problem with taking Claire to school or special events, helps her with her homework, cooks her food, and gives her guidance about feminine related things. Recently, Claire has gotten into the habit of wanting to call Lisa \"mom\" and Lisa has spoken to me privately about getting Claire to stop. I asked Lisa if she would be willing to open her heart to Claire and just let her have this since her real mom won't be released until Claire is in her 20s. Lisa was firm reminding me of our agreement and that if I didn't correct Claire's behavior soon she would because while she has grown to care about Claire she never wants to give off the impression that she sees her as equal to the twins.

She doesn't like your daughter or want her, she's never going to treat her as equally no matter how much you push and she's never going to act as a mom.  You knew she wanted nothing to do with this from the beginning, she wanted a divorce, you begged her to stay, now you are asking for get to be a parent. While I do feel for your daughter, how is it going to help her to encourage get to call a woman who wants nothing to do with her mom?  She's assist acting as step mom, and that's enough for a woman who didn't want to be a step parent to begin with. \n\n\nAs to you not knowing about Claire, you 100% did know about her. You were told by your ex when she was pregnant, knowing full well you'd been having sex with her and could have been the father. While she did commit crimes, you chose to ignore your potential paternity because that was the easy option and didn't even bother to do a test at the time. That is 100% on you.", "YTA. Your wife made it clear this isn't what she wanted and she was willing to leave so that you could do your duty as a father. Yet what did you do? Have your friends bully her and now expect your wife to also \"want\" to be called \"mom\"? As much as you wish this daughter was the daughter of your now wife versus whatever trash you knocked up, she isn't. Your wife doesn't have to \"see\" her as equal to your shared children because in her eyes, she's not her kid. She just has to be respectful. In no way here does it sound like your wife is mistreating the child given the child wants to call her \"mom\" - so everyone can get off that narrative - but she is allowed to feel how she feels and allowed to not want the burden of care to fall onto her. You are a total AH. You want your wife to stay and want her to be called something that makes her uncomfortable, meanwhile you take foregranted all the extra things she seems to be doing THAT SHE DOESNT HAVE TO DO AT ALL which you already know is against everything she wants to do.", "So you begged your at the time pregnant with twins wife to stay with you when she contemplated divorce, you then got your friends involved to emotionally guilt, again, a physically and emotionally vaunerable pregnant woman with twins into staying with you and I can bet your family were involved in the guilt tripping also?

Instead of expecting your wife to pick up the pieces yet again.", "Yes to AH, you begged your wife to stay when she knew she didn't want to be a mother figure to a child she got blindsided by, you got your friends to manipulate and bully her into a believing she would be a horrible a person for leaving and then agreeing to terms which would badly effect your daughter.\n\nShes the AH for not leaving when she wanted to after being manipulated by you.\n\nLet your wife leave and get shared custody of the twins", "YTA.  \nI can't believe the people saying that Lisa is the AH. She's not signed up for this, but she did a good job anyway, to the point that Claire willingly wanted to call her mom. Isn't that clear that she's doing a marvelous job to care for an unrelated kid?  \nOP is such an asshole for begging her to stay, agreeing to her conditions, yet now he's pushing and guilting her.  \nPoor Claire, yes. But Lisa is not an AH for not wanting to be called mom. You all would be so understanding that kids do not want to call their stepmom \"mom\", yet you're berating her over this? Geez.", "YTA. A big one. Talk to your daughter. It might hurt her. But it's right thing to do. What your wife doing is too good, just don't throw that away. Your wife hadn't signed up for anything at all. What she's doing is out of courtesy and more than enough. Don't expect more. Don't ask her for more.", "A lot of people are saying that the wife is treating the stepdaughter as a second class family member but I don't see that? Like she's not that teenage girls mom. She doesn't want to be her mom or to be called her mom. Why is that bad? She isn't treating her poorly. She's just firm on bot being her mom. Because she's not. And why would her side of the family treat her like the other kids? They don't even know her and she's not related. YTA you can't force your wife to adopt a teenager she doesn't want.", "YTA\n\nYour wife made it clear for you she was not ready to be a stepmom.

Your daughter deserves the same treatment as the others. It's not your daughters fault she's in this situation. Your wife sounds like a real treat.", "Your wife sounds terrible. \n\nThis news was new to both you and Claire and she doesn\u2019t deserve to be treated like that.", "YTA. You knowingly set up a situation where your child would be a second class citizen. You should have let your wife walk away when she wanted to, but instead you guilted her into staying and she has stepped up to do way more than she wanted to originally. But of course Claire is going to see her as a mom and is hurtful that she can't/won't be that for Claire. Your wife is a bit of an AH for the arrangement at all, but it sounds like she was brow-beaten into it and getting a divorce when you're about to have newborn twins is a terrifying thought. This is mostly on you. Your wife told you her boundaries, that she wasn't willing to parent another woman's child with you, and you ignored them and now everyone is suffering.", "Wow you both suck. YTA for staying with Lisa and allowing her to treat your daughter this way and agreeing that it was ok. Your poor kid stuck in the middle of this mess. Best thing you can do all round is split up and put your kids first.", "Idk about  AH, but you\u2019re wife has no empathy or compassion", "People suggesting divorce like that shit is easy. YTA your wife is stressed enough to be pregnant TWINS and she takes care of YOUR daughter. She set her boundaries, respect them.", "Have you tried getting your friends to bully her again? Since that worked out so well the last time. You are selfish and you should have let your wife go and live her life away from this mess you created. Everything in your post is just about you and your happiness and wants.\nI feel so sorry for your children, mostly Claire.\nYTA", "NTA\nYour wife seems cold, tbh. I totally get being afraid and overwhelmed by the prospect of suddenly getting a bonus child nobody knew of before, who  has an unknown history and with twins on the way. But her being willing to kick a kid she cared for for over 3 years under the bus and deny her a deeper relationship seems cruel to me.", "NTA. Why Are you staying with this woman? If she treats Claire like that. Might not be her kid but she is yours's. Not a second-class citizen. Hope you've been honest with Claire about your wife feels. That way she knows if something happens to you. If you haven't made arrangements. Make sure there's separate insurance for Claire.", "NTA.  Your wife sounds like a monster.", "NTA, would you consider doing some serious soul searching for the sake of your daughter.  Her step mother is likely going to cause some serious emotional harm.  I mean honestly, she has enough to deal with already, given her mother will remain in prison for the duration of her childhood and young adult life.  Come on!  Someone needs to be this child's champion.", "YTA \n\nYour wife set boundaries from the start after being coerced and bullied to stay in a marriage with you and raise a random child she didn\u2019t want. Stop pushing her for more, she has done enough.\n\nFor the equal treatment thing, I\u2019m not sure why so many people are stuck on it. OP\u2019s wife is doing the same stuff as a mum, sure, but she\u2019s essentially a nanny: she takes care of Claire, is kind to her and helps her when she\u2019s needed. She is not her mum, she doesn\u2019t want to be and she doesn\u2019t need to love Claire like a mother does. Unless she\u2019s making dinner for the twins and leaving Claire to fend for herself, I don\u2019t see the issue in her not seeing them as equals - they\u2019re not. Two of them are her children, one of them is a child who lives with her.", "NAH.  I can understand why you want this to happen and it's lovely that Claire feels she has such a good relationship with Lisa. But I can see Lisa's point too.  Claire's real mum isn't dead, she's just away for a while.  If Lisa isn't comfortable taking on the mum role 100% then you shouldn't try and force it.", "YTA  big time.  The no obligation to treat Claire equally concerns the wife's family, what is honestly expected. How many stories here about mixed families and this happens ?  Lisa does literally everything a step parent should do, but because she does not want to be called mom she is a monster? Thats insane, Claire's mom was incarcerated, is not like she never existed. You cannot force anyone to love a person, but provided she is being treated with respect and cared for, what do you want from Lisa? Manipulate her into staying again? What you did was low and you know it. You should've let Lisa make her own decisions without pressure from 3rd parties. As Lisa is apparently the one who does everything for Claire (as you mentioned), maybe you should step up? This way Claire connects with you, her actual parent ?", "NTA\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have to love his daughter equally. Clearly the wife is not even capable of that.\n\nIt\u2019s not about how much she should \u201clove\u201d his daughter. It\u2019s how much she **allows** his daughter to love her. And that makes her the biggest AH of them all.", "At this point Lisa's position and concerns about ensuring she and the twins are in a loving and stable environment are moot.  You have fulfilled all your obligations on both sides.  Meanwhile poor Claire is the epitome of the step-child, not really wanted by either side but kind of tolerated and given support... then regularly reminded that she isn't wanted.  In this case Lisa's behavior indicates a lack of empathy and compassion.  Claire *isn't* her child, but she has taken on the job of being the maternal presence in this **child's** life.  The fact Lisa continues to hold her origins against her because Claire isn't \"equal to the twins\" is just pathetic. NTA for trying to make this blended family work well for everyone. You need to figure out what to do so Lisa doesn't absolutely crush Claire. I'd start with therapy for Claire, and also a college fund.", "NTA - Your wife is. Feeling so left out of your family is going to be terrible mentally for your daughter.", "You're both ah. I think you and Lisa have a very unhealthy relationship and living situation, and I think all your kids are going to have baggage from this.  I don't really think you should stay together.", "YTA to Claire. You\u2019ve put her in a situation where she\u2019s treated as lesser than her half siblings bc you were so desperate to keep your wife. Your daughter doesn\u2019t deserve this.", "ESH (not the kids)\n\nI know you said your wife helps with homework and stuff and cooks (nice to hear she doesn\u2019t make your daughter forage for her own food)\u2026Let me ask you this: When the local prince comes of age and throws a ball to find a bride, do you think your wife will allow your daughter to attend or will she be too busy helping your twins get ready while Claire picks grains of rice off the floor?", "YTA - your poor daughter why are you doing this to her? Your wife is a literal monster and your letting it happen instead of protecting her.", "She already has a mom. It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate under any circumstances.\n\nYTA", "Some real stupid teenage girls reddit AITA comments being spewed here calling him the asshole because \"he bullied her into staying with him by getting friends to talk to her\".  Everything in this post proves she's the one with the power in this relationship.\n\nFurthermore, she was pregnant with twin children. If he hadn't tried keeping the family together you'd just be crucifying him for not trying hard enough for the twins. This sub is just so unbelievably toxic to men it's insane.\n\nOP, you're NTA, but you would be if you continue staying with her knowing how she is now. You were put in a bad position, tried to make it work the best way you could, and now you should clearly be able to see it isn't going to and you need to prioritize the kid that is going to clearly be neglected versus the two that clearly aren't going to be.", "NTA. But I don\u2019t know how you can live with someone so cold. You agreed to your wife\u2019s conditions because you thought it was the only way to save your marriage. \n\nShe is now holding you hostage. Either do what she says or she\u2019ll blow up the marriage. Is that really how you want to live your life? How you want your daughter to live?", "This little girl isn\u2019t a product of you cheating. I would have really looked at what my partner was saying. This is a child that needs love and someone who wants to be her mom. Your wife can\u2019t accept her.", "Claire is not her biological child, so I think that it\u2019s only logical she would want to maintain preference for her own flesh and blood.\n\nI think it\u2019s unfortunate for Claire, but she needs to understand her situation: her actual mom is somewhere else, and she needs to behave appropriately around Lisa.\n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole for wanting the best for Claire or for desiring a stronger bond between Lisa and Claire, and neither is Lisa for resisting. I just think you need to respect Lisa\u2019s boundaries. Those boundaries aren\u2019t imaginary \u2014 blood is thicker than water.", "NTA but your wife sounds like a total monster and its not fair to Claire that the twins would be treated better then she would when she is also your child, whether or not you knew she was yours to begin with she is your child as well and deserves to be treated just the same as the others.", "NTA. Divorce your wife. She treats your daughter like garbage and the arrangement is complete crap. She's growing up to be a second class citizen. Get a parenting arrangement for the twins and get your daughter out of that situation.", "Doesn\u2019t it make you feel some type of way to know if god forbid something happen to you tomorrow that your wife would kick Claire out without hesitation or remorse? Why do you want to be with someone like that? She sounds so mean and heartless. \n\nNTA for this, but YTA for continuing to let that mean woman control you and your daughter.", "NTA - possible NAH but that depends on the future, and your wife has some serious work to do. I think it\u2019s understandable to be upset at having to deal with such an unexpected situation. Her reactions may just be fear or other emotions manifesting themselves in a bad way. She may just need more time to come down from shock, and could warm up overtime. I\u2019ve seen it happen before. She may also be cold AF and you may make no progress, I don\u2019t know her personally.\n\nIf you\u2019re financially able to handle the situation I don\u2019t really understand the harsh reaction. She\u2019s a teenager and will be pretty independent in just a couple years.\n\nIt\u2019s admirable that you are also considering the emotional impact on your daughter, and wanting to be there for more than just a place to stay. Keep that up. As for your relationship, this whole situation will just help you know much sooner if you made the right decision to be with this person.", "You are in a difficult situtation. I personaly think being called Mom is a measure of love and respect and don't understand why Lisa is so oppossed to this. Is there any terms of endearment in your language that Claire could call Lisa? \n\nCara (dear), cielo (sky), or Mon (my) Lisa are examples of words that show affection but don't involve maternal references.\n\nNTA", "ESH, and I hope Lisa doesn\u2019t ask Claire for help with anything related to the twins or expect Claire to do anything for her ever in terms of financial support, caregiving, etc. Lisa doesn\u2019t want to be Claire\u2019s mom and is okay with family not treating Claire like her siblings. To me that means Claire has no obligation to offer any time type of family support for Lisa", "um. OP.... did you read this before posting? you both suck. poor Claire. this is almost appropriate for r/AmITheDevil because you made that agreement with your evil wife?", "YTA: Lisa is not Claire\u2019s mum and Claire is not her responsibility. It\u2019s not unusual for women to feel uncomfortable with their step children calling them mum. \n\nWhen you say Lisa does not want to miscommunicate to Claire that she thinks Claire is equal to the twins, to me it seems your word choice is miscommunicating. Lisa does not want Claire to think that Lisa considers Claire her child in the same way she considers the twins her child, and having boundaries such as not calling her mum is a way to communicate these boundaries - which is a kindness. \n\n\u201cJust let her have this\u201d will do more harm than good. Claire is not 4 or 5, she is 13. Clear boundaries are important and she is just trying to get her needs met. I hope Claire is in counseling.", "YTA.\nLook, father of the year, what did you think was going to happen when you manipulated your wife into staying and THEN agreed that your daughter should be a second class citizen in her home? Of course you're an AH. Not only that but you seem to be a lacklustre husband and I genuinely worry about that little girl being left in your care.\n\nYou need to let your wife leave, and start stepping up to actually be a father because right now you are failing your entire family. Your wife, daughter AND your twins. \n\nThis is entirely on you, and you need to get your house in order or you are going to damage everyone involved - if you haven't already.", "NTA your wife is a little bit. She doesn't have to see Claire as her daughter, but she can't force Claire not to see her that way. She also doesn't get to decide how the twins view their stepsister. They'll decide that in time. Lisa clearly isn't heartless because she's helping to raise Claire, despite not signing up for this, but she should accept Claire's choice to call her mom, if she's the closest thing to a mom Claire has right now. Like everyone else here says, you need family therapy, and fast. Also bringing your friends in to pressure Lisa wasn't OK, but I do understand your main motivation was to save your marriage, and keep your family together for the twins.", "Maybe she can have a talk with Claire and tell her nicely that while she appreciates that Claire loves and respects her in that way, she can never take the place of Claire's actual birth mother - who is still alive and still her mother and is actually the one that raised and took care of her like a mother.  She can let her know that she'll always be there for her for anything she needs and will always love her.  Perhaps they can work together to find a new term of endearment that she can call her.  \nMy heart hurts for Claire who also didn't ask to be put in this difficult situation and just trying to find her way now as a young kid.

This is just a situation where two adults are trying to make the best of a bad situation. Everyone is shitting on you for begging your wife to stay but who could blame you? You loved your wife and wanted to have stable home for your twins. Most people are also shitting on your wife for resenting Claire and not seeing her as equal. Yea, Lisa does resent you and Claire to some extent but she has also stepped up in a huge way. Lisa has basically raised Claire for the last few years, she does everything a step-mom would do except let Claire call her mom. She deserves credit for that even if she isn't the perfect step-mother.\n\nI get that you don't want Claire to feel left out but I think you need to back off your wife. You already guilted/shamed/begged her into staying and raising a kid she didn't know about, didn't want, and isn't related to, if you continue to push her she may just leave you. A person can only take so much. Lisa was clear with you upfront about the kind of relationship she would tolerate and now you're pushing for more. \n\nUndoubtedly, Claire will be hurt by this but you need to really weigh the consequences. If handled thoughtfully, you may be able to spare some of Claire's feelings. For example, I would put this on Claire's bio-mom, not your wife.

Because not everyone is so miserable", "What a horrible woman.

And for OP to get friends to bully Lisa for wanting divorce is manipulation. This whole situation is wrong.", "\u201cNo, she can tell Claire that she is honored that she wants to call her Mom, but that title really belongs to someone else. She doesn't want to usurp bio-mom's place.\u201d\n\nMy stepson used to call me mom in the beginning. It wasn\u2019t because of a bond or anything. He was shit stirring, he was going out of his way to cause issues between his parents and I. And he only did it in public when I would tell him no to something. I wouldn\u2019t get mad, but I simply said something very similar to this. Every time. And his smirk would leave because he wasn\u2019t getting the reaction he had been \u2018promised\u2019 (my in-laws are garbage and toxic parasites). It\u2019s been decades since then, and me and him have a spectacular relationship. I don\u2019t need to be called mom to be one.

That being said, I have a little one of my own who calls me mom, and it would kill me if she ever called someone else mom. But I never ever considered treating him so coldly. Yes he infuriated me MANY times, but there was no time he couldn\u2019t come to me for anything and he knew that. \n\nThat being said, I think you all need therapy. Especially Claire.

That is SO, SO, SO much more than the majority of the population would do, and its disgusting to call OP's wife a 'monster' because she wasn't suddenly flooded by motherly love and adoration for a child that isn't hers.

Claire\u2019s expenses and decisions would be handled separately from the twins (ex. Op and ex would pay for her activities and decide her life/school events, while op and Lisa handle that separate for the twins) and neither extended family would be obligated to the other\u2019s children (ex.

The main issue is op didn\u2019t explain the dynamics to Claire so now she thinks she got a new/bonus mom. There\u2019s a child appropriate way to say Lisa is a trusted authority figure in her that makes sense. Which I think he should do since he\u2019s been missing all her life and they need to build a relationship. He\u2019s so focused on the motherly part but is t saying too much on the fatherly relationship he is building and solidifying. Op is slacking hard and is expecting his wife to pick up the heavy lifting. He\u2019s not trying to raise his child and is hoping he can sucker Lisa into doing it.

Now the poor child feels confused and rejected", "Because Claire is a child, you can\u2019t compare a child and an adult lol.", "That\u2019s ridiculous\n\nYou have to stop pretending that children are small sized adults. Supposedly adults have matured in their behavior and perceptions of life. Apparently there are many immature adults running around with no sense to see the differences between themselves and  a 12 year old. That\u2019s sick.", "Because kids are kids.

Only as an equal person.", "You don't need therapy to figure out why most people do not love other people's kids like their own.", "I mean it\u2019s really obvious why she resents her. She\u2019s about to start her own family and she gets a 9 year old child dropped into her lap. She debates leaving, and her husband sends a bunch of people to guilt her in response. She sets clear boundaries, and her husband tries to stomp them. It\u2019s not ok for her to treat Claire this way, but it\u2019s super obvious why she resents her.", "It's obvious why. Jealousy.

I've been a stepmom, and I always called it the toughest job you'll ever love. It IS rough, especially at first, but day-um, being unable or flat-out refusing to love a kid who's lived with you for months, is well-behaved, and loves YOU is hard to fathom, whether it's an inability or flat-out refusal. No doubt she loves the twins, but they may be the only people for whom she feels unconditional love. And holy crap, when she learned about this poor girl who'd lost her mother and had no one but her dad, the OP, she was going to *file for divorce* rather than have the girl in her life. No, she didn't sign up to be a stepmother, but that's a pretty extreme reaction. \n\nI agree that the OP shouldn't have accepted the SM's conditions, but with their twins on the way, it's not like he could just walk out. I'm also not sure his friends \"bullied\" her. I could see how she'd feel like a monster if they were telling her all the wonderful things about step-parenting and saying things like, \"You'll change your mind and love her, wait and see\" when she's either totally unable or completely unwilling to open her heart to this girl. And the fact that the OP felt he had to turn to friends says terrible things about their relationship.\n\nESH but the OP's daughter. OP shouldn't have pushed his wife to accept the term \"mom.\" OP's wife has issues and, for all her going through the motions, still keeps the OP's daughter on the other side of the wall. I feel so sorry for that poor girl. I'd take her in in a heartbeat.", "His priorities were exactly that of a father. He took responsibility for a child he just found out he fathered and he did not want to miss out on raising his twins. How the hell is that not putting the kids, all the kids, first!!!", "He also didn't believe the birth mom and did nothing to find out one way or the other. If he had done that he would've known he had a kid when his wife came along. Dude was a deadbeat dad and then forced the situation once he couldn't ignore it anymore. He sounds like a class act.", "Unless he held her hostage in that marriage, she was an adult who could have left at anytime. They both are at fault.", "Yep, definitely this. She can choose to leave or she can choose to stay, but there's an actual child involved here. Choosing to stay, but treating her as less than? That's AH behaviour.

She's going to tell a 13yo that she doesn't belong in their family, not like the twins do.\n\nObviously OP is the bigger AH - I'm unsure if his ex told him she was pregnant years ago and he didn't believe her until years later when he got a paternity test (it's a little confusingly written to me), but he got his friends to pressure his wife into staying and now he's pressuring her with emotions she's clearly not capable of feeling.\n\nPoor Claire.", "Not can\u2019t.

In this case, I think it's the correct move for the step-mom not to take on the name of mom even if she is pretty much doing the mom role.  It's good to keep the family relationships clear because teenagers get very confused about who they are and see \"doing the easy thing\"  as unexcusable lies about their identity.", "She's not pretending.

Instead of forcing motherhood on Lisa OP should be focusing on getting Claire therapy and figuring out how to navigate being a parent to a child whose other parent is in jail.", "That's exactly what I thought she meant when she said lesser than her twins. Her twins are her kids, and Claire is not her kid which is why she's\"lesser\" than the twins. It's poor word choice but to me she was saying Claire is not her kid, especially since this came up in a conversation about not wanting be called Mom by her. I didn't take it to mean she saw her less a person. Just in the relationship hierarchy.", "I mean that is what Lisa is doing\n\n>Lisa has no problem with taking Claire to school or special events, helps her with her homework, cooks her food, and gives her guidance about feminine related things.", "Nope. She was about to have twins and her husband surprised her with a kid who was obviously going to need a whole lot of time and attention devoted to her, which means best case scenario OP\u2019s wife was stuck doing more for her own twin newborns than she originally expected, and at worse would be expected to help with this other kid on top of her own.

He had never met her.  DNA match on one of those sites to a distance relative.", "As someone who has actually carried twins inside my body for 38 weeks\u2026this is not an excuse. This woman sucks. \nNews flash\u2026our partners had sex before they met and married us. Probably unprotected sex sometimes. I know I did before I met my husband. It would take some getting used to, but I\u2019d 100% open my home and heart to any child my husband had with a previous relationship. The fact that this woman can\u2019t get past her own fantasy of her perfect kids being the only thing that matters is bullshit. Get over yourself! \nAlso OP sucks too.

That\u2019s so gross.", "Because he readily agreed to put Claire in a home where she is not a member of the family but is instead just some random extended visitor.

I\u2019d never be able to look someone like that in the face again.", "They are just making up the story at this point.", "I\u2019m wondering if OP is skewing this somewhat. I wonder if I\u2019m reality in the beginning wife wanted to make sure she had boundaries to protect herself (smart and advised). She clearly has feelings for this child. I wonder if part of her not wanting to be called mom is because bio mom is likely to come up and take her daughter back once out of prison. I know OP has worded it \u201cshe doesn\u2019t want her on the same level as the twins\u201d but honestly it just doesn\u2019t fit based on the caring way she treats this child for me.", "This is not even remotely the same as parental love.

It would've crushed me and I had a comparatively good history to Claire before that.", "But it\u2019s also not that long. I had to care for on and off my boyfriends little sister due to family issues. She was a difficult preteen. I did my best because she was a child. But I was in my early 20s. I did not want a child.

It was possible she would be permanently placed with me, and I am deeply grateful that did not end up happening.

He didn't believe the ex when she informed him via social services.", "And? That doesn\u2019t counter their argument in any way.", "Yeah it doesn't sound like she's saying Claire is less valuable as a person as the twins.

Can I make you popcorn on the stove and watch your favorite movie with you? Awesome!", "Treating the child as disposable would not include driving the kid not only to school but also to events, helping her with homework, and feeding her. None of that suggests she's treating this child as disposable. She even says that she cares about the child. She just doesn't feel like a mother to her, and doesn't want the child to see her as a mother. Which is a completely reasonable boundary for a step parent to have for a surprise stepchild that you have grown to care for. She has already compromised on many of her boundaries, she should not have to compromise on yet another one for everyone else's sake.", "She\u2019s not treating the kid like she\u2019s disposable.

All reasonable.\n\nOP is the asshole for continuing to push boundaries when Lisa has already made compromises- she takes the child to school, events, explained personal hygiene.
