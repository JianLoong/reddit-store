You've indicated one of your boundaries, and your girlfriend is trying to ignore/cross it. She's the A.", "NTA. There are probably people who she's had longer non-sexual relationships with that can check in on her daughter who her daughter likes and feels safe with. Maybe her daughter can stay at a friend or relative's place.", "NTA. A 26M spending 4 days supervising a 15F is an awful idea, even if you and she got along. Her not liking you is asking for trouble. Her mother should make more appropriate arrangement", "NTA, But this might be a good opportunity to get more if a team spirit with the daughter. Tell her \"Hey. Your mom wants me to do this. I get the feeling you don't like me much, which is fine, and  I'm kinda uncomfortable babysitting you when you're 15 and I'm 26.

How do we skin this cat?", "NTA, you shouldn\u2019t if you\u2019re uncomfortable with it (which is understandable). But maybe now is the time to consider that if you aren\u2019t prepared to be friendly with her daughter or try to make an effort at being friendly with her, are you really right for this woman?

Its your decision if you want to babysit or not.", "NTA who'd wanna jump into that minefield.

You are worried the 15yo doesn\u2019t like you and could say things that are untrue? Yes? This is what jumped out. I say after thought, NTA.

Nope not happening.", "NTA if you\u2019re uncomfortable, you absolutely have the right to say no.", "NTA. I definitely wouldn\u2019t be  comfortable with this if I were you. It\u2019s basically asking for more friction between you and the daughter, since now you\u2019re being made the person who has to tell on her when you\u2019re closer in age to her than her mother. Teenagers aren\u2019t the most rational, she might not respond very well.\n\nI think it would be much more conducive to a long term relationship if you were to remain pretty hands-off with her in terms of parenting. That\u2019s the best route to a cordial respectful relationship down the line, where she speaks about you like \u2018he\u2019s alright, he never really tried to parent me, he just respects my space\u2019. That\u2019s what you want.", "NTA. You didn't need to give her a reason. No is a complete answer.

Innocent actions could be misinterpreted, some conflict might arise, or she might make some sort of accusation. \n\nI can see why you said no and your gf should make other arrangements. If the bio dad isn\u2019t in the picture, doesn\u2019t your gf have a female friend, neighbor or maybe even a teacher from the girl\u2019s school who could keep an eye on her? Or the girl might be able to stay with one of her friends that weekend.", "NTA. Wise call. \n\nIf she asked you to be on call in case her daughter had a problem, and you'd still said no, though, I would feel differently.", "NTA. It is well within your right not to babysit. Espeically if it makes you uncomfortable. However you should probably find a partner who doesn't have kids.", "NTA. So why do you need to stay over if her daughter isn't the type to cause issues?", "NTA, I was left alone at home for a week when I was 14, was my own decision as I didn't want to go to a family vacation. \n\nThe other aspect is your own safety, I don't want to assume anything, but yeah, bad stuff could be told ...", "NTA. Refuse that suggestion at all costs. As you said, it's not any drama you should be risking getting wrapped up in.", "NTA, but prolly not gonna be good for the relationship building process. If she trusted you with her daughter she may be rethinking it.", "NTA. As a mother of 2, who has done her share of dating this makes no sense to me. Does your GF not have any family or close friends to ask? I'm sure the daughter would be much more comfortable with someone she knows. \n\nIt took me years to feel like my partner and kids where close enough for me to head out on a long weekend. He loves them as him own but learning the boundaries and how to communicate properly in a family can take years of relationship building.", "I would call NTA.\n\nAs a male I have also turned down requests where I would have been placed alone in a position of being alone with a younger female.\n\nIf you have been around this teenager for so long and still do not trust what she would accuse you of, then trust your gut. There must be a reason why you have that gut feeling.\n\nOther people may say you are over sensitive, but I stand with you on this", "NTA, Your girlfriend should plan better.

I'm not surprised her kid doesn't really like you and honestly it's kind of weird that you're right in the middle age-wise so she would probably be uncomfortable with you staying just as much as you are. Though I don't know how you see this relationship working out long-term if you don't get along with her kid.", "NTA. Spending the weekend alone with a teenager is not something you should be doing if you're uncomfortable.  Your girlfriend should understand this.  However, if she does understand this she is going to rethink your relationship.  It's going to be hard to move forward with this since that daughter is always going to come first in her life.", "NTA.  If her daughter isn't the type to cause any issues, why can she not stay home by herself?  \n\nYour GF is not respecting your boundaries.", "NTA. I was staying home alone over night for a week at a time in the 10th grade. If her mother doesn\u2019t trust her then recommend she stay with a friend.", "NTA. This is a situation that could go bad in a very big way. The teen daughter doesn't care for you and all she needs to do is make an accusation are her problems are solved! Yours, on the other hand, would just be getting started. I am surprised your gf doesn't see the potential issue here.\n\nDoesn't this girl have a friend she could stay with or a relative that could stay with her?", "NTA\n\nThis relatuonship has all kinds of weirdness about it.", "NTA\n\nAnd why isn't the girlfriend asking the daughter if it's alright whether or not OP is around the house for the weekend. Her daughter deserves to feel just as comfortable. \n\nWhy can't the girlfriend ask any of her daughter's friends' parents if they'd be willing to have her for just the weekend?\n\nJust seems like poor planning and miscommunication to me.", "Babysitting a fckin 15yo is hilarious to me. If she doesn't cause any problems, she should be able to take care of herself. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nIf something were to happen to her daughter, regardless of whatever, YOU would be blamed. Make your boundaries clear.", "Nta, when I was 15 I certainly wouldn't have listened to (or been particularly pleased about) my mum dating a man closer to my age than her own, icky", "Must admit, I would be uncomfortable staying in a place, with just me and a teenage unrelated girl. People talk, rumours start.  \n\n\nHowever, you are dating a woman, and her and her family come as a package. If you dont want the daughter in your life, dont date the mother.

I can understand worrying about her going somewhere, but she\u2019s 15 and should be trusted.", "Nta. Thats the best thing you can do. If her daughter dislike you, stay away from her. \nBetter safe than sorry", "NTA. You'd be no ahole even if you turned down watching a younger child for 10 minutes because she asked and you had a right to answer HOWEVER you wanted, but in this case I can't really see a moral fault or relational fault. She said you're childish but it seems to me you had a very mature argument in your head, you assessed the situation, figured out she doesn't even probably want you around in the first place, that your age and sex could be problematic in some scenarios and you decided you don't want any possible issue. This is being prudent and intelligent in my opinion.", "NTA\n\nUmm why would the daughter want to be in a house with someone she isn\u2019t comfortable with? Does your gf have friends that can stay with her daughter?", "NTA and your girlfriend is throwing up some big read flags as a parent. If you want kids long term, think about if you are comfortable with her parenting/decision making abilities when it comes to protecting her kids. Luckily for her you are a decent guy, but all guys are not.", "NTA, unfortunately there're more than enough stories of children telling lies about their parents partners. If she really hates you and tells someone you touched her, your life is over.", "NTA  The child is her responsibility and dating the mother doesn't make her yours.  Stick to your guns on this.", "NTA.  Smart man.  All you need is her to call the police on you for something and you will be in a world of shit.", "NTA\n\nGotta protect yourself here. You have no idea what the teenage girl will do that'll get you in trouble.", "You're a very very very smart man. I understand your fear what if she wants to go out and you tell her no and she makes something up and now you're in prison for 10 years for the worst possible thing you can go to Prison for. Scary thing is no one ever believes the guy", "NTA \nI wouldn\u2019t either. Mostly to protect myself from rumors and lies that could be told. I\u2019m not risking prison for a 15yr old who doesn\u2019t even like me. You don\u2019t know her well, and you don\u2019t know what she\u2019s capable of. Plus at 15 she should be able to look after herself for a few days.", "Nope. What would she do if she wasn\u2019t dating you? Whatever that is, is what she should do now. It gets dicey when significant others babysit children old enough to genuinely dislike them. ESPECIALLY for 3 days", "NTA. You might have dodged a bullet there. Yes, if you are dating this woman and intend to keep dating her you'll have to improve your relationship with her daughter, however teenagers can be very trick in manipulating situations so it is wise to avoid certain situations.   \nINFO: Have you tried to talk to the daughter yet, to learn why and if she doesn't like you?", "NTA do NOT stay there", "NTA But you're smart for recognizing the danger this could pose for you", "NTA at all.", "A compromise would be to find a friend for her to stay with, and you could be on call if there's a problem.     \nHow does your girlfriend think you'll be able to stop the daughter going out?    \n\nNTA", "NTA a 15 yr that \"isn't the type to cause any problems\" should be able to stay home alone overnight. As an alternTive you could Offer to leave ur number with the daughter in case of emergency and that you can check in, but won't be staying.", "NAH for now... but you will become one if you don't make more effort to be integrated to her life. What is your end game here ? At some point, won't you want to move in with her ? What will happen then if she have to leave for a day or 2 ?\n\nDating someone with kids is not something to take lightly. Either you integrate with her life and learn to be part of the family, either you move on and find someone with a lifestyle that suits you best.", "NTA, especially since you are 1 bad argument about not being allowed to go out at 11pm away from being in prison for a false rape allegation", "NTA!! And what if that girl accuses you of doing something she feel is inappropriate.. that\u2019s drama going do not want!!!!!", "Why the fuck does a 15 year old need a babysitter. Thats like 2-3 years past when a kid can handle being alone for a weekend.", "NAH but...I don't see how this relationship could continue if you don't wnt the drama of a teen girl. That teen girl is a big part, if not the biggest part, of your girlfriend's life. Your attitude is that she's dramatic and might falsely accuse you of sexual assault if you're left alone with her, per one of your other comments. It's hard to see how this relationship can continue unless you get over that because she's not going to abandon her daughter for you.", "NTA, you should NOT stay the night there with a 15yo girl.  You don't need to take any chances with a hormonal teenager that does not like you.  Just don't!", "NTA but you have to decide if this is a relationship you want to pursue long term. Kid is not going anywhere and this won't be the last time you are asked to babysit. If you're not comfy with it now chances are this won't change much, and you won't be comfy with it later", "NTA. Trust your gut.\n\nIf you feel her daughter doesn't like you don't be alone with her.\nShe could accuse you of all kinds of things.\n\nBTW Your girlfriend doesn't get to call you childish in a disagreement because she is 12 years older than you.\nSounds to me like she thinks she can control you because in her mind she is  older and wiser than you.", "NTA\n\nThat sounds like a trap.", "NTA. Protect yourself.", "INFO\n\nDo you intend to keep dating ? If you see along term thing then her daughter and her are a package you can't just be like nope not building a relationship too much drama", "NTA.\n\nMove on and find someone who respects boundaries", "NTA! I'm in a situation similar to your partner (single mom to a teen girl). I can understand being absolutely stuck for child care. I've had to cancel important work things because I couldn't arrange child coverage. It sucked and had negative impacts on my job. HOWEVER: I would never leave my kid with someone for a weekend who expressed discomfort (which you have every reason for doing). I think you are being incredibly smart here, and acknowledging the limits of your relationship in general and with her daughter in particular.\nThere is definitely a Catch -22 in this though.... I would not leave my kid with an adult man who offered /enthusiastically WANTED extensive alone time with my kid, and at the same time, one who declines because it is a terrible idea, is demonstrating exactly the kind of judgement that would make me inclined to trust them enough to even consider it.", "Totally NTA. Maybe I'm paranoid but you'd better avoid this type of situation. And from the girl's perspective, I don't think she would feel safe or comfortable staying with you, an adult men who she barely knows, no offense.", "Nta, but you probably shouldn't date someone with a child of you are uncomfortable with being alone with said child.", "NTA", "Going with NAH. \n\nThis is a unique case because you're actually closer in age to the daughter than your girlfriend. I can see worrying about being a 26m spending the weekend with a 15f to whom you aren't related. Even if the weekend is 100% above board the optics are a little cringey.\n\nFactor in that you work together, and your girlfriend will be at an HR thing. I could see her casually mentioning that you're staying with her daughter and that raising some eyebrows. I can see you worrying about how that might impact how people in your profession see you. No matter how innocent the weekend.\n\nThat said, I don't blame your girlfriend at all for wanting her partner to help her when she's out of town. I'd recommend trying to have a calm chat with her to bring up your concerns, emphasizing that she can trust you as a partner with whom to build a future, but this is a unique case.", "NTA", "Dude if you don't want to babysit, don't date someone with a child.", "Holy safeguarding concerns Batman!\n\nThat\u2019s inappropriate and very risky for you. Especially if the teenager doesn\u2019t really like you. False accusations have been made, often. And have had devastating effects on the accused person, even after being completely exonerated. \n\nDon\u2019t do it mate.", "NTA!  When you stated that it wasn't a good idea because the 15yo doesn't like you, how did they respond? Did they agree, deny, or defend?  Also, if you have felt this way and your girlfriend hasn't recognized her daughter's attitude/behavior towards you after a year of dating, that may be the deeper issue. \n\nPlease don't let them talk you into this because even if she had no intention of causing you problems, now the seed could have inadvertently been planted.", "You're absolutely right, and this is a hill worth dying on.

Does she have family in the area that can help? what about teen's dad? Are there other options? If you dont want to be involved at all, i would reconsider your relationship. Do you EVER want kids and if so, what does that look like for her? Are you going to live with her? If so you will be responsible for her eventually. You have a lot to think about.", "Why are you dating a 38 year old lol", "NTA but you should also probably find another gf, you obviously dont want to date someone with a child", "Buddy, end this now. If your relationship progresses, you might be *living* with a fairly self sufficient fifteen year old. If you can\u2019t/won\u2019t suck it up for a few days, this is a *test*.

You\u2019re planning on potentially living with someone with a teenage girl yet you don\u2019t want to babysit because the last thing you need in your life is drama caused by a teenage girl.

What's the plan then?\n\nYou've invented this idea that there'll be \"drama\" just because you \"get the impression\" her daughter doesn't like you. Did you think to ask what she actually thinks?\n\nForget \"drama\", grow up, do your girlfriend a favour and I dunno, maybe try bonding with her kid?", "YTA. That last sentence sounds so off to me. You sound condescending. You don't need \"drama caused by a teen girl\" but you don't even know if there would be some drama. Maybe that's what is off, it sounds as if since she is a teenage girl then drama is unavoidable because you can't imagine that teenage girls do not create drama. Your assumptions sounds condescending at best, mysoginistic at worst. You insist about the \"teenage girl\" as if teenage girls are a different species, while you also admit she is pretty independant. To me it just sounds like you have bias against teenage girls (i bet my ass around women in general)\n\nEdit: you are not an asshole for refusing what your partner asked you, it is well within your right and i am not even sure a 15 years old need a babysitter. However you are still very much the asshole for the way you talk about her and no wonder she doesn't like you if you can't get passed the \"teenage girl\" and see who she is", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So i would still call op out. The word drama is way less associated to boys, it might be a cultural difference but the word is waaaaay less used to describe or talk about teenage boys.

He didn't say he didn't want to deal with teenage girl drama but he said he didn't want to deal with drama caused by a teenage girl. Those are 2 very different things.
