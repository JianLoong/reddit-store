She signed the contract in **May** of this year. They originally gave her until July to find a place. But it keeps getting extended. Long story short is my friends are being very very nice. My mother already found another place. \n\nThe problem is is that she is the world\u2019s biggest worry wort. She keeps asking for extension from buyers and bugging me about literal nonsense. For example, she told me the basement was \u2018flooded\u2019 and I needed to check it out ASAP. When I got there, there was maybe a 2 inch spot along the wall that was moisture. I fixed it. \n\nNext she said the water had too much rust in it, so I had my plumber come out and replace the water heater and install a new water softener. Since then, she has called him 6 times about it. He basically told me that everything is fine- it is, and that he wasn\u2019t going to be taking any more calls from her. She is stilled worried about water for some reason. \n\nLiterally the littlest thing will send her over the edge. \n\nHere\u2019s the kicker, the house has all inspections done. They all passed. It\u2019s literally ready to go. However, she sees one thing wrong and calls me and freaks out about it claiming that \u201cshe doesn\u2019t want to be sued\u201d \n\nI sympathize with her but my friends are getting angry and I don\u2019t blame them. I am an only son, so I do pretty much everything myself. Anytime something significant happens, I\u2019m usually her first call. \n\nCouple that with 4 hours of mowing every week, on top of yard work and house work and I\u2019m starting to get annoyed real fast. I feel like I spend more time at her house rather than my own- and I just bought a house a year ago and actually have a bunch of shit to get done. \n\nSo yeah, today after telling me the gutters were clogged- **they have a leaf guard** she told me that she was going to ask for another extension. I told her politely that I was going to stop helping her out. \n\nWe\u2019ve had these talks before but she just can\u2019t overcome her irrationality. She\u2019s spoken to friends, family, her psychiatrist, her financial advisor, all trying to tell her that she\u2019s in a good spot, but she just doesn\u2019t believe it. \n\nP.S. she is very financially stable. \n\nP.S.S.

Her irrationality & problems with change are hers to manage.\n\nLet your friends know you are taking a big step back and you disagree with her delaying tactics so let the chips fall where they fall.  It\u2019s up to the buyers and their advisors to decide how to move forward.  Or back out.", "NTA.  I get your mother's hesitancy to separate from the place that she shared with your father and/or her anxieties over relocating.  It honestly has not been that long since she lost him and grief can do weird things to our sense of self and security going forward. That said, her reliance on your helping maintain the place is clearly more than you are up for and she needs to follow through on her decision to move.  \n\nMaybe your ultimatum will help her move forward.  She's been able to commandeer your time and attention and maybe that is really what all this is about.  Let her know you're ready to help her move to her new place when she is finally ready but until then she will need to hire others to attend to matters pertaining to her present abode.  She needs to understand that you also have personal responsibilities that you have not been able to address because you are constantly involved with her home issues and that you are done setting all your own concerns aside.  Honestly, I suspect she is happy to have you near and these shenanigans have accomplished that to this point.\n\nSorry for the loss of your dad and good luck in getting Mom relocated.", "NTA.  Tell your friends to not approve another extension to force the issue.  She is likely anxious about not having her husband to rely on and maybe doesn't trust her own instincts.  Maybe she needs some grief counseling", "NTA\n\nThere is no reason for you to help her anymore, she needs a therapist and possible anxiety medicine.  If being sued is her concern, add a clause in the paperwork that says as is for the sell.  In most places a used home sale is already on an as is basis, and this is why they get inspections.  \n\nGood luck OP, she is a handful.", "NTA\n\nIs it possible that she doesn't want to let go of the house because losing it and being uprooted, would be like a second bereavement so soon after the first? And her anxiety is a manifestation of that, expressing itself as a reluctance to sell the house because (allegedly) there might be something wrong with it?", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she doesn't want to let go. If she keeps up with extensions she's gonna lose the buyers...", "NTA. Also, what in the world??\n\nIf she asks for another extension, your friends should deny her.\n\nFrankly, you and your friends are being too nice and enabling her irrationality!", "NTA- you've done alot, but her house isn't your responsibility. Plus, she's been dragging this along despite the inspection passing it. \n\nShe needs to stop bearing the responsibility on you and stop extending.", "NTA but your mother obviously has more attachment to the house than she lets on. Her husband passed less than a year ago. Based on your timeline, your father passed in Feb ish, and she signed the contract in May? \n\nObviously she\u2019s not dealing with it the best way, but I sympathize for her. I hope you can find a way to talk to her and maybe help reassure her, whether it\u2019s that she will be ok, or that shes not letting go of your fathers memories by moving out of the house they lived together.", "NTA - Usually the mother has to push the little bird out of the nest, this time its the other way around.", "NTA - fyi I am a widow.  She may hate the house, but she is afraid to move.  She is afraid of everything, and so she is inventing reasons to stay.\n\nWhile she needs therapy, she also needs to get out of the house because she can\u2019t maintain it and she has a sales contract on it and we are going into a bad period for sellers because of interests rates.\n\nSo, you need to help her move.  She needs someone to build up her self confidence and self esteem that she is doing the right thing.  You need to help her pack and move.  Has she even packed yet?  She may be having trouble letting go of the house.  Remind her that she has the memories and mementos that she will always have with her.\n\nSit her down and say it\u2019s time to fish or cut bait.  She either needs to pack up and move or cancel the sale contract and stay.  Dragging this out  is not helpful for her or the new buyers.  You need to facilitate her making the decision.\n\nWhen you lose your spouse, it is not same grief as losing a parent.  As a grown adult, you are already on your own, so while losing your dad is tragic, you can still function because your lifestyle isn\u2019t being disrupted.  When you lose a spouse, you go from being half of a couple to a single person.  This leaves a wound on your soul that has to heal.  You go from sharing decisions with your spouse or at least having a backup to your decisions, to being all alone, all the decisions are on you, and you haven\u2019t been solely responsible for decision making in years, if ever.  You can become paralyzed by fear of making the wrong decision.\n\nSo, you need to help your mother get over her fear, and help her get unstuck so she can transition to the next chapter of her life.  I highly recommend you get her the book widow to widow.  It\u2019s an easy read and quite helpful.  One rule of thumb is to not make any major decisions in the first year because you are grieving and prone to make impulsive unwise decisions.  I don\u2019t know if selling the house now is unwise or not.\n\nDon\u2019t make the decision for your mom, but do force her to make a decision one way or the other.  She is leaving herself and the buyers in limbo.  She needs to move forward or cancel, and you need to support whatever decision she makes.  Stop supporting her efforts to stay in limbo.\n\nHope this helps.", "NTA, and what she is going to get sued for is not proceeding with the sale contract.", "Ask her what day you should have the movers come and other than that you\u2019re done helping.\n\n I\u2019d also suggest to friends that they might want to pursue canceling the purchase (or have them threaten to) bc at this rate they\u2019ll have signed for a home they don\u2019t own for at least a year.", "Nta but your mom is nuts.  Face up to the fact she has mental issues. Quit enabling her and get her in therapy.", "NAH. She has unprocessed grief. If she moves, the reality of your father's death becomes complete. She needs a counselor. Which she can get from her new home. \n\nHow are you doing?", "NAH. The house is clearly not the problem, your mother has something else going on (whether it's grief, anxiety, idk). A little bit of tough love might be the best remedy here. Perhaps it would be good of you and your friends to make it clear the next deadline is the final one.", "I don\u2019t think you are wrong but I can see your mom\u2019s worries. This will be a huge decision that\u2019s she\u2019s gonna have to make on her own. She wants to make sure the house she had her late husband in, is ready for a new family. I wouldn\u2019t doubt if it makes her sad, worried, and maybe even excited she gets to help a new family. Maybe sit down with her or with a trusted counselor (church member, therapist, lawyer, etc.) and see what exactly the delay is. Maybe if it\u2019s reinforced by another person, she\u2019ll be at ease. At least you\u2019ll know what that\u2019s going on with her and hopefully move on \ud83d\udc9c", "As someone who suffers from very high levels of anxiety, I can sympathise with your mum.  People are putting forward the rational and sensible viewpoint that she is in a good spot, but she is responding on an emotional level rather than a rational level. I do this too when highly anxious, and it is really stressful.  With your father gone, she is probably feeling very alone and that she will be the only one to blame if things go wrong after selling.  Maybe she should put selling and  moving on hold for a while and see if this helps her to feel calmer.  I can understand how frustrating this is for you and for your friends, but  maybe it might be the only way forward. NAH.", "Omg. She just lost her husband. She is having major anxiety over all of these huge life changes happening at once. She is overwhelmed, and getting ready to have a nervous breakdown.

Her husband passed 7 months ago, man she probably spend most of her life and managed all this little \"problems\" like fixing and managing, maintaining house, all of sudden her whole world is upside down and selling house might make her feel that little control she has is gone because it's not easy to loose husband and \"loose\" house so fast. Grief can make us feel powerless and lost and she is grasping for this house because I believe there is history there, place they made family. \n\nI agree with OP but his mom is not \"bad guy\" just woman who's grieving and has problem to  move on.\n\nShe needs therapy, which seems that she has but grief has own way to make us frozen in time.\n\nEdit (correct spellings)", "And express to your friends that you are not going to get in the middle.", "Yes! Also want to add - maybe your helping her is her way of feeling connected to you (especially after such a huge loss, I can imagine her connection to you means even more to her). It may be helpful to open up a discussion of how she\u2019s been feeling, perhaps suggest therapy, and reassure her that you will still be there for her (maybe offer up a once-a-week lunch or something). You\u2019re not wrong at all, and your frustrations are very fair, don\u2019t get me wrong. There are empathetic ways of navigating this that can get you both what you need. Good luck!", "That's probably a component of her motivation, and I would guess there's also the dread of the labor of moving, and anxiety over having to deal with the new home and fitting into the new community.\n\nBut if she keeps dealing with her feelings through procrastination, there is going to be trouble. The contracts are signed, can the new owners sue her or evict her?", "Yeah and I lost my dad. And I\u2019m also overwhelmed trying to fill his role and still live my own life. Especially when no matter how hard I try, no progress is being made. The only way I know how to help her feel less overwhelmed is by helping her, which I\u2019ve been doing for 7 months now. \n\nMy friends didn\u2019t even try to negotiate and gave her exactly she wanted for the house. They have a right to be unhappy as their is a contract in place and she isn\u2019t abiding by it.", "I appreciate and respect your POV.  Valid points.\n\nTwo factors weighed out heavily for me.  One, per OP, mom hates the house.  Two, mom is financially stable.\n\nNo where does Op say mom was forced to put the house/land on the market.\n\nWhile I'm both empathetic and sympathetic to mom, she could have made a different decision.

When is enough enough?  \n\nWhatever the answer, mom has to find it, not Op.", "I\u2019d bet the lion\u2019s share of what is going on is the dread of the actual moving. Not only the awful under any circumstances act of moving, but everything that it brings up. Does she move spouse stuff? Donate? Offer it to friends and family? Partial estate sale? My mom was able to stay in the house after my dad passed, and it took her *years* to get through even just his clothes and stuff.\n\nOP, if you happen to see this, I would tell your mom the only help you can offer her at this point is moving. If you can find a company that will do it all, box it all up and everything, it\u2019s probably for the best. It\u2019s tough that she really didn\u2019t have a choice in all this, and it sounds like she\u2019s experiencing complicated grief.  But extensions are not going to help any of that.\n\nAnd express to your friends that you are not going to get in the middle. Or be mad at them when they stop granting extensions and insist on taking possession of the house.", "My MIL is like that. Dad died 2 years ago and she is 86yo. Before he died, she tried to convince him to sell their house and then buy a retirement flat in a new block nearby. The house would JUST ABOUT sell for enough to buy the flat outright, but Dad would no longer have a garden or workshop to potter about in and the annual service charge would have stretched them financially.\n\nShe can\u2019t cope with the house, she can\u2019t afford a 2bed, but she is now single so could afford a 1bed even with the annual charge. But she wants a 2 bed for all her craft stuff, which she can NOT afford in that particular block. We point out other properties - that one is ground floor so lacks security, it must have a balcony so she can sit outside, that block is too far to walk from, this block looks horrible, the other block means a uphill walk and t\u2019other is too far from M&S.\n\nWe know that she will either die in the house, OR end up in a home\u2026\n\nSometimes you have to cut them off to make them actually see sense. NTA", "The problem is something is going to inevitably break in between when the contracts were signed and they should have taken possession of the house and when they will actually take possession of the house and as she's technically a renter now she will be the one responsible for the damage! Does she not realize that things in houses break and the longer she's there the more she's going to have to repair?\n\nYou need to put your foot down and say no there will be no more extensions. Then you need to call your friends and explain to them that the only way this is going to stop is if they also say no there are no more extensions. With you and the buyers on the same side she will have no choice.\n\nLook I get the thing with being sued, because my mom's going to be sued one day! Because her husband put an empty bucket in the ceiling to catch the water from a slow leak, and then he patched the ceiling. He never fixed the leak! That bucket takes about 2 years to fill so any day now that bucket is going to overflow and when they open that ceiling to figure out where the water is coming from and they find a bucket full up there... My mom's getting sued! What's going to suck is that her husband is dead now so he can't even face consequences of his actions. My mom's neighbor got sued. They had a crack in the foundation and it would have been very expensive to fix, so they put a wall in front of it. Then they sold the house. Eventually the new people figured it out (I forget exactly why it's been years) and when they opened that wall up and saw all the cracks, they sued and won!\n\nI told you these two stories because they have one thing in common, covering up problems instead of fixing them or even just disclosing them. If there is something hidden that your mother did, yeah she might get sued for that.

Only a person who has lost a spouse/partner can understand some of what she is experiencing. Getting her connected with other people who have lost a partner can provide some good support. I know she can't take care of the property, but that was a quick decision on selling in the middle of of new grief. \n\nInstead of everyone saying \"me', maybe some help with letting go and understanding she won't forget or be leaving your dad is what needs to happen.
