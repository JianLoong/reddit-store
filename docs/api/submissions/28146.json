She can\u2019t keep up with the house herself- 4 bedroom house on 9 acres of land, so she is actively selling it. \n\nMy friends (younger couple) are the potential buyers. She signed the contract in **May** of this year. They originally gave her until July to find a place. But it keeps getting extended. Long story short is my friends are being very very nice. My mother already found another place. \n\nThe problem is is that she is the world\u2019s biggest worry wort. She keeps asking for extension from buyers and bugging me about literal nonsense. For example, she told me the basement was \u2018flooded\u2019 and I needed to check it out ASAP. When I got there, there was maybe a 2 inch spot along the wall that was moisture. I fixed it. \n\nNext she said the water had too much rust in it, so I had my plumber come out and replace the water heater and install a new water softener. Since then, she has called him 6 times about it. He basically told me that everything is fine- it is, and that he wasn\u2019t going to be taking any more calls from her. She is stilled worried about water for some reason. \n\nLiterally the littlest thing will send her over the edge. \n\nHere\u2019s the kicker, the house has all inspections done. They all passed. It\u2019s literally ready to go. However, she sees one thing wrong and calls me and freaks out about it claiming that \u201cshe doesn\u2019t want to be sued\u201d \n\nI sympathize with her but my friends are getting angry and I don\u2019t blame them. I am an only son, so I do pretty much everything myself. Anytime something significant happens, I\u2019m usually her first call. \n\nCouple that with 4 hours of mowing every week, on top of yard work and house work and I\u2019m starting to get annoyed real fast. I feel like I spend more time at her house rather than my own- and I just bought a house a year ago and actually have a bunch of shit to get done. \n\nSo yeah, today after telling me the gutters were clogged- **they have a leaf guard** she told me that she was going to ask for another extension. I told her politely that I was going to stop helping her out. \n\nWe\u2019ve had these talks before but she just can\u2019t overcome her irrationality. She\u2019s spoken to friends, family, her psychiatrist, her financial advisor, all trying to tell her that she\u2019s in a good spot, but she just doesn\u2019t believe it. \n\nP.S. she is very financially stable. \n\nP.S.S. She hates the house and has for a long time", "created_utc": 1696342602, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yt470/aita_for_telling_my_mother_i_am_going_to_stop/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her irrationality & problems with change are hers to manage.\n\nLet your friends know you are taking a big step back and you disagree with her delaying tactics so let the chips fall where they fall.  It\u2019s up to the buyers and their advisors to decide how to move forward.  Or back out.", "NTA.  I get your mother's hesitancy to separate from the place that she shared with your father and/or her anxieties over relocating.  It honestly has not been that long since she lost him and grief can do weird things to our sense of self and security going forward. That said, her reliance on your helping maintain the place is clearly more than you are up for and she needs to follow through on her decision to move.  \n\nMaybe your ultimatum will help her move forward.  She's been able to commandeer your time and attention and maybe that is really what all this is about.  Let her know you're ready to help her move to her new place when she is finally ready but until then she will need to hire others to attend to matters pertaining to her present abode.  She needs to understand that you also have personal responsibilities that you have not been able to address because you are constantly involved with her home issues and that you are done setting all your own concerns aside.  Honestly, I suspect she is happy to have you near and these shenanigans have accomplished that to this point.\n\nSorry for the loss of your dad and good luck in getting Mom relocated.", "NTA.  Tell your friends to not approve another extension to force the issue.  She is likely anxious about not having her husband to rely on and maybe doesn't trust her own instincts.  Maybe she needs some grief counseling", "NTA\n\nThere is no reason for you to help her anymore, she needs a therapist and possible anxiety medicine.  If being sued is her concern, add a clause in the paperwork that says as is for the sell.  In most places a used home sale is already on an as is basis, and this is why they get inspections.  \n\nGood luck OP, she is a handful.", "NTA\n\nIs it possible that she doesn't want to let go of the house because losing it and being uprooted, would be like a second bereavement so soon after the first? And her anxiety is a manifestation of that, expressing itself as a reluctance to sell the house because (allegedly) there might be something wrong with it?", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she doesn't want to let go. If she keeps up with extensions she's gonna lose the buyers...", "NTA. Also, what in the world??\n\nIf she asks for another extension, your friends should deny her.\n\nFrankly, you and your friends are being too nice and enabling her irrationality!", "NTA- you've done alot, but her house isn't your responsibility. Plus, she's been dragging this along despite the inspection passing it. \n\nShe needs to stop bearing the responsibility on you and stop extending.", "NTA but your mother obviously has more attachment to the house than she lets on. Her husband passed less than a year ago. Based on your timeline, your father passed in Feb ish, and she signed the contract in May? \n\nObviously she\u2019s not dealing with it the best way, but I sympathize for her. I hope you can find a way to talk to her and maybe help reassure her, whether it\u2019s that she will be ok, or that shes not letting go of your fathers memories by moving out of the house they lived together.", "NTA - Usually the mother has to push the little bird out of the nest, this time its the other way around.", "NTA - fyi I am a widow.  She may hate the house, but she is afraid to move.  She is afraid of everything, and so she is inventing reasons to stay.\n\nWhile she needs therapy, she also needs to get out of the house because she can\u2019t maintain it and she has a sales contract on it and we are going into a bad period for sellers because of interests rates.\n\nSo, you need to help her move.  She needs someone to build up her self confidence and self esteem that she is doing the right thing.  You need to help her pack and move.  Has she even packed yet?  She may be having trouble letting go of the house.  Remind her that she has the memories and mementos that she will always have with her.\n\nSit her down and say it\u2019s time to fish or cut bait.  She either needs to pack up and move or cancel the sale contract and stay.  Dragging this out  is not helpful for her or the new buyers.  You need to facilitate her making the decision.\n\nWhen you lose your spouse, it is not same grief as losing a parent.  As a grown adult, you are already on your own, so while losing your dad is tragic, you can still function because your lifestyle isn\u2019t being disrupted.  When you lose a spouse, you go from being half of a couple to a single person.  This leaves a wound on your soul that has to heal.  You go from sharing decisions with your spouse or at least having a backup to your decisions, to being all alone, all the decisions are on you, and you haven\u2019t been solely responsible for decision making in years, if ever.  You can become paralyzed by fear of making the wrong decision.\n\nSo, you need to help your mother get over her fear, and help her get unstuck so she can transition to the next chapter of her life.  I highly recommend you get her the book widow to widow.  It\u2019s an easy read and quite helpful.  One rule of thumb is to not make any major decisions in the first year because you are grieving and prone to make impulsive unwise decisions.  I don\u2019t know if selling the house now is unwise or not.\n\nDon\u2019t make the decision for your mom, but do force her to make a decision one way or the other.  She is leaving herself and the buyers in limbo.  She needs to move forward or cancel, and you need to support whatever decision she makes.  Stop supporting her efforts to stay in limbo.\n\nHope this helps.", "NTA, and what she is going to get sued for is not proceeding with the sale contract.", "Ask her what day you should have the movers come and other than that you\u2019re done helping.\n\n I\u2019d also suggest to friends that they might want to pursue canceling the purchase (or have them threaten to) bc at this rate they\u2019ll have signed for a home they don\u2019t own for at least a year.", "Nta but your mom is nuts.  Face up to the fact she has mental issues. Quit enabling her and get her in therapy.", "NAH. She has unprocessed grief. If she moves, the reality of your father's death becomes complete. She needs a counselor. Which she can get from her new home. \n\nHow are you doing?", "NAH. The house is clearly not the problem, your mother has something else going on (whether it's grief, anxiety, idk). A little bit of tough love might be the best remedy here. Perhaps it would be good of you and your friends to make it clear the next deadline is the final one.", "I don\u2019t think you are wrong but I can see your mom\u2019s worries. This will be a huge decision that\u2019s she\u2019s gonna have to make on her own. She wants to make sure the house she had her late husband in, is ready for a new family. I wouldn\u2019t doubt if it makes her sad, worried, and maybe even excited she gets to help a new family. Maybe sit down with her or with a trusted counselor (church member, therapist, lawyer, etc.) and see what exactly the delay is. Maybe if it\u2019s reinforced by another person, she\u2019ll be at ease. At least you\u2019ll know what that\u2019s going on with her and hopefully move on \ud83d\udc9c", "As someone who suffers from very high levels of anxiety, I can sympathise with your mum.  People are putting forward the rational and sensible viewpoint that she is in a good spot, but she is responding on an emotional level rather than a rational level. I do this too when highly anxious, and it is really stressful.  With your father gone, she is probably feeling very alone and that she will be the only one to blame if things go wrong after selling.  Maybe she should put selling and  moving on hold for a while and see if this helps her to feel calmer.  I can understand how frustrating this is for you and for your friends, but  maybe it might be the only way forward. NAH.", "Omg. She just lost her husband. She is having major anxiety over all of these huge life changes happening at once. She is overwhelmed, and getting ready to have a nervous breakdown.

OP has helped her out too much if you ask me and mother needs to stop worrying about everything. If all inspections are done, then the house will be fine.", "NTA. If she's worried about being sued, could you get through to her by saying that at this stage she's much more likely to face legal action for delaying vacant possession of the property?", "NTA.  Maybe tell her she could be sued by not complying with the contract.", "tell her that she's really going to end up being sued if she doesn't vacate the house so the new owners can move in\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYour mom's grief and anxiety are what's driving all of this. \n\nPerhaps some grief work could help?\n\nOffer to go over and help her move, or just go and have coffee and say goodbye to the house with her. Maybe walk through the rooms and remember things that happened. Play a song your dad played.", "NTA. Mom needs a reality check. Go tell your friends what up and suggest they deny the extension and might want to get their attorney to give mom a nudge.", "NTA but your friends denying extensions will be a more significant ultimatum. \n\nAt this point, if I were them, I would have already pulled out of purchase and it might be better if they do.", "NTA.  Stop being nice.  Tell her the house is no longer hers and so she has to move out now or they will evict her (if they can).  They need to stop being nice and have an attorney send her a letter to get out and give her a hard deadline.  I would also tell her that unless she is calling you to be there when the moving truck comes, you will not respond to her calls either.", "NTA. I would tell your mom that the deal on her house IS going to fall through if she doesn't sign the contract now. You did the right thing; since this is a situation of her own making, you shouldn't respond to her requests from now on.", "Pretty sure your mom is--consciously or unconsciously--terrified of taking that last final, irreversible step away from the house, the memories, your father...and everything else that's wrapped up in that place. \n\nActually leaving and moving into her own new place maybe makes everything too real.\n\nYou're NTA. Your mom should be very grateful she sold to what appear to be *extremely patient* people, but she really shouldn't push it to the point they have to legally oust her.", "I am so sorry for your loss. You never make such big decisions after such a devastating loss. Your mom needs more time to grieve. She's leaving behind a lifetime. When my dad passed we all jumped to be there for my mom. At 69 she was living alone for the first time ...  ever!\nNTA but try to understand that mom is keeping herself busy to not deal with her grief. Your friends are being incredibly kind and may recognize why mom is struggling.", "Nta ur friends need to stop giving her extensions", "I agree with you that OP is NTA and her irrationality & problems are hers to manage but I don't think mom comes from bad place. Her husband passed 7 months ago, man she probably spend most of her life and managed all this little \"problems\" like fixing and managing, maintaining house, all of sudden her whole world is upside down and selling house might make her feel that little control she has is gone because it's not easy to loose husband and \"loose\" house so fast. Grief can make us feel powerless and lost and she is grasping for this house because I believe there is history there, place they made family. \n\nI agree with OP but his mom is not \"bad guy\" just woman who's grieving and has problem to  move on.\n\nShe needs therapy, which seems that she has but grief has own way to make us frozen in time.\n\nEdit (correct spellings)", "And express to your friends that you are not going to get in the middle.", "Yes! Also want to add - maybe your helping her is her way of feeling connected to you (especially after such a huge loss, I can imagine her connection to you means even more to her). It may be helpful to open up a discussion of how she\u2019s been feeling, perhaps suggest therapy, and reassure her that you will still be there for her (maybe offer up a once-a-week lunch or something). You\u2019re not wrong at all, and your frustrations are very fair, don\u2019t get me wrong. There are empathetic ways of navigating this that can get you both what you need. Good luck!", "That's probably a component of her motivation, and I would guess there's also the dread of the labor of moving, and anxiety over having to deal with the new home and fitting into the new community.\n\nBut if she keeps dealing with her feelings through procrastination, there is going to be trouble. The contracts are signed, can the new owners sue her or evict her?", "Yeah and I lost my dad. And I\u2019m also overwhelmed trying to fill his role and still live my own life. Especially when no matter how hard I try, no progress is being made. The only way I know how to help her feel less overwhelmed is by helping her, which I\u2019ve been doing for 7 months now. \n\nMy friends didn\u2019t even try to negotiate and gave her exactly she wanted for the house. They have a right to be unhappy as their is a contract in place and she isn\u2019t abiding by it.", "I appreciate and respect your POV.  Valid points.\n\nTwo factors weighed out heavily for me.  One, per OP, mom hates the house.  Two, mom is financially stable.\n\nNo where does Op say mom was forced to put the house/land on the market.\n\nWhile I'm both empathetic and sympathetic to mom, she could have made a different decision.  Meanwhile, if I put myself in the buyer's shoes, they have generously granted 4 months worth of extensions, contract signed in May 2023.  When is enough enough?  \n\nWhatever the answer, mom has to find it, not Op.", "I\u2019d bet the lion\u2019s share of what is going on is the dread of the actual moving. Not only the awful under any circumstances act of moving, but everything that it brings up. Does she move spouse stuff? Donate? Offer it to friends and family? Partial estate sale? My mom was able to stay in the house after my dad passed, and it took her *years* to get through even just his clothes and stuff.\n\nOP, if you happen to see this, I would tell your mom the only help you can offer her at this point is moving. If you can find a company that will do it all, box it all up and everything, it\u2019s probably for the best. It\u2019s tough that she really didn\u2019t have a choice in all this, and it sounds like she\u2019s experiencing complicated grief.  But extensions are not going to help any of that.\n\nAnd express to your friends that you are not going to get in the middle. Or be mad at them when they stop granting extensions and insist on taking possession of the house."]}
