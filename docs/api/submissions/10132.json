Just a thought", "Why not", "Well said. Yea OP *could* have done things differently but what\u2019s done is done and ultimately the father didn\u2019t like being treated the way he treats others. \n\nHe needed the wake up call", "Basically--don't punish people for giving you the outcome that you *want*. No \"Oh, look who finally woke up on time!\" when your partner doesn't need to set three alarms anymore, no \"Wow, look at that, you actually did the dishes!\" or \"The shower doesn't have any hair in it, it's about time!\" or whatever. \"Thank you\" or \"thanks for sharing this with me\" is a lot more useful.", "Now is the time to watch UP again, followed by Toy Story 3 and then Big Fish to mix it up a bit....and wrap up the weekend with Coco", "To be honest, you just made me curious about UP. Make up to him and watch together the latest Pinocchio. That damn cartoon is such a tear-jerker, even the trailer alone.", "Well now you have an opportunity to show him how his mocking you feels with an adult conversation.\n\nJust make sure to ask if he's not on his period first.\n\nSource - an asshole.  But humor sometimes works if you lean into it.", "Yep. YTA. I had 4 miscarriages so the scene in the doctor\u2019s office kills me because it mirrored my own experience of loss. My sons don\u2019t know why I cry during that scene.", "The good news is, you can try to open thwt door back up again with a really vulnerable and heartfelt apology.", "Everyone in this thread is on drugs or something. OPs dad has been morning but an asshole.", "Fr don't dish shit you can't take", "People on this subreddit wouldn't understand the concept of de-escalation if its dictionary entry was written on a billboard in neon lights.", "Fair.  I conceded in another reply that \"ESH\" could have been a better verdict.", "Exactly.  If someone does something to you that makes them an asshole, doing the exact same thing back to them doesn't make you *not* an asshole -- though it *might* be a case of \"justified asshole\".\n\nI'm willing to concede that \"ESH\" would have been the better verdict, though.", "comment stolen from here", "The end of Coco, where Miguel sings to his abuela, is right up there with the opening of UP. They are gutwrenching and anyone who says otherwise can sit and spin.", "Oh god my mom and I watched Coco soon after my father died and we were both just sobbing. \n\nWatched it one more time with my boyfriend a couple.weeks later, haven't watched it since.", "Can\u2019t control what other people do. OP treated his dad in a way he did not like to be treated himself. OP can sink to that level or apologize and be better", "Because then he makes himself an asshole too? Bullying is an asshole move, even if its seemingly well deserved. Calling him out and saying his behavior was unacceptable,  and setting boundaries is an appropriate response. Going NC if he doesnt respect boundaries is an appropriate response. Sinking to that level is not.", "This was a very sweet conversation \ud83d\ude2d", "You know, my parents always said something like that when I tried to better myself and do something our of character. It actively put me off doing those things in the future because of the comments. I'll have to do better with my daughter.", "I never cried when I watched Coco. Then i got pregnant. Now it's a really heartwarming movie that makes me cry", "The first time I watched up, I was on a flight and was crying so hard that people were starting to look. I had to stop it and wait for some pizza to come out so I had something to partially distract me. It's a magnificent film.", "Tom Hanks or Guillermo del Toro?", "Omg that movie absolutely destroyed me. The last scene with the blue fairy wrecked me but I was like \u201cat least it\u2019s a happy ending.\u201d  Then they had to go and bury me with the ending. Probably one of my favourite animated films of all time.", "Why is the child teaching the parent how to be better? It\u2019s the father\u2019s job to model a healthy relationship with his son.", "OP is 100% right and you're just wrong. Stop defending the dad.", "Right? You are not entitled to empathy if you have shown none in your lifetime.", "And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.", "No worries. I just really hate this subreddit sometimes. It's clear that OP has had to suffer years under his dad's toxic masculinity and now we're all coddling his dad and OP is an asshole for striking back.", "I don't even want to imagine watching Coco soon after losing someone close!!!", "Have you seen Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio? A few people mentioned it above but it\u2019s a masterpiece. I cannot state enough that it will emotionally destroy you though. I\u2019m so sorry about your father.", "Being \"better\" never does anything but leave bad people without consequences.", "Sure go live in your magic world where being nice works", "20 years of pain, it\u2019s real hard not to dish that pain back.", "Having kids makes many movies hit different.", "I\u2019m not a emotional person but Up is one of the few movies that can make me cry. The one series I had a complete meltdown was A silent voice", "Agreed. I usually watch Guillermo del Torro for his creepy ass movies but this one? Like my friend said when he came out all teary faced from Coco, just magical.", "Fucking Guillermo del Toro. That man has done some seriously spooky movies and then this.", "My own dad taught me an expression that I feel is very relevant here: \"You're right, so what?\"\n\nWhat is more important to OP here, being able to \"win one\" over his jerk of a dad, or to do something that would actually tangibly improve his situation and how his dad treats him? I'd personally go with the second option.", "In my case, I was responding to the \"AITA\" question and focusing on OP's behavior, which sometimes makes me forget that when being an AH is at least even slightly justified, \"ESH\" is the better answer.  I likewise forget about \"NAH\" inappropriately sometimes.", "For sure. ESH, the dad has been up in OP's grill for 2 decades. He gets a little back and can't handle it. Not so fun to have your feelings/likes made fun of, is it, pops? Not so proud of teaching your son that kind of behavior is okay, are ya?", "It was NOT a good decision.  But that's what she wanted for mother's day! We went out for dinner and watched Coco. \n\nThen after my grandma died I picked a random Disney movie (UP) and put it on. The sobbing started again. \n\n\nI'm not a smart lady.\n\nEdit: when I picked UP I was thinking of the fun adventures. It wasn't until I realized Carl was all alone because his partner died that I started getting sad and thinking about my grandpa", "It's such a good movie.  My kid laughed at me for crying.  She's as bad as the OP!!\n\nShes 7 though.", "With Toy Story 3, realizing my kids will one day grow up and leave. Dang ninjas cutting onions, but in a good way"]}
