Be better.", "YTA and your pettiness probably shut the door on your Dad ever opening up in a meaningful way. It\u2019s a really recent phenomenon for men to be allowed any kind of emotional depth or expression. Was he an AH? Yes. This was a golden opportunity for you to model empathy and validate that emotions are okay. Instead you did what he and most men around the world have done forever, kicked him for being vulnerable. As younger adult men, we\u2019ve grown up in an era where we have been allowed a little bit more emotional freedom (at least socially).
