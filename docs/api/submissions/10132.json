You had the win. You showed your dad that animated films are amazing art when they are at their best.  And then you stooped to his level.  You did the toxic masculinity thing and mocked a man for showing emotions. That's your father and he had a breakthrough that you could have cherished and used as a bonding experience and you threw it away.  Be better.", "YTA and your pettiness probably shut the door on your Dad ever opening up in a meaningful way. It\u2019s a really recent phenomenon for men to be allowed any kind of emotional depth or expression. Was he an AH? Yes. This was a golden opportunity for you to model empathy and validate that emotions are okay. Instead you did what he and most men around the world have done forever, kicked him for being vulnerable. As younger adult men, we\u2019ve grown up in an era where we have been allowed a little bit more emotional freedom (at least socially). I pity older men and I think their emotional baggage is a massive part of society\u2019s ills.

Have a BRIEF talk about how words can hurt sometimes. Have a beer if that's yalls thing. Then, after an appropriate amount of time has passed, ask him if he would also like to cosplay as a girl with you sometime in the future. Remember, Comedy is all about the timing.", "YTA simply for making fun of someone when they\u2019re vulnerable. Also it\u2019s your Dad so he\u2019s probably relating it to something that either happened between your mom and him (infertility/miscarriage) or the fact that they are older and one will die before the other sooner or later. So yes YTA", "Yta", "I don't think you the AH, but I would think if you saw him actually crying I would have said nothing to him, just let him walk away and deal with it in his own mind, not ask if he needed a hanky. If a man that age starts to cry it's best to leave him alone about it. I hope you guys squared this away between yourselves.", "Eh, kind of. You could've hit a home run and convinced him that the medium was viable for adults\n\nInstead you put him into defensive mode. So congrats on shooting your own victory in the foot due to spite", "I have to go with \"YTA\" even if it was arguably justified.\n\nYou don't make fun of someone crying because of \"Up\".  Bits of that are emotionally *brutal*.", "ESH. Your point would have probably gone over better if you didn\u2019t sink to his level", "ESH.  Two wrongs don't make a right and all that.  He's an ass and you stooped to his level so now you're an ass too.", "ESH", "He said he understood now. What would've really worked in that was for you to kill him with kindness. Not to act the way he does. Because now you're both assholes.", "ESH, but with promise...\n\nYou and your dad have both behaved badly. If he says he is hurt because you mocked him for crying, it's your opportunity to tell him you are hurt by what he says. He actually modeled the bad behavior for you, and he needs to understand this. Your dad is pretty multi-layered, too. Why not take the opportunity to get to know him better?", "YTA. The theme of UP is not a childish one and you know full well that is \\*not\\* what he was crying over.   \nHobbies are not equal with emotions.", "ESH. Your dad has some toxic masculinity issues and he needs to change what he thinks it\u2019s manly and what isn\u2019t. But, you also making fun of him didn\u2019t help. It probably just reinforced that toxic masculinity. Side note- I also cry during UP.", "ESH. He has some toxic masculinity going on here but dang, you sure missed a useful teaching opportunity. This could have led to discussion rather that mockery. Just because he was an ass didn\u2019t mean you needed to be too. You could have been the bigger man rather than dropping to his level.", "He actually watched it with you, cried (as we all do to that movie), and then told you he understood why you watch them. What more did you need? \n\nIm sure your dad can be an ass in the way dads are asses, but i have to give you the tiniest YTA for this.", "ESH. You made your point, but the way you did it probably just helped to enforce your father\u2019s toxic masculinity.", "ESH. While I get why the Nelson Muntz moment felt good for a second, I think the chances of having this create change in him went out the window because you chose to sink to his level.", "ESH. And up is the most tear jerker movie ever! If you don't cry during up you don't have a soul", "YTA. You could've used to moment to bond over. It was a golden opportunity to show your side.

Quite immature imo.", "I think he deserved it, but I also think ESH", "It's funny how much we become like our parents, both the good parts and the bad", "YTA. I get he had been a dick yo you in the past, but that does not make it ok to do to him in return.", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t mock other people\u2019s emotions.\n\nThis is why men don\u2019t express themselves and end up depressed", "You can salvage it by apologizing to him. \u201cSorry I teased you about UP. I really enjoyed watching with you. Maybe we can watch xyz next\u201d", "I'm going to say NTA. Your dad deserved it. Maybe this experience will open his mind. You definitely didn't have to make fun of him, but i don't think it makes you an asshole for doing so in this situation. Don't dish it if you can't take it.", "Wouldn't it have a bit better to say gently, \"See Dad, it's not just me.\" ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "speaking as a widower YTA.  May you never have to experience grief.", "ESH! He shouldn't be making fun of you for collecting what you love, but you shouldn't be making fun of him for having deep feelings like he does. There is a difference here. He and your mom are thinking about losing each other eventually and you're upset about toys. How about you both stop mocking each other and respect each others likes, dislikes and feelings.", "NTA. Just another case of \u201cI can dish it out but can\u2019t handle it back\u201d on your dads part", "YATA. Don't like something done but do that same thing to others? Sounds healthy lol", "NTA. Normally I\u2019m not a fan of making fun of people for crying at something, but with the grief he\u2019s given you in the past this was well justified.", "I think NTA. But you could have approached it better. In general, I hate \"I told you so\", but maybe just saying something along the lines of \"see, they're not that bad eh?\".  Granted though, when you deal with toxicity for so long it can be very difficult to resist cracking a small joke back. Also it is clear that you don't think a man crying is bad; your dad does, so him getting pissed is more his problem than anyones.\n\nUP's opening  is a damn powerful scene though tbf", "NTA.

Maybe he'll stop being a sanctimonious bully now", "NTA (except you shouldn't have apologized). Turnabout is always fair play.", "NTA - well played.", "NTA he\u2019s bullied you for years, buy him a pack of hankies", "I mean, that was a dick move . . . but also, well played.
