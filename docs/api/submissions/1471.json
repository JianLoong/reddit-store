In fact, a few months ago we decided to take the next step and my husband and I decided he would get a vasectomy. We thought it was a good idea because that way we weren\u2019t placing the entire burden on me for our birth control. \n\nHowever, yesterday my husband and I were speaking and he casually dropped a weird bomb on me. His sister asked him if he\u2019d be willing to donate his sperm so she could have a baby with someone else\u2019s eggs.\n\nYeah. Right? \n\nMy sister in law and I have a friendly relationship. She and my husband are very close and I often think they cross a line when it comes to boundaries in our (my husband and my) relationship. My husband is someone who wants to please others, often helping neighbors and serving our community. \n\nOn the other hand, I understand why his sister would ask him for this favor, they are really close. Furthermore, my sister in law is unmarried and has been having fertility issues. But to me, once my husband and I made a decision, together, that was final. There\u2019s no guilting me into changing my mind. I don\u2019t want little versions of my husband walking around several years from now hanging around during Christmas and Thanksgiving. I cringe when I think about what that experience could bring, especially when I don\u2019t want to be part of this.\n\nMy husbands response? My body, my choice. I unequivocally said, \u201cNo fucking way,\u201d and ended the conversation there. My husband said he wants to think about it some more because it\u2019s something his sister really wants.

Eww wtf gross, no! \n\nNTA.", "YTA.  You have body autonomy and so does he.  You don't get to make unilateral decisions on what he can do to help his sister out.  Also, it wouldn't be his child, it would be hers.  She would be the one raising it.

I would ask for a divorce if he continued down this path. Nope, not for me.", "There is a reason brothers and sisters aren't allowed to marry.

I will never understand why people do this sort of thing. If you are having fertility issues, I am sympathetic, but dragging family into it for genetic, or even financial, contributions of any kind is a recipe for disasters and confused children. Don\u2019t need the drama. Of course, he absolutely can do whatever he likes with his body, but I would not be sticking around for the fallout. Good luck OP.", "YTA. Her eggs won't work, she wants a child, and that's her closest blood relative that can help. Also, he's correct in that it's his choice. It wouldn't be his child because biology does not a parent make. Neither one of you would have a kid, because he'd be your SIL's. \n\nAll the people saying that it's weird obviously never gone through the pain that your sister-in-law is suffering.\n\nNow of course if he thinks about it and says no and she insists, then she's the a-hole. If him providing genetic material is a deal breaker in the marriage, that's something for you and him to settle as a separate question or consult therapy or an attorney.", "YTA. His choice.

Or if this was a lesbian SIL, who's partner was conceiving?\n\nI don't think you're wrong, OR right.", "NTA.  This could create a very uncomfortable situation.  She may ask him for child support as well.  (It is his child, after all.) Don't even go there.", "NTA. Even though she would be using donor eggs, his sister would still be carrying and giving birth to her brother's baby. That\u2019s creepy.", "NTA, While I do agree with people having control over their own body's I do agree that when it comes to donating sperm or eggs that that is something both people in a relationship need to decide on together, and if one person is against it then that's a no.  I also would not be comfortable with my fiance having other children walking around even if he wasn't taking on the role of being their dad.  Would be even worse if they'd be around for holidays and what not.  I also get the feeling it wouldn't end at him just donating sperm. If what you say is true about their relationship crossing boundaries I would even go as far as to feel like he would actually take on the fathering role in these kids lives to \"help out his sister\" and honestly that'd be a really weird dynamic I wouldn't be able to get over. I would tell him straight up this is a deal breaker in your relationship if that's how you feel.", "YTA. I agree with him it\u2019s his body his choice. Nobody else should have control over whether or not he fathers children. Period. If you can\u2019t handle it, then maybe he\u2019s not the right person for you. Also, this is not a totally unheard of arrangement. The baby will have some of the mothers shared gene pool with her brother and there is no incestual mixing. Phoebe Buffe even helped her brother have babies, remember?", "NTA. You will end up being step mom to your niece/nephew who also happens to be your husband's bio kid.\n\nHe is right though. His body his choice. So if he goes through with that I only see separation in the future. That's what I would do", "You\u2019re the jerk.\n\nI understand where you\u2019re coming from, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s raising and child and starting a family with someone else. He\u2019s being a good brother and letting his sister have the opportunity to raise a child with her blood, since she is unable to herself. \n\nI know it feels weird in the moment, but in the grand scheme of things, you\u2019d be completely unreasonable and selfish to deny someone close to you the opportunity at happiness. \n\nAlso, his body his choice, right?", "NTA. This is weird AF. I get the sister wanting her kids to have some of the family genes but it\u2019s be a hell no from me as well.", "NTA! Your husband wants to father his sister's baby? Even if it is with another woman's egg, i find it very creepy and weird. You would have to see your husband's baby in every family gathering. And i assume he will pay child support? Be the father of his nephew? Weird!", "So that kid\u2019s dad would also be his own brother/uncle/dad? \n\nYikes. It\u2019s fair for you to set the boundary there. NTA.\n\nEdit: I mean legally not biologically. That\u2019s a disturbing setting for a child to deal with. What if your husband gets attached? You\u2019re opening yourself to essentially become a \u201cstep-mom\u201d while your husband and your sister raise a child.", "NTA\n\nThere's ZERO chance your husband wouldn't take a fatherly role in this child's life. Zero chance.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nDonor egg but she would be carrying the child?", "NTA. Even though the egg would be in no way linked to him, the fact his sister thinks it's not going to be an issue when a potential child asks who their father is, or, God forbid later on you and your husband find out he has a terrible genetic issue and the child has to be screened for it as well. Your sister inlaw is cuckoo if she doesn't see all the terrible things that could be said about HER child if it was to ever get out their father is their mother's brother", "NTA. This is disgusting and weird.\nI am wondering if they (your husband and his sister) are having an affair.", "Could she not go after him in the future for child support given that he knowingly gave her the sperm and it wasn't from a clinic?

How could he not be a huge part of his child\u2019s life???? Hey look! It\u2019s your Uncle-Daddy! \n\nFor me, this would be a dealbreaker. \n\nIf he\u2019s going to do this, I\u2019d be out. Like, you can give your sister your child, but I won\u2019t be around for it.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry about this situation. It\u2019s incredibly manipulative of his sister and CREEPY AF that he\u2019s even thinking about it.", "So, different opinion but, I agree with the husband. It is his body and he can do what he wants with it. You're completely within your rights to say that you aren't comfortable with that and leave the relationship.", "NTA\n\nI get the \u201ctechnically not incest\u201d part, and incest really refers to the act of having sex with a close relative.\n\nBut I can\u2019t get past the cringe factor either.", "NTA-she can use other people", "The sister is asking for her brothers sperm to be donated to be used with a different females eggs, not her own. Not incest. The sister would be theoretically be raising her nephew. Not her biological child.", "Reread.", "Would you let your partner impregnate their sibling or vice versa? Maybe not be direct incest but birthing your siblings is definitely not normal", "Next on Springer!", "She\u2019d be using someone else\u2019s eggs, but it would still be her brother\u2019s kid.", "Yeah. That\u2019s definitely an r/HolUp title, but given the details, it\u2019s definitely more of an issue of SIL wants a kid with her genes, and even if she were to have kids of her own, they could be a lot like OP\u2019s husband anyways. I feel like it\u2019s a reasonable request and that\u2019s coming from someone who was always open to adopting. NAH. Best of luck sorting it out.", "Maybe try reading it again.", "Surrogate is not the same as providing genetic material.", "Phoebe Buffay is not real", "What in the Alabama is this?", "What if his sister dies?", "Nope. They\u2019d be using an egg donor.", "Where are you getting that from? She wouldn\u2019t need to ask him to donate if they were already screwing, lol. \n\nChoosing to use a relative\u2019s egg/sperm because you are unable to conceive on your own is not innately disgusting or weird on it\u2019s own and it\u2019s extremely problematic to use that as an immediate excuse to jump to incest. Your assertion is disgusting and weird.", "Afaik private arrangements like this are not protected.  Eg she could go after him for child support if this isn\u2019t done just right", "This is what I thought too and I'm leaning to NAH as both are right in their opinions.", "Lol whoops my bad missed that part.  Maybe they aren't idiots.  But they are AH in my opinion.   Judgement remains NTA.", "Yeah until the kid finds out his biological dad is actually his uncle. And incest has already been ingrained in him as a hard no-no. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll handle it just fine. \n\nHopefully the bullies don\u2019t catch wind of it\u2026", "I\u2019m not saying biologically - I mean legally. This isn\u2019t a normal donor situation.\n\nThere needs to be a contract or she could sue for alimony. How involved does your husband want to be? What happens if the kid wants his dad and your husband agrees? He starts to co-parent with his sister and you\u2019re the stepmom?", "So the part where she says they are too close and often cross her boundaries\u2026 you just skimmed over that?", "Maybe they\u2019ll nickname him \u201cKingslayer\u201d."]}
