It's clearly not incest, and it's relatively common imo for siblings to donate DNA to their infertile/queer siblings so that their kids are related to them, and going off of this post I don't think this situation reasonably gives off ~incestuous~ vibes. For the parenting part, if this moves forward then all three of you sit and talk about your boundaries and expectations regarding the amount of responsibility you're willing to take (limits on babysitting, attending milestone events, etc.) and make a game plan for what and when the kid learns about his conception.\n\nThis may not be popular, but I vote NAH. You're within your right to feel what you're feeling, but I think you can approach this with a bit more compassion for your SIL, and your DH who obviously cares a lot about SIL. At the very least I think you all should have a long talk about everyone's feelings and consider the logistics above, and if y'all can't reach an agreement, then you don't move forward. I do think there isn't really anything wrong with SIL's idea honestly, so I encourage you to think deeper about why it upsets you--and maybe try couples counseling. \n\n(as a sidenote though i personally never understand going through all the work for IVF when there are SO many kids out there in need of parents and a home, but PLEASE don't push adoption/fostering on SIL since some people really need that physical experience i guess)", "Definitely NTA.

It's also yours to walk away from that crazy ish too.", "YTA. \n\nYou don't want children and have in effect coerced your husband to meet your wishes and have a vasectomy, which means if the relationship ends he has no chance of then having children either.

He could be a legal donor, so no issues relating to finances etc. But also discussing how they would share his identity at the time that she shared she had used donor eggs.\n\nThe child would be the SIL's child.

Will he then slowly start taking on a fatherhood role in that child's life, who would be his biological son? How involved is OP supposed to be throughout all this? It's just so messy. \n\nI think they need clear boundaries, some counselling, and a legal agreement so everyone is on the same page.

I can\u2019t imagine anyone being so obsessed with having biological children (and not even *your* biology!) that you\u2019d be willing to put your brother\u2019s sperm inside you.\nAfter spending so long thinking this was a thing that only existed in gross sibling incest fetish stuff (which was, unfortunately, rampant on anime forums when I was little), I\u2019m having trouble wrapping my head around the possible normalcy of it.
