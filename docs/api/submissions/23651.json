He's going to end up in HRs office if he does that. He doesn't want to listen, but thank you for trying to set him right.", "NTA\n\nWhat he's doing is so deeply inappropriate that it's literally a fireable offense at pretty much any job if HR catches wind of it. He shouldn't be in a managerial position, and he's WAY too young not to be aware of that. Worst of all, literally everything he thinks is a defense of his behaviour actually just makes it worse:\n\n>he stated that that's what he calls his coworkers because they're all \"good looking\".\n\nOkay, well that's Strike One. He should obviously know better than to be referring to his coworkers according to their appearance at all, much less how attractive he finds them. That's gross and full-on sexual harassment bait.\n\n>I said . . . that it felt inappropriate and disrespectful to say that about a coworker to which he stated that they were his subordinates.\n\n. . . First of all, a subordinate is still a coworker. I feel like he doesn't know what words mean. But secondly, this is definitely Strike Two, because the fact that he has authority over them just makes it that much worse for him to be discussing their looks or calling them by inappropriate nicknames that reference his attraction to them.\n\n>he says I'm assuming offense for his coworkers\n\nNo you're not. And it doesn't matter if they're offended or not. Again, he doesn't understand how anything works. It doesn't matter if they find it offensive or not, it's OBJECTIVELY INAPPROPRIATE behaviour on his part. He's an authority figure, and they wouldn't be in a position to object to his calling them that or to say whether they were offended anyway, because he could fire them. Moreover, even if they weren't offended, it's still deeply unprofessional.\n\n>and that he would not call them cuteys in front of them or anything.\n\n. . . Which just makes it worse, because it establishes that he is aware that what he's saying is super inappropriate. If it weren't, he wouldn't be afraid to say it in front of them. Like, dude, if you can't say it to your colleagues faces, you shouldn't be saying it about them at all. SMH.\n\nYou are NTA. This guy is gross, incredibly unprofessional, and should be reported to his company for creating a hostile work environment.", "NTA that is disrespectful and hostile.", "NTA that\u2019s very weird behaviour", "NTA - Gross. I could maybe excuse this for an extremely old person. But not a 34 year old. Ick.", "NTA. It *is* gross. He can find them attractive, but it's a different level when he's decided to give them a nickname.", "NTA - Thank you for stepping up where you did!  it is NEVER appropriate to refer to your subordinates in such a way either in person or behind their backs.  They are your subordinate which already gives you some level of power over them. They have names, your friend should be using them. \n\nYour friend is SOOOOOO far out of line! Being called those child like names by someone who I am not personally close with and have asked men in the work place to cut it out multiple times.  \n\nThis could also be fast-tracking your friend to an HR complaint and being fired, depending on how seriously complaints like this are taken at his place of work.  It is one thing to say \"oh my coworker Judy was telling me a story at work about XYZ...\" outside of work ours, that is fairly normal.  When you phrase it as \"Oh I had this cutey at work help with with the ABC project\"  sounds possessive, creepy, and if I knew about it, I wouldn't feel safe in my workplace alone with him.", "NTA. You're absolutely right that this is unprofessional and inappropriate. The fact that they haven't expressed discomfort doesn't mean that they don't feel it, and you're absolutely right to call it out.", "NTA and it's great you called them out on it. Please keep calling out this kind of behavior in your friend and others", "NTA\n\nDo you also have to explain to him not to grab them on the ass or tell them to smile?\n\nGood grief.", "NTA.

As a young woman, if my manager whom I had no relationship with at all (so it couldn\u2019t be a friendly greeting or anything) called me cutie at work I would be wildly uncomfortable. \n\nIf I found out they were doing it outside of work I think I\u2019d be even more pissed.

I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s saying it to their faces or not. The attitude is creepy and disrespectful and will land him in hot water with HR because sooner or later he\u2019ll likely slip up or just feel comfortable saying it to their faces.

I don\u2019t know if they think it\u2019s charming or suave but in reality, it squicks most women out. At the same time, these are his coworkers and they deserve to be referred to with respect.", "I'm not calling my coworkers cutie, I'm calling my subordinates cutie.\nInsert the Good Place \"but that's worse meme\"", "NTA you're completely right. Even if he doesn't call them that to their faces, it is gross. He should not be thinking of them as cute, especially as he is their manager.", "NTA. The fact that his response was that they\u2019re his \u201csubordinates\u201d and not his coworkers told me everything I needed to know.

Someone being a subordinate doesn't mean you can call them whatever you want, whether it's to their faces or not. Chances are those other employees think he's a massive creep.", "NTA. He is gross and ewwwwww!", "NTA. That's entirely inappropriate. My BIL calls kids \"cutie\" a lot, and we have to basically scold him every time.", "NTA.\n\n> he would not call them cuteys in front of them or anything\n\nSo he's just being patronising and disrespectful behind their backs then, that's even worse. \n\nHe is going to slip, one of them is going to catch on and he is going to lose his job.
