He shouldn't be in a managerial position, and he's WAY too young not to be aware of that. Worst of all, literally everything he thinks is a defense of his behaviour actually just makes it worse:\n\n>he stated that that's what he calls his coworkers because they're all \"good looking\".\n\nOkay, well that's Strike One. He should obviously know better than to be referring to his coworkers according to their appearance at all, much less how attractive he finds them. That's gross and full-on sexual harassment bait.\n\n>I said . . . that it felt inappropriate and disrespectful to say that about a coworker to which he stated that they were his subordinates.\n\n. . . First of all, a subordinate is still a coworker. I feel like he doesn't know what words mean. But secondly, this is definitely Strike Two, because the fact that he has authority over them just makes it that much worse for him to be discussing their looks or calling them by inappropriate nicknames that reference his attraction to them.\n\n>he says I'm assuming offense for his coworkers\n\nNo you're not. And it doesn't matter if they're offended or not. Again, he doesn't understand how anything works. It doesn't matter if they find it offensive or not, it's OBJECTIVELY INAPPROPRIATE behaviour on his part. He's an authority figure, and they wouldn't be in a position to object to his calling them that or to say whether they were offended anyway, because he could fire them. Moreover, even if they weren't offended, it's still deeply unprofessional.\n\n>and that he would not call them cuteys in front of them or anything.\n\n. . . Which just makes it worse, because it establishes that he is aware that what he's saying is super inappropriate. If it weren't, he wouldn't be afraid to say it in front of them.

It is one thing to say \"oh my coworker Judy was telling me a story at work about XYZ...\" outside of work ours, that is fairly normal.

So yea, I think a lot of \u2018attractive\u2019 working women get a bit more than their fair share of unwanted attention and dismissiveness of their abilities. However, I do think most women are fighting an uphill battle with this regardless. We are not just Ms Jane Doe, the colleague. I may have had a different struggle because I got a STEM degree in the early 1980s.", ">Sometimes part of being a good friend \n\nWhy are you good friends with a sexist fucker who likes to objectifiy his coworkers?

Youre better off not being friends with someone like that", "Whoooooo Doggy, NTA at alllllll! He is looking to get the shit can at best and a sexual harassment lawsuit at worst, I mean can they also press charges if he is creepy as fek?

Your friend is being inappropriate and he knows it. That\u2019s why the conversation got heated. He didn\u2019t expect to be called out for his bad behavior. Especially not by another guy.", "NTA. If he takes your advice you've saved him from getting fired for sexual harassment and protected women who had to deal with his creepiness", "You're absolutely right, and them being his subordinates makes it worse. This is extremely inappropriate and I would be worried about him potentially crossing the line at work in other ways with these employees.", "NTA\nIf he actually thought it was okay he wouldn't be saying he wouldn't be calling them cuties in front of them. He knows it's not okay.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure his subordinates are at least slightly if not extremely uncomfortable. He should be glad HR hasn\u2019t caught wind of it.", ">...he would not call them cuteys in front of them or anything.\"\n\nBecause deeply disturbing and blatantly illegal behavior *totally* becomes acceptable when you're only willing to do it behind your victim's back, right?\n\nNTA, and I'd honestly pass that shit on to whomever his supervisor is.

I had to correct someone in their 50s who referred to the secretaries at work as \"the girls\" but that's a whole other generation. Just ew.", "NTA and if that's how he's talking about them around you, there's no way he's being 100% respectful and non-sexually-harrassing around them even if he doesn't call them that to their face", "NAH\n\nIf I understand your post correctly, he is not \"calling\" them cutey. He is referring to them as cuteys. Ridiculous spelling aside, there's. Othing wrong with that. Maybe they are cute. He owes them respectful treatment in the workplace. This has nothing to do with that. \n\nBut if you want to tell him to stop, go for it. You're entitled to your opinion.", "NTA If my older adult male boss called me cutie I\u2019d be marching straight to HR, that is wildly inappropriate and tbh I wonder if his subordinates don\u2019t feel comfortable speaking out against their boss to tell him to stop", "NTA it is absolutely 100% inappropriate. Tell your friend he is opening himself and the company to law suites. Also it's just gross to have your boss talk about you like that", "NTA, and let him know that his coworkers definitely make fun of this to each other behind his back because it's super weird", "NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is the embodiment of workplace cringe. Ew.", "NTA.  My work might give such a person a warning before terminating their job.  But probably not.", "NTA.

NTA. Your friend needs to evaluate his mindset.", "He will not be in a mangers role long.  And if he is actually singling out attractive specifically to work with him alone, he is going to get fired and sued", "NTA even if he wasn\u2019t saying it to their faces and only to you - that\u2019s super cringe.", "NTA\n\nAcceptable circumstances to call a co-worker \"cutie\": their initials are Q.T.\n\nThat is **all**.", "NTA he's 34 he knows better. He'll end up in a lawsuit", "NTA. Sounds like he is abad Boss. This will get him in trouble when it comes out.", "NTA at all, that's wildly inappropriate. If anything, the fact that he's only doing it behind their backs is creepier. If he was doing it to their face...I certainly wouldn't like it, but I don't know him, or them, or what their work culture is like, maybe there is a world where they're ok with that, or at least he's so out of touch it's an innocent mistake.

No way to get in trouble with that.", "The fact that they\u2019re his subordinates makes it worse, not better. NTA", "NTA from just the title wtaf", "NTA  but you friend is. And this is why. \n\n>he stated that that's what he calls his coworkers because they're all \"good looking\".\n\nSo they are just interchangeable cuteys.
