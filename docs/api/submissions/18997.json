We have been together for a few years and have been trying to work out details for moving in together. I usually spend a few nights a week at her place and have my own place for when I have work. Since her kids are not mine, I\u2019m always hesitant to tell them what they can/cannot do. My gf has told me to treat her kids as if they were mine and that I can tell them what to do if needed. Despite that, I rarely tell her kids to do anything except for \u201cno snacking before dinner,\u201d \u201clisten to your mother,\u201d and for them to clean up after themselves (candy wrappers, empty water bottles, etc).\n \nOne day a few months ago, I was walking in the house with groceries. Her teenage daughter \u201cSam\u201d (14)(fake name) is chilling in the kitchen wearing only a bra and short shorts. I told her, \u201cSam, put a shirt on.\u201d She became extremely upset and stormed off to her room. To be fair, I didn\u2019t say \u201cplease put a shirt on\u201d but I also didn\u2019t yell; my tone was just tired from running errands and bringing in groceries.\n \nMy gf explained that her kids are used to walking around the house half-naked and told me that I must\u2019ve been raised \u201cmore conservatively.\u201d I told her that I wasn\u2019t going to ask anything of the kids that I wouldn\u2019t do myself; on nights when I\u2019m sleeping over and need something from the kitchen, I put a shirt/shorts on before leaving her room. She started bringing up, \u201cwell what about if we go to the beach or to the pool, she\u2019s wearing a swimsuit.\u201d I said I think that a swimsuit is different than just wearing a bra since everyone is in swimsuits at the beach/pool, they\u2019re not just hanging out half naked in the common areas of the house (kitchen, living room, etc). We both left it at that since nothing became of it.\n \nOne day my gf and her kids were going to the beach and \u201cSam\u201d stated \u201cdon\u2019t invite OP.\u201d When she asked why, \u201cSam\u201d stated that \u201cI think OP stares at my boobs.\u201d When she told me this, I was taken aback since I\u2019m the person who isn\u2019t cool with her kids walking around the house half naked. My gf told me that \u201cbecause you made a big deal about the shirt, \u201cSam\u201d thinks you\u2019re staring at her.\u201d\n \nIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me and I\u2019m not sure how to de-escalate the situation. I\u2019ve only told Sam to put a shirt on once. This has never been an issue with the other kids. Trying to talk to her about this is impossible; since before even telling her to put a shirt on, she\u2019s never wanted to engage me. I\u2019ve tried starting conversations with her before in passing but she cold-shoulders me and acts like she didn\u2019t hear me. I try not to take offense and I haven\u2019t called her out on ignoring me since she\u2019s kind of just at that age when teens can be a bit moody or angry. The only time she talks to me is when she wants a ride to the store or to a friend\u2019s house. Aside from that, she doesn\u2019t speak to me.\n \nAITA for telling my GF\u2019s daughter to put a shirt on?", "created_utc": 1685927425, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140x7vz/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriends_teenage_daughter/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You made it weird by commenting on her outfit/body", "NTA\n\nEvery time a post similar to this pops up, people come in hoards calling OP a pervert with \"if this were a boy...\" This is the dumbest shit I've ever heard. I am a girl. I would never be around my brothers, dad, stepdad, or strangers in a bra. And before someone brings up the argument, \"how is a bra different than a bikini.\" It is. Just like how boxers and boxer briefs are different from swimming trunks. That is a pointless argument. Underwear is just an inherently intimate item, hence why they are called \"intimates.\"\n\nI don't want to see a kid in underwear regardless of the child's gender. I also don't want to see adults in their underwear. If it makes OP uncomfortable, it makes him uncomfortable. While you probably could have talked to your girlfriend about it first, OP, I don't see how an offhand comment makes you an AH.\n\nIf anyone is the AH, it is the 14 year old girl who makes wildly serious allegations out of spite. And I say it's spite because if she were truly uncomfortable, she wouldn't be asking you to drive her to her friends' houses or to the store.", "NTA Do not be alone with this child. She is trying to make a mountain out of a mole hill about the shirt. If she doesn't engage you any other time, don't be so quick to answer her request.", "Yta 1- it's not your house 2- her *parent* is okay with it 3- if you look at *anyone* and feel some sort of way, it is up to YOU to handle yourself. Not the other person.", "INFO: What's wrong with kids being shirtless in their own house when there aren't guests over?", "NTA - being dressed in the common areas of a house is a pretty reasonable expectation. Especially when you've got a blended family. Teaching a teen how to present themselves in mixed company is just part of raising a teenager.", "YTA Strike 1: Not your kids. Strike 2: Not your place (!). Strike 3: Not even any real difference between a bra vs a bikini top aside from the latter handling water better. You can behave yourself on a public beach right?\n\nIt takes balls, and not the good kind, to go to someone's house and TELL one of the people living there what to wear.", "YTA - You went into her house and sexualized her for wearing clothing that\u2019s totally acceptable at the beach or pool. \n\nOf course she thinks you were checking out her boobs - you were. You just made someone uncomfortable in their own home because you were uncomfortable. \n\nMy advice is to apologize to your gf and tell her you want to mend fences and ask how. I think this should be a mediated conversation with her daughter. \n\nIf I were you, my apology would sound something like: \u201cSam, I\u2019m really sorry I made you feel uncomfortable about what you were wearing in the house. It\u2019s your house and your choice what you wear, and I overstepped my boundaries. I realize I did this due to my own insecurities, and the last thing I wanted was to project that on you.

So you go into this child's home and tell her what to wear in front of her mother who clearly had no issue with her daughter's clothing? Yes, YTA and I suggest you apologize to this girl and your girlfriend before you even consider moving in with them.", "This has been posted before almost word for word. It\u2019s YTA ever time.

You say you don\u2019t typically \u201cparent\u201d them much so this was probably unexpected coming from you, plus women and girls are often told to cover up as not to distract and are sexualized for the clothes they wear. This probably made her feel like you were looking at her differently *aka* *sexually* because of the unexpected reaction. \n\nIf you plan on being around long term then I think you should talk with her and gf together and apologize for the comment and explain that you maybe grew up in a more conservative household and are not used to people lounging around in the kitchen/living area dressed that way. Tell her that you didn\u2019t mean to make her feel uncomfortable and you most definitely were not looking at her inappropriately as well as acknowledge that you\u2019ve come into their home and want to respect the norms they\u2019ve already set. Maybe try to build more of a relationship with the kids before you parent them regardless of what your girlfriend says as well.", "YTA. If she\u2019s not \u201chalf naked\u201d in a swim suit or sports bra, then she\u2019s not half naked in a bra.

Don't police what someone is wearing in their own home. Girls are sexualized enough.", "YTA- If Sam were a boy, would you have said the same thing? If the answer is no, consider that you are viewing her in a sexist and sexualized manner.  It would be different if she were totally topless, but, as she pointed out, you would have seen more at the beach. She isn't being difficult by not wanting you at the beach with her, she is creeped out by you. She feels unsafe.  \nEdited for grammar.", "YTA - body shaming a teenage girl is very different from reminding them to do their homework or chores. \n\nIf you are serious about becoming a part of this family, then I think that you need to find a way to have a mediated conversation with Sam. Family counseling to give her a chance to talk to someone about why she doesn't like you and to defuse these toxic interactions. \n\nIf you let this get out of hand, it can blow up your relationship.", "YTA. It's not your house, you really have no right to dictate. If it made you uncomfortable, you could have told your gf about it, and ask her how to approach it with her daughter. It's not really your place.", "Yta once you've sexualized a child once you can't go back after they know they're not safe to be a kid around you. She's firmly a teenager who is conscious of your gender roles.", "YTA - You were going fine with not telling her kids what to do. Even when you first told the girl to put on a shirt.\n\nBut as soon as you pushed back against Mom's decision that bras = bikini tops, then you started over-stepping from mom's bf to parent.", "Why are you sexualizing your girlfriend's daughter in the first place? That is really gross af.\n\nYTA", "NTA\n\nbut you need to tread lightly here\n\neven though your gf explicitly told you to act like a parent, doesn't mean you should take her up on that. Especially on something as tricky as nudity/modesty of teenage girls. As you already noticed Sam will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat and you got nothing to win here and everything to lose", "Wow, since times have changed and it's OK, I'm gonna wear nothing but a bra and underwear to Walmart.   OP is NTA", "NTA - Probably a generational thing as my opinion is different from most here.  I really don't see the link between asking someone to cover up and sexualizing them, and certainly not body shaming.  Seems more like projection to me.", "[deleted]", "NTA. I do not understand the AH judgements. If you get accused falsely of sexual abuse it can RUIN your life. Setting clear boundaries with minors is the way to make sure things stay appropriate, if they don\u2019t respect that, I\u2019d break it off.", "YTA - it's not your house, and obviously your gf didn't really mean, \"My kids are your kids\". You stepped in it, I'd step back. Apologize to your GF, if you need to, and tell her you're going to step back and ignore the 14 year olds behavior because it's her responsibility, not yours, and yes you \\*were\\* raised differently. Do not apologize to the 14 year old, she's just a kid and that will come back to haunt you, I believe. She's already trying to blow the issue up, so just ignore her the same way she's ignoring you, she'll come around (eventually).\n\nAs an aside, just because I say you are T A, it doesn't mean you're necessarily wrong. I imagined you were a boyfriend of a woman, and her teenage daughter was running around half naked. She should learn some constraints, for her own good -- just not from you at this stage in the relationship.", "YTA, why are sexualizing a 14 year old?", "YTA\n\nWhile you state that the two of you never had a close relationship, she obviously felt comfortable enough around you to simply be herself in her own home. She was relaxing the way she normally does in her own home.\n\nBy essentially telling her that what she was wearing was inappropriate by saying \u2018put on a shirt\u2019 she no longer sees you as somebody safe. She sees you as somebody who looked at her, and told her she had to cover up. In general, men tell girls to cover up because they\u2019re sexualizing them and think that them being comfortable in whatever they\u2019re wearing inappropriate to other peoples gaze. \n\nOf course she doesn\u2019t want you to be near her in a bathing suit since she\u2019s probably thinking \u2018great, he\u2019s going to be \u201clooking\u201d at me again with judgement\u2019 or \u2018great, he\u2019s looking at my boobs again\u2019. Something that was clearly not a concern before you told her to cover up. \n\nI know that your girlfriend told you to treat them like your own kids, but I can only assume that she meant that from a general perspective. I.e., don\u2019t let them play with matches or climb on the roof or drink alcohol under age. From the conversation you had with her, she clearly didn\u2019t mean for you to police her own daughter\u2019s clothing in her own home.", "YTA for policing what she wears in her own home for comfort. It is literally no different than a swimming suit so you are dead wrong here. She\u2019s an AH for saying she thinks you stare at her boobs just from this comment. Unless you do and that\u2019s why you want her to put a shirt on.", "Ok so sometimes teenage girls do this. They make a big deal out of nothing and make comments about someone else being sexually inappropriate, I am in no way discrediting teens since some older men are really inappropriate however in this particular instance it doesn\u2019t sound like you were. I had friends in high school who did this all time, said guys were looking at them like perverts when they weren\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if it made my friends feel good to say this stuff or not but whatever. \n\nBe careful here. Do not spend anymore nights at their house until this matter is somehow resolved. Do not put yourself in a situation where there may be allegations made about you.", "It\u2019s her own home. If her family has no problem with it, she shouldn\u2019t have to change. I can\u2019t speak to her coldness beforehand but I don\u2019t blame her for being uncomfortable around you. While you may not have sexualized her person, you sexualized her action of not wearing a shirt.\n\nYTA", "YTA she is in her own home there is nothing wrong with wearing a sports bra or bra and shorts. Also why did you have to say that her shorts wear short.", "YTA. That\u2019s not your daughter, and you have no place to infer that she can\u2019t feel safe in a bra in her own home.

It happens more often than you would think", "ESH (not teen daughter) OP and GF especially. \n\nOP, you lightly suck because she was not \u201chalf naked\u201d. She was clothed, full stop. As noted, if her attire was made of lycra and colorful, it would be a higher coverage bathing suit. At a volleyball practice it would be utterly fine. But honestly, we are not living in a vacuum, and a man being in a room with an underwear clad teen is going to be uncomfortable. That is valid. But this is her home. Think of her perspective- the dude my mom has sex with thinks he can show up a coupla days a week and tell me what to do in my home? Eff him. \n\nGF sucks because she is not being sensitive to how it feels for her kids to have a man in their space now, is now Sam\u2019s mouthpiece, as if SHE (gf) is not the cause of all of this.\n\nThere is no healthy communication here. You are being asked a lot of, and so is Sam. Your GF needs to be the facilitator, as she is the common thread. You need to all sit down and discuss how sharing space is going to happen, what is necessary for everyone to feel comfortable. But most of all you must remember this is this this child\u2019s home. You are an interloper and a guest. \n\nGood luck. These are difficult seas to navigate, and frankly your GF\u2019s actions are concerning to me.
