Yeah, you probably should have said something like, \"it'll probably be a bunch of guys\" or similar. I also understand why she was uncomfortable, but don't think that she really has cause to be majorly pissed about it. These things happen.", "NAH\n\nThis is a life learning experience.

And with people she doesn't? \nHow are you so blind to this? And guess what? If something did happen, the first question from the public and court  would be 'why did you go to a house when you barely knew the guy and was the only woman there?' \nWomen are on the lookout EVERYWHERE in our lives. \nDo some research and then explain that you didn't understand, apologize for placing her in a potentially dangerous situation and that it won't happen again.", "As a woman who is very uncomfortable around men who are not my husband or related to me I am going to say NTA.\n\nBecause when I meet someone, work with someone, I don't go around telling them about my past traumas and what causes me to be uncomfortable being around men. Especially by myself.\n\nSo therefore if I am invited to something I ask who all will be there. Because it is my responsibility to make sure I am not putting myself into a situation that I would be uncomfortable with. Because I don't go around broadcasting my traumas. So therefore who ever asked me does not know what I am uncomfortable with, and more than likely has never experienced the feelings I have, so they do not know to ask if I would be ok being the only woman in the group.\n\nIt's great if people are considerate enough to ask, but I know from experience that not everyone thinks of these things, because they have never experienced it. So the blame lays solely on the person with the issue. If they didn't ask, then it is their fault. People can't expect everyone to always know or just assume these types of things. You are responsible for making it known what makes you uncomfortable before hand instead of just assuming that everyone is going to know or think about it for you.", "Nta- but as a woman, I can relate to what she is saying. As men, you don't have the same need to be hyper-vigalent about your surroundings. She may have had a bad experience that left her uneasy being surrounded by men.which is not your fault. It's not a necessity for you to disclose this, as a woman, it would be appreciated to know it ahead 0f time.", "NTA. But you should of told her.  Women have had it drilled into us... never let yourself be alone in a house with men you don't know.  From the moment she got there to the moment she left... she was extremely uncomfortable, wondering if she was in danger.  My heart is beating fast just thinking about being in her position.  I'm only telling you this so you understand her side. It's not your fault or your friends or hers! Women have to be more careful, everyday this can be scary to us. We ask you for understanding... you want all guests in your house to be comfortable, definitely take it as a lesson and apologize to your coworker.", "Eh, gentle ESH. It was on you to make the situation clear and to be aware of how uncomfortable women can be around men (because of *gestures at widespread violence against women*), and it was on her to ask as well. Just a basic lack of communication. I think a coffee walk and a sincere apology will help sort it out.", "INFO: What was the game, and how big was the gathering? \n\nTrying to gauge what her expectations might have been based on what she was invited to. Like if someone invited me over to play something like Cards Against Humanity, I would expect maybe more men than woman since I\u2019m being invited by a man, but it\u2019s not necessarily a man-leaning game. If a guy invited me over to play Madden or DND, I would expect mostly if not all men (not that women can\u2019t or don\u2019t play these games, but more men do than women). For size of the group, I think it\u2019s more about how potentially uncomfortable the situation was. Personally I wouldn\u2019t feel very uncomfortable if it was like me, the guy I knew, and two other guys, but if it was a group of like 8 guys and me I might start to feel out of place and like it wouldn\u2019t be noticed as easily if one of them was being weird towards me. \n\nEven with all that, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole. But now that you know, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to consider it in the future. Whether she is an asshole I think depends on the situation. If she really is that bothered by being the only woman and knew it was a very male-leaning game, I think she should have taken it upon herself to ask. But if it was a \u201cgender neutral\u201d game and ended up being a large group, she might not have realized the situation would feel uncomfortable until she got there (but I still don\u2019t think she should be angry towards you if that\u2019s the case).", "NAH\n\nI\u2019ve been in groups where only one woman was present. I\u2019ve also been the only guy with several woman. Sometimes the groups can be fine. Sometimes the odd one out get sexually harassed. In my experience women have been more aggressive when I\u2019m the only guy. But she may have similar experiences. I\u2019m with you, if it\u2019s something she worries about she needs to check with the host. If you had no reason to believe she would be at risk with your group why would you think to inform her?", "Loosely NAH. But here's what I hope you'll take from this:\n\nFor whatever reason, your co-worker didn't ask ahead of time about the gender breakdown of your game. I don't know why, but she was absolutely understandably uncomfortable when she got there and made what she felt was the best decision for herself. Based on your life experience, you couldn't have really foreseen that you would have done well to tell her that it was going to be all men.\n\nBut now you know. My hope for you is that you'll apologize to her sincerely. You didn't intend to put her into a situation where she was uncomfortable, but someone felt uncomfortable in your home. I would hope that you feel a little bit bad about that, even if you didn't know you could take steps to prevent it.\n\nGoing forward, I hope you do mention to people who may be vulnerable that they will be the only ones like themselves there. I have absolutely as a white woman given friends of color. A heads up if everyone else involved in an activity was also white. My white friends are kind good people and I'm comfortable at this point in my life about vouching for them, but I don't expect a POC to just *know* that and I want them to be able to give informed consent. Now that you know something many women have to deal with, I hope you use the information.", "ESH - its a safety thing. Woman are assulted or worse every day all over the world in countless different situations. Im not suprised she was uncomfortable being in a house will unfamiliar men. \n\nIts something you, as a man and a decent human being, shold be aware. However, she should have also asked who would also being going if she had safety concerns. So both of you missed the boat and made an uncomfortable situation.", "NAH\n\nI mean if it was me I would have 100% told her she would be the only woman. As A male with a large mixed gender friend group this is honestly pretty common curtesy. But also if that would be a deal breaker to her its her responsibility to ask herself", "NTA. \n\nIf she has concerns, she needs to list them. \n\nIf she's allergic to pets or food items, you can't magically know that.

That didn't occur to you because you haven't experienced it but just bear it in mind for the future. Women have to navigate the world differently to men in order to stay safe.

Her trauma is not your responsibility. And I say this as someone with significant trauma caused by men. I never put myself in situations I feel uncomfortable with. I ask questions. I do my research. Co-worker should have just made an excuse and left, without going on a rant. \n\nNTA.", "NTA she should've asked then", "NTA. I almost went N A H since it seems like an easy misunderstanding, but I think her response the next day was a little much. I understand why she might have safety concerns or be uncomfortable, but it makes sense for a man not to think about that because, well, they never have to. It\u2019s \u201ccommon sense\u201d that women are at greater risk of violence by men, but that doesn\u2019t automatically translate to it being \u201ccommon sense\u201d for others to warn them about every scenario that they may feel at risk in. \n\nNot only that but context matters. You invited her over for a game at your house. For one, she probably wouldn\u2019t go if she didn\u2019t at least feel comfortable with you (and by extension, it\u2019s reasonable to assume if you\u2019re safe then you\u2019d make sure others are while there). But more pertinently, as a girl with mostly guy friends who enjoys both hobby games and video games, I expect most gatherings for such to be male-dominated - and if another girl is there, they may even feel insulted if someone suggested they might be uncomfortable by it since there\u2019s an implication there that girls can\u2019t handle gaming/gaming environments.", "NTA. I disagree with the other commenters so far. I think she overreacted. I understand if she felt uncomfortable and wanted to leave, that's totally her right. But it's not on you to explain who is going to be at your place when you invite someone for a gathering. And I don't think she should have scolded you for it. I'm a woman, btw, if that makes any difference.", "Personally I would have said NTA, but I work in a male dominated field, so I may be biased.", "NTA\n\nBut tuck this into your understanding that women have a lot of reasons not to feel safe in room full of men we don\u2019t know.", "NTA-  You, a man informed her your friends would be playing a game together.  Any reasonable person would know that means mostly or entirely men will be there.  She could have asked if she had any concerns over who would be there otherwise it's a matter of trust that your friends will be fine to be around.  Your right that her response is atypical.

The only exception is if you knew she had been assaulted by men in the past. Because of my social interests and my work field, I often end up at the only women.

I came to this post expecting to side with OP's colleague but the context makes it different. If a male colleague told me \"I'm having 2 friends over to play Ark Nova\" or whatever, I wouldn't be surprised if they all turned out to be men too. Statistically, it's fairly likely, due to the limited number of guests, the fact OP is a man himself, and the hobby in question. \n\nIt's just not reasonable to *assume* that out of only 2/3 guests, one has to be a woman, so the table would be at least 2 women-2 men.\n\nFWIW, I am a woman who is into boardgaming and in either of their shoes, I wouldn't have thought a warning was necessary.\n\nETA: I'm getting downvotes but that's absolutely been my experience. When I've joined larger meet-up, there has always been several women. At smaller gathering (5 or less people), it's been a mixed bag and has run almost the full gamut from all men to a majority of women.

And I'm not immediately distrusting of every man I meet.\n\nBut she was socializing with OP for the first time ever. She was not in a public place and every other man there was a stranger. The shitty thing is that women are way more likely to be harmed by people who are friends who who they have connections to, not a stranger in an alley. So being wary is not illogical.\n\nAlso, we have no insight from OP as to what the atmosphere at the gathering was. OP's friend did stay for a few rounds of the game, and it certainly may have been behavior or words of the men she was with that encouraged her to leave.", "You trust friends and family not strangers and OP's friends are strangers to her.", "She knew one man, everyone else was a stranger.

There's one. But how many guys raped or assaulted a woman THAT DAY?

I blatantly said rape and assault happen more often. YOU implied that that false accusations only happen when a man puts himself in a situation where he has to worry about an unhinged woman. I'm pointing out that that is victim blaming. A guy isn't asking to be falsely accused just by being around the wrong woman just as a woman isn't asking to be assaulted just by being around the wrong man. \n\nOn a pure numbers level, women are assaulted more than men are falsely accused. On the individual level both acts are reprehensible, albeit for different reasons."]}
