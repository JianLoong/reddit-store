Yeah, you probably should have said something like, \"it'll probably be a bunch of guys\" or similar. I also understand why she was uncomfortable, but don't think that she really has cause to be majorly pissed about it. These things happen.", "NAH\n\nThis is a life learning experience.

And with people she doesn't? \nHow are you so blind to this? And guess what? If something did happen, the first question from the public and court  would be 'why did you go to a house when you barely knew the guy and was the only woman there?' \nWomen are on the lookout EVERYWHERE in our lives. \nDo some research and then explain that you didn't understand, apologize for placing her in a potentially dangerous situation and that it won't happen again.", "As a woman who is very uncomfortable around men who are not my husband or related to me I am going to say NTA.\n\nBecause when I meet someone, work with someone, I don't go around telling them about my past traumas and what causes me to be uncomfortable being around men. Especially by myself.\n\nSo therefore if I am invited to something I ask who all will be there. Because it is my responsibility to make sure I am not putting myself into a situation that I would be uncomfortable with. Because I don't go around broadcasting my traumas. So therefore who ever asked me does not know what I am uncomfortable with, and more than likely has never experienced the feelings I have, so they do not know to ask if I would be ok being the only woman in the group.\n\nIt's great if people are considerate enough to ask, but I know from experience that not everyone thinks of these things, because they have never experienced it. So the blame lays solely on the person with the issue. If they didn't ask, then it is their fault. People can't expect everyone to always know or just assume these types of things. You are responsible for making it known what makes you uncomfortable before hand instead of just assuming that everyone is going to know or think about it for you.", "Nta- but as a woman, I can relate to what she is saying. As men, you don't have the same need to be hyper-vigalent about your surroundings. She may have had a bad experience that left her uneasy being surrounded by men.which is not your fault. It's not a necessity for you to disclose this, as a woman, it would be appreciated to know it ahead 0f time.", "NTA. But you should of told her.  Women have had it drilled into us... never let yourself be alone in a house with men you don't know.  From the moment she got there to the moment she left... she was extremely uncomfortable, wondering if she was in danger.  My heart is beating fast just thinking about being in her position.  I'm only telling you this so you understand her side. It's not your fault or your friends or hers! Women have to be more careful, everyday this can be scary to us. We ask you for understanding... you want all guests in your house to be comfortable, definitely take it as a lesson and apologize to your coworker.", "Eh, gentle ESH. It was on you to make the situation clear and to be aware of how uncomfortable women can be around men (because of *gestures at widespread violence against women*), and it was on her to ask as well. Just a basic lack of communication. I think a coffee walk and a sincere apology will help sort it out.", "INFO: What was the game, and how big was the gathering? \n\nTrying to gauge what her expectations might have been based on what she was invited to. Like if someone invited me over to play something like Cards Against Humanity, I would expect maybe more men than woman since I\u2019m being invited by a man, but it\u2019s not necessarily a man-leaning game. If a guy invited me over to play Madden or DND, I would expect mostly if not all men (not that women can\u2019t or don\u2019t play these games, but more men do than women). For size of the group, I think it\u2019s more about how potentially uncomfortable the situation was. Personally I wouldn\u2019t feel very uncomfortable if it was like me, the guy I knew, and two other guys, but if it was a group of like 8 guys and me I might start to feel out of place and like it wouldn\u2019t be noticed as easily if one of them was being weird towards me. \n\nEven with all that, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole. But now that you know, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to consider it in the future. Whether she is an asshole I think depends on the situation. If she really is that bothered by being the only woman and knew it was a very male-leaning game, I think she should have taken it upon herself to ask. But if it was a \u201cgender neutral\u201d game and ended up being a large group, she might not have realized the situation would feel uncomfortable until she got there (but I still don\u2019t think she should be angry towards you if that\u2019s the case).", "NAH\n\nI\u2019ve been in groups where only one woman was present. I\u2019ve also been the only guy with several woman. Sometimes the groups can be fine. Sometimes the odd one out get sexually harassed. In my experience women have been more aggressive when I\u2019m the only guy. But she may have similar experiences. I\u2019m with you, if it\u2019s something she worries about she needs to check with the host. If you had no reason to believe she would be at risk with your group why would you think to inform her?", "Loosely NAH. But here's what I hope you'll take from this:\n\nFor whatever reason, your co-worker didn't ask ahead of time about the gender breakdown of your game. I don't know why, but she was absolutely understandably uncomfortable when she got there and made what she felt was the best decision for herself. Based on your life experience, you couldn't have really foreseen that you would have done well to tell her that it was going to be all men.\n\nBut now you know. My hope for you is that you'll apologize to her sincerely. You didn't intend to put her into a situation where she was uncomfortable, but someone felt uncomfortable in your home. I would hope that you feel a little bit bad about that, even if you didn't know you could take steps to prevent it.\n\nGoing forward, I hope you do mention to people who may be vulnerable that they will be the only ones like themselves there. I have absolutely as a white woman given friends of color. A heads up if everyone else involved in an activity was also white. My white friends are kind good people and I'm comfortable at this point in my life about vouching for them, but I don't expect a POC to just *know* that and I want them to be able to give informed consent. Now that you know something many women have to deal with, I hope you use the information.", "ESH - its a safety thing. Woman are assulted or worse every day all over the world in countless different situations. Im not suprised she was uncomfortable being in a house will unfamiliar men. \n\nIts something you, as a man and a decent human being, shold be aware. However, she should have also asked who would also being going if she had safety concerns. So both of you missed the boat and made an uncomfortable situation.", "NAH\n\nI mean if it was me I would have 100% told her she would be the only woman. As A male with a large mixed gender friend group this is honestly pretty common curtesy. But also if that would be a deal breaker to her its her responsibility to ask herself", "NTA. \n\nIf she has concerns, she needs to list them. \n\nIf she's allergic to pets or food items, you can't magically know that.

That didn't occur to you because you haven't experienced it but just bear it in mind for the future. Women have to navigate the world differently to men in order to stay safe. You put her in a position where she felt extremely vulnerable and likely spent the evening gauging and second guessing every reaction she had with each man there, trying to figure out if any of them were going to follow her to the bathroom or her car.", "Nta it\u2019s a touchy subject but imo she could\u2019ve asked", "I don\u2019t blame the co-worker for leaving if she felt uncomfortable, but I DO blame her for her reaction the next day. Her trauma is not your responsibility. And I say this as someone with significant trauma caused by men. I never put myself in situations I feel uncomfortable with. I ask questions. I do my research. Co-worker should have just made an excuse and left, without going on a rant. \n\nNTA.", "NTA she should've asked then", "NTA. I almost went N A H since it seems like an easy misunderstanding, but I think her response the next day was a little much. I understand why she might have safety concerns or be uncomfortable, but it makes sense for a man not to think about that because, well, they never have to. It\u2019s \u201ccommon sense\u201d that women are at greater risk of violence by men, but that doesn\u2019t automatically translate to it being \u201ccommon sense\u201d for others to warn them about every scenario that they may feel at risk in. \n\nNot only that but context matters. You invited her over for a game at your house. For one, she probably wouldn\u2019t go if she didn\u2019t at least feel comfortable with you (and by extension, it\u2019s reasonable to assume if you\u2019re safe then you\u2019d make sure others are while there). But more pertinently, as a girl with mostly guy friends who enjoys both hobby games and video games, I expect most gatherings for such to be male-dominated - and if another girl is there, they may even feel insulted if someone suggested they might be uncomfortable by it since there\u2019s an implication there that girls can\u2019t handle gaming/gaming environments.", "NTA. I disagree with the other commenters so far. I think she overreacted. I understand if she felt uncomfortable and wanted to leave, that's totally her right. But it's not on you to explain who is going to be at your place when you invite someone for a gathering. And I don't think she should have scolded you for it. I'm a woman, btw, if that makes any difference.", "Personally I would have said NTA, but I work in a male dominated field, so I may be biased.", "NTA\n\nBut tuck this into your understanding that women have a lot of reasons not to feel safe in room full of men we don\u2019t know.", "NTA-  You, a man informed her your friends would be playing a game together.  Any reasonable person would know that means mostly or entirely men will be there.  She could have asked if she had any concerns over who would be there otherwise it's a matter of trust that your friends will be fine to be around.  Your right that her response is atypical.

The only exception is if you knew she had been assaulted by men in the past. Because of my social interests and my work field, I often end up at the only women.

One of the kids associated with our local kayaking group was only 16. I was typically the only woman.

So I had told the that I would make sure to include her when I was able to go so that she had an adult woman with her in the group. This is one of the few instances that gender mattered because she was underage and for the comfort of the whole group.\n\nAnyway, assuming you didn\u2019t know of any assault issues, it was just an evening of board games.

So your argument is flawed.", "If it makes you feel better to believe that go right ahead.", "Look, the risk of assault from a group of men is terrifying, but the much greater, daily risk that OP\u2019s coworker and women in general experience when they\u2019re the only woman in a group of men is being too visible to 1-2 creeps in the group. \n\nHaving a second woman there does two things - first, she\u2019s no longer the \u201codd one out\u201d in the eyes of a creepy or misogynistic dude in the group and therefore is less likely to get an uncomfortable \u201ccompliment\u201d or a misogynistic jab framed as a joke. Second, she has a friend to stick close to her in case there is a guy she doesn\u2019t know who starts acting creepy.\n\nSo, for the very real fact that most men are not dangerous creeps (as many men love to point out), women don\u2019t need to outnumber the men to feel significantly safer, but it helps for there to be more women in the group than there are creeps. Better to assume there\u2019s 1 creep until you know everyone than to assume it\u2019s 0 and be wrong.", "And people with food allergies shouldn't say that they have allergies all the time. Just everyone else should eat food without milk, gluten, peanut, etc\n\nIf men will learn that women don't want to be with men, the world will be better.", "So it\u2019s all on him? Or am I being naive to think she could have easily asked the question to.", "You do understand that there are men in the world right now, afraid of their abusive partners, afraid for their lives, for their children's lives? You understand that there have been (and currently are) many, many instances of men being abused and murdered by women? \n\nSaying 'men are afraid that woman are going to make fun of them' is so incredibly demeaning to victims of abuse.", "Yes! As a woman who loves tabletop and also spent most of her childhood and twenties into comics - omfg the misogyny in these groups is real.", "I genuinely don\u2019t get it in this situation. Like, surely she either trusted her colleague enough to turn up to his house or she didn\u2019t? And sure, I get a world where she didn\u2019t feel comfortable accepting the invitation. But I don\u2019t get why two other guys along with her coworker playing board games is such a dangerous situation.\n\nHonestly, I feel like a lot of the comments relate more to how dangerous the world can be for women generally, and less to this specific situation.", "If you invite kids over for something, it\u2019s understood it\u2019s a kid safe event. If you invite women over for something, it\u2019s understood it\u2019s a woman safe event. By not only inviting her when she would be outnumbered, but doubling down on it, he\u2019s proven he\u2019s not safe. I guarantee she never makes that mistake again. This is not an unusual attitude or fear in a woman. It\u2019s the overwhelming majority.", "Yup. Most of them are of course husbands, boyfriends, brothers and fathers. So that's fun.", "Everyone being equal is not the same as everyone needing equal treatment. I think you need to look up equity vs equality. Understanding that a single woman feels more at risk in an unknown, all male group than a man probably would in the same situation is not rocket science. I don't think op needs to apologize but this is a good opportunity for him to understand things from a different perspective that he might not have considered previously. The same goes for you. And we are not talking about merely feeling uncomfortable, we're talking about feeling at risk and unfortunately that is something that most women have experienced in their lives. Please listen to us rather than just trying to bulldoze over our experience in an effort to 'make things equal'.", "African Americans are subject to a biased criminal justice system, so no, I don't think thats comparable. I actually authored a paper* on the impact of predictive policing and its enormous potential to harm Indigenous persons (Australia's indigenous people, a group not overtly different to African Americans in their social stigma and treatment by criminal justice systems).\n\n\n* not yet published but looking good!\n\n\nI would caution you to be wary of studies that rely on self reporting, or answers to questions without any evidence to support the claims. While they can hold merit, generally speaking their weighting regarding something like domestic violence would be significantly less than police reports or victim statements.", "Holy invalidating women's experiences batman!", "This whole idea crumbles when 2 creep exist. There will be 2 \"odd one out\". No one know how many men are creepers. Acting like it will always be just one creep is dangerous.", "Nah it doesn\u2019t does it lol all these comments are ridiculous. The whole Post is ridiculous guy did nothing wrong, she could have easily asked the question and avoided going. Everyone here thinks he\u2019s the ah for not mentioning it but she\u2019s innocent at best they suck.", "1/4th report it. The rest of us don't, or don't get taken seriously, or someone just tried to assault us. You can ask the women in their life and they'll have at least one experience of sexual assault or abuse to share.", "You can not believe me, but even in not shithole countries like the whole of Europe, myself and most women you've met are well aware that we're walking by one bad apple from getting raped.", "And yet none of that means that OPs friend made a bad, unhinged or insulting choice.", "She may have trusted her colleague to visit his house, but there were other guys there who she has had no previous interaction with. They could be fine, upstanding members of the community who would never hurt anybody or they could be fine, upstanding members of the community who have buried their victims under the patio. All it takes is one nagging doubt you get yourself out of the situation as safely as you can. The OPs situation is a reflection of how the world is for all of us.", "Those are the exact types of situations where things happen. Sexual assault happens most frequently with acquaintances or friends/relatives of people you know in private residences. She didn't know any of the other guys and sometimes men don't know that the people they surround themselves with are predators until they show their true colors.", "My experience as a man towards women was sever bullying and humiliation in my school years which lead to severe discomfort with women, but I get called an incel for that, not someone defending himself on the basis of his life experience\n\nPeople like you who validates sexism on the basis of \"stop invalidating women's experience!!!!!\" are the worse because you are actively endorsing prejudice.\n\nEvery single prejudice is born from something historical and from one's experience. \nA lot of racism and classism is also caused by one's personal experience. \"Experience\" doesn't validate a feeling, just like I know my experience with women in my life shouldn't validate the way I feel about them and it's unreasonable.", "Me: Men also deal with that stuff, in fact at higher rates in some ways. neither men nor women are inherently better or worse than the other, we are all equal human beings _equally_ capable of great good or great evil.\n\nYou: YoU'rE iNvAlIdAtInG WoMeN!!! \n\nIt was my own fault for expecting any more of you than a snide victims fall into a fainting couch. I'd point out that explaining how men _also_ face the same and different issues shouldn't iNvAlIdAtE anything (you'd laugh in the face of someone if, after your explaining of what women go through someone said that doing so invalidates men's experiences) but you're not ready for an adult conversation. Hell, that's okay- I genuinely hope you go the rest of your life privileged and ignorant, as people with sexist or any other hate based bias only tend to have their perspectives altered after a life altering event befalls them or someone they love.", "So why isn't she asking any questions before showing up at the house of someone she clearly doesn't trust to meet people she doesn't know?", "I didn't say anything about OP or their friend, I was only commenting on this statement because I found it very off-putting. Men who are victims of abuse are valid too, there is space to care for all victims and to try and protect all people from harm.", "Where did I validate sexism? Or endorse prejudice? \n\n\"Every single prejudice is born from [...] one's experience.\" \nFalse. Misogyny and racism, among many others, are deeply cultural and very much taught.", "Also, all feelings are valid. Not all responses to feelings are valid. For further explanation, see a therapist.", "Is it a common experience for the men you know  to have to plan out their safety into every area of their lives? Men commit 75% of violent crime and 99% of sexual assaults. For most sexual assaults, no weapon is used, only brute force. Women, on average, are smaller and weaker. We have to plan outour defenses and are taught to do this from a very young age. From what I gather, that is just not a common part of the male cultural experience.\n\nI am not privileged or ignorant. I have been kidnapped, sexually assaulted, beaten, and strangled by men. I do not know a single woman who has not been victimized by a man in one form or another.", "Because obviously the general consensus is this guy is they ah for not understanding women\u2019s struggles around groups of men but the chick on the other hand is at no fault for blindly walking into a social situation with someone from work who she hasn\u2019t hung out with before and expect that social setting at someone else\u2019s house to be to her preference with out asking for any details of who\u2019s attending, because duh.", "It's not embellishing anything. Women speak with one another, and women experience things themselves. Out of my friend ground of seven women, one hasn't has a traumatic experience.", "That was a dumb choice, yes. But the fact that you ignore my point and immediately find a way to place the blame on her is part of the reason why most women are hypervigilant.", "Using big words like infantilizing wrong and women do think about their comfort or safety. Everyday.", ">Where did I validate sexism?\n\nWhen a comment pointed out a double standard towards man, you responsed with \"you are invalidating women's experience\". You defended prejudice with the excuse of experience.\n\n>Misogyny and racism, among many others, are deeply cultural and very much taught.\n\nThey're still rooted in past experiences and past historical events. Just like every cultural prejudice, ever.\n\nPrejudice about black people in the US are rooted in the statistically troublesome communities where crime is endorsed by a status of poverty.\n\nAs a more personal example, as a southern italian, I face costant prejudice from my fellow northern \"italians\" because of a prejudice that is historically rooted in the socioeconomic and cultural differences between Northern and Southern Italy. \n\nI also really don't doubt the fact that a lot of northerners had bad experience with southerners. Should that validate the prejudice I face every day?\n\nIf a woman's experience validates mysandry, than my experience validates full-on racism. Experiences don't validate anything.", "Yeah, okay. It's clear you can't hear me over the sound of your own hatred. I'm sure all that is _very_ credible and you in no way have any bias. Only women suffer or fear for their safety, men are responsible for all evil and all that, great job you really showed me. I could also flail my being stabbed or drugged or watching my cat get stomped to death by a women over my head like a mace and act like my experiences with an abuser criminal means that all women are bad.. but I think weaponizing our survivals for such a petty reason is gross, and is something that someone making it up to win an argument tends to do.\n\nInstead, i'm not going to reply anymore after this- knowing your type, you're physically incapable of not having the last word, because you probably equate that to being right. So you can have it and feel as right as you need to. Anyways, I hope someday you can grow to understand that sexism is kind of shit, even if it's _just_ the socially-acceptable-to-publicly-hate men that you're demonizing based on the actions of a deplorable few. Get well soon, and may we never speak again.", "I'm sorry did you just read the previous comment or not? They just told you they've been physically abused by men and your response is to accuse them of hatred? You clearly don't have an ounce of compassion in you and you're so desperate to make your point that you appear to have lost all humanity in the process.", "That's irrelevant. My Catalan group is all women, the average has no impact on how many women there are in OPs group.\n\nAnd bdw, have you ever figured that the reason you don't see as many women is simply because they game at home or in womens spaces, as opposed to not exising? I've been to a womens support group or two and they had board games in the common spaces."]}
