Henry loves living the good life (staying at the Hilton when on trips, spending $200 on a fancy Japanese dinner, etc.) and if someone suggests going somewhere to eat that's below his standards, he throws a hissy fit.\n\nI proposed a group trip to Europe. Henry was a yes, a few were no's but the main core were on the fence. I see the main core more than Henry and I asked what's their biggest worry for going on the trip. They all said that they do not want to travel with Henry because he will double the cost of the trip. \n\nHenry hates being excluded and if we sneak away he'll know and make things worse. We know he has a LDR BF in the US (we live in Canada) and Henry goes to see him on 4^th of July, American Thanksgiving, etc. So we know when Henry is going to be gone and the idea was to tell Henry and plan the trip the Tuesday before he heads to see his BF. We think this is a good way to tell Henry and avoid him coming.\n\nI told another of my friend groups this plan (they don't know this friend group) and they said it was kind of a dick move to deliberately exclude Henry. But if Henry comes, the trip is cancelled so I insisted that this was the lesser of two evils.\n\nTL;DR- We want to take a group trip to Europe which will be pricey. We have a friend that only likes upper class things and will throw a tantrum when things don't go his way. We plan on taking the trip a couple of days before he goes to see his LDR BF so he can't come.\n\nAITA?\n\nE: since I cannot respond to comments-\n\n1. We have had face to face talks with Henry in the past and he\u2019s been retaliatory. He\u2019s typically a calm guy but very weak to criticism. Henry is a spiteful guy at times. Apparently he\u2019s still mad at one of the core guys over something that happened 6-7 years ago and is not a factor in his life.\n\n2. This is a one time thing so far. No subsequent trips planned so this should be a one off situation.\n\n3. We could set a plan but Henry will force his agenda. Henry will agree and then try to take control.\n\n4. We have addressed Henry\u2019s spending. He failed to pay his cards on time twice and a couple of guys had to bail him out. That didn\u2019t convince him to change.\n\n5. We don\u2019t bend to Henry\u2019s demands despite the hissy fits. He just has a sour look on his face and often says \u201cisn\u2019t this better than what you guys pick?\u201d when he gets his way.\n\n6. Some backstory about Henry. The group was formed out of individual friendships and became one by association and the core have become tight-knit with a couple on the periphery. Henry was a core of the group but then he became this pissy person I described, we talked to him and he fought back so we started to phase him out, multiple people have called him out because he changed and then he met his BF and reverted back to OG Henry.\n\nE^2\n\nIt may sound like we give Henry control but we don\u2019t. We just let him sit there and pout and not let him ruin our day. Multiple people have talked to him (from both his friend groups) the first time and he got better. Then he reverted back to OG Henry.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for another discussion but the fact that one group already cut him loose didn\u2019t open his eyes is probably a sign that what we say won\u2019t have any clout and his BF and BF friends enabling him takes priority.", "created_utc": 1703577036, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r31cx/aita_for_proposing_a_way_for_a_group_trip_that/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
