I responded to that by saying \u201cI truly hope that no one treats your daughter the way you treat women.\u201d This made him even angrier, saying I have no right to bring up his child when the problem is between him and I. I felt it was justified, seeing as how he has 50/50 custody and this poor child is going to spend half her life being raised by a man who feels this way about women. Now that time has passed, I feel I might have been wrong for saying that. I don\u2019t know the type of father he is, like I said I\u2019ve never met his daughter. AITA?\n\nEdit: grammar\n\nEdit 2: I assure you I\u2019m never speaking to him again. His number wasn\u2019t blocked because like I said, we had a very amicable split at the time.

Good luck to that girl, I wish her the best and I hope her mom is amazing", "Nah, NTA but in the future that big of an age gap is usually a red flag to begin with. He is looking for someone he can manipulate, and found out that you were not it by standing up to him.", "NTA - Send those texts to the daughters mom immediately. Daughter shouldn't have to grow up near such a sexist man.", "Was this via text? Cuz definitely send those texts to the daughters mom. This man doesn\u2019t sound safe for any women. NTA", "NTA. You didn\u2019t even say anything about how he treats his daughter. You said you hope men don\u2019t one day treat her the way he was treating you. That was a great response, honestly. Hopefully it will put things in perspective for him. He (presumably) wouldn\u2019t want men to be an AH to his daughter, but he\u2019s being an AH to you. He sucks a lot.", "NTA. Sounds like you dodged a bullet there.", "NTA\n\nDave is a creep by being a 40-year-old man going after women in their early 20s.\n\nI'm proud of you for standing up for yourself. Many women would've been manipulated for far too long by a \"Dave\". Even if he wasn't this old, he still has zero empathy for women, especially since he has a daughter.", "NTA, some dudes are just incapable of having empathy for women until you phrase it like that.", "NTA. It was a good reminder that his 7yo is going to grow up to be a woman someday. Does he really think it\u2019s ok for a man to treat any woman, his daughter included, like that?", "NTA.\n\nHonestly though, the age is the biggest red flag. There's a reason why he couldn't date women his own age.", "I'm going with NTA here. You told him you didn't like that talk then he turned it around on you. There is no problem between the two of you.... you're done with him. And no, he would probably want to punch any man that ever talked to his daughter like this...", "NTA- you said exactly the right thing. I couldn't think of a better response to his nonsense.", "NTA.  you deserve to be treated respectfully.  Sounds like Davey could benefit from therapy.  He got angry because you're right about how he's speaking.  It was all fun and games until then.  The problem isn't between you and him.  It's between his brain and his mouth.   On behalf of all men, I apologize for his behavior \ud83e\udd23  jk.  But I am sorry you were treated this way.", "Based on the title I was prepared to vote the other way, however in reading the context 100% NTA. Block that shit and never look back.", "NTA, he\u2019s scary.", "NTA.  I really hope it gave him pause.", "NTA. You made a valid point.

She's 17 years younger than him. He's sore that she pointed out that he's being aggressively misogynistic in a specifically sexual way to her as a father of a young girl; it SHOULD hit close to home, seeing as how he could have fathered her as easily as his own daughter. \n\nThis is LITERALLY how he views and treats young women who COULD be his daughter. Good for her for pointing it out.", "My age was a turn on for him. I was 22 at the time we met and he wouldn\u2019t go 2 days without reminding me of my own age.

Send the texts to his daughter's mother if you can", "NTA. It never ceases to amaze me how men can come back into your life years after a relationship has ended, and just act like they still have a right to make intimate comments like that. They don't seem to get the fact that your relationship status has changed, your boundaries have changed, and they are no longer welcome to say those kinds of things any more.\n\nI've had men disappear for decades and then behave as if they could walk back in at any time and resume sleeping with me, like they had some kind of right to intimate access despite the breakup and time lapse. To me, once a breakup occurs, boundaries go up and it becomes inappropriate to make intimate comments. That ship has sailed.", "NTA, but you oh NEED to send any of these texts to his ex wife. He may not be safe to be around his daughter."]}
