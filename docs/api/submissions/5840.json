I\u2019m the only lesbian in our family and they\u2019re not very supportive of it. I met her on a dating app aimed at LGBT people. \n\nJan has always been a jealous type, if somebody had the same hair colour as her she would throw a fit, if I seemed happy she\u2019d do her best to drag me down. When it came to my gf she was happy for me but would seem dismissive or aggressively change the subject when she came up. \n\nJan has a bf (27m) who she met though work while in a relationship and ended up cheating on her previous bf with him same day after her shift. Obviously I despise cheaters.  \n\nOver Christmas her and her bf made several sexist or homophobic remarks and comments which where pretty aggravating. At one point he said he hated the idea of having girl kids and would just get rid of them bc \u201cgirls just don\u2019t like eachother\u201d\n\nI quipped that some girls like girls and my gf and I where living proof. After an uncomfortable silence my sister snapped a little at me to stop reading too much into jokes and asked \u201chow did you even meet *her* anyway\u201d in a rude tone. \n\nWhen I said a lgbt dating app she rolled her eyes and said that was \u201cf*cking boring\u201d before laughing and looking at her bf with a smug expression. \n\nI was tired and really fed up. I snapped at her and asked \u201cwell how did you meet bf again? At work or after your shift?\u201d The fact she had cheated on her ex with her current bf the day they met is still a sore subject despite being years ago. \n\nShe yelled at me and said I didn\u2019t need to remind them of that. She went on to make snide remarks about how at least they met in person which I responded that at least I was sure i wanted to be with her when we met. \n\nThey didn\u2019t start actually dating until weeks after constant sneaking around and sister only left her ex after being caught. I heard them arguing over this fact that night when everybody was asleep. \n\nAITA? Apparently I caused a fight between my sister and her bf over her ex.", "created_utc": 1672218934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx565d/aita_for_reminding_my_sister_of_how_she_met_her/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
