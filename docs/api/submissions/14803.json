By the response I extrapolate it was snarky and negative but I don't actually understand what they were getting at?\n\nEdit:Never mind, I just got it. I reread it and *Facepalm* it went right over my head the first time because I don't understand grown adults acting like this", "Somebody contact the admins and *please* get ABJ added. That\u2019s a great idea that I could have used a few times by now. \ud83d\udc4d", "But....I'm not the bigger person. Not/s lol", "I've learned two defense tips after being bullied heavily in middle school, 1) agree with said person which leaves them unsure what to say next or 2) kick it up a notch and make them feel VERY uncomfortable.\n\nFor maximum effect for the repeat offenders, a combo of both should do the trick", "Not OP, but I also lost about 20 lbs in 2 months. Went from 172 to 150. Literally all I did was watch my calories. My maximum caloric intake was 1550 calories, as that was my calculated daily burn (basal metabolic rate). Basically, even if I sat on my ass all day, I would burn 1550 calories, so making sure I ate less than that would guarantee a caloric deficit. It's not a perfect system, but it gives you a place to start. Most days I ate between 1000 and 1500 calories and I felt perfectly fine. \n\nI'm not a healthy eater at all, but with this, I was more likely to go for fruits rather than cereal, chips, etc because I knew the fruit was lower in calories = I could eat more for dinner later \ud83d\ude02", "[removed]", "Same here. I didn\u2019t see the insult. To me, it came across as OP being a bully for the sake of revenge, not because she was just insulted herself. YTA.", "Yeah, I re-read it a couple times and have no idea how it\u2019s an insult. \n\nOP just sounds like a jerk", "Lol thank you", "Lmaoo I applaud you", "From what I've seen and heard from mutual friend she has a type of body dysmorphia where despite being so fat she doesn't think she's fat. Like despite her size, our mutual friend has vented to me about them hanging out and her making comments like \"wow you really ordered all that?\" Or \"maybe if you ate just a bit less you could land a date\" so she hasn't changed since highschool", "Lol a good YTA \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "No, she said if she looked like her she would never wear that dress.", "I mean I didn't just randomly walk up to her and call her fat, but ok", "I already got 4 years of it from her, this was me returning the energy and it might make me an AH this time, but I don't regret it", "Aww thank you lol", "This was an exception, I promise it's not my normal response. I was bullied since I was 4 so I know how much it can hurt a person. I 99% of the time ignore it or turn it into a self depricating joke. But this girl targeted me for years, and tortured me. I asked for help I even spoke to her parents and they basically said while she's at school she's not their problem. So this was my chance to return her energy. But regardless I don't regret what I said to her", "NTA- What\u2019s worse is an adult who still acts like a teen. OP did nothing wrong but respond back to someone who was being insulting TO HER. OP was simply walking with her mother, the bully was the one to strike up the conversation. Turning the other cheek is bullshit haha", "It's only because it was her, I don't normally insult people back as I lived through years of insults. But it was just because this was the one person who seemed to make it their personal goal to torture me in every way", "I think you're misunderstanding the 'pleasantness'. \n\nOP was with her mom, so a bully like that wasn't going to come out and say something straight up nasty within earshot of someone who's likely to defend her. It sounds to me like it was absolutely a backhanded compliment, aimed to sting under a veneer of politeness.\n\nI've been on the receiving end of that before, and it's so damn satisfying turning it back on them with a polite smile...\n\n\"that outfit is very... brave.\"\n\n\"thank you, I like having my own style!\"\n\n\"n-no, what I mean is, you, um, look like you know what you're doing?\"\n\n\"Thanks, I know!\"\n\nObviously this option is less... direct... than OP's but also it was in a professional setting, which made her look worse. Just because someone smiles when they 'politely' insult you doesn't mean they're being nice. Personally, I think OP was harsh but fair, and would probably have high fived her if I'd been present.", "\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I'll accept it", "Lmao just means you're more mature than the other person. Bigger as in maturity, not size lol", "Lmao I do know actually. She is not trying to better herself, she even tries to shame our mutual friends who are much skinnier than both of us and they vent to me about her. We live in a small town so keeping up with people isn't difficult. Also why would I say thank you? She said she wouldn't wear the dress if she looked like me. I'm supposed to thank her for insulting me?", "Lol", "Thank you, also happy cake day !", "Sadly yes, she superglued my locker shut, she tore up my textbook and left it on my seat to try to make me have to pay for it but thankfully she was stupid about it since our school had cameras she was caught but only got detention. She also threw scissors at me, tried to start a rumor I slept around (funnily enough because I was fat and not attractive  nobody believed her lol)", "Lol thank you", "My parents always told me just to ignore the bullies. Hard to ignore them when they're damaging your stuff, stealing from you, and physically hurting you.", "She was still trying to bully you and you shut her down OP", "Only if she hadn't lost that weight.", "Yeah sometimes we have to revert back to petty teenager mode to read some of these because some people never grow up.\n\nThat said can we ask the mods to give us the ABJ judgement option, cause God it fit a few of these stories.

Those aren't the only two options for responses. You obviously can't control what she says or how she responds, but rather than insulting her or yourself, you could tell her that when she says things like that, they hurt your feelings. You can just be honest. It's like calling her out and she'll probably be less likely to do it again.", "\ud83d\ude42", "Don\u2019t get me wrong I do sympathize with your position here given it was someone who bullied you in the past, hence why it was a soft YTA - like a very soft YTA.", "Thank you lol", "I'm not sure taking insults means a person is more mature either though", "Thank you I didn\u2019t notice\ud83e\udd73", "the person that commented this didn\u2019t understand the sarcasm in the joke the bully made", "I was in your shoes once upon a time, only way I was able to stop was throwing hands...  \n\n\nIm ecstatic that it didnt go that route for you too!", "\u201cTurn the other cheek\u201d was a culturally specific form of passive resistance. At that point you would backhand someone who was young inferior, but a slap with an open palm was to an equal.

You force the person to acknowledge you as their equal.", "My grandma always used to say that \u201cthey bully you because they like you\u201d. What a crock of shit.

She was a size 0-2 and I was a size 6-9 during the years. So when I say \"SO much bigger\" is because she went from a 0 to a 22-24, also I literally said I'm still fat, so none of this \"all she saw was her weight\" all I saw was a girl who tortured me for years. I don't give a fuck about her weight that was just a bonus. If ANYONE else had insulted me, regardless if they were skinny or fat, I would have ignored it.
