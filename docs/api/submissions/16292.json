She easily could have just gotten something for herself", "NTA unless there's more info you've forgotten to share. You aren't obligated to spend your money on anyone and you have the autonomy to choose what you eat yourself. The only way you would be the AH is how you said it to her. If your tone was condescending or judgemental, I can see how she would think you're trying to guilt her. But if you had a neutral or normal tone, definitely not the AH. You are free to eat what you would like to, she is free to eat what she would like to. You're both entitled to spend your own personal money on what you want to.", "NTA at all, although there seems to be some disconnect between you and her on the reason for the dispute--which I guess is why her position in this story seems underdeveloped. Somewhere between the possibilities of spending more quality time with you (as opposed to your focus being on cooking), connecting by eating the same meal at the same time, your tone in communicating your choice, etc., there is some reason for why she cared about this enough to make a mountain out of a molehill.", "NTA, I hate when you're trying to watch your weight/money and feel pressured into breaking your restraint", "NTA and I feel like people aren't reading this correctly. \n\nThe both of you planned out dinner to cook. She changed her mind and wants takeaway and wants YOU to pay for it. You can't afford it.

If she wants take out; I'm not seeing why she can't buy it for the two of you.\n\nI'm sure a lot of people will say its just $20 (for 2); but I don't know your budget enough to say you have extra cash.\n\nYou aren't obligated to buy other people meals just because they ask.

If this is typical behaviour for her, it must be pretty aggravating to deal with.", "NTA. There's no question here at all.", "On the whole, NTA.

However you're failing to see the type of connection your girlfriend wants with you.

She's not saying she doesn't want to cook, she's saying she doesn't want the meal we had planned to eat", "The takeaway would be getting delivered so neither of us would need to pick it up. Yeah I said I'd cook but it's not that she didn't want to cook, it's that she didn't want that meal", "I tend to cook more.

You decide.\n\nWhy can't she meet her own needs?", "I'm not stopping her ordering out though. Why should it be me paying when I won't be eating anything?", "Gotcha. Did you say you can make her dinner instead of do some takeaway because you can\u2019t afford it?", "Then NTA. Totally her call if she wants to order in, and sounds like you were supportive of whatever she wanted to do, but you weren\u2019t comfortable spending the money for yourself. It\u2019s ok that she\u2019s disappointed you don\u2019t want to do the same thing as her, but that doesn\u2019t make you TA.", "Why do anything for her?  You don't have to do anything. But you're choosing to be in this relationship.  It would be a nice thing to do for her.  When I feel like shit and my partner buys me food out, it really does mean a lot to me.  No he's not required to.  But that's not the point.", "Yeah she knew I'd be cooking since she wasn't feeling great", "Worse than that, she wasn't just disappointed, she went above and beyond to pressure, manipulate, guilt, etc.\n\nNo way is OP the AH.  But she's awfully close to the line, if not over.", "So I'm supposed to spend money I don't really have on something I don't need? Why do you not think my gf should use her own money?", "Just to clarify, you say she knew because you offered to cook at home with your words or because you assumed that she would assume you would cook?", "Don\u2019t know why this commenter is bringing up \u201cthe female side of things\u201d. As someone also on the \u201cfemale side of things\u201d sometimes you\u2019re having a terrible mental health day and you still don\u2019t have money to spend to help make it better. She can use hers if she has some.\n\nIf you can do a nice gesture it\u2019s nice but it should be completely understandable that it can\u2019t cost money.", "I'm trying to explain to you from the female side of things that it's *not about the food* but the gesture.  Go ahead and do what you want.  Just trying to help you out here in understanding what is likely going on.", "Yeah I told her", "Sorry but stop saying it's a female thing, I'm also female and it is NOT.", "Again though you fail to answer why you don't think my gf should use her own money?", "Then NTA \n\nIf she wants take away, she can pay for it. If you can\u2019t afford to eat out, then there\u2019s nothing you can do- financial responsibility is more important than food cravings.", "Why don't you go ask her.  I think a conversation with her makes more sense than all of these replies from strangers.", "You're pretty dense and I feel bad for the girlfriend honestly. She wants to have a meal together. Did you try suggesting a compromise and that you'll cook the originally planned meal for both of you? That she won't have to worry about cooking and you're short on money right now so you'll go ahead and make a nice meal for the both of you so that you both can enjoy it together?\n\nIt's about understanding her feelings and where she is coming from. You're making it a you vs. her situation and honestly it's really dense. My boyfriend treats me to my favorite treats and food when I am either physically or mentally unwell. And honestly it's the best feeling ever because it's so caring and shows his love for me. He always makes sure that I feel included and I appreciate that greatly.", "No I'm not dense. If I can't afford something, why should my gf not be paying for it when it's something she wants?\n\nYes I said I'd cook the meal myself and she refused and said she wants a takeaway. So you think I should spend money I don't have because my gf wants it? Do you not realise you can show someone you care without spending money?", "I agree with you, if you can\u2019t afford it you can\u2019t afford it. I\u2019m a female and when I\u2019m having a shitty day my husband will order out but most times well just agree to fend for ourselves. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong that I can see, eating out at least in Canada has gotten ridiculously expensive.", "You should give this lecture to your girlfriend. I'm sure that will go over well.  If you only posted to get validation for what you're doing, you can read the other responses to feel good about yourself.  Honestly trying to help you out here and it's like you had no intention of actually hearing an alternative perspective.", "It sounds like this is a reoccurring issue for you two.\n\nShe said you guys haven't gotten food from a restaurant in months and probably have been living frugally (at least for you, idk what her financial situation is like). When you're in a mental state like that, sometimes you just want to enjoy something nice once in awhile. I can tell you that it's worth more than money, but it's your decision at the end. It's about doing it for her even though you don't necessarily understand or agree. It's kind of what a relationship calls for at times... Making sacrifices for the one you love because you know that's what they need, it'll make them feel a whole lot better, you love them, want to support them, etc.", "So you think I should spend money I don't have because my gf asked? \n\nDo you not understand what not being able to afford something means or do you think money just appears because my gf wants food?\n\nAgain though you fail to answer why you think my gf should not be using her own money?", "No I never said we haven't gotten food from a restaurant in months. I said we haven't had a takeaway in months. We've been to restaurants. It's not about living frugally, just because I don't regularly order takeaways it doesn't mean I'm living frugally."]}
