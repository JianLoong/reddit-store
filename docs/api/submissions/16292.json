That she won't have to worry about cooking and you're short on money right now so you'll go ahead and make a nice meal for the both of you so that you both can enjoy it together?\n\nIt's about understanding her feelings and where she is coming from.

Do you not realise you can show someone you care without spending money?", "I agree with you, if you can\u2019t afford it you can\u2019t afford it. I\u2019m a female and when I\u2019m having a shitty day my husband will order out but most times well just agree to fend for ourselves.

When you're in a mental state like that, sometimes you just want to enjoy something nice once in awhile. I can tell you that it's worth more than money, but it's your decision at the end. It's about doing it for her even though you don't necessarily understand or agree. It's kind of what a relationship calls for at times... Making sacrifices for the one you love because you know that's what they need, it'll make them feel a whole lot better, you love them, want to support them, etc.", "So you think I should spend money I don't have because my gf asked? \n\nDo you not understand what not being able to afford something means or do you think money just appears because my gf wants food?\n\nAgain though you fail to answer why you think my gf should not be using her own money?", "No I never said we haven't gotten food from a restaurant in months. I said we haven't had a takeaway in months. We've been to restaurants. It's not about living frugally, just because I don't regularly order takeaways it doesn't mean I'm living frugally.", "Ya know, *she* could have offered to pay for *your* takeaway if she really really wanted to eat takeaway with you.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t offer.

Red flag.", "NTA.  Your gf is, though", "NTA Hate she is trying to manipulate you into getting her way. You said no and she keeps asking to get you to say yes. No is a complete sentence. She feels bad because she knows she is wrong. Sounds like you two need to have a conversation about money, manipulation and expectations in your relationship. You say seems petty, but it is not. You said no and she is testing your boundary. Does she do this on other matters to get her way? This is not about takeout, it is about disregarding your financial situations and manipulation on her part.", "NTA It sounds like she needs to grow up a little bit.", "NTA.

If you're looking for a healthier food choices, why you can't both just eat as you chose, she orders a takeaway and you eat whatever you cooked, how does this option prevent people from eating together at the same table, i can't see. Sounds like just some attempted manipulation or something ...", "NTA. I have been in this position before. Stand your ground.", "NTA.   Your GF is being an AH.  She wants take away and she wants YOU to pay for it.  If only she gets take away, I'm assuming the cost is on her.", "NTA. Is she generally manipulative? She could be and this is a red flag, orrrrr she was having a really shitty day and just wanted you to spoil/take care of her. Not the greatest way to go about it but we've all had bad days we didn't handle well. If this is typical behavior for her you did the right thing, if it's a once in a blue moon situation, I'd have just spoiled her with a takeaway and some cuddles. We're just on this big dumb rock hurdling through space for unknown reasons, sometimes you need a takeaway.", "NTA.", "When was the last time you had a date night where she didn't have to cook for you. \nEdit did she ever say it was about you buying it or was it more like I can't afford it and she replied nevermind then or was she like I don't want to eat it without you or was it can't you just pay. If she didn't say the last one then I do t see her being an ass but man you have been really defensive in replys is everything okay with you?", "NTA you are justified in not wanting takeaway and offering to cook for yourself. \n\nI know some people might say your gf is the AH for bugging you to do takeout too, and pay for her. I'm not willing to go that far b/c you said she was having a bad mental health day, and maybe this was her poor communication way of asking for some kindness and care from you, i.e., have takeaway with her and pay for it.   \n\n\nI tend to give people I'm close to the benefit of the doubt. It would obviously be better if she could ask you directly, instead of being annoyed and not communicating this to you.
