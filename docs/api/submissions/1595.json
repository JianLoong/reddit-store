You don't have to have a fitted suit.", "**NTA** \n\nHe seems to have no sense of reality or responsibility.", "NTA and that boyfriend sucks. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Big NTA.  \n\nLook at who has what responsibility.  \n\nIt's your responsibility to communicate plans to him, give him a realistic opportunity to be involved.  \n\nIt's his responsibility to listen to the agenda, make a solid choice on whether he wants to attend (in a reasonable time frame for you and the rest of the wedding to plan for it), and to otherwise prepare himself for the wedding (like have an outfit) if he wants to go.  That includes making a decision on whether he wants to go early, and then sticking with that decision even if he isn't sure later on.  \n\nIt is NOT your responsibility to nag him, or arrange his clothing.  He's a grown man, he can do that without Mommy's help (or yours).  \n\nSo let's review.  \n\nYou invited him as soon as you got your own 'bridesmaid (plus one)' invite.  You communicated to him the time and place and other information he needed to make a decision and prepare.  You did your part.  \nHe didn't make a decision, and kept going back and forth.  That prevents you from planning (to be with or without him) and prevents the wedding organizers from getting an accurate headcount.  He DIDN'T do his part.  \nHe told you the wedding wasn't important to him.  That's a red flag.  See, the wedding and the people may mean nothing to him, but YOU should mean something to him.  And if the wedding is important to you (as I'm sure it is) then as your partner he should take it seriously-- if not for them, then for you.  \nYou told him you were going no matter what.  Again, you communicated.  \nHe didn't prepare for the wedding / didn't get his clothes ready ahead of time.  He DIDN'T do his part.  \nHe refuses to attend because his suit is too tight.  I think that's a BS excuse, but whatever, his choice.  Fine.  \nHe then tries to demand you cancel on your best friend the day of her wedding.  BIG red flag.  This is major selfish / self-centered behavior.  He is obviously not at all considering what you want, what you promised your friend you'd do, or the effect it would have on you or your friend or your friendship if you disappeared last minute.  He only cares that he doesn't want to look bad in his suit and doesn't want you to go alone.  \nSo you go.  That was the right call.  Good for you.  \nThen he gets mad at you?  He has NO reason to be mad.  You've literally given him every chance to succeed, and he's backed you into a corner where there's no winning for you- you either piss him off or your friend.  \n\nSo you OP are Not The Asshole.
