{"id": 25986, "submission_id": "166w3hh", "title": "AITA for not letting my wife name our daughter what she wants?", "selftext": "I (f,28) am married to another woman, Lilly. Lilly and I have been married for about 3 years now, we love each other so much and every day still feels like our first date.\r  \n\r  \nHowever lately our relationship has been strained because she wants to give our daughter a name that i hate. I am the one who is going to give birth to our baby, however our baby is hers too. Since before we were married, we had agreed that she could name our first baby whatever she wanted, and I would name our second child. She has reviewed baby names and told me about some but I really hadn't paid much attention until a couple of weeks ago when I was working on something and she was talking to me about the two names she had decided on. She mentioned \"Jocelyn\" and then I laughed and asked if it was some kind of joke, she asked me why it would be a joke and I understood that she was being so serious.\r  \n\r  \nThe problem with \"Jocelyn\" is that it is the name of the person who bullied me for at least 5 years in a row. It was the kind of situation where your bullies pretend to be your friends and say \"it's all a joke\" so many times that even you believe it. I ended up really affected by that whole situation, bullying was practically every day. Jocelyn and other girls made cruel jokes about me, about my weight/body/face, about how \"stupid and clumsy\" I was. They would open the bathroom door when I was in it and hold it behind it so I couldn't close it, they would hide my clothes, \"punish\" me by not talking with me for days until I cried and asked them to stop ignoring me. Cruel things.\r  \n\r  \nI had therapy, and Lilly is aware of this situation, and I thought she understood because she was also bullied when she was a child. I asked her a second time if she was kidding and she said no, she said she had always thought it was a cute name so I said \"you know you won't named my daughter after my bully right?\" and she replied that baby was also her daughter, that I should give a new meaning to that name and learn to love it because she had always wanted to name her future daughter that way. She said \"consider it, maybe it will heal something in you. We're not little girls anymore\". The comment bothered me so I told her that there was nothing to consider. We started an argument about this that came to screaming and crying (mostly my crying), then she said she needed air and left the house.\r  \n\r  \nWhen she came home we were both calmer, we apologized and she promised that she would consider more options if I also considered the name she wants, so I said yes, but I wasn't going to until we talked (or fought) again last week and she said she was hurt because I didn't take her opinion into account and just refused, and she wanted me to apologize. She said that I was acting as a child. She also mentioned that I wasn't a little girl anymore so I should face it and not make a problem out of it. I've come to think that I did take it too far and I'm the asshole for clinging too much to the past.

But it may have been a bad idea to plant the seed that she could name the child carte blanche. \n\nShe can come up with a name but you still have to approve. Same as when you name the baby. \n\nPicking a name you had trauma with was rude.", "NTA that\u2019s nuts. So many other pretty names. Seems intentional that she has to pick the one name with the most negative connotation for you when it\u2019s her \u201cturn\u201d to pick the name.", "NTA what is her problem? There's so many other names she could choose and she's choosing to traumatize you this way.", "NTA. When people (finally) show you who they are, BELIEVE THEM. I know Reddit is a great place to hear \u201cleave the relationship,\u201d but this should be a major dealbreaker.

This is who she is. Believe her.", "Part of me thinks none of this would\u2019ve happened if you two had communicated better.\n\nBut you are absolutely NTA for reacting how you did.

This is a hill to die on.", ">Since before we were married, we had agreed that she could name our first baby whatever she wanted, and I would name our second child...Well I scream to my wife and called her an idiot too\n\nThis was a ridiculous agreement. Naming a child isn't like taking turns to choose what movie you'll watch on Netflix. People that can't even agree on a baby's name shouldn't be having a baby.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.", "NTA. Things happen in life and you adapt. I wanted to name my future son something, but ended up dating a guy with the name so of course moved on from it. Your wife should be understanding and choose another name to not further traumatize you. There are lots of good names out there and I know she can find another!", "NTA Your wife is devoid of compassion. It seems almost as if she\u2019s doing this to poke at your most tender and most vulnerable spot. It\u2019s cruel to ask you to name your child the same thing as your bully. You need to tell her no on that name. \n\nYour original naming agreement isn\u2019t going to work because your wife is dismissive of your feelings and disrespectful of your pain. New deal: one of you can lead the naming process for each child, but the other has veto power. \n\nMaybe she\u2019d like to name a son Adolf? Why not?", "NTA. \u201cYou can name the first baby, and I\u2019ll name the second\u201d does not mean \u201cYou can name the first baby literally whatever you want, even if it\u2019s something that I find incredibly hurtful.\u201d It\u2019s upsetting that she\u2019s not taking your hurt seriously, and you are not acting like a little girl just because you don\u2019t want your daughter to have the same name as someone who was cruel to you. You are _not_ little girls, which is why, as an adult, she needs to be showing more emotional maturity and sensitivity to you.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry that you\u2019ve been made to feel like you went too far, or that you\u2019re clinging to the past. You are being hurt, and no baby name should be worth hurting your partner like that. I hope your wife gets some sense.", "I believe your wife is another Jocelyn. NTA", "Okay, so tell her you plan to name your second child after her bully, or a name she absolutely despises.\n\nCouples counselling. Better communication.

Naming a child has to be a unanimous decision between parents.", "The problem here is that asinine agreement to let her name the first one, and you name the second one\n\nWtf is that?  You should both agree on a name.  Together.

She is not, however, gaslighting OP.", "I think that\u2019s a bit dramatic. \n\nOP is NTA though.

She also mentioned that I wasn't a little girl anymore so I should face it and not make a problem out of it.\n\nFucking so could she. OPs wife *knows* what hell that person put her through, how she went to therapy for it. Why would OPs wife make a problem out of this if she cared about her? She should not make it a problem, accept OPs rejection and pick another name.", "Re-read the last paragraph OP wrote. Lots going on there\u2026gaslighting being one of them.", "Not really. Her spouse\u2026..fully aware of the problems OP had and the therapy she went to partly bc of being bullied by this girl and she purposely is choosing that name and then yelling, fighting, guilting and gaslighting her to keep it. Of all the hundreds of thousands of names in this world\u2026.she is insistent on torturing her with wanting her to raise her baby with the name of her past tormented. WT actual F is up with that? That\u2019s sociopath behavior.", "She said OP should be over it, which is her imposing her beliefs on OP and dismissing OP\u2019s pain, and she manipulated OP into thinking that she\u2019s right. But that is different from a pattern of behaviour intended to convince someone that they are losing their actual sanity for the sake of manipulation.", "While not a nice thing to do, she\u2019s not a sociopath for this one thing.", "Gaslighting is also causing someone to question their perception of reality. This is gaslighting \u2026\u201dshe was hurt because I didn\u2019t take her opinion into account and just refused, and WANTED ME TO APOLOGIZE.\u201d Trying to make it seem OP is the unreasonable one causing the problem and demanding an apology\u2026.so it imprints on OP that OP is the problem. I suppose if you think the partner has any reasonable argument for this ridiculous name drama, then perhaps you think she deserves an apology, which you should take up with your therapist\u2026..because the partner is so far out of line expecting this woman to give the child she is carrying the lifelong name of her past trauma that it\u2019s absurd and can really only be intended to be controlling and cruel.", "Taking the whole thing in consideration, yes, I would say the tendencies are there.

She's just also *not gaslighting*. And no, demanding an apology from your partner when you are the one in the wrong is not the same thing as gaslighting."]}
