Lilly and I have been married for about 3 years now, we love each other so much and every day still feels like our first date.\r  \n\r  \nHowever lately our relationship has been strained because she wants to give our daughter a name that i hate. I am the one who is going to give birth to our baby, however our baby is hers too. Since before we were married, we had agreed that she could name our first baby whatever she wanted, and I would name our second child. She has reviewed baby names and told me about some but I really hadn't paid much attention until a couple of weeks ago when I was working on something and she was talking to me about the two names she had decided on. She mentioned \"Jocelyn\" and then I laughed and asked if it was some kind of joke, she asked me why it would be a joke and I understood that she was being so serious.\r  \n\r  \nThe problem with \"Jocelyn\" is that it is the name of the person who bullied me for at least 5 years in a row. It was the kind of situation where your bullies pretend to be your friends and say \"it's all a joke\" so many times that even you believe it. I ended up really affected by that whole situation, bullying was practically every day. Jocelyn and other girls made cruel jokes about me, about my weight/body/face, about how \"stupid and clumsy\" I was. They would open the bathroom door when I was in it and hold it behind it so I couldn't close it, they would hide my clothes, \"punish\" me by not talking with me for days until I cried and asked them to stop ignoring me. Cruel things.\r  \n\r  \nI had therapy, and Lilly is aware of this situation, and I thought she understood because she was also bullied when she was a child. I asked her a second time if she was kidding and she said no, she said she had always thought it was a cute name so I said \"you know you won't named my daughter after my bully right?\" and she replied that baby was also her daughter, that I should give a new meaning to that name and learn to love it because she had always wanted to name her future daughter that way. She said \"consider it, maybe it will heal something in you. We're not little girls anymore\". The comment bothered me so I told her that there was nothing to consider. We started an argument about this that came to screaming and crying (mostly my crying), then she said she needed air and left the house.\r  \n\r  \nWhen she came home we were both calmer, we apologized and she promised that she would consider more options if I also considered the name she wants, so I said yes, but I wasn't going to until we talked (or fought) again last week and she said she was hurt because I didn't take her opinion into account and just refused, and she wanted me to apologize. She said that I was acting as a child. She also mentioned that I wasn't a little girl anymore so I should face it and not make a problem out of it. I've come to think that I did take it too far and I'm the asshole for clinging too much to the past.

But that\u2019s not bad enough, she has to double down on it, she tries to emotionally manipulate and guilty you into getting her own way and she dismisses your pain as unimportant.  This is not the action of a loving, stable partner.  This is the behaviour of someone who seems to be deliberately trying to both wound and control you.  It\u2019s utterly unconscionable to behave like this towards someone at the best of times but to do so whilst you\u2019re pregnant, with all the physical and emotional changes that brings, is absolutely abhorrent.

I\u2019m sorry you need to stand your ground on this one. There are plenty of names out there with Lyn at the end if that\u2019s what she likes but don\u2019t let her name her after your bully ffs my bullies in work were Lyn and Kathy and in school I have forgot those names kinda but if I had a baby I\u2019d go mad at lynn or Kathy being mentioned", "Lilly needs to pick a new name.", "NTA.  Granted you have an agreement.  However, the agreement needs to include right of refusal.  It boggles me that your partner is agreeable to signing you for several more years of therapy\u2026.this is not a hill for her to die on\u2026there are so many other names she can choose.", ">so I said yes, but I wasn't going to\n\nYTA.  You said yes just to get your way.", "Why do couples continue to make these types of agreements? \u201cYou name baby #1 and I\u2019ll name baby #2\u201d or \u201cyou name the girls, I\u2019ll name the boys\u201d. \n\nThese arrangements NEVER go well. Children\u2019s names should be \u2018two yes, one no\u2019 so both parents are on board.", "Yeah no. Please don\u2019t be with someone who things neglecting your trauma is okay and gaslighting you for it. NTA but please don\u2019t stay in this relationship.", "NTA, but say \"I considered it, and the thought of my bully and abuser every day is too much. We've also already had a fight because of this name, so it will always be upsetting as it is off to a bad start.\"\n\nIf she refuses to budge, then yall two need to probably split as you don't deserve the stress and she has zero care about you as a partner.", "NTA. Your wife is the AH.\n\nShe knew that name bothered you and still wants it as a baby name. Telling you, that you\u2019re acting like a child.\u2026your wife\u2019s true colors are coming out.\n\nEven though you promised her to name the first baby, it\u2019s your baby too. You have a say on it. \nYou also have a valid reason.", "NTA, I had friends just like this, and my partner and I are fully aware their names are out of the question if kids come along.", "NTA\n\nPeople should always be able to blackball certain names.", "NTA\n\nHow could she?! She knew she was hurting you by using that name and still went on ahead and now she's throwing a temper tantrum because you hate that name? Horrible behaviour. I don't like your wife.", "NTA- your wife sounds like she was the bully, not the one being bullied and honestly not much seems to of changed. She doesn\u2019t consider your feelings valid and is going to purposely name your daughter something you hate to cause a wedge between you and the baby.  Honestly you should rethink your relationship with your wife, she doesn\u2019t seem to value you as a person or a partner so I doubt she will value you as a mother to your child either.", "NTA she is just down right cruel by wanting you name your child that.", "Yes. And that \u201cevery day feels like our first date\u201d \u2014 is there lovebombing going on? Things are rarely authentically so perfect.", "Especially when there are specific names with trauma associations for you, that needed to be stated from the outset\u2026like it\u2019s still messed that she wants to name the baby something which actively upsets her wife, but the agreement was \u201canything she wanted\u201d and OP has admitted to \u201cnot paying attention\u201d to the naming process until now, and I genuinely wonder if that means she was told about the possible name and wasn\u2019t paying attention. It\u2019s completely reasonable to not want your childhood bully to be your kids name, and to be upset that your partner is so insistent, but this wasn\u2019t remotely well handled by either partner. \n\nPoor communication, poor consideration for one another\u2019s feelings, ESH.", "Yeah I could almost understand then. She'd still be a massive ah, but if for example her family were all horribly homophobic apart from dear granny Jocelyn there'd at least be a reason.\n\nOtherwise I'd just can't get my head around it. I couldn't imagine my gf wanting to hurt me so bad like op wife.", "My parents kind of did that. My dad picked my brother\u2019s name and my mom picked mine and they both had an option for the other gender if necessary. The difference is that we\u2019re twins. And that they made sure they were both cool with all possible names. Either way, mom named me, dad named my twin, and they worked together for our little brother. Also, super grateful my dad\u2019s girl name wasn\u2019t used because he would have named one of us Rhonda.", "There's so many other names she could choose and she's choosing to traumatize you this way.", "There are actually several different types of gaslighting, one of which is using coercion to make the victim believe they are overreacting to the situation. \"You should just get over your trauma, it was so long ago, you're not a baby, it's not a big deal\" is absolutely a form of gaslighting.\n\nThe four types basically boil down to: directly lying, making the victim question reality (\"I didn't say that, you're imagining things\"), scapegoating (\"it's your fault I'm angry with you\") and coercion/manipulation of feelings (\"It's not a big deal, you're too sensitive\"). Hope that helps clear things up for you!", "she's gaslighting her.\n\nstop policing that word. it's stupid.", "Thank god finally! I always get annoyed about the overuse of this term. It's especially bad in this sub, it's basically in every second top comment.
