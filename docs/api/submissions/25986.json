Lilly and I have been married for about 3 years now, we love each other so much and every day still feels like our first date.\r  \n\r  \nHowever lately our relationship has been strained because she wants to give our daughter a name that i hate. I am the one who is going to give birth to our baby, however our baby is hers too. Since before we were married, we had agreed that she could name our first baby whatever she wanted, and I would name our second child. She has reviewed baby names and told me about some but I really hadn't paid much attention until a couple of weeks ago when I was working on something and she was talking to me about the two names she had decided on. She mentioned \"Jocelyn\" and then I laughed and asked if it was some kind of joke, she asked me why it would be a joke and I understood that she was being so serious.\r  \n\r  \nThe problem with \"Jocelyn\" is that it is the name of the person who bullied me for at least 5 years in a row. It was the kind of situation where your bullies pretend to be your friends and say \"it's all a joke\" so many times that even you believe it. I ended up really affected by that whole situation, bullying was practically every day. Jocelyn and other girls made cruel jokes about me, about my weight/body/face, about how \"stupid and clumsy\" I was. They would open the bathroom door when I was in it and hold it behind it so I couldn't close it, they would hide my clothes, \"punish\" me by not talking with me for days until I cried and asked them to stop ignoring me. Cruel things.\r  \n\r  \nI had therapy, and Lilly is aware of this situation, and I thought she understood because she was also bullied when she was a child. I asked her a second time if she was kidding and she said no, she said she had always thought it was a cute name so I said \"you know you won't named my daughter after my bully right?\" and she replied that baby was also her daughter, that I should give a new meaning to that name and learn to love it because she had always wanted to name her future daughter that way. She said \"consider it, maybe it will heal something in you. We're not little girls anymore\". The comment bothered me so I told her that there was nothing to consider. We started an argument about this that came to screaming and crying (mostly my crying), then she said she needed air and left the house.\r  \n\r  \nWhen she came home we were both calmer, we apologized and she promised that she would consider more options if I also considered the name she wants, so I said yes, but I wasn't going to until we talked (or fought) again last week and she said she was hurt because I didn't take her opinion into account and just refused, and she wanted me to apologize. She said that I was acting as a child. She also mentioned that I wasn't a little girl anymore so I should face it and not make a problem out of it. I've come to think that I did take it too far and I'm the asshole for clinging too much to the past.

Does she want you to have negative feelings associated with the child to she is the parent with the closer bond? Is she subconsciously wanting to punish you? Something seriously messed up is going on for her to be so dismissive of your trauma. If she keeps insisting on the name she does not care about you & you should reevaluate the entire relationship.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife is using your previous bullying to bully you further, so she sucks.\n\nBut you are also being foolish, making such an agreement to allow someone else to name a baby. It's a very bad idea, as you are discovering.\n\nThere is only one baby naming rule - both parents must agree. It's simple and it works.", "NTA\n\nI would leave her before baby is born. Baby\u2019s in your belly, you\u2019re giving birth, they\u2019ll ask you the name. \nF THIS B.\n\n\nYour wife is a bully, and CRAZY. She is tormenting you for fun, sounds a lot like my ex\u2014an evil narcissist sociopath.", "Do you know the name of the person who bullied your wife? Or someone she really hated or feared? Suggest that name to her. Maybe she'll understand then.", "YTA. For some unimaginable reason you told her \u201cshe could name it whatever she wanted and you\u2019d name the second child.\u201d You literally forfeited your opinion and right to veto.", "I like how we all collectively agree to hate a name due to someone else souring the name for one reason or another. I could never name someone after a person who bullied me, etc. However, there are some names I have grown to not dislike after a while. \nOP stick to your gut feeling, NTA. You do not have to accept any name that brings back bad memories of your past. I also think it is irrational to have one spouse name one child, and the other spouse name the other child. It should be a team effort, which means you should automatically rule out any options you both don't agree on.", "Yes u are bc as u said yourself, you and her had agreed that when u got ur first child, Lilly would choose the name. Then she chooses a name and u say no. None of u is a asshole but i think ur in the wrong here.", "YTA for telling your wife she could name your baby whatever she wanted and then not even being open to discussion or compromise when she tried to do exactly that. you're not an asshole for not wanting a kid named Jocelyn if that name holds bad memories for you, but the way you handled it isn't fair to your wife at all.", "ESH.... You're both right and you're both wrong", "NTA\n\nWhat is with all the people who want to name a close relative\u2019s bully? We get a LOT of these", "Oh hell no. NTA. That\u2019s actually bs and a MAJOR red flag imo. She\u2019s showing you who she is right now. Believe her. Hell, when me and my partner discussed future children we both made a list of names we both either just straight up didn\u2019t like or had negative feelings towards. My partner LOVED the name Anastasia, and although it\u2019s a beautiful name it was on my \u201cHell no\u201d list as I have negative ties to it. Rather than push it, they respected this and understood. THATS what your partner should\u2019ve done, not try to strong arm you into it.", "I think anyone who makes a stupid deal about who names a child, is the arsehole. \n\nYou can make a deal about who picks the name, but it still requires a yes from both. NTA.", "NTA. Irrespective on whether there should have been a veto - her choice, reasoning and words sound cruel. \n\nIt\u2019s not for your partner to decide how and when you heal from past trauma. \n\nBe confident to stand your ground on this, and that you won\u2019t be bullied into this decision.", "NTA and I would make this my hill to die on. And that includes a court hearing.", "Oh boy that's a mess and a half stick to your guns. Sorry she's being deliberately hurtful and I don't know why I'm not sure you know why but you need to figure that out.", "Does your wife love you enough to drop the name that could otherwise leave you bitter for the rest of your life?", "Names are a two yes situation, you've vetoed, she gets to pick something else", "NTA We've had 3 kids, ages ranging from 3-11 and the hardest part of parenthood was picking names :D\n\nNames do remind you of people and personalities, and even more so when that name is from a bully who affected your life.\n\nFor instance, Scott, I hate the name. I only knew one and he was an ok lad, but very vain and demanding, and that's what the name reminds me of.\n\nI wouldn't even say you're considering it, say you've thought about it and no, you can't name your daughter something that will make you think of trauma, it's tainting the relationship with her already. If she carries on, you can either be petty and start suggesting names of ex's or people that she doesn't like.\n\nPersonally, I'd sit down and look and places and things that mean something special to you. For instance, my daughter's middle name is the month we got married.", "Your wife ain't it.", "NTA- and I can't understand why anyone would think it would be okay to name an upcoming child after their partner's bully.  Especially for such a long period of time.\n\nI mean I really can't.  Is your partner okay that you're the one carrying the child?  Like if she names it after your bully then maybe she'll have get more of a connection with the baby than you due to the resentment of the name?\nLiterally screaming over a name.  You are currently pregnant right?  I am sorry you were having to go through extra stress when your body is going through enough.\n\nI'm sorry if that seems like a stretch, but I really can't figure out anyone would be okay with naming the child after their partners bully.\n\nUnless there is like a beloved 100 year old relative/family legacy name.  But I think something like that would have been communicated and giving you time to potentially discuss it.  Like before becoming hormone soup that is pregnancy.", "NTA. You might be too far down the road for this but when my wife was pregnant we each came up with a ranked list of baby names. I think it was 20 or 25. We each had three vetoes. Once a name was crossed off, it was out of the conversation.\n\nI suppose you run the risk of your partner deliberated adding names she knows you will object to more than Jocelyn but that points to bigger problems.", "Question for the proposed second child that you were mentioning about the naming of.\n\nHas it been decided who was going to carry that child?", "Such a compassionate wife, definitely a keeper. Will you call the second child her bullies name for more fun later on in the relationship. You can't even agree a name, I feel bad for the child's future. What more disagreements are they going to be stuck in the middle of. Sounds like a sham relationship to me", "Ask her how she would feel if you named the kid after one of her bullies.", "I can't even imagine forcefully pushing to name our kid a name that invokes pain and bad memories for my partner. \n\nI hope that you've discussed your parenting  philosophy because right now it seems it's her way or the highway which doesn't bode well.\n\nNTA", "Why does no one ever understand all names should be 2 yes 1 no? There\u2019s so many stupid posts with promises that a spouse can name a child whatever they want and somehow everyone\u2019s always surprised it\u2019s a name they don\u2019t like.", "NTA. Yes, it's a bummer for your wife that she can't have her first-choice name for your kid. But she's being disproportionately insensitive and is pressuring you. What makes it weirder is that she had two name options, and that it doesn't seem like she's loved this name for a long time.", "NTA\n\nIs your wife\u2019s name Jocelyn by any chance, because she sure seems to act like the bully who made your life so hard and caused such trauma and scarring in you.  The fact that the person who is meant to love you beyond measure, and be embarking on the parenting journey with you, is hell bent on calling the baby a name which has nothing but hurt, pain and dark memories associated with it is beyond cruel, I have no idea what on earth is going on in her head to think this is appropriate.  But that\u2019s not bad enough, she has to double down on it, she tries to emotionally manipulate and guilty you into getting her own way and she dismisses your pain as unimportant.  This is not the action of a loving, stable partner.  This is the behaviour of someone who seems to be deliberately trying to both wound and control you.  It\u2019s utterly unconscionable to behave like this towards someone at the best of times but to do so whilst you\u2019re pregnant, with all the physical and emotional changes that brings, is absolutely abhorrent.  This is someone who is absolutely determined to get her own way regardless of the price to you.  She is a bully of a much more heinous nature than your childhood bully.\n\nTo me, this is not just as simple as a falling out over a baby\u2019s name (standard 2yes/1no AITA rule applies) it speaks more of your wife\u2019s desire to hurt you, not just today but every time you look at your precious daughter.  The name Jocelyn now has two very painful associations, firstly your awful memories of your childhood bully and secondly your horrible experiences with your adult bully trying to control and coerce you.  How can your wife not see this?  How can your wife ever expect you to recover from how she\u2019s betrayed you by doing this and then pushing harder and dismissing your feelings?  How can your wife ever expect you to use the name Jocelyn every single day without being reminded every time of how she has betrayed your trust and your commitment to each other by forcing you through this.\n\nIf I were you I\u2019d be having a long, hard think about your relationship, where this is going and how this does not speak well of a positive, nurturing relationship to bring your child into.  Personally I\u2019d be asking for physical and emotional space for several weeks, along with couple\u2019s counselling, at a minimum, until your wife acknowledges how harmful her behaviour has been.  Realistically, I\u2019d be starting to make arrangements to separate.\n\nThis is not just about your baby\u2019s name any more, it runs much deeper.  I\u2019m so very sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this, there may be difficult decisions and hard times ahead, but I wish you a healthy pregnancy, a straightforward delivery, and the never ending joy of looking into the eyes of the person you created, the piece of your heart that lives outside your body and will bring you untold happiness.", "NTA\n\nYou: I am very hurt by this.\nHer: Yeah, ok, but lighten up a little. You aren't considering my feelings of wanting a cute that hurts you. \n\nSo much not okay.", "Is she really the woman you thought she was if she\u2019s minimising your trauma and not allowing you a very normal \u2018name veto\u2019 because she considered something \u2018cute\u2019?!\n\nNTA\n\nshe doesn\u2019t sound very nice to be honest.", "Pitch her bully\u2019s name in as a option and tell her the same exact thing", "My wife and I (also female) just had our first baby girl.\n\nBecause we're married, we all share my last name, I got to pick the middle name (disliked by my partner because too old fashioned, but it was my grandmothers and I love it) and my partner got to pick the first name. It was something I didn't care for, but have grown more attached to as time goes on. Truly, a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet, in the words of Shakespeare.\n\nNeither of us would have pushed a name had their been any SINCERE bad feelings stemming from it. OP your traumas should not be dismissed, but you also have to keep a level head about the fact that you can respond in the negative kindly, especially to someone you love. I know your going through a lot and it is all highlighted by the hormones going on, but something I learned is that when two women are partners and in close proximity to each other, they actually ride the same hormonal bandwidth in tandem. This is scientifically proven, not an opinion. If your wife is like me (who also did not carry my baby) she doesn't understand this yet, and culturally she is very conflicted trying to be the paternal side while also nurturing her own maternal instincts. It's hard af. She can not see the lake because she is getting stuck in the weeds, if you know what I mean, and some genuine and loving communication can easily help you two get through this.\n\nI'm not dismissing either of your thoughts and feelings, just trying to support you both and explain WHY this feels like 100x more personal/intense/emotional and difficult then it logically is.\n\nGood luck ladies, and congratulations!", "I don\u2019t know why the trend of \u201cyou name this kid, I\u2019ll name the next\u201d is so popular. Something as important as the name your child will likely have FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES is a two yes, one no type of deal. One person doesn\u2019t like the name? Then it\u2019s gone, full stop, and removed from the list of options. Not to mention, it\u2019s so odd that a loving partner would want to impose this onto the person carrying their child. What happens when, inevitably, you build up resentment towards Lilly because of this? What happens if you start resenting your daughter? The entire family collapses because your partner finds joy in emotionally tormenting you! NTA", "NTA She\u2019s not a little girl anymore but she is a bully !! She is disregarding your trauma and gaslighting you into doing what she wants . Hold your ground . If she loves you she will pick another name . She is being very unreasonable", "People have got to stop doing this!  I think it comes from having a name you are ride or die for, and you think that if you let the other person have a name it's even Steven, but that's never how it works. Both parents should have veto power.  Having kids, just like the rest of married life should be a compromise.", "Honestly, how can it not be intentional?\n\nAnd if it is, why?", "I can't but wonder if the wife is sabotaging OP's bond with the baby?  Resentment over something?  Not being the one carrying the child? Perhaps she's about jealous of that bond.  \n\nAnd if so, there are other ways to communicate that.  This is a lot of stress.", "She will nazi that one coming!", "Agreed, and naming kids needs to be 2 yes 1 no situation, OP said no so move on to the next option.", "It was a stupid thing to agree to, but it doesn't make OP an asshole.", "Yeah, these \u201cAITA for making a stupid rule in my relationship where we each get to name a child and then inevitably arguing when one of us doesn\u2019t like the name the other chooses?\u201d posts are getting old. Yeah the OP may not be an asshole but they\u2019re always an idiot for agreeing to this idiotic arrangement in the first place.", "Well they claim they have been married for 3 years but every day still feels like the first date. So I reckon there is quite a bit underneath that isn\u2019t right.", "Right? Like it wouldn't even be on the table as an option for me if I were her, let alone something I'd want to bring up to my wife ... I don't understand this behaviour. Especially the heal something comment. That's not what kids are for.", "Agree, it's really cruel!", "OP said there was cramming and screaming and she was the one crying.\n\nSo if OP was acting like a child then she was acting like an abusive parent.", "I know that we can't actually know what's going on but as I read this my brain went \"nail.on.head.\"", "There is so much complications in f4f relations that bring in a child (obviously in all relations regardless of gender.)
