We\u2019ve both complained about this, since Ben doesn\u2019t have any disabilities or anything, he\u2019s a regular 10y/o kid, and should be able to do things himself. So both of us agreed that when my mom leaves, we go our separate ways until right before she comes home.

My mom got really mad at me (not at Ben) and I got yelled at because I was a \u2018responsible babysitter who broke her trust\u2019 and as punishment I had to eat supper after them. \n\nSo I think maybe I am ta, since I broke her rules and she\u2019s not usually as mad as she was, but at the same time, Ben is *ten* and he\u2019s never gotten in trouble when I watch him.

Wander into the street without looking and get run over??\n\nObligatory anecdote: my son has been allowed to traipse around the neighborhood since he was maybe 9 or 10 by himself.

She needs to pull her head out quick and realize she's being ridiculous.", "NTA and you're mom is way off making you eat later than the rest of the family.

Because thats news to me.\n\nI live in a world where going behind someone's back because you don't agree with them in their own house makes you an ahole.", "No I'm a person that knows right from wrong. \n\nI don't agree with the moms expectations. I said as much. But they also are not overly restrictive. Be in the same room isn't a lofty expectation. \n\nI find it absurd that people here think this is \"strangely controlling\". I'd agree its a bit much. I've said so. Tough, her house. Have the discussion, deal with the verdict. Be deceitful get in trouble. All the excuses don't change the breach of trust.", "Dude ... If you are being held hostage by someone and you tell them that you don't agree with being held hostage, what do you think will happen? And will you then stop trying to escape behind the kidnapper's back, because that's immoral to do? You could just have the conversation and if it doesn't work then that's bad luck. You just have to deal with it then, because being kidnapped is no democracy.\n\nIt's not a job for OP, no matter if they are paid or not. They don't have a say in whether they babysit or not. So you cannot compare that to a job someone has to do in a certain way.", ">Dude ...

No one is being held hostage. \n\n>It's not a job for OP, no matter if they are paid or not. They don't have a say in whether they babysit or not.

I don't know when this idea kids are not responsible to contribute to a household started but they are. And they are not hostages. \n\nSitting in the same room is not the same as 100 days in terrorist held airplane. Completely ridiculous comparison.", "Babysitting isn't a chore. If you have children it's your responsibility and yours alone to take care of them. It's not your other children's responsibility to raise their siblings, even for a few hours. And if you expect that from them then you failed as a parent."]}
