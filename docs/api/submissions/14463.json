We\u2019ve both complained about this, since Ben doesn\u2019t have any disabilities or anything, he\u2019s a regular 10y/o kid, and should be able to do things himself.

This is no longer your problem to solve.", "NTA Your mom is ridiculous! Ben is 10 not 2. You were both home and safe and really that's all that should matter to your mom.", "NTA You are babysitting. Your brother is old enough to entertain himself. As long as you are there to handle any problems that come up and help him if he needs it. You shouldn't have to be in the same room. Does your mother keep him in the same room as her the entire time they are home together? If your mom is sleeping, how would she know if your brother was not sleeping and doing something else? She is setting a higher standard for you than she holds herself to. Only children with severe health or other issues get 24 hour supervision. They have to hire nurses to keep an eye on them while they sleep. This is nothing near to needing that level of supervision. It's crazy.", "NTA - most kids are free range at around 8 or 9, & would only require supervision near water, fire, or power tools.  \n\nSupervision while gaming is not required at all.", "No. Your mum is the arse hole.\n\nHe's old enough to take care of himself for a few hours. When I was a kid, during school holidays I was home by myself all day.", "NTA. As a younger sister with a 6 1/2 year age gap with my older sister you are going great for him. It\u2019s not like you left him in the house by himself. You\u2019re just in different rooms and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that because honestly the main reason you\u2019re there as far I\u2019m concerned as to make sure the house doesn\u2019t burn down and if she\u2019s injured you can take him to the hospital.\n\nKeep it up because it will help your sibling relationship when you\u2019re older because you\u2019re not seen as a parent figure but as a sibling", "NTA. Your mother needs to loosen the reigns a bit. You weren't letting him run wild. He was in HIS room playing Minecraft. Your mother is suffocating you two -- but mainly him. Is there a reason for that?", "NTA \n\nhe is your brother, not your child. she should sort out a real babysitter instead of footing everything on the eldest child. it\u2019s not fair to you. this is coming from an older sister of 3 very young boys. I still helped out because I WANTED to, but I was never forced into the role of parent/babysitter. it\u2019s not your fault.", "NTA. Who will watch Ben every minute after you graduate?", "NTA. If your mother wants a full-time jailer for her son, tell her to pay for a professional. You are Ben's sibling, neither parent nor jailer. Ben is old enough to call for help, and you're obviously caring and responsible enough to check on him regularly without hovering.", "NTA. Your mom is being unreasonable. He\u2019s 10 and seems to be perfectly happy to entertain himself without you watching him all the time. Your agreement with Ben is age appropriate and works well for both of you. Your mom needs to realize that he\u2019s not a baby and doesn\u2019t require constant monitoring.", "NTA. If he was a toddler, it would have been more appropriate for her to expect this level of monitoring him, but not for a 10 year old without any disabilities that put him at risk of harm from being in a room alone. You were close by and within easy immediately access if something happened or he needed you, which personally is the most I would ask of a teenager babysitting their 10 year old sibling in their own house. \n\nWhen she\u2019s the one home with him, does she have to stand in his room with him while he plays Minecraft? In my opinion at least, I think a 10 year old should be given a lot more independence than this, certainly at least to the point of pouring cereal and being in a room alone.", "NTA.", "NTA. He\u2019s not your kid, he\u2019s your brother, and you didn\u2019t sign up to take care of him. It sounds like he\u2019s mature enough to not need constant supervision and you\u2019re not leaving him alone in the house anyway.", "INFO: does she say in the same room with him all the time when she's home? \n\nNTA here, I think you made a perfectly reasonable decision.", "NTA- It's not like you left him at home alone. You both were home, but in different places of the house.", "Not only NTA, but you are providing to your brother a freedom he should have at his age to grow properly into a balanced human being. Children needs to have \nsome times alone and autonomous. \nThere is actually studies comparing children who never escape adults' supervision, going from one organised activities to another, to children who grow up with more freedom and those last one have more capacity to emotionally support themselves, to overcome struggle on their own, better artistic abilities also... while the supervised ones struggle a lot more at \"adulting\".", "NTA Ben 10 is 10. He has super powers and can turn into multiple species of aliens with his watch. If anything he should be taking care of you.", "Is she paying you to babysit?", "NTA Ben is 10. He is more than capable of making himself cereal. Heck my 9 year old can make scrambled eggs and regularly uses the air fryer by herself. Your mum is being ridiculous if she\u2019s expecting to watch him constantly and be in the same room. She needs to get some therapy for whatever it is that\u2019s making her do this to both you and Ben.", "It is called parentification. Please, put a stop to it. \n\nYour brother is your brother, not your son. He is not your responsibility, and your mother is the asshole.", "Info: does your mom makes him stay in the room with her at all times?\n\nIf so - N-A-H because your mom has mental health issues. \nIf not - N-T-A because that\u2019s the reasonable actions for a 10 yr old. \n\nEither way, you are in the right and I\u2019m interested to find out if your mom lets your brother toilet independently.", "NAH, your mom need to come to grips that 10 yo can be left alone", "So there are a few things here so I want to parse them.\n\nNta for giving your brother some independence. \n\nESH for hiding it from your mom, but I get how that power dynamic can make standing up to her difficult. She needs to let up.", "NAH; at ten Ben is pretty self-sufficient. But in the case of an emergency, he has you to fall back on (especially if you have a driver's license and vehicle available). That's a perfectly normal and acceptable situation that you are in screaming distance.", "NAH here.\n\nYou were supervising Ben, just not how your mother wants you to.  That doesn't make you TA, that makes you a sentient being who made a decision based on experience.\n\nYour mother asked you to do something and then stipulated no flexibility which is unrealistic. Especially given your age.\n\nThis is just an overreaction after misaligned expectations. Nothing more. Nothing less.", "yes", "YTA but softly. The only reason being that you went against what your mother asked of you. I think you and Ben are perfectly capable at your ages to have separate time while in the same home but what mom says goes. Plus eating dinner a little late is barely a punishment!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However from what you\u2019ve said, and clearly you know your brother very well, he can be trusted so I don\u2019t see the problem. I think your mum needs to look at herself and her own issues rather than flipping out on you", "That's no good either. The mom is suffocating Ben and hindering his development. How is he supposed to grow into a self-sufficient adult if he's not allowed to even pour his own cereal. This was a horrible read and I feel sorry for both kids.", "I'm sorry I totally agree with you but \"free range\" had me imagining some kid outside in a little pen and having snacks thrown at them periodically", "This is a great question because it's either that nobody does and the Mom is being crazy about it, or she *does* hover over him which honestly is worse, poor kid.", "Every time I babysit I get $5 no matter how short or long I\u2019m babysitting", "Doesn't really matter imo. That level of supervision is damaging for poor Ben's development, so screw any payment OP may be getting.", "How else are the boys supposed to handle things? They cannot stand up to their mom.

I got set out on a wooded acre with a banana and some cold cuts by my older sister every day after school.

Her babysitting meant we watched her play videos games becuase she was so much better at them.", "No seriously. I had to watch my siblings a LOT growing up and even my parents didn't care to this level lmfao. Once a kid is like 5, they can play on their own as long as somebody is in the house and the place is secure. 10 can be home alone in most places. This is just helicopter parenting of both OP and her brother.", "Totally. There's like an irrational fear that her \"baby\" will get hurt or something.", "Hey, that $5 could potentially buy you a single sandwich from a shitty fast food joint!"]}
