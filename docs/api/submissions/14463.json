We\u2019ve both complained about this, since Ben doesn\u2019t have any disabilities or anything, he\u2019s a regular 10y/o kid, and should be able to do things himself. So both of us agreed that when my mom leaves, we go our separate ways until right before she comes home.

As usual, me and Ben just did our different stuff and hung out. But at noon, my mom came home unexpectedly, she said she managed to get the time off for Easter and forgot to tell us. When she first got home, I was in my room on my phone and Ben was playing Minecraft in his room. My mom got really mad at me (not at Ben) and I got yelled at because I was a \u2018responsible babysitter who broke her trust\u2019 and as punishment I had to eat supper after them. \n\nSo I think maybe I am ta, since I broke her rules and she\u2019s not usually as mad as she was, but at the same time, Ben is *ten* and he\u2019s never gotten in trouble when I watch him.

Wander into the street without looking and get run over??\n\nObligatory anecdote: my son has been allowed to traipse around the neighborhood since he was maybe 9 or 10 by himself.

She needs to pull her head out quick and realize she's being ridiculous.", "NTA and you're mom is way off making you eat later than the rest of the family.

She also for the most part entertains herself all day by either playing in her room or hanging out with friends outside unsupervised im their yards or ours. At 10 your brother 100% can do his own thing. Your mom is being ridiculous. Also if she doesn\u2019t like the way you watch him maybe she should hire someone to do it. I can\u2019t stand parents who force their older kids to take care of younger kids.

Did she hover over YOU like this when you were 10yrs old? He's 10, so you were 7 when he was born. It seems odd she wants him watched at all times. I don't hear mention of a father so did they divorce or in some way have a falling out? Is she only like this cuz he's a male? It's kind of confusing her way of thinking. But in what universe does a babysitter sit in the room with the child for the entire time? Never in my life did my babysitters do this.\n\nHell, at 10 years old I was old enough to be home alone because the house would be locked, I knew how to use a microwave, and I wasn't a troublemaker.

Once you're a legal adult, does your mom expect you to keep up \"full engagement\" instead of going to work or college? Even if he HAD needed it, this would be the time to wean him off of \"full engagement\" before you're gone, especially if he's double-digits. He's fully capable of pouring his own cereal, and needs to learn anyway, and it speaks well of the kid that he hasn't weaponized this for maximum spoiled brat points.\n\nHave you talked to your mom about why she's this overprotective of your brother? Was he a premature birth, or did she lose a younger sibling? Once things calm down, it may be time to have a talk with her about this, especially since the system y'all have is working--unless she's assumed this was a one-time case of \"negligence,\" in which case telling her may make it worse.
