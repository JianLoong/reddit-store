We have been planning to move to John's father's state in a few years so that we can be near him to care give in his senior years.  The problem is, Jon has \"an understanding\" with his father (Clyde) that I am not okay basing my entire life around.\n\nThe plan has been to sell our place, buy a small condo in the new state, and help take care of Clyde in his old age.  When Clyde passes, Clyde will leave his house to Jon.  That sounds like a really nice and lovely plan, and I'm down to do that - if Clyde actually leaves Jon the house.\n\nThe issue is, Clyde has remarried (and not to Jon's mom).  Clyde's wife may outlive him, and Clyde's wife has children of her own.  So if Clyde passes first, she may inherit rights to live in it until her passing.  Or, depending on title, she may inherit it all as the survivor.  This would put a serious wrench in Jon's plan to inherit the home.\n\nJon absolutely refuses to ask his father about his estate planning, saying it is \"ghoulish\" and \"inappropriate\".  I appreciate this, but I'm also not okay planning my entire future to move and give up household income (Jon's) to care give when there are no formal plans in place for Jon to inherit anything that I know of, and Jon refuses to speak to his father about this.\n\nJon keeps telling me they have an understanding, and that it won't be a big deal, and that I just need to \"trust them\".  He says I'm being an asshole not trusting the relationship with his family, but I want assurances in writing before we uproot our life and affect our long-term income.

FIL could change his will at any time. I wouldn't move without being on the deed to the house. It is the only way you are guaranteed a share.

Stick to your guns on this - the level of needless risk that Jon is asking you to assume is completely insane.  Asking his father about his estate planning when you are planning to completely uproot your life and your finances in order to assist him is completely appropriate and not ghoulish in the slightest.  And it's even crazier that Jon wants to do this on your dime, but is unwilling to even broach the topic of getting the assurances you need.", "NTA. This stuff needs to be pinned down formally.", "NTA - I\u2019ve watched something similar happen to a close family friend, no plan upon the death of one parent and what was the \u201cunderstood\u201d plan just didn\u2019t happen.", "NTA.   I agree, local law may not even allow him to disinherit his wife.  You need not only a discussion but a consultation with an attorney.  I would say no.  I also do not understand why his wife cannot help with Dad's care.", "If Clyde has a wife Clyde doesn't need your husband to take care of him.  Entire thing makes no sense unless Clyde is divorcing his new wife. Also, he could sign a will and then change it after. Leaving it to his current wife, even if you move and have a \"deal\"", "NTA.  Getting it in writing now is as much for his dad\u2019s benefit as anyone else\u2019s.  That way, no one has to worry about it if something bad happens sooner than expected.  But \u201cwe had an understanding\u201d is not going to make the legalities easier to sort out after the fact, even if there are no competing agreements or no one tries challenging anything.", "Nta\n\nYou already know the new wife and her kids are going to get the lot.

I just had this happen to a friend of mine.  She uprooted her children and left a very successful career to move home to take care of her dying mother with the expectation of inheriting her mother\u2019s home.  Her mother begged her to do this, assuring her that she\u2019d be set for life and the house and all additional assets would more than make up for the sacrifices and lost income from her very lucrative job.\n\nSix years later - six long, miserable years - her mother finally died.  And that wretched bitch left EVERYTHING to some church she attended maybe half a dozen times, leaving my friend and her children homeless and screwed.\n\nBottom line, you can never trust anyone.  Not even your parents and certainly not your FIL who has a legal wife who has her own children.", "I\u2019d have him transfer the house to you guys with the understanding he can live in it until he dies. Problem is the wife, she would be entitled to it when he passes unless you own it. \n\nWhy isn\u2019t she taking care of him?", "NTA. My FIL planned for many many years to leave my husband their home and land. A few years ago, he decided to leave it to my husband and my BIL (who wasn't in the picture for decades). Now we'll all probably end up selling the property to get equal money. Definitely get it in writing before you uproot your lives, your concerns are valid.", "NTA - talk with an attorney about what is needed to protect your husband's rights here.  Your FIL doesn't \"owe\" Jon the house, but Jon doesn't \"owe\" his father to uproot his life and family to come take care of him in his old age.  This is transactional--nothing wrong with that, it is what it is.  And both parties in a transaction have the right to protection against unexpected changes.  This is a hill to die on as you could be facing financial devastation without everything being nailed down.  If Jon isn't willing to do the right thing, he needs to go alone and figure out how he's going to take care of dad full time without you funding everything.", "NAH You're right for wanting clear information before making a big life decision. Jon is right to trust his dad. \n\nIn many cases, when people remarry at an older age and they both have kids, they sign a pre-nup. It's possible that his dad has one in place. My mom remarried in her late 60s and she and her husband did this. However, she originally had it written so that if she passes first, he could stay in her house for the rest of his life. I raised an objection to that, and she changed it to say that he had to move within a specified amount of time if she passes first. (He still has his own house.)\n\nYou also want to check state laws. In my state, for example, property owned by a wife does not automatically become community property in a marriage, but property owned by a husband does. \n\nMy question is, if he is now remarried, does he even need Jon to live close to him in order to take care of him yet? Do he and his wife have a big age difference? If she can't take care of him, is her health poor as well? Will you end up taking care of both of them?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
