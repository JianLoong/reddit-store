But based on what you\u2019ve shared it seems like your gf made the jump from a lack of curiosity to willful ignorance and colorism, and racism. She should be culturally aware and curious too, which means you can share and she can listen as well. I actually wouldn\u2019t be too annoyed she hasn\u2019t come back.

If you're just vibing and she's saying, \"that's not your races vibe\" she's 1) declaring only one part of your heritage as valid and 2) trying to restrict your lifestyle to fit her stereotypes.

Because they still use race as if it's a real thing, as if it makes ppl different, and they identify strongly with it. And when someone is raised with something being their whole identity, they don't react well when they meet ppl like us. Ppl they can't relate to. It's like being a christian extremist and an atheist.

It just smacks of a very narrow worldview. But leave all this to one side. There\u2019s a reasoned discussion to have about all that.

The Columbian one lives in the UK and works in finance and has repeatedly stated that the sort of job she does here would not be as accessible to her in Columbia despite her education and connections (her verbatim words).\n\nI'm not discounting your experience, just offering a different perspective as to why what you're saying might be frustrating to black people who actually present as black.\n\nGood luck.", "You\u2019re duping the Americans here.

There are two major things that definitely make it seem like that though. \n\nThe first is that we\u2019re relatively young as a separate group. Because of that there just hasn\u2019t been the time to really mythologize and weave together all the things we do into a distinct tradition. \n\nAs kind of a point 1.5, I\u2019ll add in the fact that even though English influence was obviously huge, even early on there were all sorts of other cultures that even if they weren\u2019t fully accepted they certainly left their marks. That in combination with America\u2019s youthfulness has made things look kinda disjointed, but I kinda think that that\u2019s really how a new culture forms and it\u2019s just not obvious until it\u2019s diverged and solidified more. \n\nThe other big one is that for good or ill, the US has done an incredibly effective job of exporting our culture. As Americans we might have a hard time seeing what makes us American, but tons of people around the world have a great idea of those things because they\u2019re so exposed to our media. We just don\u2019t notice it because everywhere else we can often pick up on those things just floating in the ether of another more established culture and we then think it\u2019s not ours even though we put it there in the first place.\n\nWrapping up my rant now. There absolutely is an American culture. It\u2019s pretty much impossible to not have one. Even in awful situations like new world slavery, where people were removed from their cultural context and often both actively and passively prevented from indulging in what little they could take with them, they still developed a new culture around them just be existing. America is obviously way more culturally powerful than those we\u2019ve oppressed, so I can\u2019t believe we wouldn\u2019t have some major threads that unite at least a majority of Americans. There are a lot of differences and we don\u2019t have some of the \u201ccool\u201d established cultural heritage that other groups do, but there\u2019s something there. \n\nIt\u2019s more accurate to say that there are a bunch of American cultures that all both contribute to and borrow from the \u201cGeneric American\u201d culture, but that\u2019s true to varying degrees of any group that has such a large population. When you get big enough a monoculture is an absolute impossibility and in fact is probably not possible even in smaller groups. \n\nWe\u2019ve got a lot baggage as Americans and a whole lot of problems, but denying that there\u2019s an overall cultural identity doesn\u2019t help any of that. At least from where I stand, I think we should just stop and try to see what\u2019s around us and what we do as culture rather than just how it\u2019s always been. Culture has been used as a reason to harm and destroy for probably as long as it\u2019s existed, but it also lets us feel like we have more of a connection to our neighbors and that for sure is something we\u2019ve been lacking lately.", ">I think Americans (myself included) get so hung up on culture because we literally don\u2019t have one.\n\nNot true.", "America has a shitton of culture.

Though I'm kinda embarrassed now; I've been listening to Rage Against the Machine since I was a kid, and never bothered to look at the members of the band...", "Bloodywood is super fun, agreed. Thanks for the tips!", "Yeah.... there's shitload if white racism in other countries mate. \n\nThat's my point", "This is a good point, and it\u2019s true, I say this as a white Mexican but still even then the issues are dealt differently, so she can\u2019t force him to see it her way and still it\u2019s not that he hates Black culture but her Black culture is different than Brazilian anyway, and if he has not lived it he cannot relate.", "That\u2019s usually the worst part. \n\n\u201cToo white\u201d to be black \n\n\u201cToo black\u201d to be white", "\"Culture\" is for foreigners, as far as most people are concerned. We just see our own food, clothing, religious traditions, etc, as the way things are and don't question it.", "It's because middle American culture is a yard stick (to use an American term) for many countries, except America. The US has exported so much TV & movies that the rest of the world can identify their own culture using default American culture as the comparison. The opposite is not true. Within the US, media has largely been divided along demographics, there are TV shows marketed to black people and TV shows marketed to white people. Where I grew up, Roseanne and Fresh Prince were equally American. In America, they were for different people.", "I'm an American, and I've been arguing this for as long as I've been aware of what culture really meant. But whenever I say anything, I get a lot of angry people from all around the world (nature of my jobs has me dealing with almost solely immigrants, not to mention the people on the internet) telling me I'm wrong, and rather rudely. \"Americans don't have culture, they've copied/stolen it from other cultures,\" while valid in *some* circumstances, still completely disregardes the fact that immigrants tend to hold onto their cultural practices and pass them on to their descendants while minor changes happen constantly due to changing times and locations, or that many cultural practices were not allowed and beat out of many populaces forcing people to adapt or die).\n\nAmericans aren't *allowed* to have a culture because it upsets people. So the erroneous idea that we don't have a culture comes into existence, perpetuating the issue, leading many people to cling onto identity in whatever ways possible, whether that is being a racial minority/majority, sexual or gender identity, media identity, etc. While this happens in other countries, of course, it seems to particularly be a problem for Americans (and to some extent Canadians from what I've seen). It's this obnoxious feedback loop, and it really fucks with people's perception of what culture is, lending into further stereotypes like \"ignorant American.\"", "No, no. That we as Americans don\u2019t really have an overarching culture that we agree on. Everything seems to be regional. If you ask person A what our culture is, it\u2019ll be wholly different than culture B. But if you ask the Japanese they will tell you and it\u2019s all the same answer. We just don\u2019t have that continuity of culture.\n\nMy comment was also being humorous but I think that might\u2019ve wooshed you. Apologies.", "Not remotely a rant. Was eloquently put. You should go into anthropology, my friend.", "See but when I travel I see all that stuff everywhere too so it doesn\u2019t really feel like ours. Maybe our culture has just done too much oozing into other cultures for it to be obvious.", "Well, you obviously have the Canadian tuxedo as your culture. \ud83e\uddd0", "No, but saying that a culture you're presumably already disconnected of is yours just because of the way you look plus wanting to take one a \"black culture\" (which doesn't exist outside America, the African continent is big with a lot of diverse cultures) is.\n\nIt's fine if you want to explore your background and engage in that culture, totally fine, what's not fine is 1) Trying to force others (which aren't even from the same culture) to do the same and 2) Saying \"Oh, I'm from this culture\" when you, and every other family member you've ever met are American and you've had absolutely zero contact with said culture besides when you decided to go explore it (yes you may have background in that culture, no, you are not of that culture, those are different things)\n\nAnd no, I'm not trying to gatekeep anything, if you want to engage and live within a culture that's not yours, that's absolutely fine.", "Once I was telling her about feijoada, which is a dish in Brazil that was traditionally created by slaves and became a national thing that everyone loves basically, and she was in her words \"horrified\" that we had white owned restaurants serving \"black food\" and \"gentrified it\" by making fancy versions of it. Because I showed her a video of a famous chef in Brazil making his version of it.", "I've been to Brazil, and still don't like to assume. So I checked three recent peer reviewed studies by international organizations, and they all say the same thing. Being dark skinned in Brazil is much harder than being white skinned.

Be born?\n\nI'm proud of stuff I have accomplished myself.\n\nWhy does it matter if someone is black, white, yellow? Shouldn't the actual person be the thing that matters? Someone's character as we say here.\n\nThis enormous focus on race keeps the whole racial problems going. It's about picking sides, why are there even sides to pick from?\n\nWho even cares where someone is from? And not like someone recently migrated. But where your ancestors are from. And not just out of interest in getting to know someone better, but people basing their entire personality around what their or someone else's grandparents look like.\n\nYou want to fix racial problems or perpetuate them? Seems like the latter. I'd prefer solving them, but that's my inferior European point of view.", "It does have racism, it just isn't the main focal point of discrimination in the state I used to live in, there the main issues I seen happen where due to xenophobia, and yeah colorism is definitely big, bigger than racism, but in my personal experience xenophobia still feels like the main discrimination I've seen happen", "Lol no, OP's gf is just being blatantly racist like most Americans are\n\nYou had like 100+ years to deal with it yet your country chose not to. World's full of countries were masses of people were forcibly deported, yet USA is still one of the very few were people speak freely of race like we're still in the 1800.", "Brazil is huge, northern most point is closer to Canada than to the southern most point, culturally we can barely be called the same country depending on where you go, where I lived, it wasn't much of an issue, there are places for example in the north where there are several human rights violations from big land owners/farmers towards natives and black people, but that's not something I ever experienced or seen where I lived and it's basically as far removed for the reality of someone living where I was as a thing from another country would be. Where I lived most people would tell you most discrimination comes from xenophobia (especially against people from the northeast) and class", "Bro, Hendrix is the shit, dude was incredible", "Well I was going off of metal, but you're not wrong", "Them MFers did zero walking- they flew.", "The existence of Slash saved my young life many, many times.

Race matters to me in a way it probably won't to OP.  But at the same time, insulting him because his tastes are different than hers, while he grew up in a completely different country, is shitty.", "I mean that's kinda the crux of the situation isn't it? Different lived experiences which OP admits?  His issue is more that he has different tastes then his gf, not that he claims to be an expert on American race relations.", "What's your point?", "I mean in fairness it still hasn't been abolished in the US", "OP I think your girlfriend is picking up on the fact that you have the privilege to not consider the same things that she does. It\u2019s not nice of her to criticize your tastes, but you might understand her more if you take an interest in her culture and how she is impacted by the structural racism in America.

I'll be watching that later, thanks!", "Not a problem.  Toss in the undeniable influence of Hip Hop in the Nu Metal genre (which Rage are a among the best representations next to Deftones if you ask me) they could also be a good bridge for OP.

I doubt anyone in Japan would either.", "I'm sorry but that's absolutely ridiculous.

NTA btw", "I live in Brazil so I can say OP is right in the sense that it's not as big a discussion and not as a hot Topic like it is seen in US, yes Black communities here nowadays talk more about racial issues (mostly influenced by US political propaganda tbf) but it's not exactly alike US where it's basically a social political movement, also racism in Brazil IS different and more associated with your social status than your color skin, the way that racism Works here is different because we never had a clear division like what happened in US\n\nOP is white passing and probably is not engaged in such discussion, but so are mostly of Brazilians\n\nAlso his girlfriend seem to ignore that what happens and matters in HER country is NOT that important around the world", "Yea I was contributing to the chat in general, a ton of the chords, scales and techniques in metal are derived from blues.

It\u2019s an interesting though.", "From what I read, Black Sabbath originally meant to he a blues band, not a rock band.  Everything changed due to Tony Iommi losing the tips of his fingers in an accident.  Most regard the changes needed so he could still play his guitar with prosthetics to be the birth of Metal.\n\nEdit: what I mean to say is, metal is owes more to blues and the creators of blues then rock (which was also founded by black musicians)", "Hard agree. \n\nI used to sing lead for a few bands back in the mid 90s - 2003. I went by the name Rain back then, and my band mates used to jokingly call me Rain Staley because I tended to slip into those same kind of melismatic vocal decorations at the end of a line. I loved being the little black girl who sang alto and could crush Man In A Box, when no one else who looked like me was doing that. After high school, the stuff I got bullied for became my bread and butter. \n\nNowadays I scout bands for a few venues and book / build shows now, and I have this monthly night that\u2019s just hardcore industrial techno by Black artists and DJs. It\u2019s been really awesome; one time there was even a little slideshow included about how a lot of EDM in the states evolved from Black artists in the electronic dance / funk scene in the 70s and 80s. And from the Black neighborhoods like Detroit, Minneapolis, Brooklyn and Chicago, etc. It was pretty educational.\n\nI have all kinds of music and musicians in my roster, including some really great local rap, but one day I\u2019d love to have some sort of Black Black Metal show.

I'm glad you're still hooked into your passion and hope you pull off your metal show.", "Maybe one day you will hear me! I am writing music again so perhaps. \u201cWould\u201d is my easiest cover and still my first pick at karaoke when I\u2019m trying to decide on other songs.
