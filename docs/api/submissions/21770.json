You like what you like. That\u2019s fine. That said, it\u2019s good to be culturally aware and curious and be willing to expose yourself to new things. But based on what you\u2019ve shared it seems like your gf made the jump from a lack of curiosity to willful ignorance and colorism, and racism. She should be culturally aware and curious too, which means you can share and she can listen as well. I actually wouldn\u2019t be too annoyed she hasn\u2019t come back. It\u2019s ok to take a break and evaluate your compatibility.  Oh and there are lots of black metal artists and rock music IS African American music. \n\nNTA.", "NTA \u2013 Your girlfriend seems to want you to \u2018pick a side\u2019. Well, the idea that there are sides caused the problem in the first place. People who think that way are either racists, or are pushing back against racism in an unhelpful fashion.\n\nShe cannot force you to change your tastes, nor should she attempt to. In fact, I get the impression that your girlfriend is showing her own ignorance of cultures in countries outside of America.\n\nHowever, what she can expect is for you to be receptive to her personal experience of racial issues, and of racial issues in America more generally.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t done so already, you might consider ensuring she knows you\u2019re open to talking about all the stuff that underpins her stance on your tastes, while making it clear that changing your tastes is off the table. If you aren't open to that, then you simply aren't compatible.", "NTA. I think you need to consider if this is the right girl for you.", "YOUR heritage is BRAZILIAN not African American.\n\nYou come from a completely different culture.  I assume you spent the majority of your youth there. African American culture is NOT your culture.\n\nYour GF seemingly doesn't understand this.  That is on her.  \n\nWould she like if if you pushed Brazilian culture onto you\n\nNTA", "NTA. Not everyone participates in American identity politics.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s clearly one of those people for whom race is their entire identity. This - I have found - is a uniquely American trait. So I understand your side of it. \n\nNot liking a particular genre of music has nothing to do with where it came from. But calling something \u2018white peoples noise\u2019 is prejudice towards white people and as such is in itself: racist. As is the comment of getting genes from the \u2018right parent\u2019.\n\nYou however have not shown any signs of prejudice towards something _because_ of its origins. As such, you are simply expressing your preferences which is absolutely valid.\n\nUnsure if someone who\u2019s entire identity revolves around their skin colour could ever snap out of it, good luck OP.", "NTA\n\ntime to drop the drama queen like a flaming hot potato...she clearly likes to make an issue out of every little thing, do you really want to continue dealing with someone like that day in and day out? talk about exhausting!", "NTA. \n\nIts fine for her to want to share things that she finds culturally significant to her.  Its not ok to push those things on you if you aren't interested.  \n\nFor example, if she wanted to expose you to souther soul food, or specific music, that is fine.  But you should also be able to say its not for you, if that is the case. \n\nAnd for her to say you hate your heritage is shitty.", "Absolutely NTA. She shouldn't be pushing any type of culture on you. It's important to enjoy culture, learn about it and be proud of who you are, but no one should tell you what culture of yours is right and wrong and which one to follow. Thats just utter BS. \n\nOn the other hand, as long as you are trying things she suggests and are partaking in activities you both enjoy, and aren't completely forgoing black culture (or what she wants to share),  she shouldn't have a problem with what you like. If she's really that upset over you not drowning yourself in her culture over every other culture theres no hope cuz that wont go away", "You know what, I\u2019m gonna say NAH because you two aren\u2019t compatible and are discovering that on very clear terms. Race discussions matter a lot to her, and not at all to you. If you stay together and keep pushing each other like this, then my judgment would change to E S H.\n\nAnd before anyone says \u201cbut she started it\u201d, I don\u2019t care. This matters to her, and she wants to be with someone who it also matters to. There\u2019s no use trying to correct that.", "There is an entire planet with 1,000s of different cultures, music, food etc.\n\nWhy limit yourself to one? You miss out on so much of what life can offer.\n\nYou won't like it all but you will love some.", "NTA this is the way. You do you.", "NTA. You had a vastly different experience than her regarding your race. Possibly, it is not as integral a part of your identity as it is hers as you did not face a lot of adversity about it, or other problems you were facing were more important in shaping you. More communication might be helpful.", "You should always appreciate the culture that created a given thing and strive to respect it and its creations. They being said, liking something *solely* because of its culture is problematic, as is narrowing down a culture to one/two/ten things. Excluding things because they are \"not a part of **x** culture\" is not only problematic but short-sighted. Finally, arguing with a person about what they consider to be their culture is so wrong: we all need to decide how we choose to consider ourselves and our culture and what values, items, clothing, food, beliefs, trauma, etc we connect with from it. \n\nFor what it's worth, I teach this stuff, and I see a lot of young people who are trying so hard to connect with what they thing is the **proper** way to be ___________, that they forget they can choose. You can choose. You also don't have to be a *perfect __________* because *perfect __________s* don't exist - human ones do.", ">She in the other hand keeps trying to push \"black culture\" onto me and I keep telling her to stop\n\nShe's the asshole.\n\nMy heart goes out to those who are mixed and feel compelled to be one thing or another, but your girlfriend is 100% part of the problem insisting on one culture over another just because you're mixed. She's not helping you, she's not enriching you, she's pigeonholing you. If you're just vibing and she's saying, \"that's not your races vibe\" she's 1) declaring only one part of your heritage as valid and 2) trying to restrict your lifestyle to fit her stereotypes. This is absolutely asshole behaviour. \n\nI know I'll get a bunch of people whining about the definition of racism, but afro-centrism isn't magically appropriate just because people get side eyed for it, your girlfriend is acting like a racist.\n\nNTA", "Have mercy. That girl has\u2026issues. NTA.", "Honestly I don\u2019t know who the asshole is here, but don\u2019t do the \u201cI don\u2019t care if someone\u2019s black, white, or purple\u201d thing. Purple people don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s dismissive and not helpful to the conversation.", "She is the AH", "I hate when people say some imaginary color when referring to how colorblind they are. That's extremely insulting. There are racial issues you're ignorant to bc you're white presenting. She doesn't have to make so much emphasis on making you pick a side. Y'all both need to educate yourselves. ESH.", "NTA. I grew up in a country where the concept and ideology of \"race\" was discarded long before I was born. It's even illegal to use, so there is nothing on government forms, unlike in the US, where they require it. That is why ppl in the US and your GF are so extremely racist. Because they still use race as if it's a real thing, as if it makes ppl different, and they identify strongly with it. And when someone is raised with something being their whole identity, they don't react well when they meet ppl like us. Ppl they can't relate to. It's like being a christian extremist and an atheist. Everything the christian extremist knows about the world, doesn't apply to the atheist. So it's like their brain malfunctions. Your GF doesn't know how to navigate the world without her racial identity, and struggles with you not having one. It doesn't compute for her.", "[deleted]", "Your girlfriend is incredibly racist. Just imagine if she was fluorescently white and insisting you listen to Dave Matthews or whatever then getting mad if you wanted to eat soul food. She\u2019s obsessed with racial stereotypes. Run, don\u2019t walk. NTA.", "I think your assessment of culture in Brazil is, to coin a phrase, utter bollocks. I wouldn\u2019t even employ the clich\u00e9 white privilege here, because in my experience the children of wealthy white parents often have the leisure time to be interested in the latest product of immigrant youth culture, be it Algerian hip hop in France or Gastarbeiter music in Germany. It just smacks of a very narrow worldview. But leave all this to one side. There\u2019s a reasoned discussion to have about all that. Being so dismissive of anything that\u2019s obviously important to your partner and in which they take a strong interest is an AH move. YTA.", "ESH. You guys have separate experiences. That\u2019s fine. But both of you need to communicate better. Maybe hear her out and don\u2019t dismiss what she\u2019s saying, she might have a different experience of life than you did because she is a woman of colour. That does not invalidate your experience and you should be able to talk about these things in a mature way.", "ESH. Her comment about hating black people is over the top. Also, part of being in a relationship is sharing each others lives with each other, including interests and culture.", "ESH - I feel like you\u2019re missing some of her points and interchanging ethnicity and race. Some places even have issues with colorism. \n\nWhat do you mean \u201cpush black culture\u201d?\n\nAnd do you not understand that there\u2019s a difference between knowing your background and not?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
