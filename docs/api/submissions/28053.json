There will probably at least be a pricey dress, and maybe shoes. You may be expected to pay to get your hair and makeup professionally done. Maybe nails too, or even spray tanning. You will probably have to pay for both the travel costs to the wedding and your accommodations. There will likely be at least one shower, which you will at the very least have to attend and buy a gift for, and at most you may be the one planning and paying for it. You may also have to pay for travel to and accommodations for this event. There will likely be some kind of bachelorette party, which you will probably have to help plan and pay for. This could be something simple, but the trend is toward super extravagant bachelorette weekend, complete with matching outfits for each day.

That's it. They don't have to pay for anything else. They organise the bachelor and bachelorette parties but they don't have to pay all of it. When I was maid of honour, I organised the bachelorette party, the people who were invited and I agreed that we wanted to split the costs and leave the bride out of it, then I showed up at the wedding to sign as witness. That was the end of my duties. Nothing else was expected from me or the other bridesmaids. Of course I had to buy a dress, do my hair and make-up and put some money in the envelope as a gift for the couple, but that would have been necessary even if I was a normal guest. If the maid of honour or the best man have any additional duties, that's because the bride and groom asked because they want to copy American weddings. \n\nHere, the bride and groom organise the wedding on their own. Usually their parents help paying for it, but the organisation falls solely on the couple.

Then we went to a lake for the day before coming back to the house for a barbecue. \n\nIt\u2019s not necessary to put up for hotels, boats, vegas trips, expensive restaurants, etc. and expect everyone to drop hundreds on it. If your goal is to come celebrate with the bride it\u2019s possible to do that without racking up such a huge bill. If that\u2019s what you want to do then do that, but you can\u2019t complain when some people don\u2019t want to because they can\u2019t afford the price tag you put on it.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "He says he will travel there to give them the rings\u2026 he wont just attend the wedding", "The weddings I went to were in 1988 and 1990 lol, I'm one of the youngest of all the cousins on my dad's side.\n\nIt could also be a regional thing because I asked my mom and she never heard about it either and she's in her 70's (yes, I was on the phone with her while on reddit, she was telling me how her day is going like she always likes to and I just sit and take it in, most of it, while doing other things).", "What if you don't have a house you can do this all at?\n\nThere is no lake for us to go to. \n\nBrides parents are hoarders.

A person who she absolutely wanted at the wedding and who passed before she was able to get married. \n\nI'm not complaining. I threw my best friend an event to help her feel special during a really rough time in her life. I don't regret a single thing. We're all early to mid thirties and every single person except one paid the full amount. One had trouble paying and we helped her out as much as we could.\n\nNobody has to attend. But it sucks to hear people complain about the cost of coming to an event that somebody else organised with their blood, sweat, and tears. It's fine not to come. Both the bride and myself completely understood if people couldn't come. \n\nAnybody who has thrown large scale events like this (and have to get a **place** to actually have the party) would understand.", "I don't know, my mom is from the north of Italy and my dad is from the south.

Or maybe some families had already stopped at the time", "You made all those highly expensive choices. It\u2019s still possible to have a party without going into the thousand dollar price tag and beyond.\n\nIf I\u2019m invited to a party someone else planned, and I\u2019m not part of the wedding party (btw I wasn\u2019t even a bridesmaid for those invites) I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s already paid for. And yes I do get to complain about it when I receive the invite and realize it\u2019s actually not paid for at all and the organizers are depending on the guests to foot the bill. Without actually discussing that with anyone before the invite is given. \n\nTo talk with the bridal party about what they want to do, can/can\u2019t do, and are able to afford, and you come up with something elaborate everyone agrees on and is on board with the cost is fine. To split the bill between the bridesmaids once the plan is agreed to is also fine.\n\nTo make elaborate plans, not actually have the bill covered, and expect guests who are not bridesmaids and were not part of planning discussions and cost agreements to front hundreds is not ok. And yes I can complain about that and decline the invitation because I don\u2019t have $300 to suddenly drop when I\u2019ve never been involved in any of the other plans involving the wedding at all. It\u2019s pretty rude to send someone an invite to something with expensive strings attached. \n\nYou\u2019re taking this personally like it\u2019s an attack on your party specifically. What I\u2019m saying is if you extend an invitation to someone and they\u2019re only allowed to be there if they foot the bill for it, it\u2019s rude. It would be the same if I, or my best friend, were throwing me a birthday party and expect all the guests to pay for the cake, the decorations, purchase use of a venue, food, and then expect gifts in addition to it, when none of these guests were even involved in the original planning. \u201cWe planned a party, you\u2019re invited, but you\u2019re paying for it.\u201d", "Your English is so good!", "Maybe, not sure.

Seriously, google it. The bridemaids or MOH cover the cost of the bride themselves and other misc. items like decorations, drinks for bride, snack food, games etc. \n\nHilarious if you think that the money our guests paid covered anything other than accommodation, transportation and drinks/dinner. The amount we asked for didn't even end up covering that. \n\nMy circumstances were unique and that's why I was expanding on things. Not everyone who throws these parties is out of touch. My point was to show that the price tag includes a lot of stuff that most guests don't even think about. And that a lot of hard work goes into planning these parties. \n\nYou have every right to your feelings. It sucks not having money, I am there right now, unemployed. You can be mad you don't have the money, but it's kinda strange to be mad at the people who put in the effort of throwing a party to make someone feel celebrated. \n\nThis is the accepted etiquette for bachelorette parties in NA.\n\n**Also, Costco sandwiches, $12 sparkling wine, home cooked meal by a friend at an airbnb in town are **not** expensive choices.

It\u2019s also not uncommon for only bridesmaids to be invited to the bachelorette party. Other non-bridal party guests are saved for the bridal shower. Same with bachelor parties. It\u2019s etiquette for the groomsmen to cover the costs. That\u2019s not the point I\u2019m arguing. If I\u2019m a bridesmaid and I\u2019m involved in the discussion and planning and we agree on what we will be doing and what everyone is comfortable paying, there\u2019s no harm no foul. But if I get an invitation that says I have to shell out a few hundred for it, I\u2019m going to decline. \n\nI live in NA, I know what NA customs are.\n\nI\u2019ve been to enough bachelorette parties to know the etiquette. And I also believe if you throw a party and expect all the guests to cover it, without involving them in planning at all, then it\u2019s a party you can\u2019t afford. It\u2019s one thing to have the planners/organizers split the bill, quite another to extend that cost to others outside of that.", "You're using your personal anecdotes instead of the many (hundreds?) of websites online that discuss wedding etiquette in depth.\n\nYou clearly didn't do any research.
