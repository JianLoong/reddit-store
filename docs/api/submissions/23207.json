She probably felt absolutely stunning right up until your comment. Also, a full face of makeup on a wedding day is pretty common, not just for feeling beautiful, but to also make sure the photos turn out amazing.

LOTS of women overdo the makeup and look like totally different people on their wedding day. They do a lot of things they don't usually do on their wedding day, because it's one day that a lot of them have dreamt of and they want it to be perfect.\n\nYour job was to tell her she looked beautiful, no matter what, and say \"I do.\"\n\nCongratulations just the same. I got married over the weekend, didn't even have a wedding, and it still got dumb. Weddings and funerals are always hard to navigate because emotions are high and people are human. \n\nI recommend just telling her how lovely she was yesterday, and if she says anything about you having said she looked weird, you tell her it was shock from how beautiful she was and nerves from the big day and that you went stupid for a second, and then you tell her she was gorgeous and give her a kiss.\n\nETA: The heavy makeup is for the photography. It photographs better.", "YTA... cringe.

But on the ONE DAY she was 100% trying to look beautiful you called her \u201cweird\u201d\n\nGrovel. As a feminist who doesn\u2019t think women need a lot of make up. Grovel. This was her wedding day and her husband told her she looked weird.", "YTA. \"Love her to death\" but draw the line at full face of makeup.\nYou are the weird one to say something like that on a wedding day.\n\nAlso why is that the fact that she does not wear make up is something you adore about her? There are lots of thinks to adore and not wearing make up seems a strange one.", "YTA....how to be a husband 101. Glam makeup is usually used for events so the pictures come out better.", "[removed]", "Uhhh, yes YTA. Fine, the comment came out. You were supposed to recognize that didn't sound good and give her a glowing compliment, or at least a shamefaced apology, immediately.

You made her feel like crap on her wedding and then yalls wedding night wasnt spent in love and excited... good luck with the divorce or annulment OP that\u2019s rough", "Wow. YTA. Honestly if you don\u2019t get the gesture of a woman that rarely wears make up putting on makeup thinking you will appreciate her effort to look beautiful (probably for you) you need to work on that. Even if you didn\u2019t mean anything bad and think she is beautiful as she is, you should learn to just say \u201dwow, you are trule stunning\u201d. It\u2019s not as lie as much as it is a small and simple way of making someone you love happy.", "You done fucked up, sir.", "YTA. Why wouldn\u2019t you just ignore it, it\u2019s your wedding day? Why make her feel insecure about how she looks on, what is supposed to be, the happiest day of her life?", "YTA. I mean I get it, someone who wears no makeup most of the time is all of a sudden done up but it\u2019s her wedding day so part of me thinks you should have expected it a little, I get it though you were shocked and the term \u2018weird\u2019 probably just slipped out and now you\u2019re in a hole you couldn\u2019t really dig much deeper.\nI\u2019d just sit down with her and say is it about this comment, apologise and say it\u2019s not how you meant it to come out, you were just surprised she chose a full face when she usually chooses to wear no makeup and that she looks beautiful either way.\nI mean I don\u2019t think it\u2019s grounds for divorce but you have a looooot of making up to do", "YTA - I recommend you work on coming up with better adjectives to use. It drives me nuts when people call something \"weird\" when there are plenty of better adjectives. Usually \"weird\" is a bad thing.\n\nAlso what do you mean she's hiding something? She's likely bothered and wants to sleep on it. The next day, go apologize and say it was insensitive of you.\n\nAs for her, the cold shoulder is not healthy. Was it actually a cold shoulder, or was she just being more quiet and keeping more to herself?", "YTA. She probably put in all that work FOR YOU. She wanted YOU to think she went out of her way to look extra beautiful on your (both) very special day. And instead of a \u201cwow\u201d she got for all intents and purposes a \u201cyikes,\u201d from her perspective. You hurt her feeling but she was too classy to make a scene in public. If you don\u2019t apologize this might become a big deal in your relationship.", "YTA. Great, now all she's going to hear whenever she thinks of her wedding day is she looked weird. Not the happiness, not the beauty, not the joy of marrying someone she loves. Just your voice saying she looked weird over and over and over. You can't fix this", "Aww sweetie... YTA. You told her on her wedding day that she looked weird. Noooo....", "YTA\n\nShe prob felt awful like she looked like a glam version of herself and you are like, you don't look like you. Meaning - you are so plain usually that a glam version is entirely foreign. \n\nJust mean on a day you know she wanted to look her best.", "Well, you removed it, but I'm commenting anyway.  It's anyone's guess if that's it or not, but you absolutely fucked up telling her she looked weird.  That was the wrong word to use & I think you should talk to her about it.", "YTA. OP's partner, if you're reading this, it's not too late for an annulment! Trust me, you can find someone who tells you you look beautiful on your wedding day, not an AH who says you look \"weird\".", "YTA dude you ruined her experience of your wedding.

Of course you\u2019re the AH.\n\nMakeup for weddings is often really heavy because it makes for better photos. It\u2019s kind of like glam makeup.

I also understand how she feels. It's her big day and due to society and social media, it is expected to be extravagent for the big wedding, so I understand that she wanted to do some makeup for the big day.", "YTA   of course.", "There is no way this is real.

There's no \"hiding\" about it.\n\nYes, I understand that you were disappointed because she felt the need to wear heavy makeup for the day, and you didn't find that attractive. I agree with your aesthetic preferences - I don't find the heavily made-up look at all attractive.\n\nBut you're marrying her, not her makeup case. I have no idea whether she thought this was a good idea, or whether her mother or her friends persuaded her that she \"needed\" to wear heavy makeup for a wedding, and perhaps some of those people are assholes, but you can't control any of that.\n\nYou can control how you respond, and the thing you chose to do was to tell your new wife how weird she looked. That probably wasn't the best choice, was it?\n\nYTA\n\n(And if you don't want to lie about how great you think her heavy makeup looks, don't mention her makeup at all. Tell her how happy you are to be marrying her, or how much you love her, or something. Tell her how great her dress looks. I'm sure there were plenty of nice things you could have said that weren't about her makeup.)", "You freaking bozo this is a new level of stupidity I didn't know existed - in what world is it acceptable for the groom to tell the bride she looks \"weird\" during the wedding? Serious question - are you mentally disabled?", "Bro\u2026.giant AH\n\nIt really sucks because her future husband said this on her wedding day and completely tainted her memories.\n\nCall your mom, sisters, her friends because I don\u2019t trust you to be smart enough to figure out how to make this up to her. You need help to fix this and fix it NOW", "YTA and kinda stupid. She was wearing a lot of make up because it was a big event. I\u2019ll bet the outfit she wore probably wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d normally wear either. Wedding make up is designed to be worn for a longer amount of time and also to cater for the photography.

Why tell your partner they look WEIRD on their wedding day?\n\nYou weren't being \"honest\" or \"nice\".

Of course she looked \u201cweird\u201d to you with all that make up but in fact you\u2019re not used to her being in all that make up looking different.

Similar thoughts!", "My ex husband gave me a printer for our first Valentine\u2019s Day as a married couple and a t-shirt (that didn\u2019t fit) for our first anniversary. \n\nHis gift giving skills did not improve from there.", "Ok I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought this doesn't even sound like a wedding, it sounds like  friends meeting up at a bar.", "Women often choose something drastically different  for their wedding - curling or straightening their hair, professional makeup. Often looks a bit weird, but it might be the thing they\u2019ve always yearned for but never had the time or money to achieve before. \n\nSome of us have to practice empathy and responding to cues in different social settings. Should be obvious that to any bride the right thing to say is, you look beautiful (and if you can\u2019t honestly say that, then radiant or so happy) but this poor guy was nervous. A sincere apology and an affirmation that he loves her and she looks amazing to him in her natural state and with makeup too (it was just a surprise) should go a long way.", "I also think there's a big thing that you have to look a certain way because IT'S YOUR WEDDING!!! I do think there is a 'look' that wedding makeup artists often default to (tanned matte skin and lots of neutrals) and especially if you don't wear makeup a lot it may feel quite hard to say no to that, because they're the professionals and they know what they're doing, right? So Sarah may have felt in a position where she trusted the makeup artist and went with what they were doing, only to be shocked by OP's reaction. \n\nYes a little more makeup than normal is needed for photos, and if you're not used to it (or seeing your partner wearing it) then it can feel odd. But a good makeup artist - and there are plenty of them out there - should also be checking in regularly with the client, explaining what they're doing, picking up on body language etc, because the most important thing is that they leave happy and looking the way they want to.", "Yeah, you feel bad for them until you have one in your life, just randomly destroying you emotionally", "OMG LUCKY", "Are you even on Reddit if everyone in the comments isn\u2019t rooting for you to break up/get dumped?", "This is the worst thing about this sub. People will extrapolate from one tiny thing to advising divorces and going NC with families. \n\nJust hope people are taking these comments with a grain of salt.", "I would be amused to learn that her natural look is courtesy of\u2026 makeup. I agree it likely wasn\u2019t intentionally malicious but a good rule of thumb is not to tell someone publicly they look weird, especially if they can\u2019t address the weirdness immediately.", "My Aunt used to say we don't sweat we glisten.", "For real, other people look awesome... I look like a clown lol", "And I\u2019m general maybe don\u2019t tell someone they look bad if they\u2019re not in a place where they can adjust. Whether it be clothes, makeup, whatever", "He couldn't control his expression when he saw her, but it would be sooooo easy to play it off as \"I've never seen you with make-up before, you look stunning\" or something to that effect.\n\nEveryone looks strange with heavy makeup on if you are not used to seeing them with it, but it is a nornal thing to do for a wedding. You wouldn't tell your bride \"wow, you look strange with such a big gown on\" because they are wearing a wedding dress they usually wouldn't wear.", "OP called her his fiancee in the post title. bro still hasn't realized she's his wife", "I hope she annuls the marriage bc wtf\u2026 this is gonna be the start of more issues down the road", "FOREVER FOREVER FOREVER ^^FOREVER ^^FOREVER ^^EVER ^^EVER ^^EVER ^^EVER\n\n\n\n**FOREVER**", "its aita, do you really expect the stories to be real?", "I'm wearing those right now, is that weird?", "\u201cI mean, it wasn\u2019t BAD I guess.

She hated it and didn't do it for the wedding. Instead my sister just helped with some light make-up and she looked like her usual amazing self.", "Wedding makeup is pretty much exactly the same as stage makeup, it looks good under harsh lighting and in photographs but it can be pretty jarring in person, especially if you\u2019re not used to seeing that person look like that. It almost doesn\u2019t look real. Of course keeping your trap shut would be the right move here, but I understand his perspective.", "Good idea in theory, but who\u2019s to say he\u2019d be any different this time ?

I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re just really used to make up, or I\u2019m hyper sensitive to it, or what is is, but \u201cnatural look\u201d make up often looks so obvious and fake to me. You can literally see that they don\u2019t have natural skin, not to mention the rest.\n\nI was on an eyelash extension subreddit a while back and you\u2019d get women with really obvious extensions saying \u201cI asked for a natural look and this is what I got\u201d, with loads of comments telling them not to worry it looks completely natural\u2026 I had to leave that sub aha.", "Over the years, my husband has given me:\n\nA vacuum cleaner\nAn electric toothbrush\nA wheelbarrow\nA gardening fork and spade\nAn air fryer\nNew bedsheets\nNew saucepans/baking pans/cutlery \n\nHis default is to remember something that I've said *the house* needs and get me that, so now I just have an amazon wishlist.

It's not that they're rude but I look different and it takes a second to process it. I was at a nice dinner with my friend and her family so I was dressed up and wearing makeup. I wasn't wearing my glasses and her 8 year old daughter asked me to put them on because I looked so different to normal and it was freaking her out lol. I have friends who wear makeup every day and if they don't for one day, they say their colleagues will ask them if they're sick lol.", "This is the most insane stuff I've read in a while. The guy was clumsy sure, but now he's being condemned as an abuser. Some people need to touch grass.", "That's half of the comments on this sub.
