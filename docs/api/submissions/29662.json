Is there a reason he could not visit for 2 years, and he wants them in his state instead of yours. If so then changing the parenting plan is simple enough especially if your not objecting to the change and jsut saying you want it done through the courts so its all above board and recorded. Which I would definately want myself.", "Nope, NTA. The second he started calling you names, that should have been the end of the conversation. I had a similar deal with my daughter\u2019s father, and there\u2019s a REASON you have sole custody, and I absolutely would be afraid he\u2019s going to try to kidnap them if you let him take them. Then you\u2019ll be in another state, and that can REALLY complicate custody issues. He\u2019s probably planning on \u2018giving\u2019 the kids to his mom or something to raise and thinking not only would he no longer have to pay support, but he could get YOU to have to pay HIM. DO NOT trust this man, and do not let him abuse you to try to manipulate you. And you know what? It\u2019s none of his business if you date anyone or not, and it\u2019s also your business whether or not you introduce anyone to your kids. I guarantee he\u2019s seen people! Stick to your court arrangement (anything outside of that leaves you defenseless), and do not let him talk to you like that. The second he starts, you end the conversation. You can\u2019t give proven assholes like that the benefit of the doubt or anything! Stand strong, mama!\n\nNot to mention, what child is going to want to be sent to another state to stay with basically a stranger they haven\u2019t seen in two years? Much less an autistic child, because routine is SO important. He\u2019s not thinking of the children, for sure. Don\u2019t trust him!", "Your kids are 7 and 4, and their dad hasn't seen them in person in over 2 years because he doesn't want to travel for visitation? Is that correct? Does he do video or audio calls? \n\nIf not,  it sounds like he doesn't want to put out any effort to maintain a relationship with his sons. I would be wary of sending kids that young away from me to stay with someone you can't trust. NTA.", "NTA. If he's that insistent on seeing his kids, he can go through the courts. Based on his behaviour during your relationship and his reaction, you made the right choice. Plus, travel like that is stressful for a normal person, let alone an autistic child.", "NTA\n\n>He proceeded to called me a bitch and a whore saying I was parading men through my house to make the boys forget him.\n\nApparently he hasn't changed. At all. Getting the boys sent to him is all about what's easiest for him, not about what's best for anyone. Given his attack and his threats to kidnap them I would not send them anywhere with him without a court order.\n\nKeep keeping those kiddos safe. You're doing the hardest, most thankless job, as a single mom and it sounds like you're doing a damn fine job watching over their interests.", "NTA\n\nI'm all for doing what you can to have a good parenting relationship, but in this case, sending the boys off is probably a really bad idea. I'm not sure how your autistic son does with change like this, but mine would have a really hard time. \n\nI also don't like his saying you need to send them there so you can have a break. The implication is that you can't handle the kids alone so the games continue. \n\nDo not deviate from the parenting plan. If he thinks it's a good idea to have the boys sent to him, he can go tell the judge why. \n\nI'd also suggest that you make him stick to written communication with you so you have a record of his behavior, like calling you a bitch.", "NTA based on your ex's history and past threats.", "You literally answered your own question. Hes still abusive to you and weaponizing your children. NTA", "Nope, NTA. Your kids' needs come first, and I honestly have doubts that he would be in any position to satisfy them anyway since he hasn't seen them in 2 years and one is neurospicy. Given his previous threat to take them  from you, I would be hesitant too. He could say you gave him custody when you sent them to him to validate not sending them back. Nope, if he doesn't like it, then he needs to take it up through the courts.", "NTA - at this point his kids are forgetting him because of his actions.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t changed, is just looking to blame you.\nAlways follow the parenting plan AND you open yourself up to a ton of risk sending them to another state/jurisdiction without the protection of the parenting plan.\n\nJust don\u2019t respond to him unless it\u2019s something to do with your kids (within the boundaries of the parenting plan). \n\n\u201cVisitation is X only; let me know when you\u2019d like to set something up.\u201d", "NTA you have a legal agreement that he can either comply with or try to change through legal channels. Nothing else is up for debate. And I'd fight him if he tried to change it given what you've said about his emotional abuse.", "NTA- Please continue protecting and caring for your kids the way you are now", "Time to let the courts know that the sperm donor has been failing to utilize his custody time and you want the parenting plan to change to reflect this- child support included. NTA", "NTA\n\nWhile you have custody, you also have a court-established visitation order. Follow the order. If he wants the order changed, he needs to go back to court to have that done.", "NTA\n\n\nTechnically it\u2019s not even your decision. You are legally required to follow the court order.", "Nope nta. You have a court order, it's not a casual suggestion", "Different states and possession is 9/10ths of the law.  If he gets them and keeps them then you would have to get a lawyer and sue him for custody in his state.  It would take years.", "NTA\n\n>called me a bitch and a whore\n\nHe\u2019s still trying to emotionally manipulate you and mess with your head. \n\nDefinitely don\u2019t send the kids to him - he sounds vindictive and dangerous. He may keep the kids out of spite until the law steps in just to keep messing with your head.\n\nIf, by some miracle, does actually come to your state, I wouldn\u2019t let him have unsupervised visits either, if possible.", "NTA \n\nonce he played the \u201cyou\u2019re not doing what I want so I\u2019m going to degrade and attack you\u201d card, his wishes were off the table IMO.", "NTA. Especially not considering his reaction to a reasonable request. Your reasons for being wary are solid, especially if he's threated to kidnap the kids before.", "NTA.  The courts awarded you sole custody for a reason, and getting them back could be a nightmare if he doesn't cooperate when it's time to return.  He has a legal path to see his kids, it's on him to utilize it.", "NTA the fact that he instantly called you names after not getting what he wants demonstrates why he shouldn't get the kids", "NTA you were given the control you currently have for a reason. He needs to follow the court order or make the effort to show that the court should modify. If he doesn\u2019t care enough to do that? I don\u2019t think he has good intentions.", "Don't do it.  Trust your instincts.  NTA", "Nope. NTA.  I\u2019m would never send my children to see a \u201cfather\u201d that hasn\u2019t bothered to see them in 2 years and has threatened to run away with them. \n\nHe wants it so bad let him go back to court.  Court will laugh at him because he has made no effort to the children. \n\nNTA for keeping your kids safe.", "NTA. Follow the court orders to the exact letter. And, when he complains, repeat your previous statement- \u201cI will follow the orders from the judge. If you\u2019d like the kids to come to you, take it up with your attorney and the courts.\u201d Lastly, if he does go to the judge, be sure to ask him to produce all the evidence that he\u2019s bothered to use the time he\u2019s already been awarded to be with his kids.", "NTA he is abusive and there is no way that I would send my kids away with someone who is virtually a stranger since they have not seen him in 2 years. Then he has in the past threatened to run with them....Girl no....just noooooo!", "Hell no, NTA", "NTA.", "It sounds like it's best for *them* not to be with him.\n\nNTA", "Nta", "NTA, and good for you for putting your children first. You are an outstanding mom in difficult circumstances.\n\nHe wants to see them, well, there is a written plan in place to make that happen. He wants to change the plan? See you in court!", "Absolutely NTA, and if he does try to go through the courts, I would tell the judge about his threat. When I was a kid, two kids I went to school with were the subject of custodial interference by their father. Their parents were going through a nasty divorce, and during his visitation period, their dad tried to sneak them out of the country to make it impossible for their mother to get them back. Fortunately, he was caught on the way to the airport. If your ex has already threatened to abscond with your kids, this is not something I would take lightly!", "Stick to the court order or the court order will be changed to reflect what you have allowed. NTA", "NTA \n\nIf you send them you will never see them again. He can file in his state that you abandoned them.", "It sounds like your kids are high needs. What is your Plan B for their care if something happened to you. With the relationship severed the father may no longer inclined to step in. If there are alternative carers than it is really up to you.", "NTA.\n\nHe hasn't bothered to see his kids in 2 years, and now he wants you to send them to another state for a week?! First of all, he knows what your custody/visitation agreement says, and that what he's asking for is well beyond what was agreed to.\n\nSecondly, after not seeing him for two years, he's basically a stranger to your children.  You do not send young children to stay with a stranger in another state. I don't know what he's trying to pull, but it's clear that it's not for the benefit if yyou or your children.", "NTA. If I were in your shoes, I'd stop communicating directly with him. Let everything go through your lawyer. It sounds to me like he's up to some funny business.", "NTA- \" At one point threatened to run away with the boys while I was at work.\"\n\nYeah if your ex wants something to change he needs to take it to court.  That is not a threat you make, or take, lightly.", "NTA. Trust your gut.", "If this is how he speaks to you, you need a lawyer more than you need reddit. Document *everything*. Somebody who calls you those things should not have unsupervised contact with your children at all if possible.\n\nNTA.", "ESH your ex sounds like a piece of work, no doubt about that. But you need to understand that his behaviour towards you is not a reflection of his behaviour towards the kids. The children are entitled to a relationship with their father and  if he\u2019s keen on one than you should be doing your best to help facilitate it. Maybe I\u2019m missing something but I fail to see the difference with you letting him see the kids in your state or his state, they\u2019re just imaginary lines on a map. Seems if it wasn\u2019t for the courts you wouldn\u2019t allow your kids any time with their father which isn\u2019t the way to go unless he\u2019s abusive towards THEM.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You may need them got the court.", "NTA and your husband just proved why it's not a good idea to let those boys out of the state.", "NTA.  **You have the custody for many excellent reasons, but mostly because you are protecting them** from being put into an abusive situation, with their only parent someone that threatened to take them away from their security, you.  \n\n**Your ex is still trying to mess with your thoughts, and emotionally abuse you.**  Your kids aren't old enough to go to a police station on their own and tell the police they were taken away from you illegally.  They are not old enough to tell authorities if your ex or his relatives abuse them emotionally or verbally.  **They need your protection.**  \n\nI've heard that there are aps you can use that will record all the things your ex says to you, when you discuss custody and visits, so you have proof for court that you offer visits and how he treats you when he doesn't get his way.  \n\nStart to say things like \"I'm not discussing this again.\"  \"Was there anything else?  No, okay, bye.\" You don't have to listen to his abuse.", "The answer is 'perhaps'.  It can be rather difficult to travel for visitation.  The cost is likely thousands per visit.  For some, that could make it prohibitive.   Your ex should not strike out at you when he doesn't get his way and I can see where trust would be gone.  On the other hand, if you do everything you can do to avoid giving him time with the boys, you might be the AH.  Or maybe not.", "NTA and those texts as well as the fact he's not used visitation in over two years will be excellent evidence for court to demonstrate why he should no longer be allowed to contact you OR have custody. This is clearly another plot to emotionally abuse you from afar and if this person was interested in their children or giving you a break they'd abide by the court-ordered rules and come to see them.", "I bet he tried to talk to a lawyer and got told that since he hasn't taken his visitation in two years, there's no way in hell the order is getting changed so that OP has to send their kids to him for visitation. At the very least, OP can get some sort of local step-up plan or ordered reunification therapy before the order changes.\n\nConvincing OP to do that instead, is an end-runaround court. If she does it, he can then take the evidence of THAT to court and say \"see! OP did it! It's now status quo so order it!\"", "That is correct. He has video chatted maybe once every 6-8 months when he feels like it.", "That is all we do. I learned from our marriage to only have written communication between us. Between emails and texts that is the only way the two of us communicate. He will video call the boys maybe once every 6-8 months.", "Oooo! Yes, having him use written communication is a really good idea.", "I love the term neurospicy :)", "Or rather his inaction. If they were really that important to him he'd come to the state OP lives in as per the conditions of the visitation, but the best he manages is a video call every 6-8 months.", "Read the post more carefully. Visitations are in her state because of disability. \nPlus, this is the court decision and, since the boys are minors, they could seriously get in trouble if something goes wrong.", "Uh idk what you\u2019re reading? If it doesn\u2019t matter what state then why hasn\u2019t dad ever tried to visit them either?\n\nAnd what do you mean if it wasn\u2019t for the courts?

Even when we were together he would choose video gaming (nothing wrong with gaming just priorities) over parenting. He claimed our youngest isn\u2019t his, because he was born bald and blonde while our oldest looks like his daughter (from another mother, who he also abandoned, before we were together) dark full head of hair. As well as tried to claim nothing was wrong with our oldest and that he was progressing normally even though he wasn\u2019t talking until after he was 4. Just a few of the instances where his behaviors weren\u2019t healthy toward the boys. He also threatened suicide when I tried to leave him the first time. So there\u2019s that as well.", "We only speak through text or emails.", "So no relationship to speak of, then. The 4 year old might not even recognize him if he saw him in person. \"Dad\" has another agenda for wanting you to send them to him and I would keep them far, far away from him.", "Lmao this reminded me of how my dad would call me and my siblings a few times a year but wouldn't want to do supervised visitation for \"reasons\". Anyways he's been dead for 10 years now and I barely have any memories of him being a dad.", "Me too. I have autism and adhd so i got the whole package pretty much. Btw, your ex can fuck right off and you're nta! :)", "I understand that\u2019s the reason stated on the custody order, but young disabled children are physically able to cross state lines. I would have thought if both parents consented that it wouldn\u2019t be an issue, but if you\u2019re saying that the court order prevents the children from being taken interstate then fair enough.", "Ok honey do you have anyone in real life that you can talk to about this? Who can actually assure you that this man has no business being around you or your kids? Because he\u2019s clearly got under your skin somehow and us strangers online can only validate you from afar.

I agree it\u2019s shitty he hasn\u2019t seen his kids in 2 years but why is it sus he wants them to visit in his home state? The visits aren\u2019t supervised regardless of location so if he had I\u2019ll intentions they can just as easily occur in either state, no?", "Ok I have to ask, do YOU genuinely think you could possibly be the asshole?

There's also the issue that once she's sent the kids over, if he doesn't want to return them it would make recovering the children exponentially harder. And there's the fact that one of the kids is autistic. Autistic people have a lot harder of a time adjusting to changes in routine than \"normal\" people do, so it would be causing harm to the child. There are multiple reasons why giving in to this request is a bad idea.", "Very true"]}
