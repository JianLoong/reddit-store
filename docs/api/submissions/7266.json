People who cheat are taking advantage of everyone else.", "NTA, a lot of people saying that you are, are referencing the fact that this doesn't directly impact you. I don't know how the class that you're in words, but many classes grade on a curve, that means the more people getting higher scores the more the instructor takes away to force a curve. Not only that, most colleges have an honor code that you sign, that code typically says that not only will you not cheat, but that if you are aware of cheating you will bring it to the attention of the college. You would be impacting yourself by not doing that, knowing yourself to be someone who keeps their word, if you fail to report on an honor code that you signed, there would be an impact on you.", "NTA. People don't have some sort of natural right to privacy when cheating.", "NTA. If they were too stupid to hide their cheating better, they're too stupid to pass. If you do something out in the open, you take the risk of being reported. They can consider this their welcome into the real world.", "NTA\n\nI totally get your frustration, cheating is not fair to anyone around you, including those girls.

Also, for those saying it doesn't affect her, a lot of tests in college are graded on a curve, so if a student gets an inflated score due to cheating, it can affect everyone else's final grade.", "NTA.

Would either of these girls be the girl you called out for \"cheating\" on the icebreaker for the same class?", "Technically NTA, but how does this effect you at all? Your grade isn\u2019t affected by her doing good or bad. And why were you paying so much attention to everyone else and not focused on your own test.

These girls failing or succeeding doesn't change anything for you. You will get the same grade. I feel like that's a pretty immature reaction. Just mind your own business, let people cheat if they feel like it, as long as it doesn't take anything from you, why would you even care?", "Yeah a little. Stop being petty. You\u2019re an adult now. If she cheats she WILL get caught out someone one day. But it\u2019s none of your business esp if it\u2019s not actually harming you.", "Ahaha yeah YTA, I'm pretty she won't be the first or the last but I mean if you're worried doubt she'll find out it was you\n\nAlso I can't tell you the # of people I know who got their degrees by cheating during those online exams and are thriving in the workforce no different than high-school", "I mean NTA cause they cheated but seriously \ud83e\udd23? Why were you looking everywhere but your own test? Worry about you instead of everyone else and you wouldn't have known.", "Technically you didn\u2019t do anything wrong but it\u2019s none of your business. That\u2019s very childish for a 19yo", "YTA\n\nI completely understand why you would feel disappointed that someone else had it easier than you in the test, but that is no justification for snitching on your batchmates. Whatever they did should not affect you in any manner and you could simply continue with your work rather than making life difficult for them. \n\nSnitching on your fellows might sound reasonable to you right now but in the long run it is going to erode the trust that a batch should have within itself and complete erode the fabric that binds you together. In the future when there are batch parties or other social gatherings, it is highly unlikely that anyone would want to invite you over because of this act of yours.", "[removed]", "YTA", "YTA. Why is it your business if she is cheating? She isn\u2019t cheating off you so who cares.", "YTA. None of what they were doing had any affect on your performance. I'm assuming this is a baaic college level course so odds are its a compulsory class they may not pertain to their degree. Or they could just not give a shit. Either way, yta.", "YTA.", "YTA worry about yourself", "YTA had nothing to do with you so why put yourself in their busines? You never know what is going on in someone's life could have been a very good reason she couldn't study and needed her friends help.", "YTA it\u2019s none of your business how others treat their education", "YTA. The two of them doing this in no way impacts you. It's the professor's job to watch out for this, not yours", "Tough one.  My first thought is\n\nYTA because running to professor and being a tattletale is not an honorable thing, especially when you are assuming you saw what you did, and didn't misinterpret the facts.\n\nStill, it's maddening to have studied and worked so hard to do well on the exam while others cheat their way through.  But remember that your hard work will stand on its own and you will do well because of your efforts.  Cheaters, on the other hand, rarely do well because they don't learn and absorb the information.  And they tend to repeat those behaviors throughout life.\n\nThe professor also needs to make sure phones are not present and that the group is monitored properly.", "YTA. Mind your own fucking business. It\u2019ll catch up to her eventually.", "tldr: you might be right, but so was a girl in my year. It did not stop her from being ostracized, and put a damper on her college career and our first job out of college. \n\n\nWe had a girl like you in my year. (Accounting majors usually end up in a group as you go thru the classes). She wasn\u2019t very popular with the group (about 50 or so at the beginning of freshman year) after she told on a person using their phone. In one of the mgmt classes it was in an auditorium and we used laptops. The class was impossible to pass and eventually went away but we still had to take it. Someone started a Facebook group and added everyone in the class except her. She was 1 of 3 people that failed the test and her gpa took a hit. Later in an accounting class we had the option of group or solo. It was one of those projects where you have to balance the books and make Finanial statements.  Obviously she was solo because no one wanted to work with her. All of the groups made a GroupMe and we traded answers and helped each other out, again everyone but her. The majority of the class got high A\u2019s and I think she ended up with a B or something.\n\nI say all this because you may have the moral high ground. But if it ever comes out that you are the snitch, the chances of you being included in future collaboration are going to be small. Also, my opinion of the girl was that she was uptight, unfriendly, and stuck up. Generally not someone I want to spend time with. We ended up at the same Big 4 firm and she had a really hard time the first year and was eventually sent to a different department before being let go right before we made Senior. The biggest complaint was that she wasn\u2019t a team player. Example everyone would stay late to work. If you didn\u2019t have work to do you picked up someone else\u2019s section and continue working. She didn\u2019t like that, and all of her teams hated her because they thought she was selfish. \n\nJust keep these kind of things in mind. You maybe absolutely be correct morally, but sometimes that doesn\u2019t translate into real life, and it won\u2019t stop people for snubbing you if the think your the high and mighty type.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Another instance was another girl made flash cards online for studying (quizme) and sent the link to everyone in the class. The snitch (let\u2019s call her Beth) reported her as well. Nothing happened because it wasn\u2019t cheating, but as a result more people didn\u2019t want to be bothered with her. Every time Beth did something new her reputation continued to take a hit. She was and is entitled to follow whatever moral or ethical ideas she subscribed to. Just as everyone else is entitled to do the same. There was no pow wow where everyone else was just like fuck this girl. Her own behaviors lead to her being left out and as a result, yes, she may not have learned how to be a team player, but this is where personal accountability comes into play. She had the same classes, same opportunities, and even got into the same firm as me, but her reputation and actions caused her own downfall. That\u2019s not my responsibility however to teach her.  Also,  I don\u2019t believe you have to lower or abandon your ethical or moral standards to be successful. But you do have to learn to work with others when you are not self employed. To pretend otherwise is going to be detrimental. No one likes a snitch. No one is going to include her or OP if they become a threat because of the moral obligations.

At the state university where I teach, I've often had several students come to me for recommendation letters for the same position or scholarship--to become an RA, for example, or to get into an elite fraternity/sorority.  This puts them in direct competition with each other.  I'll write letters for all the students who ask, but their course grades play into what I say in the letters.  In that kind of situation--very common at my school--then yes, if one student's grade is artificially inflated by cheating, it could directly impact her.\n\nI didn't get into this, but cheaters in the classroom also decrease the value of the OP's education.

Over time, that means that graduates from the college get a reputation for less competency (and likely for poor ethics--they were okay with lying about their work, after all).  So if ABC State University has a cheating problem, then ABC State graduates will eventually be known as folks who don't have the basic skills that ABC said they would have as graduates.\n\nThis means that if I'm hiring and I have two candidates who look good... one from ABC State and the other from XYZ State, and I have experience with ABC State students as being incompetent (as they never really learned their coursework) and unethical (as they were totally fine with cheating their way through school--why would it suddenly stop afterward?), then I'm going to hire the person from XYZ State and hope that their standards were better than ABC's.", "Not everyone in the big 4 are psychopaths.

(That is, classes where the students weren't necessarily interested in the subject, but needed to fulfill an educational requirement for graduation.)  One professor would even make 4 different versions of an exam (same questions, short answer, but each version with different ordering) so that no student was taking the same test as those immediately in front, behind, or in the adjacent rows.

Nobody in the class seems to like or want to talk to me and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair.\n\nAt the beginning of the term a few months ago, we had to get in a circle and go around and introduce ourselves. After the first person went, the teacher said that we had to repeat the names of everyone who went before us. I was excited, because I live for this kind of stuff. When it got to me, I happily named everyone in the class.\n\nBut then, it was the next girls\u2019 turn. She started off by saying in a soft voice, \u201cWell, I actually wrote the names all down because I have a hard time with these kinds of things.\u201d I was so mad because yes it\u2019s challenging, but that\u2019s the point. How was she gonna learn anyone\u2019s name if she just read it off a paper?\n\nI yelled at her, \u201cWHAT THE HELL? THAT\u2019S CHEATING! I DON\u2019T GIVE A RAT\u2019S ASS IF YOU \u2018HAVE A HARD TIME\u2019 WE\u2019RE ALL DOING THIS FAIRLY!\u201d The professor told me to calm down, and said it wasn\u2019t a big deal since this was just a \u201cget to know everyone\u201d activity, but I told her that yes, it was a big deal. The professor unkindly rolled her eyes at me. I continued yelling at said girl and she said she needed to go to the bathroom. She apparently cried which was stupid. My professor then said it was time to do something else. But ever since then, whenever I attend the class no one will sit with me. It\u2019s rude and impolite since I was just teaching her about the immorality of cheating.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m in the right here, but I have to ask: Reddit, AITA?\n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The professor would probably make that the new 100%, and everyone else would've been raised up to match proportional to what the highest score got (35% would become 50% because it's half of the highest grade).\n\nBut if these girls who cheated ended up with a 90%, it would screw the curve, because then someone with a 45% would be considered the new 50% instead.
