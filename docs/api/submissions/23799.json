Somehow, I'm thinking if he had time for a commentary, this is how it played out.", "NTA. People will hate on you if you have made a scene or told him calmly or were mad at him or didn't do anything.

Mike is a lot worse than he seems, I think.", "NTA. Your friend is directing her anger at the wrong person.", "You do realize his behavior while drunk might be an indicator of what he thinks while sober?

Celia's anger was definitely misplaced, as the inappropriate behavior was from her spouse.\n\nThat being said? Your excusing the action and then doubling down because \"he's drunk\" was reprehensible. If he'd assaulted you further, would you still excuse it? Why ? He's just drunk, right? \n\nYour lack of response could easily have been attributed to shock/trauma, but you doubled down and openly excused it. THAT is why you are also an asshole.", "Who the fuck lifts peoples skirts up or pants down as a joke? Grow the fuck up.", "NTA.

Something happened that violated you but it also caught you off guard. You were able to rationalize that this person was your friend and they're intoxicated. If it were a stranger - I would expect a different reaction. Celia's anger and jealousy is directed at the wrong person.", "NTA. \n\nBlaming OP who is the actual victim in this scenario for her reaction is fucking stupid. She had the right to react however she wanted. \n\nMike was wrong and the AH.

Maybe the husband has said something to Celia about finding you attractive. She could be feeling the husband is acting on those feelings by looking up your skirt. You downplaying his awful behaviour sends message to her that you are amenable this roving hands.\n\nNone of this is your problem of course. Celia has the disease of many wives;blame everyone but the sh*t husband then you don't have to deal with his bad behaviour", "NTA\n\nYou reacted how you wanted to.

I have a feeling something of this nature has happened to you before.", "NTA your boundaries got violated, and you\u2019re getting blamed for how you reacted?

You should have tried to keep him from pulling the dress up but you didn't so you are just as bad as he is.  He needs to apologize to you and his wife for his drunken behavior.\n\nEdited from NTA to ESH because she didn't care based on him being drunk and using that as an excuse is like saying boys will be boys", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He was inappropriate with you. You could have shamed and embarrassed him (I would have) but chose not to. I would say if he feels comfy doing that then he\u2019s not very faithful to his wife.

You don\u2019t have to tell us, but check in with yourself and see how you\u2019re feeling about your friend\u2019s husband violating you in public.

The best thing you could have done under the circumstances was not make a fuss and that\u2019s what you did (or didn\u2019t) do. I think your friends anger is misplaced. She\u2019s angry with her husband and putting it onto you.\nThat being said, I don\u2019t buy the argument that he did this just because he was really drunk. Or maybe I should say it can\u2019t be excused just because he was really drunk. Celia needs to deal with her husband and I suspect she will let him have it.", "NTA, you were put on the spot by him and tried to handle it on the fly as best as you could. Celia is angry at the wrong person, or she might be suspecting that he at best has a wandering eye and is taking that out on you.\n\nThat being said, I wouldnt brush this off as someone being a silly drunk. A grown man pulled up your dress at a party to comment on your underwear and laugh about it with other people. He might have been drunk, and you might socialice in different ways than I'm used to, but I personally wouldnt see those actions as no big deal.

Make sure this is a group text so both of them see exactly what is being said. Take your time with it too. Gotta wonder what else mike does when drinking. There\u2019s no excuse for what he did.

If she makes it your fault, she doesn\u2019t have to accept the reality that her husband sexually assaulted you in front of others.

But what he did to you was not your fault in any way, shape or form.\n\nYour friend's projection of her anger at her husband's behaviour onto you was NOT acceptable. Please avoid both of them going forward.

You handled it with grace and humor.", "NTA.\n\nFirst, sexual harassment is a big deal.

This is a grown-ass man here, not a twelve year old boy ate up with the horny.\n\nMakes me wonder a lot about their relationship behind closed doors. I suspect there is some bad behavior on his part.

Fucking boundaries are a thing!!!!", "Your friends husband wants to mate with you and your friend noticed and got upset and humiliated and blamed you. It's not fair or logical, but she was probably just super sad about marrying that dude. Plus if she yelled at you she wouldn't have to yell at her drunk husband who would have probably made things way worse. So really you did your friend a huge favor by letting her yell at you. Also maybe be really careful around drunk Mike.", "NTA. \n\nBut your best friend, her husband, and every person in this thread explaining to you how you're supposed to react to being violated is. \n\nYes, this thread is for opinions, but there are some things that you don't get to call someone an asshole for, and one of those things is whether or not someone acted \"victimized enough\" after something like this.", "NTA.

Celia seems like she has much deeper issues she needs to address with Mike.", "You were actually very considerate and tactful.", "In vino veritas", "Hmmmmm", "NTA\nSometimes people freeze in uncomfortable situations. Just to let you know it wasn't ok he did that to you. Your friend should have focused on her husband being a gross guy.", "NTA.

Besides if you had I doubt very much her reaction would have been any different and likely a lot more hostile towards you for making it a big deal and for embarrassing him, and of course her. \n\nWhich is the cause of her reaction. She is embarrassed and shamed, and does not want to blame him, so she blames you.", "NTA but you should have smacked the shit out of him...", "NTA\n\nSomething was done to you without consent that was a violation and a surprise.

Which is made worse by you not isn't tly scorning his drunken advance, from her perspective.\n\nI would likely try to reframe being drunk though. It's not an excuse for bad behavior. I dont think you should brush that stuff off so easily but that is a you thing.", "NTA. Drunk BF and his girl are.", "NTA.  HE assaulted you and you are in the wrong? It sounds like there may be trouble in their relationship and this one episode took her over the edge. \n\nI would bring it up with her when you both are sober and see how she reacts.  If she is still blaming you, that would make me end the relationship.  It is obviously Mike's fault and they both owe you an apology.", "If he'll do that drunk, he probably thinks along the same lines when he's sober.  He's a closet jerk.", "Your friend is mad at you because it will be no good yelling at her ass of a husband...  I would however tell him when he's sober, that you didn't find it funny and to keep his piggish hands off of you", "NTA\n\nDrunk people are fools and act it. I would have done the same in drunken company because getting upset can turn the vibe from happy drunk to angry drunk in the blink of an eye and angry drunks are dangerous.", "NTA, it shouldn\u2019t have happened and you handled it how you felt most comfortable with. If she was bothered then as your friend of 10 years she should have corrected her husbands behavior. The vibe I\u2019m getting is she wouldn\u2019t have been pleased with you regardless of how you responded.", "NTA.  You handled it well, joked about it instead of making a scene.  She should be thankful you are still speaking to her and him, but instead she yelled at you.  She owes you a giant apology and he owes you one as well.", "NTA - that honor belongs to your best friend and her boyfriend. However, you might want to think twice about saying things like \"he's completely drunk so it's no big deal.\" There are plenty of people who can come up with plenty of justifications for sexually inappropriate behavior, they don't need help or reinforcement from you and the next girl they do this (or worse) to might think it's a very big deal.", "NTA.  You laughed it off to not call attention to it & make it a big deal bc you knew he was just drunk.  You have no blame here.", "NTA, but I can see why your friend is upset she might be misunderstanding you and thinking your both attracted to each other. For people saying she shouldn\u2019t be mad at you but her husband they don\u2019t know if she already talked to her husband about it or not. I personally would cause a big deal with my husband if he did something like that and apologize to my friend for his behaviour.", "mike is a creeper. nta", "As you literally stated, this was something to talk about while being SOBER.\nI just think you did perfectly well\n\nNTA", "NTA. I seriously commend you for staying so calm.\n\nPersonally, had anyone lifted my short dress to comment on my underwear, I would have boxed him right in the danglies, until they looked like a pair of coconuts.\n\nOn the other hand, had I been Celia, I would not have blamed my friend, but my disrespectful, unfaithful husband, who obviously has roving eyes and wandering hands. Drunk or not makes no difference to me. I would re-evaluate my relationship and would probably opt for divorce at some stage. Cheating is a definite dealbreaker for me.", "Ok this behaviour is never ok so I wouldn\u2019t laugh it off. In vino veritas: people show us who they are when alcohol lowers their inhibitions. However, your friend should be taking this out on her AH husband not you.", "NTA. I personally would have slapped the sh!t out of him, don't care if he's drunk or not, but that's just me. As for you friend, I would have told her if she has a problem with what happened and how I reacted maybe she should get a better hold of her husband. Or, would she have preferred I slapped him and made a scene? If, even in his drunken state, he's fine doing that to a friend, would that stop him from doing it when they're out and about and he does it to a stranger?", "NTA. Wow. Way to project, Celia. Celia sucks and even if he was drunk, her husband sucks too.", "NTA- you went out of your way to not make a scene and keep this from becoming some big 'event'. Her anger needed to be directed at her husband.", "NTA - but what the fuck kind of friends see that happen in front of them and don't do anything?", "For clarification, was he the only one doing it, or were your other friends doing it as well.", "And like...had she reacted differently and yelled at him ect who's to say the friend wouldn't have gotten pissy for embarrassing her ect", "Celia has every right to be upset, but certainly not with OP. If my partner were violating others, drunk or not, he would be going home and I would be questing if I was going to join, ever again.", "I don't think Celia is Jealous just angry and she wanted Op to be just as Angry.", "And even then being drunk isn\u2019t an excuse for what he did. So blaming her is even more fucking stupid because he should know better drunk or not. When me and my partner drink I set the boundary that we can\u2019t consent while drunk so no sex. And I hold myself to that no matter how much I want to when I\u2019m drunk because I know better. I hate seeing other women try to tear us down defending the inappropriate actions of men they\u2019re with", "Yea but you don't get at the victim for how she reacts, you get at the guy who lifted the skirt", "Yeah same. Maybe Celia thinks it\u2019s weird the OP wasnt more appalled by this behavior, which was pretty violating. OP seemed oddly chill about it.", "NTA, but Celia is an AH. I wouldn't check in until she apologizes. How dare she have a go at the victim Instead of her husband who's committed assault", "And given his behaviour, she is most likely right :)", "I too suspect Celia's husband of cheating. And also just being a shitty, boundary-stomping person. Being drunk doesn't change your personality, it just removes inhibitions.", "How is stepping away, and pulling your dress down while saying \u201cwoah!\u201d not considered an appropriate reaction here? \n\nSo lost in this thread", "Right?!  Honestly I'm impressed with OP's composure!  If they'd yelled at him in the moment a) they probably wouldn't have gotten a good reaction or apology from him because he was too drunk to think rationally, and then b) if they'd tried to then follow up when he was sober, I bet he/others would say \"why are you bringing it up again??  You already yelled at me/him!\"\n\nBy waiting to deal with it until he's sober, OP can collect their thoughts to deliver some searing criticism of his behavior.  They can also better determine if he's giving a genuine apology and won't do it again.  And if they do decide to cut him off, it'll be for his sober reaction/behavior, so people can't criticism them \"because he was drunk, it's just a joke!!\"", "This!", "Alcohol is not a scapegoat or to blame. Plenty of people get drunk and manage not to sexually assault their friends or be assholes.", "That's not exactly what I said but I wasn't talking in english. I was meaning \"let's see how he reacts when he gets sober and I tell him what he did\" and it was pretty clear that's what I meant.", "No, she is not supposed to control her man.  He is supposed to control himself.  Spouses, SOs, boyfriends/girlfriends are not tasked with controlling their partners, who are presumably/hopefully fully-functioning adults.", "It's her body. She can respond however she wants to. Calling her an asshole because she wasn't traumatized by the event is cringe. The only person at fault is Celia's Husband.", "I wouldn't say that I allowed it, I was caught by surprise. If he had asked me I would have obviously never agreed or allowed it.", "I can understand that. Still I feel like her comment about me \"liking it\" was kinda inappropriate.", "Wtf did I just read? OP is as bad as Mike the dress lifter? Saying the SA / assault victim is to blame? This is why so many r a p e victims don\u2019t report the crime, they are afraid that they will be judged as the one at fault, blamed for it happening. I can\u2019t believe that Patient_Gas could actually type this BS.", "Am I illiterate or did you say OP is just as bad as Mike?", "Why is she TA here?", "This is beyond ridiculous. Women have to laugh when they are casually assaulted in that manner.

You are NTA.\n\nAnd I agree with the other comments about how if you had reacted more intensely in the moment you would have been blamed for causing a scene.\n\nI'm sorry to welcome you to a common blaming trap that will probably happen again, and again. Maybe learn to get good at sharp slaps on the hands? It's subtle, direct, not too scene causing, and just shocking enough to be memorable. \nBut don't do it in a flirty way, and don't giggle. \n\nAnd...I now wear shorts under all my skirts.", "Drunk or not, that shit isn't acceptable. I've been drunk around women friends often, I've never sexually assaulted one.", "Honestly, drunk or not, his behaviour was unacceptable and you should have told him off right away.

You would do well in cutting contact with both.", "Celia was embarrassed and pissed at her husband for his behavior.\n\nShe singled you out because she hadn't processed it yet.\n\nI would give her a few days and reach out.

I'm not sure how I would react if someone I was supposed to be friends with did something to me like this, it's so wholly inappropriate.  You handled this with such grace, I'm impressed.

He deserves to be yelled at when he\u2019s sober. \n\nAs for you, you should\u2019ve said something and put him in his place. I can also see why you didn\u2019t want to make a scene, but what he did was inappropriate and your mild tone makes it seem like it\u2019s ok with you that he did it.

My SIL and I are the same height, same hair color and look very similar from behind. We were all drunk at a bar and my future BIL smacked my butt, thinking it was her.

OP friend is victim blaming and she certainly wouldn\u2019t be my friend after her reaction", "Yeah I'm shocked at all these \" why didn't you\" comments- she had no idea what was about to happen and not everyone's first reaction to such an unexpected violation is physical violence, verbal dressing downs or otherwise.", "There's nothing odd about being chill in a situation like OP described. If they know this person and this isn't behavior the friend normally engage in, it's logical to not want to make a huge scene right away. Also, women endure this type of harassment from an early age and it usually never stops so it's completely reasonable that one could be desensitized to the abuse and just shrug it off as no big deal in the moment. The majority of us have experienced far worse than a drunkard lifting our skirt in public and some of us may just shrug it off.", "She's NTA for not slapping him or yelling or whatever.

(WTF)  Yes, what he did was wrong but she accepted the behavior, of course the wife blames her for it.  but yeah they all suck", "it should be edited to ESH because she made the excuse he was drunk when he did it", "I'm not saying she needed to cause a scene. You can be angry without causing a scene. \n\nShe did say she just brushed it off, which makes it sound like she wasn't fussed.", "Because she brushed it off, it\u2019s not a stranger, it\u2019s someone she knows and he was behaving badly.", "Can a woman ever take any responsibility? \n\nIf it was the other way around, then you will say the guy in an a-hole. Stop your stupid man-hating double standards.", "Disagree - OP did nothing wrong.", "Yeah and it\u2019s not an issue of being too drunk either. It\u2019s not like you reach a certain threshold and start indiscriminately sexually assaulting people. My friend drank to a point of borderline alcohol poisoning, at no point leading up to that did he suddenly turn into a young Kevin Spacey.", "I agree that his behavior was unacceptable.  But I don't think it is your place to tell OP how she should have reacted to it.", "There\u2019s no sense with arguing or \u201ctelling off\u201d an extremely drunk person. It only instigates a larger situation. OP made the right decision in the moment. Now once the dude is sobered up, that\u2019s an entirely different story.", "Reacting like that would have just drawn attention from others and, if he was really drunk, talking to him then would have been a waste of breath.\n\nOP should get an apology from both of them.", "I have learned that when dealing with drunks in the drunkest state that not escalating the situation is best & to wait until they are sober. If he was being more aggressive, then yes, having that attitude may or may not  have been best. \n\nSome discussions are best had when the person is sober; that way, they can understand their behavior & look and see if they have issues that need to be addressed about their limits.", "Why should she show/or signal that it's not OK? Is it her responsibility to make it clear to everyone that something bad is something bad... cmon", "So you think every woman who is sexually harassed like this out of nowhere has a response just cooly hanging out in the back of her head waiting to use?\nYikes man, if this happened to me I would be furious but I also would have no idea in the moment how to react- probably freeze up, which is a pretty common response.", "I was the first girl in our grade to wear a bra. The class clown, we'll call him Kenny, decided one day that it would be hilarious if he snapped my bra strap. He grabbed it, pulled on it, and just as he was letting go, I spun round and punched him directly in the eye. He yelled.

I am an anxious person, have had my fair share of bad situations with guys... and I would have awkwardly laughed it off and tried to not make a big deal about it or draw attention to myself, for fear of something worse happening. \n\nWe can always say what \\*should\\* be done, but it isn't up to the victim to react perfectly to something so unexpected, and the wife is misdirecting her anger... she should be furious at her husband for acting that way and embarrassing multiple people in one act.", "We can\u2019t predict how we react when something like this happens. If it were me I know I\u2019d just feel like dying and not call attention at that moment", "Blaming someone who is assaulted or harassed because she doesn\u2019t react the way others  think she should is exactly what victim blaming looks like.", "I\u2019m sorry, but OP literally said \u201chaha it\u2019s ok because you\u2019re just too drunk\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s not victim-blaming to wonder why she did not care.", "I feel like this is more likely to fall under sexual harassment. Aside from that, I don't get why you feel the need to speak for the \"victim\" (as you put it) here, when OP has clearly spoken for herself.", "You're absolutely right it is SA. And I also hear the reasoning of being fearful of her safety. But they were in a group, with his wife right there. Celia should never have gone off on OP. But OP should also not have excused it in this situation. She wasn't in danger, and she STILL maintains it was no big deal because he was drunk. In an anonymous online forum, in which she isn't in danger from us. That's my point. She is still blowing it off.", "I think Celia and her husband are both fucked up. OP is definitely NTA here. \n\nThat all said, I can totally see why Celia would think they were being flirty. \n\nEven if I wasn\u2019t upset or ready to make a scene, I would say \u201coop, please don\u2019t do that\u201d, and take a step or 2 away from him.", ">But the fact that I, in her own words, is saying that it's no big deal for him to behave like that \"because he's drunk\" and \"he's not usually like that\" is NOT ok\n\nIt's obviously OK for her. It's her body. She thinks he's a good guy that made a mistake, he for sure won't do it again.

She should be yelling at her disgusting bf, not her friend.", "If he assaults someone in the future, it\u2019s because *he* is an assaulter\u2014NOT because someone he SA\u2019d in the past de-escalated in a way *you* deem unfit.", "You are also a misogynist", "I call bull noone who is assaulted victim blames and in the off chance that is true, go the therapy asap", "Dude lifted up the lady\u2019s dress without consent, and commented on her underwear.

When I read what he did, it led me to believe this post was going in an entirely different direction \ud83d\ude05. NTA, your friend is though for taking it out on you like it was your fault? Him too if he doesn't own up and apologize to you. Even if your not looking for it I think he owes you one", "It's an opinion, she asked for opinion on Reddit, and she can take it or not. \n\nIf she had not had a reaction due to shock or whatever, is perfectly understandable, but she said it was not a big deal because he was drunk. She basically enabled him, so no, she should not have done that.", "This is how I felt. What if he became aggressive?", "Pretty sure little boys learn by kindergarten that is NOT OK to pull up girl\u2019s skirts.", "I\u2019m not saying her actions at the party excused him, I\u2019m saying that her wording in the Reddit post excused him.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but \u201cthis will be a funny story to tell him when he\u2019s sober!\u201d isn\u2019t exactly how I would describe being SA\u2019d in an anonymous Reddit post if it happened to me. \n\n(OP is NTA btw)", "I\u2019m not speaking for her?

For many reasons SA victims don\u2019t say something or tell people which I listed in another reply and don\u2019t feel like typing again. If she was ok with it she would have said something like it was fine they laughed, I laughed and we all had a good time except for the guys wife. \n\nShe brushed it off to keep from starting shit. \n\nShe made it a point to not say she was cool with it all. She just brushed it off for the sake of whoever to not start shit\n\nEdit because I admit when I\u2019m wrong she did mention she shot back at him and laughed as well. \n\nI still don\u2019t think that it makes it ok and she was still a victim of unwanted touches making her a victim of someone touching her body without consent", "No one wants to be known as the girl who over reacts at things.

Why would you think otherwise?  It is super wierd to police other people's reactions to things, especially when they have just been subjected to experiences that are at best uncomfortable and perhaps traumatic.", "It was my perception of what I felt in the moment given the situation I was in and the person who did that and the state he was in.", "THIS IS NOT A PLACE FOR YOUR OPINION. Oh wait, you're right. It is. \n\nHow dare you, though!@!#$", "Or, on the other extreme, simply forgets the tell-off. Better in both cases to wait until he is sober.", "Yet so many do this :(.

That's can actually be counterproductive.", "Her comment DID show those who were sober enough to understand that she was NOT ok with what happened. \n\nAnd scowling and walking away IS enough of a confrontation to some drunk guys.

The problem is that she's saying his behaviour is ok because he was drunk, it's absolutely NOT ok.", "Was your perception that what he did was ok because he was drunk? Because that was not ok.

It hurts to admit that something like that happened to you and from someone you know especially. They wouldn\u2019t call themselves victims or survivors or whatever term but it doesn\u2019t change the fact they were. \n\nSometimes it helps to point out hey you were a victim or something that should have never happened for them to realize damn I guess that is what happened. That\u2019s why a lot end up in therapy and end up coming to terms with what happened and realizing they did go through something making them a victim or whatever. \n\nIt\u2019s not wrong to point at SA when you see it even if they don\u2019t. It would be weird to force her into saying she is, that\u2019s for OP to decide\n\nBut sitting by and saying no you\u2019re not a victim you weren\u2019t SA\u2019d can be harmful in helping to keep the party at faults actions under wraps or justified.

So he groped me, in front of a dozen other guys.\n\nShould I have just giggled and made a joke about dealing with him when he's sober? I beat the hell out of him, in front of his pals.
