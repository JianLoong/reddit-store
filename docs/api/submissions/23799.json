Somehow, I'm thinking if he had time for a commentary, this is how it played out.", "NTA. People will hate on you if you have made a scene or told him calmly or were mad at him or didn't do anything. You are a woman so there is no right answer here.", "NTA I don't understand why your friend got mad at you for her husband basically sexually assaulting and trying to humiliate you by pulling your dress up. Sounds like they are both ex friends.", "NTA - I'm sure you reacted as best you could due to the shock. I have a feeling Celia would be pissed regardless of how you reacted. She is blaming you for her husband's actions, which is unfair, but seems to happen more often than it should. I would be wary around Mike, though, as the old adage goes, sometimes alcohol brings out the truth.", "NTA but being drunk doesn't excuse predatory behavior. Mike is a lot worse than he seems, I think.", "NTA. Your friend is directing her anger at the wrong person.", "You do realize his behavior while drunk might be an indicator of what he thinks while sober? Your friend, though not right to blame you, might have acted that way because she's seen and heard how he veiws you. Run with caution around him, okay?", "NTA in anyway. Very patient and understanding too.", "Nope Celia is just mad that Mike is a cheater.

All the alcohol did was remove his behavioral inhibitions. If he was not inclined to act like that he wouldn't have. Alcohol doesn't make you do things while drunk that you object to when sober.", "INFO: was it SpongeBob underwear? Tighty-whitties? Were they at least clean?", "NTA. We've all brushed things off because people are drunk at some point or other, but it certainly wasn't your fault. Would she have liked it more if you'd made a massive scene at a friend's party? \n\nMaybe - and I'm playing devil's advocate here - she thought that you meant, let's see how he likes my underwear when he's sober. Maybe she simply misunderstood what you said because she'd also been drinking. \n\nI think you need to have a sober conversation with her.", "Alcohol, the great destroyer of relationships, chalks up another win.

NTA and the amount of victim blaming here is off the charts. Was everyone else that didn't say anything about the behaviour an asshole too ??", "Love all the victim blaming in the comments.\n\nNTA, but I would also check on Celia - her reaction made me think that she suspects her husband of cheating.", "Nta, you reacted well, by laughing it off as drunken antics you prevented causing a scene during the party. Your friend, on the otherhand made a huge scene and directed her anger in the wrong place.", "NTA. Sounds like alcoholism behavior on both parts", "That was completely his fault and she\u2019s the one who is supposed to \u201ccontrol\u201d her man, not you.", "[deleted]", "NTA if all eyes were on me i would be too stumped for a response, i would feel too humiliated to make more noise.", "YTA. It is a big deal. Drunk actions are sober thoughts.", "He's just showing who he is and she's probably upset because she knows. Doesn't matter how drunk you are, I don't know anyone who would do this kind of thing. You're N T A, but should be standing up for yourself and not allowing this kind of treatment. She should have told him it was time to leave.", "A guy yanks up my dress = instant slap. That's just me, though.", "I gotta go with ESH. Celia's anger was definitely misplaced, as the inappropriate behavior was from her spouse.\n\nThat being said?

He's just drunk, right? \n\nYour lack of response could easily have been attributed to shock/trauma, but you doubled down and openly excused it. THAT is why you are also an asshole.", "Who the fuck lifts peoples skirts up or pants down as a joke? Grow the fuck up.", "NTA.  Though, I don't think it qualifies as \"no big deal\" just because he was drunk.  His behavior was not cool, and he deserves his wife's ire (not you).", "NTA- Mike sexually assaulted you infront if his friends and your friend got mad at YOU??\n\nMike is a creep and you should stay far away from these AH\u2019s.", "NTA I\u2019d imagine your friend is either worried her husband finds you attractive or she knows he does and is insecure.", "NTA. Something happened that violated you but it also caught you off guard. You were able to rationalize that this person was your friend and they're intoxicated. If it were a stranger - I would expect a different reaction. Celia's anger and jealousy is directed at the wrong person.", "NTA. \n\nBlaming OP who is the actual victim in this scenario for her reaction is fucking stupid. She had the right to react however she wanted. \n\nMike was wrong and the AH. Celia is the other AH, and more like the redditors calling yta.", "NTA - maybe have a chat when she is sober about it and let her know you're hurt that someone who's known you for so long would act like that.", "NTA. Maybe the husband has said something to Celia about finding you attractive. She could be feeling the husband is acting on those feelings by looking up your skirt. You downplaying his awful behaviour sends message to her that you are amenable this roving hands.\n\nNone of this is your problem of course. Celia has the disease of many wives;blame everyone but the sh*t husband then you don't have to deal with his bad behaviour", "NTA\n\nYou reacted how you wanted to. Seems kinda odd that she wanted you to have a much bigger blowup.", "NTA. I don\u2019t believe you are the asshole because no matter what, you were violated in this situation. But brushing it off as \u201che\u2019s drunk\u201d is not a good excuse. \n\nWith that in mind, I think you should get counseling if that\u2019s your mindset when people assault you. And that\u2019s exactly what he did. The saying is \u201cdrunk actions are sober thoughts\u201d at least to me. I have a feeling something of this nature has happened to you before.", "NTA your boundaries got violated, and you\u2019re getting blamed for how you reacted? You decided it\u2019s not a big deal TO YOU bc you could brush it off and you know it\u2019s just bc he\u2019s drunk.

Why weren\u2019t you mad at his comments? Why arent you madder at your friend for her behaviour?", "i think ESH. i dont think you\u2019re wrong for not causing a scene. obviously it isnt your fault he did that to begin with. but i do think you should have reacted to it less jokingly tbh. \n\ni cant see myself laughing and playing that off as a joke if its my best friends husband if it was me. but thats just my take on it", "ESH, apparently Mike acts like the guys I went to Jr High with so saying that your bestie has a husband problem and it's not your problem.  You should have tried to keep him from pulling the dress up but you didn't so you are just as bad as he is.  He needs to apologize to you and his wife for his drunken behavior.\n\nEdited from NTA to ESH because she didn't care based on him being drunk and using that as an excuse is like saying boys will be boys", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The best thing you could have done under the circumstances was not make a fuss and that\u2019s what you did (or didn\u2019t) do. I think your friends anger is misplaced.

A grown man pulled up your dress at a party to comment on your underwear and laugh about it with other people. He might have been drunk, and you might socialice in different ways than I'm used to, but I personally wouldnt see those actions as no big deal.

Make sure this is a group text so both of them see exactly what is being said. Take your time with it too. Gotta wonder what else mike does when drinking. There\u2019s no excuse for what he did.

But what he did to you was not your fault in any way, shape or form.\n\nYour friend's projection of her anger at her husband's behaviour onto you was NOT acceptable.

Besides if you had I doubt very much her reaction would have been any different and likely a lot more hostile towards you for making it a big deal and for embarrassing him, and of course her. \n\nWhich is the cause of her reaction.

It sounds like there may be trouble in their relationship and this one episode took her over the edge. \n\nI would bring it up with her when you both are sober and see how she reacts.

She should be thankful you are still speaking to her and him, but instead she yelled at you.  She owes you a giant apology and he owes you one as well.", "NTA - that honor belongs to your best friend and her boyfriend. However, you might want to think twice about saying things like \"he's completely drunk so it's no big deal.\" There are plenty of people who can come up with plenty of justifications for sexually inappropriate behavior, they don't need help or reinforcement from you and the next girl they do this (or worse) to might think it's a very big deal.", "NTA.  You laughed it off to not call attention to it & make it a big deal bc you knew he was just drunk.  You have no blame here.", "NTA, but I can see why your friend is upset she might be misunderstanding you and thinking your both attracted to each other. For people saying she shouldn\u2019t be mad at you but her husband they don\u2019t know if she already talked to her husband about it or not.

I seriously commend you for staying so calm.\n\nPersonally, had anyone lifted my short dress to comment on my underwear, I would have boxed him right in the danglies, until they looked like a pair of coconuts.\n\nOn the other hand, had I been Celia, I would not have blamed my friend, but my disrespectful, unfaithful husband, who obviously has roving eyes and wandering hands. Drunk or not makes no difference to me. I would re-evaluate my relationship and would probably opt for divorce at some stage. Cheating is a definite dealbreaker for me.", "Ok this behaviour is never ok so I wouldn\u2019t laugh it off. In vino veritas: people show us who they are when alcohol lowers their inhibitions. However, your friend should be taking this out on her AH husband not you.", "NTA. I personally would have slapped the sh!t out of him, don't care if he's drunk or not, but that's just me. As for you friend, I would have told her if she has a problem with what happened and how I reacted maybe she should get a better hold of her husband. Or, would she have preferred I slapped him and made a scene? If, even in his drunken state, he's fine doing that to a friend, would that stop him from doing it when they're out and about and he does it to a stranger?", "NTA. Wow. Way to project, Celia. Celia sucks and even if he was drunk, her husband sucks too.", "NTA- you went out of your way to not make a scene and keep this from becoming some big 'event'.

If my partner were violating others, drunk or not, he would be going home and I would be questing if I was going to join, ever again.", "I don't think Celia is Jealous just angry and she wanted Op to be just as Angry.", "And even then being drunk isn\u2019t an excuse for what he did. So blaming her is even more fucking stupid because he should know better drunk or not. When me and my partner drink I set the boundary that we can\u2019t consent while drunk so no sex. And I hold myself to that no matter how much I want to when I\u2019m drunk because I know better. I hate seeing other women try to tear us down defending the inappropriate actions of men they\u2019re with", "Yea but you don't get at the victim for how she reacts, you get at the guy who lifted the skirt", "Yeah same. Maybe Celia thinks it\u2019s weird the OP wasnt more appalled by this behavior, which was pretty violating. OP seemed oddly chill about it.", "NTA, but Celia is an AH. I wouldn't check in until she apologizes. How dare she have a go at the victim Instead of her husband who's committed assault", "And given his behaviour, she is most likely right :)", "I too suspect Celia's husband of cheating. And also just being a shitty, boundary-stomping person. Being drunk doesn't change your personality, it just removes inhibitions.", "How is stepping away, and pulling your dress down while saying \u201cwoah!\u201d not considered an appropriate reaction here? \n\nSo lost in this thread", "Right?!  Honestly I'm impressed with OP's composure!  If they'd yelled at him in the moment a) they probably wouldn't have gotten a good reaction or apology from him because he was too drunk to think rationally, and then b) if they'd tried to then follow up when he was sober, I bet he/others would say \"why are you bringing it up again??  You already yelled at me/him!\"\n\nBy waiting to deal with it until he's sober, OP can collect their thoughts to deliver some searing criticism of his behavior.  They can also better determine if he's giving a genuine apology and won't do it again.  And if they do decide to cut him off, it'll be for his sober reaction/behavior, so people can't criticism them \"because he was drunk, it's just a joke!!\"", "This!", "Alcohol is not a scapegoat or to blame. Plenty of people get drunk and manage not to sexually assault their friends or be assholes.", "That's not exactly what I said but I wasn't talking in english. I was meaning \"let's see how he reacts when he gets sober and I tell him what he did\" and it was pretty clear that's what I meant.", "No, she is not supposed to control her man.  He is supposed to control himself.  Spouses, SOs, boyfriends/girlfriends are not tasked with controlling their partners, who are presumably/hopefully fully-functioning adults.", "It's her body.

The only person at fault is Celia's Husband.", "I wouldn't say that I allowed it, I was caught by surprise. If he had asked me I would have obviously never agreed or allowed it.", "I can understand that. Still I feel like her comment about me \"liking it\" was kinda inappropriate.", "Wtf did I just read? OP is as bad as Mike the dress lifter? Saying the SA / assault victim is to blame?

It's subtle, direct, not too scene causing, and just shocking enough to be memorable. \nBut don't do it in a flirty way, and don't giggle. \n\nAnd...I now wear shorts under all my skirts.", "Drunk or not, that shit isn't acceptable. I've been drunk around women friends often, I've never sexually assaulted one.", "Honestly, drunk or not, his behaviour was unacceptable and you should have told him off right away.

I'm not sure how I would react if someone I was supposed to be friends with did something to me like this, it's so wholly inappropriate.  You handled this with such grace, I'm impressed.

I can also see why you didn\u2019t want to make a scene, but what he did was inappropriate and your mild tone makes it seem like it\u2019s ok with you that he did it.

If they know this person and this isn't behavior the friend normally engage in, it's logical to not want to make a huge scene right away. Also, women endure this type of harassment from an early age and it usually never stops so it's completely reasonable that one could be desensitized to the abuse and just shrug it off as no big deal in the moment. The majority of us have experienced far worse than a drunkard lifting our skirt in public and some of us may just shrug it off.", "She's NTA for not slapping him or yelling or whatever.
