There's no one right way to react to something like this.", "You are kinda an \"a-hole\", like 50%\n\nShe is a 100% a-hole, she should be mad at him,\n\nBut you laughed and smiled, which indicates you loved it, you are 50% a-hole", "How long did this commentary on your underwear last?  If more than a split second, YTA and I can understand why his wife would feel you were onboard for this caper.  Somehow, I'm thinking if he had time for a commentary, this is how it played out.", "NTA. People will hate on you if you have made a scene or told him calmly or were mad at him or didn't do anything. You are a woman so there is no right answer here.", "NTA I don't understand why your friend got mad at you for her husband basically sexually assaulting and trying to humiliate you by pulling your dress up. Sounds like they are both ex friends.", "NTA - I'm sure you reacted as best you could due to the shock. I have a feeling Celia would be pissed regardless of how you reacted. She is blaming you for her husband's actions, which is unfair, but seems to happen more often than it should. I would be wary around Mike, though, as the old adage goes, sometimes alcohol brings out the truth.", "NTA but being drunk doesn't excuse predatory behavior. Mike is a lot worse than he seems, I think.", "NTA. Your friend is directing her anger at the wrong person.", "You do realize his behavior while drunk might be an indicator of what he thinks while sober? Your friend, though not right to blame you, might have acted that way because she's seen and heard how he veiws you. Run with caution around him, okay?", "NTA in anyway. Very patient and understanding too.", "Nope Celia is just mad that Mike is a cheater. NTA\n\nOh and steer clear of Mike, he is absolutely a creep freak and that behavior was just the surface.", "YTA/ESH. He is of course a total asshole too. But you completely under-reacted to you best friends husband sexually assaulting you. You laughed?! I cannot comprehend how you're not more upset over this, it's definitely not \"no big deal\". Being drunk is not an excuse to be a pervert.", "Mike might not act like that when sober, but he's been wanting to. All the alcohol did was remove his behavioral inhibitions. If he was not inclined to act like that he wouldn't have. Alcohol doesn't make you do things while drunk that you object to when sober.", "INFO: was it SpongeBob underwear? Tighty-whitties? Were they at least clean?", "NTA. We've all brushed things off because people are drunk at some point or other, but it certainly wasn't your fault. Would she have liked it more if you'd made a massive scene at a friend's party? \n\nMaybe - and I'm playing devil's advocate here - she thought that you meant, let's see how he likes my underwear when he's sober. Maybe she simply misunderstood what you said because she'd also been drinking. \n\nI think you need to have a sober conversation with her.", "Alcohol, the great destroyer of relationships, chalks up another win. Maybe two. \n\nVery mature and controlled response by you. You my friend are NTA. Not surprising since you were the sober one.

Why weren't you more angry with him?", "She\u2019s upset about what happened and I think I\u2019d be too, but she\u2019s displacing her anger on you instead of the person she should be angry with, aka her husband. This is just another case of \u201cblaming the victim\u201d (not that you\u2019re a victim in this case) instead of the person who did the deed kind of like when a woman is blamed for a man\u2019s misdeeds. You\u2019re kind to have understood that he was drunk and not be offended by it. NTA", "Info: would you have had the same reaction if he did that to another woman in front of you?", "NTA. You were blindsided and didnt really know how to react which is completely normal. You could have flipped your shit and still wouldnt be TA.", "Wow. NTA and the amount of victim blaming here is off the charts. Was everyone else that didn't say anything about the behaviour an asshole too ??", "Love all the victim blaming in the comments.\n\nNTA, but I would also check on Celia - her reaction made me think that she suspects her husband of cheating.", "Nta, you reacted well, by laughing it off as drunken antics you prevented causing a scene during the party. Your friend, on the otherhand made a huge scene and directed her anger in the wrong place.", "NTA. Sounds like alcoholism behavior on both parts", "That was completely his fault and she\u2019s the one who is supposed to \u201ccontrol\u201d her man, not you.", "ESH\n\nBeing no drunk is no excuse for what he did to you. You absolutely should have reacted. What he did is not okay. So he's the asshole for that.\n\nYou're the asshole because you should not allow anybody to disrespect you like that or assault you like that drunk or not, and laughing it off could be dangerous or seen as accepting it. You do get a bit of a pass because you don't know how a guy is going to react to being brought to task for their poor behavior. /r/whenwomenrefuse is a sub for a reason\n\nYour friend is an asshole because it was her husband who assaulted you. She's victim blaming and she's a fucking asshole for that.", "NTA if all eyes were on me i would be too stumped for a response, i would feel too humiliated to make more noise.", "YTA. It is a big deal. Drunk actions are sober thoughts.", "He's just showing who he is and she's probably upset because she knows. Doesn't matter how drunk you are, I don't know anyone who would do this kind of thing. You're N T A, but should be standing up for yourself and not allowing this kind of treatment. She should have told him it was time to leave.", "A guy yanks up my dress = instant slap. That's just me, though.", "I gotta go with ESH. Celia's anger was definitely misplaced, as the inappropriate behavior was from her spouse.\n\nThat being said? Your excusing the action and then doubling down because \"he's drunk\" was reprehensible. If he'd assaulted you further, would you still excuse it? Why ? He's just drunk, right? \n\nYour lack of response could easily have been attributed to shock/trauma, but you doubled down and openly excused it. THAT is why you are also an asshole.", "Who the fuck lifts peoples skirts up or pants down as a joke? Grow the fuck up.", "NTA.  Though, I don't think it qualifies as \"no big deal\" just because he was drunk.  His behavior was not cool, and he deserves his wife's ire (not you).", "NTA- Mike sexually assaulted you infront if his friends and your friend got mad at YOU??\n\nMike is a creep and you should stay far away from these AH\u2019s.", "NTA I\u2019d imagine your friend is either worried her husband finds you attractive or she knows he does and is insecure.", "NTA. Something happened that violated you but it also caught you off guard. You were able to rationalize that this person was your friend and they're intoxicated. If it were a stranger - I would expect a different reaction. Celia's anger and jealousy is directed at the wrong person.", "NTA. \n\nBlaming OP who is the actual victim in this scenario for her reaction is fucking stupid. She had the right to react however she wanted. \n\nMike was wrong and the AH. Celia is the other AH, and more like the redditors calling yta.", "NTA - maybe have a chat when she is sober about it and let her know you're hurt that someone who's known you for so long would act like that.", "NTA. Maybe the husband has said something to Celia about finding you attractive. She could be feeling the husband is acting on those feelings by looking up your skirt. You downplaying his awful behaviour sends message to her that you are amenable this roving hands.\n\nNone of this is your problem of course. Celia has the disease of many wives;blame everyone but the sh*t husband then you don't have to deal with his bad behaviour", "NTA\n\nYou reacted how you wanted to. Seems kinda odd that she wanted you to have a much bigger blowup.", "NTA. I don\u2019t believe you are the asshole because no matter what, you were violated in this situation. But brushing it off as \u201che\u2019s drunk\u201d is not a good excuse. \n\nWith that in mind, I think you should get counseling if that\u2019s your mindset when people assault you. And that\u2019s exactly what he did. The saying is \u201cdrunk actions are sober thoughts\u201d at least to me. I have a feeling something of this nature has happened to you before.", "NTA your boundaries got violated, and you\u2019re getting blamed for how you reacted? You decided it\u2019s not a big deal TO YOU bc you could brush it off and you know it\u2019s just bc he\u2019s drunk. If anyone has a problem, it should be with him for doing it in the first place and not your reaction", "I have been very very drunk in my life.  I have never behaved that way.", "Nta. Why weren\u2019t you mad at his comments? Why arent you madder at your friend for her behaviour?", "i think ESH. i dont think you\u2019re wrong for not causing a scene. obviously it isnt your fault he did that to begin with. but i do think you should have reacted to it less jokingly tbh. \n\ni cant see myself laughing and playing that off as a joke if its my best friends husband if it was me. but thats just my take on it", "NTA apparently Mike acts like the guys I went to Jr High with so saying that your bestie has a husband problem and it's not your problem.  You should have tried to keep him from pulling the dress up but you didn't so you are just as bad as he is.  He needs to apologize to you and his wife for his drunken behavior.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She gets to react however the hell she wants.", "Have you ever been in an uncomfortable situation like that as a woman? \n\nLaughing it off and removing yourself from the situation is often the easiest and safest way to deal with something like this. Then speak to the people involved when sober. \n\nMost people don't want to escalate a situation among friends at someone else's party. You get sooo much backlash. \n\nNervous laughter is also a thing. Many of us use the same deflection. \n\nStop victim blaming.", "She doesn't have to be more angry with him.

Victim blaming would be if her lack of reaction was due to shock/trauma, etc. \n\nShe flat out excused his behavior because \"he was drunk\".

That's called gaslighting. It is not \"funny\", it's weird, odd, and sexual. It is a form of flirting. Laughing is a sign of you \"liking it\".
