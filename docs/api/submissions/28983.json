I am doing it basically all now as my fianc\u00e9 is not comfortable with being 100% financially responsible for our family (though he\u2019s making enough to do that - it\u2019s a mindset scarcity thing). \n\nWe have discussed more traditional roles before as it would really make me happy - it\u2019s not attainable for me to work AND raise kiddo AND do chores, especially when his afternoon nap will drop. It\u2019s a lot and I am looking forward to revise our roles and responsibilities in the family. \n\nYesterday he brought up that I could not stop working if I still wanted to do things for myself that cost money (theater, out with girlfriends or my sister, Disney trips with mom, basically anything that I\u2019d like to do for me to recharge that does not include him). He basically said that providing for the family and providing for me are two separate things. \n\nHe also said that, although he wouldn\u2019t want to lift a finger around the house or our kids caretaking unless he feels like it, I should not expect to have right to half of his income but will receive an allowance for my labor at max if I insisted on quitting working to be a SAHM. \n\n His logic, and I quote: I could hire an au-pair to bring the same value to the household for 2-3K max so I don\u2019t think you should have access to more than that if I pay the rest of the bills already. \n\nTake into account that he\u2019s making 20-30K a month and he is a BIG spender. He is very materialistic and loves nice, expensive stuff. I don\u2019t value that, although I do like to travel and go places which of course costs money too. \n\nIn the end, it is not that I NEED more than 2K to spend on just myself because heck, that\u2019s a whole lot of money for fun stuff. It\u2019s the fact that the value I have to bring to handle the house and kid is degraded to \u201can au-pair could do the same and that\u2019s the value you have in this family\u201d. It\u2019s getting more and more into a respect thing for me. \n\nSo very long story short: AITA for wanting half of the value my soon-to-be-husband provides as he also expects me to take responsibility of the kid and the house and profit from that? Isn\u2019t that what traditional roles look like, even with higher pay?\n\nEdit: to clarify: I do not expect to get a paycheck that consists of half of his money. What I expect is 1 account which pays bills, and that we both have full access to to do things we want in a responsible way.

Expecting half - at this point, after you\u2019ve had a kid and you\u2019re not yet married - seems like something you should have ironed out *before* your relationship got so serious that you now share a child. I think that\u2019s where you went wrong. How did you not see this laziness and selfishness beforehand? Did you two discuss how you would raise a family and what roles each of you would take? Did something change along the way or is this behavior an attitude something you willingly ignored up until now? \n\nAnd it seems like he is a **massive** asshole for not contributing to the household duties/child duties. He\u2019s also a massive AH for the attitude he has and the way he regards you and your contribution to the relationship/household. Sounds like you\u2019re a free housekeeper/au pair.", "I\u2019ll never understand why people think it\u2019s a good idea to move in with people and have children with them when they don\u2019t even verify that they agree on the basic aspects of relationships and life. Or that they actually like each other. And then they\u2019ll say that they arent ready to get married or be engaged as if they aren\u2019t already irrevocably bound by the child they made. I think I put in more effort into picking a bed spread than some of these OPs do in choosing co-parents and financial \u201cpartners\u201d and spouses", "I\u2019m a SAHM; it\u2019s great. \n\nBut, I\u2019m confused about what you\u2019re asking. What do you mean when you say you want half of the value of what he brings in? You expect him to cut you a check? Like, that\u2019s not how that works. \n\nFirst, my husband is the financial guy. He earns the money and pays the bills (it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t know how, calm down someone who\u2019s about to yell at me). I can see the bank account if I want, but I generally have no interest.  If there\u2019s something I want and over our agreed upon threshold (it\u2019s 300) then I ask him if it\u2019s financially possible right now. Otherwise, we\u2019re still partners. It\u2019s not that he gives me half of his money, but I do have access to what I need or want. \n\nSecond, your contribution in this partnership is your home duties and the caring of your son. That your fianc\u00e9 thinks less of that is quite troubling. I mean, a good au pair who cooks and cleans is going to be a lot more than 3k a month. And even then, who wants strangers raising their kid if they don\u2019t have to have them?\n\nI think you\u2019re both the AH. Him for being a financial tyrant who won\u2019t help with his own kid unless he feels like it, and you for thinking you should get a check for being a SAHM.", "Au pairs only work from 8am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.  Their role is childminding, and light housework - making children's meals and cleaning up after children.  You would still need to hire someone for the laundry, cleaning, mopping, vacuuming, shopping, cooking etc.  See if he agrees to this.", "INFO: sorry, I just want to be clear - your understanding of the \u201ctraditional role\u201d of the wife is that you don\u2019t work but you receive half of his wage income?\n\nWhere are you getting this? What tradition is that supposed to be?", "ESH You don't want to be paid like an an-pair for being a SAHM, you want him to provide more because he is a high earner. He doesn't want to do anything for the kid, so basically wants to pay someone to look after the kid for him.\n\nThe only person that matters in all this is the kid. It seems to boil down to money not what is best for them.", "I really hope he doesn\u2019t marry you. You both are just not compatible, and yes, if he has the money, your contribution would be easily replace. \n\nYou would be an AH to yourself and to him if you marry him expecting access to his money, because you cannot just decide to not work knowing he is not agree with that. YTA.", "ESH.\n\nHe thinks providing for you (essentially, any money you want to spend that doesn't involve him directly) isn't the same as providing for your family. How far does that insanity extend, exactly? Does he believe he's not responsible for things like your underwear (if he doesn't like that particular pair) or your clothing (again, if he thinks it's \"for you\" and not for him)? What about retirement funds? Is he only saving for his own retirement (without you)?\n\nAlso, is he aware that when you are married he won't have the luxury of deciding how much your labor happens to be \"worth\"? I mean, divorce law doesn't work like that. Furthermore, while he might be a big spender, it's not smart to keep being a big spender. His business is doing well now, so now is the time to save and setup financial security for the future. Does he get that?\n\nYou, on the other hand, seem to think that the issue is access to the money to spend however you like... which, if you don't spend extravagently, maybe that's fine. But everybody - even people who rake in big bucks - need a budget. Instead of framing this conversation as you having an equal hand in the family budget, you're framing this as access to funds specifically, which doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm assuming you do most of the necessary shopping (clothing, groceries, etc.), right? At the very least, you need access to family funds for that kind of thing. You also need access to your own funds for \"fun\" money or whatever. But you will also need to be following some semblance of sanity (aka a budget) as would he. This isn't just about access to funds---this is about financial security and stability.\n\nSo, ESH. Neither one of you seems to get how important sharing the burden of the budget is.

Don't stop working because this marriage will either not take place or won't last. You should not become totally dependent on someone who really doesn't seem to care about you.

Judging by the comments here, it would appear that he isn\u2019t really keen on the idea of being a father if he doesn\u2019t want anything at all to do with caring for the kids.", "YTA.\n\nTo expect 50%, yes, you are an AH.\n\nLet hubby-to-be hire a housekeeper/cook and a nanny so you can work to support yourself and share all expenses 50/50.\n\nIf I were hubby,  I wouldn't marry you without an ironclad prenup.", "YTA\n\nIf you wanted to be a SAHM this should have been a conversation you had BEFORE you got married and definitely before you had a kid.\n\nI would have said N.A.H. because people are allowed to change their minds.

By being a SAHM you further his business and abandon your own career for the family.  In doing that you have no retirement and no assets.  He could leave you with only your allowance and you'll have Ben out of the job place for years.  It will be impossible to catch up.\n\nYou should have never supported his career by putting yours on the back burner without being married.  The balance is very off now.

Half his income is about 10k a month. He *can* hire a nanny, a very high end one even, for less than half of that. He could hire a nanny, a maid, a cook, and likely 2 random staff for what you're expecting. SAHM is wonderful that you're fulfilled by that, honestly it is.

Given that level of income, I'd imagine it easier to just have you put whatever on a credit card and pay it off every month. If you go nuts spending, there's an easy record to pin it down, but also an easy way to just manage it as a regular expense.\n\nAll in all? I doubt you two are a good fit.

But I think the best solution is to hire a cleaner/housekeeper to do cleaning, washing, ironing 2-3 times per week using his wage. Then you do most SAHM stuff and take a part-time job for fun money.

But if you do, I feel bad for the child. The parents are selfish.", "So here is why YTA:\nYou want to be a SAHM. BUT your spouse to be does not want you to be a SAHM. \n\nDo you have shared finances? Is the plan to merge finances if you marry or to maintain separate finances? It sounds like your spouse wants to maintain separate finances. \n\nIt also sounds like you don\u2019t wanna work and you\u2019d enjoy SAH, but he doesn\u2019t not think that the value of you being a SAHM is worth the pay cut you would be taking when you stop working. That can be boiled down to a financial calculation based on the cost of childcare that you\u2019d be replacing by staying at home. \n\nHe is not an AH just because he doesn\u2019t want you to SAH or because he wants to maintain separate finances after marriage. \n\nIf you both work equal amounts of time and he STILL refuses to do chores and participate in childcare, that WOULD make him an AH. But in this case it sounds like he\u2019s just saying that he does not support your SAH plan.", "Of its going to cost him half his income (at 20-30k a month) it doesn't seem like it would be in his best interest. If you paid half the house bills and half of childcare expenses, as would be fair, he would be much further ahead financially. It sounds like you just decided you don't want to work, and managed to \"oops\" your way into getting a wealthy man to pay your bills.", "Pretty rare occurrence in anyone\u2019s book at the best of times", "I don't know anyone who earns that much and gives their spouse 50/50 access.", "Bruh she wants 10-15k per month. Fuck no that's not what its worth. Professional level housestaff GROUP doesn't cost that.  YTA", "Nobody said it isn't work. But it's not what he agreed to. She's trying to change the rules because ... well ... that's what she wants.", "So you don\u2019t really want half of his income you want it all?", "You just don\u2019t deserve it. Get a job.", "OMG dude got baby trapped.", "You are extremely welcome. I consider it my super power irl to be able to make people laugh even when they don't feel okay.", "If he's running his own business, making 20-30k per month, and it made them fall into \"traditional\" roles, he isn't working 40 hours a week. It sounds like he had to work all the time and she ended up caring for the kid more. This is definitely something they should have talked about and planned before this point, but I think assuming he isn't pulling his weight is unfair.", "Didn\u2019t you read the post ? She doesn\u2019t want to earn an income. That makes the entire child raising part solely her job. And this applies regardless of the genders.", "[deleted]", "1.) There was more housework 60 years ago.\n2.) How many kids?\n3.) Did she just say: I do X, you do Y?\n\nNobody judges you for wanting to be a sahm, it's how you go about it.", "Back then you could live on 1 income.", "[deleted]", "I hope so. If it is that then that\u2019s horrible, and not the basis of a relationship (respect and love).", "Some days he works 12, some days he works 3. Average would be 6-8 hours a day on weekdays", "Their finances, up until now, have always been separate. \n\nIt's easy to understand how he can't immediately make the mental switch from it being their money rather than his money. \n\nHe doesn't want a SAHM and would rather hire a nanny/au pair and have a double income household but she doesn't agree, there are no real ah here", "This is, indeed, a very big red flag.", "My understanding in that arrangement is everything is paid from the single account.", "My wife and I do it this way:  \n\n\nAll our incomes go into one account.  All the household bills etc come out of that account.  Separately, my wife has an account where we put an allowance each month.  That is money she can do whatever she wants with and have zero accountability on.  If she wants to give it away, burn it, spend it on whatever, that's not my concern.  I dont buy much for myself anymore but if it came to that, we'd set up an allowance for me too.", "I think we need to look at op\u2019s earnings potential. If she is getting 2-3k a month just working when kid is napping and between cleaning and everything what can she earn on a 30 hour week? If that suddenly goes to 7-10k then why should she walk away from that kind of money?", "I am not quite that high and my husband is SAHP and we have full access. One credit card account that I pay off in full and he can spend whatever he wants. As I do. Normal people in committed relationships know that when you split, the money is split 50:50. So why try to hoard it during the marriage and create one resentful unhappy partner? You\u2019re just speeding up the process of losing 50% of your wealth.", "Bill Gates is the first example I can think of. \n\nI'm a SAHM and my husband doesn't make this much but he makes 6 figures and we're comfortable and half is all mine.", "Because earning that much money as a man usually requires them to be smart minus any hedge fund kids. Smart people don't give up complete access to their money in any circumstances.", "I'm sure they charge extra for fucking.", "She wants a partnership. She is working AND doing everything at home right now....that's BS. If he doesn't want to lift a finger at least he can provide for everyone in the house or what good is he to the relationship. She would be better off collecting child support.", "Ofcourse they should talk about it before having kids, id never say they shouldnt have. But as i read in comments, it was an accident and they just kept it? Im just responding to the \"all those single mothers do it too\" thing... aint no fun place to be in as single kom, especially WHEN SHE HAS A HUSBAND?? if he works more so she has to work less, that means they should share the money and both have access to the funds. She should be able to do fun stuff for herself OR he works less and dads more.. he cant have it stay all the same while having children. He is a dad now, and he should act like it.....", "Im responding to the comment with the whole \nyou can just work AND do the household AND take care of the kid, plenty of single moms do it....\n\nDidnt you read what i commented to?\n\nBesides. No. Being a dad is more than just contributing money. Poor, poor child having the mother be the only parent, as its \"solely her job\" as you say. Being a dad and having a present dad is important. But if he so chooses to work insane hours on his own company mostly leaving no space for the wife to work AND do the household AND do the childcare, then he should be oke with her becoming a SAHM and having access to the household funds & funds for her own fun stuff.........", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019re on the same page. OP said her husband would be paying all the household expenses and paying her 2-3k a month. That\u2019s 24-36k a year. She has already said that her yearly fun expenses add up to about $5k so the money that he would be paying her is more than she needs. She will not be covering any of the household bills.\n\nWhat she\u2019s asking for is shared income, which she is not wrong to ask for. My wife is a stay at home mom and we share our expenses and my income but that was a joint decision. Not all couples choose to mix finances. But that is something you typically should figure out before marriage and kids.", "And yet single mothers do it all the time \ud83e\udd14", "Good point", "No he is for he doesn\u2019t think he should have to help clean or childcare if he doesn\u2019t want to if she a sahm. He still has responsibilities for his child.", "Sorry I am reading this differently if he wanted to hire an au pair/nanny I would be fine with that but I\u2019m reading it as he wants wife to do that work and if she quits her job to do it he will give her 2-3k a month but even if she works she still has to do the other things. If I am wrong and he is happy to pay for an au pair or whatever while op can still earn her own money then I will change my vote but right now he is being a dick.", "And OP just gets allowance/fun money? That seems more than fair to me really. If that is the arrangement and she's not okay with it it sounds like she's a little bit greedy...", "Yeah, but that's not what OP seems to want. From what I gather she wants half of his money for herself?", "That's what we're all asking her!! \n\nWhy would she give up her job? \n\nNot even her husband wants her to", "As in he gives you 50% and you invest as you see fit? Or you get your part and he (or you) invests the rest?", "Smart or very good at taking advantage of people.  The more I learn about the jobs that pay so much, the more I learn they're generally exploitative.  Being smart doesn't translate into making lots of money.", "In my family it was my dad who studied and worked in finance, my mother had access to the money, but he invested it (obviously he talked to her), but it was the same with all his co-workers. If the wives needed the money they had access to it, but they would spend what they needed to or wanted and the rest went to their investments,/retirements or holiday. None had their own investment accounts. Maybe that's all changed.", "She wants him to bankroll her life.", "BS. She wants half of 20-30k and then wants to be half of that for herself. She is a digger and he is mine. Being a SAHM does not entitle you to half the paycheck for funsies.", "He IS offering to provide for everyone in the house.", "But is she entitled to 10 grand a month though?", "The way I understood it the options are:\n\n- hire a nanny/Au pair and keep the wife working\n\n- let the wife be a SAHM and give her an allowance of 3k per month \n\n- keep things as they are now", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even that she gets an allowance, she just have full access to spend according to however they budget. That\u2019s how my husband and I do it. It\u2019s just all one pot of money period", "Ok who will look after the house and kid because right now it looks like she is struggling.", "Everything is shared accounts, big decisions are made together.  Smaller ones we can each do as we see fit.  When there is only one income it makes no sense to try to have separate finances.", ">Smart or very good at taking advantage of people.\n\nTypically, you have to be smart to do this, so you're basically repeating yourself imo.\n\n>Being smart doesn't translate into making lots of money.\n\nYea, not all smart people become rich, but almost all rich people who have generated their own wealth during their lifetime is generally considered to be above average in regards to intellect.", "Things definitely have changed. Divorce rates are reasonably stable at around 50% for first-time marriages and closer to 70% for second marriages and beyond. On top of fewer people even getting married to begin with. I'll include a source for those numbers below. If you Google it, you can find even better sources.\n\n[According to the American Psychological Association, approximately 40-50% of first marriages end in divorce. The divorce rate for second marriages is even higher, with approximately 60-67% of second marriages ending in divorce.](https://www.petrellilaw.com/divorce-statistics-for-2022/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20American%20Psychological,second%20marriages%20ending%20in%20divorce.)", "As a SAHM for 1 kid lmao.", "No but look at her edit maybe? She just misworded it, she wants to share funds, and not just for groceries and school supplies for the kid..  if she is a SAHM and he the only one working, ngl, thats how it should be. They have kids together dude....", "See I can kind of agree with that but looking at all the posts and replies I don\u2019t think the bf wants to hire a nanny/au pair which to me is the best and fairest option.", "But she states that either she gets an allowance or she gets half of his money? Or did I misunderstand OP's story?"]}
