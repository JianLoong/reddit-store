I get the point made by those saying YTA but your dad being sad you are leaving doesn't mean he gets a pass if his coping mechanism is causing you grief as well.", "NTA \n\nYou guys need to have an actually conversation.\n\nI know you think you\u2019ve made yourself clear, but your dads is just listening to what you say,\nhe ain\u2019t hearing you. \n\nSit him down, tell him exactly how your feeling.", "NTA Although I completely understand that he is a father and is sad about his kid moving out, you deserve the independence you want.", "NAH\n\nThis is a universal joke. Think of it this way -- every time he says it, he is really saying that he loves you and will miss you when you go.", "It\u2019s hard to tell from the info given whether he\u2019s a controlling person who doesn\u2019t want you to get out on your own or just super attached and maybe has some attachment issues and is gonna miss you. \n\nSnapping probably isn\u2019t the best way to deal with this situation. Try to have an honest conversation. It might hurt, but it\u2019s better then letting everything pile up until you snap at him. \n\nI\u2019m gonna go with NAH. You\u2019re not in the wrong for being frustrated, and from the information given it doesn\u2019t seem as though he\u2019s being an ahole either", "NTA. You need to establish boundaries with your father. If there's another adult in your lives - an uncle, grandparent, family friend - have them help you explain to your dad that you don't find this funny and that you will be going to college BY YOURSELF. \n\nAside: My friend's daughter actively wants her parents to move to where she goes to college. Good for you for asserting your independence!", "NAH. I get it, originally I wanted my freedom in undergrad too. Even now that I\u2019m older, my dad or mom joke about moving nearby or having me move near them. It\u2019s kinda an exaggerative thing most of the time (like complaining that you\u2019re starving), but it\u2019s how they tell me they miss me. \n\nAfter I went away for undergrad, sometimes my mom couldn\u2019t find my dad at home. When she would look for him, she\u2019d find him standing in the entrance of my room, just looking at it. She told me that one of these times, he turned to her and asked softly if she thought I missed them the way he missed me.\n\nMy family experience is not your family experience, but it sounds like he sees you as all he\u2019s got, family wise. I can totally understand why you\u2019re frustrated by it, but this is a huge stressful/transitional period for both of you. You\u2019re both trying to figure out what life will look like in the near future, and it\u2019s going to look very different from how it\u2019s been. Joking about the change may be him trying to cope with it, or express how much he\u2019s going to miss you. Try and be gentle with yourself and with him, neither of you are wrong for your feelings", "NAH. Have a serious talk with him. This is no \"joke\" - be appreciative for all he's done for you, but firm that you want to be on your own and learn to be independent.\n\nEDIT: Remind him that they also have these things called \"phones\" and you can stay in touch.", "NAH. Ahh OP- this is a sweet joke. I get you\u2019re annoyed and he\u2019s not serious, he just loves and is going to miss you. I have a kid about your age and would totally make this joke, it\u2019s hard for parents to let their kids go and it\u2019s so sweet coming from Dad.", "NTA. In my own life, I lost my Mom when I was 25 and lost my Dad when I was 27. I miss them so much every single day. Not trying to lay guilt on you, just be kind, if possible", "NAH , he just loves you and is gonna miss you", "NTA because you said it perfectly that he\u2019s sad you\u2019re moving out and is using this opportunity to keep himself from hurting because he knows you aren\u2019t always gonna be around anymore. Humor him because you won\u2019t have that when you\u2019re on your own \ud83d\ude0a", " A soft YTA for snapping at him. \n\nI think he means well and is just going to miss you and is trying to make light of a situation that\u2019s hard for him.", "NTA\n\nMake sure the school you choose requires students to live in the dorms for the first couple of years.  That way, even if he moves to the area, you'll have some space.", "NTA but I wanna let you know that you will miss him, the free laundry, free food, companionship outside of school & just someone to talk to who loves you flaws aside. First year of college  can be scary and lonely", "NTA: You are an adult, you decide your next move. He needs to respect that and give you space.", "NAH, but unless you think he's really going to stalk you across the continent-- he's getting in all the dad jokes there are while there's time.  Unless he's serious, he just sounds like a dork.", "NTA. Once is a joke. Once. Repeatedly is weird and creepy.", "NTA - That's not a funny joke. If he's sad tell him to get a puppy. Or better yet, a therapist.", "NTA, you\u2019re already stressed with what\u2019s going on, you\u2019ve asked him to stop and he\u2019s ignored you. It\u2019s rude. You\u2019re doing fine. Best of luck!", "My abusive mother followed me across country twice.  Not saying your father is abusive, I obviously don't know him.  Just mentioning it happens.\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou are looking forward to a parent-child relationship as adults while your father might want you to meet all his emotional needs instead of him having pro-social connections to other family, friends, or a romantic partner. From [your comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12c27fj/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_my_dad_wont_shut_up/jezp1af)\n that you & your father do not have other family or your mom in your life, your father might be seeking \"emotional intimacy\" with you which can be uncomfortable. That is sometimes called/related to \"emotional incest.\" Learn more about that and discuss with your father and a therapist if needed. \n\nYour high school or college might have a therapist available. Your family health insurance plan might have therapists available for you and/or your father. Your father's employer might an \"Employee Support Program\" or \"Employee Assistance Program\" or similar.", "Yup he sucks.

Let him know if you hope to do those things during summers. This may help dissuade him from moving to your college town, since you might be away from there a lot anyway.\n\nAnd what about after college? It's early for you to know... But it's he going to move near your first job? Are you hoping to return to your hometown for work?\n\nLast, I would also give this anecdote. I needed my parents most as an adult once I had kids of my own. Many of my friends and co-workers who are now in their mid to late 30's are having their newly-retired parents moving to be closer to them. Some of this is in reaction to the pandemic lock downs, but I think it's nice. If that's something you hope for in your long term future, be open about that with him."]}
