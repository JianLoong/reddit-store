Additionally, I think its relevant that our program has about a 50/50 split between men and women while the POC percentage is closer to 20%.\n\nThe issue primarily came up because A constantly talks about things like male privilege in STEM and the world in general. I tend to agree with her most of the time, clearly there are very big and systemic issues in both the world in general and academia in regards to sexism. However, A has recently ramped up a lot of her comments, constantly talking about my \"privilege\" as a male. Examples would include things like talking about how easy it is for me to be taken seriously and how a lot of my confidence in an academic environment is due to my gender. Looking at these statements, I definitely agree. In a school environment I absolutely am in a place of privilege, but something she seems to neglect to see is that school is one of the few places where I am seen purely for my ability and rather than my race.\n\nI brought this up recently when she was talking about how easy everything must be for me and my other male classmates (who are all also white), and I got a bit annoyed because she was grouping me with people who definitely have much more privilege than me. I told her that yes in the school environment I am in a place of privilege, but in almost every other aspect of life she has much more privilege than I do, and the treatment she receives in daily life is much more in line with the other white male classmates than me. Even in the program, it can be quite isolating since I can walk into a room where I am one of the only people of color, while she has many people who look like her. If she was also a person of color I'd have no issues with the things she was saying, but me being male does not cancel out being a person of color, just as her being a woman does not cancel out her whiteness. She got annoyed at these comments and said I was being sexist and refusing to acknowledge my privilege.\n\nAgain I am not disagreeing with most of the things she has said, but AITA for pointing out that in almost all other areas of life she has much more privilege than I do?

WOC here. Sexism is *extremely* bad. We just lost abortion rights. There's such a heavy push to shove women back into the dark age right now. Men in general really don't seem to be understanding how scary that is. \n\nYou're right that being male doesn't cancel out being poc but in that environment being male gives you more privilege than her being white. People might be covertly racist but I'm willing to bet they're overtly sexist. \n\nHer privilege as a white woman and yours as a well educated poc man are kind of similar actually. You're both facing different kinds of discrimination regularly. I understand wanting a white person to acknowledge their privilege before acknowledging your own but that's usually a losing battle.", "As a woman and a woman of color I can tell you I've had ten times the struggle in my career and life due to the fact I am a woman rather than that I am of color. Additionally, I'm in the STEM field as well and it's absolute dogshit the way women are treated, passed up for opportunities, esp in biotech I've literally had the VP of chemistry at my first job talk about how I \"have a good body for kids and should try to find a husband to get pregnant.\" So I empathize very strongly with any woman experiencing this type of struggle.\n\nI understand it may be frustrating to hear this constantly brought up, but when you are in the thick of it, sometimes all you feel is rage. She should acknowledge that things are difficult for you as well. But it really is just so fucking difficult to navigate this field as a woman. NAH. You are within your right to feel offended but her statements all ring very true to me, and I understand the feeling of realizing this once you enter the field and not being able to get over it.", "I hope she doesn't drive. She's got a huge blind spot for intersections.", "I agree with you being a person of color that white women have a lot more privilege generally. I would never deny that I, as a white woman, can feel safer with police encounters and rarely do I find anyone suspicious of my actions or intent, among many other things (just the first that came to mind). \n\nThe hard part is that as women, it\u2019s easy to get down about patriarchal issues when it comes down to things like walking alone at night or people not believing rape survivors, etc., so I can absolutely believe her feeling that way generally. As much as the most privileged women in society are white, the patriarchy is so very invasive and prevalent that we still fear for our safety (i.e. most women get killed by a partner, the leading cause of death for pregnant women is murder, etc). These kind of statistics are absolutely true of racial discrimination, too, of course, and we MUST address that women of color are doubly affected by these things as you mentioned. \n\nThat being said, I think it\u2019s wholly inappropriate for her to talk about you having MORE privilege than her - I would feel so uncomfortable saying anything like that to my friends of color. The simple fact is, we face different kinds of discrimination from the same source - white, patriarchal society. The fact that she feels okay to say that to you makes me think she doesn\u2019t have a very good grasp of social issues and how these are deeply intertwined, making it, at it\u2019s root, the same issue, not a discrimination competition.", "In this, it doesn't matter if you're an asshole or not. It's not about being right. It's about growing. Both of you should try to be more empathetic to one another. Uplift rather than comparing who has it worse because you both have to deal with unfair stuff. Your experiences are valid, but hers are, too. Female students typically can't network with male professors the way male students do, because it can often be seen as a sign of romantic interest. On the other hand, you are seen as a threat in public places because of your skin color, where her white skin isn't seen as threatening. It's all shit.", "NTA - I'm a WOC and she sounds like she's suffering from white feminist syndrome. Hard. Advise her to read Audre Lorde or literally any book in the last 10 years on intersectionality.", "Society at large hasn't caught on yet to intersectionality. In some respects you both have privilege and in others, you're both from equity seeking groups. \n\nIt shouldn't be a competition as to who is more disadvantaged than the other. \n\nYou don't know what it's like to live as a woman so you are in no position to assume that \"in almost all other areas of life she has much more privilege than I...\" In some ways that's probably true and in others you are probably completely wrong. \n\nShe doesn't know what it's like to live as a POC and it's obnoxious of her to assume that the treatment you receive in STEM is much more in line with other white male classmates. \n\nA mild ESH.", "NAH.

Racism and misogyny/patriarchy are both realities. \n\nIt would be like someone who was beaten as a child arguing with someone who was raped about who was more traumatized. It\u2019s just not a helpful discussion. \n\nYou could have engaged as allies, supporting each other in the face of discrimination.", "NTA. I find people like A utterly insufferable. Obviously racism and sexism are both very real issues, but there are some people who have to turn everything into an oppression Olympics. A is certainly allowed to talk about issues of sexism, but telling you to \u201ccheck your male privilege\u201d does nothing to actually foster intelligent discussion about the topic.

We all have hardships. Best to be respectful of that and try not to shame others for what we see as privilege. (And please understand I am saying this as a WOC who OFTEN FORGET THIS. And would benefit firm listening to my own advice.)", "NTA, I find people have an easier time understanding privilege when it's a more isolated example. \n\nEx. A black guy vs a black woman to explain male privilege or a white woman vs a black woman for white privilege. \n\nI honestly think she is the one having trouble acknowledging her white privilege than you have accepting male privilege.\n\nThe whole point of intersectional oppression is to support each other, and that even if person A has privilege over you in one aspect, like race or gender, you could have privilege over them in other areas, like sexuality or disability. It's not about calculating individual oppressions/privileges to find out \"who has it worse\" especially because that can be pretty fluid depending on the environment. \n\nAnyway, you're doing fine she is being immature and a shitty ally. Hopefully she realizes it and grows, but if not never blame yourself. Her shitty attitude is not your fault or responsibility.\n\nAnd it's not sexist to tell a woman she has white privilege, that is some of the most ridiculous bull I've heard.", "NTA she should be like you and accept the common ground and differences alike.", "Nta.

Her issue about your privilege at work is legit. So is your issue about her privilege navigating the other 80% of the world. Ask her if she's prepared to swap places with you in a traffic stop. Or when you're trailed at a shopping mall.  Show her links to the men of color who get the police called on them for being real estate agents while black. Or for watering their neighbors lawn.", "NTA\n\nShe makes comments to you about your \"privilege.\" You are just engaging in some dialogue with her and your POV on a boarder level than just school.\n\nI think you are good dude.", "Both sexism and racism are structural, and there are a lot more white women in STEM than Black men. So if half your colleagues are men (who are socialised in male privilege and sexist) but 80% of your colleagues are white people (who are socialised in white privilege and racism) A's focus on male privilege while ignoring race privilege shows that she sees discrimination only when it affects her (cf \"white feminism\").\n\nWhat's more is that it's doubtful that the 20% POC are all Black. Anti-Blackness is something that extends well beyond white people. OP has no guarantee of a racism-free space among his non-white colleagues in general. NTA", "NTA, it\u2019s 2023 and she hasn\u2019t heard of intersectional identities?", "NTA. She\u2019s very much privileged as a white woman in the US (and I\u2019m a white woman in the US). Yes, women overall in the US deal with our issues such as not having bodily autonomy, much more sexual assault and harassment, unequal wages in certain sectors, etc. But I definitely know I have privilege for being white. I don\u2019t have to worry about my son being harassed or even murdered for simply doing every day things. I don\u2019t have to worry about moving around in majority white rural areas. I don\u2019t worry about discrimination based solely on the type of name I have. I could go on. But your buddy is definitely in the wrong if she thinks that you have much more privilege than her outside of academia. \n\nIMO, the order of amount of privilege in the US is like\n\n1.\tWhite men\n2.\tWhite women\n3.\tPOC men\n4.\tPOC women\n\nThat\u2019s not taking into account economic status but even then, a white person has more than POC in terms of systemic issues. Anyway, it sounds like your buddy has been pretty sheltered from the realities of POC people in the US and she needs to open her eyes up to the fact that race is still an issue that plays a big part in a lot of things, especially depending where the person lives. Like I live in Indianapolis which has a very diverse population, but the rest of Indiana is not great\u2026(especially since the KKK had a huge presence in the state). \n\nSo, again, NTA. I think your buddy would benefit from an class about race in America.", "NTA\n\nPrivilege is nuanced. People experience it in different ways and different areas. You were correct in pointing that out. That said, I think you could have worded it better than trying to argue who has it worse, since this is so dependent on individual circumstances and situations. I think your claim that she has more privilege in most areas outside STEM is an overgeneralization. However, I don't think you were being an AH, as she was the one who first started the \"who has it worse\" type argument, and she should have been more open to having a conversation about intersectionality if she wants to talk about issues of identity. It sounds like she was the one who refused to acknowledge her own privilege.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
