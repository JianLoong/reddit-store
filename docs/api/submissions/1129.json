So we both don\u2019t want him to go with us because of that but last night my mum started an argument about it saying that he should be going. So we argued about it I called her names and she did to.

So much drama. Happy bd.", "NTA. But why are you stressed? It sounds like cancelling it would be for the best anyway. Now you can make your own birthday plans that are free of these people.", "First of all, happy birthday. You don't know me, and I don't know you, but I wish you a day full of all the things you want with no complications.\n\nNTA. You are not a brat, you want what you were promised, a weekend away with your family, but the brother who drinks too much is complicating that. Yes, you could be more supportive of your drunk brother, but also that is not your job. You're just asking for what you were promised, and turning 18 doesn't mean you're automatically able to deal with an alcoholic brother. You're allowed to be disappointed that your birthday was cancelled.", "Thank you lol", "I\u2019m stressed out because everyone in my family is calling me a selfish brat because I don\u2019t want there to be problems on my 18th", "Thanks alot and I\u2019ve tried to be supportive for 5 years but now I\u2019m done after he woke my brother up at 5AM to tell him he hates him and wants him to unalive himself"]}
