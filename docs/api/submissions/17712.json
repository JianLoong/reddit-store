My sister who's 27 has three young boys, both me and my eldest have none. So for Christmas last year, 27 only got presents for her 3 boys, and no one else in the family. She doesn't work and money is tight, but it was a bit insulting considering a box of chocolates is only \u00a35. (It's the thought that counts). Yet she spent nearly \u00a3100 on the 3 boys. So, our fathers birthday comes around and she's not gotten him anything. Then it's the eldest sisters birthday. She didn't get her anything. I did. Now, both me and 29 are in development l decently paid jobs and can afford these things whereas 27 will struggle. Now, I managed get something from a friend who'd been given something in a charity shop they work at which I thought was a perfect gift for 27. I'm now thinking of giving it away as I didn't pay anything for it as I don't think my thoughts and efforts will be reciprocated when it's my birthday. WIBTA if I gave it away on the basis of, if she's not giving gifts then why should I send her one?\n\nEdit: I pay for stuff like Netflix, prime etc that she also uses. I've payed for her and the boys when we've had meals out for family gatherings and just only 3 weeks after I passed my driving test and got my car she was asking me to do a 45 minute journey just so she could get some lego off of Facebook Market place for herself. So it's not that I don't do anything for her, it's the fact it feels like it's not appreciated.", "created_utc": 1684536680, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13maeyf/wibta_for_not_giving_a_birthday_present/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being 27 and having three young kids must be absolute madness, especially if money is tight.

A birthday present should be a thoughtful gesture, and from my point of view, it is not something you should expect. However, in your sister's situation, I wouldn't be too strict about it, as you mentioned that she cannot afford to spend much and she has three boys to care for, so it makes sense that she prioritizes them over anyone else.

But you're allowed to be an A if you want.\n\nTALK to your sister. Tell her that you've noticed that she has stopped giving gifts to the adult family in her life and ask her whether she needs help. For example, maybe she could contribute \u00a35 towards the gift you give and it can be a joint gift.
