Jaccob is living with me while we go to college since his parents agreed to pay his half of the rent if we lived together.

Jaccob has a larger appetite than me so he usually gets more than I do when we go shopping. \r  \n\r  \nThis has become a problem recently as Jaccob started running out of food and would start stealing mine instead. At first it was small things like bags of chips or fruit so I didn\u2019t really comment on it, but then it started getting out of hand. I would go shopping for things like bread or cereal only for them to be completely gone two days later without me even getting any. I confronted Jaccob about this once before, and he simply shrugged it off and said he hadn\u2019t had a chance to go to the store yet. \r  \n\r  \nThis morning I finally had enough. I had gone shopping over the weekend and already my chips, oatmeal, cereal, and iced tea were either completely gone or nearly empty. I had barely even opened them and already I was almost out. Jaccob came into the kitchen while I was trying to make myself breakfast and immediately reached for my box of cereal, emptying the rest of it out. I groaned at this and asked him to please leave some of my food for me. When he asked what I meant I proceeded to list off everything of mine he stole and begged him to get his own food instead of always stealing mine because he eats it all before I get a chance and I couldn\u2019t afford to keep feeding both of us. Jaccob seemed to get offended by this and asked if I was insulting his eating habits, which was obviously not the case. I tried explaining that I simply couldn\u2019t afford to keep paying for food I didn\u2019t even get to eat and reminded him that he had the funds to buy whatever he wanted. There was no reason I could think of for him to take mine instead of buying what he wanted. \r  \n\r  \nJaccob got pretty snappy after I said that and once again accused me of judging his habits. He went off about how he was an adult and was allowed to do whatever he wanted in his own home and he didn\u2019t need me policing him. He would do what he wanted with his money and he could eat whatever he wanted without me making him feel bad about it.

If you can't rely on your own funds to supply your own food needs, how the hell do you expect me to? You get an allowance. I do not.

Dude. You JUST ate the last of my cereal. Where's your food? Where's ANYTHING you bought? Show me receipts.\"\n\nNTA, btw. That would piss me off (as evidenced by my rant). You need to set up a new system and it's going to include hiding your food/storing it locked up. You can buy locked fridge boxes for fridge food and a trunk for pantry food. Or he can grow up.", "NTA. Based on his entitled attitude though, I would start storing as much stuff as you can in your room. Either put a lock on whatever you store it in (cabinet, bin etc), or put a lock on your door so he can\u2019t go in when you are not at home. You can buy an outside locking door knob from any hardware store for cheap.

You clearly said your concern was financial but he\u2019s trying to turn it around into you judging him because that\u2019s easier for him to argue against. Not only is that manipulative but it\u2019s also insulting.

A roommate might not be as forgiving. I know I had roommates at that age that would not have put up with it at all.\n\nYou definitely should inform his parents. However, I would suggest making it less \"you need to get cousin to stop eating my food\" and more \"if his current attitude continues, I may need to re-evaluate this living arrangement\". \n\nIt may seem like a jump to go straight to that. But his attitude is very disrespectful. It goes beyond food. It smacks of just not having any respect for you at all.

Or any of the other common courtesies of living with roommates.\n\nBeing upfront that its already starting to not work will help if things do fully unravel.\n\nI would also be leery of any suggestions that they pay for your groceries in the future. It is unlikely to stop your cousin from thinking he can just eat whatever. With the comments he made about how he spends his money, he may take it as license to be even more greedy about what he takes.\n\nThat's not to say that they shouldn't offer to compensate you for the food he's already eaten.

Firstly he's saying he can do whatever he wants with his money, except it's your money. Start charging him for everything he eats that you didn't until he gets the idea.\n\nSTart checking how much he brings back from the grocery store, my guess is he's stopped buying food because he's spending grocery money on going out, alcohol/other things and is using you to make up the difference.", "This is ridiculous. As an adult he can not eat your food. If he lived with someone that wasn\u2019t family he\u2019d be way in for it.

It\u2019s expensive and completely screws up budgeting.\n\nI wonder if OP could talk to his parents since they send him money for allowance on top of paying his rent/half of the bills. Maybe they would be willing to reimburse OP or find some way to help, whether it\u2019s buying OP a mini fridge or parenting their son. Yeah, he\u2019s an adult, but he\u2019s one that is taking advantage of OP and cares more about perceived fat shaming than actually realizing that OP is on a budget, doesn\u2019t have her life funded by her parents, and cannot afford to feed him.
