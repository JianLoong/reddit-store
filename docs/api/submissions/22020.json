Jaccob is living with me while we go to college since his parents agreed to pay his half of the rent if we lived together.

I confronted Jaccob about this once before, and he simply shrugged it off and said he hadn\u2019t had a chance to go to the store yet. \r  \n\r  \nThis morning I finally had enough. I had gone shopping over the weekend and already my chips, oatmeal, cereal, and iced tea were either completely gone or nearly empty. I had barely even opened them and already I was almost out. Jaccob came into the kitchen while I was trying to make myself breakfast and immediately reached for my box of cereal, emptying the rest of it out. I groaned at this and asked him to please leave some of my food for me. When he asked what I meant I proceeded to list off everything of mine he stole and begged him to get his own food instead of always stealing mine because he eats it all before I get a chance and I couldn\u2019t afford to keep feeding both of us. Jaccob seemed to get offended by this and asked if I was insulting his eating habits, which was obviously not the case. I tried explaining that I simply couldn\u2019t afford to keep paying for food I didn\u2019t even get to eat and reminded him that he had the funds to buy whatever he wanted.

He went off about how he was an adult and was allowed to do whatever he wanted in his own home and he didn\u2019t need me policing him. He would do what he wanted with his money and he could eat whatever he wanted without me making him feel bad about it.

If you can't rely on your own funds to supply your own food needs, how the hell do you expect me to? You get an allowance. I do not.

Dude. You JUST ate the last of my cereal. Where's your food? Where's ANYTHING you bought? Show me receipts.\"\n\nNTA, btw. That would piss me off (as evidenced by my rant). You need to set up a new system and it's going to include hiding your food/storing it locked up. You can buy locked fridge boxes for fridge food and a trunk for pantry food.

Either put a lock on whatever you store it in (cabinet, bin etc), or put a lock on your door so he can\u2019t go in when you are not at home. You can buy an outside locking door knob from any hardware store for cheap.

You clearly said your concern was financial but he\u2019s trying to turn it around into you judging him because that\u2019s easier for him to argue against. Not only is that manipulative but it\u2019s also insulting.
