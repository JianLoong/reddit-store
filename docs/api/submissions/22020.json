Jaccob is living with me while we go to college since his parents agreed to pay his half of the rent if we lived together. On top of paying for his rent and him working part time, Jaccob receives a weekly allowance from his mom to help him pay for groceries. I don\u2019t have the same luxury as I am paying for everything on my own. \r  \n\r  \nWe have an agreement living together that, unless we plan our meals together, we are responsible for our own food. Essentially he buys his own food and I buy my own, and we don\u2019t really share unless asking first. This system worked well for us, especially given our different financial situations and different dietary preferences/appetite levels. Jaccob has a larger appetite than me so he usually gets more than I do when we go shopping. \r  \n\r  \nThis has become a problem recently as Jaccob started running out of food and would start stealing mine instead. At first it was small things like bags of chips or fruit so I didn\u2019t really comment on it, but then it started getting out of hand. I would go shopping for things like bread or cereal only for them to be completely gone two days later without me even getting any. I confronted Jaccob about this once before, and he simply shrugged it off and said he hadn\u2019t had a chance to go to the store yet. \r  \n\r  \nThis morning I finally had enough. I had gone shopping over the weekend and already my chips, oatmeal, cereal, and iced tea were either completely gone or nearly empty. I had barely even opened them and already I was almost out. Jaccob came into the kitchen while I was trying to make myself breakfast and immediately reached for my box of cereal, emptying the rest of it out. I groaned at this and asked him to please leave some of my food for me. When he asked what I meant I proceeded to list off everything of mine he stole and begged him to get his own food instead of always stealing mine because he eats it all before I get a chance and I couldn\u2019t afford to keep feeding both of us. Jaccob seemed to get offended by this and asked if I was insulting his eating habits, which was obviously not the case. I tried explaining that I simply couldn\u2019t afford to keep paying for food I didn\u2019t even get to eat and reminded him that he had the funds to buy whatever he wanted. There was no reason I could think of for him to take mine instead of buying what he wanted. \r  \n\r  \nJaccob got pretty snappy after I said that and once again accused me of judging his habits. He went off about how he was an adult and was allowed to do whatever he wanted in his own home and he didn\u2019t need me policing him. He would do what he wanted with his money and he could eat whatever he wanted without me making him feel bad about it. Honestly, his outburst confused me because I don\u2019t think I was judging him, I just wanted to be able to enjoy the food that I bought for myself.

Depending of how you know them to be, if you think they'll baby him and ignore the issue, just start discreetly looking for any possible roomates and preare to kick him out.  I don'yt think it would stop with the food only and you can't keep locking every item of yours in your own home forever , that's just frustrating way to live.", "NTA\n\nClassic redirection.   Instead of addressing the issue of him stealing from you, he redirected it into you criticizing his eating habits.  He essentially played the \"Are you calling me  fat?\" card to \"Get out of Jail, free.\"\n\nContinue to stay on message with him. You can't afford to feed him.  You did not agree to feed him.  He cannot eat your food.  If it continues, the living arrangement will have to change.", "The kid is 19, has mommy buying his food and paying his half of rent, but he's an adult and \"Can do whatever he wants in his own home\". Kid, you're 19 and still being supported by your parents. You don't even pay the rent or buy food with your own money, it's far from your own home. \n\nNTA.

Request reimbursement. (Or eat his food for a few weeks while not buying anything if he wants to start a war.

I would consider asking him if everything is okay financially and see if there is a problem but it's your food where is his money going.  Maybe he isn't spending properly or if he will replace what he's taken when he does go to the store?  Either he's getting too comfortable and this isn't going to stop or there's an issue that needs to be addressed.  Either way it's his problem this is just if u want to be helpful towards a solution since it's family.", "NTA, he's a thief.", "NTA and he is a selfish, entitled AH. I suspect he's been spoiled all his life and never told no.\n\nI think you should invest in a lockable storage container and keep your dry food in it.  Maybe check thrift stores or ads for a mini refrigerator you can keep in your room. Keep your room locked. \n\nIf he doesn't like it, tell him his behavior led to it.", "NTA \u2014 Might be time to start keeping dry goods in your room and locking the door. Might consider a mini fridge too.\n\nEdit to add: Is it possible he has another habit such as a drug habit that is bleeding him dry and could be causing the weird change in behavior and attitude?", "NTA. You need to make other housing arrangements and either put a lock on a cupboard or keep food in your bedroom. Get a mini fridge and put a lock on your bedroom door.", "NTA  he knows what he was wrong and instead of owning up to it like an adult and say sorry and say he will go to the store and replace your items he decided to have a tantrum because he is embarrassed you asked him to stop.  I would sit down with him again when he isn't being such a baby and explain that it has nothing to do with how much or little he eats its the fact that you both agreed that your food is yours and his is his, the food you get is what you can afford and needs to last you, if he would like a bowl of cereal ask, if he eats almost all of something replace it because that is what an adult does.", "NTA by a long shot. Call his parents and have them reimburse you for the food he\u2019s eaten. When you shop again, place all your dry goods in a cabinet with a lock in your room. For stuff that needs to be in the fridge, I think there are plastic containers with locks you can order off of Amazon. That should keep him away from your food.", "He's got a good deal.\n\nHis parents pay his rent. His parents give him an allowance for food. And then he eats your food so he gets to keep his food allowance! \n\nDon't lock your food away. Yell bloody murder at him for eating your food and stealing! your money. \n\nTell him the deals off and he needs to buy his own damn food, replace ALL the food he stole or move out immediately.\n\nTell his parents too. They might actually pay you back. \n\nAnd let me guess, he doesn't do his share of the housework either does he?", "NTA. You\u2019re asking him to stick to the agreement you have set in place. Being an adult does my give me free reign to do whatever he wants when he\u2019s sharing spaces with others. Definitely look into ways to separate and lock up your food.", "Could he be eating your food because he is spending his food allowance money on other things he doesn't want his parents to know about?\n\nETA: NTA. Natural consequences work best. Keep your food where he can't access it.", "NTA- Tell him separate foods now.\n\nYou can tell him you don't care what he eats, as long as he pays for it.\n\nBut you can't afford to cover his food anymore.", "NTA. To hell with this leech; cupboard locks, lockable storage, find a way to lock a fridge, whatever. Or talk to his mom and she can give you an allowance too", "NTA He may be a legal adult, but he's acting like a child. He's even still getting an allowance from mommy.  You need to be a lot firmer with him otherwise he's going to walk all over you about everything.   Don't tell him to leave you some of your own food, tell him to keep his hands off all of your food.\n\nSince he probably won't listen,  you could start keeping your food in your room and locking it.  But I think the more fun option might be to contact his mom and tell her that she must not be paying him enough because he's constantly taking all your food and seems to always be hungry. Make sure to include in there that you have told him to stop, but he's just so hungry he won't listen. \n\nEdited for clarity.", "He can eat whatever HE BUYS.

If possible move out ASAP he is an awful rude thoughtless inconsiderate sh\\*thead", "it sounds like he isn't even purchasing food, and spending it on other things.  \n\nI might talk to your aunt and uncle and explain how this impacts you. \n\nNTA", "NTA,\nBut you need stronger boundaries. \nInstead of\n\"Please leave some of my food for me\"\nIt needs to be\n\"Keep your hands off my food!\"", "NTA.  He's being an entitled shit.  Time to get some cupboard locks.", "NTA. Call his parents and tell them he is not honoring your agreement. If he can't act like an adult, treat him like a child.", "NTA\n\nHe has a job and gets extra money from his parents, on top of him not paying any bills himself. So what is he spending that money on? His parents need to know that he\u2019s not spending the money they give him on necessities.", "Put a lock on the cupboard and call his mom. Nta", "NTA He's delusionally afraid to shop for the amount of food he wishes to consume and wants you to pay to preserve his ego. Chances are he has a nutrient deficiency that he's unaware of and unlikely to address. If you have the presence of mind to do so you should change your diet to make it less appealing to the scrounger. Good luck", "Air tight totes to put chips, cereal, crackers in. Not just loose on a shelf in her room. A sealed tote will prevent any insect infestation. Some common bugs are able to chew through aluminum foil, Mylar, heavy plastics.
