We live in a household of 5.  Ages 30,25,4,3 and 2 months.  My fiance brings in anywhere from 2000-2400 a month hours dependant and I do not work due to the costs of childcare outweighing an additional check at this time.  We currently recieve rental assistance, Medicaid, and recently 600$ a month in EBT.\n\n\nMy father's reasoning:  He is currently working factory work making nearly double what my fiance brings in but he had 1 week of shutdown in November and is facing 3 weeks of shutdown in the end of December.  He wife makes enough of social security to pay rent and her adult child stays with them and aids in utilities and buys his own food.  They are not eligible for assistance due to making nearly 50,000 a year just two adults.  \n\nMy reasoning:  My father requested to pay me $50 for $100 in food stamps.  I told him no as I am uncomfortable with that because it's fruad and I can lose my benefits.  My father also has a gambling issue and is constantly buying marijuana nearly if not weekly.  I am worried if I tell him yes he will continue to ask me when he is back working but spent too much of his money and needs bailed out.  I love my father dearly and I don't want to see them without food so I offered a $100 gift card to a grocery store instead.\n\nMy father refused and was furious telling me he was returning the toys he bought my children so he can use it on food and was canceling Christmas with us.  He would no longer attend Christmas dinner or see the grandchildren.  He is convinced we are living the easy life due to our financial aid but we are in debt and struggle to pay our other finances as is.

Your food stamps are to help your family with your food needs and you are eligible because you need it; it's not for your father for anything (and offering you half the value - despite being illegal - is also insulting). Does he think you have so much extra to give away?", "NTA He makes plenty of money to tide him over. He doesn't need help from you, he needs to stop gambling and cut back on his smoking if he needs to. \n\nThere is no need for him to dip his hand into your pocket when you are getting benefits because you genuinely qualify for them (there's a good reason he doesn't). Shame on him. You may love him, but that doesn't mean you need to enable him. In actuality you would end up hurting everyone by enabling him. Entitlement on his side and resentment on yours would build up.\n\nNip this in the bud now. It won't get better if if you give in to stop him throwing a fit now -- caving would just mean slowly fostering a bigger problem between you.", "NTA it is fraud and you need the assistance more than him. Let him throw his tantrum, I highly doubt he'll follow through with his threats", "NTA. Those food benefits are because YOUR household doesn\u2019t make enough to supply its needs.  Your father\u2019s issue is mismanagement, and we don\u2019t generally give government aid for that because everyone is responsible for using their income responsibly.  If you got caught, you\u2019d lose aid your family needs.  One is almost never TA for refusing to actively break the law to benefit someone else.\n\nIt\u2019s appalling that he\u2019s punishing your children because you\u2019re rightly refusing to take food from their mouths to support his vices.", "NTA, if you were living the easy life, you wouldn't have been approved for EBT. You offered a very kind and reasonable solution and he refused it. Sounds like he was planning to use more than $100 on your card. And to use your children and Christmas against you like that? Dad is a total AH!", "NTA. If he refused the voucher, his intentions are not legit. If he really wants food and struggles, he should have been very happy. You have 3 kids to take care of and shouldn't risk their food and future for a dad like that.", "NTA\n\nYour father is a massive AH and he should be ashamed of the way he's acting.\n\nStand your ground and never let anyone else use your benefits.\n\nHopefully you and your husband can get on your feet enough that there won't be any more benefits for your father to harass you about. Though, I suspect he'll start in on what you 'owe' him for raising you at that point...\n\nETA: Also, reading back, did he really offer to give you only $50 to use $100 in benefits???", "NTA\n\nYour benefits are for you, not your father's family.  He is welcome to go to the food pantry and get some food there.\n\nIf possible, you should apply for charitable help for gifts for your kids so they have a good Christmas with or without their grandfather's help.", "NTA. You are in a situation where you need those services based on your state's rules. Do NOT share your EBT with anyone. Those benefits are for you and you alone (your immediate family).", "NTA. You\u2019re absolutely correct that it is fraud and that you can lose your benefits. There\u2019s also no reason that a person who legitimately needs food would insist on using your EBT card instead of a grocery store gift card. It\u2019s clearly for some other reason.", "NTA. Your dad is a sleazy crook who doesn't care what happens to you or your family.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. He\u2019s attempting to gaslight and manipulate you by threatening not to see your kids or give them Christmas gifts. By doing that he doesn\u2019t deserve to see them. They don\u2019t need that kind of toxic BS in their lives. Not to mention someone in their lives that\u2019s trying to take food out of their mouths", "NTA. He's probably mad because he wanted to sell your stamps for gambling money from \"a guy he knows.\"", "NTA - Those benefits are to make sure that you and your children eat, not to supply your dad with gambling money and weed.  And you are quite correct to be worried about the consequences for assisting fraud here.  Any grandfather who would take this attitude because you don't want to leave your children at risk for not having food is a total AH and frankly should not be surprised when he is suddenly no longer welcome.  You don't need this level of selfish toxicity around you or your kids.", "Nta! He can be mad all he wants. That's super petty of him", "NTA. Your father is not a good person - his addiction has pushed him away from what he once was. He is literally trying to steal food from his grandchildren\u2019s mouths. I wouldn\u2019t trust someone that low in my house, frankly. I\u2019d almost bet that he\u2019d either already returned or never bought gifts and gambled the money.", "NTA. It's fraud. That is all be needs to know.", "NTA it\u2019s a crime to do that. Get caught have a record and benefits could be gone. I doubt he had any presents bought to begin with.", "NTA, honestly its probably best if your dad stays away from your kids anyway", "NTA. You get the EBT for a reason and you are right to deny your father access to it.\n\nIf you are found out, you will lose your benefits. As you stated, your father might make a habit of asking / demanding this assistance from you while you can barely afford things yourself.\n\nYour father gets an option and denies it which tells me he doesn't want to use the money for food. Most people who are really in need of food will jump at the chance of getting a gift card with money from a grocery store.  \nHim refusing to visit you and his grandchildren and returning their gifts is to force you into compliance.\n\nHonestly, He is the major AH at this point. He is now using your children as a weapon against you.   \nDon't fall for it.", "NTA and your dad was up to some REALLY shady S- he was either planning to A) spend more than $100 on your card without consultating you or B) was planning on selling them to someone else so he could gamble also he probably already returned/sold/or never bought those xmas presents you know that right? You\u2019re right not to trust your dad fraud aside and the fraud alone is a BIG deal if he genuinely just wanted to spend $100 worth of groceries on your card he would\u2019ve been leaping with joy to receive that gift card but he didn\u2019t because that wasn\u2019t his plan", "Yep.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Addicts, while not in recovery, will lie and hurt anyone (especially the people they love) to get their fix. Be it gambling, drugs, alcohol, etc. Addiction makes people cruel and selfish. It is a disease and he likely needs help to beat it. But it is not your job. Your job is to take care of yourself and your family (partner and kids). \n\nThe fact that he reacted so strongly in the negative to your refusal and immediately went nuclear is your tell-tale sign that he was not really asking for help with food. He sees you and your EBT as a means to an end, namely to help him get what he wants as a fix. He\u2019s willing to take food from you and your kids, and from his own household, to make himself happy in the short term (be it with weed, gambling, spending, etc.). Especially if he\u2019s gonna try and launder the benefits via gift cards and also only give you 50% of what they\u2019re worth. It reads like a poorly thought out scam. \n\nIf the relationship falters over this it is 100% his fault. \n\nDo NOT let him use you or your benefits. Your gut instinct is right and it is wrong for so many reasons. He will not stop at \u201cjust this once\u201d. His anger shows he already felt entitled to it!

I recommend responding with understanding.\n\n\"If you are having tough financial times, we completely understand changing Christmas plans. Ensuring everyone is safely housed and fed is priority one for us all. Sadly, if we share the EBT card, we can be prosecuted for fraud, adding new expenses none of us can afford and taking away a necessary source of food. When times are tough we all have to do the responsible thing, and if that means returning some gifts, that's what it means.\"\n\nCompletely refuse to acknowledge the rationale behind his tantrum. Allow him to exile himself as long as he feels necessary. Also you offered him a grocery gift card instead, his tantrum isn't even about money, but that you didn't immediately say yes to his outrageous demands exactly as he wanted them."]}
