I am worried if I tell him yes he will continue to ask me when he is back working but spent too much of his money and needs bailed out.

He doesn't need help from you, he needs to stop gambling and cut back on his smoking if he needs to. \n\nThere is no need for him to dip his hand into your pocket when you are getting benefits because you genuinely qualify for them (there's a good reason he doesn't).

Your father\u2019s issue is mismanagement, and we don\u2019t generally give government aid for that because everyone is responsible for using their income responsibly.  If you got caught, you\u2019d lose aid your family needs.

He's probably mad because he wanted to sell your stamps for gambling money from \"a guy he knows.\"", "NTA - Those benefits are to make sure that you and your children eat, not to supply your dad with gambling money and weed.  And you are quite correct to be worried about the consequences for assisting fraud here.

Your father is not a good person - his addiction has pushed him away from what he once was. He is literally trying to steal food from his grandchildren\u2019s mouths.

You\u2019re right not to trust your dad fraud aside and the fraud alone is a BIG deal if he genuinely just wanted to spend $100 worth of groceries on your card he would\u2019ve been leaping with joy to receive that gift card but he didn\u2019t because that wasn\u2019t his plan", "Yep.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your job is to take care of yourself and your family (partner and kids). \n\nThe fact that he reacted so strongly in the negative to your refusal and immediately went nuclear is your tell-tale sign that he was not really asking for help with food.
