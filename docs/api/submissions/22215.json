My dad then started \"boys night\" where he takes my brothers out for dinner once a month to a nice restaurant and I am not welcome because I am not a boy. My husband was invited and went a few times but stopped going because he could see it was upsetting me.  I have told my dad that this hurt my feelings to be not included because of my gender.  My dad said he had wanted to do this for many years and my mom stopped him.  He also resents me because my mom died even though her death was natural causes.  My brother says it's really important that dad has this and it has since expanded to include my male cousins and second cousins.  I have no biological female family members alive in my state as my aunt died shortly after my mom, grandma is dead, one female cousin in college and three female cousins out of state.  My dad told me I should just do girls night with the females who married into the family, who he has always bad mouthed.  I feel ostracized and cut off from my family.  I basically feel like when my mom died I lost both parents.  Every time I see my dad he talks about how great the food they have at boys night is, the great times they have, and how close they are becoming by hanging out regularly.  When we had a family get together for Father's day my dad insisted in getting a picture of just the boys.  No girls in the picture and went on about how great a time he has with them and how close they are. \n\nI know he's lonely and hurting because my mom died and then his sister died.  But every time I go to a family get together it feels like he is rubbing this stuff in my face and trying to hurt me.  His personality is the type to want to 'punish' people in subtle ways. \n\nThere is no solution in telling him how I feel. I have made the fact that this hurts me very clear.  My brothers won't support me and have even told me boys night would be no fun if I was allowed because I'm a drag. I was also told I could plan family night but it would need to be at someone's house, someone should cook food, someone must provide activities, a menu, etc.\n\nI'm not sure how to handle this because it repeatedly makes me upset and I'm tired of letting it bother me. I feel upset every time there is a family gathering and my dad brings boys night up repeatedly.  I'm thinking of just stopping doing family gatherings, Christmas, Thanksgiving,  to stop dealing with the emotions of it.

At least one member of your family has *told* you, directly, that he doesn't want to hang out with you because hanging out with you is unpleasant. And the rest of your family has shown in their actions that they think the same. You don't have to believe that they're in the right to think that way about you--after all you do have a husband who apparently cares about you--but you should believe that they mean what they say and do.\n\nSome advice and a warning: if you stop showing up to family gatherings, you should be prepared to discover that they don't care or are even glad that you didn't come. At first, that will hurt you tremendously, more than you've been hurt by them so far. If you can stick it out, that hurt will fade, you can start focusing on the people who do love and care for you, and you will be happier than you are now. But you should still go into it expecting that cutting yourself off from your family won't be the punishment for them that you might hope it will be.", "NTA this would make me go completely mental and absolutely go NC.

It's okay...they have already done it to you.", "Hon, you need a therapist. Your dad is terrible, you are grieving, and you have no support from your siblings.
