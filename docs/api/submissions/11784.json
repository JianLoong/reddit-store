Now, I am curious OP.  What are the ethnicities of the parties involved?  Because your story started ringing some \u201csouthern\u201d alarm bells from my past.  It was incredibly common among older, racist, white southerners to NEVER allow anyone into their pools that weren\u2019t Caucasian.  It was considered \u201cdirty\u201d.

Or that\u2019s what the mum is thinking would happen. They sound like lovely people /s.", "OP these are not your ILs and I\u2019d look carefully at BFs reaction to your complaint before getting to the point where these people would be your ILs. \n\nNTA", "So the men are so poorly behaved they are physically unable to control themselves if they see a female in a bathing suit? NTA", "NTA. What century are we living in??", "These parents sound like some psychos", "NTA. \n\nBut consider this, the attitude behind that rule is deeply rooted in sexism and misogyny and since families marry families, if you stay with your boyfriend and eventually marry him you will be marrying into a family where sexism and misogyny are normal and accepted. \n\nThis means that you will be except to comport yourself and follow those sexist rules in the name of not making waves and not rocking the boat. As your boyfriend's behavior has shown while he might disagree with them he won't support you if you choose to distance yourself from them. \n\nAnd this doesn't take into account any \"rules\" they might suddenly make up in the future or attitudes and beliefs they are going to teach and impart to your future children if you choose to have them.\n\nThink for a moment, are those the type of attitudes you want to be taught to your future son/ and or daughter?\n\nI'm not saying you dump your boyfriend over this, but this is a major inflection point in your relationship and it has major implications for how your future together will play out. \n\nJust ask yourself, is this what you want to be dealing with for the next 40+ years of your life if you stay together and eventually get married?", "I agree that this is the vibe I was getting! \n\nOP I\u2019m truly sorry if this is what the true cause of their \u201crule\u201d is.", "Hispanic and they are originally from pa and moved to Fl.", "You went to racism first? Wow. You should audition for Superman because you make leaps and bounds like no one else.", "Sink to their level and blow up everything\u2026 got it", "They must think they are living in the 1900s still", "1000% I bet you just hit the nail on the head. \n\nNTA, OP. They are punishing you for their issues. BUT, your BF needs to be more firm on this- they treat you like a human and nothing less because of your gender, or you BOTH refuse to go over ever again. He needs to be behind you on this, or your out.", "They all complied and his mother to make \u201camends\u201d I guess told me and the other few women that we could go to the community pool down the street.", ">The strangest part of this story is your BF wanting you in the pool, and right off the bat seems to be asshole behavior.\n\nWanting his gf to come out to where the fun is instead of being coerced into housework is AH behavior??", "I totally agree, NTA. My reasoning is that it was not just any swimsuit. It was a 1 piece swimsuit that was chosen with the intention of being respectful.", "Obviously the dad expected the women to stay in the kitchen while the ~~boys~~ men talked \"business\".", "They\u2019ve never done this to me before but I\u2019ve heard them tell me stories about how they treated there children similarly. They even tried to justify this behavior by saying that they did the same to their daughter and they are only doing this to me because they are \u201cprotecting me\u201d idk from who I guess their guests? It honestly doesn\u2019t make sense to me. \ud83d\ude41", "Right! I kept thinking \u201cI hope she doesn\u2019t actually refer to them as her \u201cin laws\u201d. Stop playing wife when you\u2019re treated as less than an equal human to your bf bc you\u2019re a woman. Red flags for this family all around. Also not sure why you didn\u2019t want to tell your bf initially why you weren\u2019t going in the pool. His parents are AH", "I would never go there again ever, apology or not. The boyfriend should be an ex after he expected OP to just accept that treatment again. He should have left with her right away.", "Could you imagine them as grandparents? What a toxic nightmare.", ">He noticed my odd behavior and when I finally told him the truth he was pissed. He told his parents they were outta line and that the \u201crule\u201d was unnecessary and stupid.\n\nIt's weird because it totally sounded like he had her back and then just wussed out when push came to shove.", "Nope, they are self proclaimed Christian\u2019s that don\u2019t either read the Bible or go to church. \u263a\ufe0f", "I lived in Florida when I was in high school and my friends and I used to go to the grocery store in bikinis. Literally no one batted an eye.", "I don't think it's necessarily hypocritical to have the reaction of \"I can't believe my parents made up this BS rule and won't let you in the pool. That's ridiculous!\" and also have the reaction of \"I understand that the rule was stupid, but I think you're overreacting to say that you never want to go to their house ever again.\"\n\nI'm firmly on team NTA, but I don't think the boyfriend is necessarily trying to manipulate or gaslight her, he just doesn't think that the offense reaches the level of \"we're never going to my parents house again.\"", "Lol not that this makes it any better but they were referring to their \u201cguests\u201d being uncomfortable.", "She respected their decision. And now she's making an informed decision to not return to the home of sexist a-holes. How is she the AH?", "I don't get this take? I agree their house their rules, she did not break them or even argue with them about the rules. What I don't understand is if the parents are allowed to have their rules that make OP feel less then why is she then not allowed to refuse to go there?", "No they are Christian\u2019s but they don\u2019t go to church or read the Bible from what I\u2019ve gathered over the seven years I\u2019ve been with my bf.", "I may be wrong, but my spidey senses are telling me that it\u2019s a lot more than misogyny.", "They are Christian\u2019s but they don\u2019t read the Bible or go to church. So yes and no?", ">\u201cnot your monkeys, not your circus\u201d\n\nWTF? This is something that literally happened *to her*. She was discriminated against because of her gender. This is the exact definition of HER monkeys, HER circus. This is drama she is directly involved in and needs to fight for justice.\n\nThe rest of your comment is so out of line with your initial claim, I have a sneaking suspicion that you don't actually know what the phrase means.", "Me and my bf have been together for seven years now. He\u2019s changed a lot. He isn\u2019t misogynistic at all, at least around me. I nip that shit in the butt all the time. I\u2019m independent and unapologetic at the fact that I am responsible, intelligent, and acceptant of others. His family for a while now have been like this toward me making sly comments when I bring up an interesting fact by saying a back handed compliment like \u201cumm\u2026 (insert my name) how do you even know all this stuff. What do you do exactly on your free time?\u201d And laugh like it\u2019s some joke and I\u2019m this nerdy weirdo. They\u2019ve told me to my face that I\u2019m odd and weird but they always say \u201cit\u2019s outta love\u201d.", "This should be the top comment.", "Ok, thank you for the response.  Then yeah, thankfully not that I guess.  But they\u2019re still pretty \u201cout there\u201d with the misogynist view points.", "No, just raised around a lot of that stuff.  That\u2019s the point of dog whistles.  They aren\u2019t meant to be understood by everyone, just those that know.  How fortunate for you to never be exposed to that I guess.", "Do people think women weren't allowed in pools in the 1900s?", "WHAT????? And let you and the ladies go undefended while you go to a strange pool with strange men that will be distracted and possibly get unhinged around you???????? They went from from favoring men to hating women right there if this \u2018distraction\u2019 crappola holds any water. \n\nDoes bf mom have to go the public pool too?\n\nIf bf knows this and still says you\u2019re overdramatic, I\u2019d throw a shoe at his head and start looking back to see if there is any concerning past behavior that you\u2019ve overlooked", "Hahaha you got to admit, this is funny.", "Yes. \"I would like you to be in the pool\" is different than wanting someone to be included, and I think it is weird to be directing her behavior at a party. She's 24, that's weird for someone to be told to stop what they're doing and get in a pool, when that's something they can decide for themselves.\n\nThe whole story seems problematic, with OP being treated in a submissive manner, and being told to get in the pool was the first part that seemed off to me.", "Banning you from swimming because of their smarmy friends isn't protecting you. Protecting you would mean them never speaking to these friends again. They are victim blaming and it's gross.", "Especially with a female grandchild?", "Good old family values christians probably with their new religious book being fox news tbh", "Lol nah the fathers a perv and they framed it as a \u201cguests\u201d thing.", "Lol, like the husband having cheated before is a bigger deal than misogyny?\n\nNo. Misogyny is the primary issue here whether you like it or not.", "They\u2019ve told me that I\u2019m odd and werid and that my perspective on the world is not \u201cnormal\u201d in comparison to there\u2019s. I\u2019m a nerd, I like reading and learning and sharing what I learn. They\u2019ve told me, by that I mean my bf brought to my attention, that multiple times over the course of 7 years being with my bf that \u201cmy facts\u201d  making them uncomfortable and that \u201cnot everyone likes being told they are wrong\u201d. I don\u2019t do it to be mean I\u2019m usually really excited to share what I know. I\u2019ve since stopped sharing so much because of this plus they\u2019ll sometimes flat out say \u201cno, you don\u2019t know what your talking about.\u201d", "So they\u2019re just insane then. Ok good to know. May want to run from that family.", "This IS her circus.", "You handled everything with such class, and articulated reality to your partner on the way home.

If you guys marry, this will get even worse because he\u2019s already indicated he\u2019s going to back down if his parents force him to choose. This crap will also extend to any daughters you might have. NTA.", "OP, they disrespect and mock you to your face, tell you women can't swim because it'll distract the men, and put you in sexist roles? Your future inlaws are  A-Hs, and they moved to Florida because they agree with the current political atmosphere.\n\nYou're NTA, but bf should see his parents for who they really are.", "Hmm. I personally didn't take it that way but I see how it could have been", "I think you misunderstood.  Oh I\u2019m sure misogyny is involved to a degree, but I asked OP in a comment about the ethnicities of the parties involved.  She hasn\u2019t replied yet, but the story started ringing some alarm bells for me, due to the fact that it was incredibly common in the South for racist white folks, especially of older generations, to now allow anyone into their pools that aren\u2019t Caucasian.  They viewed it as \u201cdirty\u201d.  I heard that stuff from people during the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s while I was growing up.  I\u2019ve heard folks saying shit like that since then.  I could easily see the parents feeling that way, but trying to hide it behind misogyny\u2026due to somehow that being \u201cbetter\u201d in their view."]}
