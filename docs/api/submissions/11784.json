Now, I am curious OP.  What are the ethnicities of the parties involved?  Because your story started ringing some \u201csouthern\u201d alarm bells from my past.  It was incredibly common among older, racist, white southerners to NEVER allow anyone into their pools that weren\u2019t Caucasian.  It was considered \u201cdirty\u201d.  Is it a possibility that this was their issue and they didn\u2019t want to just come out and say it?

If marriage is the route you were hoping to travel down with him, I would seriously wonder what that would look like. Imagine if you two had a daughter someday and she was told the same thing?

And then you should have left.\n\nBut I understand why you stayed. Many women don\u2019t want to escalate, and start fights, especially with bf parents. But I can\u2019t imagine these people for ILs. Can you? The fact that your bf was initially pissed but then excused them with \u201cthey\u2019re old school\u201d is telling. It says that on some level he agrees with their misogynistic views.

Please leave this man or start laying down some very firm boundaries it's time for you to defend yourself as your bf clearly will not.", "it sounds like he\u2019s jealous of you. it sounds like this whole family doesn\u2019t deserve you. you have been with him so long, i can only imagine how afraid you must be of what a life would look like without him - but you sound DOPE. you\u2019d be amazing. just doing everything you want when you want. you\u2019re still SO young. i hope you find people who value you and kick it with them instead. we def all rooting for you", "I have thought about this many times and it honestly petrifies me because you aren\u2019t the first person to tell me this. My family has said this and even more shockingly some of his own relatives have told me this. They even see the way they talk about me usually making me the butt of the joke. Usually I\u2019m not doing anything but listening to a conversation maybe say one or two things just bouncing ideas off people but I always am the one that\u2019s pointed out for their ideas and feedback like it\u2019s a joke or weird.", ">Does bf mom have to go the public pool too?\n\nI was wondering that too. Do they have a pool for the father only?", "It was NOT about the guests.  Definitely FIL.  Definitely gross.  Never go there again.", "This. Ten times over.  \n\nThis isn't about whether or not YTA.  This should be about why, knowing what you know, you're still in this relationship. \n\nYou can't change other people, but you can work on yourself.", ">His parents are very authoritarian\n\nYour bf is showing signs of being an authoritarian, too. Maybe he's trying to change, but from what you wrote, he falls back into giving you orders pretty easily.", "OP, you need to have a serious sit down with him on how their behavior makes you feel, how you aren\u2019t comfortable being yourself around them, and why you don\u2019t want to be around them anymore. Explain it like he\u2019s five, because he sure isn\u2019t getting it.\n\nA good partner will listen to you, try their best to understand your feelings, and help you find a solution. If he isn\u2019t willing to do that, then you need to move on. \n\nYou are so young and have no kids with this person. Walk away now before you are tied to him one way or another, because the little incentive to change he has now will be completely gone. I know you\u2019ve invested a lot of time in this relationship and probably don\u2019t want to throw it away, but the time spent is irrelevant when your partner isn\u2019t being a good partner and refuses to change.", "For 7 years these people have been disrespecting you and he has basically been ok with it. You yourself said that he cowers down to them. If there was ever a serious situation do you think he'd have your back? because he hasn't in 7 years. Honestly they sound exhausting and you sound like you've had to keep proving to your bf and they're treating you incorrectly. Do you want to live the rest of your life with these people? constantly putting you down? \n\nNTA but please be kinder to yourself", ">even more shockingly some of his own relatives have told me this\n\nSo these are the people who know what is said behind your back. If there has been all this talk to you face, I can't even imagine the level of trash they are saying when you are not around. \n\nYour boyfriend must be someone incredible for you to put up with that level of drama from his family and for you to overlook the fact that he hasn't shut it down yet.", "I don\u2019t understand why this \u201cpetrifies\u201d you? If your family *and* his family are telling you the same thing, there\u2019s no reason to be petrified, you should be appreciative of the validation, and motivated to GTFO of that relationship. Are you scared to break up? Scared to be alone? Because otherwise, there is no reason to be scared by the confirmation that your bf\u2019s parents treat you badly, when you have the option to *walk away* from the relationship and no longer be the target of their garbage behavior.\n\nIt\u2019s time to stop being petrified, and make an adult decision here. Tell your bf you need some distance, because after the Florida trip you realize his parents are never going to treat you decently, and he is only going to make excuses or claim you are overreacting. Tell him his parents\u2019 behavior is unacceptable to you, period. You\u2019re not asking him to agree with you, you are telling what you feel and why you need to walk away. Then follow through. Separate yourself from him, and find a better therapist to help you work on your self-esteem.", "I\u2019m sorry OP.  Have you discussed this with your BF?", "How often do they call themselves \u201cfiscally conservative\u201d? Lol", "You\u2019ve got a \u201cbig heart,\u201d until it inconveniences him. And then he turns it into an insult to invalidate your feelings/needs, make you feel insecure, and manipulate you into shutting up and taking it.\n\nI\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the only instance of emotional abuse he uses to control you.", "Let me guess, when someone says something that bothers HIM, he gets really mad at being 'disrespected, and you have to  calm him down, right?\n\nDiscounting your feelings and genuine reactions to bad behavior is gaslighting. Making you walk on eggshells is abusive. His feeling mattering and yours not mattering is narcissism. I understand that you have put in a lot of time, but if he is growing colder and less supportive, forecast that a few years down the road and you're just locked into a family that ridicules you, puts you down, discounts your feelings and relegated you - and all women - to servant status. You deserve and can do SO much better!!!", "And they couldn\u2019t even the pool at the house they all were gathered at\u2026this is just gross.", "As a Native PA resident, their mentally makes SO much more sense now. Their level of being uncomfortable around you and your topics of discussion sounds like a personal problem - for them. \n\nMy husbands grandmother has lived in PA her whole life, she is very religious and conservative and would OFTEN bring up the election, politics, religion, health care etc. and I would give my opinions and facts on the topics, that seem to always oppose hers. We would hear from his parents later about her complaining about my POV and about being so not ideal for her grandson etc. they immediately started with asking us (mainly me) to avoid those topics of discussion and just not talk with her about it to make it easier for them. I immediately said no. I agreed that I will not bring it up on my own, but I will not sit quiet in a conversation when it is brought up. I\u2019d she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, than don\u2019t bring it up as a conversation topic. We haven\u2019t heard anything from them about it sense and she stopped bringing it up. \n\nThough my husband always supported me 1000% with it and stood on my side. Yours should really do the same.", "This, this, this. My husband would never in a million years let his parents talk to me that way. And if his mother said I couldn\u2019t use the pool, he would\u2019ve gotten out of the pool and we would have left.", "Not often. I\u2019d say maybe a handful of times.", "If your boyfriend doens't really see the issue then he won't in the future. This screams of guys with control issues, major misogyny and the kind of guy who gets you knocked up or married than changes completely once they think you're locked in. I'd run.\n\n\n\nHe grew up in that environment and willingly put you in it, feigned some support but can't see what your issue is in not wanting to go back.", "If he wouldn't stand up for you on this small thing he will absolutely be throwing you under the bus on big things like whether your daughters are treated like human beings or bodies that distract men. Might be time to cut your losses. Your future daughters deserve it.", "I mean, you already have proof he won't. You don't need a do-over to know where the chips will fall. \n\nOP, this is completely dehumanizing. It's not acceptable to any partner. You're NTA here but you are surrounded by them.", "&#x200B;\n\nBF:  The way you neglected to back me up at your parents worries me. You say you will back me up, but your actions are not showing that.   I have never heard of any \"old-school\" viewpoints that don't allow women to share a pool....unless your parents are secretly Hasidic jews and I am not aware?\n\nIf men are \"distracted\" by women that is on them, not the woman. Even Jesus said it is better to pluck their eyes out if it causes them to sin.\n\nI am not going to be in an environment that I am basically treated like the help...expected to serve food but not allowed to partake in any activities or amenities.", "There is no reason to believe that he'll support you in the near or far future.", "By deep dive do you mean run like hell, because that\u2019s what you need to do.", "Thank you for your understand and perspective I\u2019ll take your advice under consideration. It\u2019s greatly appreciated", "We've found the assholes who vote for DeSantis", "[hugs offered]\n\nI know that how your boyfriend and his parents treat you is not as bad as your dad and sister, but *it is still abuse.*\n\nYou deserve SO MUCH BETTER.\n\nYou deserve friends and partners who will geek out *with you*, who will listen with rapt attention when you infodump about your latest obsession because *it's cool stuff* and they also like to learn cool things so the things you say are INTERESTING and they want to hear MORE!!!\n\nYou deserve to be with someone who will tell *you* about the cool things *they* learned.\n\nMy first romantic relationship started my first semester in college and lasted 6 years. Looking back now, it's painful (and painfully obvious) to see how abusive it was, how much I changed myself to fit into the box he expected of me.\n\nI didn't know any better, and after a certain amount of time the sunk cost fallacy kicks in and \"well, we've been together this long...\" (plus, the constant low-key begging and \"nobody else will put up how clingy/annoying/needy you are\")\n\nSo maybe I'm projecting some of my stuff onto you, because I wish I could go back to me at your age and grab that Me by the shoulders and give Me a good shaking and told Me to wake up and realize what a piece of trash that guy was, and to start valuing myself more.\n\nSo [grabs you by the shoulders but gently and shakes you but WITH LOVE] \"You are too good and smart and beautiful and curious and caring and interesting and passionate for that guy!! You deserve happiness! You deserve someone who loves you *because* you are 'weird' not in spite of it!! You deserve someone who will respect you and value you, quirks and all!!!\"", "Remember, just because someone treats you better than your awful parents doesn't necessarily mean they're actually treating you well. These people aren't good to you, they're just less bad than your parents, you should never have to say that you're afraid of how someone might act in the future when they're supposed to love you unconditionally.", "This is one of the MOST ridiculous things I have ever heard.  They had a football draft pool party and half the people invited could not get in the pool?\n\nThen they took the women to a community pool? So, it\u2019s ok to distract men there? It\u2019s so f\u2019in weird. \n\nAlso, what were you painting? Was it an activity or was it free labor? Was it just to occupy you so you didn\u2019t go in the pool? \n\nYour bf may have been supportive in the beginning, but he\u2019s diminishing your feelings and their parents behavior. They are completely inappropriate, and I\u2019d worry as well about how they may sexualize or not treat a girl granddaughter equally.", "Wait, so it's ok for _strange men_ to see you swimming in a community/public pool, but not friends/family that are men???", "OP, I am hearing alarm bells-at the very least this is ridiculous and disrespectful", "So you're a \"distraction\" at the home pool but fine at the community pool where a man could show up at any time. Would you then all have to leave immediately?\n\nThis math ain't mathing.", "WTF? Is his mom allowed to swim in her own pool? If the answer is no, I'd bounce if my partner wasn't supporting me.", "She has a pool and yet she took the women to the community pool? There is more going on here. Does she think women are not clean, having periods etc.? Does she have any Islam background? Why did you go?", "I was wondering that myself. Maybe there's a secret sex offender in the family.", "And what about all the men who might visit the community pool? I'd be a lot more uncomfortable around strangers than friends and family.", "Or OP's FIL has a track record of doing things that must be kept secret at all times and definitely not challenged by seeing women with only 1 layer of clothing. \n\nThe fact that she took her swimming in a public pool and that was okay, makes me think the men in that family have a deep seated secret of violence and abuse.", "WTF?!"]}
