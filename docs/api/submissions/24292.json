My other siblings who all share the same thoughts and feelings, started to despise him as well. After I graduated college I moved out of my parents place to do what I wanted and not work around my brother. My mom would always message me saying I should text my brother because he was sad or upset and it would make his day. I never did. I do not have any feelings towards my older brother besides resentment and anger. He always had meltdowns during my big moments and I'm worried he will ruin my wedding.

Some of your examples, like him playing video games after he's \"tired\" are not evidence of anything. Autistic people often feel overwhelmed by social interactions (similar to how introverts get exhausted by them) and playing video games likely helps him unwind. It was YOUR MOM that could have scheduled things differently, the parent is really the host, not your brother, he's the guest. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan you talk to your brother in advance, in a kind way, about how important the day is? Or can you compromise and see if he can just go to the reception, and not the ceremony? Maybe he would see through that.

End of discussion. If you have a venue then definitely invest in security to escort him out if he shows up and it\u2019s necessary. He\u2019s capable of understanding why and you owe him nothing. It\u2019s your wedding not his.\n\nThat being said be prepared for the fallout from this.", "Tell her that she can either let you take over expenses or she can keep her reservations and you\u2019ll make new ones. If it comes down to it, you need to be ready to uninvite your mom who is part of the problem", "I totally understand the thought behind borrowing the money from them but then this is going to drag out for years while you pay her back. Do you really want to have that hanging over your head? \n\nOr do you want to have a wedding that maybe doesn't look exactly the way you like it but at least it's yours and your partner's?", "If they refuse to have the money returned to them, that's on them. Just tell them you'll hire security to keep him out if they continue to insist.", "Just cancel the wedding. You don\u2019t want one anyway and you\u2019re better off not being able to be manipulated by your mom because of funding. This wedding (or lack thereof) is about you and your partner. Not your parents and especially not your brother. As somebody who\u2019s autistic as well I find that your parents\u2019 behavior inexcusable and likely the cause of your brother\u2019s attitude. The combination of pity and the resulting behavior of no discipline and never saying no does this. My brother (also autistic) was spoiled in this way by my grandmother and as a result he lies, cheats, steals and burns through money but it\u2019s never his fault.\n\nIt\u2019s not your job to pamper your brother or please your parents. This wedding is about you. Not them.", "NTA. Hire wedding security and make sure his name isn't on the list.", "NTA. Elope and invite those that are dearest to you. They have made it abundantly clear to not only you but your other siblings that he is always first.", "Nta", "There is a place you should visit. r/justnomil", "Go straight to the vendor and ask them to refund and take a different payment. Give the money, if it's cash, to your dad. Spean to your dad and advise him your mom is on very rocky ground regarding coming at all and get him to talk to her if she's not listening to you.", "Well your Dad is just going to have to cope with being \"unhappy with it\". Explain to him that you aren't going to allow yet another one of your special moments to be hijacked and the only way to avoid this is to remove your mother from the guest list."]}
