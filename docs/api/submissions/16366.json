My mom also had a weird expectation that she would get to invite a lot of people to my brother\u2019s wedding. When she had to whittle down her list, she got over it with minimal complaints, luckily. When I got married, she was more prepared for it. My MIL had a ton of people she wanted to invite. She told my (now) husband that she should get 25 people. Not 25 total people, but 25 people plus any \u201cextras\u201d they came with (spouses/partners, kids, etc.). My husband said absolutely not. She complained a bit that it was \u201ctradition\u201d for the parents to have more of a say in the guest list, but we were firm. I think in the past, weddings were more about what the parents wanted vs what the couple wanted. \n\nAnyway, you are NTA. It sucks that your mom is trying to guilt your brother. Good for you for trying to reason with her.", "Nta. \n\nSound like moms a bit jealous she didn\u2019t put her foot down about her own wedding\n\nAlso if he friends are going to go low to no contact over a wedding invitation to a wedding she has no ability to invite to they aren\u2019t good friends. All she need say is that she asked and her son and future spouse has decided to have a really small wedding and can\u2019t invite anymore people unfortunately.", "Agree", "She\u2019s not helping with the costs. They pay the full wedding.", "My brother knows everyone from always because they usually come to my house (they also did when he lived at home) but they are not close to him. \nMy mother is not narcissistic at all and I would never tell him that, but she is very much a people person and thinks she has to return favors because she was invited to her children's wedding.\nIt's really not that grave. She feels obligated to invite them because they invited her, but she is not trying to be the \"magnanimous giver\" or be the center of attention.", "My mother and her best friend live next door and she sees her grandchildren every day. They are close to her, but she doesn't understand that for my brother and sister-in-law they are not.", "Where we live, you don't give gifts at weddings, but rather at weddings you give whatever money you consider (usually what you think the wedding has cost per person and a little more to cover some expenses). \n\nShe is not at all proud, but since she was invited to her friends' children's weddings, she feels they should do the same.", "I couldn't have explained it better. It is exactly like this.", "Southern Europe works in a strange way. Here family engagements and weddings are a pretty big deal and not taking your parents' side about something like that can look pretty bad here. \n\nI also wanted to know how people on reddit feel about inviting people you don't want to the wedding just to please your parents.", "I think it's a generational thing too. Your family wouldn't happen to have European roots?\nI'm glad it worked out well for you guys, I hope that when I get married my mom will be more prepared.", "I wouldn't say that she is jealous, but that her parents had say.", "Yes! I think this is a weird generational thing because my mother and MIL did the same thing. I have a deep rooted fear of hurting people\u2019s feelings, so my head was nearly exploding trying to figure out the guest list. Thank god my husband has a backbone when it comes to his mother and mine backed down on her own (it helped that my brother had similar limitations for his wedding). Anyway, that generation is hung up on tradition. I thought I was going to scream if I heard my MIL say \u201cYou aren\u2019t doing X?! But it\u2019s tradition!\u201d one more time.\n\nOP, keep supporting your brother.

She wants to invite SEVEN people from her best friend alone (best friend, her 3 kids, and 3 grandkids).\n\nYour brother has said no, more than once. Instead of being understanding, she's doubling down and now getting angry about it.\n\nEveryone's parents are different, I get it, and while mine certainly aren't perfect - the first \"no\" would have been more than enough. Good luck to you and your brother, and I hope he has a beautiful wedding day.", "Your mother can throw the couple a little afternoon tea party before the wedding for her invitees if she wants. They should understand it's a small wedding, if not, they're not the sort of friends she should worry about. \n\nNTA of course", "It makes more sense, but still, as you said, its not her wedding.", "Her best friend and her three children are invited. The only ones she hasn't invited are her 3 grandchildren and another friend. \nIn southern Europe parents used to be able to invite people to their children's weddings, but she is having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that life is no longer like that. \nSorry for the confusion but English is my second language and thank you for your good wishes \u2764\ufe0f", "That\u2019s actually a pretty good idea. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "You're welcome! Hope it works. \n\nPlease update afterwards! Everybody loves an update.", "NTA\n\nYou need to warn her that weddings are already a stressful time. and that if she acts like this she could end up falling out with them for a long time into the future.", "NTA. It's not the 80's anymore. If her friends go low contact or no contact with her over this, maybe they're not her friends. This is clearly meant to be a small wedding, it's not your mother's place to dictate the guest list.", "NTA. This is a weird generational thing. My mom was asking me to invite people to my wedding because they bought me Christmas presents a few times when I was a kid......like what? I couldn't pick them out of a lineup but they're supposed to be at my wedding?", "NTA\n\n\nIt's not her wedding just like you said. She needs to grow up and stop acting so entitled and selfish. It doesn't matter what her parents did at her wedding. It matters that this is their day and their memories to form and buie together and it doesn't need to be soiled by her making it about her.", "NTA\n\nI'm guessing your grandparents also paid for your mother's wedding.", "If your mom's friends will go low/no contact with her because they're not invited to the wedding, they're not really her friends, are they? \n\nNTA", "NTA   I'm 64 and I figured out that times have changed as well as social mores.  It's time your mother did too.   It's not her wedding!  She has no say!   She needs to stop pushing or he may uninvite her too.   How many reddit OPs have done that here?  Dozens, hundreds...a lot.   She does not want to be among that number.", "Especially since (often) they only want to carry on half of that tradition. I.e. when my mom got married in the 80's my grandparents paid 100% for the wedding, so my grandma got to invite whoever she wanted (and admittedly did control more of the wedding planning than was fair to my mom). When I got married my wife and I paid about 50% ourselves, my MIL paid about 30%, my mom and stepdad paid about 10%, my FIL and step MIL paid about 5%, and my dad paid about 5% ... and yet my mom still thought she should get full control over the guest list, the colors, the flowers, the cake, etc.", "No, my parents paid for their wedding.", "Even more NTA!", "Then even more NTA", "Yup my Gen X parents and I had this same argument.  Like I don\u2019t care your priority was pleasing your parents.  I\u2019ve had enough therapy to break that cycle sorry Charlie.\n\nMy parents and I were talking about the guest list over the phone while they were driving somewhere and I was on Bluetooth.  \n\nMy father pulled \u201cI don\u2019t like your tone\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 30 I don\u2019t care\u201d\n\nMy mother \u201cwe\u2019ll call you later\u201d and quickly hung up  before my father said something in anger.  They then sent me an extremely pared down guest list.  Great you made more cuts than I asked thank you so much.", "NTA and unless it's close family or close friends I wouldn't want to be invited to a wedding of someone I barely or don't even know", "NTA, It is not her wedding.  Personally, I would not want to go to a wedding of someone that I did not know just because I was friends with the mother.", "Nta", "I also think that back in the 80s the parents would have been more likely to pay for most of the wedding too.", "My ex-MIL wanted to be the queen bee at our wedding, acting all magnanimous and fake humble to her friends at a wedding she and FIL didn\u2019t pay a cent for. I told her if she wanted her groupies to come, I was inviting more of our friends and it wouldn\u2019t be a fancy, plated dinner but a buffet with cheaper booze and more dancing. So we invited everyone we thought we\u2019d want to hang out with, including their kids, and had a giant wedding party including 6 little ones that all ran up the aisle at once giggling. The reception was the most amazing, chaotic, (mostly) family-friendly dance party I\u2019ve ever been to. MIL hated it. I regret nothing.", "This is what happens when you teach women that their children are their greatest accomplishment, and that marriage is the greatest accomplishment as well. So of course the mother wants to show off the marriage of her child because it's, in her myopic housewife perspective, the most important event in her entire life since her own wedding", "That's what my mom and dad did with my sister!  They had a separate \"reception\" - totally fun - and my sis didn't have all those \"parish\" friends.  I got out of it entirely since I'm in a same sex couple but even 20 years ago when we were fake-married, they had a reception."]}
