What was hysterical is that I received a call from a couple asking who we were? They didn't know my married name!  I'm glad that habit is fading away", "NTA. 1) It's not the 80s, it's waaayyyyyyy less the norm for parents to get invites for their friends/business connections/whoever now 2) If it's such a small wedding and your brother's nearly 40 I doubt she's contributing in any real way. Did her parents fund her wedding? Because if so, that's why they \"got\" to invite people 3) If her parents DIDN'T fund her wedding... that's still not your brother's fault. He isn't obligated not to stand up for himself because she didn't 4) Maybe her friends all share her exact values here, but probably they won't actually care. Especially since it sounds about one step up from a courthouse wedding or elopement, people are way more understanding of not being invited to a wedding with 20 guests than one with 200", "NTA and she says it too \u201cmy parents invited whoever to my wedding, so I\u2019ll invite whoever to my kids wedding\u201d is a terribly hypocritical thing to say/do. If y\u2019all are handling the expenses yourselves then simply give her an invitation once everything\u2019s set. If she asks to invite other guests tell her it\u2019s far too late for that, you\u2019ve received your RSVPs and there\u2019s no space.", "NTA.  Your mother can throw an engagement party or a separate reception on her own dime and invite whoever the fuck she wants.\n\nMy MIL did help a little with the wedding via a very nice cash gift, but did not add anyone to the guest list.  She had a little intimate dinner party after that was totally in her control and it was lovely.", "NTA\n\nNot her wedding. \n\nNot her parents wedding. \n\nNot her decision.\n\nNot her choice.", "NTA, I don't understand your mom's point either. In my family when a couple gets too much wedding pushback they give up and elope.  This has gotten to be more the rule then the exception. Hope you mom can come to understand that everyone is lucky they are getting invited to this small ceremony because your bother and bride can still do a runaway wedding if she tries to make this to overwhelming for them.", "NTA- and if that's all it takes for them to drop your mom then I guess they weren't really friends to begin with. That's what my granny use to say.", "NTA for sure. You\u2019re right, it isn\u2019t her wedding. It\u2019s not her day. She\u2019s not even paying for it. I hope your brother and SIL have an amazing wedding day and celebrate with who THEY want!", "Yup. My mom said my grandma had more guests than she did at her own wedding. When I got engaged and my mom offered to pay, she immediately said \"but I have things I want\". As soon as she finished the sentence, I told her that if the money came with strings attached, I didn't want it and we'll have something small instead. She backed down, but every now and then she mentions wanting to invite her work friends. She won't invite them, but I have some regrets about not eloping lol", "I don't think this is an issue tied to a specific generation, just an expectation in certain families. \n\nGenX myself, my wedding was in 2017, we had a whopping 33 guests, all family and like 2 close friends... that was it. \n\nZero interference from my parents (Silent Gen) or siblings (Boomers) about who was being invited. \n\nWould have been a bit bigger, but most of my nieces and nephews lived out of state and couldn't make it, which I completely understood.", "I\u2019m trying to figure out husband daughter\u2026\n\nDo you mean high needs daughter because that\u2019s literally her issue.  Her daughter has severe social, sensory, impulse issues. Probably autistic with adhd, probably ARFID, possibly ODD.", "I've posted this previously, but my our motto leading up to the wedding:  \n\n\n**Not your f\\*ckin' wedding.**", "NTA. I\u2019m so glad my parents don\u2019t have friends", "Is she paying for the wedding?", "No", "Sorry I saw in another comment you addressed this, you\u2019re a great sister and NTA", "Thank you \ud83e\udd70"]}
