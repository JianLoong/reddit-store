Your girlfriend, on the other hand, could have controlled her response and didn't respond fairly.", "NTA. It's ridiculous that she *ever* made an issue of it, and it's truly outrageous that it bothers her even if you're in different rooms. I think it's rude for people you live with to expect you to always control your bodily functions *even if you're healthy*. But this is ableism writ large. She's showing no sympathy for your condition. If she can't get over this, you probably shouldn't be with her. I've had to drop a lot of people over the years who couldn't handle the impact of my genetic condition (mostly on the issue of unreliability because I can't control when I have a flare and might have to cancel plans).

She's knows this is a medical condition that limits your control, and surely it causes you anxiety and self consciousness- and then she literally acts out why a person in your situation would be anxious and self conscious when she should be supporting you (even if she internally has to suck some of it up).", "NTA\n\nMy dad has Crohn's Disease, I grew up seeing what the bad days look like. If this girl had a shred of empathy she would be GRATEFUL for your farts because it's better to be gassy than suffer the fatigue, nausea, and GI pain that would leave my dad bedridden. \n\nAlso, my husband laughs when I fart in his presence and vice versa. She's weak and natural selection is coming for her.", "Ehhh... this is a tough one. I personally feel like ESH.\n\nI'm a woman in your situation. I mean, c'mon, you don't feel your gut gurgling or anything? The polite thing to do would be to leave the room, or keep some air freshener nearby. I've been like this since I was 17 so I've kind of had time to combat all the uncomfortable and embarrassing parts that come with the illness- unfortunately it is a gross and embarrassing illness, but also unfortunately people will be grossed out by it or put off by the smells.\n\nSure, no one's gas smells like roses, but there's still an etiquette to follow.

Your girlfriend sucks, find a new one.", "NTA. Even without your disease, this is insane. Life is too short to not be able to fart freely in your own home.", "NTA you warned her", "NTA. Idk why people get so worked up about burps and farts. Especially if it's uncontrollable", "NTA - is she really worth the effort?", "NTA. You have Crohns and instead of her accepting that, she judges you for things you literally can\u2019t control. She came over and sat next to you after you warned her.

I know the actor Jason Sudeikis has no sense of smell.", "Sounds like she won't have to worry about it anymore", "Crohn's is terrible but that doesn't mean that the girlfriend has to be okay with the symptoms.  They're not married and if she is tired of smelling farts she has every right to leave.", "Well I dont know that they need to go that far lol. I just more meant someone thats okay with it, gassy themselves, etc.", "then she can leave but she doesn't need to be an AH about it...and i do mean like leave leave...", "Sounds like that's in the works", "Yup gf will def be leaving and its probably for the best.
