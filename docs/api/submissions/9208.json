I don't blame the GF for being grossed out, doesn't matter if she chose him or not, some people see farts as unpleasant and impolite, especially when people are eating.", "Talk about robbing the cradle. What was he? 4? Maybe 5?", "Yep, had those when I had the bag. Had a ridiculous accident at work with the bag. So embarrassing. When I opened my boss's door to tell him I was going home-and why-he burst out laughing. Then I laughed too. I always appreciated he made it nbd.", "I have 4 brothers 2 older 2 younger and they would rip one in my room and hold the door close, if one of my older brothers were driving they would put the window locks on. A few of my ex's would think it was funny to fart on me. I've never once got mad at anyone farting. Hell I have a cat who will jump on my lap just to fart in my face and jump down but to be far he lays up against my ass all night so it's probably pay back", "No. OP literally warned her before she sat down and she chose to do it anyway. That's exactly the opposite of being \"forced\"", "She shouldn't have thrown a tantrum.", "No, I won't say sorry who told you you could gatekeep a medical condition ?\n\n\"Gn gn gn I have this condition but not this symptom so it's not true. And you know how I know it ? Because I almost diiiiiied. Twice !\"\n\nPeople like you annoy me, it's not because you do certain things, that it should be the norm. I've got a nose sensitive enough so that I can tell you that *sneezes smell, even when using an handkerchief*. \n\nYeah, farts smell bad. No, it''s not his fault. No, he shouldn't be expected to run out of the house all the time for each and every fart. And no, it's not because you didn't experience something that others did that I'm \"educating you on your condition\"\n\nI'm educating you on *a* condition", "Good for you. My husband is 4 years in and still can\u2019t find much humor in his ostomy. I try to treat all the issues as nbd - whether they involve sound, smell, or cleanup. He still gets upset.  It\u2019s not my place to tell him how to feel but it seems to calm him when I\u2019m very matter-of-fact about it.", "If you understand not everyone's experience with it is the same what was even the point of that comment in the first place?\n\nIt's like saying \"I have a mild intolerance to food 'xy', how can OP get anaphylactic shock from it\"?\n\nI have Crohn's as well, sometimes I don't fart for weeks, sometimes my ass is like a windy tunnel that I can't control lol.", "Careful dude, don't share your own experiences or give anything other than a N T A rating. They'll get you lol", "Damn, you're rude. Like, unbelievably so. I didn't even say half the crap you're making up to fit your narrative.\n\nSheesh, make fun of a girl whose almost died. Great human being you are, lol.", "[deleted]", "Why are you hiding behind this \"I almost died so I'm right\" ?\n\nI'm not making fun of you because you almost died. I'm making fun of you because you have a serious illness and you don't even accept that others with the exact same illness can't sense a fart coming. Surely, someone with this condition knows you're not always in control. \n\nAnd because of your conviction, based on you and yourself, you're bullying a poor guy who just needs to fart in peace", "Sometimes, yeah. Unfortunately sometimes people even shit their pants without a hint. Your bowels can just \"give out\" suddenly, especially if you're in an active part of the illness and not in a remission.\n\nSometimes you can feel it coming (like your nose itching before you sneeze) and sometimes it's sudden - also like a sudden sneeze.", "What the hell? You are R E A C H I N G here. I asked the guy surely he feels one coming on? I'm not hiding behind anything xD I've almost died, I've had years to deal with this and desensitise myself to a lot of things, but just because I have this, I'm not gonna expect others to be comfortable with it, too. It's like I have a cousin who has severe throwing up episodes, I have emetophobia (fear of throwing up) and even though they can't help it, I'm not comfortable being in the same room as them. Throwing up happens, yet it's not something I enjoy being around.\n\nYour idea of bullying is very thin if you think what I'm saying is bullying, when you're literally admitting to making fun of me over nothing. Sure, people might not be in control when it comes to defecating themselves or crapping blood, but opening a window or keeping air freshener handy is still polite and limits the unpleasant smell.", "I wonder if you can make a full message without reminding me you almost died...\n\n\"Surely you can feel it\" -> patronizing, bullying, incredulous and hurtful, whatever you want to call it\n\n\"INFO : did you feel it coming ? \" -> neutral and non-judgemental\n\nI didn't say *everyone* has to be confortable with it. I said that the person who *chose* to be in a relationship with him could have the *decency* to not berate him for things out of his control and that affect him far more than her", "Bye bye, strange angry person.\n\nP.S, almost died :3", "Yes. Always. Stinky man", "NTA \n\nDutch oven her and then dump her, the ol' Dutch n dump", "NTA. She doesn't understand that you have a condition that you have very limited influence over.\n\nDepending on how much you care about her, it might be worth sitting down with her to discuss the subject in very plain language. But if she expects you to go outside to fart, I suspect she may struggle to overcome her discomfort.\n\nI've had some recent reminders about the frailty, messiness, smelliness, and overall complexity of the human body, and honestly, farts are SO mild compared to some of the things that she's likely to have to deal with in life. If she has kids, she's going to encounter smells and messes the likes of which she couldn't possibly imagine. If she doesn't, she's still going to get old one day, or she might get injured, and she's almost certainly going to get sick in a way that makes her digestive system sound like yours at least once in her life!\n\nOnly very specific individuals are ever going to be happy about this stuff, but you deserve someone who can accept that you have a human body that does human things, and some of them smell bad. Just like they do.", "You did nothing wrong, but it sounds like this relationship isn\u2019t compatible. Get yourself a girl who thinks farts are hilarious and you\u2019ll be a match made in heaven", "NTA\u2026 \n\nAnyone who is going to be in a loving and committed relationship with you is going to have to get used to normal bodily functions.. \n\nI (49m) have had to wipe my husbands ass a few times due to random medical issues at the time.. \n\nIf she can\u2019t manage a little gas here and there, you need to find someone else.", "NTA. My husband and sister in law both have Crohns and farting is a part of life. My husband jokes \"love me, love my farts.\" But it's true you take the good with the bad. Dump her now.", "NTA- My boyfriend of 13 years has Crohn\u2019s- I\u2019ve seen and smelt it all. If she can\u2019t handle you having a disease that you have zero control over, then she doesn\u2019t deserve you. I was with my boyfriend for 6 years before he had his first surgery and it was 6 months of hell for him with a temporary Ostomy. You don\u2019t want to wait until your in that position to see what her final straw is. Find someone who will love and support you for you!! Crohn\u2019s and all!!", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t co from what your body does. \n\nMy partner has ruined my appetite way more times than he knows. Because I don\u2019t tell him. \n\nI struggle with sounds. A lot of body sounds just\u2026 make me feel nauseous. Including my own. My boyfriend chews with his damn mouth open - I\u2019ve mentioned it to him multiple times when we aren\u2019t in the middle of a meal, be he says he doesn\u2019t notice and doesn\u2019t think he does and tries to be more aware of it. \n\nHis chewing repulses me and yes, I will stop eating a meal. \n\nI compromise for myself and try to make sure we eat with a show playing - the noise and visuals helps distract me so I can get through a meal better. Same with the sounds in a restaurant - usually loud enough to help drown it out. But I can\u2019t sit at a table and just enjoy his company because his eating makes me want to puke. \n\nHe knows it\u2019s an issue for me. He doesn\u2019t know how MUCH of an issue it is for me. \n\nBecause frankly, it\u2019s my issue. It\u2019s not his issue. Chewing with his mouth open is the ONLY part I say anything about because that\u2019s just bad manners, but really, he\u2019s just fucking loud work every single body function and they ALL make me nauseous. \n\nHer repulsion at farts is ultimately her issue. If she knows it will be a problem for her if she wants to eat, then she needs to not eat near you. That\u2019s her issue to deal with, not yours.", "That reaction alone says everything. She's getting pissed about a medical condition you can't help nor control  and you have the audacity to apologize for it. Drop her and find someone who supports you and loves you without controlling you and putting you down like this.", "NTA.  This girl sounds way too high-maintenance and drama queenish for you.", "NTA. If she\u2019s supposed to be your partner, she needs to accept all of you, in all your gassy glory. You are a whole, wonderful person, and that part of you that is Crohn\u2019s disease is just as valid and important as the rest of you. You can\u2019t separate yourself from it, and it will always be a part of you. If she can\u2019t accept you as you are, toots and all, she\u2019s not a terribly good partner. This isn\u2019t about etiquette/manners/politeness, it\u2019s a literal medical condition \u2014 and one with no cure at that. In the end, if she\u2019s so bothered by something you can\u2019t change about yourself, you\u2019re not well suited for each other. You deserve someone who will accept you, and your gassy tummy, with all the love in their heart! \n\nYou\u2019re so NTA, not even a little bit, and I hope one day you find a partner who loves EVERY LITTLE BIT OF YOU just the way that you are.", "How can you be an asshole for farting?  Ridiculous. NTA", "NTA. Farts are hilarious. I\u2019m sorry for your condition, but enjoy the farting. In fact, back up on her and let a big one go. Yeah, she might take off, but chances are that\u2019s gonna happen anyway if she has such a problem with it. Another fun one is to ask her out of the blue \u201cyou know what?\u201d When she says \u201cwhat\u201d, let it rip, with a cocked leg or pointing finger or both. They\u2019re all wise to the pull my finger trick.", "Dude, NTA. I know Redditors love to suggest leaving someone for the tiniest infractions but I truly think a long hard look at your relationship is warranted here. You have an actual medical condition. A serious one. You have symptoms of that condition you cannot control. Your partner should be understanding, helpful, and kind regarding this. You probably already suffer enough embarrassment from this and should be able to rely on your partner to ease that and be your safe space. Leave her. She won\u2019t change.", "Charming", "That's a alice of fried gold.", "i don\u2019t think he\u2019s the asshole because he can\u2019t control it, gf is def the AH. but i think it\u2019s disrespectful to pass gas next to other people (when you don\u2019t have a medical issue) i got in trouble doing that as a kid. it\u2019s respectful to go to the bathroom if you have to do that. i would definitely lose my appetite and don\u2019t like when anyone farts around me. but i\u2019m also very ocd and get grossed out easily by a lot of things.", "Then she doesn't need to sit down beside him especially after he warns her that he is gassy. \n\nIt's not reasonable at all to essentially be told \"you will hear/smell a fart while you're eating\" and to sit down anyways and be upset when it happens.", "I feel you there. Have same sort of issues. I always warn my hubby to keep his distance.", "Haha! I literally didn't understand what he was saying for a minute because who talks like that?! Even my 5 year old niece says fart.", "My housemate has had several surgeries and lost sections of his intestines, and tends to be gassy. He used to apologize every time, but I told him he really didn't need to do that. I understand that it's not something he does intentionally, and it's a normal bodily function. He agreed that he wouldn't feel the need to apologize to me if I didn't apologize to him when I happen to pass gas, and that was fine with me. I think he may still feel a little bit embarrassed about it when it happens around me, but only a little bit.\n\nOP's gf is a total AH. OP, you deserve better.", "That's why I appreciated his laughter. I was also allergic to the adhesive. It was a mess.  I appreciate you approaching his ostomy with love & patience.", "My partner had an ostomy for awhile (was able to eventually get it reversed) and he was so self-conscious and insecure about it and I did the same as you. It\u2019s definitely tough to watch someone you love deal with that, even though I was completely unbothered by his stoma and even grateful for it, because it saved his life. Solidarity!", "You are not good friends unless you are on farting terms", "Nta I'm the gassy one in the relationship and my husband says he is going to get me Beano lol and when he complains I ask him where the beano is and we laugh cause he still hasn't gotten me any beano yet.", "Record her farting during the night and play it during the day. When she bitches at you, say it was her.\n\nNTA, everyone farts, especially you, I'd just laugh it off", " Oh man NTA. My mom has crohns. Totally not your fault.. completely random/uncontrollable and it\u2019s not like you can hold it and go outside ALL THE TIME.. \nDump her man.. there are so many women out there that wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it at all. I\u2019m so sorry she\u2019s like that.", "NTA.  \nI've had issues with Crohn's flare ups in the past, and you're incredibly lucky that their farts and not sharts.  \n\"It'll be fine\" unless y'know, you let one go.
