NTA.\n\nUsually it's the husband should be in the delivery room with her wife which in this case your sister husband should be with her. And since you are sensitive to blood and you say no, it's fair that you tell her about it. It's wise to leave it to the medical professionals in the delivery room which you are correct.", "NTA, you are right you passing out causes unneeded complications. Why doesn't the husband support her during delivery?", "So, this is just my perspective.\n\nFirst, NTA. BUT, you could be in the room to support her up until it is time to push. You aren't going to see blood until that time and even then its not like she is going to be gushing blood.\n\nHonestly, if you want to support her, tell her you'd love to be in there to advocate for her during labor but you'd prefer to leave during delivery because you don't want to be a distraction.", "NAH. \n\nShe's emotional and scared, and it makes her feel comfortable to have you there but you're not an AH to not be in there either. \n\nShe won't be alone, had hubby! But I get her side too, my sister no matter what is my ride or die til the end, and she hates blood too. When I lived with her and cut the end of my thumb off, she drove me and stayed with me the entire time despite her fear and disgust of blood, she said she also wanted to pass out but the adrenaline kept her going. \n\nMaybe you could tell your sister you'll be there and is it possible to step out once it starts? Just let her know you'll gown up but if you feel light headed you'll step out of the room. Sounds like a good compromise and you can plan on stepping out the second it starts! Just don't tell her that. She could be in labor for hours, so knowing you're there for the boring 90% might make her happy.", "NTA. Your sister is terrified at the moment and wants you there to support her, you are unable to do that given the scenario. She's being an asshole right now, but give her some time to cool off and she'll most likely get over it. Don't feel guilty about it.", "I\u2019ll second one of the above comments. You can be up by her head, not even looking \u201cdown there\u201d and not have to see any blood. There really isn\u2019t going to be much or any until baby is actually coming out so you could likely avoid having to see anything. \n\nWould you feel more comfortable with something like that? And you could make sure you were in a chair, and that the medical staff know about your habit of fainting with blood so they can remove any soiled sheets/towels etc quickly. \n\nAlternatively, could you stay for support and comfort UNTIL it\u2019s time for the actual birth? There might be room for a compromise here.", "NTA Having a baby is a very emotional, terrifying and possibly traumatic affair and having support there is great, but the fact is not everyone can be the kind of support you need and being a whole ass adult about to be responsible for a tiny person's development means having to remember you aren't the center of the universe and that's okay.\n\nI mean, your sis feeling hurt is valid, her acting like this isn't.", "Nta", "NTA. I understand her wanting you there but if you pass out, the doctor and nurses helping her will need to help you. She should understand why you don't want to be there. I think your offer to help at home is a great comprimise!", "Nta.  Why would you intentionally bring someone you know faints at the sight of blood into the delivery room?", "NTA\n\nBut,  I'll add that I was in the room for my granddaughters birth, and not once did I see blood.   I stayed up by my daughters face, with my back turned away,  looking only at my daughter.  (I didn't want to see her coming out...just not my thing!)\n\nHer (then) husband stayed down near the Dr, witnessing the birth and giving encouragement.", "You don\u2019t have to watch the baby crowning ! You can stay up her end of the bed with her. God I can\u2019t stand blood - makes me faint - but I reckon I could get through a birth for my sisters as long as I could coach breathing and focus on their faces. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you talk to her birthing coach about it ? You may not have to see any gore.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

U have a legit reason for not wanting to be in the delivery room. Ur sister should understand that and appreciate ur offer to help in other ways. Don't let her guilt trip u into doing something that will make u uncomfortable and possibly pass out.", "NTA. Could you be there for the labor and not the delivery?", "So stand at her head and hold her hand. YTA", "No one in the delivery room wants a fainter. You would be a liability. NTA", "NTA\n\nI will say that you can do a lot before your sister before the bloody part comes, depending on how long her labor is. (I had three days of labor the first time.) You can keep her company, make sure she's got ice chips, help her to the bathroom. You can go get food for her husband, or spell him so he can go eat or go to the bathroom or just take a break. The nurse should be able to tell  yo if it's getting to the bloody part.\n\nJust a thought, anyway.", "Nta I understand she is nervous and scared. She definitely may remake your offer of helping with cooking and cleaning once the baby arrives. I think it's considerate of you. Give it time you may change your mind and ask how you can move about the room.", "NAH. She's not an AH for asking, you're not an AH for saying no.\n\nHowever, if I may make a suggestion as someone who's been present for two births - go and support her, just stay at her head. Keep your back to the business end and focus on your sister.\n\nAnd keep in mind that the actual baby eruption is pretty quick. The work to get it there can take hours and there's nothing to see. She's going to be tired and scared and hurting, and that's when she'll want her sister.", "NTA. You have no reason to be there.", "NTA but my husband will pass out with blood and was in the delivery room. Just stand at her head and hold her hand and do not look down. It isn't so much as blood you see but mucus, poop and goo.", "NTA. You don\u2019t even need a reason. If you don\u2019t want to do it that should be respected.", "He will be, but she wants me there too because I\u2019m the only female family she\u2019d feel comfortable with seeing her like that.", "Her husband will also be there, but I\u2019m the only female family she feels comfortable enough with (our mum passed away years ago) so she wants me there as well.", "I was going to say something similar. It\u2019s not as bad as tv makes it out to be.", "I\u2019d second this. Our kids were both delivered by cesarian and I saw virtually zero blood as I was very focused on my wife. Focus on your sister, not what\u2019s going on down under and you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nIf it\u2019s beyond the mere sight of blood, that\u2019s a different story. That said, the baby might have a bit of blood on them when the hand it to the mother, but I hope that\u2019s not an issue since no one is actually bleeding. ?", "Her husband will be there as well.
