Nobody is owed or inherently deserves a job at a company they have never worked for. \n\nYou let them know about a pre-existing relationship with a person and they inquired further.

You are valued at your workplace, yeah!\n\nTim might have been very uncomfortable working with you anyways.

You were justified in disclosing that you know him.", "YTA - if you really had no ill will then you wouldn't have said anything or left it at \"we grew up together and then grew apart as life took us in different directions\".
