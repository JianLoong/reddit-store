So naturally, i asked him to just pay for it and the problem would be resolved. I even told him to just give me 80% of the full price. And then this mf said that he didn't have enough money and he could only give me 50% so i told him to repay me back when he has saved up enough. But then, he lashed out at me saying that he shouldn't have to pay that much money for an accident. Like seriously wtf??. Anyways, I refused and then all shit got lose. He told me that I was runing our friendship for cash and that I was like that from the beginning blah blah bullshit. So I told him to let your parents talk with mine and then they can settle it on their own. He refused and after half an hour of going back and forth with \"how I am a guy who only thinks about money bullshit\", he told me that this friendship aint gonna work no more and blocked me. THEN , he sent me the money to my mom. This mf actually had enough money , idk the reason why he wouldn't send me in the first place.

Yeah, I don't think you're *the* ahole, but I do think you were both douchey. More so you than him. And this is coming from a fellow glass-wearing sporty guy.\n\nFirst, dude, accidents happen. Especially when you wear glasses while playing a sport that involves a high risk of things hitting your face. He might be the one who hit you, but it was your fault that the glassess were on your face while playing to begin with. I don't know how blind you are without them, but that's still a risk you decided to take. And I also understand money might be tight some times, but still. If your parents are the ones who will end up paying for it, neither of you should have taken the situation that much to heart.", "INFO: You a minor? If he paid the money the first time you asked, would you have pocketed the money or given it to your parent(s) for them to replace the glasses?", "INFO\nHow old are you and who actually paid for the glasses?"]}
