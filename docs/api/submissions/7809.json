They took us to a fancy Italian restaurant we've never been to before. The restaurant had a kid's menu, but not a separate menu on a coloring sheet, just a small section of the regular menu that was for children. Our kids are 12, 9 and 4. Our daughter is at the age where she likes to copy what her older brother does.\n\nMy in-laws sat at one end of the table and my wife and I at the other. The highchair for our youngest was at the end of the table between us, and our older kids sat at the middle of the table. My daughter was next to my wife and diagonal from me.\n\nMy wife showed our daughter where the kid's menu was, and I focused on picking something for our youngest and choosing my own meal. Our oldest said he would get mushroom ravioli, and our daughter, wanting to be like him, looked at the adult section of the menu as well. She asked what Alfredo was, and I said it was a cheese sauce. She said she liked cheese and would get the chicken Alfredo. My wife said no, that she wouldn't like it and to pick off the kid's menu.\n\nSince my wife had already taken point, I didn't interfere. Our daughter said it wasn't fair that her brother didn't have to order off the kid's menu. My father in law told my wife to let our daughter try it, and she said okay. When the waiter came, everyone ordered , and I got baked chicken and penne for our youngest. Our youngest really liked the bread and ate a lot of it.\n\nWhen the entrees came, our daughter didn't like the Alfredo. When she said that, my wife immediately said \"that's what you wanted, so you need to eat it.\" Since our youngest had already eaten so much bread and wasn't very hungry, I told her I would put some chicken and penne on one of the bread plates for her. My mother in law said \"we aren't in such a state that we need to make our grandkids go hungry to save on the dinner bill. Just order something else.\"\n\nMy daughter said she wanted pizza, so when the waiter came by, I asked them to take the Alfredo and if we could have the kid's pizza instead. He said yes and offered to take it off the bill, but my father in law said to leave it on. I didn't think any of this was a huge deal, but my wife does and is very angry. She said I made her look bad in front of her parents by encouraging our daughter to order something I knew she wouldn't eat and by offering her our youngest kid's food, like she was going to starve otherwise.\n\nI wasn't trying to encourage her to order the Alfredo. I just honestly answered what it is. I do know she loves cheese, so I could have been more careful with my answer. I didn't think about it. I also wasn't trying to be trashy by offering her some of the younger boy's food, but she said that was a white trash move and she was mortified I did it in front of her parents and I'm an asshole for doing so.", "created_utc": 1674175612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gikrc/aita_for_embarrassing_my_wife_in_front_of_her/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife\u2019s mentality would keep her stuck eating Dino Nuggies, and french fries her entire life. It\u2019s perfectly fine for kids to share food as well. When I was little all of my siblings enjoyed sharing food with each other. If that makes me white trash, then oh well, at least had a good relationship with my siblings when it came to food.", "INFO does your wife think wrapping up leftovers and taking them home is low class?", "NTA - as 1 of 6 kids, we were always made to share off our plates. Nothing you did was malicious or \"low class\". You were simply doing what most people would do and make sure your daughter had something to eat. Kids try things and don't like them. How else are they supposed to know? I'm not sure why your wife is so upset about this", "NTA. And it\u2019s a normal thing for people to do, put away uneaten food for leftovers and it doesn\u2019t necessarily go to the original person after that. You just skipped the fridge and reheating steps.", "NTA - If you don't encourage young kids to try new things, that's how you end up with picky teens and adults who refuse to eat anything beyond things on a kids menu.\n\nAll you did was answer your kid's question what Alfredo is.", "NTA.  one of the best things you can do for your kids is encourage them to try new things.  your wife's reaction baffles me.", "NTA and your wife needs to calm down. Your in-laws sound like very kind, patient people who were more than accommodating. I\u2019m kind of with you on encouraging the kid to try new things but making her stick with it if she doesn\u2019t like it. Since there was other food available that her brother didn\u2019t want, that sounds like a reasonable compromise to me. I wouldn\u2019t have ordered her something else, but your wife being mad about her ordering it in the first place is way over the top.", "NTA, kids are curious and your in laws didn\u2019t seem to take offence nor judge your wife. She on the other hand is making it a big deal out of nothing. What you could have done differently is not sending the dish back, instead taking it home and teach your kids to be mindful of wasting food.", "But it\u2019s a cheese sauce, just not yellow Kraft like she was probably expecting\u2026 Unless you\u2019re leaving out the part of the story where you openly mocked your wife and your in-laws joined in with sarcastic comments I\u2019m not seeing the embarrassment factor. Info: is she generally uptight around her parents? I know my in-laws cause my wife major anxiety and she generally overreacts any time anything comes up when they\u2019re around. \nHonestly her parents sound pretty chill and I doubt they thought much of it. \nI\u2019d say NTA but I\u2019m not sure how she usually deals with them so probably NAH.", "I'm going with NTA here. It's like this is what kids do. They try new things, don't like it and want something else. I don't know why your wife is embarrassed. In fact I think it was kind of dismissive of her to go \"You won't like it.\" How did she know? Was there something in it she knew the daughter didn't like. Like I hate it when adults tell children dismissive things instead of going \"Well it's an adult portion and it has this so you probably won't like it.\" I'm still trying to figure out how you were supposed to know your daughter wouldn't like alfredo. It's alfredo most people like that.  I think you need to talk to her because I think it is something else like maybe there was a dog whistle in the conversation? Or your wife doesn't have the best relationship with her parents in private?  For all we know in private they act differently around her.  But as it stands, NTA.", "OP, this reminds me of a story my parents heard from my state\u2019s former governor at a fancy dinner. They were discussing children and the Governor told about being at a fancy seafood restaurant early in his political career with his young children. His young daughter wanted lobster and although his wife said, \u201cno\u201d, the big donor footing the bill, said \u201coh yes sweetie\u201d.  Dinners arrived covered under large silver domes. When the domes were lifted to reveal lobsters, the child let out a blood curdling scream.  His wife soothed the girl as he asked if they had macaroni & cheese or maybe peanut butter & jelly?", "NTA - Your wife cares too much about what other people think. It\u2019s not that serious.", "NTA. Are you sure your wife wasn't upset about the extra cost and food waste? Some people are like that. \n\nAs an aunt when I have my nieces & nephews out to eat, I wait to order after each of them order. Simply because I'm not made of money and chances are one of them is going to order something they don't like. I get it, you're out seeing all kinds of yummy looking dishes. Seeing the picture to reading what's in it is vastly different.  If I hear one of them order something I think they aren't going to like, I order the dish that they would actually eat. So far that method has not failed me. We end up swapping plates (when they don't like what they got) and everything is fine. It gives them a chance to explore new taste without costing me extra money.", "INFO: Have you seen any evidence before this that your wife's family is intense about keeping up appearances and social class? Do your in-laws usually think that little things will make them look like they don't have money? Is your wife often worried about how you all appear to them when it comes to this kind of thing?\n\nMy initial read on this is that this is long-standing class anxiety she got drilled into her straight from her parents, and what might have looked low-key to you in the restaurant is just the repressive conflict style that often goes along with those investments - which might go over the head of someone who wasn't socialized to feel the twist of those particular knives. (If I'm right, MIL's remark when you went to give your daughter some of your youngest's food was ice-cold danger Will Robinson stuff, and FIL not letting the waiter comp the Alfredo takes it to another level - they care whether the waiter thinks they can't afford an extra plate of pasta? Lord. And your wife keeping it together at the time and then freaking in private also fits.) But if that's the case I'd have to imagine it would have come up here and there before now.", "4 is a little too young to be teaching the consequences game over ordering food. This would still be ridiculous if it were your parents, but she\u2019s embarrassed about how she looked in front of her own parents?! Very odd\u2026. Sounds like she may be pissed about other things and this was the icing on the cake. There\u2019s no way this would warrant a reaction and week long grudge.", "NTA I kept waiting for the shoe to drop - this is a case of mtns out of mole hills", "NTA, your wife is an idiot.", "Umm wow. Total NTA \u2026. There\u2019s so much else to say but I honestly don\u2019t ever know where to start", "You're NTA but your wife kind of gives me a migraine.", "I guess what I can't really wrap my head around is why she's embarrassed...? Her dad was encouraging as well, it wasn't just you! She had an inkling that your daughter wouldn't care for it, and that's okay, and you and your father-in-law were fine with her trying anyway, and that's okay too. Absolutely nobody is hurt in this situation.\n\nObviously you're at a loss as well, so I'm not sure what else to say... I hope your wife is alright (though I don't mean that to sound as grim as it does). Embarrassment is a weird and stupid and irrational emotion sometimes. Maybe let her know that there's absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about here? You'd know better than me if that'd hurt more than help, though. She's your wife, after all!\n\nOf course, NTA. Sorry this is going down in such a weird way, OP.", "NTA I think your wife\u2019s family just has some hang ups about appearances/money. I have a relative who used to make a show of being careless with money almost like it was proof she wasn\u2019t poor. So brand name only, whether it\u2019s flour or clothes, no leftovers in her house because she\u2019d just go back for a fresh order if she wanted more later. It was kind of sad to see how much appearances mattered in her head and to very little result. She would have been pissed if her kids tried to share food", "NTA\n\nI really don't know how you made your wife look bad.  She may have made herself look bad by trying to force your youngest to eat something she didn't like, which is a sure fire way to ensure a person never eats that food ever again once they become an adult.\n\nAs I'm someone who would barely eat anything as a child, I think having a child who is willing to try new things should be encouraged.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
