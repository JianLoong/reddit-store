He's disrespectful and I'm wondering what his upsides are because right now he sounds like a pure asshole and I sure a hell wouldn't want to be around him, much less married to him. He doesn't care about your feelings. I mean, rolling his eyes during an apology? He tells you you're sensitive because you don't like abuse.

It's not fair of him to dismiss it just because he thinks you shouldn't feel that way.", "NTA Jokes made about you are only funny when you think they're funny too. When you don't, it's bullying, plain and simple. Take me and my husband for example. We have very sarcastic and dark senses of humor. We made a deal very early in our relationship to NOT joke about subjects that we are sensitive about and that if we do joke about a subject, it's never a potshot at a sore spot for either of us. And if it's a 'new' subject, we take care of it as soon as possible. For instance, not that long ago, it came up. My husband made this same joke 3 times in the same day (different groups of people) and after the third time, I told him it hurt my feelings and he immediately apologized and stopped. Was the 'joke' true? Yes but it's a part of my personality that I'm not particularly proud of. And his jokes hurt. \n\nThe jokes about the food might not have been so bad, especially if you KNOW the food isn't cold, the meat wasn't too thin, etc., and they were obviously joking.

The bit about the meat not being thin enough was especially petty.", "NTA, at all!  There is a huge difference between playful teasing and what is happening here, which to me sounds like constant verbal abuse.  For one thing, I would suggest you stop making meals that are so unappreciated.  For another, your husband should not be joking about your sex life or your underwear with anyone except you.  That is a private husband and wife conversation, not a buddy conversation had in front of my wife to make her feel bad/devalued/objectified.  His friends do not have any right to know about your underwear.  This really does sound like verbal and emotional abuse, which wears down the abused and makes them feel like they are the crazy or over emotional one, when they are actually having a completely rational reaction to the hurt caused them. Your feelings are valid.  You do not need to toughen up.  You do need to stand up for yourself and your values, and probably get some counciling to help you do so.
