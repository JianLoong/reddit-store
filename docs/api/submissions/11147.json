He usually uses my answers against me at a later date which makes me cry when i come home because i have been humiliated and bullied many times and it brings back memories.  \nOther thing,when we hung out before,we both made an effort to plan where we are going and when, but now, it's only me reaching out and asking if he even wants to hang out.

I'm guessing he was treated before the way he's treating you now. It's not uncommon. As they say, hurt people, hurt people. That just means he's not as confident as he wants to appear.

Sweetheart, this man is not your friend. You\u2019re in an abusive platonic relationship. Time to leave and protect yourself.", "He may have had a crush on you all along.  He may have believed you were not attracted to him because of his weight and resented the perceived rejection. \n\nNow he is fit and feeling triumphant.  He may also want you to feel attracted to him so he can reject you, or at least have the upper hand.  \n\nYou are expecting your friendship to remain the same which you t never will be.

There is no limit to who will show you respect when you don't allow yourself to be disrespected. I didn't figure this out when I was very young but luckily in my early twenties. I work for a company where the owner talked down to almost everybody but he always watch what he said around me. My direct boss asked me one day if I knew why he didn't talk to me like he talked to everyone else. I said I didnt. His response was \"you demand respect\".  I couldn't even perceive what he meant at the time as I didn't view myself that way. 15 years later looking back at it I realize I was always willing to have a fight with the boss that ended with me getting fired.\n\nIn any situation if you have that mindset that if someone keeps talking to you that way a shitstorm is coming, the shitstorm Never Comes they just don't talk to you that way.", "He does not spark joy.\n\nGet rid of him as a friend.\n\nBe much happier.", "NTA but this guy friend is. I can\u2019t figure out what his rationale might be but it\u2019s not anything good. Ditch him, he clearly doesn\u2019t respect you.", "NTA. I'm sure it must be hard to let go of a friend, especially when you have supported and encouraged them for such a long time. However, he has changed and is not your friend anymore, friends don't treat you like this. He's bullying you and walking all over you, you don't have to let yourself be subjected to such humiliation. You're worth more than that. \n\nI hope your don't mind me giving you advice, but you need to let go of this fake friend. I've had friendships like that, where the other person just became unbearably selfish over time and somehow started looking down on me. I don't know why some people take niceness as permission to treat someone badly. I just walked away and I promise you that this feeling of relief that you have now after not meeting him will only get stronger once you drop him as a friend. If he doesn't contact you to meet up - good, that makes it easier. If he does after a while and demands to meet up, just tell him in very generic terms, oh sorry, I'm busy and can't meet. Don't try to explain too much, since he can use this to argue with you and guilt you into meeting again. I promise you, you will feel much better if you stop hanging out with him. \n\nThe way I see it, this could play out in two ways. Either he realized what a huge jerk he's become and come crawling back with a sincere apology and a changed attitude and you can see if you want to work on rebuilding your friendship. If he doesn't contact you, you can move on and start building up your self worth again. \n\nGood luck to you! Always remember that you are a nice person who supports their friends, you deserve much better than this!", "NTA He is isn't your friend. He has been bullying, harassing and verbally abusing you for quite some time. Why do you think that is okay? Do you have very low self esteem? if you hang out with very low quality people it leaves no room for good people to come into your space, especially as the crappy energy surrounding you puts them off.", "NTA - the friendship has run its course.\n\nAt some level, consciously or not, he probably resents that you wouldn\u2019t date him before \u201cthe change\u201d and is now making up for lost time by \u201cpunishing\u201d you.", "NTA. I had a guy 'friend' like this too. We were close initially, but over time he started behaving exactly like you've described. It was so draining and traumatising. Block him & move on. You don't need that abuse & negativity in your life.", "NTA. This is not a friend. He does not get to treat you so badly. Let him know you\u2019re DONE and walk away. What an arrogant prick.", "I knew this thread was familiar because you posted the same thing only 14 days ago. \n\n\n NTA", "Then you have no need for his number. Block him then delete his contact info because he\u2019s just gonna tear your self worth down the longer you\u2019re around him.", "Awh heck thank you, it's one of my favourite makeup looks I've done \ud83d\udc9c honestly you'll find better friends and he'll probably eventually realise what he lost and regret.", "INFO: Why did you feel the need to repost this? \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112bk4p/aita_for_cancelling_tonights_plans_with_a_friend/", "NTA. This guy is not and almost certainly has never been your friend. \n\nThere is some kind of power play going on. Either he was nice in the beginning because he wanted to have sex with you but thought you might turn him down due to his weight/appearance or he was nice because he had low self esteem and desperate for friends. Now he is \"attractive\" he seems to either think you are obliged to have sex with you and resents you for not immediately falling into his bed or he feels he's now \"above you\" and is enjoying bullying you.\n\nWhatever it is highly unpleasant behaviour. It's also not the behaviour of a genuinely confident person or the behaviour of a friend. Confident people don't need to make themselves feel better by making other people feel small. Real friends don't make their friends feel bad to make themselves feel better. \n\nGet him out of your life as quickly and as thoroughly as possible before he does even more damage to you.", "NTA: Walk away. Something quite similar happened to me when a friend lost weight. You can lose weight, too, by dropping this guy's ass from your life.", "You posted this exact same thing 2 weeks ago.", "Yeah, OP, text him, \"BLANK, I think our friendship has run its course. I wish you the best in life, but I no longer want to be in contact with you in any way.\" Then, I would block him on everything.\n\nThe friendship makes you miserable, so why keep it? If you need to make other friends, join some local groups, take some classes, or branch out in some way.\n\nWith friends like him, you don't need enemies.", "This is giving off some serious \u201cbald guy with a Bugatti\u201d vibes here.
