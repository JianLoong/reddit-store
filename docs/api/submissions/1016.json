It was a mutual decision, we have two kids together, maya and Cameron. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest and say I don\u2019t really like the schedule, it\u2019s a fair 50-50 schedule, but I don\u2019t like not seeing my kids all the time, ( yes before anyone comes at me I understand that that was what I was signing up for when I divorced, but that doesn\u2019t make not seeing my kids and easier)\n\nSometimes me and my ex-wife will let our kids come over on each others time, if we have something going on. \n\nI\u2019ve been dating someone for a few months, \u201cAmy\u201d me and Amy had a date last Wednesday , it was gonna be around six at a movie. \n\nAround 12 Pm kat (my ex) messaged me saying that she would be going on a date, and if I wanted to come grab the kids. \n\nI was glad because I wanted to see my kids so I said yes just give me a minute to start some things out. \n\nI then called Amy , and and asked her if we could reschedule, and I take her tomorrow on the date, and explained that I would like to see my kids. \n\nAlso know this is not a reoccurring thing, usually kat tells me a few days before hand, but it was last minute. \n\nShe got mad at me , ( especially for some reason when I said that I will be picking them up at my ex\u2019s house ) and she said that I was blowing her off to take time out of my day *for* my ex. \n\nI tried explaining that that\u2019s crazy I\u2019m not going there to have a few drinks I\u2019m picking up my **kids**  \n\nBut apparently , it was the same thing, and i was being very disrespectful to her by blowing her off to take time for my ex, and that I\u2019m disrespecting our relationship. \n\nI told her that I really don\u2019t get why she thinks that, because I\u2019m literally going to pick up my kids. \n\nThis ended in an argument, with her saying \u201cFINE\u201d and then refusing to take any of my calls, I picked up my kids, she still didn\u2019t answer me, I stopped trying, then when I stopped calling she starting texting me about how much of an ass I was and she was breaking up with me. \n\nI said ok but was I the problem here.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m right here, I was getting my kids. I haven\u2019t introduced them yet because I feel that it\u2019s way to soon, I mean I get it could be disappointing but I don\u2019t feel like it was that bad, I would\u2019ve taken her the next day. I don\u2019t feel like \u201cbeing with my ex\u201d was how it should\u2019ve been taken. But it\u2019s how she took it.\n\nEdit: one this wasn\u2019t to satisfy kat, was it beneficial to her? Yeah, but I did it because I wanted to see my kids, if my kids weren\u2019t involved I\u2019d say no, for everyone telling me to just have my kids meet, we have dates for a SHY of 3 months, no. \n\nBad timing? Yeah sure\n\nI didn\u2019t take my kids so she could go on her date, while maybe that\u2019s what it seemed, again I want to see my children, would I cancel on Amy to go drive kat to her date? No. Wether anyone feels otherwise about it that\u2019s not what happened. \n\nWether a partner will agree or not, if I get to see my kids, I\u2019m most likely going to t, I\u2019m not going to lie abt it. Well, maybe this is a bad time for a partner . Maybe that just means no partner at all. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f oh well.", "created_utc": 1667476866, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yl0u92/aita_for_canceling_on_my_girlfriend_to_be_with_my/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And while I\u2019m not going to tell you the kids shouldn\u2019t be your priority, you\u2019re going to have a hard time dating if your dates never know exactly when you\u2019re going to follow through on your existing commitments to them.", "NTA - However, suspect she probably had something special planned, maybe even bought a new outfit for it.", "I\u2019m thoroughly convinced anyone writing YTA is NOT A PARENT.

You ditched a date with your gf so your ex could go on a date.  \n\nLook, I get your children should be your priority.  But it was your ex's custody - simply she wanted to go on a date.

It\u2019s nothing to do with the kids, it\u2019s basically telling your gf that your ex\u2019s dating life comes before yours. Did you tell your ex that it was awkward as you have a date too? It was only a date. Why couldn\u2019t ex move her date to the next day? To me, this isn\u2019t about putting your kids first, it\u2019s about the daft reason for cancelling. And now you\u2019ve made gf look like a monster who doesn\u2019t want you to see your kids, rather than someone who just doesn\u2019t want you to cancel for bs reasons. If it was an emergency situation I\u2019m sure it would\u2019ve been a different story.", "NTA. I've been in that position and there is NOTHING that I value more than time with my children.

If you let the ex wife do this is nasty become the norm to her that you'll drop everything on a whim though.

Breaking up is a logical decision.", "I want to say NTA but i think i may have to go with ESH\u2026 Amy was completely in the wrong for blowing up on you like that and getting mad that you wanted to go and pick up your children considering they are literally your flesh and blood, they should come before your new girlfriend. But i also think you should have asked her if she wanted to move your alone time date to the next day and maybe offer to take her and the kids on a day out and introduce them. I understand it could be too early but you are obviously a big part in your children\u2019s life and they should have the right to meet and know about your current relationship situations as she may have been a potential step mother.", "NTA", "NTA, kudos to you for being a great father to your kids.

Or she knew she'll be going on a date earlier yet said nothing about the kids? And yeah, this situation isn't an emergency, so you have no other choice. Yeah, you're a good father but not so good of a partner. Your gf has every right to be upset because of this", "NTA and you\u2019re dodging a huge bullet. This woman is never going to understand the rational, level-headed decision of putting your children first. She will compete with them and try to lessen your relationship with them. Why people like this choose to date people with children, I will never understand. You\u2019re better off.", "NTA. Your children will always be at the top of the priority list.  If Kat is not mature enough to handle that, you are better off finding that out early, rather than further down the line when she has opportunities to damage your relationship with them. \n\nMake sure your next one is more accepting.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nThese are your children, who will always come first. You're with a woman who wants to be number one over them and is angry that you chose them over her. \r  \n\r  \nIf she really did break up with you, good, bullet dodged as that's not a woman you really want around your kids. She will resent them for taking your attention away from her and they'd be fully aware of this.

She sounds manipulative on top of everything else.", "If it was your day to see your kids then NTA.

And then on the day you cancel.\n\nI get that they are your kids but you had a prior commitment. They weren\u2019t sick. They didn\u2019t need rescuing. You did this to please your ex and yourself with no regard for your soon to be ex girlfriend. Bad pattern and precedent to set. Her needs and feelings are expendable. She has no chance of being any sort of priority.", "ESH - Amy shouldn't have taken it personally when your kids came first (because they should, part of dating someone with kids) but, it wasn't an emergency, like a car breaking down or a work disaster that she needed to handle. your ex had a date.  she should have given you more warning or rescheduled since you ALSO had a date.", "NAH. Your ex asked, you said yes, and your gf is probably gonna dump you.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to ask someone to reschedule a date for that, especially if it\u2019s not happening all the time. If Amy can\u2019t handle something like this, how is she going handle you co-parenting in the future? I\u2019d say that\u2019s a big red flag.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like the breakup needed to happen if she wants to consider herself more important than your kids after only a few months.  I honestly think your kids should be more important than any mere girlfriend and perhaps AS important as anyone you might marry in the future.\n\nI think you lucked out with the break up, honestly.", "YTA if you dont have time for a relationship because you have to be on call for your ex then dont date.", "NTA. Your kids come first, full stop. Anyone who tries to place a wedge between you and your kids would not be a good stepparent.", "NTA. Better you find out now before things get too serious. Co-parenting is a beast and it sounds like you and ex are champions at it.", "YTA because you blew off your gf. That was wrong", "ESH.", "NTA", "Look i have no qualms about you wanting to spend time with your kids. However, custody agreements and schedules are a thing for a reason. It keeps like consistent for the kids - it gives the kids, and the parents, a sense of structure. \n\nWhat i do have issues with is you dumping your date just because your ex wife has a date and didn\u2019t want to get a sitter. That is what your girlfriend saw when you rescheduled your date the day of. She saw you setting her aside so that you could allow your ex wife to go on a date. Had it been a scheduled time for you to have the kids, there wouldn\u2019t have been an issue. \n\nSo for that reason I\u2019m going with ESH. You and your ex wife need clear and consistent rules about the custody agreement.

You should cancel whenever there is an emergency, an event for your kids, or if your kids are just having a day and want to see you. \n\nBut, even people who have their kids 100% of the time make and keep plans with other adults in their life. Your ex gave up her own time with the kids to go on a date, and I'm not even judging that because dating and just adult interaction is important for parents. \n\nI am saying YTA because you seem to not understand why a woman you are dating, who already gets limited time with you- for very valid reasons- is upset that you cancelled on her so your ex could go out on a date. If you want to date and have adult relationships, you have to set some boundaries with your ex, and with yourself. If you are unwilling to keep plans when there is no emergency, just a conflict on your ex's parenting time, I don't think you are going to find a romantic partner at all. \n\nAnd I don't think Amy handled this particularly well, but I think that is because when she pointed out that you were cancelling your date with her so your ex could go out on a date, you held on to \"but this is about my kids!\" and in reality, it isn't. Amy hears loud and clear that you will accommodate your ex- and her dating life- over plans you made with her. \n\nThis is a kind YTA because you sound like an awesome dad who is trying to move on and also be super involved, and you deserve to find a partner, but stuff like this will drive even level headed partners away.", "YTA, you should not be dating without explicitly informing partners you will ditch them with mere hours of notice to hang out with your kids while your ex goes on a date or runs errands.

And don\u2019t get cute and ask about emergencies, surprise kid events or sick kids or any of the actual \u201ckids come first\u201d stuff that is typical. What you did was not cool. \n\nAnd yes, I was a single parent for several years so I actually do get missing your kids after divorce. I also get being considerate of others\u2019 time and six hours of notice for a non-emergency is just rude unless everyone is aware it\u2019s a possibility from day one.\n\nShe was fine to dump you because you two are not compatible. It\u2019s pretty crummy to watch your partner ditch your date so his ex can enjoy her date. You are thinking of the time with the kids but you should have some sensitivity to how your partner felt. I\u2019m sure she was shocked to suddenly be sitting at home while a woman you divorced gets to be out because of said ditching.

It\u2019s weird that you rescheduled your date so that she could have one. She asked you last minute, so you decided to cancel your plans with your girlfriend.

That's my stance, I won't discuss it further. **YTA**", "That\u2019s no excuse for cancelling on his gf though. He didn\u2019t cancel because his ex had an emergency (in that case he absolutely would have been NTA) but he cancelled his pre-planned date so his ex could go on one last minute. That\u2019s not fair to his gf", "He rescheduled so his ex could go on a date. Being a parent is hard but in this case, OP made the choice to be unreliable.", "He picked up his kids so his ex could go on a date. Let me repeat that: HE BLEW OFF HIS OWN DATE SO HIS EX COULD GO ON HERS. In what world is that an okay reason? The kids weren't in danger. They weren't sick. His ex didn't have an emergency and needed a sitter last minute. She could have just as well rescheduled her date to be on a day she didn't have the kids, or sought out another sitter.", "People with kids make plans and schedules like everyone else does. They do it all the time.", "In this case, he is a sitter. Being called to take care of kids while their parent is on a date is being a sitter.", "He didn\u2019t jump for his ex. He jumped for his kids. He literally sent his ex off to go be with another man! lol", "No one said he had to, he decided to do this on his own. I can see why his SO decided to move on. \n\nI dont think fathers are babysitters. He parents his kid when he has them but hes acting like an on call babysitter. People generally know when their kids will be around unless emergencies happen....", "Its the fact that hes on call, not that hes watching his own kid...\n\nGood for Amy imo", "Its not really. If he is \"on call\" any time he doesnt have custody then he needs to let his SO know that he will never be able to actually set time aside for her unless its a special occasion. \n\nPeople get fed up dating Dr.s and Lawyers for the same reason and people generally know what their signing up for in those cases", "It's not a six month celebration. The date started at 6. They've been dating about 3 months.", "That's how I see it too.", "Sorry posted a bit too rashly without addressing that part of it - edited (before I saw you comment) to add a bit more explanation.", "The girlfriend is a person too and her time is equally valuable. The man\u2019s time is not more valuable because he has kids. Canceling last minute is disrespectful and \u201cI miss my kids\u201d is not an emergency. This is why a lot of people won\u2019t date single parents. Because single parents want to keep their partners in a toybox and take them out to play with only when it is convenient. OP is 100% YTA.", "She might not have known, like he said she usually lets him know days in advance but this time it was last minute", "but to his kids, he's very reliable. that is more important than any date. sorry, just gonna agree to disagree here \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I stand by my statement. You cannot be a sitter for your own kids. This is just called parenting.", "God forbid a dad wants to spend time with his kids. Not every parent sees their kids as a chore, and even better, good on OP and his ex for being awesome co-parents\n\nAny good woman would be disappointed about the change of plans, but would also see dad being a dad as a green flag. If you aren't willing to deal with single parent life, then don't date a single parent", "Again, wouldn\u2019t consider it being on call. Would consider it being a parent. Again, pop off.", "I dunno maybe it\u2019s just me and the family I grew up in but like my parents were always \u201con call\u201d to be parents. Like I\u2019d go to school or something but they\u2019d be on call in case something happened. Seems like kind of a parent thing", "This is *one time* in 6 months that this happened, unless I missed something. If the gf can\u2019t handle one rescheduled date in half a year, maybe she\u2019s the one not ready for a relationship..", "Me three.", "If someone you\u2019re dating doesn\u2019t understand your kids come first, that person is NOT worth dating. 100% NTA", "The ex wife managed to keep her plans and made arrangements for the kids like a responsible adult. OP chose to cancel last minute anyway. I bet that Amy is worried that\u2019s going to be a theme and she\u2019s probably right. This was not an emergency and it was 100% inconsiderate on his part.", "I can\u2019t believe the YTA takes here, this is bonkers. He\u2019s a dad first, and his kids absolutely should take priority over a casual movie date with his gf.", "Nope.", "It can actually be written into divorce papers that the opposite parent gets first offer if one parent needs a sitter/daycare. Lots of parents want the extra time with their kids. While it can make dating difficult when the kids are younger, kids grow and they won\u2019t need you forever. Lots of parents would prefer to maximize that time.", "Its being on call.... for your ex... so they can date...\n\nBeing a parent is what he does once he has the kid", ">in case something happened\n\nYes, this is a parent thing.\n\n\n\"Im canceling our plans because my ex wants to go out\" in not the same.", "Its for a date night, you missed the fact that it wasnt an emergency and he said that he takes every opportunity to see his kids. If she gets another date then his SO would have to skip her own date so his ex could go out. If his ex gets a solid relationship going she can call him to babysit at anytime...", "You sound as bitter as Amy, at least this isn\u2019t a hill you\u2019ll die on alone I suppose.", "An opportunity arose to be with his kids? He could\u2019ve said no but he values time with his kids.", "He takes every opportunity to see HIS KIDS because he\u2019s a FATHER. If she can\u2019t deal with dating a father\u2026 then she shouldn\u2019t be with him. His kids should be his highest priority. Good for him.", "...why would i be alone? Projecting are we?", "And he is free to do that, just like Amy is free to value her own time. If he wants to be on call, he can be. He just cant expect everyone else to put their lives on hold for him", "Sure, but he needs to let his SO know that if his ex has so much as a date then he needs to cancel his and his SOs plans. Otherwise he needs to get used to being single or with someone that doesnt mind the hectic scheduling.\n\nMom gets the other 50% of the kids time right? Shes smart enough to go out sometimes even when she has the kids lmao", "Exactly, he shouldn't date."]}
