I had $4 I was willing to spend and choose a random machine not expecting to win much. I didn\u2019t win anything, and I wasn\u2019t surprised. My friend put in a $1 and won over $20 something. She was super excited about it and was kind of rubbing it in my face that I hadn\u2019t won anything and she had doubled her money off of a dollar bill. \n\nSome time passes and she\u2019s still playing off of a couple dollars and in the end she won over $50 something, so I decide to play a $5 on different machine and I jokingly asked if she would press the button for me since she had the \u201cmagic touch\u201d as we called it. \n\nI ended up winning over $200 and instead of being happy for me she was immediately pissed off that I had won so much, and wanted me to split the money with her since she had pressed the button even though it was my cash that was played. \n\nFor the rest of the night she kept making passive aggressive comments to me about the $200 I had won being hers after I said I wasn\u2019t going to split it. Keep in mind this was my birthday and she didn\u2019t even get me a gift. \n\nShe kept on trying to get me to split it by guilt tripping me, saying she needed the money for concert tickets. I told her I needed the money myself to pay off a speeding ticket I had gotten that was well over $100. She didn\u2019t budge and was mad at me the rest of the night. \n\nAm I the asshole for not splitting the money with her?", "created_utc": 1670918024, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkq4aj/aita_for_winning_money_at_the_casino_and_choosing/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
