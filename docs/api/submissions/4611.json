I don't believe the stakes (for lack of a better word) of the law has an influence on whether or not it can be immoral. My main point is that this subreddit exists to judge right from wrong from a societal perspective and not a legal one because they frequently do not align.\n\nAdditionally, I believe that considering legality to be the same as morality is a dangerous mindset to hold as a general rule. Our laws are not perfect, they are flawed sometimes down to the foundation.\n\nThe specific laws we're discussing exist to regulate a notoriously unscrupulous and arguably ethical industry. The law tells the casino who it is obligated to pay the money to. Anything outside of that is not covered by those laws, including any obligations from one party to the other regarding the payout.

I do not actually believe they are the same, but I also do not think this law is arguably immoral. I mean it's gaming.  In gaming the rules are the rules and it is fair to follow them.  Maybe if you are that adult who trounces your niece or nephew at chess then it's the AH, but this scenario involves adults, and a game.
