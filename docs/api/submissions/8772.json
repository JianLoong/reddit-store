Growing up, my parents, sister Ana (29F), and I lived next to my grandma Tere. I used to go over to her house every day while my parents worked and Ana was at school. I idolized her. Until I was a freshman in college, I felt like she could do no wrong, and I had the impression that everybody felt this way about her. Then I moved across the country and started dating someone of a different race. \n\nSuddenly, Tere stopped wanting to spend time with me or call me and when I would visit on holidays she would mostly ignore me. After awhile, I asked Ana if she knew what happened. She said Tere told people I was a race traitor, ashamed of my culture, and a disappointment (also slurs I won\u2019t repeat).\n\nSince then, I learned Tere bullied Ana her whole life about being overweight (she\u2019s not and never was) and she was put in therapy. My mom (Mia) said it was extra horseback riding lessons because Ana didn\u2019t want Bill or me to know. I confronted Mia about this, and she said I wouldn\u2019t understand because Tere ALSO had bullied her since they met. I guess she waits for Bill to leave the room and says nasty stuff about how ugly Mia is, how she\u2019s a bad mom, raised a (insert slur), how she stole her only true love, etc. until Bill comes back, then Tere acts nice again. \n\nBill believes Tere\u2019s a saint, and doesn\u2019t understand why Mia and Ana don\u2019t like her. Ana tried several times to talk to Bill about this but he never believes her or Ana about anything. I don\u2019t know why Mia & Ana put up with this for so long. They said it was because they loved Bill more than they disliked Tere so they put up with her abuse to appease Bill. I was furious, and said it was selfish to subject family to this kind of treatment, especially if it\u2019s from other family. Mia\u2019s advice quite literally was to wait for Tere to die. I tried to take being sick, make excuses to not go, or even simply ask not to go, but I was always forced to go see her anyways. \n\nThree years later (present), Tere is alive and worse than ever. She now is mean in front of Bill and he says she\u2019s just old and confused. I confronted him about everything that\u2019s happened and said she was abusive and he was enabling her. He called me a brat and accused me of turning against Tere, who \u201chad always loved me so much\u201d. Frustrated, I told him he loved Tere more than the rest of us and loved her too much. If he really loved us, he wouldn\u2019t force us to see her; he could go alone. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t spoken to me since, and Mia & Ana think I\u2019m a monster for not suffering in silence. I want nothing to do with Tere and don\u2019t think I did anything wrong by calling it how I see it, so I don\u2019t want to apologize. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: When I\u2019m home for holidays, visits to her house are sprung on us and when I ask not to go, even if I\u2019m calm and ask nicely, I\u2019m told no and it turns into Bill yelling about me not loving Tere. So not seeing her isn\u2019t really an option, unless people have any suggestions about how to avoid her besides not coming home at all. \n\nEdit 2: spelling mistakes.", "created_utc": 1675174567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10q055t/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_loves_his_mom_too_much/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being verbally abused is no excuse to just grin and bare the situation. I would simply wash my hands and go NC or the very least LC.", "NTA: There is no age where bullying and racism is acceptable. Your father has been told for years she's been horrible to his wife and daughter - probably every female she interacts with - and has never done anything.\n\nI'm sorry your mom and sister don't appreciate you standing up for them.

He doesn\u2019t see what you, you mom or your sister see. He\u2019s been conditioned by his mom his entire life to think this type of behavior is normal.

She showed everyone but your dad her true colors.", "This is very complicated. NTA.", "NTA, not one little bit. And please, don't feel like a monster! You have recognized and called out a lifelong cycle of abuse and silence. That takes personal strength and courage. Unfortunately,  you can't save people who don't wish to be saved. Your mother and sister are holding out for some mythical golden age of happiness when your grandmother dies without realizing that the damage has already been done and those scars are there for life now. It sounds like it's time for you to consider going LC or NC for your own well-being. You will drive yourself absolutely crazy and waste your own valuable time trying to change your family. At this point, the best thing you can do is love yourself. You deserve to live a happy life and to be loved unconditionally. You deserve to live a life of your choosing and to shape the world around you with love, respect, and courage. You deserve to be free from the weight of abuse and hatred.", "NTA. You're just calling out an abusive family system for what it is and setting down healthy boundaries for yourself. Being the only one in your family standing up and breaking the cycle of suffering in silence probably isn't going to make you very popular, but holding that boundary for yourself will ultimately be better for your mental health overall. This whole culture of maintaining the status quo with abusive family members absolutely needs to stop, but it tends to be so rooted that it's hard to stand up to, so I applaud you for doing so.", "Addressing your edit.\n\nYou are an adult. Your father has been offering your family up like human sacrifices on an altar to his mother. Now you get to choose whether you see her or not. He can't force you.

Your gma has damaged your whole family but don't be surprised if he refuses to open his eyes.", "NTA, keep her out of your life and maybe tell everyone about how awful she has treated you and your family, give her a taste of her own medicine", "You are an adult. Tell Bill no and when he starts shrieking, tell him the answer is still no and that you don't love Tere because she behaves in a horrible fashion and that is not your problem.

But here we are. \n\nThe thing is you can be mad at grandma all you want. But you can't tell your dad what to do or tell your dad how to feel. She's old. She'll die soon enough.

You are an adult and have no need to see her, so don't.", "ESH\nGrandma is in the wrong. No doubt about that. She can take her bigotry and hatred to the grave. It will get worse as she ages. \n\nYour father should know the truth but not in moments of heated emotions and anger. You can relay your story of how your grandma treated you, but you can not tell other peoples truths. He needs to hear that from them. If they choose not to, then that is on them and they will suffer in silence. \n\nOf course your father loves his mother. Were you and asshole for saying he loves her more? Eh? He is the only one that knows the truth of how he feels and the real reason he stopped talking to you.

No matter what he says or does to her, she still sings his praises, defends him and loves him more than her other children. There is nothing you can do about your fathers love for his mother. He would have to see it and experience it on his own and now she is so old that no matter what she says or does he is going to write it off as old age. \n\nYou are an adult and you do not have to go to see her.
