Growing up, my parents, sister Ana (29F), and I lived next to my grandma Tere. I used to go over to her house every day while my parents worked and Ana was at school. I idolized her. Until I was a freshman in college, I felt like she could do no wrong, and I had the impression that everybody felt this way about her. Then I moved across the country and started dating someone of a different race. \n\nSuddenly, Tere stopped wanting to spend time with me or call me and when I would visit on holidays she would mostly ignore me. After awhile, I asked Ana if she knew what happened. She said Tere told people I was a race traitor, ashamed of my culture, and a disappointment (also slurs I won\u2019t repeat).\n\nSince then, I learned Tere bullied Ana her whole life about being overweight (she\u2019s not and never was) and she was put in therapy. My mom (Mia) said it was extra horseback riding lessons because Ana didn\u2019t want Bill or me to know. I confronted Mia about this, and she said I wouldn\u2019t understand because Tere ALSO had bullied her since they met. I guess she waits for Bill to leave the room and says nasty stuff about how ugly Mia is, how she\u2019s a bad mom, raised a (insert slur), how she stole her only true love, etc. until Bill comes back, then Tere acts nice again. \n\nBill believes Tere\u2019s a saint, and doesn\u2019t understand why Mia and Ana don\u2019t like her. Ana tried several times to talk to Bill about this but he never believes her or Ana about anything. I don\u2019t know why Mia & Ana put up with this for so long. They said it was because they loved Bill more than they disliked Tere so they put up with her abuse to appease Bill. I was furious, and said it was selfish to subject family to this kind of treatment, especially if it\u2019s from other family. Mia\u2019s advice quite literally was to wait for Tere to die. I tried to take being sick, make excuses to not go, or even simply ask not to go, but I was always forced to go see her anyways. \n\nThree years later (present), Tere is alive and worse than ever. She now is mean in front of Bill and he says she\u2019s just old and confused. I confronted him about everything that\u2019s happened and said she was abusive and he was enabling her. He called me a brat and accused me of turning against Tere, who \u201chad always loved me so much\u201d. Frustrated, I told him he loved Tere more than the rest of us and loved her too much. If he really loved us, he wouldn\u2019t force us to see her; he could go alone. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t spoken to me since, and Mia & Ana think I\u2019m a monster for not suffering in silence. I want nothing to do with Tere and don\u2019t think I did anything wrong by calling it how I see it, so I don\u2019t want to apologize. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: When I\u2019m home for holidays, visits to her house are sprung on us and when I ask not to go, even if I\u2019m calm and ask nicely, I\u2019m told no and it turns into Bill yelling about me not loving Tere.

He thinks he gets to because ultimately he starts shouting and you comply. Next time done don't comply, ignore the shouting or even leave the house with your sister. Do ANYTHING, but don't go over there.", "NTA\n\nI grew up with a grandfather who was an abusive and chauvinistic tyrant. Sadly, it's part of the culture I grew up in. While I respect the things he had to do for his kids, I have no love for him and I would not care at all if he died tomorrow. My mother was the oldest child of a large family and he used to beat her and was also verbally abusive. But she still loves him because it was part of her upbringing that you honor your parents, regardless of their behavior. It's been ingrained and programmed into her little brain and she'll never escape it. What's crazy is the rest of her siblings share a trauma bond because of his verbal abuse. It's totally sad to see that not a single one of them has escaped it. Abuse is a nasty cycle that people either choose to live in through their own coping methods or choose to escape. \n\nI'm proud of you for you for recognizing it and breaking free of it, OP.  \n\nLike my mom will never change her mind about her parents, you can't expect things to change when it comes to your dad, either. Your challenging this core belief of his is not something individuals take to kindly - especially, as in your father's case, if they're the only child, and she is the only parent he's ever known. People like him live in these paradigms that abusers build to maintain control. They, at some point, either become complicit in it or become abusers themselves. He's become complicit in it and enables it, as well. \n\nOnly thing you can do is not stay at your parents' house when you're home for the holidays. That way, you can leave and have a place to go to when they want to visit her. \n\nIn my case, I went LC from my mom and NC with her siblings for over 5 years. I'm gradually now talking to them, but on my own terms. Put some space between you and your dad. It's clear that you are much stronger than your mother and your sister and you will set an example that they could not. \n\nBest of luck to you.", "You're 24 years old, how are you still being told what to do.  Grow a spine and don't go.  Not that difficult.  Maybe next time yell back at your dad that you don't love Tere anymore for the way she acts.

You're a grown adult and don't have to go visit her. So what if someone yells at you about it? Just don't go. You are teaching them if they yell at you, you'll give in.
