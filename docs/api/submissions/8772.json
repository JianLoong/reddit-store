Growing up, my parents, sister Ana (29F), and I lived next to my grandma Tere. I used to go over to her house every day while my parents worked and Ana was at school. I idolized her. Until I was a freshman in college, I felt like she could do no wrong, and I had the impression that everybody felt this way about her. Then I moved across the country and started dating someone of a different race. \n\nSuddenly, Tere stopped wanting to spend time with me or call me and when I would visit on holidays she would mostly ignore me. After awhile, I asked Ana if she knew what happened. She said Tere told people I was a race traitor, ashamed of my culture, and a disappointment (also slurs I won\u2019t repeat).\n\nSince then, I learned Tere bullied Ana her whole life about being overweight (she\u2019s not and never was) and she was put in therapy. My mom (Mia) said it was extra horseback riding lessons because Ana didn\u2019t want Bill or me to know. I confronted Mia about this, and she said I wouldn\u2019t understand because Tere ALSO had bullied her since they met. I guess she waits for Bill to leave the room and says nasty stuff about how ugly Mia is, how she\u2019s a bad mom, raised a (insert slur), how she stole her only true love, etc. until Bill comes back, then Tere acts nice again. \n\nBill believes Tere\u2019s a saint, and doesn\u2019t understand why Mia and Ana don\u2019t like her. Ana tried several times to talk to Bill about this but he never believes her or Ana about anything. I don\u2019t know why Mia & Ana put up with this for so long. They said it was because they loved Bill more than they disliked Tere so they put up with her abuse to appease Bill. I was furious, and said it was selfish to subject family to this kind of treatment, especially if it\u2019s from other family. Mia\u2019s advice quite literally was to wait for Tere to die. I tried to take being sick, make excuses to not go, or even simply ask not to go, but I was always forced to go see her anyways. \n\nThree years later (present), Tere is alive and worse than ever. She now is mean in front of Bill and he says she\u2019s just old and confused. I confronted him about everything that\u2019s happened and said she was abusive and he was enabling her. He called me a brat and accused me of turning against Tere, who \u201chad always loved me so much\u201d. Frustrated, I told him he loved Tere more than the rest of us and loved her too much. If he really loved us, he wouldn\u2019t force us to see her; he could go alone. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t spoken to me since, and Mia & Ana think I\u2019m a monster for not suffering in silence. I want nothing to do with Tere and don\u2019t think I did anything wrong by calling it how I see it, so I don\u2019t want to apologize. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: When I\u2019m home for holidays, visits to her house are sprung on us and when I ask not to go, even if I\u2019m calm and ask nicely, I\u2019m told no and it turns into Bill yelling about me not loving Tere.

But she still loves him because it was part of her upbringing that you honor your parents, regardless of their behavior. It's been ingrained and programmed into her little brain and she'll never escape it. What's crazy is the rest of her siblings share a trauma bond because of his verbal abuse. It's totally sad to see that not a single one of them has escaped it. Abuse is a nasty cycle that people either choose to live in through their own coping methods or choose to escape. \n\nI'm proud of you for you for recognizing it and breaking free of it, OP.  \n\nLike my mom will never change her mind about her parents, you can't expect things to change when it comes to your dad, either. Your challenging this core belief of his is not something individuals take to kindly - especially, as in your father's case, if they're the only child, and she is the only parent he's ever known. People like him live in these paradigms that abusers build to maintain control. They, at some point, either become complicit in it or become abusers themselves. He's become complicit in it and enables it, as well. \n\nOnly thing you can do is not stay at your parents' house when you're home for the holidays. That way, you can leave and have a place to go to when they want to visit her. \n\nIn my case, I went LC from my mom and NC with her siblings for over 5 years. I'm gradually now talking to them, but on my own terms. Put some space between you and your dad. It's clear that you are much stronger than your mother and your sister and you will set an example that they could not. \n\nBest of luck to you.", "You're 24 years old, how are you still being told what to do.  Grow a spine and don't go.  Not that difficult.  Maybe next time yell back at your dad that you don't love Tere anymore for the way she acts.  NTA but do yourself a favor and don't put yourself in that situation anymore.", ">  I\u2019m told no and it turns into Bill yelling about me not loving Tere.\n\nI'd be like, \"if the shoe fits.\"\n\n> So not seeing her isn\u2019t really an option, unless people have any suggestions about how to avoid her besides not coming home at all.\n\nAre you not an adult?  How can he force you to go? If it's \"go or don't visit home,\" I wouldn't visit home.", "Evidence: see the comment below mine.\n\nEdit: noone engage the troll that commented on mine.

She is a racist and a bully. Stand your ground, don't let your father bully you either.

I'm sure it wouldn't take much for her to say all the usual horrible things.", ">hateful people have a habit of living way past their expiry date.\n\nBoy is that ever the truth. My bil was an emotionally and financially abusive asshole. His children begged her to leave him when they were much younger. I will never understand why she didn't.

NTA.", "I'm so sorry you are facing all this, and absolutely you are NTA.  I have an odd, possibly disturbing analogy that may help in understanding your mother and sister, if the mods allow it through.\n\nMany years ago I read an article about a tribe in Africa that was starting to become less bound by traditional practices, one of which was FGM, then termed \"female circumcision.\" The young adult men wanted their future wives to be able to experience more pleasure, to be more modern, more like what they'd seen in films.  The religious leaders of the tribe had been won over, the fathers of the eligible girls had agreed to skip the ceremony. You'd think the decision would be over, because this was a patriarchal group and the men were on board.\n\nThen the mothers -- the mothers! -- objected.  To be properly married a girl \"had to be cut, had to be clean.\"  I've never been able to forget that phrasing.  The men couldn't understand it, and the mothers couldn't explain.  But the writer explained, and I felt this, that the mothers would've had to face their own rage, and loss, and the weight of generations of injustice, if they let their daughters escape being cut.  And it was too much.  They couldn't do it and continue living there.  And they had no skills or ability to live elsewhere, the way the young men did.\n\nYour mother and sister are trapped, by convention and by this same awful task of having to face what was done to them, if they let you get out of it.  You have immense courage and empathy, and it is far too simplistic to say \"cut them off too.\"  I hope you are able to navigate a way forward that preserves all the best of the relationships, and allows you your native honesty.", "INFO: do you always call your parents by their first names?", "Throw the whole human in the compost bin.", "Who? Never heard of them.", "I guess that\u2019s your answer. Your father is deeply invested in pleasing his mother more than he cares about you or your sister or his wife, so, if you want to have a relationship with him, being around her is the price. If that\u2019s what you want to do, I think the best approach will likely be a kind of grey-rocking. Grandma says horrible things and you stare off into space, making vague non-committal noises until it\u2019s time to go.\n\nBTW, you don\u2019t put up with her to avoid \u201cchaos.\u201d You put up with her because, if you don\u2019t, your father will verbally and emotionally abuse you. That\u2019s what is actually happening.", "Or, and I\u2019m sorry in advance because it\u2019s painful, Mia is so insecure in herself that she won\u2019t leave Bill or stand up for her children. When people stay with partners who abuse them, it\u2019s not out of love, it\u2019s out of fear.", "That could be the case. The thing is, we have zero indication that Bill might be abusive to Mia. Tere sure is, but Bill doesn\u2019t seem to believe that she\u2019s doing anything at all. While continuing to expose Mia and their kids to Tere ends up being abuse at her hands, it is absolutely possible that he truly believes they\u2019re exaggerating or straight up lying.", "NTA. Stop visiting and tell your dad you will visit when his mother dies. Or take the screaming and stay home.\n\nOr, better yet, bite back at tere. She says something mean? Shame her.", "It sounds like a listing battle to get through to Bill\u2019s willful delusion. However, you may want to record this Tere asshole spouting some of her egregious insults. You can make Bill listen to it the next time you\u2019re in a frustrating argument with him.", "NTA - don't go home at all. Why would you want to?

It\u2019s not your job to fix your mother and sister.\n\nYou were the golden child your sister the scapegoat. Read up on reputable resources about it.", "NTA. Sadly your dad isnt ever gonna see things as you do. But you are right and didnt do anything wrong to speak the truth.\n\nIt sucks when in old age your abusers toxic meanness is exposed but everyone just dismisses it as \"they are old and confused\". I always told people dementia didnt make my dad a mean bastard. He always was one. He just hid it from everyone but me till dementia made him forget he wasnt supposed to scream, berate, beat and belittle everyone he saw.", "I'm old enough to be her grandmother and I second all this.  thrown\\_away\\_6732, have you had something to eat today?  Can I get you something?", "He may not be abusive but it's highly likely he's letting other stuff his mother does to them slide if he doesn't even care that's he's witnessing it at this point.", "If she's \"old and confused\" and saying these things, that means she's always thought these things but actively hid them from her son so he wouldn't hate her. She's racist, and probably sexist. Just because she treated you well, doesn't mean you have to support her when she is abusing your sister and mother.\n\nYour dad has been emotionally coddled by the women closest to him for his entire life. It's time to rip the bandaid off. At minimum he needs to recognize she's treated his wife and daughter poorly.", "NTA", "NTA. You don't love Tere because she's treated everyone in your family horribly except her son. He can refuse to believe that all he wants, but what happened to you happened to you, and Tere is also a grown-ass woman and it is entirely reasonable to expect her to lie in the beds she makes.", "You're welcome. You make your internet grandmas proud!", "We should make her cookies. Or maybe brownies.  Or both?", "NTA\n\nJesus Christ, my paternal grandmother is the same way, except she would say shit in front of my dad and he'd suddenly have selective hearing. She's called me overweight (I never was) since the age of 11 and everytime I would ask not to go to her house, my parents forced me to go anyways saying \"you know how she is, and you're her favorite!\" \n\nI thought I could handle it for my dad, too. I was taught to be the \"bigger person\" and just wait til she died, but I couldn't handle it. Idk if it's some misogyny about women suffering in silence, but it's not right.. It's unfortunate that your mom and sis are willing to suffer, but just because you don't wanna see your grandmother doesn't mean you're the bad guy. You weren't meant to please anyone, let alone someone who constantly belittled and shamed you once you were no longer performing to standard.", "This is a possibility, or maybe you setting an example will give them the strength and inspiration to make real changes. Whatever you do, do not allow this cycle of abuse to continue."]}
