Her sister often discusses what boundaries she should have since we found out we were having our son 3 years ago. \n\nThe main issue comes from the fact that my brother\u2019s (21) girlfriend, Zara, gave birth to my niece (3) around the same time our son was born so they are only a couple months apart. Zara\u2019s dad is really the only family she has and he has been family friend for quite a while and works quite often, so my mom is kind of mother figure for her. \n\nMy wife has a problem with the closeness my mom has with my niece, says it isn\u2019t fair on my son that my mom sees my niece so often. I know his girlfriend visits most days and vice versa for company and what not and i tried to tell her that it\u2019s because my brother\u2019s girlfriend doesn\u2019t really have anyone else. \n\nMy wife\u2019s sister was over yesterday and they were talking about how crazy they thought it was that my mom was in the hospital room when my niece was born. Lucy started making passive aggressive comments about both Zara and my mom, about how they probably did it in spite of my wife having strict boundaries (I should add that it was an extremely traumatic birth and my brother did not cope well). \n\nI argued that point and said that she wasn\u2019t just there for Zara, but for him too and said that she can\u2019t place boundaries that affect the closeness of my her and mom and call the outcome of said boundaries favoritism because my mom chooses to respect those boundaries. Lucy started to get angry at me defending them and said that Zara should have those same boundaries and she doesn\u2019t have them out of spite for my wife having them. The argument just kept going round and round in circles and I told her that she\u2019s projecting her own issues with her in-laws on to my family since no one in my family has made problems with my wife\u2019s boundaries and she left early literally storming out of our house shouting about how I must have a perfect family then and that I must be the one that has issues with my wife placing boundaries because I said that is the reason why Zara sees my mom more often and it\u2019s got nothing to do with spite. \n\nMy wife continued to argue with me after asking how I can defend them when they are favoring my niece over my own son but in my eyes that is not true. I bring my son to visit my mom as often as i can and I know she loves him just as much and would spend more time with him if she could. \n\nso AITA?
