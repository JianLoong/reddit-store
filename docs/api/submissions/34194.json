People need to get over this infatuation with breastfeeding being sexual.  \n\nWhile I dislike many things about my ex-wife she always had style when it came to this.  I will never forget the manager of a restaurant in Ohio coming over and telling her she needed to cover up if she was going to do that in public after a couple that were leaving complained.  She complied by putting the blanket over her own head and flopping the other one for good measure.  I fed her hot wings under the blanket.", "Your MILs problem if she has a problem with it. NTA. Also calling you selfish for not allowing some one else to feed him, kinda says alot about her, she sounds terrible", "NTA...Feeding a baby is a natural and essential activity. It sounds like your MIL has other issues and just wanted to use this to create drama.", "NTA. They came to your HOME and want to complain you didn\u2019t hide away in your own home to feed your baby? Good riddance then honestly.", "NTA\n\nIt is incredible that we are still hearing about these sorts of situations. It is perfectly natural for baby to be fed on the breast.", "So let me see if I can get the story straight. You were breastfeeding your baby in your house in front of a toddler who most likely had no clue what was going on the first place, and your mother in law got upset? Sounds like the best solution was for her to leave and mind her own damn business what legally occurs in your house", "NTA.  First, never doubt yourself for the choices you make about feeding your child.  Breastfed.  Bottle fed.  Doesn\u2019t matter.  It\u2019s your choice.  And at 2-3 *weeks*, you are definitely *not* selfish for exclusively breastfeeding, when that is something you are able to do.  Not every woman is able to.  \n\nSecond, she doesn\u2019t get to dictate the timing of when you feed your son.  He was just a few weeks old.  Babies that young feed frequently.  It\u2019s about your comfort and his needs.  It\u2019s a natural process and the mechanics of that are up to you.\n\nHer problem isn\u2019t that you fed your son in front of her and the cousin.  It\u2019s that your choice means she doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to feed him at this time.  If you had whipped out a bottle of breast milk, I guarantee she wouldn\u2019t have had a problem with your son being fed while she was there.  But it\u2019s also your choice about when/if to start using a bottle with expressed milk.  \n\nYou did nothing wrong.  If she\u2019s uncomfortable seeing her grandson being breastfed, that\u2019s a her problem.  And it\u2019s up to her to deal with her issue.", "NTA\n\nYour MIL is a bigot.\n\nBreastfeeding is normal and the best way to feed your child.\n\nBreasts are for feeding the offspring first and sexualizing that is sick.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou were breadtfeeding in your home. Everything is fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut since she did not adress it to you, simply ignore it. Not YOUR drama.\n\n  \nIf oyur husband wants to answer, have him tell her: IF she is not comfortable with you breastfeeeding, she simply can choose not to visit.", "NTA. They came to your home. Your son had to be fed. You fed him. If a 22 year old man is uncomfortable with this, then they should make sure he doesn't procreate. If MIL is offended, then that sounds like a 'her' problem. Instead of being happy about having her grandson fed, she's getting pissy about seeing the outline of a boob. Pathetic.", "NTA - why should you be expected to go hide in the bathroom to feed a newborn?? she's just mad that you aren't bottle feeding so she can partake and is lashing out. she's very clearly had a baby before so she would expect that if she's visiting a mom with a 2-3 WEEK old baby who has already voiced that she's exclusively breastfeeding that there would be a high chance the baby would be breastfeeding during  the visit. also, its 2024?? she's an old bat with issues", "I didn\u2019t even have to read this to know you were NTA, but I went ahead and read it anyway. Your MIL is an absolute asshole though, and I hope your husband told her so. Just feed your baby mama.", "NTA. This is your MIL\u2019s problem", "NTA, your MIL on the other hand is for trying to take this much of an issue for something your child, err, needs. I guess if there is something to say that's missing and it's not on you: your MIL is really backwards on top of what's just been said", "NTA and it sounds like your MIL wants to control everything you do with your son, since she tries to micromanage how you feed him. Check out r/JustNoMIL for more support.", "Ugh, I remember being banished to another room on Christmas day (this wasn't my house) to feed the baby because people couldn't deal with seeing a woman nurse the baby. I complied because it wasn't my house, but in public, in my house, I'm feeding the baby and I'm not doing it in the bathroom and I'm not covering my whole upper body up like I was under Taliban rule or something. \n\nAnd if nephew is in his early 20s and he's never seen a bare breast before (much less one used for its primary purpose), dude needs to get out more, but from what I've seen here, the nephew isn't the issue -- he's just the person MIL is projecting her hangups onto. Definitely you are NTA. Managing a latch, dealing with a sometimes fussy baby to nurse, especially a newborn who's still getting the hang of this \"being alive\" thing, everybody else can shut up when it comes to managing a newborn or even older baby.", "If hes 20s and doesnt know what boobs are for, something is wrong. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour baby, your home.\n\nHer problem.", "Nta nursing is normal and women's breasts aren't sexualized", "NTA you were in your home feeding your baby ..", "You could have informed them ahead of time that you needed to nurse your son. They could have decided to leave before you started if they weren\u2019t interested in watching you do it. People are prudes.  Even in my own house, I will go to my room or my son\u2019s room to nurse if we have company. Just because some people are ok with it (or don\u2019t say anything), doesn\u2019t mean everyone is.  You\u2019d never nurses in front of them, right? You can judge them I suppose, but no sense in purposely making them uncomfortable.", "OP its really not that deep, you were feeding you own kid in your own house. Lets not act like  a 20 - 22 year old hasn't seen a woman's chest before, whether irl or on a screen. And if he's actually 20-22 *months,* then its even less of big deal, its not like he's gonna remember that is he. Your MIL needs to get a grip, you can breastfeed in your own home all you like ffs. NTA", "NTA. Your mother-in-law is simply a prude. You were in your own home and your child was hungry. Why should you have to leave the room to nurse the baby. If they were uncomfortable then let them leave, but they have no right to complain. BTW, I am appalled that she would say you were selfish for not letting anyone else feed the baby. Let her change his diaper it\u2019s all part of the same process.", "I am so sick of people sexualizing breastfeeding. Come on people, just stop", "NTA. You are not missing anything. MiL is the one who was uncomfortable, but in a cowardly move, used her nephew as an excuse.", "had similar issues with my MIL ushering me off into a bedroom every time my LO needed feeding. One day we popped in for a quick drink on our way somewhere and some other family we didn't see often were visiting and wanted to catch up. LO starts fussing for a feed and MIL tries to send me upstairs to sit on my own so I took the opportunity and just casually said 'its ok I've got my cover I'll feed her here if nobody minds' which no-one else did and she wouldn't say anything as she knew she'd look like and A H. So I get to feed and catch up while she made excuses to leave the room.", "NTA. Fuck them, breastfeeding is perfectly normal, my wife breastfeeds our baby all the time around family and noone complains, but we don't see as a sexual thing. Those people are sick, don't invite them over again.", "NTA.", "NTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NTA a million times.  Our society has some really messed up ideas about breasts, that\u2019s for sure.  And your MIL is right in there with the worst of it if she thinks a 20 year old needs to be protected from seeing a baby breastfeeding.  We need to continue to normalize this sight!  Only wacko pervs think there is something wrong with it.  And congratulations on your new baby!", "NTA- But I do get that some people are uncomfortable with a boob being whipped out. It is what it is.    \n\nThere is no issue with you feeding your kiddo when they need to be fed. ESPECIALLY at a few weeks old. Kids just eat, shit, cry, sleep, eat, eat, repeat.   \n\nIf the kid was walking and talking and you were chasing them around with your boobs out- yeah id be like- hey that's weird AF. Mind not doing that? hah", "NTA. Although more info needed. I bf all my kids and could do it very subtly. My friends could be less subtle and whilst it didn't bother me seeing boobs out, if your mil is this prudish and also generally against the idea, it may have been too much so I feel there is a line. She may not have felt comfortable. She is still the AH for saying you were rude though. Babies need to feed when they need to feed. Also, nephew is too young to know some people have a problem with it. They'll be fine. You could paint your boobs bright yellow first and a young child will still accept this as normal. Let's hope he still sees it as normal when he is older (not the yellow boobs part....)", "I know this is an incendiary topic- it may not be that you fed him. It may be if you were uncovered when doing it. Some women are very careful to remain covered when feeding and some just pop a boob out to feed. That tends to make a lot of people uncomfortable. But I think your MIL sounds a bit on the obtuse side of things- she knows you breast feed and complains about wanting to feed the baby- why? Does she not want you to? She doesn\u2019t get that choice. You are doing the best for your baby.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I hope your husband steps in to set boundaries with her. I knew I would get down voted for my previous comment, I am just telling the truth. Some things make people uncomfortable. Especially as Americans we don\u2019t handle some things well. But you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel uncomfortable in your own home taking care of your baby.
