Some friends invited us over today and I\u2019ve been pretty cooped up so I decided to go. It was nice getting out of the house after so long. They invited us back once a week to have game night. \n\nI would love to go but there\u2019s a slight problem. My friend (we\u2019ll call her M) has a semi large beagle mix. She\u2019s had her for years and she has always been the sweetest, meekest dog. When I brought the baby over today it\u2019s like a switch flipped. She saw babe in her car seat, sniffed her and immediately growled. She started getting extremely anxious - she was growling and barking so I quickly took babe out of car seat and gave her to M and the dog just lost it. She was trying to jump up and being extremely vocal. M kept allowing dog to get near babe to sniff her but I felt uncomfortable with the way dog was acting. No matter what M did, the dog continued to act out. M tried to slowly introduce babe but every time the dog smelled her, heard her, or saw the slightest movement she got even crazier. There was a point where I had to breastfeed and M had to take a table and box me into the corner of the couch because dog wouldn\u2019t leave us alone. Dog spent the entire time (at least 30 minutes) running back and forth to each side of the table, barking and trying to get to us. \n\nM was doing her best to be in control of the situation at all times - but dog just wouldn\u2019t listen to her. While I was feeding babe, dog attempted to jump over the table so M grabbed her and pulled her back, and dog proceeded to bite her 3 times. M ended up having to put her outside, where she literally rammed the door with all her might trying to get in. M expressed to me that she\u2019s never acted like this. She was clearly concerned about the dogs behavior. \n\nEven after that, M kept trying to allow dog to slowly be introduced to babe but at this point I was uncomfortable and made it obvious. Eventually M came to the conclusion that dog had to be put upstairs for the rest of the evening. She barked and whined for HOURS until we left.\n\nI want to continue going back but after what happened I feel uncomfortable around the dog. I don\u2019t trust her with baby at all. M handled the situation okay but you can tell she still has a level of trust for her dog and is willing to keep trying to introduce the two but I\u2019m past that point. If she can bite her owner then she can certainly get excited & bite my newborn. I just worry if we get too comfortable dog might just lunge or jump one day and seriously hurt babe. \n\nI would ask them to come to my apartment but it\u2019s not big enough to host anyone and on top of that I\u2019m already stuck here as it is. I think I\u2019m going to ask her to keep dog locked upstairs while we\u2019re there. The upstairs is huge, it\u2019s a large house with multiple rooms so it\u2019s not like she\u2019d be confined to a small space. \n\nSo WIBTA if I asked her to keep the dog locked up when we come?", "created_utc": 1683169230, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137803d/wibta_if_i_asked_my_friend_to_keep_her_dog_locked/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are worried about upsetting your friend by asking her to put her dog in another room so it doesn\u2019t kill your child? You can\u2019t be that desperate for company. Join a Mommy and Me group or meet your friend at a coffee shop but never, ever take your baby back there. You should have left the second the dog became agressive, not stayed while it bit its owner 3 times trying to attack your baby. Being a new mother is difficult and lonely but there are other SAFE places to go. Even if the dog is locked up, it knows the baby\u2019s smell and will do anything it can to get out if it knows the baby is there. Please be realistic. There are too many stories of dogs attacking children and it is not always possible to stop them. Don\u2019t take the chance. Your friend should be happy to meet you elsewhere, even if you can\u2019t do it at your place.", "NTA. \nAt the end of the day, the dog is an animal and even the best of them can be untrustworthy. \nYour friend was kind of an AH to keep trying and risking the baby. The minute the dog growled it should have been locked up.", "NTA. As both a dog owner of two sweet, small dogs, and an about-to-pop pregnant woman, if EITHER of my dogs so much as bared their teeth at a 4 WEEK OLD they'd be separated immediately.  A four week old is much too fragile to take chances with, and I'd not want to keep my dog in a situation where they are clearly stressed.  I'm sorry, but your friend did not handle that interaction well, at all. The dog should never have been allowed to get to the point she was so stressed that she resorted to biting.  That is not normal for a usually sweet and mellow dog. Poor girl must've been stressed out of her mind.", "NTA but honestly as someone with a 5 month old\u2026I just wouldn\u2019t go back. That\u2019s too much stress on you, your baby, the dog, and your friend.

What you described is a serious risk to your baby and everyone else. The dog should never know the baby is in the house next time you visit. That's an extreme reaction and you're right to prevent all contact between dog and baby", "NTA- the dog tried to jump over a table and bit her 3 times! Nope. I wouldn't want that dog anywhere near my child.", "NTA!!! If your friend wants you over there and she *knows* her dog is aggressive towards you and baby, then it should simply be a given.\n\nFrankly, inviting *anyone* with babies over if you have dogs, should be a given that the dogs may need to be put away. Especially if their history and temperament around babies is not known. \n\nIf friend says no, do *NOT* go. I have read horror stories about peoples kids being hurt and killed by dogs. Even family dogs. Theres nothing in the entire world more important now than your childs safety. That dog is a no-go.", "YTA Don't take your kid back over there.

Stay firm on this. Having the dog get to know the baby isn't that important in the scheme of things. Its not worth the risk.\n\nI dont think M handled the situation well at all. I acknowledge that she put in effort and was well intentioned. But as someone whose trained many of my own dogs over the years and who takes in fosters, I dont think she approached this in the right way.\n\nIt's hard to know from your description if the dog was anxious, excited or defensive. But they were in a heightened state. M kept giving the dog attention and putting the thing that made the dog feel that way into the dogs face. That would have really escalated things. Your meant to divert the dogs attention or move it away until its calm, then continue to do that whenever it becomes heightened around the thing it is responding to.\n\nI know that when dogs aren't safe around young children, trainers will often reccomend finding a home that doesn't have young children in it  because things only go wrong once.", "NTA\n\nI think that's a reasonable request, don't overthink it.", "NTA. Your baby\u2019s safety was at risk. I\u2019ve always had dogs (well behaved & trained)  but because they were not use to being around babies I always put them outside or in another room.

Are you that overwhelmed you would endanger your baby for a little companionship?", "YTA. This situation is dangerous for everyone and obviously stressful to the dog. And you already know the dog can't just be \"put upstairs,\" that was already tried and the animal barked and whined for hours.\n\nI don't care how small your apartment is or how much you want to get away from it---it's ridiculous of you to try and press your friend into hosting you in her home under these conditions. Have her over to your house, meet at the park, or whatever.", "If M cares about her dog like it seems she does, she already has plans to put the dog away when you come over. It\u2019s better for all the humans, and also the dog won\u2019t get so stressed. YWNBTA to bring it up", "It's tough. Certainly NTA, but it's also not fair to the dog either. That dog can't help the way that it reacted to your child.\n\nI think what I'd say would depend on who holds the burden of responsibility in this situation, if that makes sense. If your friend insists that you and your baby to come around their house to hang out, then they need to be prepared to kennel or otherwise confine their dog to another part of the house for for your comfort. However, if you're the one insisting on hanging out at your friend's place because you don't want to/feel that you can't host at your place, you may need to accept that that is that dog's home and that it's not necessarily fair to isolate and stress the animal out just so that you don't have hang out at your apartment. That might sound contradictory, but it's not; it's really just pointing out that the reasonable expectation changes depending on who's asking/expecting you and your child to be in that space.", "NTA please don't take your baby back there.", "NTA\n\nthe dog bit her three times trying to get to you. That isn't good. Idk why the dog does that but perhaps she should look into it. And yeah your concerns are very valid.. Especially after the already-happened bites.", "Never go back to that house again. That dog bit it\u2019s owner 3 times. It will attack your baby. What happens is someone checks on the dog and it gets out of the opened door? It\u2019s too dangerous to be in your baby\u2019s presence even if locked up.", "NTA. That's a pretty reasonable ask.", "NTA to ask but she has every right to say no. The dog lives there. You and the baby don\u2019t.", "NTA, if you are kindly asking that your friend's misbehaving dog not be around your baby. I can understand your concern, and would probably not want anyone or thing that could harm a baby close by.\n\nBut, it is also your friend's house, and she may chose not to lock up her pet. Can you both compromise by visiting outdoors at a neutral location without the dog?", "Nta - you and your baby\u2019s safety is above all. If the dog can\u2019t handle being around a baby then they simply can\u2019t handle it. You should absolutely not let your baby be the test/intro to socializing that dog to babies.

It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to ask for your boundary to be accommodated.", "NTA you have more patience with the dog than I would've had.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA!!!!!!\nA dog can handle being shut upstairs for a few hours. A newborn cannot handle a dog bite. Enough said", "NTA", "NTA, you have to protect your baby.  Ask her (don't tell her) if she would mind putting up the dog when you are there, and remind her of what happened.  If she is a friend she will understand, if not, don't go back there with the baby.", "NAH. You're not asked her to keep her dog \"locked\" away like some kind of sinister Hansel and Gretel thing.

Handing your baby to your friend only contributed to the dogs aggression. \n\nI know you are a new mom, but holy hell, take this as a learning opportunity and don't do it again.\n\nThe dog clearly is not safe. The fact it bit its owner repeatedly when she tried to stop the dog lunging over the table at you should have been the absolute last straw. \n\nIf you take your child back to that home, that's child endangerment. \n\nDid you know that a dog of that size can not be contained if it really wants out. They can chew through doors, walls, break out of kennels, etc. \n\nDon't put your child in that situation.", "Well let's hope she's not too upset after the dog attacks and gets put down.", "NTA. I'm an experienced dog owner (and also parent to a toddler) and the way your friend handled this likely escalated the situation. The second the dog started getting upset, the dog should have been separated. Instead, your friend kept the dog in the situation with something they perceived as a threat and kept trying to get them close to the \"threat\" while they were defensive. Their choices may have made it impossible for this situation to be recovered. \n\nIf you want to be able to have baby around the dog, M needs to get something with baby's scent on it and do some serious training around being calm with the scent. Ngl I highly doubt they are capable of that kind of training given the way they handled the situation. \n\nSo your two options are to require the dog to be away (and likely whining and barking for a lot of the time) or not going. You cannot allow that dog to be in the same room as your child - for literal years from now that dog is a genuine and significant threat to your child's safety. I would not allow my child in the room with a dog who's reacting like that even if I was physically able to intervene and closely supervising.

Before my kiddo was born, someone recommended a book to me to help handle the transition. I wasn't worried, my dog is so sweet but my friend reminded me all of the nightmare stories. So I read it and did as the book recommended. Thank goodness I did. I don't think my sweet girl would take my baby in the way she has. The kid could crawl on her and cuddle her and she would just lick the babies legs and be so gentle when getting up. Now they sleep together every night, best friends for 5 years and counting.

I don\u2019t let any dog (or other animal) near my baby (who is now 10 months). It\u2019s not even only agressive animals but all animals.

A mother and father had their parents watch the baby. They made a deal that the German shepard of the grandparents wasn\u2019t allowed in the room with the baby at all.

Not only are you protecting children but you are also protecting the dog from the consequences of its possible actions.\n\nI have dealt with highly traumatized dogs before, sometimes you have to remember the steps you are taking is for their protection", "The dog bit her friend 3 times when it could not get to the baby.", "What book is that?", "Good dog Happy baby.", "YTA to both the baby and the dog, either meet somewhere else or find a compromise that doesn\u2019t endanger anyone", "YTA, but not for the reason you think. If you take your baby to M's house, with the dog locked upstairs or not, IDGAF, your baby's life is in clear danger. M is catastrophically delusional, thinking this dog should be \"INTRODUCED\" to the infant, omg. PLEASE DO NOT EVER TAKE YOUR BABY ANYWHERE NEAR THAT DOG!", "Honestly I don't think at this point it's unreasonable to ask that of her, I think given what happened she would be happy to keep the dog away from the baby, all you can do is ask really, maybe just say when the baby is a little older you could try reintroduce them then but while baby is so tiny and vulnerable you'd prefer that doggo not meet the baby right now, and just see what she says really.. as long as you're kind and polite with her I can't see it being an issue! \nYes it's doggos house, but I think NTA, given what happened while you were there, but I definitely wouldn't take baby back if your friend isn't willing to keep the dog away for a while", "Talk about your concerns. Your friend seems to want to solve the problem. I would suggest to look for a dog trainer. Put the dog on a leash, maybe even use a muzzle and meet with a dog trainer in a park / go for a walk and slowly start to solve the dog's issues. Otherwise it will always be a struggle to meet your friend.\n\nBut if you HAVE to go to your firend's house until the behaviour gets better NTA for asking to lock the dog up.", "You WOULD be the Asshole. It\u2019s M and Dog\u2019s house. If the dog freaks out, why not have M over to your place instead? Then no one and no animals get stressed out..:", "NTA. If my dog acted that way around an infant I wouldn\u2019t have infants around the dog. You wouldn\u2019t have to ask me to keep the dog away. As a mom, I wouldn\u2019t bring my baby there. Dogs slip out of rooms all the time, especially when they\u2019re determined.", "YWBTA\n\nThe dog lives there. If you don't think your baby is safe there, don't take your baby there.", "I gotta say ESH. You for staying as long as you did and fir considering going back. M for seeing how the dog was reacting and continuing to try and expose the baby to the dog. Thank God the baby wasn't hurt, but the situation could've gone sideways easily.  Don't risk exposing your child to the dog, too easy for it to end bad for both.", "There are a number of concerning things in this post: \n- you should not feel like your only two options are to stay in an apartment that you clearly find confining or to be in a dangerous situation at a friend\u2019s house.\n- this level of stress isn\u2019t good for the dog. What you\u2019re describing is a situation where a dog was agitated for hours. That trauma will be extremely hard to undo. You should have left when it became obvious that she couldn\u2019t get the dog to decompress.\n- your solution is to continue to stress the dog. It\u2019s possible if she puts the dog upstairs before you arrive that it won\u2019t be an issue, but if your baby cries, or you ring the doorbell, I would expect a reaction. \n\nSend some of the baby\u2019s unwashed clothes to your friend\u2019s house so the dog can get accustomed to the smell. Take the baby away from the car seat and have the dog go outside to smell the car seat in a neutral location where he\u2019s less territorial. When the dog can be around the clothes and the car seat without reacting, then try coming in the house with the dog on the second floor. \n\nThe dog should be rewarded for not reacting every time. As soon as he barks/growls you remove the baby 100% from his space. \n\nI\u2019m voting NAH because I think you\u2019re a new mom and she\u2019s probably never dealt with a reactive dog before but you should both do a lot more homework on dog/newborn introductions.", "NTA, but honestly I wouldn't take the chance. If the dog was trying to forcefully get through the door on the last visit? I can only imagine the dog would do anything to get at your baby. \n\nAs a dog owner, I'm shocked that she didn't have a better handle on the situation. I get that the dog is nice and whatever, but when introducing dogs to other beings... there's ways to do it so it's not sudden and so that there's positive associations made before actually having them in the same room together. \n\nNow that this dog has acted *so* aggressively? It's ruined. There is no way to trust that the dog won't harm a baby.", "YTA for even considering bringing your baby back to that house. Meet at a coffee shop, restaurant etc. but it\u2019s too dangerous to bring the baby to your friends house when the dog reacts so severely to the baby. It takes the dog getting out one time for something horrible to happen.", "NTA but I wouldn't visit house at all. Dogs can be very reactive to the unknown and your baby seems to sound and smell like prey to the dog. High-pitched cries, strange smell, mix of food and all babies poop a lot. There is no point in endangering baby and dog.\n\nDoesn't make it a bad dog. Just a confused dog but confused dog is dangerous dog. Meet outside home, at your home but don't risk your baby being hurt and dog needing to be PTS. Barriers tend to work if no real reason to break them so wouldn't put trust in them.", "YTA if you go back to her house until your kid is way bigger.  This dog has an issue with babies and it will never be a good visit.  Have you ever seen the dog with kids or toddlers?  I get you want to get out but this is not a place that is going to be good for you until your kid reaches an age the dog can deal with.", "Sorry but I do think YWBTA. Not for requesting the dog isn\u2019t near your baby, but for not recognising that\u2019s an unrealistic request. You already acknowledged that the dog was distressed and loud when shut away. So would you really enjoy the time there with a stressed out dog in the background? And I\u2019m pretty sure M wouldn\u2019t be able to relax either. Personally I\u2019d say something like \u2018it\u2019s more stress than it\u2019s worth with the dog around so how about meeting out for coffee or a walk so we can switch off a little and dog isn\u2019t unnecessarily distressed?\u2019 Your baby isn\u2019t in danger, you and friend can relax and the dog isn\u2019t on edge either. And in the interest of trying not to be TA, make it clear this is for the benefit of the dog too, that pooch doesn\u2019t need that level of triggering activity in its own home. (Owner should address it at some point though. Like imagine if they had a kid!!). \n\nIt\u2019s a super soft YWBTA though. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to ask someone to shut their pet out when visiting with a baby but in this situation you already know that\u2019s not a workable option.", "Never let this dog near your child again. Three dogs in my city killed a newborn- just ripped her apart. You and your friend were lucky", "Maybe the baby is evil. Have you tried throwing holy water on the baby?", "Ywnbta for asking but as a mom to an 8 month old id never bring my baby back. My fianc\u00e9s dads dog did something similar when babes was 3 months and my fianc\u00e9 at the time did something but after he & his dad act like the dog is just fine and a \u201cgood boy\u201d- i however make sure it stays away from my baby", "Being a first time mom is hard. But you know what, your first priority should always be your mental health and your baby. Your baby comes first before your friend\u2019s feelings. She might not be able to understand why you are feeling anxious about the dog being near to baby, she might tell you it\u2019s nothing. She might even try convince you that you are overreacting. But you are not overreacting. You\u2019ve seen how excited the dog got when you came in first with the baby. He was just warning you. The dog might not be aggressive, but you\u2019ll never know when it might be. Don\u2019t take the risk. You will be the asshole mum if you take your daughter near the dog.", "NTA but I think you can\u2019t visit your friend for awhile and frankly I\u2019m shocked you stayed that long. Something triggered the dog and that dog cannot be around a baby. If something goes wrong your baby will be hurt and the dog will be put down. It is not safe for anyone. Have your friend visit you at your place instead.", "Btw the correct tag is YWBTA in this case (you will be the asshole) for the bot to pick up she isn't the asshole now, but if she keeps up she will be", "Or myself tbh", "Exactly. OP's friend sounds completely clueless about her dog. I would never ever trust her to create a safe environment for my baby in her house.", "Most good trainers have changed their recommendation about how to safely introduce babies to dogs. Those cute videos you see of the excited puppy basically jumping into the car seat? Snuggled up to a newborn? Covering them with a blanket? Incredibly unsafe. \n\nA mama dog would not let any strange dogs even get near her puppy. It needs to be clear that that is my baby and you (the dog) dont have any business making decisions for this child. \n\nYou're doing everything right. If it's a good natured dog it can be safely co exist and be introduced once the child is older.", "Er, no, it isn't. There is no \"You will/would be the asshole\" judgement. \n\nAITA judgements are NTA, YTA, ESH and NAH. Go to the sub's FAQ and check if you don't believe me."]}
