You want to invite her on trips with you and your wife but expect her to pay her share?  I think that is rude.  As the parent, when I go out with my child, we pick up the bill or we argue over it (My child is older than your step daughter is). If I INVITE my child to anything, then I am paying because I extended the invite.\n\nGoing from college to Uni, you cut off the f tuition support.  But Uni is more expensive.  Step daughter needed to work to pay for that tuition.  I am sure she found it  challenging to keep up with studying for school and work demands.  I can see why she choose to work full time and reduce school.\n\nYou say she wouldn't move back in with you due to rules.  What were your rules?

I feel you conveniently left out pertinent information.", "YTA - so basically you wanted your daughter to have a full time job, do college and not take out loans but not contribute anything to her tuition.  How exactly did you expect that to work?", "Something feels a little off about this post. Almost like some info is missing, but it\u2019s not so obvious that I can call it out. My gut instinct leans towards YTA. \n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure why paragraph 1 and 2 were included in your post because they are irrelevant to the core AITA scenario. I\u2019m not saying they are not important to you, but their presence makes me wonder why you decided to included them. \n\nParagraph 3, 4, and 5 sound reasonable to me. \n\nThe only thing I would comment is that paying for higher education nowadays is nothing like it was a few decades ago. If she was expected to take on most of the financial burden, then it doesn\u2019t surprise me that she needed a real job with all of the time, responsibility, and effort associated with a full time job. I definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to juggle a full time job and a full course load at the same time. Her dropping courses to the minimum required to keep the benefits seems reasonable to me. \n\nLosing her job is unfortunate and I am curious why that resulted in her changing schools. If the school closer to home is more financially viable than the old school, then that sounds like she is being responsible. \n\nThe only financially unsound thing you have described her doing is not moving back in with you despite your offer. However, you hinted that it may be due to the rules that would come with it. I am really really curious what these rules are. It feels like there is a lot left unsaid regarding this. \n\nYour final paragraph pretty much just describes the common financial experience for young adults nowadays. Everything has gotten super expensive and pay across the board hasn\u2019t kept up.\n\nYou complain that she won\u2019t go out and do things with you unless you cover the bill for her, but it sounds like you are initiating most of these outings. (If she is the one initiating these outings, then I definitely understand the frustration.)\n\nBut if you and your wife want to do something with your daughter and she can\u2019t afford it, then you really only have 2 options. Either she doesn\u2019t join you in the activity, or you decide that you want her there enough that you are willing to remove the reason she said no. \n\nCircling back to your desire for her to learn responsibility and how to budget: wouldn\u2019t it be irresponsible of her to go on these outings with you if she can\u2019t afford to?", "Curious how you thought she could afford to pay for shit when she still had 2 years left of uni to finish.", "You have so many conflicting situations here that it is not possible to give a simple YTA vs NTA.", "You're intentionally excluding her because you don't want her parent to act like her parent.

You and your wife disagree about how much to support to give to your adult daughter. There is no right and wrong here. The two of you need to work it out. \n\nMy view is you want to give your kids enough support to help them succeed (so, feed them when they are babies, pay for university if you can) but not so much that they lose all motivation. Somewhere in the middle is helping them be more comfortable than their income allows. Knowing where the line is is very hard and will vary from person to person. Maybe any support beyond the bare minimum destroys their motivation, maybe it doesn't affect them at all. People think they know the answer to that, but they really don't. Plenty of successful people got lots of support from their parents, lots of failures were cut off when they turned 18. And vice versa.", "NTA.

You are not obligated to pay for a lifestyle she cannot afford.", "NTA, but you need to get on the same page with your wife first.

Nobody wants to enable their daughter into a infantile user, but it is very possible to do this.   Sometimes people don\u2019t realize they are enabling their daughter/friend/loved one into a very bad lifelong problem.  The girl is mid 20s.  She may not have a ton of money, but we all have to live within our means.  If she knows mom and dad are going to always bridge the income gap, she probably won\u2019t try to get ahead.  That\u2019s just the way people are.  However if mom does some deep dives into what makes herself an enabler, how harmful she can be to her daughter, and how to set boundaries and realistic expectations, the daughter can realize her potential.   Mom hasn\u2019t listened to her husband this far.  Husband, it\u2019s time to find a professional who is well educated in the dynamics of being an enabler.  Let the professional tell your wife how she can literally enable her daughter to her death if this gets out of hand.
