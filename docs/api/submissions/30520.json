I was involved in the decision making to some degree but at the end of the day, my wife was the one who made the final call. If she didn't agree with my call, it was her way. Which basically meant I was only allowed to agree with her. This essentially left me without any real say in how our child was raised other than what money was spent on to some degree. We both work, but I make significantly more than she does. We had separate accounts with separate bills but now have a joint account with separate \"fun money\" accounts.\r  \n\r  \nWe did so because we agreed to pay for her first two years of college as long as she maintained good grades. I'm proud to say that she far exceeded my expectations and was a great college student - way better than I was. When she moved on to university, she was expected get a job and to pay her own way. I agreed that we should still help her out with things here and there (car insurance and cell phone, groceries from time to time or gas money, things like that) but I really wanted her to start to live on her own and become more independent and budget conscience.\r  \n\r  \nShe got off track along the way and started working a \"real\" job making good money and sort of stopped going to school. I say sort of because she continued to take other courses so she could still qualify and get student loans (that my wife co-signed for against my advice). This whole time we continued to pay for car insurance and cell phone bills although she stepped up and took charge of mostly everything else including buying whatever she wanted whenever she wanted.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward and she lost that job due to downsizing and has decided to finish school back in our hometown. She moved into an apartment she can't afford but didn't want to move back in with us even though I suggested it - probably because of the rules attached with doing so.\r  \n\r  \nShe's now in her mid-20s living by herself like an adult but not wanting all of the financial responsibility that goes with it. We still pay for the car insurance and cell phone because she can't afford to. Student loan payments came past due so it fell to my wife (and me). If we go out to dinner and/or drinks, we're expected to foot the bill (again because she can't afford to). I'd like for her to take a trip with us every now and again, but I don't want to invite because we'll be expected to foot 100% of the cost because she can't afford it.

His mom and I bought him a car, I pay the insurance, we give him money for food and gas alternately, his mom buys his clothes, he buys his shoes, and we pay for all trips and outings together. He will continue school with an advanced degree in order to get his license and certification to practice with me beforeI retire. We do not expect him to work, but he will work with his grandad during the summers. He does not ask for anything from anyone. He saves every cent he gets. This works for my family. Perhaps she should move home to make things more affordable for all involved.", "NTA. I paid for my schooling. So, I know that even while it can be daunting - it can be done.

Its called life. And you're not the problem here. Your wife is. She is laying a trap for your daughter to remain a child and building in the dependence. Tell her the truth: She'll never feel empowered to run her own life if you won't let it happen. Get out of her way so she can adult competently.
