There's three of us kids (sis 27) (me 22) (bro 20), we've all been grown and out of the house for a few years.\n\nOur mom does not get along with any of us, she's an all around nasty person and anyone who knows her knows this. Including my sister. The fact that she and dad are splitting doesn't surprise anyone, but the fact our dad \"cheated\" on her definitely shocked everyone. Both my family are very religious and they take that kind of stuff extremely seriously. \n\nI don't really know the full details of my father's \"infidelity\", but to my knowledge nothing happened until after they already agreed to separate. Per usual, my mom started twisting the truth to make people side with her, but that's not what's going on with my sister. She believes my dad, but she's still upset because my father didn't wait until the divorce was finalized and doesn't want to even talk to him because he's a \"cheater\".\n\nLong story short, in our sibling/cousin group chat I straight up said she and our mom were stupid for being mad at our dad for sleeping with another person while they're divorcing. (I didn't bring it up out of nowhere, my sister and cousins were already talking about it) Not a single person backed me up except one cousin (and my brother in private). It turned into a huge fight, and we're not really talking right now... And people are telling ME to apologize.\n\nI said hell no, and I don't plan on changing my mind. I get being religious and the sanctity of marriage or whatever, but this is just too much in my opinion. They do not love each other. It's really not even any of our business as far as I'm concerned, but now half my family thinks I'm an asshole over it and it's making me feel crazy.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: I've just been reading these comments and slowly realizing how badly I handled this. I haven't yet, but I'm going to apologize to my sister. I took my upset with the situation out on her and that wasn't fair at all. Thank you for being honest with me, everyone and sorry for making you read our messy family drama.", "created_utc": 1688919372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14v2k4t/aita_for_calling_my_sister_stupid_for_her_opinion/", "score": 466, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you want sister to see things then show, explain, use evidence. If after she still believes what she believes then that\u2019s on her.", "NTA but calling someone stupid will not make them change their mind. Say you understand the perspective but that you disagree for whatever reason.", "YTA.  She is just as entitled to her feelings about the situation.  You don\u2019t have to agree with her, but calling her stupid for having a different opinion from you was inappropriate and uncalled for.", "YTA. Getting this angry about the situation doesn't indicate that you consider something to be none of your business -- it indicates that you have a decided opinion on the subject and resent those who don't share it. Your sister's views are her own, and you don't have to agree with them, but calling someone stupid for having a different opinion is neither kind nor helpful.", "Yta because your sister is allowed her feelings and opinions and you seem to want to control them.  You don't need to agree with her, and I suppose you can even debate it with her, but that seems pointless.  What you shouldn't do is dictate.", "ESH. A divorce is bad enough for everyone involved, especially after people have been together so long (even if the marriage was crummy.) The family gossiping about it in a group chat is immature, intrusive, and rude.", "YTA. You can think her opinion is stupid but she\u2019s as entitled to it as you are to yours. But all of you need to take several steps back from your parents\u2019 business.", "Nta- but like, everyone should stay out of this.", "YTA.  It's not \"stupid\" to believe it's cheating before you're legally divorced.", "NTA in general but calling them stupid wasn\u2019t a good idea. i get that u have a different opinion about this than your mom and sister, but calling them stupid for disagreeing with you is only going to start something that you don\u2019t want to be started. let your parents get through the divorce and since you all are living away from each other family drama shouldn\u2019t be taking up your life at this point.", "NTA.  Maybe you are wrong under whatever religious beliefs you and your extended family have, but under AITA's secular standards of asshole-ness, you are allowed to date when you are formally separated from your spouse.  It isn't \"cheating.\".  In fact it is kind of the point of legal separation -- i.e. to live a single life for a period of time and decide if that's really what you want before you finalize your divorce.  Maybe its rude to call someone \"stupid\" for thinking it otherwise, but it IS stupid, so NTA.", "YTA\n\nHer opinions don't really effect you. You may disagree with her and maybe her opinions are \"incorrect\" but that is the beautiful thing about opinions they don't have a right or wrong. They aren't facts, they are our own they differ. They are shaped by our individual moral code, and standards. \n\nHonestly, as a very religious person I do look down on your father, not so much for the timing of the affair, but for sleeping with someone who he isn't married to. Whither it is adultery or simple fornication, i.e. pre-martial sex,  it is all equivalent imo. Even though we as humans like to think adultery is somehow more wrong. But that is really a side issue to the YTA/NTA issue.\n\nBut what makes you YTA is the completely unnessecaily name calling. Calling someone stupid is not ok. Ignorance and stupidity are NOT equivocal. Stupidity and stubbornness are NOT equivocal. With the name calling you crossed the line from simple disagreement to AH. Even if I did side on the side, after knowing the full story of what went down, I would NOT have come to your defense as you are in the wrong here, not for your opinion as you can't really be an AH for an opinion, but for the name calling of your sister because her opinion is on a different side than you.", "NTA\u2014 you\u2019re right, this is very messy and it\u2019ll only get messier if everyone continues to discuss it.", "NTA but leave that group chat.  Y'all don't need to be discussing your parents private business when there's likely SO much more to it than you know.", "NTA but don't get more involved and I would just be there to support your dad", "NTA. This is ridiculous.  Once someone is separated and in the divorce process, accusing them of infidelity makes no sense. That being said, it is really none of anyone's business how your father conducts his private affairs.", "N T A for your opinion but YTA for calling her stupid and technically E S H for trying to get involved in someone else\u2019s relationship issues. MYOB", "NAH Obviously this is a tumultuous time for everyone involved and people have strong feelings on the subject. I think it\u2019s probably best to leave the group chat and not talk about it while everyone\u2019s feelings are raw. \n\nAnd clearly your dad was unhappy if your mom is as bad as you say she is. However I do agree that he probably should\u2019ve waited until after the divorce. But what\u2019s done is done.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
