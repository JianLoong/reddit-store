Being a mother means sometimes you have to miss out on doing fun things with your friends that don't have children.\n\nHowever, if she's going to try and weaponize your visitation with your son by denying you visitation when she doesn't get her way, you need to get a legal custody arrangement.", "NTA.

Paying child support is not parenting, it's providing financially for him, and she too is doing that.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't plan ahead and even ask what your schedule was like, just demanded \"last minute\" that you take your son for a week. When people co-parent, communication is key and she did not communicate far enough ahead of time for her vacation.\n\nIf you have a court order, she cannot legally keep him from you on your scheduled visits. If not, you need to get one.\n\nShe can go for a \"break\" on your weekend.", "NTA.  It's hard for just about to anyone to just take off for a week with such little notice, and it's unreasonable for her to think you could do it.  Part of being a parent is realizing that, especially when the kids are little, you have to sacrifice things like childfree weeklong vacations for awhile.", "NTA.  This is not a request you can spring on anyone at the last minute. Even the other parent.\n\nA critical and time consuming part of being a good parent is pre planning and schedule organization. This will be even more critical as the child grows and has their own activities.\n\nLack of planning like this is a sign of immaturity.  Which is a big factor in having a child at 18.  If your ex isn\u2019t able to understand she can\u2019t expect others to abruptly drop everything to care for her child so she can go party for a week, I worry about that child\u2019s future", "NTA and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re \u201cparenting out of convenience\u201d either (in regards to some other comments). Everyone thinks when you split up that sharing a kid 50/50 just works and that\u2019s NOT how many states will set up custody. It can be great but it also provides no stability for the kids. Having a regularly scheduled 2 days per week plus holidays (or days off of work) is an amazing schedule for the non custodial parent. And non custodial parents have to plan their lives according to the schedule that they have. OP has weekends with his kid, and he planned his life accordingly. No one can take a whole week off at the last minute, and OP shouldn\u2019t be expected to just to somehow prove that he wants to be a parent. He already is a parent. \n\nYour ex has the responsibility of the child for most of that week, and it\u2019s fine to seek alternative care so that she can have a break.

She needs to grow up too here, and realize her calling out of her part time job is quite obviously easier and not as much of a loss if they give her a hard time, versus your full time job.   Using the term deadbeat is inflammatory. Don\u2019t let her get away with it.   I see in a comment you say you work a couple hours after the daycare closes.   Maybe try to get an exception to leave early that week and count it as like one vacation day etc, something.

Depending on your state, it's illegal to deny agreed upon custody and/or visitation unless there's a mechanism for that in your custody agreement. There are states, such as MI, where that can be grounds for her to lose custody entirely. Moving forward, there are also co-parenting apps where all communication happens through the app. Then it's documented automatically. A quick Google search will get you a lot of options to pick from.\n\nFor the rest of this, she's a parent. That means her son comes first, and if she can't find child care then there are things she doesn't get to do. That's true at 20 and at 40. It's part of being a parent.\n\nIt's also part of being a parent to prioritize your ability to provide your child with food, clothing, and shelter. You can't call off for a full week from work last minute without running a very high risk of losing your job. Which means you can't pay for yourself or your CS. So taking off is not an option. Period.\n\nIt's not your job to solve her vacation problems.\n\nNTA.", "Nta. It is completely unreasonable to expect you to take a week off without any notice.

Don't minimize what she's doing.", "NTA! \"...it\u2019s simply impossible.\", so the answer is no. \"...ruined her plans...\" No, she did that by herself when she made plans for herself without considering her son first.", "NTA. She wants you to risk losing your only source of income so she can go on vacation? I\u2019d love to hear her complain when your child support drops to 0 bc you lost your job for taking a week off with no notice.", "NTA\n\nIt's a bit much to ask someone on a whim to take an entire week off work. Although I do raise a brow at your mention of a 'real job'.", "NTA....but, your 50% responsible for this child as well. Paying child support and having the child a couple of days a week is awesome, but she has this child the rest of the time. It sounds like this was a surprise trip for her if she's just now asking. You even mention that she never asks for things like this. Have there been weekends or times where you were unable to care for your child that she sacrificed her time to be with them? At 20yrs old with a 2yr old I'm sure you both have missed out on things that friends with no children do. Is there a compromise that can be worked out? Maybe family members are willing to help when ur working or rearrange daycare schedules or paid work time off for a fun extended visit with your child? There is no excuse for her to be manipulative, but it sounds like she may be frustrated watching friends have fun while she is home with the kiddo. Sometimes, sacrifices for each other will go a long way in the long run as teamwork definitely works better for the child.

BUT, can you see that she has your son unless it is convenient for you? You do not need to figure out daycare, etc.  It may surprise you, but you have the luxury of working long hours. You have the pattern  of getting your son at planned times of days off.   You are right, she does need time to herself.", "NTA, it's last minute. However, it does sound like she's doing more of the parenting work. You also wouldn't be watching your son, you would be having your son for that time. Do you not have any friends, family members, acquaintances, Etc that you could hire as a babysitter during the day while you're at work? My daughter is going to the Bahamas for spring break, her daughter's father is taking her daughter all week. She has daycare 3 days, and he is hiring a sitter to cover the other days.", "NTA If it was planned in advance or a last minute emergency, I'd have a different answer. But it's not.", "NTA. She knew when spring break was and should have made plans ahead of time / checked with your schedule", "NTA, she could've spoken to you earlier about watching your child the whole week.

Also credit hours are not real hours.
