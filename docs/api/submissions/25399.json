It sounds like he wasn't doing much around the house when he was working, which was bad, and he should be learning his lesson, but this is for their family to work out.

Three guys who grew up in a traditional, religious household with a SAHM and grandma who did absolutely *everything* for them. The three boys could do anything they wanted after school and then the one girl had to come help with the chores. And now as adults, those guys can't figure out how to do basic housecleaning. They treat loading a dishwasher like it's rocket science and their wives are constantly in a state of shocked Pikachu as basic life-skill requests of them, like starting the laundry, require their assistance to accomplish.\n\nWas wondering if that may also be the case with y'all.", "NTA and I find it funny that your mom is defending him.

Being a SAHM isn't difficult (for me at least, but tbf I have only one baby so far AND he is a very easy baby! Circumstances for everyone around different), and once you get the hang of it, the only hiccups are things that you don't expect like a child getting sick, weather, things essentially out of your control.\n\nHe needs to pick up the slack. He just doesn't want to admit he's doing a poor job at what he probably thought was easy since his wife made it look like a breeze. What you said was more or less a harsh way of saying 'shape up, or else', which I think was a reality check. He really expected his wife to get dinner ready whenever she was working full time, and he was doing nothing but caring for the children?..

It's not that hard if you just do it and get it done right when it needs to be done rather than wait and push it off. He'd feel a lot happier with himself if he just did it.\n\nI think therapy is important for any stay at home parent imo cause it can be mentally stressful dealing with a 3yo terrorist negotiation professional. Only time I can say it should be overwhelming is if you have a huge ass house and multiple hellions. That can be a challenge for sure. But there's no reason the wife should have to come home from work and feel like she has to work more.\n\nMy wife comes home and she takes a bath and decompresses before taking over for the night so I can decompress from the little one before we put him to bed.

Instead of figuring out how to get the children to school on time, he has you(?!) take them? No. He needs to wake up at least 30-45 minutes earlier so he is completely set first, then start waking his kids up 20 minutes earlier to get them dressed, fed, and ready to go. He's a parent and that's the bare minimum there. \n\n\nHe needs to learn how to cook and have dinner ready, full stop. If he can't maintain the house well, then that's one thing, but at the minimum he needs the family fed and the children cared for. My mother wasn't what anyone would consider a good cook, but some baked chicken or fish, a vegetable (steamed/baked/boiled), and a starch are perfectly nutritious. Making some lunches before going to bed is doable. \n\n\nHe needs to step up.", "NTA. \n\nEverybody has different standards. But to do absolutely nothing, to make your kid consistently late, and to leave the house filthy is not even \"standards\" it's just he's being lazy. You aren't his parents, HE is the parent, he is just using weaponized incompetence to claim he \"can't do it\". \n\nClearly somebody is always going to pick up his slack so why does he have to do things? At some point your SIL will clean the house just because it needs doing, so why bother? You're taking the kids to school, so he doesn't need to work to make that happen. She'll cook dinner if she comes home and it's not ready, he doesn't actually need to do that. \n\nThis happens to women literally everywhere. It doesn't matter if you work or not, the burden of house and child management falls on women. Men will claim they don't know how or weren't raised to be like that. Which is crap, I know plenty of men who were raised \"traditionally\" and still learned to be an equal parent and partner. He just doesn't want to and doesn't care to.", "NTA AT ALL!! Someone had to tell him and I\u2019m so happy you did\u2026 you told him the truth and he needs to grow up and do better because it\u2019s embarrassing and unacceptable What he\u2019s doing now", "Honestly good for you.

Did he live in filth before they married??? Ugh so over this!! So many good friends are stuck with this!!", "Is he being lazy or is he struggling to figure out how to manage a household? Because if this is brand new to him, it might be a week or two before he gets his feet under him. Homemaker is a job, and like most jobs, you get better at it over time by honing your skills.", "NTA, period.", "NTA, he needs to stop making excuses and get to it.", "NTA. Nothing's more pathetic than a BAD stay at home parent. Calling out family for this is practically a moral duty in my book.", "NTA. He has to at least try. There are some things he is going to struggle with, but most of house cleaning is just digging in and getting it done.  \n\nGetting the kids to school on time seems like a no brainer, but is it him or are the kids a struggle for him to get ready?  Are they cooperative or is he struggling to get them dressed, organized and ready? I think your SIL needs to investigate what is going wrong in the morning to address the cause of the situation. \n\nBottom line he needed to be yelled at for a wake up call.

He has zero excuse, especially since both children are in school, I'm confused at what he does all day.  It takes an hour to clean a house, another hour to cook and maybe an hour to grocery shop and plan a meal.  School pick up and drop off can be a couple of hours. That's 5 hours daily, and I was generous as you don't have to shop daily, that leaves 3 extra hours a day for other things. A few hours a week for laundry, another few to care for the yard.  Bedtime and homework in the evening can be shared responsibilities. I bet when his wife did these things, stayed at home, he didn't help her though. \n\nI bet he thought his wife had it easy.  She should not have to cook when she gets home from work. Maybe he should go back to work.", "As a man, it amazes me how pathetic we are at sucking it up and doing the domestic duties well. Sucks for your SIL, but this is the reality facing most women.

It\u2019s weaponized incompetence. Oh see honey I can\u2019t do it I guess you\u2019ll have to do it while I sit around doing nothing and drinking beer, gee my life is so difficult I deserve a Pat on the back. Seen men like this all the time, I am a man and I know how to do my own laundry, clean and cook. Too many men try to recreate a mommy relationship it\u2019s so gross. No you\u2019re a grown ass adult get off your ass.", "[removed]", ">my mom is now on me for what I said\n\nFound the issue. Your mother should be picking up the slack if she feels so strongly about it.

NTA.", "There may have been a more subtle way to share your insights, but bottom line you are right; the basics of cleaning up and cooking Mac and cheese shouldn't be too hard to master if you're home full-time.\n\nI do understand his struggles though, as it may seem like (or is) an impossible task to do it exactly right as his wife did, which may be very demotivating.\n\nI have actively - almost professionally - dodged ironing the kids school uniforms for 5 years now: my partner does it with care and everything comes out perfect. When my partner was sick for a longer period of time, there came the point I HAD to do it and jeez it took me a good couple tries and seriously lowered my expectations to get through that. \n\nJust saying: it's a learning curve and I would understand him being overwhelmed by having to do everything his wife did. Would he be open for some help and advice on how to get the basics done?", "Mm I kinda thing you were a bit too harsh. Sure he needs to figure it out but to tell him his wife is going to leave him? Dick move. \n\nI\u2019m not saying he should get away with it but he just lost his job 2 months ago. Let\u2019s say the first 2 weeks, he struggled with not having to go in, feeling less than, inadequate, etc. He is trying to find his new normal of being at home.

(Which is already awesome to have, but is clearly not working in this situation.) Maybe on a weekend or day that OP or wife has off, they can walk through a normal day\u2019s schedule (maybe not the full thing wife was doing as it does sound like wife was a superstar, but a day\u2019s schedule that everyone agrees would get an adequate amount done). Instead of just giving him a list, maybe demonstrate how to do some of the things but then let him do it on his own.

I'm the worst housekeeper ever and any help is appreciated...\n\nOT:  NTA obviously.  Sometimes people need a good smack to get their shit together.  A lot of people don't appreciate it in the moment, but he'll appreciate it in the long run.  Or give you the chance to say, \"I told you so.\"  Either would probably be quite satisfying for you in this situation I'm guessing.\n\nEdit:  Thank you so much to everyone who has responded!  We've already implemented a lot of this stuff, even down to getting ourselves chore charts (they have dinosaurs on) and star charts, and we've been doing weekly menus since forever.  I guess my problem is just that I'm not very good at it.  Practise will make perfect though.  I'll keep plugging away at it.\n\nI'll add some of my own tips, since so many people seem to see cooking as a chore...\n\nI love cooking, so normally it's not counted as a \"chore\" and I do most of it even though my partner is quite capable of cooking, but my partner and I both suffer from depression occasionally, so our weekly menu includes both high effort and low effort foods - eg, homemade pizza and fish and chips.  Homemade pizza is more effort, so if I'm not really up to doing it, we swap pizza to fish and chips night and do fish and chips.  We also make sure to have extra easy options in the freezer - premade chicken and fish mostly - that can be substituted in if neither of us are up to much effort.\n\nAnother suggestion I have is to compare effort cost to food costs.  For example, a pre-made salad is going to cost more than salad components, but if you regularly forego making the salad because it's too much effort, you end up wasting a lot of food and money, which makes the pre-made salad more cost-effective for you personally.  One of the ways we apply this is by getting frozen vegetables specific to ourselves - I'm a supertaster and can't stand the majority of cooked vegetables and he has IBS and can't eat most of the veggies I will eat - so we each get our own frozen veggies and sort them out ourselves.  He gets steam-in-bag microwave ones and I get peas and sweetcorn or make myself a salad.  It's more expensive on the face of it than getting fresh and pre-preparing them, but we end up wasting a lot less and eating more veggies than we would otherwise.\n\nFor cooking itself...  I suggest a production plan.  Make a list of everything that needs to be done and organise it by cooking times.  Example:  Fish and chips:  Chips have the longest cooking time, so subtract the time the fish takes to cook from that and put the chips in for that time, then prepare the fish so it's ready to go in when the timer beeps.  Then subtract the time it takes to do the veggies from the time the fish takes and set the timer for that and prepare the veggies.  When the timer beeps, put the veggies on and reset it for the finished time.  Everything comes out at the same time and almost all of your prep is done while cooking.  Even a bad production plan can halve the time you spend in the kitchen.", "Welp, who's to say then.\n\nDepending on their ISP, your SIL could check the Internet activity on the account to see if there are unusual spikes while he's at home. That would at least tell her if he's just goofing off all day.\n\nRegardless of the reason, he needs to step up. That doesn't even mean going above and beyond like your SIL, not all of us can be over-achievers. But spending some time every day tidying the house is the least he can do. If he's dealing with depression or inadequacy, then he should spend some of that time in therapy.\n\nI don't believe in the statement \"If I can do it, you can do it\" (or any variation thereof). But shit needs to get done and at the end of the day, it's his job to do so. When we fail to do our jobs, we get warnings. If we continue to fail, we get fired. It's just the way things work and he's failing to recognize that.", "Some guys I'm seeing in the current younger generation have been, coddled by parents.

As it cooks you clean, you don\u2019t need to watch the soup boiling clean the counter or something.\n\nCleaning is a rotation, you clean two rooms everyday no matter what ( always the most used room, so for me is kitchen and living room) Then rotate the rooms the rest of the week. Monday you do bathroom and then Tuesday a different room and so on. The rooms most used will pop up in your rotation more\n\nThe biggest tip she gave me was cleaning as you go. You take out a screwdriver you put back the screwdriver not leave it out. Making a game if you have young ones to help clean up, I used a big stuff dog and if it was dirty.

Or is he simply being willfully incompetent because he has forced circumstances as an excuse?\n\nNone of us is amazing at everything. That's definitely not what I'm saying. Additionally, there's a difference between knowing how to do something and being talented in an area. I suck at cooking, but I still cook every damn day.

Maybe you could suggest that she sits down with your brother and that schedule and use it as like a base to build a schedule for him. You didn\u2019t mention either way, but it seems pretty obvious to me that he hasn\u2019t even considered doing such a thing and is just winging it. I think her input will be invaluable here because let\u2019s face it- this man is not going to get up at 5:00 tomorrow morning and start doing all the stuff she would have done that day. I\u2019m thinking maybe he could build up to being close to her level. She could set up a list of priorities, but also give him \u201cpermission\u201d to take some shortcuts as long as the end result is the same. Meals will certainly be a priority, so he could not only arrange for groceries to be delivered, but he could buy those containers of veggies that are already sliced, chopped, shredded, and even cut into those spiral noodles. When you think about it, there are plenty of other options in most supermarkets that are built for convenience. Instead of washing and cutting a variety of veg, trimming and cubing a slab of meat, and putting them all on skewers, you can get ready-made kebabs that only need to be cooked. For an inexperienced cook, grains can be tricky, but they sell pouches of rice, quinoa, etc that are already cooked and just need heating in the microwave. You can \u201chomemake\u201d soups or chili from a pouch that already has the right amounts of veg and seasonings; you can go very basic and just add water, or there are ideas on the package for optional add-ins. The freezer section is full of \u201cskillet meals,\u201d where all you have to do is empty the bag into a frying pan, cover, and heat over low heat. The fresh pasta section has similar meal kits. This one brand I love even has a couple of kits that come with a big plastic container- you layer the ingredients in the container, microwave it, and then you don\u2019t even have any dirty dishes at the end! Pro tip: adding a bay leaf when heating pre-packaged food- especially canned soup- goes a long way towards making it taste more like homemade and less like processed.\n\nYes, all of these convenience items are more pricy; another good reason to get your SIL\u2019s input on this entire thing. If it was me, I\u2019d be willing to spend a little more just to guarantee that there was a meal ready to put on the table when I got home from work. Him- NOT you- getting the kids to school on time should be another priority. Once he starts getting his shit together, he can get up early enough for the kids to take the bus to school, which will save them some gas $$$. In fact, maybe your SIL can use that as a bargaining tool: \u2018if you get the kids on the bus, the gas savings will allow us to afford the convenience food items.\u2019\n\nOther possible shortcuts- maybe the bed linens could go ten days instead of one week between washing/changing. There are cheap knock-off Roombas- I even found one on Amazon for my daughter and her wife that vacuums *and* mops. Setting one of those things to at least do a different area every day *does* substantially cut down on the need to vacuum and mop as frequently. If they own a dog, they could let it out into a fenced yard frequently. If the yard isn\u2019t fenced, you can pound a stake into the ground and attach a long lead to it. Either way, the dog gets some exercise, goes potty, and doesn\u2019t need to be walked as often.\n\nMy last suggestion is one that I see lots of couples use. There is almost always that ONE chore that you really, *really* hate to do. Whatever that might be, your spouse takes it on- and you do the same for them. The reason it\u2019s so popular and works so well is that it shows both that the other is willing to take the biggest burden off of their plate. Couples who are really invested in the other\u2019s happiness do this quite willingly, and in this case I think it would also go a long way towards reinforcing the idea that household responsibilities and parenting are a *team* effort. Somehow, your brother doesn\u2019t seem to have gotten that memo.\n\nWow- this got *way* longer than I intended, so I\u2019ll end with this- please don\u2019t take your mom\u2019s feelings personally. I have to believe that they\u2019re based on being embarrassed by your brother\u2019s attitude and behavior. You mention being a parent yourself, and for too long we\u2019ve been led to believe that poor parenting is responsible for poor behavior in adults. We\u2019ve been led to believe that we can somehow shape our children\u2019s personalities, creativity, work ethic, and emotional wellbeing. There are new studies that suggest that this is not the case. However, it\u2019s been *so* ingrained into the cultural consciousness that I doubt that Mom will ever *not* feel responsible for her son\u2019s shortcomings. You seem like an extremely kind, observant, introspective, self-aware, and empathetic person (haha don\u2019t let Mom take the credit for *that!*). I feel sure that you have the grace to understand why \u201cMom is mad at you.\u201d You are simply the most convenient target, and the best deflection, for her feelings that she has failed as a mother. It is sad, but take heart in this: Mom would never take things out on you unless she was confident that you would still love her despite it. This is the sad truth of the whole human condition. We tend to hurt the very people who love us the most because we are certain that they will continue to do so.", "Ding ding ding!!!", "Oh watching is relaxing.

He needs to go on back home to that enabling mother of his. Lol. I'm sure she has a basement room ready for him.  No grown woman that is not his mother will continue to put up with this mess.", "This. He has 8 hours a day at his disposal ffs.\n\nIf he was smart he could keep on top of all the chores, cooking and taking the kids too and from school and still have at least 4 hours a day to chill out. \n\nI clean as I go and I only have to spend 15 mins a day at most keeping the house clean and tidy, with an hour once a week to do bigger tasks like vacuuming, mopping, cleaning bathrooms etc\n\nThat poor wife, imagine having kids and then realising you have a toddler for a husband on top of that.", "When I sweep the floor, I also take out the garbage so I have a place to put the floor litter. But since the garbage is going out, I also clean out the fridge and toss out anything bad. Since I did that and now have a counter full of dirty empty containers, I now have to wash them. Might as well wash the other dishes too. Since that made the counter dirty/wet, I might as well wipe it all down. Since I've cleaned out the fridge, I might as well start a grocery list. \n\nThat's what happens when I sweep the floor. I have a clean floor, empty garbage bin, clean fridge, empty sink, clean counters, clean dishes, and started on groceries.\n\nWhen I ask my husband to sweep the floor, the floor gets swept. \n\nThat's it.\n\nI think what bothers me most about this is if I complain, he gets to fall back on \"I *did* what you *asked*.\" That's why this is bullshit. If you'd participated in the household like an equal adult, you would have seen what needed done and would have just done it. Instead, you're putting me in the position of supervisor, where everything is ultimately my responsibility.", "I find this so interesting!! It\u2019s my preferred way to clean (also have ADHD). It kind of fits with the way my brain likes to hop from task to task so I am mostly ever doing small tasks that are low stakes.", "If she does it all herself she might as well do it by herself.

They genuinely think that cleaning is a worthless thing not worth investing in or learning about, as a result they end up with that sort of attitude. The excuse that men don't pay attention just lets them uphold the cognitive dissonance.", ">I have no idea why they just think they can give up once they've got a partner either.\n\nBecause they settle into gender roles.

(OTOH, I've heard more women than men say, \"But why does my son need to know that?  He's a boy.\")\n\nI know a lady whose mother suddenly died in the 00s, aged about 70.  Her father did not know how make a sandwich, pay a bill, wash a dish, etc.; he had simply never had to.  I'm going to add that she always pointed out that if anyone was to hear this and think he was a bad person, they were wrong; she said he was a kind, loving, generous, hard-working man who was a good father and treated their mother and the kids well, but he had just plain old never had to do any of those things.", "I would love to have enough space in my fridge for multiple lunch boxes but alas I do not.

Game over, son!", "NTA\nOnly possible explanation I would accept in this situation are the following: honey I think I'm depressed and I need help. The reason that I lost my job is because it seems that I have some sort of disability that makes moving a lot more difficult and slow, or a cognitive disability where they can't tell time and have trouble doing tasks. Either way if they're not trying to get help then they are the TA. \n\n\nI have limited mobility and when my kiddos were in school, I made sure to get up well before them we had the clothes out the night before. And I got something in them even if the school also fed them breakfast and I hobbled my way down to the bus stop to be with them and make sure everything was safe till they got on the bus. And in the afternoon I would hobble myself down there and make sure they were fine getting off the bus.\n\nThe key is always prepped prep everything you can the night before any lunches any clothes backpack full everything.\n\nIf your sister had tips and was able to help you couldn't she help him show him the schedule?\n\nI truly hope this is not a I can't do this because I'm a man thing but that's all it seems like to me.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother is pathetic\n\nYour SIL mastered time management.

Getting dressed is also easy. I\u2019m really struggling to see how this is difficult.\n\nI\u2019m guessing the brother is having some pretty big mental health issues right now. Feeling inadequate, failed father, failed husband, failed breadwinner. I have clinical depression and it\u2019s a nasty fucker at the best of times.

I think you may be right he just broke his marriage...", "> NTA he\u2019s an incompetent adult, father, and spouse.\n\nNot an adult, he's a boy. There are too many boys these days that never grew up. Never learned that duty to family is a hell of a lot more than just providing money. They're failures at being husbands, fathers, and men.\n\nI don't know if they were coddled, learned it from their lazy dads, or are just regressing due to a worsening economic climate.

I don't think it's so much that they haven't been taught how to do it, they haven't been taught that they have to do it. That it's their responsibility to do it. That if they don't, there will be consequences. Because they've seen time and time again when they don't do it, everything works out fine because someone else (usually a woman) steps in to pick up the slack.", "It may not even be directly from losing his job.

People literally never lose the ability to learn(barring severe mental health problems like dementia), they only lose the will and want to.", "Seriously, cleanliness isn't just one task. It's a chain of tasks that never really ends. You do this thing now so tomorrow you can do something else. And honestly, I'm not even that tidy.

I was homeless for six weeks. Worst six weeks of my life. \n\nBlame the parents for generating failed states of people. Don't blame men for accurately assessing their own limitations.

I don't talk about my depression to loved ones\u2014not especially loved ones who I don't think will get it or may dismiss it. But getting out of bed is damn near a war most mornings. Everyone thinks I'm this jocular, funny guy. My humor isn't because I'm chipper. It's because I'm trying to make it through in one piece and humor's the only thing holding me together a lot of the time. It's because I'm just inwardly miserable enough that someone else's outward misery toward me might push me over, so humoring them will reverse ensure they can't feel worse about me than I feel about myself.\n\nMental health isn't like the movies. People don't just come out in the open with their mental states. It's not obvious. They're not walking around with a frown or sad eyes. Most responses by loved ones to someone's suicide is \"I don't understand. He seemed happy and normal.\"\n\nMost aren't even self-aware enough to realize what they're really feeling.

You and your brother clearly don't even know what depression looks or feels like. \n\nPlus you sound like an asshole, so no wonder he doesn't open up to you. He's probably got no one to talk to at all in his life. He needs to be in therapy yesterday. And don't be surprised when his therapist encourages him to cut you out of his life.", "Depression was my first thought when reading some of the comments.", "Therapy is a real win win in this situation because even if the reason he's doing a shit job as sahd isn't his recent job loss there is *some* reason and he needs to face it before his life blows up completely.", "This is exactly it.
