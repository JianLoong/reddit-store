He\u2019s had years to learn from his wife and never took any interest assuming she would always be the one to do everything, and now he\u2019s hopefully finally appreciating how hard she works to keep everything in order.

Your brother is your wife's 3rd child.  He is pathetic. He is a loser. She will divorce him.", "NTA he\u2019s an incompetent adult, father, and spouse. The children are school aged. He has all day to get things done while the children are in school. I used to work with profoundly disabled children. Some couldn\u2019t do anything for themselves and therefore the parents had to do everything for them. The parents still got them to school on time.\n\nIf he can\u2019t do anything, then he\u2019s just another mouth that his wife has to feed and another person for her to look after.", "NTA. I was prepared to call you an AH because waking up at 5 am to keep everything sorted is absolutely insane. But that's not what she's asking for, she's asking for him to cook dinner, get the kids to school, and keep the house semi clean. Then to go and complain to you about it shows no self awareness. He needs to figure this out. These are the basics of being a parent and being an adult. You maybe could have said it nicer, but at worst it was a justified AH move.", "Info \u2014 has your brother ever cleaned? What does he do all day when kids are at school?", "NTA. Don\u2019t encourage mediocrity,  especially in relatives. There are so many men and women out there giving 110% to their families.

He could be dealing with some depression from losing his job, or denial about his new situation- but it\u2019s not an excuse to keep acting this way. \n\nHe\u2019s not just being disrespectful to his wife, he\u2019s setting a horrible example for his children. Marriage is a partnership. Raising children is a privilege. People who aren\u2019t willing to do the bare minimum- tend to lose both those things.", "NTA\n\n\nShe worked part time and did it all.

Yes your brother should step up and do better than he has done, but he shouldn't be compared to the standard set by his wife, because I doubt many people could male or female. It sounds like he wasn't doing much around the house when he was working, which was bad, and he should be learning his lesson, but this is for their family to work out. He likely is depressed from losing his job, and a bit lost from the lack of routine, making him feel like more of a failure isn't going to help him.", "I don\u2019t get what he is doing all day, my kids are in school now too and it take me at most three hours to have the house spotless.", "Struggling with newborn/small babies is completely different to when the kids are in school all day.

He\u2019s not trying.", "There could be a million things going on, and it's just hard to know without being there.\n\nIs he depressed because he lost his job? Is he feeling inadequate?

Did you grow up in a traditional household?\n\nI ask because after reading through the comments a bit, your brother sounds *exactly* like my cousins. Three guys who grew up in a traditional, religious household with a SAHM and grandma who did absolutely *everything* for them. The three boys could do anything they wanted after school and then the one girl had to come help with the chores. And now as adults, those guys can't figure out how to do basic housecleaning. They treat loading a dishwasher like it's rocket science and their wives are constantly in a state of shocked Pikachu as basic life-skill requests of them, like starting the laundry, require their assistance to accomplish.\n\nWas wondering if that may also be the case with y'all.", "NTA and I find it funny that your mom is defending him. Parents need to stop raising sons who are domestically useless (can\u2019t cook, clean, do laundry, grocery shop, look after their children) and expecting potential partners to overlook how useless they are. Bringing home a pay check is not longer enough his wife works and still doesn\u2019t everything else, he has no excuse. \n\nWhat you told him was true, there will be someone out there who is capable of being a good partner for her and if he doesn\u2019t do better she will leave him to find them.", "NTA\n\nNot too surprised by your mothers reaction, mothers are often the cause of their adult sons being useless at adulting!", "NTA.\n\nOf course, there is an adjustment period to go over but this seems like it has happened with him not attempting to better manage his time and adapt to the new circumstances. Being a SAHM isn't difficult (for me at least, but tbf I have only one baby so far AND he is a very easy baby! Circumstances for everyone around different), and once you get the hang of it, the only hiccups are things that you don't expect like a child getting sick, weather, things essentially out of your control.\n\nHe needs to pick up the slack. He just doesn't want to admit he's doing a poor job at what he probably thought was easy since his wife made it look like a breeze. What you said was more or less a harsh way of saying 'shape up, or else', which I think was a reality check. He really expected his wife to get dinner ready whenever she was working full time, and he was doing nothing but caring for the children?.. Yeah, I hope he gets the hang of it, for the sake of his wife and children..", "He probably wondered what she did all day \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23", "NTA. A SAHP with the kids in school? This dude is either having an affair or developed narcolepsy. What is he doing with his time??\n\nNTA", "Truth hurts.", "NTA", "Nta. What the hell does he do for 6-8 hours a day? His hobbies? You are right it is pathetic. He may have never touched a broom before and he could still YouTube a vid on how to clean and tidy up. Or a quick recipe on google. And the kids being late???? I bet he was never late for work.", "Nta. Unless he's disabled in some way, it's really not hard", "NTA. I mean you are objectively correct in your assessment of him.", "NTA - someone needs to tell him the truth. However....\nSomeone should also take him to a doctor. He may need meds if he is depressed. Maybe counseling.", "NTA- cleaning isn\u2019t hard, people just don\u2019t like to do it.

I desperatly need one!", "NTA, more men need to hear the truth.", "NTA. You\u2019re absolutely right about his wife getting fed up and leaving with him. He has 8 hrs to get it together and make sure he\u2019s doing his part. He needs this lesson. Your mom needs to butt out too.", "NTA you are right. He needs to figure out his shit.", "NTA - someone needs to tell him the truth. However....\nSomeone should also take him to a doctor. He may need meds if he is depressed. Maybe counseling.", "NTA \n\nI am a stay at home dad and I have no issues doing everything and raising my kid and still being able to slouch around the couch a few hours a day. It's not that hard if you just do it and get it done right when it needs to be done rather than wait and push it off. He'd feel a lot happier with himself if he just did it.\n\nI think therapy is important for any stay at home parent imo cause it can be mentally stressful dealing with a 3yo terrorist negotiation professional. Only time I can say it should be overwhelming is if you have a huge ass house and multiple hellions. That can be a challenge for sure. But there's no reason the wife should have to come home from work and feel like she has to work more.\n\nMy wife comes home and she takes a bath and decompresses before taking over for the night so I can decompress from the little one before we put him to bed. ROUTINE AND COMMUNICATION ARE NECESSARY", "Nta, good you should always call out weak men who fail their families. This also applies to weak women as well, dont sweep mediocrity under the rug.", "NTA. He expected it from her, he needs to be able to match it.", "NTA\n\nIs your brother incapable of operating a vacuum cleaner? An oven? A slow cooker? An air fryer? Washing machine/dryer? \n\nIt\u2019s never been \u2018easier\u2019 to keep a house up than it is now with the modern conveniences we enjoy and somehow your brother is still managing to fail miserably.\n\nYou can literally go to a supermarket, buy a sauce pack and throw it and along with whatever corresponding protein into a slow cooker and that\u2019s it. Or even just Hamburger helper if we\u2019re really on training wheels, it literally has step by step instructions an 8 year old can follow. \n\nIt\u2019s just kinda sad really. \n\nHopefully your brother pulls his head in.", "NTA. Some truths are hard to hear, but necessary. \n\nIf he truly were trying, there would be an improvement somewhere. With the kids out of the house half the day, he should've plenty of time to get the house shipshape.", "NTA\nShe will leave. He's being unreasonably lazy here. I assume while he was working he was able to set an alarm and get to work on time, he can do that with kids too,  it just takes a little more planning.  8 hours free a day and he can't get dinner together?", "NTA \n\n\nWhile some people's standards are different, he has *no job* and cannot hit the mark on *any* house task. Instead of figuring out how to get the children to school on time, he has you(?!) take them? No. He needs to wake up at least 30-45 minutes earlier so he is completely set first, then start waking his kids up 20 minutes earlier to get them dressed, fed, and ready to go. He's a parent and that's the bare minimum there. \n\n\nHe needs to learn how to cook and have dinner ready, full stop. If he can't maintain the house well, then that's one thing, but at the minimum he needs the family fed and the children cared for. My mother wasn't what anyone would consider a good cook, but some baked chicken or fish, a vegetable (steamed/baked/boiled), and a starch are perfectly nutritious. Making some lunches before going to bed is doable. \n\n\nHe needs to step up.", "NTA. \n\nEverybody has different standards. But to do absolutely nothing, to make your kid consistently late, and to leave the house filthy is not even \"standards\" it's just he's being lazy. You aren't his parents, HE is the parent, he is just using weaponized incompetence to claim he \"can't do it\". \n\nClearly somebody is always going to pick up his slack so why does he have to do things? At some point your SIL will clean the house just because it needs doing, so why bother? You're taking the kids to school, so he doesn't need to work to make that happen. She'll cook dinner if she comes home and it's not ready, he doesn't actually need to do that. \n\nThis happens to women literally everywhere. It doesn't matter if you work or not, the burden of house and child management falls on women. Men will claim they don't know how or weren't raised to be like that. Which is crap, I know plenty of men who were raised \"traditionally\" and still learned to be an equal parent and partner. He just doesn't want to and doesn't care to.", "NTA AT ALL!! Someone had to tell him and I\u2019m so happy you did\u2026 you told him the truth and he needs to grow up and do better because it\u2019s embarrassing and unacceptable What he\u2019s doing now", "Honestly good for you. If I was in this situation with my husband I\u2019d feel a lot better knowing my SIL was backing me up. NTA", "NTA! It\u2019s learned / weaponized incompetence + toxic masculinity that led him here. All those years he could have learned \u2014 as you did! \u2014 how to run the house. So tired of the \u201cmy balls are too heavy so I have to sit on the couch\u201d vibes out of too many of these people. Shouldn\u2019t be on any wife to have to housebreak a husband. Did he live in filth before they married??? Ugh so over this!! So many good friends are stuck with this!!", "Is he being lazy or is he struggling to figure out how to manage a household? Because if this is brand new to him, it might be a week or two before he gets his feet under him. Homemaker is a job, and like most jobs, you get better at it over time by honing your skills.", "NTA, period.", "NTA, he needs to stop making excuses and get to it.", "NTA. Nothing's more pathetic than a BAD stay at home parent. Calling out family for this is practically a moral duty in my book.", "NTA. He has to at least try. There are some things he is going to struggle with, but most of house cleaning is just digging in and getting it done.  \n\nGetting the kids to school on time seems like a no brainer, but is it him or are the kids a struggle for him to get ready?  Are they cooperative or is he struggling to get them dressed, organized and ready? I think your SIL needs to investigate what is going wrong in the morning to address the cause of the situation. \n\nBottom line he needed to be yelled at for a wake up call. What he needs to realize is that your SIL could easily handle it all if she had to. He can\u2019t so he needs to treat it like the very real job it is and actually put the hard work and effort into it.", "NTA.   \nIt's not that difficult.", "SOMEONE needed to be honest with him.

The number of guys who can't do basic adulting is sad.", "NTA\n\nBrother wanted to stay home; he has to do what his wife did.  He has zero excuse, especially since both children are in school, I'm confused at what he does all day.  It takes an hour to clean a house, another hour to cook and maybe an hour to grocery shop and plan a meal.  School pick up and drop off can be a couple of hours. That's 5 hours daily, and I was generous as you don't have to shop daily, that leaves 3 extra hours a day for other things. A few hours a week for laundry, another few to care for the yard.  Bedtime and homework in the evening can be shared responsibilities. I bet when his wife did these things, stayed at home, he didn't help her though. \n\nI bet he thought his wife had it easy.  She should not have to cook when she gets home from work. Maybe he should go back to work.", "As a man, it amazes me how pathetic we are at sucking it up and doing the domestic duties well. Sucks for your SIL, but this is the reality facing most women. There is a reason the marriage and birth rates have dropped in Asia, where men expect women to handle domestic duties despite also now being highly educated and high earning. \u201cIf we men married the women we deserved, we should have a very bad time of it.\u201d", "He\u2019s doing this on purpose. It\u2019s weaponized incompetence. Oh see honey I can\u2019t do it I guess you\u2019ll have to do it while I sit around doing nothing and drinking beer, gee my life is so difficult I deserve a Pat on the back. Seen men like this all the time, I am a man and I know how to do my own laundry, clean and cook. Too many men try to recreate a mommy relationship it\u2019s so gross. No you\u2019re a grown ass adult get off your ass.", "NTA most men are so useless, weaponized incompetence at its finest", ">my mom is now on me for what I said\n\nFound the issue. Your mother should be picking up the slack if she feels so strongly about it. Once SIL figures out she can manage everything with absolutely no help from him, she will move him out", "NTA do you think he is being lazy or is it because he is having a rough time,  he lost his job and is now failing at being a stay at home dad,  it doesn't make his task easier. \n\nI'm not suggesting he should be pampered , I'm not suggesting anything,  just saying it is hard for a lot of people failing and asking for help,  and it doesn't help if you already in a bad place.  it could sound like he needs help getting started and being used to do something he might not be very good at.  \n\nmaybe he should make a schedule and then text his wife updates,  until he gets used to it", "can we see rachel\u2019s schedule i would also like to learn \ud83d\ude2d but no your brother is an ass. NTA.", "There may have been a more subtle way to share your insights, but bottom line you are right; the basics of cleaning up and cooking Mac and cheese shouldn't be too hard to master if you're home full-time.\n\nI do understand his struggles though, as it may seem like (or is) an impossible task to do it exactly right as his wife did, which may be very demotivating.\n\nI have actively - almost professionally - dodged ironing the kids school uniforms for 5 years now: my partner does it with care and everything comes out perfect. When my partner was sick for a longer period of time, there came the point I HAD to do it and jeez it took me a good couple tries and seriously lowered my expectations to get through that. \n\nJust saying: it's a learning curve and I would understand him being overwhelmed by having to do everything his wife did. Would he be open for some help and advice on how to get the basics done?", "Mm I kinda thing you were a bit too harsh. Sure he needs to figure it out but to tell him his wife is going to leave him? Dick move. \n\nI\u2019m not saying he should get away with it but he just lost his job 2 months ago. Let\u2019s say the first 2 weeks, he struggled with not having to go in, feeling less than, inadequate, etc. He is trying to find his new normal of being at home. Maybe he took it for granted how easy she made it but how much help has she been to him to get him adjusted? Did she throw him in the deep end? Which before anyone comes at me saying he\u2019s a dad and not knowing makes him pathetic- tell me could you do a complete 180 and be perfect at it?

(Which is already awesome to have, but is clearly not working in this situation.) Maybe on a weekend or day that OP or wife has off, they can walk through a normal day\u2019s schedule (maybe not the full thing wife was doing as it does sound like wife was a superstar, but a day\u2019s schedule that everyone agrees would get an adequate amount done). Instead of just giving him a list, maybe demonstrate how to do some of the things but then let him do it on his own.

However, it's also a possibility his perspective was at fault, and that can't be discounted.\n\nA lot of people are under the impression being a SAHP is not a job and think that it's their opportunity to do whatever they want all day (my dad always joked my mom was hanging out watching TV and eating bonbons all day). Then their world comes crashing down on them when they realize there are actually tasks expected of them. This perspective is often more common in men (for the time being, as we're really not too far away from the old ways and there is still plenty of residue left).\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not exclusively targeting men, here. It's easy for a lot of employed people to see SAHPs as having it easy because they've never done it themselves.

I absolutely think he should see a counselor and have a clinical assessment done to see if he has depression. I also think that even when we are depressed, we still need to be parents.

That doesn't even mean going above and beyond like your SIL, not all of us can be over-achievers. But spending some time every day tidying the house is the least he can do.

Also she loves leftover night that is on Thursday.\n\nSometimes she will do a roast or a meat on Sunday and it can used all week, so she cooked a ton of chicken you have chicken wraps, tacos, soup and so on. As it cooks you clean, you don\u2019t need to watch the soup boiling clean the counter or something.\n\nCleaning is a rotation, you clean two rooms everyday no matter what ( always the most used room, so for me is kitchen and living room) Then rotate the rooms the rest of the week. Monday you do bathroom and then Tuesday a different room and so on. The rooms most used will pop up in your rotation more\n\nThe biggest tip she gave me was cleaning as you go. You take out a screwdriver you put back the screwdriver not leave it out. Making a game if you have young ones to help clean up, I used a big stuff dog and if it was dirty.

I wake up feeling energetic, clean , and promise to follow my schedule. A few weeks later, my mood drops, and my house gets destroyed.\n\nHaving a job helps, when I was unemployed my depression cycle got so much more dramatic because I had no structure to my life(I assume OP is stuggling for that reason but he needs to figure it out) House is way cleaner now that I work until 2 and have 2-3 hours of cleaning/relaxing time when I get home.", "I try to have a consistent schedule:\n\n\\- Thursdays I have off so I use them for deep-ish cleaning (vacuum cleaner, dust, bathroom, plus a bit of mopping) and for watering the plants if they don't look like they need it before in the week.

Thursdays I do towels (after I finish the bathroom), Fridays white(ish) coton, Mondays colors, Tuesdays and Wednesdays fragile things.\n\n\\- weekends are for buying things at the local farmers' market and batch cooking with my SO, I try to get at least two/three meals + a soup for the evening during the week (the soup is not enough, but I need to adapt each evening meal to what he eats for lunch since he can't have a consistent eating schedule at his job).\n\n\\- the rest I try to schedule on Sundays for the week. Are the windows dirty? Does the bed need changing? Do I need to do things on the balcony ( I have a few plants and delicious herbs + the occasional sweeping)? When was the last time I vacuumed under the sofa again? Do I need to go grocery shopping and what will the weather look like (I do that on a bicycle)?\n\nOf course I only have a part time job in a two-people household, so that makes it easier. I couldn't imagine doing so much with a full-time job - though when I had one SO took his part and did it well.\n\nThe very best tip I ever got was that \"meh, I'll do it later\" = it will never get done because I will never think about it again, no matter how good my intentions are. \"I'll do it Tuesday at 4pm\" DOES get done though.", "[removed]", "I don't think he is anything but lazy (again unless there is something clinically wrong), but I also don't think its anyone's responsibility but his own to get himself into gear.
