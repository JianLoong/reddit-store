Losing a job can be a real blow for a lot of reasons, and if he's struggling with that, it could affect his performance as a STAHP, which then also builds on mental struggles because he's failing at that too.\n\nMy original reaction was that it is in fact \"pathetic\" that he can't manage the kids, even with a learning curve of routine/skills he might not have.

He is doing his best but sadly he sucks at it. It's not like he can't be bothered to look after the house and Kids and plays video games all day.\nDid you ever consider that it might have been hard on your brother that he lost his job? \nNo because you are busy kicking him while he is already on the ground.", "NTA, he is obviously failing at his job and does not want to admit it, if its going to lead to a divorce, he needs to pick stuff up to not be left in the dust", "NTA - maybe saying his wife will divorce him was taking it a little too far, but he is a grown man who should be able to take care of a house and kids. He\u2019s had years to learn from his wife and never took any interest assuming she would always be the one to do everything, and now he\u2019s hopefully finally appreciating how hard she works to keep everything in order. He\u2019s learning a life lesson and he doesn\u2019t like it. Kudos to you for sticking by your SIL - she\u2019s probably been trying to get him more involved for years and now she has someone on her side.", "NTA... he used to have it all easy and done while he went out for work surely not realizing the ammount of work manteining a household and getting kids ready really is.\n\nYou just told him the truth of what will happen if he doesnt put his shit together and start doing the chores he needs to be doing as a husband and a parent...", "NTA.  Your brother is your wife's 3rd child.  He is pathetic. He is a loser. She will divorce him.", "NTA he\u2019s an incompetent adult, father, and spouse. The children are school aged. He has all day to get things done while the children are in school. I used to work with profoundly disabled children. Some couldn\u2019t do anything for themselves and therefore the parents had to do everything for them. The parents still got them to school on time.\n\nIf he can\u2019t do anything, then he\u2019s just another mouth that his wife has to feed and another person for her to look after.", "NTA. I was prepared to call you an AH because waking up at 5 am to keep everything sorted is absolutely insane. But that's not what she's asking for, she's asking for him to cook dinner, get the kids to school, and keep the house semi clean. Then to go and complain to you about it shows no self awareness. He needs to figure this out. These are the basics of being a parent and being an adult. You maybe could have said it nicer, but at worst it was a justified AH move.", "Info \u2014 has your brother ever cleaned? What does he do all day when kids are at school?", "NTA. Don\u2019t encourage mediocrity,  especially in relatives. There are so many men and women out there giving 110% to their families. There are plenty of single dad\u2019s who cook, clean, show up for their kids, and work full time- without a wife supporting them financially. \n\nHe honestly sounds like he needs some therapy. He could be dealing with some depression from losing his job, or denial about his new situation- but it\u2019s not an excuse to keep acting this way. \n\nHe\u2019s not just being disrespectful to his wife, he\u2019s setting a horrible example for his children. Marriage is a partnership. Raising children is a privilege. People who aren\u2019t willing to do the bare minimum- tend to lose both those things.", "NTA\n\n\nShe worked part time and did it all. He has no job at all and can't even somewhat cut it. How the fuck were the kids late?! I mean, one time can always happen, but consitently? \n\n\nI think being a sahp IS hard. But with both kids going to school, he should have the time to do the most of it.", "NTA overall but pathetic was harsh and would have been very hard to hear. Everything else needed saying otherwise he would have continued making excuses.", "NTA. Honestly you\u2019re right. If he cannot prove that that system will work, SIL may realize that she doesn\u2019t really need him as a partner if he can\u2019t earn his keep. \n\nI get that it\u2019s a rough adjustment he has to make, but he\u2019s not getting any aspect of a stay at home parent right. Especially considering the fact that he\u2019s not working, and the kids are at school for a good chunk of the day.\n\nThe fact that SIL was able to do it all with non-school aged kids, while also working part time should be a wake up call. Chances are she could probably manage without him if it came down to it.", "NTA - you're right", "Nta\n\nThat surprises me, as every male stay at home parent I\u2019ve known as absolutely rocked it.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely lame.\n\nTo be fair though, not everyone can self motivate.", "NTA - my dad did everything when we were kids. All the cooking and cleaning and school runs, extracurricular activity runs, lunches, bath times EVERYTHING. Men are absolutely just as capable to do the things that are often left to women. For some reason so many of them think they can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t have to.", "YTA It sounds like his wife was really dedicated which is great, but many stay at home parents would find getting up at 5am to start meal prepping, etc. difficult. Yes your brother should step up and do better than he has done, but he shouldn't be compared to the standard set by his wife, because I doubt many people could male or female. It sounds like he wasn't doing much around the house when he was working, which was bad, and he should be learning his lesson, but this is for their family to work out. He likely is depressed from losing his job, and a bit lost from the lack of routine, making him feel like more of a failure isn't going to help him.", "I don\u2019t get what he is doing all day, my kids are in school now too and it take me at most three hours to have the house spotless.", "Struggling with newborn/small babies is completely different to when the kids are in school all day. He needs to figure it out.", "He\u2019s still doing his hobbies and has never mentioned any mental issues. He\u2019s never had a history of depression for my knowledge. In his rants he goes on about it\u2019s unfair but never mentions any signs of depression.", "The wife should just shut up IMO", "I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s not cleaning that for sure. The house is gross now. The kitchen is awful. It\u2019s been two months since he started the kids have been in school for 3 full weeks at this point. We are on week four. I don\u2019t know what he is doing, I shared my routine thinking he just needed a routine but he isn\u2019t doing it.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten so many calls, from him and a few times I had to come over since he was overwhelmed\u2026", "The kid are suppose to be dropped off at 7:30-8, class is at 8:15. He has been getting them there at 8:30 most days. I don\u2019t get it. I\u2019ve been late a few times but the school has to talk to him about it\n\nHell the bus is an option but you have to wake up earlier for that", "> but pathetic was harsh\n\nMaybe, but an adult man not knowing how to cook or clean is pathetic. Especially when either takes 5s to figure out with the help of the internet. That he can't be bothered to do that and let's his wife deal with it is even more pathetic.\n\nSometimes it's hard to hear the truth, doesn't make it any less true.", "No one is expecting him to get up at 5 and meal prep. They're expecting him to use the 6hrs he is home alone with no other responsibilities to do basic household management.", "Oh boo hoo! He can\u2019t even get the children to school in time. He\u2019s not trying.", "There could be a million things going on, and it's just hard to know without being there.\n\nIs he depressed because he lost his job? Is he feeling inadequate? Is he feeling resentful because somewhere in the back of his mind he's struggling with the swap in gender roles (I don't like jumping straight into this assumption, but it *certainly* isn't unheard of)? Or, is he simply lazy?\n\nDid your SIL give him her schedule, also?\n\n**Edit: INFO:** How old are your brother and SIL?", "Bless your heart.", "I gave him a schedule and so did SIL. I\u2019ve been over so many times, he\u2019s not doing anything. The house is gross and the kitchen is the worse.", "Sorry to keep interrogating you... was his and your mother a SAHM? Did you grow up in a traditional household?\n\nI ask because after reading through the comments a bit, your brother sounds *exactly* like my cousins. Three guys who grew up in a traditional, religious household with a SAHM and grandma who did absolutely *everything* for them. The three boys could do anything they wanted after school and then the one girl had to come help with the chores. And now as adults, those guys can't figure out how to do basic housecleaning. They treat loading a dishwasher like it's rocket science and their wives are constantly in a state of shocked Pikachu as basic life-skill requests of them, like starting the laundry, require their assistance to accomplish.\n\nWas wondering if that may also be the case with y'all."]}
