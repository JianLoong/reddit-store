While it wasn't a planned pregnancy, they do plan to keep the baby.\n\nMy brother's gf started saying how lucky she is that she'd found a man like my brother, as most men she'd met were only interested in having sex with her and didn't want to be tied down to a blind person and I made a joke about how most women wouldn't even look at my brother, so he's also just as lucky that he found someone like her. I thought people would laugh at my joke, but instead it just created an awkward atmosphere and my brother just looked embarrassed. Soon enough the gathering ended and my parents approached me to say that I was out of line with what I said about my brother, especially knowing how much he struggled with insecurity issues when it comes to his looks and that I should apologize to him for ruining such a celebratory moment for him. I don't understand how my joke could've ruined my brother's moment, especially cause I've always made jokes about his looks an he'd always laugh them off, but my parents insist I apologize to him for what I said at the gathering.\n\nAITA or are my parents just overreacting ?\n\nEdit: Spelling.", "created_utc": 1673986685, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ema43/aita_for_making_a_joke_about_my_brothers_looks_to/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Well, his girlfriend is blind (and also the hottest girl my brother has managed to pick up) and yesterday they've had a family gathering to announce that she's pregnant. While it wasn't a planned pregnancy, they do plan to keep the baby.\n\nMy brother's gf started saying how lucky she is that she'd found a man like my brother, as most men she'd met were only interested in having sex with her and didn't want to be tied down to a blind person and I made a joke about how most women wouldn't even look at my brother, so he's also just as lucky that he found someone like her. I thought people would laugh at my joke, but instead it just created an awkward atmosphere and my brother just looked embarrassed. Soon enough the gathering ended and my parents approached me to say that I was out of line with what I said about my brother, especially knowing how much he struggled with insecurity issues when it comes to his looks and that I should apologize to him for ruining such a celebratory moment for him. I don't understand how my joke could've ruined my brother's moment, especially cause I've always made jokes about his looks an he'd always laugh them off, but my parents insist I apologize to him for what I said at the gathering.\n\nAITA or are my parents just overreacting ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Don't expect him to necessarily forgive you or tell you it's no big deal.  \n\nAlso, he does not need to explain to you why your behaviour was hurtful.  Maybe this situation is different than in the past, or maybe it's always bothered him and he hasn't bothered saying so.

Regardless, you continue to make \u2018jokes\u2019 which is almost the literal definition of a bully.\n\nThe one place a person deserves to feel safe is when they are with family. He shouldn\u2019t have to worry about his younger brother bullying him. Grow TF up and quit putting other people down to make yourself feel better.\n\nEdit: changed phrasing", "YTA Made a disparaging remark about your brother\u2019s looks, probably something he\u2019s had issues with at some point, and can\u2019t understand how you ruined his moment. So you have looks, something completely superficial, but zero intelligence. Sounds like your brother won the gene pool in reality then.", "what is your damage?! OBVI YTA!!", "Yta why would calling someone ugly be funny? You should apologize to your brother.", "What is attractiveness though? That\u2019s in the mind and heart of the beholder. Every person is different. What you find attractive might be absolutely unattractive to someone else. So YTA. They are happy together and that\u2019s the main thing. You were just being cruel masked as a joke.", "That's the type of joke you can pull off with the right delivery and a great existing relationship with the people it's about. \n\nGiven the reaction it seems unlikely this is the case.", "The vibe I\u2019m getting from this post is like the episode of Family Guy where Brian dates a blind girl and tries to hide the fact he\u2019s a dog. Anybody else feel the same?", "Just remember that looks fade, but you\u2019ll always be an arrogant asshole. YTA", "Let's just say I'd have gotten physical with you. YTA", "YTA Major one too. For the same reason as most of the other comments. Even though u claim it just a joke a shit one if u ask me but u constantly make the same one all the time about his looks and u say he just laughed them off before he just fake laughing to just to move on from it not that he actually thinks ur joke is funny. Making the same shitty joke over and over gets annoying. So yeah u better apologize to ur brother and gf if u still want a relationship with ur brother in future because if u don't change ur attitude don't be surprised if he cuts u out of his life and u acting like a victim.", "YTA", "So basically, you've always been an asshole, why would they expect you to stop now?

I read this title and for some reason thought you'd meant you said something stupid like \"good thing you can't see his new pink hair it looks terrible\" which would have been crappy as it pokes fun at her blindness. but wow. Way to exceed expectations!", "YTA.\n\nIf you don't even have your own brother's back, you aren't much of a brother. You always talk family UP, never down, unless they're disowned. What you did was un-brotherly.\n\nIt wasn't a joke, it was an attack when put him down in front of his girl rather than have his back and talk him up. It is not the same as if you were ball tapping each other in private, you did it in front of his girl.   \n\n\nIf you don't see why that is wrong, you may have a mental disability pertaining to understanding social situations. \n\nYou are a bad brother.", "YTA. My mind was made up from the first paragraph alone.", "YTA. To boil it down\u2026at a party celebrating your brother\u2019s baby announcement, you called him ugly and basically told his girlfriend she\u2019s too good-looking for him.", "YTA for having a big head but small brain to understand that you should not make fun of someone's insecurity.", "So what you are saying is that you've always been an asshole to your brother.\nGot it!\nYTA and quite frankly I'd bet you are nothing but a frat boy clown show. Way to be a good brother man.....", "YTA. How is this funny?", "YTA-Don\u2019t know how many \u201cGene pools\u201d you swam around in before being foisted upon the world, but apparently all of them were void of empathy, decency, tact, or intelligence. Asshole. Big time.", "Bring British I can see how some people have that take the piss banter sense of humour.

YTA", "YTA \n\nYour brother might not be 'conventionally attractive' (God I hate that phrase), but you have just proved you are grotesquely ugly on the inside. \n\nCongratulations, you're a d*ck.", "YTA you managed to insult both your brother and his girlfriend on their biggest insecurities, congrats", "So you brought up your brothers main insecurity, referred to his blind partner as \"someone like you\" ( as though her disability is her defining feature) and are wondering how it could have ruined their moment?  Is this real? \nBanter is all well and good within established limits but there are lines you don't cross. \nBringing up something that someone has struggled with emotionally Is an incredibly horrible thing to do. \nAlso saying that he \"wasn't as lucky in the gene pools as me\" makes you seem unbelievably arrogant, which I don't think is a position you should be taking. I'm sure being attractive is nice but people prefer to spend time with people who are empathetic and thoughtful- perhaps those were the genes that skipped you.", "YTA and a bigger one for having to question it. Woooooow. Self awareness dude. Try it", "YTA - yeah I bet the brother never really laughed at being called ugly by his sibling. Not a single person on this planet enjoys being constantly reminded that they are not conventionally attractive. That is just so gross.", "YTA and a bully. Apparently you can't see that though, so I'll ask you, what makes your \"joke\" funny? What is it in the context of that \"joke\" that you think would make people laugh? Answer: Your brothers humiliation. That's bullying.", "YTA, one of those guys that is a bully and then tries to excuse their poor behaviour by saying \"it was only a joke\". You went too far. \n\nWhat did you expect when posting this here, waiting for the delete and lock.", "YTA. Not even gonna explain why.", "I mean\u2026I\u2019m not gonna lie, I laughed lol but YTA, you didn\u2019t need to make an ugly joke at that specific time lol and you managed to insult her at the same time which is\u2026you must have a lot of practice.", "YTA. It's not a cool thing to say, especially in front of others. You owe him an apology, and if he shares what he really feels about you, deal with it", "YTA. It's not a joke, it's straight up horrible. Are you the kind of person who is cruel to family and friends and acts like it's \"jUsT a JOkE!\" when they are rightly offended? Do you take accountability for your behavior when you make mistakes, or just blame it on everything and everybody else?", "YTA", "Op you should post a picture of yourself and let us decide if you really won the gene lottery. I feel like you're just as ugly outside as you are inside.", "YTA You may think you\u2019re pretty on the outside, but you\u2019re definitely ugly. You insulted them both and should apologize, but don\u2019t be surprised when they tell you to beat it. Wow. My mouth literally fell open.", "Ok, I know most people are going with YTA and I would probably agree with them but with that said, I honestly would probably fuck with them too. even if the brother was the most handsome man in the world I would still give them shit about how ugly he is and its a good thing she doesn't have to see his face and stuff like that. But, I am a self admitted asshole.", "You are dumb as hell", ">especially knowing how much he struggled with insecurity issues when it comes to his looks\n\n>I've always made jokes about his looks\n\nYTA for lots of reasons in this but these quotes should sum it up.", "\"especially knowing how much he struggled with insecurity issues when it comes to his looks\"\n\nYou're not funny and the day was not about you. Your brother was giving you pity laughs. Also, you took a moment of public praise from his GF and ruined it. You sound very narcissistic.", "INFO: are you willing to post a picture of yourself so we can all judge your physical appearance?", "YTA.\n\nDo you realise \"attractive\" people are also unlucky in finding a partner? Just cause you have good looks and score more woman doesnt make you lucky. It just means more people who dont want to be tied down want to sleep with you.\n\nI have had many attractive girl friends and guys only wnated to f*ck them. They were always sad that they can't fint a proper bf. Aka exactly what this girl was saying to you.\n\nWether you are attractive or non attractive to most people doesn't make a difference. Its hard finding someone you can actually build a relationship with. You dont have to be universally attractive to be attractive either. People find different things amd different looks attractive. Not just \"gene pools\".\n\nThey seem to be happy and they are lucky to have found each because they both found someone they can trust and love which is hard to find.\n\nHow is is being \"blessed with genes\" working out for your relationship?

You're sick. And you are most definitely more than just an AH. I'm frankly shocked your family still talks to you. They need better boundaries.", "How can you not see that YTA here? A huge one at that!\n\nWho care that you have put him down all of his life because you are clearly shallow and think yourself to be a looker? That was not the time or place to insult your brother's look especially when his gf was talking about how special he is. It seems to me that you may be a bit jealous that he found someone who love him for HIM. I imagine people are interested in your looks and then have second thoughts when they get to know who you are inside.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nDo you not see the correlation with these 2 statements:\n\n>especially knowing how much he struggled with insecurity issues when it comes to his looks\n\n>especially cause I've always made jokes about his looks an he'd always laugh them off", "YTA", "YTA and dumb. \"Laughing them off\" is not consent for this type of joke.

Think before you speak.", "WOW. Do you even like your brother??  YTA , there's no universe where you're not TA, and the fact that you're even asking makes you even MORE TA.
