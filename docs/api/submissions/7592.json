Well, his girlfriend is blind (and also the hottest girl my brother has managed to pick up) and yesterday they've had a family gathering to announce that she's pregnant. While it wasn't a planned pregnancy, they do plan to keep the baby.\n\nMy brother's gf started saying how lucky she is that she'd found a man like my brother, as most men she'd met were only interested in having sex with her and didn't want to be tied down to a blind person and I made a joke about how most women wouldn't even look at my brother, so he's also just as lucky that he found someone like her. I thought people would laugh at my joke, but instead it just created an awkward atmosphere and my brother just looked embarrassed. Soon enough the gathering ended and my parents approached me to say that I was out of line with what I said about my brother, especially knowing how much he struggled with insecurity issues when it comes to his looks and that I should apologize to him for ruining such a celebratory moment for him. I don't understand how my joke could've ruined my brother's moment, especially cause I've always made jokes about his looks an he'd always laugh them off, but my parents insist I apologize to him for what I said at the gathering.\n\nAITA or are my parents just overreacting ?\n\nEdit: Spelling.", "created_utc": 1673986685, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ema43/aita_for_making_a_joke_about_my_brothers_looks_to/", "score": 689, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My brother wasn't as lucky in the gene pools as me and he isn't someone you'd consider conventionally attractive. He's a good guy, just not lucky with girls or dating in general. Well, his girlfriend is blind (and also the hottest girl my brother has managed to pick up) and yesterday they've had a family gathering to announce that she's pregnant. While it wasn't a planned pregnancy, they do plan to keep the baby.\n\nMy brother's gf started saying how lucky she is that she'd found a man like my brother, as most men she'd met were only interested in having sex with her and didn't want to be tied down to a blind person and I made a joke about how most women wouldn't even look at my brother, so he's also just as lucky that he found someone like her. I thought people would laugh at my joke, but instead it just created an awkward atmosphere and my brother just looked embarrassed. Soon enough the gathering ended and my parents approached me to say that I was out of line with what I said about my brother, especially knowing how much he struggled with insecurity issues when it comes to his looks and that I should apologize to him for ruining such a celebratory moment for him. I don't understand how my joke could've ruined my brother's moment, especially cause I've always made jokes about his looks an he'd always laugh them off, but my parents insist I apologize to him for what I said at the gathering.\n\nAITA or are my parents just overreacting ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Don't expect him to necessarily forgive you or tell you it's no big deal.  \n\nAlso, he does not need to explain to you why your behaviour was hurtful.  Maybe this situation is different than in the past, or maybe it's always bothered him and he hasn't bothered saying so.  It might be that your comment reminded him of situations in the past where you or others made him feel bad about himself.  It might be that it upset him to have his fiancee hear him being insulted.
