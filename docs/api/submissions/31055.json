Then we became friends with a married couple. My fianc\u00e9 and the guy REALLY hit it off. Talked daily. He, too, had a blended family, but his marriage was going sour (sex less than once a month, she's a SAHM who refused to clean the house, take care of the farm animals,  or the kids) and he complained the stepkids were lazy and refused to help out. Suddenly, my fianc\u00e9 started having the EXACT same complaints (although it was BS, we had sex ~2 times a week, kids all helped). He began to yell at my kids for doing things that he was fine with his son doing. He started only asking his son for help (even if all 3 were together), and I'd have to ask my boys to go after them and help. Then I found out he's been complaining to anyone who'd listen how we never have sex and my boys are lazy and won't help do anything.
