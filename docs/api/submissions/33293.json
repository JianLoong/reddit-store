We have a very kind colleague, \u201cMargie\u201d, who is having a rough year. She does so much for everyone, on and off the clock yet very few reciprocate. I decided to take up a collection to get her a nice Christmas gift. Everyone gave between $5-10, including a newer colleague, \u201cRose\u201d. This was no pressure but everyone agreed Margie deserved it.\n\nAs I collected the money, I bought the gifts. Everyone agreed on what to get, I just went out and bought it, wrapped it, etc. We\u2019re giving it to her on Friday, our last work day before the holiday. \n\nRose resigned over the weekend. A little after our boss announced this, I got an email from Rose asking for her money back. I explained it was already spent, which she already knew as I sent a group email out last week showing pictures of the gifts. She said that as she didn\u2019t work there anymore, she didn\u2019t want to contribute. I repeated that the money was already spent and I wouldn\u2019t be refunding her anything. \n\nShe then requested $10 from me via Cash App. I denied it. \n\nSome colleagues feel I should just return it. Others agree it was a gift and she can\u2019t take it back.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702912847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lb77s/aita_for_not_refunding_money_someone_gave_for_a/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Next time spend your own $$ or take Margie to lunch.", "Workplace gifts where people feel pressured to contribute (even if subtly) are always a bit iffy anyway. It sounds like Rose wasn't there long enough to have a real emotional investment and might be really tight on funds (especially depending on why she \"resigned\" and what her new situation is). Soft YTA here. I would give her the $10 back.", "I would return the money in this situation.  If she resigned so suddenly, it sounds like there may be something serious going on in her life and she may now urgently need the money.", "YTA  The pressure to give group gifts in offices needs to stop, If you want to give her a gift do it on your own Don't involve other people.", "NAH op - you didn\u2019t know she would resign and Rose clearly was expecting the gift to be different and no obligation should be that. Also seems like you have a closer relationship to Margie and if 10 isn\u2019t a big deal, just pay it back to save office drama. \n\nI would change it to a leaving present and create a card to thanking her for all the support she has provided the team - get each person that contributed to sign this card with a note.", "NTA but is $10 worth the drama?", "I\u2019d give the money back", "NTA.", "Info: did you set it up in way that would let you know who contributed and who didn't?", "I dunno.

I'm sure the OP had good intentions, but given how persistent Rose is being in asking for the money, it seems (rightly or wrongly) like she did feel some level of obligation to contribute at the time she was asked.  Personally, I wouldn't want that on my conscience, as it taints the spirit in which the gift was intended to be given.  It would probably be a better idea to make any donations anonymous in future, just have a bucket on a desk and give people a cut off date to contribute if they want to.", "How petty does one have to be to demand a refund for a group gift, especially one of such low value?\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nShe knows the money is spend, it\u2019s on her she quit, she was probably already looking for another job, stupid if her to contribute \n\nThe colleagues who is saying you should pay her back could pay her back together, it\u2019s always easy to judge others when it\u2019s free of charge for them", "NTA\n\nUmm, this isn't Macy's, you don't get a refund.

The post literally said rose even chipped in despite her being a new employee. A gift is a gift, you don\u2019t get your money back.", "There is something more going on in her life if she is being so insistent over $5-$10? If she has left, most normal people would just leave and move on and not be petty about $10. What's up with that?\n\nI totally agree, however, that OP shouldn't pay it back unless this person is like, literally on the streets without her $5. She paid into a gift fund; the gift was bought; the fund is no more.\n\nETA: NTA , OP"]}
