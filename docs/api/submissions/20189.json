{"id": 20189, "submission_id": "14ehss0", "title": "AITA for calling my friend out after she and her bf fought in front of me?", "selftext": "\rThis Saturday was my (27F) birthday. I planned a dinner at my favorite restaurant and drinks at a bar with Carly (27F), Carly's boyfriend Nate (31M), and another friend. Nate and Carly spend every weekend at bars, so this night was not out of the ordinary for them.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I first mentioned the dinner to Carly, she asked if Nate could come, and I said yes. The day of, Carly texted me to ask if we could do dinner at 7:30, and I said yes.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I got to Carly's place, she said we couldn't go yet because Nate wasn't there yet and he would be another 20 minutes.\r  \n\r  \nI counted the time and realized that with that delay, we would get to the restaurant too late. I asked if Nate could meet us at the restaurant because he'd be driving past it, and Carly said Nate wouldn't do that and that if he didn't ride with us, she didn't want him to come. \r  \n\r  \nI let it go and just picked a different restaurant, then coordinated with my other friend. \r  \n\r  \nWhen he got there, Carly followed Nate into the bedroom, and they started fighting. The apartment is small, so I heard everything. I learned that Nate had already eaten dinner and didn't want to come with us, but Carly insisted. \r  \n\r  \nI missed going to my favorite restaurant so Nate could come, even though he didn't actually want to in the first place. I didn't say anything to them about it, and after 10 minutes of fighting, they came out of the bedroom and we left. \r  \n\r  \nThey continued to fight in front of me in the car and in front of my friend and I at the restaurant. \r  \n\r  \nThe night was super awkward. They barely talked to anyone else and spent the night arguing with each other, and not quietly either. \r  \n\r  \nI saw Carly again yesterday, and she was complaining to me about a couple she knows that fight in front of her all the time. I said something like, \"oh, like you and Nate did on my birthday?\"\r  \n\r  \nI thought it was fine to tease her about this. \r  \n\r  \nIt was not fine. She got really mad at me. \r  \n\r  \nI tried to deescalate and say that it was fine, it just made the night awkward for me. I said that I was grateful to her and Nate for taking me and my friend around and I had a good night, but I could tell Carly didn't have fun. \r  \n\r  \nCarly was still very upset about it and got defensive. \r  \n\r  \nI got kind of mad too and asked her what they'd been fighting about all night. I already knew what it was about and knew that it was petty, but Carly explained it again. I asked why she couldn't put that aside for one night and just have fun with me. \r  \n\r  \nCarly said I didn't understand relationships at all. I reminded her that while I have been single for 2 years, I was in a very committed relationship for 6 years, and that I very much understood what it was like to fight with your partner, but being unable to put that aside and spend time with your best friend on her birthday wasn't cool. Instead, Carly chose to feed into the fight and the bad energy and ruin the vibe. \r  \n\r  \nShe called me an AH.

And because of her, your plans had to be changed and at last minute. \n\nIt was incredibly rude and childish for them to fight in front of you guys the whole night.", "NOPE. Carly shows a shocking lack of empathy and grace. It\u2019s like she\u2019s in her own little bubble and can\u2019t figure out that the world around her doesn\u2019t stop when she\u2019s angry. Callous is one of the gentler words I\u2019d apply to her.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Lack of self-awareness on Carly's part. You shouldn't have to apologize for calling a spade a spade to Carly. She has a twisted view of what is healthy relationship behavior.", "NTA.  You should have called her both out immediately.  \"Carly, I am not going to miss my reservation because Nate will be here late and you insist on waiting for him.  I changed the time of my reservation for you and now you are going to make me miss it.\"  Then leave.  They sound horrible, especially Carly, and would not consider it a loss.", "Nta.

This was about YOUR day, your BIRTHDAY! This wasn't just some random night out. She ruined it for you and she so needs to absolutely and sincerely apologize to you. You have every right to feel let down by her.", "NTA. She\u2019s being a hypocrite and apparently like most hypocrites, doesn\u2019t like it to be pointed out to them. You are t wrong here", "NTA - She shouldn't have made you change your plans for her boyfriend. And she probably git really defensive because she knows you're right and is embarrassed.", "NTA Carly sucks and made the entire night, YOUR BIRTHDAY, about her! You have every right to be upset with her, it was selfish. Why did she need Nate to come so badly? There was more focus on him (who also sounds like an ass) than on you. New friend time!", "NTA\n\nYou were accommodating and said that her boy friend could come.\nYou were accommodating and let her dictate the time of dinner.\nYou were even accommodating when her boyfriend was late and you couldn\u2019t eat at your favorite restaurant.\nYou were accommodating and changed the meal time and the restaurant and coordinated it with your other friend.\nAND then on top of this, you had to listen to her argue with her boyfriend all night on YOUR birthday.\n\nCarly definitely owes you an apology, quite a few of them if we are being honest.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt sounds like Carly was completely in the wrong, refused to take some good natured ribbing, and then doubled down and tried to hurt your feelings. You are not the asshole OP", "NTA\n\nNot even close.", "NTA and if relationships like that are normal according to Carly, i dont think i understand relationships either, because mine is nothing like that.", "NTA. I think you've been more than fair to her, and now it's on her to be sensible and introspect.", "NTAH.", "NTA\n\nThose two completely sucked the air out of the room with no shame and now Carly's ego is in the way of admitting it and apologizing.", "NTA\n\nHer lack of empathy and awareness is strange.

It may be time to stop going out with Carly, you've outgrown her. She made your birthday a manipulation tool to test her bf and relationship, at your expense.

Which is Definitely the case here, as Carly is also too immature to realise she's not creating a healthy relationship with her partner or her friends", "NTA.

She made your birthday about her.\n\nI'd tell Carly that she can't bring Nate with her anymore, or else she will also no longer be invited to outings. How immature. Not even worth your time or energy tbvh.", "NTA but please find a new friend. I had a \u201cCarly\u201d myself, who never had any regard for others in timeliness & never liked to admit wrong.

If she doesn't take it like a good friend should then maybe your friendship is more one sided then you think it is.", "NTA - You're supposed to be able to call out your friends when they mess up, otherwise how will they know and do better next time? \n\nI'm not sure what kind of dynamic you have with your friend, obviously, it's different for everyone. When I'm asked for my opinion, or someone's done wrong by me, I'm very honest, but I'm also good with words and phrasing my point of view. My honesty doesn't gel well with many, so the few friends I do have are lifelong keepers that appreciate that from me. If you have to tiptoe around your friend's feelings while she stomps around on yours on your birthday, that's a bit of a problem.\n\nIn your shoes, I'd have insisted Nate stay at the apartment. There's no reason to drag someone out who is just going to be a big gloomy cloud over the whole evening.", "NTA, Carly is extremely oblivious and selfish for hijacking and ruining your birthday. To then have the gall to be mad at you because she got called out for being a hypocrite is hilarious. She's clearly not concerned with being a good friend, she only cares about herself.", "NTA rinds me of the opening of Little Monsters lmao dude and his gf and a montage of them having the same fight loud and drama fight over and over, even at dinner with friends and in the convenience store.", "NTA\nFor pointing out her hypocritical behavior. But please shiny up that spine and walk away from the boundary pushing early. When you found out that Nate didn\u2019t want to be there ten min into the fight was 30 min too late. \n\nI\u2019m not keen pn spending time with people who don\u2019t want to spend time with me, so they would have walked out to an empty apartment. No company is truly better than the wrong company", "This is what you should have done.\n\nBy not doing this, you are enabling her selfish, bad behaviour.", "Aren\u2019t*", "You'd be surprised just how many people have no idea what a healthy relationship looks like. If you described it too them bthey'd think you lived in La la land"]}
