We\u2019re hoping this settles it once and for all.\n\nMy (22f at the time) college roommate (also 22f at the time) had a friend from her hometown visit. Because it had been awhile since they\u2019d seen each other, they decided to \u201csplurge\u201d and go to this really nice restaurant in the city adjacent our campus. When my roommate came home, she could not stop talking about how expensive everything was. She had a box with leftovers and said that she felt like she needed to bring it home because it cost so much that she didn\u2019t want to waste it. The next day, she asks me if I want her leftovers. I was surprised given all she had said about the cost, but I said sure that I would take it. She asked \u201care you sure?\u201d which I thought was weird at the time, but I said yes again, so she gave the box to me and I ate it all. \nA few hours later, I received a venmo request with the caption \u201cleftovers\u201d. I went to her room and asked why she was charging me for the leftovers she gave me. She said it was assumed because of all the conversation regarding the cost, and that she had even \u201cdouble checked\u201d with me (that\u2019s what \u201care you sure\u201d meant I guess). It was for half of what the dish cost because that\u2019s about how much she brought home. I was so annoyed and told her I wouldn\u2019t have taken it if I knew she was charging me, but she said I shouldn\u2019t have taken it if I didn\u2019t plan on paying her back for some of it considering I \u201cknew how expensive it was\u201d. I finally agreed to pay for half of what she requested just to get her off my back, but to this day she thinks I should have paid her what she requested and I think I shouldn\u2019t have at all. So please help us settle once and for all. AITA in this situation?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for the replies! We are still friends, this is probably one of the only times we\u2019ve majorly been on different pages. She does want me to include that part of her justification is that if I had gone to the restaurant and we decided there to split it that I would have paid for half, which is why she thought it was fair to ask for.", "created_utc": 1674662820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l26qr/aita_for_not_paying_my_roommate_for_her_leftovers/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because the restaurant included all of that in the original price.", "NTA.  She is delusional if she thinks asking you if you want it is the same as asking you if you want to pay for it.

That's really all there is to it!  Though I agree it's extremely strange for someone to want you to contribute money for leftovers -- I'd be as surprised as you are.

She never said anything about charging you money at the time and let you presume that she was giving you the food to have as a giftWhich is what most people do!!  \n\nYou need to explain to her those prices are also *restaurant* prices and not takeaway prices.  The experience of being in the restaurant, being served etc.  you didn\u2019t have that whole expertise.  You got left overs in a box from a manipulative friend who saw a way to recover her costs without telling you beforehand.    \n\n\nWhat happens if it is a pizza and she brought one home.
