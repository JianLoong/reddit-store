We\u2019re hoping this settles it once and for all.\n\nMy (22f at the time) college roommate (also 22f at the time) had a friend from her hometown visit. Because it had been awhile since they\u2019d seen each other, they decided to \u201csplurge\u201d and go to this really nice restaurant in the city adjacent our campus. When my roommate came home, she could not stop talking about how expensive everything was. She had a box with leftovers and said that she felt like she needed to bring it home because it cost so much that she didn\u2019t want to waste it. The next day, she asks me if I want her leftovers. I was surprised given all she had said about the cost, but I said sure that I would take it. She asked \u201care you sure?\u201d which I thought was weird at the time, but I said yes again, so she gave the box to me and I ate it all. \nA few hours later, I received a venmo request with the caption \u201cleftovers\u201d. I went to her room and asked why she was charging me for the leftovers she gave me. She said it was assumed because of all the conversation regarding the cost, and that she had even \u201cdouble checked\u201d with me (that\u2019s what \u201care you sure\u201d meant I guess). It was for half of what the dish cost because that\u2019s about how much she brought home. I was so annoyed and told her I wouldn\u2019t have taken it if I knew she was charging me, but she said I shouldn\u2019t have taken it if I didn\u2019t plan on paying her back for some of it considering I \u201cknew how expensive it was\u201d. I finally agreed to pay for half of what she requested just to get her off my back, but to this day she thinks I should have paid her what she requested and I think I shouldn\u2019t have at all. So please help us settle once and for all. AITA in this situation?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for the replies! We are still friends, this is probably one of the only times we\u2019ve majorly been on different pages. She does want me to include that part of her justification is that if I had gone to the restaurant and we decided there to split it that I would have paid for half, which is why she thought it was fair to ask for.\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you, Reddit, for serving as our mediator in this matter. I think shes finally accepted where I am/was coming from thanks to all of these replies. We actually had a really good convo that I won\u2019t go too into detail, but basically she was in a more complicated spot with finances then and was just approaching everything through that headspace, and we have never really had another money related thing come up so we never talked through it before in great depth. But now she finally admits that wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. I do think me paying even a portion of her request is probably why this has been in tension limbo for so long because it was like kind of agreeing with her request but not, so I\u2019ll own that part.", "created_utc": 1674662820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l26qr/aita_for_not_paying_my_roommate_for_her_leftovers/", "score": 750, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Once you drive that new car off the lot, the value of that car drops significantly compared to what you just paid 5 minutes ago.\n\nSO - even IF buying her leftovers was a thing people did, you wouldn't have owed her half the cost of the meal. I think you were more than generous in paying her anything, because personally, I think even if I had to take out a loan to do it, I would have bought a meal at the same restaurant (one of my choosing), eaten what I wanted (but leaving about the same amount of food) and then \"returned the purchase\" to her, since you couldn't agree on the price...\n\nedit to add -\n\nI'm currently eating my leftover chicken alfredo from last night, but I'll happily stop if anyone wants it.

As someone else noted, the original expense wasn't simply the cost of the food on the plate (even with markup) or even its preparation, it was the cost of that PLUS the dining experience, the plating, the ambience, the service, etc.  The half-eaten, cold leftovers in a box that she brought home weren't worth half of that, they were MAYBE worth a tiny fraction of the price. And at that point, asking for any money at all was inappropriate since she said herself that she really only brought it home because she hated the idea of wasting it . . . she didn't even particularly WANT those leftovers.

Also, who the heck makes anyone pay for *leftovers?!* \n\nGlad you managed to keep a friend, but uhhh... I'd be careful with that one!", "Just to be on record - the only exception to the \u201cleftovers are never better\u201d rule, is stew. Just gives all of the flavors more time to marinate and doesn\u2019t ruin textures/moistness", "\"How would you like your steak?\"\n\n\"Medium-rare, take a few bites out, throw it in the fridge for a day, then reheat it in the microwave.\"", "It's funny, but if the roommate snarfed it down uninvited and she was planning to eat it, I would have said they owed half the cost.  But since it was basically pushed upon her without repayment being mentioned (and doesn't sound like it was even wanted), then I'd say 1/4 of the cost would be fair.", "NTA. Before yku cbarge someone for someone, you tell them you have to pay for it. She made it sound like you didn't have to pay anything. Also, asking for half the price for leftovers, that are cold and at least one noght old, would also be too much. Also, in a restaurant, yku don't only pay for food, also for environment and all kind sof thing, ehich OP didnt get, shr ate thr ledtovers at her home, where she already pays dor rent and other bills.", "NTA your friend is small-minded and dumb.", "Nta she didn\u2019t ask if you want to buy it? She asked if you wanted it? It was a gift and she ripped you off", "Wtf. Definitely NTA. That girl is weird", "Doesn\u2019t matter what your financial situation is if I offer something to someone it comes without the expectation to be compensated for it. You are NTA but your friend is.", "Also the price of the food is for the ambiance as well which you don\u2019t get at home eating it out of a leftovers box", "This guides our eating/ordering out. Eat first what doesn\u2019t reheat well. Like you say, usually the salads and app are the the first to go. Then the entree goes into that fridge for lunch/dinner tomorrow.", "I win, because *French* ( more or less ).", "I concur."]}
