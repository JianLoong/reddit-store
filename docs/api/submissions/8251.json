When my roommate came home, she could not stop talking about how expensive everything was. She had a box with leftovers and said that she felt like she needed to bring it home because it cost so much that she didn\u2019t want to waste it. The next day, she asks me if I want her leftovers. I was surprised given all she had said about the cost, but I said sure that I would take it. She asked \u201care you sure?\u201d which I thought was weird at the time, but I said yes again, so she gave the box to me and I ate it all. \nA few hours later, I received a venmo request with the caption \u201cleftovers\u201d.

It was for half of what the dish cost because that\u2019s about how much she brought home.

As someone else noted, the original expense wasn't simply the cost of the food on the plate (even with markup) or even its preparation, it was the cost of that PLUS the dining experience, the plating, the ambience, the service, etc.  The half-eaten, cold leftovers in a box that she brought home weren't worth half of that, they were MAYBE worth a tiny fraction of the price.

I bet she sells ten year old clothes on the internet.", "NTA. \u201cHey you want my leftovers\u201d does not, and has never meant, \u201chey you wanna BUY my leftovers\u201d, and your friend knows it. She played the entire scenario in a specific way so she could argue that you knew she wanted money, where no reasonable person would EVER expect to pay for leftovers.", "NTA. It\u2019s nice y\u2019all are still close but your friend needs more human socialization because that\u2019s not how offering someone leftovers works. At all. If having you pay half was always her intention, she needed to SAY that upfront instead of being squirrelly and waiting until after you\u2019d eaten to send the venmo request. Like, I would\u2019ve died on that hill before paying her because the way she went about it was shady and defies basic etiquette/norms. \n\nAnd to address your edit: there is a **major** difference between splitting a meal at a restaurant and sharing the cost vs. having someone pay half for leftovers. 1) Your food would\u2019ve been hot/fresh/presumably *worth* half the price if you\u2019d been there instead of half-eaten and reheated and 2) you would\u2019ve *discussed* sharing the cost instead of having it sprung on you without warning. There\u2019s no reasonable justification for what she did, which is why she\u2019s the clear AH in this situation.", "NTA Sounds like a plan to recoup her dining expenses.", "NTA she overspent and thought you were an easy mark to manipulate.", "NTA. This is so weird. Who in the world charges for leftovers lol", "Get this person out of your life, they suck", "NTA. No one in their right mind would assume when being offered leftovers that they would be charged for them. \n\nAlso, if you offer someone something, it's your obligation to make it clear that you expect payment - no matter how petty you're being by asking for payment. \n\nIt seems to me that she was trying to trick you into subsidizing her splurge and that's crappy for a \"friend\" to do. And the fact that she's still arguing about it tells me she hasn't grown up or gotten kinder. \n\nNTA. Feel free to show her this thread too.", "NTA\n\nNot sure where the people on Reddit find their \u201cfriends\u201d.  This is utterly ridiculous.  I would have thrown it up and gave it back to her.", "NTA. The menu price includes service, ambiance, and the food being served fresh and hot. You received none of those things. You received someone's day old, half-eaten, cold leftovers in your own apartment. Why would that be worth full proportional price.\n\nIf she expected payment, she should have communicated it in advance. She did it the way she did to try to guilt you into covering part of the cost of her lavish dinner. I would've told her to pound sand.", "NTA\nSure, she can come up with a situation where what she did was reasonable, but that's not the situation you are in. She's wrong in this situation, and quite frankly you should have told her to pound sand.", "She didn't say that, because she knew very well that charging for leftovers is ridiculous.  OP would have laughed at her.  Even at 5% of the original cost, it's absurd.  \n\nApparently, she's so cheap that she decided tricking her roommate into buying her leftovers was the best course of action.", "And even if you're going to, you make it clear up front, rather than just \"hey you want it?\" and then sending a request after", "Yep. More than half the reason for going to a fancy restaurant is for the atmosphere. The food cost is a reflection of location as much as food quality.\n\nIf you don't get the restaurant experience you shouldn't have to pay restaurant costs. (Not true of fast casual obviously \ud83e\udd23)", "**NTA**\n\nIf it were me, I would have made that point abundantly clear by actually being an asshole.", "Also, I think it's important to note that the roommate literally said she felt like she had to take the leftovers home because it was so expensive and she didn't want it to go to waste.\n\nThere is absolutely no way it's a mere coincidence that she intentionally made OP think she was just politely offering her leftovers, and simply forgot the whole part about wanting money for the leftovers (which she didn't even really want) until after OP ate them.\n\nIt was a scam, basically. The roommate knew exactly what she was doing, she just wanted to recoup some of what she spent on dinner.", "To request the same price for one day old leftovers on whoch the friend already nibbled on as for a fresh meal in the restaurant is just brazen. And the way she asked without speaking of payment, as if she planned it. She overspend herself and tried to get some money back with her old food by being tricky. And some people would have just paid because \"maybe i really misunderstoid\" and \"i don't want the conflict\"\n\nNTA", "#NTA\n \nYour friend is cheap. You don\u2019t charge someone for old food, no matter how \u201cfancy\u201d or \u201cexpensive\u201d it is.", "And to make it worse she didn\u2019t even have the nerve to ask her to her face she did it over a Venmo request", "It was not a misunderstanding.  She tricked the OP into buying her leftovers.  The OP rightly presumed (as every human on the planet would) that his roommate didn't want the leftovers herself but also didn't want them to go to waste.", "The name of the store: *Le Trashe Panda*", "Not a scavenger, but a leftover connoisseur.", "> We are still friends\n\nBecause they're still friends, it seems there's no suggestion the roommate is being disingenuous.   I agree it's strange, I agree it's bad, but that doesn't mean she was tricking the OP, and maybe this is when she learned you don't charge people for your leftovers.  We all make social mistakes when we're young.", ">I finally agreed to pay for half of what she requested just to get her off my back, **but to this day she thinks I should have paid her what she requested** and I think I shouldn\u2019t have at all.\n\nIf she had learned anything, she'd make up for the social mistake and buy the OP dinner.  Instead, she doubled down on her lunacy.", "Well, let's hope the two of them read through this Trial By Internet Jury, have a laugh and put it behind them.  It's 100% NTA and incredulity she asked for the money."]}
