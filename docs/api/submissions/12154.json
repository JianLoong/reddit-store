After about five minutes of rambling, he says his friends left him somewhere and he needed a ride home. He was barely coherent and couldn't even tell me where he was, and I was tired and pissed off, so I told him he needed to find his friends and figure it out and I went back to sleep.\nI don't know when he ended up getting home, he was asleep on the couch when I left. \nSince then he's been short and distant, obviously still upset over it. He didn't tell me about what happened and has slept in the living room since. Gets testy if I even ask.\n\nMaybe it was mean not to go get him, but he's an adult and it shouldn't be my responsibility if he gets too drunk and wonders off somewhere. I want to mention his friends were driving, so I wasn't forcing him to drive home drunk. I figured if he'd really been in trouble, he'd have mentioned it or called back. I didn't think it was that big of a deal, but almost a week later he's still upset.

Yeah he was shit faced and should be more responsible for his drinking. And you'd been in your right to scold him when he was sober.

As far as you knew, his friends were getting him home OR he wasn't going to drink so much that he couldn't get home on his own (uber/taxi etc).\n\nThe fact that he's still butt hurt about a week later makes me wonder if he often blames others for his mistakes.", "YTA \n\u201cHe does this fine all the time\u201d so this is out of the norm for him.

Do better.", "Totally YTA.\n\nSo what if he got too drunk. He became stranded (not because he was drunk, because his ride bailed) and needed you, *his wife*, to help him. \n\nMistakes happen, you're both supposed to help each other when they do.

Is that what you're saying? Unless he pulls this a lot YTA", "YTA so much! Who cares if he fucked up? That\u2019s separate and you two can hash that out later ONCE HE IS HOME SAFE.

Yes you're allowed to be annoyed and upset. But your husband asked for your help and you didn't seem to care. Partners are supposed to be there for each other.

No way could I just go back to sleep. I'd be freaking out until I found him and made sure he was ok. You sound heartless\n\nYTA", "YTA unless this happens often. It\u2019s one thing if he happened to be in a tough spot and was counting on his spouse to be there for him, but it\u2019s a totally different story if he purposely goes out with no plan of getting home safe because he knows you will come pick him up if he asks.", "YTA - Someone you love and are committed to, called you when they believe they needed help and you left them. You are a huge asshole. Its alright to be mad, but you just majorly violated his trust in you, and his view of you as a partner.\n\nFor someone to reach out to someone when they need help, and to have it turned down, is one of the worst feelings. You're also his wife.\n\nYou said he was totally smashed, how can you then also rationalize that he would have been cognizant to call back and ask for help. What if that was his only chance or opportunity before something had happened. If someone is that smashed that they're slurring, and calling for help, maybe they need HELP\n\nThe fact you say he goes out and gets himself home just fine the rest of the time should add to your worries too, not be used as your justification. It's outside the norm for him to call and ask for help, he probably NEEDED it. If he isn't coherent enough to even tell where he is, he was dangerously drunk.\n\n11pm is also not ridiculously late even if you have a morning shift.", "YTA, just try to think for a while how would you feel if he had done the same to you?\nYou are a couple, you should be able to rely on each other when you need it.. plus you can really know if his other friends were also drunk..that man deserves an apology.", "Massive YTA. I can only imagine how pissed off you\u2019d be were the tables reversed.", "Yikes. If roles were reversed you\u2019d probably file for divorce. Your spouse needed u and u didn\u2019t come through.

I would never leave my spouse abandoned somewhere unknown let alone drunk.", "Sorry but YTA.\n\nTake the call, pick him up, and THEN be mad at him.", "YTA. If he was that incoherent then how would he know to tell you he\u2019s in trouble or to call back. Is it kind of dumb that they split up and got super wasted, yeah of course. Does that give you the right to completely not give a shit and risk his safety, absolutely not. You either reach out to his friends (since they were driving I\u2019d assume at least one of them were sober) you figure out what\u2019s going on and if he needs to be picked up then you do so. You can ring him a new one in the morning and discuss how to avoid these situations but hey that\u2019s life and you showed him he can\u2019t trust you when shit happens.", "NTA.  He can take a cab home.", "NTA. He's an adult and if he can't figure out how to get home on his own after getting plastered, it's not your problem. Since he was, in fact, home the next morning, I'm assuming that even in his incapacitation he was able to figure something out on his own. After all, we do have such modern conveniences as Uber, Lyft, and taxi cabs.\n\nMy parents very rarely drink, and never to that level of drunkenness. But when my dad was younger he'd sometimes go to the pool hall with his buddies and get a little bent out of shape. When that happened he knew better than to call my mom, and he did sleep it off on the couch. Hubby is being a big baby because you weren't at his beck and call after he got himself into the situation to begin with. No one strapped his arms and legs down and poured the drinks down his throat, after all.", "YTA. There was a night before I lived with my partner where he got very drunk and ended up wandering around the city and got lost. We weren't even supposed to hang out that night, he was with friends and just got disoriented on his walk home (normally a 20 min walk). I had been smoking weed so i couldn't drive to pick him up, but I stayed on the phone with him to help him figure out where he was and walked to find him. You look out for your partner even when it isn't conveniant. Even when theyre a man who isn't necessarily afraid of getting r*ped. Even when they annoy you. What if something had happened to him because you didn't pick him up? I'd rather be a little tired for work than realize my partner never made it home and was seriously hurt or died.", "YTA. You said he goes out regularly and is usually fine. So this is unusual behavior. This time he got shitfaced and literally called you for help. You decided to leave him stranded and incapacitated. Your life partner could not depend on you because you needed sleep. I can not imagine even being able to sleep knowing my husband is stranded somewhere and not able to take care of himself. I would absolutely, and begrudgingly, get out of bed and go find my idiot husband and then get him home and safely in bed. Then berate him in the morning. Do you even like your husband?", "Jfc how could you type all that out and not be the AH. Your partner could barely speak. What if he passed out somewhere unsafe or was robbed while incapacitated? Idek what else to say other than what an awful way to treat your spouse. YTA", "ESH \n\nHe sucks for getting so drunk he could not take care of himself. Irresponsible. \n\nYou suck worse.  Way worse.  He made a mistake.  You announced you DGAF if your husband lives or dies with your behavior.  If you loved him, get him home safe.  Have a serious discussion/rip him a new AH when he sobers up.\n\nHow the hell did you even sleep?", "You don't understand what love actually is, and your husband deserves better. If my wife was drunk, in a strange place, and needed help, of course I'd go get her. I can't believe I'm actually reading this shit. Lol", "YTA\n\nHow can you care so little for his safety?", "YTA\n\nBe pissed all you want. Prep for the most scathing teardown for when he's sober. But do not leave your husband stranded drunk. That's how really awful things happen. Really awful. \n\n> I figured if he'd really been in trouble, he'd have mentioned it or called back.\n\nYes, because drunk people are masters of logical thought.", "Sounds like the first time he's asked you for a ride in a tight spot and because of this it should be his last , holy shit! He could've gotten drugged or mugged in that state. You couldve picked him up and been annoyed but at least known he was safe, and then told him not to get trashed on a weeknight in the future- would've been clear communication while not being cold. Instead he figured out how to get home in some kind of duress, you honestly have no clue how he got home? You don't care how? \n\nYTA, if you're in a bad way you'd expect your husband to be there for you, that's what being a partner is!", "Unless he does this frequently, YTA.  He was alone and needed you.  Heck. Maybe he drank a roofied drink by accident and was a victim.", "YTA. I always had the rule if our kids were at a party and needed a ride they could call me and I would get them no question. I would rather them be safe, than ride with someone drunk. The same would go for my husband.  My husband has called me because he was too tired to drive home from work (he has worked 36 hours), I was just fine getting him. I would rather him be safe than drive home tired.", "YTA - \u201cThrough sickness and in health\u201d my ass, you didn\u2019t even care enough to get him home safely. If it were you in his position how would you feel?", "Yta. You don\u2019t sound like a good partner.", "ESH.  Your husband was wrong to go out and get drunk.  If he does this regularly then you need to perhaps reconsider your relationship unless he gets help with his drinking problem.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t sound like a recurring issue so I have to ask- do you even like your husband?  Would you care if he died? I mean, I know it is important to get a good nights sleep when you have to go to work the next day, but if my husband, a sibling, a good friend or even a passing acquaintance called me and told me they were drunk, had been abandon and had no way home, I\u2019d probably give up an hours sleep to make sure they didn\u2019t get, I don\u2019t know, hit by a car, rolled, robbed and beat up, passed out and died from exposure, found dead in a ditch, tried to drive themselves and hit someone with the car, gone off with some other woman who promised him a ride home.  \n\nAnd the fact you were able to roll back over and go to sleep and not give him a second thought, is impressive.\n\nI get why he is giving you the cold shoulder.  He now understands exactly how much you care for him.", "Are you seriously asking if YTA? Because YTA. Your spouse who depends on you called for help. It is literally your role in life to help each other for better or worse. It doesn\u2019t sound like this is something that has occurred before, correct? You\u2019re seriously not a good spouse.", "YTA, for just leaving him stranded and not giving a damn about him.", "YTA. If your husband did this to you, Im sure you would be pissed as well. I say this as a woman: men can absolutely be attacked and assaulted.\n\nA sophomore guy on my college campus got abducted, robbed, beaten, and dropped off in the middle of nowhere in my state. He had to walk two hours to the nearest house, in the dead of night, with God only knows what kind of injuries, to find a house, and beg for help. \n\nThat could have been your husband. Your anger is directed at the wrong person. Blame his terrible friends for abandoning him.", "YTA. His friends were supposed to bring him home and they abandoned him.

You're a shitty partner and I really hope you don't have kids.", "NTA NTA NTA", "ESH- him for drinking and it sounds pretty regular. He needs help. You suck because you seem indifferent.

Also I don't know why you're assuming his friends ditched him. They probably just got separated or he just didn't want to go to the next bar if they were hopping.

The person that you promised you would never abandon. You abandoned him. That\u2019s strike one. \n\nYour husband drank over his limit. That is certainly his fault. We are all responsible for our drinking habits and ability to drink and likewise restraining ourselves from drinking too much. However, as you pointed out *he was not the designated driver.* So he made the informed decision he could get shit faced and go home. Maybe not the best decision, but once you\u2019re drunk, you simply cannot \u201cundrunk\u201d yourself. \n\nNow, with all that established, I\u2019m not sure where you are but most places in the United States are still incredibly cold at the moment and alcohol does not help with that. Even being drunk worsens your condition. You left a man reaching out for help incapacitated, barely coherent, and alone forgoing the fact he was in need to assistance and went to bed. Work tomorrow or not, depending on where he was, they could have been in or ended up in life threatening danger. You did not display care for their safety or sense of urgency.

You prioritise your sleep (which is free btw) over the physical safety of your husband and that is strike three. \n\nIt all adds up to the predicament you\u2019re currently in. Broken trust. Trust is hard to build up and it only takes one time to shatter it. It doesn\u2019t matter when you break that trust or how you do so, once it\u2019s gone you cannot simply replace it.

All these people saying if roles were reversed she would expect him to get her. You are all assuming she goes out and gets blind drunk. Lots of people never do that because it is stupid and unsafe and part of maturing as an adult is realising this and knowing your limits. And comparing it to a kid in the same situation is ridiculous. Kids are kids and they will do stupid things from time to time, and when you first start drinking you don\u2019t know your limits. We are talking about an adult man who should know better.

But, OP could have done it the old fashion way and told him to hand the phone to someone so she could ask where he was, go pick him up, and make sure he\u2019s safe at home. \n\nNot saying she shouldn\u2019t be cheesed off with his behavior and give him and earful later (if deserved, he could have been in an actually dangerous situation. In which case, maybe some empathy from OP is needed).", "My children , age 46 and 48, plus my 5 grandkids are all on a \u201cfind my friends \u201c. We don\u2019t stalk each other. Just look to see if their home before i call, or  if they are on a blind date etc. No one complains and no one is obligated to be on it", "I\u2019m with you on this one. I find the whole concept so creepy and invasive.", "No we don't either.  The only people that I know that actually does is my sister that my husband gave me children!", "Me neither.  In a pinch I can find my minor children this way I suppose since I have their phones on parental controls, but the only time I've used it is when their devices were lost.  I certainly don't have my husband on a tracker.", "Here here", "You can share locations on google maps too.\n\nit might not be as accurate of a location but it is good to have some sort of \"last location spotted\".", "How come I hadn\u2019t thought of this?", "Sure. He fucked up. He thought he could depend on his friends to drive him home, and they ditched him. He shouldn\u2019t have drank so much.\n\nBut she could have easily picked him up first and berated him all she wants after that. She didn\u2019t even care to get him to safety. when she married him, she vowed to be with him in health and sickness. As her husband and as the person she loves and cares for, he should be able to rely on her. He was alone, helpless, and abandoned and called her for help. \n\nInstead, she showed that he can\u2019t rely on her. Not only that, she showed that she doesn\u2019t care for him at all. He was in danger all by himself and she went to sleep without batting an eye. That\u2019s a betrayal, and a dealbreaker. She failed as a wife.", "Imagine that OP's husbands friends did actually ditch him in mean spirits.\n\nThe guy wakes up the next day to realize not only are his friends shit, his wife was content to leave him without an oar.", "Lol I\u2019m pretty sure you missed the sarcasm.", "Lmao, this was a one-time occurrence (from how op mentions it) shit happens. If you can't count on your S.O. for help. Then...I dont know what to say. This isn't about \"taking responsibility.\"This is about reaching out when you *know* you need help, and there is nothing wrong with that.\n\nIt's sad that you can't even see that. He messed up this once and asked for help. That's it. She shoved it back in his face.", "Right. So tired of that narrative. Reddit has proved time and time again to call out AH behavior no matter the gender", "She could have tried to find out. Call his friends? Ask him to put someone else on the phone?\n\nBut she said figure it out yourself and went to sleep.", "Not me. My parents were controlling, overly nosy, violated boundaries and had zero sense of me having any privacy growing up. The kind to take my bedroom door off the hinges and leave it off for months (with no curtain or any other kind of opaque barrier) while going through puberty because I didn\u2019t like my golden child younger sister barging in for no reason than to take my stuff and just hang out in my room. \n\nI have never and will never turn on that function for anyone to the extent I can help it.", "I\u2019m a woman and I don\u2019t. I find it creepy and controlling.", "Yes, and I share when I travel.", "Last two areas I  have lived in have been very safe. Also privacy concerns (my crowd is older and generally quite tech-aware). There's also an element of independence, that kids should be given free reign to develop responsibility.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that I'm not based in the US, which seems to be considerably more fraught with problems than some other Western societies.\n\nWe've got an AirTag for our kid's schoolbag, but that was just to check where the bus was on the route home.", "Wow, if ever my parents made me wear something like that we would have learned how ling these last in a bonfire we used to make in the woods when I was in primary school and probably would have tried to emancipate my ass pronto.\n\nWtf", "Thank you! Because it is! \ud83d\ude02 I mean I definitely let my husband know where I'll be but neither of us feel the need or that's it appropriate to be tracking one another.", "Wow.  This seems to have struck a nerve with you. I will just say I don't think she's \"failed as a wife,\" or betrayed anyone. I disagree with almost everything in your second two paragraphs. I'llleave you alone now to take some deep, calming breaths.", "Honestly, theres some difference in some cases, but it seems less a consistent pattern and more based on who answered first, what time of day the post was made, who it was popular for first etc.", "I share it with people in my household because it\u2019s always picking up/dropping off, etc. Just easier than the \u201cwhere are you\u201d texts we always had flying around.", "I\u2019d say it depends on the situation. My husband and I share our locations with each other, but not so we can check on each other\u2019s whereabouts routinely because we totally trust each other. It\u2019s only for emergencies. \n\nFor example, a friend of ours had a heart attack while he was out running, He did not have this activated and was found unconscious and take to a hospital as a John Doe since he didn\u2019t have any ID or emergency contacts on his phone. \n\nEventually his wife noticed that he hadn\u2019t returned from the run, called police and after a while, he was located. By then, he\u2019d undergone emergency surgery with no one there to provide his medical history or talk to the doctors about treatment options. Luckily he survived, but I think this is a good example of why location sharing can be a good thing. Our friend had no history of heart or other health problems.", "Haha yeah I\u2019m with u. I do t share my location with anyone have never done it with my kids either", "Same here. I remember the first time my husband showed me all his fiends locations on Snapchat and I was just like\u2026.WHY? It would creep me out knowing friends and family were just\u2026.keeping random tabs on where I was. \n\nYa wanna know where I am? Maybe hit me up and, ya know, ask.", "It\u2019s creepy and controlling to share your location with someone you love and trust? Like\u2026 maybe you\u2019re not in healthy relationships? \n\nPlease unpack that with a qualified professional.", "I only turn location on for apps when I specifically need it.", "I don't either", "These things are on their phones nowadays and they aren\u2019t ditching their phones.", "We\u2019re talking about adults. My spouse and I share location data because it\u2019s 1) free and 2) let\u2019s us find lost phones. If you\u2019re not in an abusive relationship it isn\u2019t that weird\u2014we know where each other are anyway 90% of the time.", "where i live it's important becuase you can be easily kidnapped or bad shit", ">My husband went out with a few friends of his friends, **which he does just fine all the time**.\n\nShe stated that he has gone out with his friends before and everything always worked out fine. \n\nEven if this wasn't the first time it happened she still could've picked him up then grilled him about it when he's sobered up. If it was her and it wasn't the first time she did it I'm sure you'd still want her husband to pick her up then have a serious talk with her or would you prefer he left her out there cause *she needs to work on being an adult*?\n\nOr is it because he's a man you think nothing would have happened to him? Cause I'm sure no one would want a woman to be drunk and left stranded out by herself especially at night", "You disagree that a husband should be able to rely on his wife?", "I just listened to a podcast about a woman who spent 8 days upside down in her car in a ditch. The police were busy questioning her husband suspecting foul play.  Sharing a location definitely would have had her found sooner.", ">Ya wanna know where I am? Maybe hit me up and, ya know, ask.\n\nExactly!  I don't why does anyone need to know your exact location 24/7?\n\nAnd they call me paranoid because I carry concealed.", "Easy there tiger. Different strokes for different folks and all that. \n\nEach relationship works differently, and just because some of us don\u2019t like this concept doesn\u2019t mean our relationships are unhealthy and therapy is needed ASAP.", "I share my location with them verbally.  Try putting your phone down and actually communicating.", "I've had friends whose parents insisted on location sharing. Those phones absolutely got ditched regularly. All you need is a burner phone and call forwarding and problem solved", "Id factory reset mine as fuck", "I am sorry that you live in that kind of fear.  Maybe take some self-defense classes.", "I'm sorry that you have to live like that", "Exactly. Some people want to share their locations in case of an emergency. They aren\u2019t creepy or controlling.\n\nThis kind of projection should definitely be unpacked.", "You\u2019re being willfully obtuse, as if there aren\u2019t emergency scenarios where your partner having your location via Find My isn\u2019t an additional safety feature. I get it, you\u2019re not like other girls.", "But the conversation is about emergency situations or being too drunk to know where you are, not just regular life things. Sharing locations in that situation is helpful.\n\nAlso phones are a means to communicate. So no putting the phone down to \u201cactually communicate,\u201d makes no sense in this situation or honestly ever.", "And then those parents will wonder why their kids cut them off from their lives.\n\nMaybe im a child of the 80s but fuck bad parenting that reads like house arrest. Yikes", "No I most definitely am not.  I don't depend on my husband to take care of me and if I am in such a situation that I need for him to be able to locate me with my phone then I am already dead and probably at that point in time my phone is no longer with me.\n\nHaving someone tracking you at all times is for what?  How does that help you?", ">But the conversation is about emergency situations or being too drunk to know where you are\n\nDon't get too drunk to know where you are and if plan to do so at least be sober enough to tell someone where you need to go.\n\nDon't put yourself in these kinds of situation where you need someone to be able to track you on your phone to come and get you."]}
