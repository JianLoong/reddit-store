I've since moved back out.\n\nMy sister was upset that I moved back home and basically treated me like shit the whole time. She would constantly leave a mess everywhere and demand that I clean it, she would go into my bedroom and steal my belongings any time I wasn't there (and not even just when I wasn't home, she would even go in there while I was in the shower or taking out the garbage or something), she would criticize absolutely everything I did... just overall being very disrespectful towards my space, belongings, and me as a person, and it was all completely intentional. I know this because I said to her once \"it's almost as if you're trying to make my life miserable so that I'll leave\" and she said \"I am.\" So I'm not exaggerating here. My parents did absolutely nothing about it except tell me it was a phase and she'd get over it. I got several different locks for my bedroom door and furniture and my sister picked all of them, so that didn't make a difference either.\n\nAs ridiculous as it sounds for a teenager's behavior to affect me this much, it really started to get to me after a while. During what was already a period of uncertainty for everyone, I also had to deal with knowing that any time I wasn't in my bedroom, my space would be invaded. It got to a point where I would have anxiety attacks at the thought of leaving my room because of that loss of control associated with it. I stopped applying for jobs because I knew that if I went to work my sister would do who-knows-what to my space. It's one of the reasons (although definitely not the only one) I decided to move back out despite not really being able to afford it. I just couldn't handle being around my sister anymore.\n\nFast forward to now and according to my parents, my sister has gone off the rails. She's been refusing to go to school for months and is failing all her classes, she's staying out until like 3 am every night and coming home under the influence of something (neither my parents nor I know enough about drugs to know what it is and she won't say), and in general is clearly going through something. The stealing has also continued - every time I go visit my parents she takes something from my bag, usually money.\n\nMy mom called me the other day and asked me to have a mental health discussion with my sister, seeing as I had issues when I was younger as well (albeit totally different ones) and she thought maybe I could help. I said no before she even finished her sentence. She asked why and I basically told her \"because my mental health suffered for over a year ***because of her*** and you did nothing about it. And only now that her behavior affects ***you*** do you want my help? No. Take her to a psychiatrist like you should have done a year ago.\" My mom is mad at me now and thinks I'm being selfish.
