{"id": 21045, "submission_id": "14nstfg", "title": "AITA for not wanting to talk to my sister about mental health?", "selftext": "I (26F) have been mostly living independently since the age of 18, however during COVID I temporarily moved back in with my parents and my sister (16F). I've since moved back out.\n\nMy sister was upset that I moved back home and basically treated me like shit the whole time. She would constantly leave a mess everywhere and demand that I clean it, she would go into my bedroom and steal my belongings any time I wasn't there (and not even just when I wasn't home, she would even go in there while I was in the shower or taking out the garbage or something), she would criticize absolutely everything I did... just overall being very disrespectful towards my space, belongings, and me as a person, and it was all completely intentional. I know this because I said to her once \"it's almost as if you're trying to make my life miserable so that I'll leave\" and she said \"I am.\" So I'm not exaggerating here. My parents did absolutely nothing about it except tell me it was a phase and she'd get over it. I got several different locks for my bedroom door and furniture and my sister picked all of them, so that didn't make a difference either.\n\nAs ridiculous as it sounds for a teenager's behavior to affect me this much, it really started to get to me after a while. During what was already a period of uncertainty for everyone, I also had to deal with knowing that any time I wasn't in my bedroom, my space would be invaded. It got to a point where I would have anxiety attacks at the thought of leaving my room because of that loss of control associated with it. I stopped applying for jobs because I knew that if I went to work my sister would do who-knows-what to my space. It's one of the reasons (although definitely not the only one) I decided to move back out despite not really being able to afford it. I just couldn't handle being around my sister anymore.\n\nFast forward to now and according to my parents, my sister has gone off the rails. She's been refusing to go to school for months and is failing all her classes, she's staying out until like 3 am every night and coming home under the influence of something (neither my parents nor I know enough about drugs to know what it is and she won't say), and in general is clearly going through something. The stealing has also continued - every time I go visit my parents she takes something from my bag, usually money.\n\nMy mom called me the other day and asked me to have a mental health discussion with my sister, seeing as I had issues when I was younger as well (albeit totally different ones) and she thought maybe I could help. I said no before she even finished her sentence. She asked why and I basically told her \"because my mental health suffered for over a year ***because of her*** and you did nothing about it. And only now that her behavior affects ***you*** do you want my help? No. Take her to a psychiatrist like you should have done a year ago.\" My mom is mad at me now and thinks I'm being selfish.

She stole and trashed my stuff, and parents didn't intervene. One point she got severly bulimic, stopped going to school, and locked herself in. Not long after she dissapeared for days and got addicted to heroin. It was a hell for our family. It broke us apart and we have not recovered. \n\nMy message to you is to not let your parents blame you for what they failed to do. None of this is your fault.\nMy parents liked to blame us for their setbacks in life. It exacerbated my twins mental illness. \n\nYou don't write much about your parents. But know they are at the core of what is going on. Because they are emotionally immature. If you can get out, please do so asap.

I applaud you for not doing anything stupid in retaliation, because I know I  wouldn't have been that strong. I don't blame you at all for not wanting to help her. I don't see how your mother can't see that helping someone who hurt you is never going to work. maybe she doesn't know the extent to which your sister's actions made you anguished. and if she does then she's just desperate for free help. I am sorry either way. I hope you get the help you need and for everyone's sake I hope your sister does too, but it's not your responsibility. don't forget that.", "Absolutely not the AH!! I'm sorry you went through that. It is not your responsibility to take care of your sister's mental health, it is the responsibility of your negligent parents! I would honestly think about going low/no contact with them. I wish you the best of luck from onwards!", "NTA. She's their child, not yours. If they can't handle the situation, there's no rational logic that says you can. \n\n>Take her to a psychiatrist like you should have done a year ago.\"\n\nKeep repeating this until it actually happens.", "NTA\n\nYou could be the \"better person\" (whatever that means\" but I doubt your sister would suddenly open up to you after her campaign of bullying.\n\nYou could also tell them all to get lost.\n\n> Take her to a psychiatrist like you should have done a year ago.\n\nSeems like practical and rational advice. If the objection is \"but the cost\" then they can always report her variousd crimes to the police and put the problem in the hands of the state. That should work out just great...", "NTA. Your vindictive tone hides that, probably, you are factually and/or professionally correct. You may be being selfish for not even trying; but your parents are being na\u00efve. Your sister needs help that is beyond your and their ability to provide. Your parents are expecting (hoping that) you can accomplish something that, given how you and she do not have a positive relationship, is beyond your ability to do: somehow change your sister's pattern of behaviors.  \n\nWhether or not your sister's behaviors are due to her having temporary mental health challenges or due to something more serious only a qualified professional should attempt to diagnose and/or to treat.

When your younger daughter was treating OP as a maid and stealing from them?   \n\nMom is the one being selfish by not protecting her daughters (both of them) by being an actual adult and a parent and making hard parenting decisions by, for example, getting your child professional help, protecting your child\u2019s privacy, mental health and possessions, believing your child\u2019s concerns about her sibling and not trying to (still) make someone else do the uncomfortable work!

This is NOT your problem and they are trying to put it on you."]}
