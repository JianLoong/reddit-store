After seeing him for a few weeks, I invited Larry over for Easter dinner to join my mother who had come in town for the holiday, my friend Lucy, and me. Now, a few months earlier, I had caught an episode on the news show 20/20 reporting that most people cannot tell the difference betweena top-shelf vodka and mid-point vodka, particularly if mixed with something else. It just so happens that I had a bottle of Belvedere and when I finished it, as a joke, I kept the bottle and filled it with Smirnoff, which is not considered top-shelf in the U.S. but is a very good vodka. Easter arrived, I served a delicious dinner, and we had a really nice time. In fact, both Lucy and Larry stayed all day. During our conversation, the 20/20 episode came up and I mentioned that I had a bottle of Belvedere in the freezer (not disclosing that it was Smirnoff.) Really didn't think anything would come of it since we were consuming wine. A little while later, Larry said, \"hey, may I try a bit of the Belvedere?\" I said \"of course!\" and then just poured him about an ounce. He sipped it and I asked him, \"so, what do you think?\" \"Pretty good!\"   \nLater after he left, I gave Mom and Lucy the story, and Lucy just laughed, but my mother gasped, \"YOU CAN NEVER TELL HIM!\"  \nThe relationship didn't last beyond summer and he remained ignorant to the end about the difference between Smirnoff and Belvedere.", "NTA\n\nThis is the kind of funny prank you pull on your kids and laugh about it later.
