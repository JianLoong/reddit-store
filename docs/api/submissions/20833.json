Now, a few months earlier, I had caught an episode on the news show 20/20 reporting that most people cannot tell the difference betweena top-shelf vodka and mid-point vodka, particularly if mixed with something else. It just so happens that I had a bottle of Belvedere and when I finished it, as a joke, I kept the bottle and filled it with Smirnoff, which is not considered top-shelf in the U.S. but is a very good vodka. Easter arrived, I served a delicious dinner, and we had a really nice time. In fact, both Lucy and Larry stayed all day. During our conversation, the 20/20 episode came up and I mentioned that I had a bottle of Belvedere in the freezer (not disclosing that it was Smirnoff.) Really didn't think anything would come of it since we were consuming wine. A little while later, Larry said, \"hey, may I try a bit of the Belvedere?\" I said \"of course!\" and then just poured him about an ounce. He sipped it and I asked him, \"so, what do you think?\" \"Pretty good!\"   \nLater after he left, I gave Mom and Lucy the story, and Lucy just laughed, but my mother gasped, \"YOU CAN NEVER TELL HIM!\"  \nThe relationship didn't last beyond summer and he remained ignorant to the end about the difference between Smirnoff and Belvedere.", "NTA\n\nThis is the kind of funny prank you pull on your kids and laugh about it later.

Grandpa raised goats and there was always a goat version of every meat and dairy product in the fridge. Well, I made friends with the goats, named them all, had faves, told them my problems, etc.. I tried goat meat once early on- it was kind of gamey, NOT delicious, and obviously different. I can still taste it today. So, I refused to even use the butter, and grandma would always use grocery store meat when I was home. I learned to cook from being in the kitchen with her to make SURE we were eating store meat. I don't remember how she slipped it by one night, but I knew in the very first bite. I started bawling and they thought it was hilarious. Idk if a candy would do the same thing, but I really did have issues trusting them after that. Maybe that's WHY I started making sure I was in the kitchen? Idk, I'm just saying that little lies/ trickery that seems funny to adults really can impact a child in a serious way.", "INFO\n\n> the incident from 5 years ago.\n\nBut what's the recent conflict you want us to make a judgment about?", "slight YTA not for buying the Costco version but for being dishonest about it.", "ESH.
