Now, a few months earlier, I had caught an episode on the news show 20/20 reporting that most people cannot tell the difference betweena top-shelf vodka and mid-point vodka, particularly if mixed with something else. It just so happens that I had a bottle of Belvedere and when I finished it, as a joke, I kept the bottle and filled it with Smirnoff, which is not considered top-shelf in the U.S. but is a very good vodka. Easter arrived, I served a delicious dinner, and we had a really nice time. In fact, both Lucy and Larry stayed all day. During our conversation, the 20/20 episode came up and I mentioned that I had a bottle of Belvedere in the freezer (not disclosing that it was Smirnoff.) Really didn't think anything would come of it since we were consuming wine. A little while later, Larry said, \"hey, may I try a bit of the Belvedere?\" I said \"of course!\" and then just poured him about an ounce. He sipped it and I asked him, \"so, what do you think?\" \"Pretty good!\"   \nLater after he left, I gave Mom and Lucy the story, and Lucy just laughed, but my mother gasped, \"YOU CAN NEVER TELL HIM!\"  \nThe relationship didn't last beyond summer and he remained ignorant to the end about the difference between Smirnoff and Belvedere.", "NTA\n\nThis is the kind of funny prank you pull on your kids and laugh about it later.

He failed the test.\n\nWhen I was a kid, we always bought a particular brand of powdered sauce, you mix it with milk / water and add butter, presto, sauce. I preferred this brand. My dad didn't care or often forgot to buy that brand, fine, whatever, but he claimed that I couldn't tell the difference. So one time we were having dinner and I said \"but this is brand X that I don't like, why didn't we buy brand Y instead?\"\n\nHe then said \"it is brand Y, you can't tell the difference.\"\n\nI then went to the garbage and pulled out the container of brand X since I knew that **I could tell the difference.**\n\nYour son didn't notice, so he failed the test and if he can't learn or figure out what is going on, well, that's on him.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Though you could have simply said \"If you want to spend your pocket money on expensive toffee, you can.\" I think he's annoyed that he didn't realise and that you fooled him, rather than because of the toffee specifically.", "NTA. It's just a toffee prank, and Costco toffee is still yummy! Plus, teenage revenge is perfectly normal. \ud83d\ude04\ud83c\udf6c", "I mean it\u2019d be a pretty shitty ad. \u201cCome buy our expensive gourmet product! It tastes just like the cheap mass-produced stuff!\u201d", "He has not gotten over it five years later. Makes me think there is more of this kind of \"harmless\" behavior from mom we are not hearing about.", "So, you mean YTA right?", "Just a little emotional abuse for shits and giggles. Harmless, right?", "There are way better ways to teach this than being deliberately deceptive to entertain yourself though. This is the asshole's way.", "This fucking website. It\u2019s a completely benign joke. You\u2019d think she kicked him in the dick.", "Swine? If that\u2019s how you regard guests\u2026yikes.", "Exactly why I've been saying in my other comments it is emotional abuse. Sure it's not terrible as that scale goes but it does fit the pattern.", "There are two in my town, and both are packed no matter what time I go in!", "Cadbury has been utterly destroyed from when it was actually good though... Kraft bought it and now it's just sugar that tastes vaguely like chocolate.\n\nNow, the white chocolate Oreo Cadbury bar is GOAT but that's because it's cheap and plentiful. God I wish I could afford chocolate rn lol.", ">tricking them into being better people isn't being passive aggressive\n\nThat is actually a textbook passive-aggressive pattern. So is bringing it up again five years later just to poke fun at it, as the OP mentioned doing.\n\nI am happy for you that it didn't destroy your relationship with your mother, but it does destroy plenty of other relationships so I really hope for your kids' and grandkids' sakes that you find a way to break that cycle.", "I am partial to the dairy milk bar, personally, and usually the quality is great. I have noticed Cadbury Easter chocolates are not the same quality as the bar though. Every product seems to get worse over time as they find ways to produce it cheaper and faster. :(", "Textbook passive aggression is unrelated to getting someone to think or behave differently. Passive aggression is all about subtly doing/saying something for the purpose of irritating someone. Openly talking about it 5 years later isn't passive aggressive as OP was actively aggravating her son. \n\nEvery parent deceives their children. Parents all use different tricks to get them to do all sorts of things kids don't want to do. I'd bet my next mortgage payment that your parents have done at least of a few of these on you. So many many many social media accounts talk about these things and parents gobble them up. Many countries (including the US) teach teachers and parents these tricks in order to raise children that can better perform in their societies. I'm not saying to pull a prank a kid like OP did, that's up to the kind of relationship each parent has with their kid, but to act like a parent who deceives their child is an AH is a crazy statement because literally every parent who's ever tried to raise a happy, healthy, and well-adjusted person, has done this probably a few thousand times"]}
