My daughter is married with a 1.5 year old child.  She and her hubby got jobs in another city before the baby was born.  My spouse and I also retired 2 years before they had the baby.  We later bought a house in the same city that she and  her hubby relocated to (My daughter kept sending me \"for sale\" listings- I also asked her hubby if he was ok with us moving close to them) once they announced they were expecting/pregnant.  The house we bought is a 10 minute drive to their house.  We have now owned this house for 2.5 years. \n\nThen Covid happened so my daughter did not have the opportunity to get out in the community and meet people (She is very social).   I also bought the house to help her adjust to new motherhood while on mat leave, and offered the house to be used by her out-of-town friends and Son-in-law's family when we went on vacation or to our cottage. I also bought the house because my daughter said that she might not be able to get daycare until the baby was 18+ mo, and her hubby travelled for work, so I would be close by to help her.  \n\nDaughter has now returned to work, they got full time daycare, and her hubby no longer travels for work.  When her out of town friends/family visit they prefer to stay at their place.  My daughter and husband like the weekends for their family time (which I respect), so there will be very little need for me/us.  My daughter grew up in a multigenerational home (duplex) from age 8+, the grandparents on the main floor, myself, hubby and daughter on the upper floors unit.  So, she loved bouncing back and forth from our home to the grandparents. It was the old fashioned village, but there were challenges at times.\n\nI  worked full time for 44 years, and also looked after my parents during their declining years until they passed just before I retired.  Covid kept my hubby and I quite isolated during our first few years of retirement, but spending time with our daughter and SIL, helped us to not feel isolated.  My Son-in-law's father lives 4 hours away from them, and his mother lives in the US (a 14 hour drive) but they visit them a few times per year.\n\nI want to move to a city that will be 3 hours away from our daughter and her family, as we love that city/town vibe and it also has a large seniors population with an abundance of things for active seniors to do. My hubby wants to do this move too.   We would then come for frequent visits (when invited/needed) and stay in their home, just like her in-laws do, but my daughter thinks IATA for wanting to move away and not continue to be a village generation since they do not have any relatives living in the city they choose to live in.  I think my daughter feels rejected and that I am being selfish to move away from her, her hubby and the baby.

It doesn't always affect it negatively, but it always has an effect. Of course it does.

All of my kids grandparents are loving and active grandparents, but I can tell you the bond with the local grandparents is just incomparable. We don't \"need\" their help; we certainly appreciate occasional babysitting but our kids are in full time daycare and we are independent and stable. But we love having grandparents integrated into our daily lives. We love being able to text and say \"hey, want to join us at the park for a few hours? Or can we come over for dinner tonight?\" I've been trying to convince my own parents to move closer to me for years, and I would be absolutely devastated if my in laws moved away. Even though we don't \"need\" their help. \n\nYou're not responsible for caring for your grandkids, but your daughter is right that nothing compares to having a multigenerational support system when raising kids. Please try to empathize with her for wanting that for herself and her baby. Only you can decide if your retirement will be more fulfilling by doing more senior social activities, or by nurturing your family relationships. And it's OK if you decide to do what's best for you, even if that's not what's best for your daughter and grandchild. But don't be surprised if she's justifiably hurt and upset by it.", "Yes your daughter is feeling rejected, and that's ok. You have goals of what you want to do in your later years and she has goals on raising her child that conflict with that. You're both adults and allowed to be frustrated.

My parents were pressured to be part of village generation, to live in a family house, but my parents rejected it and I am glad they did because it really gave us space and freedom. If my mother lived with her family as they wanted her to, she would have to take care of my nieces (she did have to take care of my grandmother and uncle when they were sick, even up to their funeral), but because she lives away from them, she is now free doing whatever she wants to do daily and then visit the family when she wants to or needs to. I love that, she totally deserves it, and you deserve it too. Please, enjoy your life!

I\u2019m super close with my parents but yeah things did change dramatically when I moved 2 hours away, and I\u2019m an adult not a young child growing and changing by the minute.

So the circumstances are similar, but this OP is not like \"I have done my time\" and so it's more easy to see their point of view.", "There's a pretty big difference between the total go-fuck-yourself that the father was giving in that scenario vs this.", "the difference is and as a single father i\u2019m amazed i have to explain this context, OP is making a move that will better their lives and isn\u2019t saying she doesn\u2019t want to be involved in the grandchild\u2019s life just that she won\u2019t be as available for child care assistance, many grandparents don\u2019t help with this at all. i\u2019m guessing grandma is still likely to go to the grandkids recitals and games.\n\nthe other dude basically said I barely wanted my kid why would i want my grandkid, and having them around is annoying and reminds me of how i hated becoming a dad and wish it never happened.\n\ni\u2019m not sure how you don\u2019t get the social nuance here", "> Families are scattered all over the place, that doesn\u2019t affect their closeness.\n\nI think this is wishful thinking. Yes, you can deeply love your far away family & have a great relationship with them. But the idea that it doesn\u2019t matter if you can see someone once a week or more vs a few times a year is just crazy. Even as an adult my relationship with my parents & siblings definitely changed a lot after I moved out of the city they live in, even though I\u2019m \u201conly\u201d 2 hours away. You simply cannot replace being able to spontaneously hang out with a few overnight visits a year. And if I lived further it would be even worse\n\nIt\u2019s even more dramatic with kids who grow & change really quickly, and have shorter memories for things and less tolerance for phone calls. The difference between my relationship with the family I grew up near and the family I did not is massive. A kid is just going to feel very different about their grandmother they see once a week or more and who comes to every event vs someone they have to go visit a few times per year. Completely different situations.", "There is a huge difference between 30 min and 3 hours though. I think it\u2019s really unlikely to expect anyone will be driving 6 hour round trips once per month. Especially with the grandparents getting older and the daughter having young kids.", "The situation was not at all the same - apples and oranges literally.", "Either way the outcome is the same. Grandparents can set boundaries and it doesn\u2019t make this an asshole. They can set the boundaries for whatever reason they want.", "no, he was a resentful asshole who treated being a parent like a chore that he had finally finished. op actually cares about her kid and grandkid.", "You don't even know what you're talking about. That guy had nowhere near 50% custody. He had 4 days a month plus one month in the summer for the first 13 years of his kid's life. The issue is that he completely wanted to wash his hands of his son and grandson now that his son was an adult, and even told commenters that he didn't care that he was damaging his relationship with his son. The man couldn't even play grandpa and go to his grandson's baseball tournament for a couple hours. That's far from \"worshipping at the altar of Children\" or making parenthood his entire identity. You're just being dramatic for no reason.\n\nAnd before you try it, I'm staunchly child free and have been since middle school. That guy was just an asshole.", "You get it and thank you for getting it. Hating being a parent doesn\u2019t make someone an asshole and any grandparent can set boundaries.\n\nThis woman and that man are very similar in the ways that matter most for the purpose of this thread. She\u2019s not less of an asshole just because she enjoys kids. \n\nThat man did his duty despite his feelings and age. That\u2019s just being an upstanding citizen. People pretending he sacrificed nothing for his child and is a monster for wanting to do cool shit instead of hanging out with a grandchild child are assholes.\n\nAt what point can that man stop being guilted.\n\nThis woman is also not the asshole for wanting to move.", "\n\n>He had 50 percent custody for 13 years,\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH he abso-fucking-lutly did not. he had the kid every other weekend and one summer a month for 13 years. that is barely 20 percent custody, if that, and he only took kid the last five years cause he didn't like his step dad.", "If her daughter was actually including her, absolutely. But her daughter is keeping her away on the weekends and doesn\u2019t actually seem to want the multigenerational experience she had growing up (or perhaps her husband doesn\u2019t want it).\n\nRegardless there\u2019s nothing to pay forward here because her daughter isn\u2019t interested.", "Yeah I feel like a lot of people here cannot even comprehend what a close relationship with family is like because the idea that the relationship won\u2019t be affected by a 3 hour move is absolutely insane.", "Perhaps the daughter should move to be close to her mother then.", "\n\n>The only major difference is that the other post's OP didnt have primary custody until the kid was 13\n\nno, the other major difference was the other op's attitude. he completely resented his son, and made it clear that now that the kid was an adult, he wanted almost nothing to do with him", "The guy yesterday said he didn't like being around his grandson and put on a mask of pretending to", "the guy yesterday made it clear he resents his son and doesn't like either him or his grandson.", "The details are what is important and you can't just pretend they aren't.", "And predictably look at the down votes.\n\nPeople in this sub just can't see past their own hypocrisy.", "I mean, my own in laws live 3 hours away and I feel like we are close with them. I definitely think it\u2019s possible to have a close relationship across distance. But it\u2019s not possible to have a multi generational home experience.", "\ud83d\udcafthis.  Daughter can\u2019t have her cake & eat it", "This is the comment I was looking for! If I was OP I'd point out exactly these things to my daughter - kindly and with love & lots of reassurances of course", "\n\n>The OP had been a single dad to the son. \n\nokay, let's not twist facts. he absolutely was not a 'single father'. his ex was the primary caregiver until the kid was 13 and dad only took on the primary role cause his kid didn't like his stepfather. up until then he was an every other weekend dad and one month a sumer dad. he also was not interested in being involved with his son or grandson at all now that his kid was grown. he saw it as a chore that he finally finished. completely different than this one.", "Yeah no..he barely had the kid the first 13 years of his life then whined about that. What did you read?", "The dad did not want to not going to every little league game. He wanted his son to understand he was done with being a parent (not just grandparent) and that it was a burden to him", "no, we just aren't dumb enough to look at two vaguely similar post and act like they're the same thing.", "Yes this is a very different attitude than that", "Yeah no...that's absolutely not how that went.. He was very present prior to his son living with him. You apparently didn't read all of what he said.", "It doesnt make a difference, but id just like to let you know that you ended up counting the two weekends in the summer twice", "it absolutely is not", "That post was a man complaining he \u201csacrificed\u201d his 20s by having his son twice a month and wanted literally nothing to do with his grandchild.", "Not really. Little League games last like an hour tops and it's very cute. My friends even willingly and without being asked have come to my daughter's games. It's only a burden if you don't like your grandchildren.", "if my kid or grandkids were part of them, yes.", "Check ur dms", "The outcome is the same though. Both people want to live their lives and limit how much responsibility they take on for their grandkids. Their intentions behind it have nothing to do with he fact that a grandparent doesn\u2019t owe their kids free childcare or really anything once they become an adult.", "And when asked for links that prove it, there are always very important differences in the post which have NOTHING to do with what gender the person is. The fact that you all keep breaking it down to man vs woman is ridiculous.", "Holy cow it is NOT the same at all! OP move to be close to her daughter and to be available for her in whatever way she needed. As time has gone on she really does not hear from her daughter and her daughter does not ask anything of her, so she would like to move someplace more suitable for her life. The other post was about a son who NEEDED his father and WANTED him to be involved and the father wanted nothing to do with it.\n\nJesus H Christ.", "Where does the kid need the father? He\u2019s got a house and a wife and is better setup than his own father was.\n\nDad did his job and is ready to be free. That\u2019s fine. Neither person is an asshole for choosing whatever level of freedom they want.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that the father never wanted a kid but still went through all the motions to create a successful adult.\n\nJust because he\u2019s a Philly 40 now doesn\u2019t mean he has to be an involved grandpa. He already did the duty thing he didn\u2019t want once. \n\n\nMaybe my ideas on this stuff is skewed because I live in a neighborhood/city full of foster kids and deadbeat dads but the OP from the other post was pretty ok in my books.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine most of these dads getting their kid setup in a Union at such a young age. His son will have a defined benefit plan and is probably better off than most redditors. He can raise a kid with his wife just fine."]}
