My daughter is married with a 1.5 year old child.  She and her hubby got jobs in another city before the baby was born.  My spouse and I also retired 2 years before they had the baby.  We later bought a house in the same city that she and  her hubby relocated to (My daughter kept sending me \"for sale\" listings- I also asked her hubby if he was ok with us moving close to them) once they announced they were expecting/pregnant.  The house we bought is a 10 minute drive to their house.  We have now owned this house for 2.5 years. \n\nThen Covid happened so my daughter did not have the opportunity to get out in the community and meet people (She is very social).   I also bought the house to help her adjust to new motherhood while on mat leave, and offered the house to be used by her out-of-town friends and Son-in-law's family when we went on vacation or to our cottage. I also bought the house because my daughter said that she might not be able to get daycare until the baby was 18+ mo, and her hubby travelled for work, so I would be close by to help her.  \n\nDaughter has now returned to work, they got full time daycare, and her hubby no longer travels for work.  When her out of town friends/family visit they prefer to stay at their place.  My daughter and husband like the weekends for their family time (which I respect), so there will be very little need for me/us.  My daughter grew up in a multigenerational home (duplex) from age 8+, the grandparents on the main floor, myself, hubby and daughter on the upper floors unit.  So, she loved bouncing back and forth from our home to the grandparents. It was the old fashioned village, but there were challenges at times.\n\nI  worked full time for 44 years, and also looked after my parents during their declining years until they passed just before I retired.  Covid kept my hubby and I quite isolated during our first few years of retirement, but spending time with our daughter and SIL, helped us to not feel isolated.  My Son-in-law's father lives 4 hours away from them, and his mother lives in the US (a 14 hour drive) but they visit them a few times per year.\n\nI want to move to a city that will be 3 hours away from our daughter and her family, as we love that city/town vibe and it also has a large seniors population with an abundance of things for active seniors to do. My hubby wants to do this move too.   We would then come for frequent visits (when invited/needed) and stay in their home, just like her in-laws do, but my daughter thinks IATA for wanting to move away and not continue to be a village generation since they do not have any relatives living in the city they choose to live in.  I think my daughter feels rejected and that I am being selfish to move away from her, her hubby and the baby.

I'm saying that they have to consider what it means for their family relation, and  take that into consideration. And then make a decision based on that.\n\n> Families are scattered all over the place, that doesn\u2019t affect their closeness\n\nYes it does. It doesn't always affect it negatively, but it always has an effect. Of course it does. Having someone live next door is not the same as having them live a day's travel away.\n\n> Seeing people less often is not always a bad thing\n\nTrue. I never said it was. I said it was a factor to be considered.\n\nYou seem to have misread my post as saying \"If you move away your daughter will cut you out of her life and you'll be miserable forever\".\nAnd that wasn't what I said.\n\nI simply said that the question to ask is not \"will this make me an asshole\", but rather \"how will this impact my family relations\".

People deserve to live their lives without being guilted into sticking around out of obligation- adult children are no exception.

They need friends, their own community of people in their shared season of life. Having an active lifestyle while they\u2019re physically and mentally capable is extremely important to their quality of life, not being on standby for if and when their daughter needs them. Their daughter doesn\u2019t seem to prioritize seeing her parents or nurturing a relationship as it is, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t consider moving.\n\nRelationships are a two way street, therefore if her daughter feels having a close relationship with them is important, then she, too, can travel to see her parents.", "No, he was 26 (21 when he had the kid) and married.", "The OP had been a single dad to the son. The son was married and had a great job the dad ushered him into. The son was angry the OP didn't want to do all this grandpa stuff with the son's kid.", "The roles between the two posts are NOT reversed. \n\nThe fact that anyone would see this as the same shows how much more is expected of women vs men when it comes to children and grand children.\n\nYou truly think a women moving to a completely new city and purchasing a new home ten minutes from her child to then help provide childcare for their grand child for first 18 months and now moving to a different city that is car ride away and plan to frequently visit their child and be present for all big milestones for their grandchild is the same as a man who actively avoids spending time with his grandchild and dreads the thought of attending big events in their grandchild\u2019s life because he can\u2019t spare a few hours even once a month. \n\nYeah totally same."]}
