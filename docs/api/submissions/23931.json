My daughter is married with a 1.5 year old child.  She and her hubby got jobs in another city before the baby was born.  My spouse and I also retired 2 years before they had the baby.  We later bought a house in the same city that she and  her hubby relocated to (My daughter kept sending me \"for sale\" listings- I also asked her hubby if he was ok with us moving close to them) once they announced they were expecting/pregnant.  The house we bought is a 10 minute drive to their house.  We have now owned this house for 2.5 years. \n\nThen Covid happened so my daughter did not have the opportunity to get out in the community and meet people (She is very social).   I also bought the house to help her adjust to new motherhood while on mat leave, and offered the house to be used by her out-of-town friends and Son-in-law's family when we went on vacation or to our cottage. I also bought the house because my daughter said that she might not be able to get daycare until the baby was 18+ mo, and her hubby travelled for work, so I would be close by to help her.  \n\nDaughter has now returned to work, they got full time daycare, and her hubby no longer travels for work.  When her out of town friends/family visit they prefer to stay at their place.  My daughter and husband like the weekends for their family time (which I respect), so there will be very little need for me/us.  My daughter grew up in a multigenerational home (duplex) from age 8+, the grandparents on the main floor, myself, hubby and daughter on the upper floors unit.  So, she loved bouncing back and forth from our home to the grandparents. It was the old fashioned village, but there were challenges at times.\n\nI  worked full time for 44 years, and also looked after my parents during their declining years until they passed just before I retired.  Covid kept my hubby and I quite isolated during our first few years of retirement, but spending time with our daughter and SIL, helped us to not feel isolated.  My Son-in-law's father lives 4 hours away from them, and his mother lives in the US (a 14 hour drive) but they visit them a few times per year.\n\nI want to move to a city that will be 3 hours away from our daughter and her family, as we love that city/town vibe and it also has a large seniors population with an abundance of things for active seniors to do. My hubby wants to do this move too.   We would then come for frequent visits (when invited/needed) and stay in their home, just like her in-laws do, but my daughter thinks IATA for wanting to move away and not continue to be a village generation since they do not have any relatives living in the city they choose to live in.  I think my daughter feels rejected and that I am being selfish to move away from her, her hubby and the baby.

It doesn't always affect it negatively, but it always has an effect. Of course it does.

All of my kids grandparents are loving and active grandparents, but I can tell you the bond with the local grandparents is just incomparable. We don't \"need\" their help; we certainly appreciate occasional babysitting but our kids are in full time daycare and we are independent and stable. But we love having grandparents integrated into our daily lives. We love being able to text and say \"hey, want to join us at the park for a few hours? Or can we come over for dinner tonight?\" I've been trying to convince my own parents to move closer to me for years, and I would be absolutely devastated if my in laws moved away. Even though we don't \"need\" their help. \n\nYou're not responsible for caring for your grandkids, but your daughter is right that nothing compares to having a multigenerational support system when raising kids. Please try to empathize with her for wanting that for herself and her baby. Only you can decide if your retirement will be more fulfilling by doing more senior social activities, or by nurturing your family relationships. And it's OK if you decide to do what's best for you, even if that's not what's best for your daughter and grandchild. But don't be surprised if she's justifiably hurt and upset by it.", "Yes your daughter is feeling rejected, and that's ok. You have goals of what you want to do in your later years and she has goals on raising her child that conflict with that. You're both adults and allowed to be frustrated.

My parents were pressured to be part of village generation, to live in a family house, but my parents rejected it and I am glad they did because it really gave us space and freedom. If my mother lived with her family as they wanted her to, she would have to take care of my nieces (she did have to take care of my grandmother and uncle when they were sick, even up to their funeral), but because she lives away from them, she is now free doing whatever she wants to do daily and then visit the family when she wants to or needs to. I love that, she totally deserves it, and you deserve it too. Please, enjoy your life!

I\u2019m super close with my parents but yeah things did change dramatically when I moved 2 hours away, and I\u2019m an adult not a young child growing and changing by the minute.

Even as an adult my relationship with my parents & siblings definitely changed a lot after I moved out of the city they live in, even though I\u2019m \u201conly\u201d 2 hours away. You simply cannot replace being able to spontaneously hang out with a few overnight visits a year. And if I lived further it would be even worse\n\nIt\u2019s even more dramatic with kids who grow & change really quickly, and have shorter memories for things and less tolerance for phone calls. The difference between my relationship with the family I grew up near and the family I did not is massive.

And usually that obligation is one sided. \n\nFurthermore, family who live next door, down the street, one city over, etc, have been known to overstay their welcome, come over unannounced, get overly invested in situations that are none of their business. Or, as in this case, get taken for granted because \u201cthey\u2019re just down the street\u201d. It\u2019s like people who live minutes away from the beach but hadn\u2019t been to the beach in years because \u201cit\u2019s  always right there\u201d.

Perhaps the paternal grandparents\u2019 structured visits create more purposeful memories than those from her maternal grandparents who live only a few minutes away, yet never get tapped to do anything. \n\nConsider that OP and her husband made a lot of sacrifices to relocate: they sold their former home, bought a new one (after many suggestions from their daughter), and moved with the purpose of being close to their daughter and granddaughter and seeing them a whole lot more often. That simply didn\u2019t happen, that end of the bargain wasn\u2019t upheld. Their granddaughter is in daycare and their daughter and SIL returned to their careers. It was pretty much during the pandemic where everything was on lockdown that OP and her husband even held a convenient purpose for their daughter. Why should OP and her husband continue to maintain the responsibility of staying in the area? To what end? So they can continue to feel edged out, unfulfilled, unwanted and unneeded? Their daughter should be making more of an effort, but with her parents so close by, she takes them for granted, as though they\u2019ll always be there.

You want them to be a martyrs? \n\nYou\u2019ll one day get old, so put yourself in their situation. Perspective is important. Older people have needs, too. They need interaction with their peers, to explore their interests. They need to be social and engaged- it\u2019s necessary for their general health. You expect them to standby their phone or door, waiting for their daughter (or loved ones, in general) to request their presence? Because if they make a mention of their needs to their daughter (or loved ones), they\u2019ll likely be seen as needy and overbearing. Their daughter already shows little to no regard for them, and it was her brainchild for them to move in the first place. Do you honestly think their daughter is going to sacrifice her career and time to take care of her parents as they age? They\u2019re mentally and physically capable, yet she doesn\u2019t bother making plans with them as it is. OP and her husband need to advocate for themselves and do as they need; go to an active retiree community that caters to their needs, with peers, common interests and hobbies, medical care, etc.  \n\nAnd the multigenerational situation you\u2019re referring to, you\u2019re talking perhaps 2+ decades earlier. What multigenerational living is going on now? OP raised her daughter in the same duplex as her parents, where they were a constant/daily presence. In this case, OP and her husband uprooted their lives at their daughter\u2019s behest to live in a completely separate home, minutes away, seemingly forgotten and taken for granted once everyone\u2019s activities and lives resumed post-pandemic lockdown. That is not how you treat family and expect them to continue putting up with it. \n\nYou want to talk skin in the game? OP and her husband put A LOT of skin in the game: they took care of their aging parents, worked for over four decades, raised a child to adulthood, sold their home, bought a new one to be close to their daughter and granddaughter, and now they\u2019re so unfulfilled they want to rightfully move to experience their second act.\n\nETA: I grew up in a multigenerational home- with my paternal grandparents in their home. My grandparents and parents argued all the time, my parents rarely had a kind word to say about them, but they didn\u2019t hesitate to use my grandparents for free childcare whenever they pleased. We ended up moving away, but I was still close to my grandparents, as we flew up to see my grandparents for the summer. My parents did not take care of my grandparents, I did, out of obligation,  to the best of my ability, while married, in school and raising my eldest. The only help I received was from home health care during the weekdays. \n\nIn short, you put an unnecessary burden of perpetuating a multigenerational arrangement on OP and her husband, when it\u2019s the next generation that failed to keep it going.

But as I said, the ladder is being pulled up behind OP before they even get to that point. I also find the tired line of \u201cIt\u2019s unpaid labor!!\u201d to be such a resentful and dysfunctionally capitalistic lens of viewing communal and familial support. \n\nDo you have a reason to believe she\u2019s ungrateful and unwilling to reciprocate by assuming her role in the cycle of \u201cthe village\u201d?

Not forcing a 50-50 split of custody plus not wanting to have a kid at 21 got many readers angry--when they had no idea about any of their specific circumstances, such as where they lived, what his job was, etc. A lot of people have jobs that won't allow a 50-50 split of custody unless the parents live really close (not that it ever came up because we're happily married, but my husband's job is like that.)

Just because I\u2019m working and have an 18 month old baby and can\u2019t spend as much time with her *right now* doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t important to me to have her close. If she doesn\u2019t feel needed enough for a little bit, she\u2019s just going to leave?\n\n\u2014She knows how important my grandparents were to me?  Does she really not want a relationship with our child like that?  \n\nThose are the things I imagine. And they might not be at all what she\u2019s thinking. And if they are, they might not be fair. \n\nI took the time to put all that into words, though, because two different ones of my friends have had their parents move away while their children were young. And these were the things they each said to me when it was happening. Heartbroken. In tears. They each tried to persuade their parents to stay. They reminded their parents how precious these years were with the children. \n\nIn each case, the parents did move away with promises to visit often. Neither visited quite as much as they imagined. Life is busy. \n\nThe grandparents reminded the children what a wonderful place their new locations were and that they should just come visit them. In each case the child carted their own child/children to visit the grandparents far more often than the grandparents came to stay. \n\nThe relationships became qualitatively different. Less intimate. Less mundane. Less reliable. Less present. Less connected. \n\nOne of my friends still carts her son to see her parents once or twice a year. The other was, tragically, diagnosed with a terminal illness and died, leaving behind her spouse and children. I don\u2019t know how often those children go to visit their grandparents now. \n\nThat second one is a very unusual situation, of course. And I\u2019m not saying that you should plan to be close because your child might die. Reading your post just reminds me of my friend talking to me when her parents were leaving. She couldn\u2019t imagine what would be so important to them that they would rather have that than this precious time with her little family. \n\nYou can\u2019t live your life frozen, driven by fear of all the \u201cwhat-ifs.\u201d  *But* I do think it is worth asking yourself if what you will be gaining from moving is worth what you will potentially be losing with your daughter and grandchild. \n\nWhatever you decide doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, but it will impact your daughter and the relationship you have with her. And that will, most definitely, affect the relationship you have with your grandchild.", "NTA\n\nGo enjoy your retirement. You raised your kids and it is a day trip to visit if needed.", "Wasn\u2019t that the father that said he pretty much resented his son for being born ?  \n I think the AH comments were more for that than not helping", "Lots of differences between that post and this. \n\nFor one, the guy in the other post sounded like his family was a nuisance and he only wanted to put in the minimum amount of required time/work (until his child turned 18).\n\nOP here sounds like she\u2019s gone above and beyond for everyone: taking care of their parents, moved close by daughter in case they\u2019re ever needed, offered their home to daughters friends and husbands family, etc. \n\nNow that daughter and family are all set, OP wants to finally enjoy her retirement, but daughter isn\u2019t being considerate.", "This is the standard modern American take, but for most of human history across time and space this is _extremely_ weird. This would be seen as ripping apart the family just as much as divorce, but it\u2019s the goal. It\u2019s like having the mission be to give birth to a child and then immediately split apart. It\u2019s more the kind of thing that happens from disaster or hatred.", "no the dad in that post did that not the son", "Im sorry. I thought this was America", "Or just loathe organized sports in general... Screaming, sweat, sunburn and parental pressure tactics that will require therapy for their kids later in life.  Not my idea of a fun time. I would rather have dental work than endure a day of that.", "This was my grandparents too. They might get me the dress for the concert but they rarely attended the actual events.  I hold no fault with their actions at all."]}
