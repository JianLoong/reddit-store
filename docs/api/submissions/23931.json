{"id": 23931, "submission_id": "15iw6gr", "title": "AITA for wanting to move away from my daughter to live my best life?", "selftext": "No, I'm not a dead beat mom, my daughter is an adult (F) 33.   My daughter is married with a 1.5 year old child.  She and her hubby got jobs in another city before the baby was born.  My spouse and I also retired 2 years before they had the baby.  We later bought a house in the same city that she and  her hubby relocated to (My daughter kept sending me \"for sale\" listings- I also asked her hubby if he was ok with us moving close to them) once they announced they were expecting/pregnant.  The house we bought is a 10 minute drive to their house.  We have now owned this house for 2.5 years. \n\nThen Covid happened so my daughter did not have the opportunity to get out in the community and meet people (She is very social).   I also bought the house to help her adjust to new motherhood while on mat leave, and offered the house to be used by her out-of-town friends and Son-in-law's family when we went on vacation or to our cottage. I also bought the house because my daughter said that she might not be able to get daycare until the baby was 18+ mo, and her hubby travelled for work, so I would be close by to help her.  \n\nDaughter has now returned to work, they got full time daycare, and her hubby no longer travels for work.  When her out of town friends/family visit they prefer to stay at their place.  My daughter and husband like the weekends for their family time (which I respect), so there will be very little need for me/us.  My daughter grew up in a multigenerational home (duplex) from age 8+, the grandparents on the main floor, myself, hubby and daughter on the upper floors unit.  So, she loved bouncing back and forth from our home to the grandparents. It was the old fashioned village, but there were challenges at times.\n\nI  worked full time for 44 years, and also looked after my parents during their declining years until they passed just before I retired.  Covid kept my hubby and I quite isolated during our first few years of retirement, but spending time with our daughter and SIL, helped us to not feel isolated.  My Son-in-law's father lives 4 hours away from them, and his mother lives in the US (a 14 hour drive) but they visit them a few times per year.\n\nI want to move to a city that will be 3 hours away from our daughter and her family, as we love that city/town vibe and it also has a large seniors population with an abundance of things for active seniors to do. My hubby wants to do this move too.   We would then come for frequent visits (when invited/needed) and stay in their home, just like her in-laws do, but my daughter thinks IATA for wanting to move away and not continue to be a village generation since they do not have any relatives living in the city they choose to live in.  I think my daughter feels rejected and that I am being selfish to move away from her, her hubby and the baby.

You've spent years, probably decades, taking care of everyone else. Raising kids, helping with grandkids, taking care of aging relatives. Don't spend your whole life doing for others. You deserve some time to do the things you want to do and enjoy the things you love. You deserve the opportunity to figure out who you are on your own. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour daughter is being selfish. Move, and enjoy every bit of fun and happiness you can get in that new city!", "NTA! You\u2019re in your golden years, enjoy them.

In an emergency I expect you'd find a way to help, but you are under no obligation for ongoing availability.  It appears your daughter is living quite independently from you, which is fine. But she can't expect you to be there 'just in case'. She wants a multigenerational household without you having much to do with the household,  which I find puzzling. I'd say go live your life the way you want.", "NTA. Sure, maybe moving away from yourself could be considered \"selfish\" but honestly, it's selfishness in the best way. We don't owe our entire lives to other people. I think the term selfish has negative connotations because we are somehow expected to only give and consider others and that's not a healthy way to live. Enjoy your retirement, you have earned it!", "NTA. You've raised your Daughter, she has a family of her own and doesn't rely on you so much.. It's time you and your Husband to put yourselves first and not let your daughter guilt you into staying for her own selfish reasons .\n\nGO FOR IT !", "NTA - 3hrs is nothing. She\u2019s an adult. A full grown adult and not a barely there 22yr old. She\u2019s probably in her feelings. But you don\u2019t have to stay in the same city forever.", "NTA\n\nYou and your husband have to live your lives- you are more than a logistical means to an end for everyone else\u2019s lives. You both deserve engaging experiences, a supportive and active community with similar interests. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, not on standby for if/when they need you. \n\nYou moved near your daughter with an abundance of good, generous  intentions, but you have to live your life, too. Your daughter and son-in-law have made decisions for their family\u2019s needs, their extended family and friend network aren\u2019t taking you up in your fantastic offer to stay at your home when you\u2019re away.

It's only a few hours away.", "NTA.\n\nIt looks like your daughter is more interested in what the village can do for her than in what she can do for the village. Buy your house in the town of your dreams and visit your daughter and grandchildren frequently.", "I think you're asking the wrong question. The issue isn't whether or not you're the asshole, it is how close you want to be with your daughter and your grandkid.\n\nMoving away means you'll see them less, even if you visit frequently. It also means they'll rely on you less, and you'll play a smaller role in your grandkids first years.\n\nMaking that decision does not make you an asshole, so NTA. But even if it doesn't make you an asshole it might still change your relation with your daughter and your grandkid, and the much more _important_ question is how you feel about that.\nIf your daughter feels rejected, or that you're removing yourself from her life, then her opinion is not going to change just because \"Reddit confirmed I'm not an asshole\". Then you'll have to talk it out with her and figure out how to compromise to get as close as possible to the life and the family relationship you all want.", "Nta - she needs to form her own village now, not just rely on you and your husband.

Your daughter does not appear to need you right now, and she also seems to want your support but not to reciprocate by including you socially.

Wow. You are all adults. Time for daughter to stand on her own two feet. Go and live in retirement wherever makes you happy.

No one deserves to feel like their existence serves someone else\u2019s convenience. OP and her husband deserve to have active, fulfilling lives after working and caring for everyone else, including their adult daughter (and moving into a home they made available to their daughter\u2019s friends and in-laws). Their daughter is an adult, and clearly has the resources at her disposal that made OP\u2019s move unnecessary. It was all well and good during the pandemic, but it seems everyone else is back in the swing of things except for OP and her husband. \n\nFamilies are scattered all over the place, that doesn\u2019t affect their closeness. Seeing people less often is not always a bad thing- it gives people the chance to appreciate those people when they do get to see them. \n\nIt seems that OP\u2019s daughter took having OP and her husband around for granted and never utilized their presence and generosity. OP and her husband moved with the express purpose of being closer to their daughter and grandchild but their assistance and company weren\u2019t sought out.", "Totally agree that doing what is most fulfilling for you doesn\u2019t make you T A. Sure there are going to be a lot of people that do.\nThey moved. They decided which town they wanted to establish themselves and raise a family. They then obviously wanted you closer so sent listings.  You don\u2019t have the same connection to the town so you are choosing to move a little ways away. The fact you are still willing to come help is great. \nIt\u2019s all about what relationships you want. My dad would love to travel but there is no way my mom will leave the grandkids for months at a time.  So he\u2019s thinking that every month or so she will need to fly home for a week before joining him again. Or fly the grandkids out. My mom is the first person my oldest wants when she\u2019s mad at me. \nBeing 3 hours, 6 hour round trip away is a lot. But if you are willing to make it work it will work. Just know that you aren\u2019t going to be first or second call for help in an emergency. And the relationship with the grandkids will show that."]}
