The biggest issue is not forgetting to examine all the fabric, even if it's just a forgotten winter scarf that should have been in storage. The babies are SUPER tiny, and are not always easy to see with the naked eye.\n\nThe containers of earth are on Amazon and in Walmart and are about ten-twelve bucks a container. Other than that, you need garbage bags to keep things contained, and quarters for the washers/dryers. You will likely have to repeat this, in addition to mopping and vacuuming. If you are in an apt, you have to alert the landlord, they will likely cover it, if not, it's all on you. \n\nIn the event all of this is too intimidating, get more estimates.", "Watch Mark Rober's video on YouTube.

And he didn't give a shit.", "Diatomaceous earth.", "Yeah, I used food grade diatomaceous earth too, back when my son's first wife went on a book signing tour and brought back bedbugs.  I couldn't afford to replace 2 queen sized mattresses, 2 box springs, two sofas and one recliner and not to mention the $5000.00 I was quoted to heat treat the house.  So I bought 2 bags of 50 lbs diatomaceous earth after much research and 4 plastic, zip style mattress protectors.  After covering the mattresses & box springs with the mattress protectors, I shook a lot of diatomaceous earth inside of the protectors.  The protectors prevented the bedbugs from getting out and the diatomaceous earth would cut them up if they walked in it.  I had two steamers (not the hand held one but the big ones) and wrapped the sofas and recliners in plastic, taped down any openings (other than where I would put the steamer hose) and turned on the steamers for 2 hours each.  Yeah, sofas and recliner were soaked but that heat killed the bedbugs in them.  I also unscrewed all the covers on the light switches and electrical socket and squirted diatomaceous earth inside them.  I sprinkled diatomaceous earth all around the baseboards around the entire house.  I also brought plastic bowls to sit each sofas and bed legs in and pour diatomaceous earth in each bowls.  And to be on the safe side, I also put globs of petroleum jelly on the legs of the sofa and on the metal legs of the bed frame.  I cleaned out all of the dressers and 3 closets of clothes (which I placed them outside) and washed what I could in hot water and those I couldn't, I dried them in the dryer on hot setting 3 times.  It was a **lot of work** but I managed to get rid of any and all bedbugs and saved myself $10,000.  This was 10 years ago, and am bed bug clear but man have I become paranoid regarding bed bugs'.  To this day, I won't go to a sit in movie theater after reading a review of one woman leaving theater and finding welts on her arms from bedbugs bites.", "I only know this because of an allergy panel, but I'm not allergic to them.  I've never knowingly been exposed to bed bugs though so I have no idea if I'd notice a bite or not, but at least the bite wouldn't cause an allergic reaction I suppose?  I would think I'd still notice getting bitten.   Bugs freak me out though, it's why I don't buy used cloth furniture and I hate moving.  I'm terrified of moving into a building with a bug problem.", "Maybe but he must have noticed them somehow because he\u2019s been aware of them", "My mom is allergic and she had welts everywhere.

It drove me into insanity since I had never dealt with fleas before and now I'm getting them on me from just walking around my own apartment. \n\nOur landlord who was retired to Bermuda or fuck knows where was of no use. We tried as best as we could but with the indoor cats (our only pets) it was a difficulty. One of our cats reacted negatively to a flea collar, which I was already weary of. We gave flea baths but wanted to limit it as to prevent damage to their skin etc,. I vacuumed constantly. We had an insecticide spray but wanted to limit because, again, the cats. \n\nOddly, when we went to move to our new apartment in August, they just... vanished. Weren't an issue on moving day.

Yuck.", "YTA and cheap and disgusting, too. Bed bugs can ruin entire properties. Just because you care more about your wallet than hygeine doesn't mean your ex does.
