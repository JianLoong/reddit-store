Everyone knows that if you are gonna list something online, to look up the value beforehand to get the most out of it. Or at least most do...", "NTA. I'm sorry, but you did not misrepresent anything. You were the buyer. If seller cares about getting top price, it's up to them to do at least the little bit of basic research that you did.  You gave her the price she asked, you didn't even try to bargain her down.\n\n If your bf walked into a store and they were having a big Black Friday sale, would he insist on paying full price?  This is not remotely unethical.  It's not your unpaid job to do the seller's work for her. This is how second hand sales work. BF and seller are WAY out of line.", "NTA\n\nThis was a transaction between strangers.\n\nShe offered, you accepted, end of story.\n\nI'm sure she's learned a valuable lesson from this, and you got a really good deal on a credenza!\n\nHugs", "NTA\n\nIf they're too lazy to check other listings, then it's their loss, you were smart enough to check and got an absolute bargain for it!", "NTA. It\u2019s up to the seller to know the value and to set the price accordingly. And many people just need to offload items and set the price low.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m with you - this is on her to research before she sets the price. It\u2019s not your fault she didn\u2019t do any research before listing it.", "NTA - If she was capable of finding the value after the fact, she was capable of waiting until she found the value prior to posting.", "NTA . You saw an item for sale and you bought it. It's not your responsibility to price things for her.", "NTA.\n\nYou aren't a reseller, you wanted it for yourself so not TA.", "NTA. She was stupid. Even worse that she immediately after went to check the listings instead of doing it before", "If you are selling something, it\u2019s up to the seller to do the research regarding resale value, etc. Were you actions ethical.. maybe not .. but it\u2019s her own fault. NTA", "Nope NTA at all! I have personal experience on the sellers end & sure was I annoyed I assumed & didn\u2019t google? Sure. Am I happy as hell a Girl in Cali got a cute backpack for her daughter at half what other sellers wanted? Yup she was smarter than me there. Not every seller has to react like me, but, that *still* doesn\u2019t make it your issue if they didn\u2019t do their homework. People sell at what they feel it\u2019s worth to them at the end of the day. Honestly, great job snagging it OP. & again, NTA.", "NTA. At a loss for any rationalization otherwise. I was in a similar sitch with a friend. She was downsizing (lost her job, couldn\u2019t pay rent). I helped her move the stuff she was keeping & then we sorted the remaining into resell, donate, trash. Every time I list something i google it to see cost and dimensions/details. She had a tonnnnn of thrifted finds I\u2019ve made a decent amount off of. I usually tell her and she\u2019s impressed with the margins. I felt guilty a little bit ago and we talked about it. She said: \u201cwhy is it unfair? I could\u2019ve sold it online but I didn\u2019t. I needed it gone. The deal was no givebacks\u201d \n1. Lady is actively wrong. Ignorance is a luxury which she apparently can\u2019t afford. If she can list an item on marketplace she can def google it! Especially if the brand was obvious. \n2. Dishonesty implies misleading or falsifying. You paid her requested price. Maybe your boyfriend is more self-sacrificing or maybe he just likes to think he is. It might sound morally icky when you said what happened, but that isn\u2019t an example of dishonesty.", "NTA - She could have looked it up herself before she priced it.  For all you knew she had done so and just wanted to get rid of it.", "NTA. Well done you - great buy.\n\nYou have no obligation to pay more than what a seller asks. If they made a mistake in asking too little, then that's because of their laziness. It takes two minutes to research prices.", "NTA I am asked to price check for my grandparents 76 & 71 and their friends also 70+ all the time they know to look online and my Aunt's in their 60s know to price check. I price check things I want in second hand stores to see if it's worth it or at yard sales it's the same thing. If you didn't want it maybe telling her it's worth more might have been a nice gesture but not a necessity.", "NTA. It's up to her to research and price accordingly. \n\nI'll also note that finding other listings for more doesn't mean you could sell it quickly or for that much. Furniture trends vary, and today's top sellers are tomorrow's clearance special. I know of a tea house that purchased some Victorian furniture for a steal for the sole reason that no one else wanted to buy it.", ">Later that evening the seller messaged me because she had seen some other listings come up. She asked if i knew about the retail price and I told her I did\n\n\n\nThis would have been the perfect opportunity for a little white lie. NTA, I\u2019d have said NAH but I think that her calling you a dishonest person and bitching at you about it was an asshole move. She fucked up, she should have accepted the loss when she found out instead of trying to blame you for her being an idiot.", "NTA. You *could've* asked for confirmation of the prize, if it was a mistake. But you aren't obligated to do so.", "NTA - they needed to get rid of it and we're apparently trying to do so quickly. Sometimes you have to take a price cut for that.\n\nWe had a Credenza that we had no space for, and we're trying to find a good home for it and thought about selling it. Went to a family that just got over here from Ukraine, we gave it to them for free.  Glad we did that.", "It's a bit of an AH move but you're not in the wrong. This happens all the time, the seller needs to take responsibility for the asking price they put an item out for. If they get loads of insistent buyers, we'll that's a good indication to take the article back and reconsider/do their homework. NTA.", "NTA. When selling something you should always compare prices with other like items. The seller chose not to and that isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault but their own. You did nothing wrong here.", "NTA- It\u2019s NOT your responsibility to educate her on Furniture Brands and trends. Omitting is NOT the same as being dishonest. She should have known better.", "I\u2019m honestly torn on this one. On one hand, it\u2019s on her for not taking 10 seconds to google the thing. \n\n\nOn the other hand, this isn\u2019t a small difference (like \u2018oh I sold this dress for $25 and it\u2019s worth $90 OOPS oh well) between the selling price and what it\u2019s worth, and it\u2019s not a cheap object. there\u2019s a 10x difference on an expensive object and it would\u2019ve been the neighborly thing to say \u201chey did you look up this brand before listing?\u201d This is fb marketplace with average everyday people and not an antique store or pawn shop. People will make mistakes and you have no idea if the extra $1000 could\u2019ve helped this person out (bills, childcare, mortgage, etc) had they sold it to someone at market value. \n\nI\u2019m not going to give a judgement because honestly i don\u2019t know. You had no obligation to tell her but\u2026 it would\u2019ve been a lot cooler if you did.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she got it for free and if she wanted to get the most money possible for it, she should have priced it out herself. It\u2019s not a customer\u2019s responsibility to tell the seller they\u2019re getting a deal. People give things that cost hundreds or thousands of dollars away in freecycle/buy nothing groups all the time, there was no reason for you to assume she didn\u2019t just want to be rid of ur, especially if she said she was downsizing. My parents just sold a whole set of fancy wall cabinets that retail around $1500 for $200 because they wanted them out of the house fast.", "You knowingly paid someone far below market value for an item.  It\u2019s no different than going into a store and buying something for a far cheaper price because it was mistakenly marked. \n\nYTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your boyfriend needs to adjust his understanding of what people my age, and my father\u2019s age (86) are accustomed to. I would have paid the asking price, and the seller has no right to chew you out for knowing a good deal when you see one. We bought a wonderful dining set complete with pads and 8 padded and caned chairs for $250. The couple was downsizing for an interstate move, and I could tell she was a little reluctant to let it go because she raised her family around that table. In that case, I made sure she was really ok selling it because of the sentimental value.", "You are NTA. I'm getting tired of people infantalizing \"the elderly\" when it comes to computers and the internet. They've been pretty damn common for 20+ years now and have been in the public mind (if not used) for nearing 30. That's almost half of this woman's life. We're getting to a point where age is less of an excuse for tech illiteracy than simple laziness. Hell, Marketplace isn't that much different than Craigslist, and that's been around since 1995.\n\n If she can't be bothered to take two minutes to Google her item's value, that's on her.", "Definitely doesn't change much. I have a 54 yo mom who has 50+ friends...and even they know you look first. It sucks, and is okay to be sad for the lady...but it isn't your fault she undersold it.", "Plenty people around that age use marketplace, eBay, etc and have no problem. This was on her for not doing the proper research before listing! No one to blame but herself.", "My mom is 77, she would have checked ebay.", "Are sure he didn't message her and told her about the real value to make a point? I mean, he feels so strong about it that I could see someone doing that.", "So She's accustomed enough to the online world to post on marketplace, but not accustomed enough to Google what She's selling to determine what it's worth before posting the item. She's the AH for expecting you to fix her mistake."]}
