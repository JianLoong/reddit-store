They are people I care about. \n\nI do not care if my husband goes to a strip club. I\u2019m not upset he went although I was upset I wasn\u2019t given notice so I could adjust mentally. My husband swears it was a last minute decision which I can accept and get over. I knew about it the night of. \n\nHe texted me and told me not to tell the wives. This is where I became upset. I had no intentions of running off to say anything to them but now knowing they\u2019d both be upset is different. I knew 1 likely wouldn\u2019t approve but wasn\u2019t going to inquire to find out for sure. I was surprised about the other wife as I know her husband has gone to strip clubs in the past and once we had all planned to go to a strip club together with another friend but plans didn\u2019t work out. \n\nI initially refused altogether but attempted to compromise with my husband that unless I\u2019m asked specifically I won\u2019t say anything. I can\u2019t actually imagine a scenario where they\u2019d ask me specifically. My husband stated that unless I agree to lie he cannot have me around them at all and won\u2019t invite them over or go over with me. While I consider them friends, they\u2019re all through my husband and aren\u2019t people I usually hang out with without my husband. 1 lives a few hours away. The local one we have hung out a few times without our husbands but it\u2019s rare. It\u2019s almost always a family event with all our kids. Situations I\u2019d be sad to lose. \n\nMy husbands concern is they\u2019ll never want to hang out with him if he causes problems in their relationship and now regrets telling me. Which is a new argument for us because finding out later would be a betrayal to me. \n\nSo AITA if I don\u2019t agree to lie if they ask me specifically?\n\nEdited because I think it might be important after a comment. I said friend to stay in word count.. 1 is a cousin and 1 is a friend of my husbands since boot camp. My husband is no longer active duty but this is a very close friend.

Why does your husband want friends who lie to their wives? Is he that hard up for guy friends?  There would be a major row in my house over the fact that he is  asking you to lie and then blackballing you if you won\u2019t.  I don\u2019t know if I would want my husband hanging out with these guys sins this is how he behaves as a result of it.", "NTA It's not your responsibility to cover for your friends who decided to go to a strip club. And, your husband has no business putting you in that position or issuing ultimatums because you refuse to lie about there whereabouts. The fact he's trying to manipulate you says volumes about your husband's character and none of it is good.", "What goes on there with them to keep it a secret??", "NTA \n\n\"If your wife isn't willing to lie to my wife I  don't think I can hang out with you anymore...\" \n\nNGL I'd be ok if  that dude didn't come around anymore.", "Maybe you should ask your husband why he wants to associate with people like that.\n\nFor some reason he chose to make their problem your problem. A problem that really shouldn't exist if his friends were decent people.", "NTA All of it feels yucky to me and you shouldn't have to feel guilty or gross for what they did. They should be talking to their wives like you and your husband talked.", "Everything else aside, are you okay with knowing your husband is absolutely willing to lie and ask others to do so in order to pull the wool over the wives eyes?? And then telling you that YOU won\u2019t be invited to hang out in their company if you don\u2019t lie for them. Ouch. \n\nNTA but please don\u2019t agree to lie.", "Not at all. You aren\u2019t responsible for keeping his lies in check.", "This to me sounds like pay attention to action not words. I\u2019ve read some of OPs comments and it feels like sandpaper on my skin. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s irritating but based off life, it\u2019s giving me pings of this isn\u2019t right. Like just bc someone is good looking doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t cheat w a stripper. The fact that he\u2019s ok with men who outright lie to their wives, shows that he\u2019s ok with it too. Plain and simple. I bet if you and the wives sat down and layed every thing out, you\u2019d find out MANY things that you all were lied to about. Because you trust him, you trust in what he\u2019s telling you. I understand but good liars use truth in their lies & that\u2019s what makes them believable. Your response to be like well I wasn\u2019t gonna say anything to them but now it\u2019s weird so I feel I should. It\u2019s valid. Because they probably don\u2019t like it and you know it but you want to keep the peace. That\u2019s a situation those men put you all under. If your partner is doing something w sexual undertones that you don\u2019t approve of, you have the right to know and to be able to make decisions based off of fact. Stripper shit seems so 20yr old bs. Like you are going to see real ppl get naked and perform suggestively and don\u2019t see how a partner in a relationship wouldn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s not fake, it\u2019s not porn, it\u2019s not entertainment in the sense of like a ballet bc of dancing. It\u2019s to get horny or I indulge in a raunchy atmosphere. If you\u2019re in a monogamous relationship, it\u2019s easy to see where you wouldn\u2019t like your partner ALONE, IN SECRET going there. (I will say I don\u2019t see anything wrong w going to a strip club or being a stripper but I don\u2019t want my person sexualizing another women and seeing them naked. It\u2019s not porn where they are actors in a movie you don\u2019t interact with. )\nI just suggest you take a beat and if you haven\u2019t really thought boundaries through besides cheating, I would delve into that a bit. The way you have to mentally prepare, just suggests you don\u2019t really like it but trust in him and don\u2019t want to rock the boat.\nAlso BS on him saying he doesn\u2019t like it. Please girl no. There are other alternatives to a strip bar, and he\u2019s saying he doesn\u2019t want to come off as lame or whatever by not going with them & for saying he regrets  telling you the truth bc of how they see him. What?!?!?!!! Their opinion matters more to him than YOUR feelings and opinion of him. Yikes. Just\u2026. Take a few steps back and look at this as if it\u2019s a stranger and just observe.", "This has 90 day fianc\u00e9 vibes.", "Would you want the wives to tell you, if their husbands had told them not to?", "NTA. If you\u2019re not doing anything wrong you shouldn\u2019t need to lie.  They know they\u2019re doing some sleazy shit, which is why they want you complicit in their lie. A strip club is not an innocent fun time with the boys. There are only two things to do at a strip club: buy sex, or debase the staff. The first is cheating, and the second is sociopathic. Neither is a good look. If my partner was going to a strip club regularly with friends I would wonder what they were looking for there that I was not providing.", "Would you care about the lying if they had invited you also?", "Sneaking around is never a good thing and it\u2019s unfair that your husband has put you in this position", "INFO\n\n> I was upset I wasn\u2019t given notice **so I could adjust mentally**.\n\n.... wwhhhaat?", "He put you in a really unfair position, and I wouldn't feel comfortable.being an accomplice in his friends' marital betrayal or lies by omission. \n\nI would personally be side eyeing my husband. He doesn't sound like a good guy. Best believe his friends are dirtbags and will also help him lie to you.", "NTA  \n\n\nBut your husband is for asking you to lie. Also his reasoning is lame AF. If his friends wives are not ok with them going the strip club then that should be their issues not his.", "Umm. Just a thought, maybe he's afraid that if you rat out his friends to their wives the friends will rat him out to you. Sounds like they all hold each other's secrets.", "NTA this is his [friends] consequence, not yours. What should have happened is he should have asked you *first* and then not gone when you rightfully said you cannot lie for them. He\u2019s a huge asshole for attempting to isolate you in any way due to his failure.", "NTA. Given the circumstances, saying 'I've no intention of saying anything but I won't lie if I'm asked' is very, very reasonable on your part!\n\nThe fact that he doesn't think that's good enough raises red flags to me.", "So your husband is demanding you compromise your own morals or he will treat you with dishonesty? which means he is comfortable with the idea of lying to you. I don't know about you but I'd be wondering if he's actually been as honest with me as I thought he was. NTA", "Nta. You're not responsible for their lies.", "Nta.  You didn't fuck up their relationships. They did.", "NTA... You don't lie to your freinds and you don't let you husband maniputlate or bully you into lying. If you find he is lying to you, boot his sorry ass to the curb.", "NTA, \n\nI would be concerned now that he is going to go to strip clubs and not tell you in the future. \n\nAlso, I suppose just the thought of going to a strip club could make a wife say 100% no, but if they are doing nothing wrong why is it such a secret? Is more happening at the strip club that your husband or his friends don't want to admit to?", "NTA. Sounds like these boys don't need to be at the strip club, and need to find something else to do on boys night that doesn't involve lying to their wives and threatening multiple relationships. How is that worth it?! Your husband is the asshole for basically giving you the ultimatum to either lie to others or he will lie to you in the future. Your husband is a liar and so are his friends.", "I don't mean to sound alarmist or to provoke a conflict at all, and I don't believe your husband was gonna do anything that you wouldn't approve of - if he that in mind he wouldn't have said anything of course. However...\n\nWhy in the world, if nothing wrong at all was gonna go down there except looking, would her husband ask her to lie...? I'm not saying he gonna do anything shady.  I'm saying this is really weird. If not to cover up for his friends doing something potentially wrong, why would he say that?... sounds like someone feels at least a little guilty about something.\n\nOtherwise, why would he tell you in the first place? He could've just never relayed the message. Case shut.\n\nI'm no detective, but my gut feeling is at least one of them may potentially had something in mind other than... looking. I'm not saying going all the way or anything like that. Maybe his wife doesn't want him to go because she's super religious or something and he freaked out - but then why would your husband talk to you about this?...\n\nI'm just sayin'. NTA", "Haaahahhaa. Can\u2019t imagine being in a marriage like this. My wife would find out when I texted her a pic of me in the club :P\n\nNTA. Totally spineless move by him. But you guys seem a bit out of sync with each other with trust.", "NTA but equally MYOB. I wouldn\u2019t want someone telling my spouse something before me especially my friends spouse. A whole argument over something that isn\u2019t yours and a conversation that wouldn\u2019t likely come up organically.", "Soft YTA, because you are blowing this up from nothing, and rambling about imaginary betrayal. But really, sounds like the only real assholes are the other wives. Strip clubs  are not a betrayal, they are not cheating, and never could be considered such by any rational person.\n\nThe only betrayal would be if you told these unhinged psychopath wives something you were essentially told in confidence. \n\nShould this be the case, absolutely not. These guys should have picked mentally stable partners who aren't controlling assholes, but they chose to stick their dicks in  crazy.\n\nThere are crazy dudes out there who would abuse their partners if they found out they spoke to another man, and you wouldn't tell those violent assholes something perfectly innocent that would cause problems for the partner. This is no different.", "NTA - Your husband is a liar. Going to a strip club is such a small thing that it makes those men stupid for being so conniving. In fact, your husband is doing you a favor by keeping you separate from his friends and their wives because they all sound incredibly immature. I\u2019d watch my husband if I were you.", "Hey real friends would tell", "NTA and it\u2019s really sketchy they\u2019re wanting you to hide it from their wives.", "Adjust mentally?", "NTA. Tell them anyway, if you can.", "Well. This is a very sticky wicket.\n\nIf I was your husband my takeaway from this would be that I can't trust you (and I'm not saying I wouldn't be the asshole for that, but I gotta call it how it is).\n\nYou're NTA here, you're well within your right to not want to keep secrets from friends, but I don't feel like your husband is either, he did the right by you and now it feels like you're making this about yourself when it isn't about you, and I would take issue with my wife in this scenario. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nVery sticky wicket indeed.", "NTA....", "NTA, I would have told their wives but structured it like this:\n\n\"I was instructed to say, 'No they did not go to a strip club' \"\n\nThat way you didn't lie to them about anything. It's up to their interpretation of what they want to do with that sentence.", "NTA. Your solution was perfectly reasonable. I wouldn't want to immediately spill the beans either, and I also would not be comfortable lying about it if asked.\n\nThis is why it's a bad idea for married men to decide to go to a strip club on a whim. If you have to lie about it, you probably shouldn't be doing it. I'm sure a lot of men don't think going to a strip club is as big a deal as their wives would. That's a fine reason to not go, really. It's a big hassle to either lie or argue about it, and you're not missing out on that much.", "NTA. This is ridiculous. \n\nThey shouldn\u2019t be breaking boundaries and they vertically shouldn\u2019t expect you to be an accomplice in it by lying to cover their butts. \n\nAnd your husband shouldn\u2019t expect you to compromise *your* integrity because they comprised their own.", "Innocent people don\u2019t lie or ask others to lie. I\u2019d bet money that one or both \u201cfriends\u201d have a history of cheating and one or both got sexual favors at the strip club. Which is why they don\u2019t want the wives to know.\n\nThere\u2019s an old saying, show me who your friends are and you show me who you are.\n\nIf the husband is telling you to lie for them, it makes me wonder if they have something on him which they would tell you if you didn\u2019t lie. And since your husband goes to strip clubs, I hope you had a very clear conversation with him about boundaries and expectations about behavior. Meanwhile, next time you\u2019re at the doctor get an STI screen.\n\nHugs.", "And if he is expecting you to lie just imagine how many secrets the other wives know and keep from you about your husband.", "ask your husband what those friends wives has had to lie to you about!", "Lol all this for a strip club? I think there are underlying issues here unrelated to the strip club. How these fellas view their partners and partnerships, and your husband enabling deceit, is a pretty big red flag.\n\nI\u2019m a fan of everyone can do what they want in a relationship as long as it\u2019s *consensual*.

He isn't just an innocent bystander that's she's bringing the hammer down on, he was totally fine forcing his wife to lie to his family & the wife of his best friend.

They are responsible for their actions.", "If your husband can\u2019t tell you something without keeping it within your marriage, then know he fully cannot trust you. \n\nRegardless of how it makes you feel. I would look at my wife differently.", "Info: what type of strip club is this exactly? I have been to two types. One where it was strictly girls dancing on stage, and second one where girls dance on stage but also have essentially escort services right there at the club and for a low price of like $80, according to a friend, you can get a lap dance and touch boobs and ass. So I would need to know what type of strip club they are going to for my decision. If the first then just let it go, men don't really care to stare at naked women we have all seen it and it is probably just a place to grab a drink. If it is the second then I would definitely be questioning what the heck they were doing there but still would probably stay out of it and give them a warning.", "You are NTA. What should concern you is that your husband would want you to lie. If he wants you to lie so his friends don\u2019t get in trouble. What are they lying for him about. What is he keeping from you?

Your husband is wrong to ask you to lie should you be asked whether it's true their husbands went to a strip club.", "All you should be saying is that you won\u2019t say anything, however you won\u2019t lie if asked.\n\nWhich you have.\n\nNTA", "Did he ever cheat on you? Does he actually listen to any of your boundries or what makes you comfortable?\nBecause if he threatens and tries to manipulate you into lying about his married freinds lives to their wives, what does that say about what he does behind your back?

But maybe to yourself if you keep being with someone like this", "NTA.  You compromised.  I don't think them going is a big deal... but I've been a few times and my bf isn't a fan, so maybe it just doesn't bother me.  But I wouldn't agree to lie if directly asked either.  Secrecy like that between spouses just makes me kinda sad.  Glad your hubby told you.  Give him props for that anyway!;)", "So he wants to help his friends hide shady behavior from their wives?

The fact he\u2019s trying to manipulate you now by saying he should just lie says everything. How do you trust a liar?", "Those friends sound sketchy. If they know their wives are uncomfortable with something then why are they going? And it\u2019s shitty if you to have to hold the secret?

It's a boys night out. No stress for anyone then.", "YTA. While this is definitely a dilemma of morals, I think this would specifically fall under marital discretion. Your husband is open with you about many things. So, when you told him you would not lie openly, that damaged trust, regardless of whether it's right or wrong. You both are a single unit; you back each other up and look out for each other's best interests. In this case, would you be morally right to say something to his buddies' wives? Perhaps. But you're potentially destroying his friendships. Ultimately, your number one priority should always be your marriage, nothing else.

They are people I care about. \n\nI do not care if my husband goes to a strip club. I\u2019m not upset he went although I was upset I wasn\u2019t given notice so I could adjust mentally. My husband swears it was a last minute decision which I can accept and get over. I knew about it the night of. \n\nHe texted me and told me not to tell the wives. This is where I became upset. I had no intentions of running off to say anything to them but now knowing they\u2019d both be upset is different. I knew 1 likely wouldn\u2019t approve but wasn\u2019t going to inquire to find out for sure. I was surprised about the other wife as I know her husband has gone to strip clubs in the past and once we had all planned to go to a strip club together with another friend but plans didn\u2019t work out. \n\nI initially refused altogether but attempted to compromise with my husband that unless I\u2019m asked specifically I won\u2019t say anything. I can\u2019t actually imagine a scenario where they\u2019d ask me specifically. My husband stated that unless I agree to lie he cannot have me around them at all and won\u2019t invite them over or go over with me. While I consider them friends, they\u2019re all through my husband and aren\u2019t people I usually hang out with without my husband. 1 lives a few hours away. The local one we have hung out a few times without our husbands but it\u2019s rare. It\u2019s almost always a family event with all our kids. Situations I\u2019d be sad to lose. \n\nMy husbands concern is they\u2019ll never want to hang out with him if he causes problems in their relationship and now regrets telling me. Which is a new argument for us because finding out later would be a betrayal to me. \n\nSo AITA if I don\u2019t agree to lie if they ask me specifically?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You don\u2019t have the god given authority to force people to tell the truth. Fascist tendencies aren\u2019t okay just because you happen to be in the right.", "Why does she get to make that choice for him? \n\nDo you not see how infantilizing it is to make decisions for other people? She\u2019s his wife, not his mom.\n\nHe split the difference between being a completely shitty person and being a good person. He was honest with his wife even though he\u2019s covering for his friends. Instead of getting a tiny bit of credit, he\u2019s getting piled on for not being a completely good person. \n\nThis is a classic case of give an inch and they ask for a mile. He gave the inch by being honest with his own wife, now she wants a mile by asking him to be honest with his friends\u2019 wives. This is definitely a no win situation for him.", "But his wife is fine with it, and he can be honest about it, with her. \n\nNow he somehow is responsible to go around and check that every single one of his friends\u2019 wives are also okay with it? Is he the group\u2019s dad or something? \u201cDid everyone remember to check with their wife before we go party?\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re really telling me you think that\u2019s a natural and normal adult interaction?", "I would feel uncomfortable with it, and I\u2019d encourage my wife to share the truth. But I wouldn\u2019t take matters into my own hands since I have no right to do that with information that isn\u2019t mine. At the end of the day, it\u2019s her choice. \n\nAnd yeah, I might be upset with my partner for not telling the truth. But I\u2019m not going to give her an ultimatum or try to force her hand. The same way I might try to encourage her not to play slot machines at a casino, but once she decides she\u2019s going to anyway, I get out of her way. It\u2019s not my right to force her to do what I think is right. Just to gently tell her, and without nagging.", "Well I don\u2019t but since I don\u2019t know that they did I\u2019m not going to make any unnecessary assumptions or ask questions I don\u2019t want to know the answer to. Actively knowing someone did something is different than knowing there\u2019s the possibility they might have done it.", "You must be exhausted with all the mental gymnastics you are doing. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f We get it.
