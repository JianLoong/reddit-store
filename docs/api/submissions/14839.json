We\u2019ve been operating for around 25 years. My parents (both 64) are at the top managing everything, my brother (37M) is in charge of sales and I\u2019m (23F) in charge of marketing and social media. I\u2019ve been working here for about 3 years, but I\u2019m leaving to work in my desired field. So, my brother\u2019s wife (38F, Kate), who is done with her maternity leave, is coming to replace me. (I think her last job was at a bank, almost 6 years ago) I\u2019ve taught her some things, like how to use photoshop, canva, how to manage our website etc. \n\nI\u2019m not very close to her, it can be awkward at times. One thing you should know about her is that she is very sensitive and gets offended at the littlest things. My mom corrects her about a something, she goes and complains to my brother. Brother gets angry at us. It\u2019s not just work related stuff, I once commented about how my nephew doesn\u2019t say thank you at all, but she interpreted it as me saying that she was a bad mom and again complained to my brother later on. She always takes things way out of proportion and creates a false narrative in her head. \n\nIn the last 3 months, I went abroad to study. Before going I prepared 3 months worth of ad/poster/post etc for social media and handed it to Kate. This means she had 3 months to improve her graphic design skills. I came back from my studies, but I don\u2019t work with my family anymore. I do help with some social media stuff here and there, but not full time. \nKate posted her own poster for the first time last week. She didn\u2019t consult with anyone and as soon as I saw her post on instagram, I emailed her a template I made in 10 minutes to show her how it can be improved. Her design was very low quality and just very different from our brand. I thought I was being helpful by providing her with a ready to use design. \n\nLater that day, my brother messaged me that his wife is upset and has been crying all evening. I was confused, what was there to be upset about? I didn\u2019t say her design was bad to her face, besides this was her job you\u2019re meant to accept criticism. Then the argument escalated and I told him that his wife is toxic and manipulative who uses her tears to get him on her side. I haven\u2019t been talking to them since. It was such an unnecessary discourse, everyone I\u2019ve talked to has been on my side, but I\u2019m not sure. Was I out of line sending her that email?", "created_utc": 1681541397, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mt599/aita_for_sending_an_improved_version_of_a_poster/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like another poster said it\u2019s not your job anymore. Let them make their own mistakes.", "NTA but you could have approached it differently. If you don\u2019t work there your not her boss. Give the template to your parents that way they can decide if they like her work or if they want her to follow the template. \nIt all sounds like a recipe for disaster that you won\u2019t be a part of.

Who is her manager?  Are you her manager?  If your family wanted a graphic designer, why are you hiring someone whose expertise is in banking?\n\nIt kind of sounds like it\u2019s been set up that she will fail, which isn\u2019t awesome.", "Info: was it an improved poster or was it a generic template? Have you ever sent such a product to anyone else at a company you don\u2019t work for to improve their work?\n\nEsh.

You because it isn\u2019t your place to do so anymore.", "ESH\n\nYour sister for taking a job she isn't qualified for and refusing to accept feedback and learn. And for using her husband as a shield. Your brother for allowing his wife to use him to fight battles that shouldn't exist. And you for giving feedback when it was no longer any of your business. You don't work there anymore. You need to let it go.\n\n>a template I made in 10 minutes to show her how it can be improved\n\nThis line is where you showed your hand. Part of your motivation was to show off. Not cool since you aren't her manager.", "I was leaning ESH but if you take out the personal stuff, YTA at the core of this situation for the question you asked.\n\nI'm in the same job area as you and when I left my last place, I also left 3 months of posts to give them enough time to hire and on-board someone. I get when you're the one who built a brand image and put strategy in place it can feel bad to see it dismissed (especially when engagement was high as a result) but it isn't your job. You left the job. On her very first project, you sent her a replacement which 100% screams \"I think yours is bad\". You don't have to explicitly say it. Let it go, let her do what she is doing, and if her employers are not happy, they can raise it with her. You are not her manager or colleague.", "NTA - marketing is such a crucial part of any business. You're better off off washing your hands off the role since you've already handed it to her", "ESH. You should have had a process in place to pass on your templates before you left, and this was the wrong way to offer advice. When you handed over the designs, did you include instructions on how to replicate them in future? Or did you just expect her to learn from looking at your past work? Canva is pretty easy, but Photoshop is a massive programme to learn in a few months. \n\nShe is clearly insecure in her role, and probably feels intimidated by you, but if she can't do the job, or take advice, she should find another career.", "YTA. It's her job now. Stop nitpicking. If you wanted to design the posters, you should have stayed.", "It sounds like you know that your sister-in-law has some problems and she probably needs some counseling. That being said you left that job and it's her job now. It seems to me that it's not your place to say anything anymore. Also it's probably better to just not allow your brother to be in the middle and tell him that if she has a problem with you she needs to tell you herself.\n\nAlternate conversation with brother:\nBro - Hey my wife's been crying all night\nYou - wow that's crazy\nBro - she's upset because you did XYZ\nYou - oh okay well if she's bothered by anything that I do she can feel free to call me herself.\n\nIt's pretty obvious that this is not a situation that either one of you could fix I think keeping your conversation with your brother focused on that fact might be more helpful. Esh", "NTA. Your SIL.is useless and it\u2019s really not your problem anymore. I\u2019m sure your parents know her limitations. What you did was an act of help out of concern for the family business but as you no longer work there, let it go.", "YTA the reasons were very well explained by /u/ACatGod\n\nBut I still want to add something about this line\n\n>I once commented about how my nephew doesn\u2019t say thank you at all, but she interpreted it as me saying that she was a bad mom\n\nYou are critizing your young nephew's behavior, of course is this an attack on his parents. If you wanted to support your nephew you would have explained it to him privately and remind him when he is not doing it. Just from this line I can imagine you making a lot of small comments to feel other people bad", "YTA \n\nI understand where your coming from, marketing  does have to be able to receive criticism. And she probably shouldn\u2019t be working a job like that if she\u2019s as touchy as you say. \n\nBut I think the problem is you don\u2019t work there anymore, so you don\u2019t really have a right to be the person who gives the criticism. If you were overly worried you could have told your parents who actually are in a place to give that.\n\nAlso you know that she\u2019s sensitive about things, so why aren\u2019t you more tactful with how you go about things? You could have said \u2018I saw your poster, it looked good. Let me know if you ever want my help with something more complex\u2019. You might not have said that it was bad to her face but you\u2019ve told us that that\u2019s what you thought- so even if you didn\u2019t mean it, that\u2019s the intention she\u2019s seeing. \n\nYou then doubled down by calling her toxic for expressing her feelings to her own husband? That\u2019s where you really crossed the line. \n\nTl;dr:\nYes she\u2019s too sensitive for your old job, but it isn\u2019t your job anymore so its not really your place to criticise. It might be an idea to start talking more tactfully around her.", "YTA sending the template is a passive aggressive way of saying your work is shit, stick to what I do. You could be more helpful and send her tutorial suggestions or get the family business to actually invest in some training for her. You are all family and understand how you communicate with each other, you most likely don't even realise how curt you come across to someone new to this dynamic.", "YTA You don't work there anymore and once she learns job will have different style then you. Key is that she needs to learn. \n\nAnd ultimately if the business suffer during that time your parents needs to step in an say something. Also i would just sit down with her and your brother and explain difference between constructive criticism and criticism. It won't hurt if you try and better the relationship and give her a option to ask you questions about the job. But you can't really expect her to be like you, everyone is different and she doesn't have any background in this", "NTA ... You sister in law is a piece of work tho. I honestly don't understand how she can function in society. \n\nSend a message to SIl and tell her to stop being such a child.", "NTA she sounds like an adult baby", "NTA - she is 38 and unable,to take ANY feedback. She immediately,goes into the worst case intentions by Op? Your brother better wake up and start acting like a boss or he won\u2019t have a business left after your parents retire, which is very soon. His wife is not the right person to be in business with him.", "Whooooah yeah OMG, YTA. You are so much TA you don't even realize how utterly poisonous you sound.\n\nTake a huge step back with your nitpicky, petty ass self, and learn to treat people like human beings, and recognize when you're in the wrong.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are LEAVING.

You got that wrong: YOU are the toxic AH here.", "YTA - I was more or less on your side until you said you called his wife toxic and manipulative. She's highly sensitive to criticism, and that's ultimately her problem. But it doesn't make her toxic or manipulative.\n\nAlso - why not be more vocally supportive and encouraging of her *very first* project at this new job she's taken over from you?Catch more flies with honey and all that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes, because it is her job and she's doing poorly.

There is no winning in this scenario. \n\nUnfortunately the family business will start to decline but that is between your brother and his wife now.

You're downplaying your own assholishness. \n\n\"My mom corrects her about a something, she goes and complains to my brother.\" \n\nI wouldn't want my MIL correcting me either.

It just lead to more stress and strife within your family. Sorry, but you\u2019re best best is to apologise - tell both your SIL & Brother- you\u2019re sorry, it was truly meant to be helpful but unfortunately it didn\u2019t come across that way.

Marketing was the only available position at the time", "Agreed. Saying \"in 10 minutes\" really insinuates her thoughts it was very basic and the SIL couldn't even manage that.\n\nGraphic design isn't learned from scratch in 3 months. Give her a break. You were in the job 3 years, of course replicating the same type of design you've always done will take you only 10 minutes.", "Excellent point as well. I particularly feel this, as having just spent a very difficult weekend with a sibling whose parenting has resulted in two close to teenage children behaving in ways which you'd associate with children half their age, I said nothing. My sibling's parenting is not for me to comment on. I have some clear boundaries about them coming into my home and what I personally will accept, but in terms of the general behaviours it's not my place to say anything. Just because something isn't right it doesn't mean the best solution is for you to wade in and give an opinion. If my sibling asks, I will give an honest view, but they are not asking for opinions.", "I\u2019m sorry, WHAT!? How on earth is OP TA?\n\nOP sent an email to help out SIL, because let\u2019s be real, if she can\u2019t do this job at some point she\u2019ll probably be fired right? So she helped her out and she went crying to her husband because she can\u2019t take criticism? OP is not TA.", "I love that people think that marketing is so easy anyone can do it. Some people are just not naturally inclined to communications. You could mention to your parents some training and marketing courses if they care about their brand at all but would otherwise keep your nose out of it. Honestly baffling that they don\u2019t hand this woman some finance related work.", "It sounds like a job without any real training or chain of command.  You\u2019re not individually wrong to do what you did, but the workplace dynamic sounds like the AH here", "YTA. This isn't your job anymore and you don't work there anymore. You saw something on social media and took it upon yourself unasked to send her feedback on her work and correct her. It's not your place to do that. If you took out the fact this is a family business, I think you'd see much more clearly how inappropriate and condescending it is for someone who left a role to come back six months later and tell the new person in that role how badly they're doing their job. \n\nIf you truly had concerns you should have taken it up with her manager and let them deal with it. \n\nAITA is terrible when it comes to work place behaviours, but what you did was unprofessional and unkind. Family businesses fail because the family members can't maintain professional boundaries and behaviours in the workplace."]}
