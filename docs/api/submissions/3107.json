A few more choice words and she hung up. I spoke to my son about Alex\u2019s vegetarianism to see how strict his diet is but my son didn\u2019t even realise Alex was vegetarian so I\u2019m wondering if Alex knows he is vegetarian?

If this was about a dietary requirement for health issues or religious reasons (neither if which are mentioned) I think letting him have the meat pie would be problematic. As its a morality judgement then there's a point where the kid need to understand what the moral cause his parents are signed up to and the lifestyle choices this results in. Kid needs educating.

So yes, you probably should have stopped him from eating the pie. However, at 10 years old Alex should have a general understanding of his own dietary restrictions and it sounds like his mom is just expecting everyone to manage it for him.

Based on your edit he should known but there is no harm in offering a reminder if you put similar looking good out as well.\n\nThe mother needs to chill, sure you can argue she was concerned for her kid but her reaction was a bit over the top. Eating meat unless he is allergic won\u2019t kill the kid", "This one is tough and interesting to me. \n\nOn the one hand, you asked about allergies and we\u2019re informed that the kid is a vegetarian. That suggests that you would actually follow up and ensure that he would be directed to the vegetarian food options and/or stop him from eating meat accidentally.\n\nOn the other hand, he\u2019s not a toddler. At 10 years old he\u2019s old enough to have developed food preferences and to know whether or not something he ate had meat in it. \n\nI suspect that he knows he\u2019s a vegetarian (contrary to other posters) but doesn\u2019t particularly want to be, which is why he told his mom that he ate a meat pie (and probably that he enjoyed it). I further suspect that mom is pushing the vegetarian lifestyle, which is why she was upset. \n\nThat said, I\u2019m stuck on the fact that you saw him eating the meat pie and didn\u2019t say anything. Having reasoned this out for myself, I feel like you should have at least pulled him aside to gently point out that there was meat in the pie. If he kept eating it after that, well you tried. \n\nI think I have to give you a gentle YTA but really I think the kid wanted to eat meat and probably would have done it anyway, which obviously isn\u2019t your fault.", "YTA for letting him eat it. You can serve whatever you want at the party, veggie mom cannot dictate that! But you should have told him that it was meat as soon as you saw he was eating it. And you should have told the mother afterwards and apologised. \n\nYou're assuming he was paying attention when you said what the food was, and he either made a choice to eat meat, or he doesn't know he's vegetarian. Those seem like bold assumptions when \"he didn't hear me\" is also on the table!", "I have a few questions, if you were fixing food for the kids, why didn't you tell them not to eat until you were able to fix their food? Secondly, why weren't you the one to tell his mother, instead of the child, you knew he wasn't supposed to have meat, and it was a mistake. So that was a mistake on your part, that child was in your care, and you just acted like Oh, well.\n\nWhen you have other people's children in your care you are responsible for their wellbeing, and safety.
