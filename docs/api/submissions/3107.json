So yes, you probably should have stopped him from eating the pie. However, at 10 years old Alex should have a general understanding of his own dietary restrictions and it sounds like his mom is just expecting everyone to manage it for him.

Based on your edit he should known but there is no harm in offering a reminder if you put similar looking good out as well.\n\nThe mother needs to chill, sure you can argue she was concerned for her kid but her reaction was a bit over the top. Eating meat unless he is allergic won\u2019t kill the kid", "This one is tough and interesting to me. \n\nOn the one hand, you asked about allergies and we\u2019re informed that the kid is a vegetarian. That suggests that you would actually follow up and ensure that he would be directed to the vegetarian food options and/or stop him from eating meat accidentally.\n\nOn the other hand, he\u2019s not a toddler. At 10 years old he\u2019s old enough to have developed food preferences and to know whether or not something he ate had meat in it. \n\nI suspect that he knows he\u2019s a vegetarian (contrary to other posters) but doesn\u2019t particularly want to be, which is why he told his mom that he ate a meat pie (and probably that he enjoyed it). I further suspect that mom is pushing the vegetarian lifestyle, which is why she was upset. \n\nThat said, I\u2019m stuck on the fact that you saw him eating the meat pie and didn\u2019t say anything. Having reasoned this out for myself, I feel like you should have at least pulled him aside to gently point out that there was meat in the pie. If he kept eating it after that, well you tried. \n\nI think I have to give you a gentle YTA but really I think the kid wanted to eat meat and probably would have done it anyway, which obviously isn\u2019t your fault.", "YTA for letting him eat it. You can serve whatever you want at the party, veggie mom cannot dictate that! But you should have told him that it was meat as soon as you saw he was eating it. And you should have told the mother afterwards and apologised. \n\nYou're assuming he was paying attention when you said what the food was, and he either made a choice to eat meat, or he doesn't know he's vegetarian. Those seem like bold assumptions when \"he didn't hear me\" is also on the table!", "I have a few questions, if you were fixing food for the kids, why didn't you tell them not to eat until you were able to fix their food? Secondly, why weren't you the one to tell his mother, instead of the child, you knew he wasn't supposed to have meat, and it was a mistake. So that was a mistake on your part, that child was in your care, and you just acted like Oh, well.\n\nWhen you have other people's children in your care you are responsible for their wellbeing, and safety.

Absolutely not the asshole and if you want to pull out the petty you can request that mom specifically serve food that serves your child\u2019s diet (meat) at the next sleepover/party they host \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f not a mom but that\u2019s what I would do", "Could have slipped, could have been trying to not so subtly hint that he doesn\u2019t want to be vegetarian. Could have been just being a defiant pre-teen. It just seems\u2026 weird that a 10 year old could accidentally eat meat without realizing it, and eat it if he actually wanted to be a vegetarian.", "OP Says:    \n\n\n> I spoke to my son about Alex\u2019s vegetarianism to see how strict his diet is but my son didn\u2019t even realise Alex was vegetarian so I\u2019m wondering if Alex knows he is vegetarian?\n\nMaybe Alex really doesn't know he's Vegetarian.  I mean the food at his home is still just called \"food\" not \"vegetarian food.\"    \n\n\nBut that's on Alex's mother. Her son is old enough to be taught what he should and should not serve onto his own plate.", "Because he's either too young to be sly or is trying to protest her outright", "That generally because of the proteins - if you go too long without eating high protein food, suddenly reintroducing it to your diet can upset your digestive system", "I think it's more a mental rather than physical thing, and like OP said kid grabbed it was eating it and if she took it away he would've gotten shit from the other kids.", "Yep just parents that are passing their beliefs onto him.", "OP told him that those pies were meat. And he told his mom, so he clearly knew", "OP told the kids what each dish was.", "Meat pies in Australia are very obviously meat.", "At 10? Nah, he knew. OP told the kids what each dish was so Alex did know. And OP's son not even knowing Alex was vegetarian? That just screams to me that Alex is only vegetarian when mom is controlling his food, but isn't actually vegetarian himself.", "That\u2019s actually really good info thank you. I kinda figured it was psychological but I didn\u2019t know", "No. Your gut can absolutely adjust to how it handles and breaks down certain foods and additives. Like people who don't eat a lot of veggies get the shits after incorporating good fiber in their diet. They are used to 20 minute poops when it shouldn't take that long.\n\nPeople who haven't eaten meat regularly go through the same process. It is a rude adjustment to the system. It isn't necessarily harmful, but it can definitely be unpleasant.", "I'm talking about indigestion. And yes, they can get that. I can get that if I'm not used to digesting something.", "I vomited both times I ate meat. My sister projectile vomited after she was given a meatball. But, sure total myth.", "They don't have to discuss it for the son to know. If Alex was vegetarian, he would have denied meat offered at school/by his friends, and would've always asked to make sure no food has meat (as a vegetarian, i can say this from personal experience and from what I've seen people around me do)", "[removed]", "[removed]", "This is exactly what I thought. Looks like it\u2019s mom\u2019s choice, not the kid\u2019s", "Could have picked it up and realised it was meat part way through and felt like he needed to be polite and finish his meal. There are lots of options. \n\nWith the amount of meat replacement products in the world, which are generally trying to recreate the taste and texture of meat, I don't think its weird at all that a kid could eat something without immediately realising it's meat.", "Or Alex isn't vegetarian and doesn't agree with the idea of not eating meat. A 10 year old is more than old enough to form their own beliefs about food and know what they like and hate. \n\nBeing vegetarian is a personal choice, having one's diet controlled by a vegetarian isn't. Just because his mom is one doesn't mean he's one.", "Or maybe her son is a clueless 10 year old. \n\nOP took that responsibility on when she asked what food he was allowed. It's on OP.", "Or he told her because he didn't mean to eat it, and he shared with her because he likes her. The only option the parent-hating, meat-loving masses on AITA haven't considered!", "Super interesting thank you. :) I suspect if the son never knew kid was vegetarian, perhaps he\u2019s not following this at school\u2026", ">if she took it away he would've gotten shit from the other kids.\n\nWould he?!", "I knew my vegetarian kid ate something with meat in because he said his wrap was quite chewy. Another kid could have told him. He could have noticed partway through and been embarrassed, just as OP was. He could have realised afterwards because it made him feel weird and he described the food to his mum.", "She said she announced the food as it was being put on the table. Do you think every one of those 10 year old boys at a party sat in silence and focused on her descriptions?", "They don't have meat replacement versions of meat pies in Aus? Meat pies are very obcisly meat pies in the UK too, but fake meat pies look almost identical.", "Yes. It's truly a psychological thing. And I think some hardline parents tell their kids this to get compliance. Humans, whether they be eat everything, vegetarian or vegan... Can eat anything edible, as long as they aren't allergic.", "If you say so... There's no scientific evidence for it. We all get indigestion from various foods. Darn nuts give me indigestion! But i love them \ud83d\ude00", "\u2026was this a meat pie joke? Here?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

People are shit and anything different is picked on.", "All these subjunctive options don\u2019t discount the fact that she told the kids in advance which pies were which. So he probably took that pie intentionally. \n\nI realize that kids are kids and need to be watched, but this boy is 10, not a toddler. If he\u2019s on a strict diet, it\u2019s up to the parents to enforce the rules and make sure he clearly knows what he should or shouldn\u2019t eat.  OP could have walked in 5 minutes earlier or noticed what he was eating. It\u2019s very entitled to expect that meat would not be served at all.", "I think they would perk their ears up at the name of tasty food. If I heard \"meat pie\" as a 10 year old, I would go for it without a second thought. \n\nAnd at 10? A kid knows what they know is tasty or not and knows whether they enjoy meat. 10 year olds are not dumb.", "I find it doubtful a 10 year old in Australia is unaware that party pies contain meat.", "Then that\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault regardless.", "They are really not widespread, and are expensive.", "And if you were 10 years old in my home, I'd be sure to let you know what had nuts in it. LOL", "If they'll pick on *anything*, then it doesn't matter if she says something to him. They'll pick on him for something else in 5 minutes, and move on to another friend before that. Either everything is an excuse for being picked on, and therefore this wouldn't be a major piece of ammo, or not everything is an excuse for picking on people, and they wouldn't care, because being vegetarian is pretty normal to a lot of kids.", "You are assuming that he was listening to the description.\n\nI definitely agree that it was fine to serve meat, I said as much in my judgement. I disagree that *once she realised* she should have just let the kid carry on, not mentioning it to him. And not mentioning it to his mother. That's why she's an AH. By asking his food preferences, she made an agreement to monitor his food. She failed at that.", "It is if she told the parent of said child that she would cater to his dietary rules.", "And do we know for sure that they're in Australia? Or are you just assuming because they served meat pies?", "Anything different!! Not saying different isn't good it's great but those little semen demons are fuckin assholes.", "And she did. Do you expect her to spoon feed a 10 yr old?", "I mean, I hear you. But I also think that people decide these things, and say them with conviction, and they aren't always right. I have a weird ass name, never once got bullied for it. I got bullied for being fat, and got jokes about my glasses, and other things, but never about my super unusual name. So it's not like I was so hot and popular that they decided to let my weird name go, they just didn't care. And never once was my vegetarianism commented on (well, once, when a guy we making jokes about finding me a sausage I would like to eat... But that was closer to aggressive \"flirting\" than bullying).", "No I expect her to make sure that the vegetarian heard, and knows what they can eat (not just announcing it to the chatty table). And to tell him when she saw him eating meat. And to tell his mother.", "So I agree it might or might not have happened, but let the kid eat.", "Or let the kid know that he doesn't have to eat it. And shouldn't be eating it. It may have been that he took it, bit into it, realised it was meat and ate it because he felt like he had to be polite. It may be that he loves meat, and eats it any chance he gets (somewhat doubtful, as he told his mom). Give the kid the information, allow him to make informed choices."]}
