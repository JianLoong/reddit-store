If you had taken it away from the vegetarian kid and forced him to eat the non-meat options, that would be treating him differently than the other kids.

If this was about a dietary requirement for health issues or religious reasons (neither if which are mentioned) I think letting him have the meat pie would be problematic. As its a morality judgement then there's a point where the kid need to understand what the moral cause his parents are signed up to and the lifestyle choices this results in. Kid needs educating.

This is a different scenario but my muslim friend in college would go to the bar with us and he'd end up eating 3 giant BLT's.

However, at 10 years old Alex should have a general understanding of his own dietary restrictions and it sounds like his mom is just expecting everyone to manage it for him. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect someone alter the entire menu of an event for one person (unless it\u2019s some kind of deathly allergy).", "ESH.

She shouldn\u2019t have assumed that and you shouldn\u2019t have assumed that he would just know what he could have.", "YTA.

Based on your edit he should known but there is no harm in offering a reminder if you put similar looking good out as well.\n\nThe mother needs to chill, sure you can argue she was concerned for her kid but her reaction was a bit over the top. Eating meat unless he is allergic won\u2019t kill the kid", "This one is tough and interesting to me. \n\nOn the one hand, you asked about allergies and we\u2019re informed that the kid is a vegetarian. That suggests that you would actually follow up and ensure that he would be directed to the vegetarian food options and/or stop him from eating meat accidentally.\n\nOn the other hand, he\u2019s not a toddler. At 10 years old he\u2019s old enough to have developed food preferences and to know whether or not something he ate had meat in it. \n\nI suspect that he knows he\u2019s a vegetarian (contrary to other posters) but doesn\u2019t particularly want to be, which is why he told his mom that he ate a meat pie (and probably that he enjoyed it). I further suspect that mom is pushing the vegetarian lifestyle, which is why she was upset. \n\nThat said, I\u2019m stuck on the fact that you saw him eating the meat pie and didn\u2019t say anything. Having reasoned this out for myself, I feel like you should have at least pulled him aside to gently point out that there was meat in the pie. If he kept eating it after that, well you tried. \n\nI think I have to give you a gentle YTA but really I think the kid wanted to eat meat and probably would have done it anyway, which obviously isn\u2019t your fault.", "YTA for letting him eat it. You can serve whatever you want at the party, veggie mom cannot dictate that! But you should have told him that it was meat as soon as you saw he was eating it. And you should have told the mother afterwards and apologised. \n\nYou're assuming he was paying attention when you said what the food was, and he either made a choice to eat meat, or he doesn't know he's vegetarian. Those seem like bold assumptions when \"he didn't hear me\" is also on the table!", "I have a few questions, if you were fixing food for the kids, why didn't you tell them not to eat until you were able to fix their food? Secondly, why weren't you the one to tell his mother, instead of the child, you knew he wasn't supposed to have meat, and it was a mistake. So that was a mistake on your part, that child was in your care, and you just acted like Oh, well.\n\nWhen you have other people's children in your care you are responsible for their wellbeing, and safety.

And as you move further away from food, people have less familiarity with it, so persistent myths become more common. So, lots of people have strong ideological reasons to minimize the contribution of animals to their lives, and they may feel as strongly about eliminating that from their children\u2019s lives as well because they see that as part of their responsibility.

Your decision to not stop him from eating *more* after the fact is frankly a secondary concern.\n\nFinally, if this is a religious restriction (it sounds like you're in the UK), then the whole conversation is much more serious and you're much more squarely in the wrong due to the relative severity of your screwup.", "You had me in the first half\u2026 \ud83d\ude02", "Ok now you've made me hungry for bacon after eating Thanksgiving food all day.", "Or he does eat meat regularly just without Mommy knowing.  If he wants to eat meat then she shouldn't force her eating habits onto him.  I don't care if you say it's her beliefs that doesn't mean they are his.", "Wanna bet OP's kid wasn't aware of this kid's food restrictions because he eats meat in school lunches all the time?", "I was vegetarian for 5 years first time I ate a slice of pepperoni pizza I thought I was dying. \n\nKids definitely sneaking meat", ">Eh, that cuts both ways. I was a meat eater because that\u2019s what my parents fed me.\n\nSimilar. Not the same, as when your parents feed you meat, they don't restrict your diet, while veganism or vegetarianism does.", "Oh the joy of forbidden fruit, or should I say  meat?!", "For a long time growing up I couldn't figure out how my mom *knew* whenever I broke the rules.  I then mentioned it to my dad (they're divorced) and he said she just makes a lot of accusations and I only look guilty when she lands and I am too stressed by the guilt that I don't notice all the wrong accusations (same tactic most fake 'psychics' use by the way). Clever! I started denying everything after that and realized he was right. \n\nPoint is, if his mom employs the same tactic he didn't *mean* to tell.", "That what you get when they force her to be vegan from young age, it is not her choice", "Yep, I was vegetarian for years and was able to eat meat with no issues when I restarted", "This is completely a case of my values are my values and your values are your values. I shouldn\u2019t force mine on you provided that what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t harming yourself or someone else.", "NTA, her son chose to reject her religion. It\u2019s not your duty to enforce her faith. Alex probably enjoyed the (literal) tasted of freedom!", "To add to this. Some kids eat the way they want to when their parents are out of sight. Alex may very well enjoy meat and may not have been involved in the decision to be a vegetarian. NTA.", "Sounds like the mom is vegetarian, not the kid  \n\n\nNTA.", "Total diversion: my aunt was classmates at a boarding school with the governor's daughter.  She got invited to the governor's home for a weekend and accepted.  Afterwards my grandmother (a snob) asked my aunt what had been served for the meals.  When my aunt mentioned that turnips had been served as part of a dinner, my grandmother sniffed and said, \"poor people eat turnips.\"  \n\nAbsolutely no shortage of summary judgments in my family.", "Exactly! Both my brother and cousin accidentally went vegetarian (they both lived in flats where their flat mates were all vegetarian). My cousin got really sick after eating meat for the first time in a while, my brother didn\u2019t have any problems. It comes down to far more complicated biological processes than I care to understand lol. I personally couldn\u2019t be vegetarian because I\u2019m chronically anemic - I rely on my meat intake to help keep my iron levels up", "My children think every meal should be candy and that I\u2019m denying them by not doing so. By your logic, I\u2019m abusing my children? Hmm.", "Our dogs and cat do the same thing. They act like they haven't eaten in 20 years and they get whoever's there conned and they get fed again. Then we compare notes and say you got conned by the dogs or you got conned Cat again", "Every few months *at most*. I've gone longer periods without meat as well.\n\nI looked it up and there's not really any conclusive scientific evidence about this. Many people report experiencing it, but that doesn't mean it's universal.\n\nI suspect the amount of meat is also a factor. On the rare occasions when I eat meat, it's more like a sausage bun or a sauce with mincemeat in it, not an entire steak.", "My parents have veganistic friends. They turned vegan a few years ago, a great while after their daughters were born (they were like 8 and 6 or so?, now around 10 and 8 or rven more like 11 and 9).\n\nThey told us a story about how they use an app to check if there are vegan restaurants nearby (cool, cool) because they didn't want to go to normal restaurants, as their kids would see food they'd WANT to eat, but the parents wouldn't allow them that... I felt bad for the kids as it's obvious that being vegan is not what THEY want but simply what their parents wanted...", "Yeah, not a huge fan of forcing religion on kids either tbh.\n\nI grew up in a meat eating household. I naturally ate meat, because it\u2019s what my mom cooked for dinner. But if we went out, she didn\u2019t force me to order meat if I didn\u2019t want to. And when I decided at 10 years old that I wanted to be a vegetarian, both of my parents were fine with it.\n\n21 years later, I\u2019m still a vegetarian, my husband is not. He eats vegetarian the majority of the time though, because that\u2019s what I cook. Sometimes he\u2019ll make his own dinner if he\u2019s craving something, or he\u2019ll order meat when we go out to eat. I would assume nothing will change when we have kids. They\u2019ll probably eat vegetarian the majority of the time, but if they want some steak when my husband decides to make steak, well I don\u2019t give a shit.", "God, could you imagine if we all just let our 10 year olds eat whatever they choose.  \n\nCould imagine how healthy that diet would be\n\n\nCan\u2019t believe the stupidity of your comment or anyone that says let a child decides what they eat.   Candy bars and McDonald\u2019s everyday would be great for that kids health.", "They are saying why not let your child choose if he wants to be a vegetarian or vegan or eat meat.  I have a cousin who for a time was a vegetarian but she always gave her kids a choice in if they wanted a vegetarian meal or one with meat.", "One of our cats is like that. I can't really get annoyed about it because gravy and I have the same kind of relationship.", "Omg the child wanted meat or wanted to defy his controlling mother", "I hardly eat red meat. When I do I have to pace myself or I\u2019ll have digestive issues.
