It was a purple sparkly dress that had no sleeves and is VERY tight around the chest and thighs.. it showed the shape of my thighs and chest area and I just didn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s more than that too, it\u2019s very short and has no under garment. It\u2019s also extremely uncomfortable. While it is formal and a nice dress for some, I am very insecure about what this dress is revealing, but at the moment when I tried it on and saw I didn\u2019t like it I felt so bad because I knew my mom bought this for me and wanted me to wear it so I wanted to make her happy. I told my self I\u2019d wear it if I just deal with all the flaws\n\n2 days later, it\u2019s the day of the event. I wore my dress and oh my god, I just hated it, but my mind was filled about what my mom wanted. But after a lot of thinking I decided that I would wear another dress and hope that my mom would understand. So I wore this red dress which in short is way less revealing then the dress my mom bought me, it was formal and I felt comfy in it. \n\nI went to the event and my mom took a glimpse at me. I sort of stared at her back smiling to cover up that I wasn\u2019t wearing her dress. She gave me a stink eye and walked away. I followed after her wanting to talk to her but she kept walking profusely, almost running even. She gave me looks yet had no intention of talking to me. The whole event, we never spoke a word to each other, she kept giving me stares and that was it. \n\nAt the end of the event, I walked over to my purse and was ready to go home but my mom grabbed me by the arm and took me to a corner. She told me how ungrateful I was and I how I never cared about what my mom did for me. She just started talking about how bad of a daughter I was and I interrupted her telling her I was insecure when I wore that dress. The exact thing she said was \u201cI don\u2019t care, you never wanted to make me proud and you completely ruined my whole time at this party by wearing that dumb dress\u201d. \n\nI just can\u2019t stop thinking about it ever since then. Was it really my fault? I thought I was in the right but I keep questioning it. She wanted to see me in that dress because she took effort to buy that for me and used a lot of money.

You didn\u2019t have to wear a dress you didn\u2019t like and didn\u2019t feel comfortable in but you could have used your big-girl words and told your mum that when you first tried it on. You didn\u2019t tell her you didn\u2019t like it, so she was expecting you to wear it and was probably a bit hurt because not telling her gave the impression that you liked it. Her reaction was over the top and unnecessary and you are not TA but it could possibly have been avoided with a bit of communication.", "INFO: if you'd told her the dress didn't fit, would.she have told you to wear it anyway?

This is probably why she is upset. \n\nYou said in comment that you expected your mom to understand, but you didn't say anything to her. Your mom isn't a mind reader.  \n\nNext time she tries something like that, and you are not comfortable with what she wants to buy, or buys, for you to wear, tell her \"No. I am not comfortable wearing that\". You do not have to tell her the reason why you are uncomfortable.", "NTA. Your mother is controlling. She has a real problem if what you wore spoiled her good time at a party. \n\nIf you feel uncomfortable and self conscious at at party, you would be miserable all night. Would that make her feel better? It shouldn't.", "NTA. I have a 17 yo daughter and I don\u2019t always love her clothing choices, but consider it a style difference. If I think something is inappropriate for an event, I\u2019ll say so and encourage her to seek options. But I never would force her to wear something she feels uncomfortable in. I started out thinking you should have told her beforehand rather than surprising her, but based on her OTT reaction, I\u2019m guessing that wouldn\u2019t have been a great discussion either. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with that.", "NTA like others have said your mom sounds like a narcissist. Do some research about how to deal with narcissistic parents to protect yourself. It sounds like your mom is very emotionally manipulative since she is still not speaking to you.", "NTA.  It's a dress. I agree with the earlier comment that you're her daughter, not a fashion accessory.\n\nSorry your mom was so selfish.", "I thought that too, I didn\u2019t think I was in the wrong. But what my mom told me sort of hit me and made me think that she really loved this dress and wanted me to wear it. I understand now that I\u2019m not really in the wrong.

Ask her to wear if she likes it so much!", "OP never told her mom that the dress didn't fit. She had no way of knowing OP would have been uncomfortable wearing it. Some basic communication on OP's part would have avoided the whole thing.", "I\u2019m 17, but I buy most of my clothes. My mom doesn\u2019t particularly like my choice of clothing so I guess she bought this for me just for this event", "Well, I didn\u2019t know that she would act that way. I thought she would understand. But i know where your coming from and I probably should have done that!", "OP is 17", "17", "She has acted in a way that is unnecessary before, but it was never this bad because she completely ignored me which she rarely does", "I can totally see where your coming from. I figured that she would understand since she never acted this out of hand", "That\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard. The OP\u2019s mom wasn\u2019t ambushed. OP wore a different dress to a freaking party. A normal person wouldn\u2019t even care as long as it was appropriate for the event. OP - you are NTA and I have a feeling you are used to your mom being super controlling which is why you pretended to like the dress at first to avoid conflict. You definitely shouldn\u2019t have to wear a dress that makes you uncomfortable.", "Thank you! I\u2019ll try, I know she was disappointed and that\u2019s the reason I felt bad. I\u2019ll try to talk with her but at the moment she\u2019s keeping distance from me. Hopefully, it\u2019ll calm down in a couple of days and that\u2019s when I\u2019ll talk with her", "I hate armchair psychology so much but this sounds to me that she doesn't care about what you want and how you feel more than how everyone else sees the both of you, I think she just wanted to use you as a prop to lift herself up in front of family.", "Confronting her will never change her mind. She'll only double down. If you want a narcissist to forgive you just apologize and tell her how right she was. I've found it easier to deal with my mom when I just say sorry regardless of if I'm wrong. Just look at it like playing the player in order to smooth things over and make life better for both of you.", "Let her not talk to you.

I would never take it upon myself to pick a dress out for my daughter, and presume the style and fit were to her liking. \n\nI routinely purchase clothes for my daughter and her kids, who are in their teens. Most of the time, they have like what I\u2019ve picked out. Sometimes, however, they\u2019re not their style. I respect that, and would rather they were honest so I can return them, and not waste my money.", "OP didn't give her age, but sounds young. I was left with the impression her mom bought a dress that would show her off inappropriately.", "Oh, and I figured she\u2019d understand why I didn\u2019t want to wear that.", "NTA. I hope you learn to stand up to her when she tries to push her taste in clothes on you. There are plenty of things you could wear that may be a bit out of your comfort zone/dressier than usual for you that would still be appropriate without sacrificing your comfort.", "So, you should give her this dress back to return it to the store as it's still unworn. And never hesitate to say politely you are not comfortable or simply don't like something she is bringing just to save money and ecology.", "I also don't understand how a real short dress can be considered formal. Where I'm from, formal means full-length, as in down to the floor or almost, ending at the ankles. Short dresses are considered \"cocktail\" length, suitable for afternoon, early evening.", "Oh, thanks! :-)", "NTA but you should have told your mom it didn't fit when you tried it on.", "OP stated that she\u2019s 17", "I would tell her to return it but she hasn\u2019t been talking to me and I feel like it\u2019s going to make this whole thing worse. I will see in a couple of days if this thing calms down and ask her to return it.", "Well I can tell you that whenever a event happens in my family, many people wear short dresses, at least above knee length to parties. It\u2019s probably not so formal but it\u2019s the sort of dress you would wear to parties. And I guess that\u2019s what this event was", "I should\u2019ve, I just thought that she wouldn\u2019t react like this. I hoped that she would understand and she didn\u2019t.", "You don't need to ask her to return it. It's not as of you'd get the money anyway, so you don't need to make a request here. Just offer to give it back to her. \n\nWhat she does from there is up to her. She can return it, wear it, give it to someone else, put it in storage, or whatever else she chooses. You don't need to make that decision or worry about it. When she chose to buy a dress for you without bothering to find out if you would want it or fit into it, she accepted the risk that the money might be wasted. That's entirely on her, and not at all a problem you need to get into. In the future, if she tries this again you can decline to accept the garment in the first place.\n\nI'm sorry your mom was so self absorbed and mean. You didn't do anything wrong. But even if you had been out of line, the way she behaved and spoke to you was not okay. You are not her dress-up doll.", "Oh, ok! Thanks for explaining! :-)", "No problem! Thanks for your comment! I appreciate it", "You're welcome! Sorry, though!", "If the dress was uncomfortable and super tight, then it doesn't fit. Just tell her she got the wrong size, put the ball back in her court.\n\nOP, your mom sounds very critical of you. Be aware that this is a her problem, not a you problem. It's nice that she bought you a dress, but she should have had you try it on and been okay with your opinion of it ...and then taken it back. Or she could have taken you shopping to find something you both liked. Your mom is only thinking of herself, and the silent treatment is her way of trying to control you. I hope you go away to college next year and get some freedom from her. Good luck.", "At least, you could return the favor. For the next event, you should buy her a dress that's completely out of her style and color palette. If she refuses to wear it, tell her that she is \"ungrateful\" and \"never wants to make you proud\".

Maybe you could have warned her, but considering her behaviour, I don't blame you for not doing so.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Then get her to return it for a refund. \n\nESH as your mum should have consulted you and asked you to try it on before she bought it. You're 17 ffs.", "NTA.  Your mom should have taken you shopping with her and made sure she bought you a dress that fitted properly AND that you were comfortable in.", "Avoid these suggestions as the mother would have had time to browbeat/guilt op into wearing the bought dress and op would have been miserable.( From what op wrote the mother isn't someone understanding or willing to compromise = if that were the case your suggestion would have been spot on)", "NTA - you are a human being not a mannequin! If she likes the dress so much tell her she can wear it next time. You dress for you and nobody else - if you're not comfortable wearing the dress she got you then you don't have to wear it.", "NTA, OP, but I'd like to bring up the possibility that she bought the dress not realizing how it fit on you. Clothes can look very different on a hangar vs an actual human girl. I'm hoping this is the case and you all can talk it out. But remember, you will never be at fault for wanting control over your own body.", "If she loves it so much then SHE should wear it , not you. NTA\n\nShe is. Tell her to return the dress and never again buy something without input if she wants you to wear it. You are NOT a puppet nor a doll ffs. \n\nStand up for yourself op.", "You did good op.\n\n I think most probably she would have browbeaten/guilted that you into wearing the dress she bought and you would have been miserable.\n\n You did the right thing by not telling her in advance \n\nPlease don't doubt yourself.", "Whilst true, that still doesn't excuse her mum's childish reaction.", "This is the sweetest most innocent take I\u2019ve read in the comments. I super wish this would be the case for OP.", "NTA, and you definitely need to learn to stand up for yourself more.\n\n> She wanted to see me in that dress\n\nSo what? Her desires should have no bearing on what you put on your body. If some random person bought you lingerie, something tells me you wouldn't feel too inclined to model it for them - why is this any different?\n\nThe *only* thing that could've been done better on your part would be if you'd told her that the dress was uncomfortable and too revealing for your tastes - but even then, you don't owe her an explanation as to why you didn't wear the dress.", "NTA- If your mom loved the dress so much, why didn\u2019t SHE wear it?", "NTA. Exactly what part of this was for you? You're not a doll to dress-up nor a pet to show off. Folks treat dogs with more respect when it comes to outfits, OP; you wholeheartedly deserved to look and feel comfortable and formal, and not dress like purple, glittery sausage just because your mother mistakenly declared you should. You're not a bad daughter, you have a disrespectful mother not acknowledging her child has opinions and ownership of her own body. \n\n>She told me how ungrateful I was and I how I never cared about what my mom did for me. She just started talking about how bad of a daughter I was and I interrupted her telling her I was insecure when I wore that dress. The exact thing she said was \u201cI don\u2019t care, you never wanted to make me proud and you completely ruined my whole time at this party by wearing that dumb dress\u201d.", "Hon, I know you aren't ready to hear this yet, and it may be a while before you are, but what your mother did was not right. Whatever her goal was, it wasn't to provide you the most appropriate outfit for the event. In fact, given her behavior, I would guess that the purpose of your mother's dress was to humiliate you. You wore something else, which foiled her plan, and that's why she was angry. Not because you were \"ungrateful\", but because she didn't get to make fun of you, criticize how you look in the dress, or make a scene. \n\nYour mother's actions and words to you are not rational or kind. There is something wrong with her mentally. It's not something you can fix, there's nothing wrong with your behavior. I'm saying that she treated you badly, which you did nothing to deserve, and that's not how ANYONE, let alone a parent, should treat you. Don't feel guilty or bad. NTA, but you are going to need a lot of therapy to unpack the bad parenting your mom did, and it's going to take a lot of time to really understand it. I just hope you manage to get to a good place before you have kids of your own and start repeating her mistakes because you don't know better.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry but if she wanted something to control and to blindly listen to her, she should have gotten a dog.\n\nYou are a human being. Not a doll for her to dress up as she sees fit. \n\nShe's extremely selfish and I'm sorry she's making you second guess yourself.", "NTA. At 17 you have your own clear style and preferences in clothing.  Your mom should respect your maturity and taste by allowing you to choose your own clothing.  As long as the red dress satisfied the dress code, you were fine.  I had sort of the opposite problem with my mom as a teenager, she tried to force me to wear prints and styles suitable for little girls, or tent like clothes, or my brother\u2019s hand me downs.  She wouldn\u2019t allow me to dress as a young woman, it was tough on my self esteem and did a lot of damage to our relationship.", "NTA.  Tight across the chest and thighs?  Extremely uncomfortable? No undergarments possible?  When did your mom decide to start pimping you out?", "This goes beyond narcissism - this is straight up unhinged behavior. What kind of a nutjob lets *someone else's clothing choices* ruin their time at a party?", "So reading this? My first thought was that your mom bought you a dress in the wrong size/fit to make you look bad/embarrass you for some reason. \n\nWhat you describe was not appropriate for the event, so mom insisting on it makes me wonder *why*. And I can\u2019t think of anything good.", "People can say whatever they like, it doesn't make it true.", "Okay, but why is you not doing what mom wants the most disrespectful thing on the planet, but your mom completely ignoring your desires totally fine?\n\nBecause your mom is being mean and selfish. Even my toddler gets say in what they wear.  Why should you be any different?", "If your mom loved the dress so much, she should have worn it.\n\nNTA.", "You're not just 'not really in the wrong', you're 100%, absolutely, without hesitation, not in the wrong.", "It\u2019s just the mum\u2019s reaction renders it (very) unlikely", "Checks out moms choice", "Nta and I would counter that your mother cares more about how she felt than your comfort over an ill-fitting dress. You didn't throw a hissy fit or disrespect it's style or her. You didn't show up to the event improperly garbed in jeans or a bikini. You dressed respectfully for the occassion in a suitable dress that you felt good in  that's what she should be proud of. I'm a firm believer that a gift unwanted and unasked for is not a gift its a burden. Tell her you appreciate the effort buy you prefer to pick out your own clothes. she could taken you shopping or even have sent you a photo before she bought it for you to veto or accept (acceptance comditional on hoe it feels and fits on of course).Throwing the money spent on a \"gift\" for you in your face with a demand you should have worn something she picked is an a h move. The only time I ever tell someone to suck it up and wear an ugly outfit is if they are part of the wedding party \ud83d\ude06", "NTA. \n\nYour mother sounds controlling and superficial. She cares more about how everything looks than your feelings or comfort. Also, the other guests probably didn't even notice your dress or care about what you were wearing. You wore something appropriate, that should be enough.\n\nAlso, why is she buying clothes for you without your input, and decides what you wear? You are at least a teenager, maybe even older.", "NTA why would you wearing a dress ruin her whole night? She sounds very controlling", "NTA. Your mom sounds kind of toxic. Why should you be forced to wear something you didn\u2019t ask for in the first place?", "Your mother was so concerned about appearances that she invalidated your feelings, gave you the silent treatment, and then said \u201clook how you made ME feel omg you\u2019re a terrible daughter!\u201d\n\nSweetie, this is abuse. Straight up emotional abuse. My mother spoke to me like this for many years, and if I didn\u2019t do what she wanted she would also frequently give me the silent treatment until I cried and begged her to talk to me.\n\nNTA. But I recommend you start planning for an exit. This environment is not healthy for you at all.", "NTA. A tight, short sparkly dress does NOT sound formal, sweetie. It sounds like club wear. I think your mom tried, but it wasn\u2019t the right dress for you if you would be self-conscious and uncomfortable the whole time. I\u2019ll bet that your mom\u2019s feelings were hurt because she was excited that she picked it out for you. \n\nI don\u2019t think you were wrong, but I would apologize to her. Tell her you\u2019re sorry you didn\u2019t wear the dress, but you felt very uncomfortable in it. Tell her you thought it was too revealing and \u201ctoo old\u201d for you. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f You were not wrong; you two simply had different opinions. Maybe she can take it back.", "Don't armchair diagnose someone with a personality disorder. My best friend has NPD and is one of the most lovely people I know. Better terms for the mother are self-centered, manipulative, or asshole.", "Suits may be uncomfortable to wear, but they aren't *revealing*. OP wasn't uncomfortable because it was a formal dress, she was uncomfortable because it was a size too small *and* she felt it revealed too much of her body. A 17-year-old boy in a suit don't generally attract unwanted male attention, but a 17-year-old girl in a revealing dress? Yeah, no, there were *many* reasons for OP to feel uncomfortable with the dress her mom bought, none of which had anything to do with wearing formalwear in itself.\n\nNTA.", "> Why oh why didn't you show her that the dress didn't fit when you tried it on?\n\nAre you seriously that daft? Seeing how the mom reacted when she saw OP, you think it would have been a good idea to tell her beforehand?", "I'd send her a text or email asking if she really loved the dress she bought you why did she buy it a size too small.", "if your mom loved the dress so much, she can wear it. your body, your decision.", "You are a person, not her Barbie doll.", "She can buy herself a dress she likes. Money well spent. \nShe could buy you a dress you like. Also money well spent, if she wants to be kind. \n\nBut you are not her dress-up doll and you don\u2019t owe her the wearing of a specific thing, particularly if you dislike the look or feel of it. Telling you that you must wear this is an attempt to control you, and if you turning up in appropriate clothing of your own choosing ruins her day, that\u2019s on her.", "NTA, for not wearing the dress but I would have at least mentioned it to her. Idk if you're living with her but I can't imagine at least mentioning you might not wear it would have been hard. It might have lightened the impact as opposed to seeing you walk in day of.", "I didn't diagnose her mother.  I said her behavior was narcissistic. That doesn't mean she's a full-blown narcissist.", "yes it isnt a perfect analogy, I still made it in my head. And it was as close as can be for me since I personally prefer to wear less rather than more.", "My mother often took me shopping for clothes when I was that age. If it was for a particular event, we would find something that was both appropriate and that I also liked. She didn't just buy stuff that I didn't like and demanded that I wore it. Your mother sounds very controlling.", "Yes, an excellent idea! Then the mother would have realized it was a bad choice. The woman still doesn't realize that it didn't fit and that OP didn't like how revealing it was. Communication!", "Where were you when I was in a wedding and the bride picked strapless dresses?  \nI don't even wear short sleeve shirts.  I could have used someone like you back then!", "It's probably a pretty dress that looks great on the hangar. That doesn't mean it fits OP properly, or is a style that's flattering to OP, but her mom can't see that.", "It really does. My mom has bought me clothes before and has never once acted like this when I expressed not liking how it looked on me or not feeling comfortable in it. The mom's reaction is really telling."]}
