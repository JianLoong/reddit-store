It was a purple sparkly dress that had no sleeves and is VERY tight around the chest and thighs.. it showed the shape of my thighs and chest area and I just didn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s more than that too, it\u2019s very short and has no under garment. It\u2019s also extremely uncomfortable. While it is formal and a nice dress for some, I am very insecure about what this dress is revealing, but at the moment when I tried it on and saw I didn\u2019t like it I felt so bad because I knew my mom bought this for me and wanted me to wear it so I wanted to make her happy. I told my self I\u2019d wear it if I just deal with all the flaws\n\n2 days later, it\u2019s the day of the event. I wore my dress and oh my god, I just hated it, but my mind was filled about what my mom wanted. But after a lot of thinking I decided that I would wear another dress and hope that my mom would understand. So I wore this red dress which in short is way less revealing then the dress my mom bought me, it was formal and I felt comfy in it. \n\nI went to the event and my mom took a glimpse at me. I sort of stared at her back smiling to cover up that I wasn\u2019t wearing her dress. She gave me a stink eye and walked away. I followed after her wanting to talk to her but she kept walking profusely, almost running even. She gave me looks yet had no intention of talking to me. The whole event, we never spoke a word to each other, she kept giving me stares and that was it. \n\nAt the end of the event, I walked over to my purse and was ready to go home but my mom grabbed me by the arm and took me to a corner. She told me how ungrateful I was and I how I never cared about what my mom did for me. She just started talking about how bad of a daughter I was and I interrupted her telling her I was insecure when I wore that dress. The exact thing she said was \u201cI don\u2019t care, you never wanted to make me proud and you completely ruined my whole time at this party by wearing that dumb dress\u201d. \n\nI just can\u2019t stop thinking about it ever since then. Was it really my fault? I thought I was in the right but I keep questioning it. She wanted to see me in that dress because she took effort to buy that for me and used a lot of money. I just feel so bad and know I think I\u2019m an asshole.\n\nReddit, I need you to decide for me.

You're the one who had to be happy and comfy. Did she even ask you what you wanted? No. And I highly doubt anyone else complained. Stand your ground. Don't even apologize.

Sorry she didn't deal with it very well. Take time with her to explain, with acknowledgement of her gift, hopefully she'll meet you in the middle. NTA", "ESH. You didn\u2019t have to wear a dress you didn\u2019t like and didn\u2019t feel comfortable in but you could have used your big-girl words and told your mum that when you first tried it on. You didn\u2019t tell her you didn\u2019t like it, so she was expecting you to wear it and was probably a bit hurt because not telling her gave the impression that you liked it. Her reaction was over the top and unnecessary and you are not TA but it could possibly have been avoided with a bit of communication.", "INFO: if you'd told her the dress didn't fit, would.she have told you to wear it anyway? Just based on past experience.", "NTA - I\u2019m not sure where your mom is coming from here, does she think you don\u2019t dress up enough? I\u2019m which case she should\u2019ve gone shopping with you to find something suitable you wanted to wear. Not but you a dress that makes you uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nYour mom wanted to \"show you off\" by picking out the clothes for you and when ou wore something different you took that away from her.  This is probably why she is upset. \n\nYou said in comment that you expected your mom to understand, but you didn't say anything to her. Your mom isn't a mind reader.  \n\nNext time she tries something like that, and you are not comfortable with what she wants to buy, or buys, for you to wear, tell her \"No. I am not comfortable wearing that\". You do not have to tell her the reason why you are uncomfortable.", "NTA. Your mother is controlling. She has a real problem if what you wore spoiled her good time at a party. \n\nIf you feel uncomfortable and self conscious at at party, you would be miserable all night. Would that make her feel better? It shouldn't.", "NTA. I have a 17 yo daughter and I don\u2019t always love her clothing choices, but consider it a style difference. If I think something is inappropriate for an event, I\u2019ll say so and encourage her to seek options. But I never would force her to wear something she feels uncomfortable in. I started out thinking you should have told her beforehand rather than surprising her, but based on her OTT reaction, I\u2019m guessing that wouldn\u2019t have been a great discussion either. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with that.", "NTA like others have said your mom sounds like a narcissist. Do some research about how to deal with narcissistic parents to protect yourself. It sounds like your mom is very emotionally manipulative since she is still not speaking to you.", "NTA.  It's a dress. I agree with the earlier comment that you're her daughter, not a fashion accessory.\n\nSorry your mom was so selfish.", "I thought that too, I didn\u2019t think I was in the wrong. But what my mom told me sort of hit me and made me think that she really loved this dress and wanted me to wear it. I understand now that I\u2019m not really in the wrong. I just don\u2019t know how to confront her since she  doesn\u2019t wanna talk to me.", "Yeah I should\u2019ve. Just thought that she would understand if I just tell her why later on. But until the end of the event she kept ignoring me and that kinda was the consequence of not telling her beforehand", "NTA.  Not only liked  but felt comfortable in.  Ask her to wear if she likes it so much!", "OP never told her mom that the dress didn't fit. She had no way of knowing OP would have been uncomfortable wearing it. Some basic communication on OP's part would have avoided the whole thing.", "I\u2019m 17, but I buy most of my clothes. My mom doesn\u2019t particularly like my choice of clothing so I guess she bought this for me just for this event", "Well, I didn\u2019t know that she would act that way. I thought she would understand. But i know where your coming from and I probably should have done that!", "OP is 17", "17", "She has acted in a way that is unnecessary before, but it was never this bad because she completely ignored me which she rarely does", "I can totally see where your coming from. I figured that she would understand since she never acted this out of hand", "That\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard. The OP\u2019s mom wasn\u2019t ambushed. OP wore a different dress to a freaking party. A normal person wouldn\u2019t even care as long as it was appropriate for the event. OP - you are NTA and I have a feeling you are used to your mom being super controlling which is why you pretended to like the dress at first to avoid conflict. You definitely shouldn\u2019t have to wear a dress that makes you uncomfortable.", "Thank you! I\u2019ll try, I know she was disappointed and that\u2019s the reason I felt bad. I\u2019ll try to talk with her but at the moment she\u2019s keeping distance from me. Hopefully, it\u2019ll calm down in a couple of days and that\u2019s when I\u2019ll talk with her", "I hate armchair psychology so much but this sounds to me that she doesn't care about what you want and how you feel more than how everyone else sees the both of you, I think she just wanted to use you as a prop to lift herself up in front of family.", "Confronting her will never change her mind. She'll only double down. If you want a narcissist to forgive you just apologize and tell her how right she was. I've found it easier to deal with my mom when I just say sorry regardless of if I'm wrong. Just look at it like playing the player in order to smooth things over and make life better for both of you.", "Let her not talk to you. It\u2019s her turn to make up for giving an unwanted \u201cgift\u201d. \n\nAll u have to say is \u201cI do not wear clothes that make me uncomfortable. If you want to buy me something in the future get my approval of it first. \u201c \n\nIf she\u2019s not gonna feel bad for the emotional manipulation them ignore it. There is power in ignoring bullshit", "Hearing about your mother\u2019s reaction at the event, I understand your reluctance to address it earlier. She was out of line. I would never take it upon my to pick a dress out for my daughter, and presume the style and fit were to her liking. \n\nI routinely  purchase clothes for my daughter and her kids, who are in their teens. Most of the time, they like what I\u2019ve picked out. Sometimes, however, they\u2019re not their style. I respect that, and would rather they were honest so I can return them, and not waste my money.", "OP didn't give her age, but sounds young. I was left with the impression her mom bought a dress that would show her off inappropriately.", "Oh, and I figured she\u2019d understand why I didn\u2019t want to wear that.", "NTA. I hope you learn to stand up to her when she tries to push her taste in clothes on you. There are plenty of things you could wear that may be a bit out of your comfort zone/dressier than usual for you that would still be appropriate without sacrificing your comfort.", "So, you should give her this dress back to return it to the store as it's still unworn. And never hesitate to say politely you are not comfortable or simply don't like something she is bringing just to save money and ecology.", "I also don't understand how a real short dress can be considered formal. Where I'm from, formal means full-length, as in down to the floor or almost, ending at the ankles. Short dresses are considered \"cocktail\" length, suitable for afternoon, early evening.", "Oh, thanks! :-)", "NTA but you should have told your mom it didn't fit when you tried it on.", "OP stated that she\u2019s 17", "I would tell her to return it but she hasn\u2019t been talking to me and I feel like it\u2019s going to make this whole thing worse. I will see in a couple of days if this thing calms down and ask her to return it.", "Well I can tell you that whenever a event happens in my family, many people wear short dresses, at least above knee length to parties. It\u2019s probably not so formal but it\u2019s the sort of dress you would wear to parties. And I guess that\u2019s what this event was", "I should\u2019ve, I just thought that she wouldn\u2019t react like this. I hoped that she would understand and she didn\u2019t.", "You don't need to ask her to return it. It's not as of you'd get the money anyway, so you don't need to make a request here. Just offer to give it back to her. \n\nWhat she does from there is up to her. She can return it, wear it, give it to someone else, put it in storage, or whatever else she chooses. You don't need to make that decision or worry about it. When she chose to buy a dress for you without bothering to find out if you would want it or fit into it, she accepted the risk that the money might be wasted. That's entirely on her, and not at all a problem you need to get into. In the future, if she tries this again you can decline to accept the garment in the first place.\n\nI'm sorry your mom was so self absorbed and mean. You didn't do anything wrong. But even if you had been out of line, the way she behaved and spoke to you was not okay. You are not her dress-up doll.", "Oh, ok! Thanks for explaining! :-)", "No problem! Thanks for your comment! I appreciate it", "You're welcome! Sorry, though!"]}
