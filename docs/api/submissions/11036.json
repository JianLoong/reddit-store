Bilingual kids go through a period where they haven\u2019t learned the rules about when they should use each language.  That\u2019s just normal development, and the only time it causes problems is when other people make problems.  Eg, if the kids hear your MIL say that it\u2019s making them not bond, she may create a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Her comment would be the real cause though, not the bilingual speech - if the other kids were being taught to just remind her to speak English instead, that\u2019s what would happen.  Some of my cousins are bilingual, including one of the ones I\u2019m closest to - he spoke Tagalog from a very young age, and sometimes we\u2019d have to ask him what he was saying, but that was the full extent of the \u201cdifficulty\u201d in our bond.", "NTA I grew up trilingual and yes there were periods in which I wanted to speak only 1 language (so my parents say) anyway I grew out of that at age 5. Your MIL constantly berating her will create a complex, I saw this in so many of my friends who were told(ordered) to speak English.", "NTA because your daughter is *four*, and you said she didn't speak Greek the entire time. If this is real, your wife's family were being melodramatic. Some people really get their back up over relatives speaking phrases or words in another language, and I find it so silly. Whether it's jealousy, xenophobia or another reason, it's just ridiculous.\n\nAt 4 years old, your daughter is not only developing one language but two, so of course, she'll speak both for a while until she's old enough to understand when to speak English and when to speak Greek. Besides, in a relaxed family setting, she should be able to drop a bit of either language, regardless of whose company she's in. It's part of who she is, and it should be embraced. Your daughter's cousins can bond with her, regardless of language, and your daughter could teach them Greek - that's a great learning experience for kids.", "NTA. She\u2019s 4, she\u2019s going to need reminders that the family rule is being considerate and using the predominantly shared language but she also didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Kids are also super adaptable and easily make friends regardless of language, a reminder that they can\u2019t understand her speaking Greek and she\u2019ll have no issues bonding with cousins if they aren\u2019t picking up their grandparents attitude about it.", "NTA\n\nPlease don't let your MIL/FIL/any other person shame you for teaching another language to your child. Monolingual (usually English-speaking, in my observations) people tend to take \"offense\" far too often when this sort of thing occurs.\n\nYour daughter is 4 and she's going to use any and all the words she can - and this is a good thing. Please encourage this. Of course, gently help remind her that not everyone is going to know all the languages she does so , she needs to know when to use which language. Just please continue to teach her Greek and stay bilingual in your household!\n\nI will never understand folks who rally against this. I could have been bilingual, at least. My mother is trilingual but refused to teach me. It did not end well, suffice to say. I'm sorry your MIL and FIL don't appreciate how much your daughter is learning! I do. <3", "NTA and your in-laws feel insecure that you have more connection to your culture of origin and are taking it out on you and your child. \n\nFour year olds often don\u2019t even know which words belong to which languages. My cousin\u2019s mom is from Ecuador and he honestly had no idea which words were English or Spanish until he was about six. The result was not him \u201cnot bonding\u201d with his other cousins, the result was the rest of us learned some Spanish which we still recognize today. I can\u2019t speak Spanish but I know a lot of basic words because he used them all the time when we were kids and learning how to speak. I wonder if your in-laws are intimidated by the idea that your daughter might teach their other grandchildren Greek and they\u2019d be left out. \n\nThey could learn Greek if they wanted to be closer with their granddaughter, but clearly they don\u2019t care to. People think you can\u2019t learn languages when you\u2019re older but that\u2019s BS; I\u2019ve learned conversational Czech and Yiddish both since I turned 40.", "NTA, I am so tired of people acting like they are going to burst into flames if a language they don't understand so much as *whispers* past their ears. Your child is SO lucky to be raised bilingual, don't let your asshole ILs take that away from her.", "NTA when she gets older she\u2019ll stop switching between the two. Good on your family for being bilingual.", "I would respond with \u201cso what I\u2019m hearing is that you would rather we hinder your granddaughter\u2019s ability to boost problem-solving, critical-thinking, and listening skills, in addition to improving memory, concentration, and the ability to multitask. It has been shown that Children proficient in other languages also show signs of enhanced creativity and mental flexibility.  Not to mention that studies show that learning two or more languages actually help the braid structure grow, which will only help her into her adulthood, just so YOU don\u2019t have to hear an occasional word in Greek?\u201d\n\nYah, no!  I\u2019m going to continue on giving my daughter the strongest physical, physiological, emotional, and education foundation possible.", "Speaking a language around others that don't speak it can be considered rude since they think you might be trying to talk secretively. I get that, but your MIL and FIL being concerned over a child doing this is just ridiculous.\n\nI think you are T A because you used Greek in the way that your MIL and FIL were probably concerned about. Making a joke at someone's expense that they can't understand. Yeah, the joke was pretty harmless but they don't know that because they don't speak Greek! You should definitely apologize for that.

That seems like what they are more upset about at this point.\n\nInstead of telling them to stop speaking Greek, The MIL and FIL should try to be more inclusive. Whenever their grand-daughter says something they don't understand they can ask \"what did she say?\" and through this process they might learn a bit of Greek too.\n\nJust because the FIL and MIL are being shitty, that doesn't excuse OP's actions and she should apologize for being rude, not speaking Greek.", "Or \"I need that in Granny-speech, love\" to the little one.

They insisted to my parents that not speaking English would result in academic delays and even said it was the reason that one of my brothers ended up in special ed (he is dyslexic ; my other brother became an A student and star athlete). When my grandmother died, and we moved away from our predominately immigrant neighborhood to a rural community, our new neighbors were xenophobic to the point of more than once calling immigration authorities on my parents (they are both here legally).  Because of the shaming and hostility, my mother decided that my sister and I should be spared what my brothers went through and that she would always speak to my sister and me in English and insisted my brothers and even my father do the same as much as possible (his English has never been great).  As a consequence, it was much, much more difficult for us younger kids to learn Portuguese.  My sister does pretty well, and I know enough to get by (we both understand it proficiently because of my father and can read fairly well, but conversation skills are much harder than reading a language).
