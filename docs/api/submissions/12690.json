They make ur life miserable and if u do stand up for urself, they play the victim, saying that they don't understand where this is coming from. It's so incredibly manipulative. Entitled does not equal a h.", "I was honest. I said don't throw a party several times. she chose not to listen to me", "\ud83c\udfb6 \"I want a party with roomfuls of laughter\n\nTen thousand tons of ~~ice cream~~ peanut butter cake\n\nAnd if I don't get the things I am after\n\nI'm going to ~~scream~~ break\" \ud83c\udfb6", "Because she didn't want her Mum to throw her a party.\n\nThere didn't need to be any compromising on OP's part.\n\nGranted, being rude wasn't great, but 16 year olds will use language like that. It should be acknowledged and apologised for later, though.", "It is in the post that her mother refused to accept OPs changes to the party.", "Agree, refusing to celebrate with the mom and just not showing up was the AH move.  Not allowing your relatives the opportunity to celebrate this milestone bday with OP was an AH move.  Now, if the mom was unwilling to have a family party on a different date , that\u2019s not right either.  But dads party could also have been on a separate date.  I also get the cake thing\u2026.. If brother is super allergic to peanut butter having the cake in the house could cause a health risk.  Sucks for OP but I get it.", "A party her daughter didn't want. A party full of family that OP has no input about.\n\nA party where even the food isn't the foods OP likes.", "While I agree op was disrespectful,  mom was told not to throw a party and op has said in comments she told her mom she was not going.  Also, what part of the party was for birthday girl?  Not the cake, not the invitees, not the food.  I feel the party was for mom not her.", "It sounds like a family gathering and possibly a dinner? That\u2019s normal, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re asking for something extravagant that would warrant a spot on My Sweet Sixteen and writing about being upset because mummy got them the wrong luxury car. They literally just want a cake of their choice and to not be around a bunch of small children. They tried to communicate with the mom, mom put her own wants first. NTA", "Ewwwww that's not acceptable. Children are not responsible for the martial decisions of their parents. \n\nJust like children are not responsible for appeasing the ego of their parents on their birthday.\n\nA birthday party is supposed to be enjoyable for the person who's birthday it is. \n\nA parent has to learn to put their ego away and do what makes the child happy on the child's birthday. \n\nOp doesn't get to choose her guests. Op doesn't get the foods she likes. Op doesn't get the cake she likes (how hard would it have been to get a pb cake slice for op to enjoy that night after brother was able to be out of the area?). It kinda seems like this birthday party was for mom. Not for Op.", "How dare her sibling have a life threatening allergy. /s", "Exactly! OP might be acting like an AH, which doesn\u2019t mean she is an AH because she\u2019s got good reason to be upset. She wasn\u2019t unreasonable in her requests; so to have them completely disregarded is just F\u2019d up and shows that mom will most likely never see OP as an adult and be dismissive of any future decisions she makes.", "OP\u2019s parents have been splitting birthdays for years so mom has had opportunities to do better for her daughter despite what OP\u2019s dad has been doing.", "I can understand that but mom could also communicate and work with OP. A pizza party at home with a few of OP\u2019s best friends instead could have been discussed. I\u2019m sure OP would have at least appreciated an option other than the usual kiddie party mom would throw. There\u2019s still expense involved in doing mom\u2019s go-to party idea which could have gone into a small BFF gathering for OP.\n\nAnd if mom\u2019s family was so invested in celebrating OP\u2019s birthday, they could have thrown her a party as well. My parents were divorced when I was in high school and both made every effort to make my birthdays special even though they were vastly different celebrations. I knew what I could expect of each parent because they asked me and we discussed it.", "OP wanted a \u201cnot lame\u201d party for once from her mom. This has nothing to do with her parents taking turns. Sure, OP could have had two parties but this feels more like OP wanting to be heard by her mom. Mom got treated like shit because she needs a wake up call. OP will always lose with her mom; mom is going to do what she wants regardless of what OP wants. So even if OP had two parties, she would have had even more reason to resent her mom and her fake efforts to make OP happy on her birthday.", "I agree she is super rude, which is why I disagree with N t A, but mom disregarded ALL of OP's wishes for her bday (which were pretty valid), to the point she straight out asked mom not to throw a party, and mom ignored that as well.\n\nMom can't act like OP's feelings don't matter and then cry because her own feelings were hurt. OP communicated how she felt about the whole thing and insisted until she realized mom wouldn't budge and gave up. Mom set herself up for failure.", "Yeah, I just replied to someone that mom could buy a small cake in the flavor OP wants and then a few cupcakes for her brother or anyone else who may not like peanut butter despite not being allergic to nuts. There are ways to make this work within a budget. It just takes a little more effort than mom could be bothered to exert.", "I just take OP\u2019s attitude as being that of a teenager finding her place in this society that says 16 is a big deal. Maybe mom can\u2019t afford a fancy meal but at least give OP the cake she wants, even a small one and then cupcakes for her brother with the nut allergy. There are options but mom can\u2019t be bothered to work it out with OP.", "She was a NO SHOW, how so many of you think she's not an AH for the complete lack of respect is astonishing", "I get the OP sounds like a brat for the birthday cake and the food but seriously family member and little kids on a 16th f\\*cking birthday party. You're all delusional if you think anyone enjoys little kids at their 16th birthday party. Also having family members at every single birthday party sounds more like a excuse for the mom to get together with her family than a party for her child.", "Mmm, true. I was an unholy terror of a brat as a teen. But it took ten years out of puberty before I could see if.", "OP is allowed to express preferences, sure. Custody agreements are a real thing that dictate which parent gets the child for which events. It was OP\u2019s mothers year, she threw a party for OP. OP\u2019s father could have chosen a different day, but both OP and the father snuck around behind the mother\u2019s back to plan a second party for the same day.", "Darling, there\u2019s a thing called a custody agreement, most of which spell out which parent gets the child on which holidays and events. This was Mom\u2019s year. OP went behind his mom\u2019s back, conspired with his father (who is also TA here) for a party all without telling his mom, so that she planned a party BECAUSE OP snuck around behind her back. I read the post\u2026maybe you should have.", "Ahh, OP\u2019s friend have jumped onto Reddit, I see.", "Because your mother does something nice for you and it's all \"crappy\", \"cheap\" and \"lame\". Your attitude is rotten, dear.", "Honestly you deserve no party at all.", "Of course you don't - that would make sense.", "You sound like a 3 year old.", "TBH I think most of the people saying Y T A are probs crappy Mums themselves.", "I hope she remembers this treatment in the future if you should ever ask her for anything.", "telling her not to throw one isn\u2019t the same as telling her why you don\u2019t want her to", "Thank you for this! I heard it in Veruca's voice from the Gene Wilder film. It was glorious!", "Um, her brother is severely allergic to peanuts, can you blame her mom not wanting one of her children to die in a party for another child? It just sounds like income discrepancy between mom and dad and her mom is trying to do things based on her income. This kid has a lot to learn, she'll regret looking down on her mom so much once she loses her. OP doesn't appreciate what she has, just read the complete and utter disdain they have for their mother's efforts. Sure, the children could be a bummer but but she still gets a party, presents from a bunch of people, and food served from a restaurant or mom herself cooks. She sounds like a really involved mom. After reading so many posts of shitty parents on Reddit, this mom sounds awesome.", "Yeah that\u2019s probably why op gave up on stopping mom\u2019s party.", "She doesn't even get her favourite cake. And since it was the mom's turn last year, shouldn't it be the dad's turn this year?

What's sooo hard for you to understand?", "she knows why", "It would have taken nothing to get a slice of peanut butter cake, or a peanut butter cupcake to enjoy on OPs own time that evening. \n\nThe fact is, not one compromise was made by mom to ensure that OPs milestone birthday reflected the things she enjoyed.

Not her kid.", "Right, she can get a peanut cake at her dad\u2019s house", "I\u2019d have given up too\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f At least OP has one parent who supports her.", "SHE DOESN'T EVEN GET HER FAVORITE CAKE \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "Ya I get the sense you inherited your mindset from you dad, no decent parent would have gone without setting you straight for how your acting tbh.

It's her birthday though?", "-please don't do this I don't like it \n\n- I'm gonna do it anyway. It's your birthday?

I\u2019d be pretty pissed if my 16th bday party was full of my little cousins instead of my friends and didn\u2019t have any of the food i wanted. it sorta just seems like mom like throwing parties for herself", "Her brother can choose not to have cake. It's her special day, she should be allowed her favourite cake. Also, she doesn't want her little cousins running around. Fair point though? It seems like her mom just used these parties for a family gathering and wasn't this the Dad's turn to throw the party, though? \n\nAll those Y T As, yall are probably crappy moms.", "Sounds like her brother has a life-threatening peanut allergy though? Maybe she could have asked for her second favorite cake at her mom's, and had her absolute favorite with her dad? So many ways to be less of a spoiled brat.", "So many ways for her mom to be less selfish as well and actually do something that her daughter would be happy with. I've seen OP commenting that she has communicated why she doesn't like her mom's party to her, but she doesn't listen. \n\nHer mom can hold the party on some other day, and let the daughter spend her birthday with whoever SHE likes."]}
