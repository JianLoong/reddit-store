Idk why there\u2019s so many yta votes though. \n\nOP is having a milestone bday party and would probably like to spend it with friends/ppl they like, doing activities they enjoy, and with food they want. I see nothing wrong with that as that\u2019s how most ppl usually expect their bdays to go whether it\u2019s with a party/large gathering,  close friends, immediate family, a significant other, or by themselves. \n\nThe mom invited only her side of the family who has little kids they do NOT like. OP is not going to be enjoying their bday celebration with these ppl. \n\nThe peanut butter cake thing is understandable not to get for the whole party due to allergies BUT, like another commenter mentioned, the mom could\u2019ve gotten a separate cake to be eaten elsewhere whether it\u2019s a slice or a cupcake. The mom could\u2019ve also set up a completely different day that OP could enjoy that cake with friends elsewhere so that OP could maybe be more lenient to the idea of the \u201cparty\u201d the mom threw knowing that they\u2019re going to get the cake they like, just on a different day. \n\nIdk the financial situation of the mom, but just because the mom is getting \u201ccheap\u201d gifts and food or cooks herself doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the mom isn\u2019t too well off financially. We don\u2019t even know what\u2019s considered cheap and crappy to OP. If the mom is in a bad financial situation, the mom should\u2019ve gone \u201cthis is the budget I have and this is how many ppl are coming over. What food and beverages do you want for your bday that could feed everyone that you would also enjoy?\u201d That way OP could have a say on their special day. Who wants to eat food they don\u2019t care for on a day that should be about them? Honestly, I don\u2019t think the mom is in a bad financial situation considering OP said they wanted the mom to just not throw a party but the mom refused that and kept insisting causing OP to say \u201cfine, whatever\u201d. Personally, if I was struggling, I\u2019d be relieved that the person I was throwing a party for said not to. I would instead just take them out for dinner at maybe their favorite restaurant within budget. \n\nThe mom did not compromise at all for a day that should be about OP. OP decided to take matters into their own hands to get a day they wanted. Sure, maybe a bit of an A for not communicating to mom that they\u2019re going to dad\u2019s instead but I think the mom deserved it for not listening. If anything, the mom would\u2019ve refused to hear any of that and force OP to stay home.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s funny how ppl think OP is the A for not showing up to the bday party the mom threw.

The stepdaughter immediately left and the guest didn\u2019t even see her.

She did this to herself by not listening to you. But there is more to this situation.\nChildren are the most routinely oppressed group of humans. Based merely on age adults see fit to ignore the thoughts and feelings of kids, systems treat young people as property of their parents, and there is a prevailing idea that sees children as less-than human. \nThis is clear when examining common attitudes towards various oppressed groups, and the socially acceptable responses to them. Take, \"I do not like ___.\" Fill in the blank with some groups, women, black people, queer folks, children. How would you react to hearing that statement from someone's mouth? For most of us the first three would lower our opinion of the person saying it, but the last comes across as socially acceptable.\n\nLook at the systems that dominate our lives. Humans are forced into segragated spaces from a young age, divided into arbitrary groups by age, and forced to compete. This goes on for years, and the person experiencing this is repeatedly told that it is for their own good. This is called school, and it kills people. It killed friends of mine. The second highest cause of death among teens (people your age OP) is suicide. Mental health crises are rampant, regular murder is tolerated by authorities in a certain country, and the kids have no say in this matter. More examples include courts, with their handling of custody, abuse, and children fleeing. Hospitals regularly perform surgeries of infants with no medical need, MGM being the easiest example, but intersex infants cannot be forgotten. The State has a variety of arbitrary age cutoffs for \"rights\". You could likely think of more.\n\nThis post is a good example. There are many judgements that see you as being responsible for going along with your mother's plans, that your tone makes you sound \"entitled\" or \"like a brat\". Your feelings of frustration are ignored and belittled, your words read in the most uncharitable way possible. Other posters recognize that you are right, but still critique your tone, or say your mom doesn't ciew you \"as an adult\". This is correct, because under gerontocracy only adults are really human, it is wrong because the statement does not call that belief into question, but reinforces it.\n\nIf any of you reading this find it challenging, good. It should be. So many of us grow up internalising our oppression, then reflecting it back onto young people in our lives. It takes a long, hard process to realize that you are doing wrong, and a longer one still to fight it. I would recommend reading some of John Holt's work for a better grounding of just what is wrong with this status quo.

If she wants to have a \"family party\", she can do that for herself. Her doing that and then trying to say it's for you is kinda gross IMO.

My parents divorced when I was in high school and neither of them could do anything \u201cextra\u201d for my birthdays but we did talk about what I wanted and we worked out what was going to be a real expectation.

Why buy a gift or food for someone when it isn\u2019t what they want? This has been an ongoing issue but mom still keeps making OP feel ignored. This just came to a head because a 16th birthday should be different from those of OP\u2019s younger years.", "I always had a \u201cfamily\u201d bday and a friends bday.

Many states state that judges can take into consideration the desires of children 13 and older, but that does not mean they have to listen to the teenager, agree with the teenager, or even have a conversation with the teenager. It is very much up to judicial discretion in the majority of the US, and judges frequently do not have to explain why or why not they allowed a teenager to have or not have a say in the custody.\n\nBUT I do wonder with OP's three big complaints being that their mom throws a family party, they do not get the cake due to their brother being allergic, and the *cheapness of the event* how much money does their dad spend or have to spend on their birthday parties. That would determine the question of whether OP is TA for me. We do not know what Dad does better for birthday parties (other than the cake probably). Does Dad's family have more adults/teens close in age to OP compared to Mom's? Does Dad buy more expensive gifts? Does Dad make sure the party has Instagram moments? Or does Dad just have a more mature crowd around and buy things OP wants for birthday gifts? Does Dad have more money than Mom for birthday parties (or less children--I am assuming younger brother is a half-sibling? Does Dad not help Mom budget for OP's birthday so that OP prefers Dad's parties to Mom's?\n\nThere are a lot of questions we do not know. It could be that Dad listens better and that's why OP prefers Dad It could also be that Dad wants to be better than Mom.

I get it that friends are especially important at 16, but if the mom can't afford two parties and relatives also want to celebrate with OP, I can see why the mom went with the family party. Parties with friends tend to be more expensive. I wonder if the mom has explained all this to OP.\n\nI don't know why you assume that just because the mom invited family, refused to make a cake someone was allergic to, and couldn't afford pricy gifts or a separate party with friends, she hasn't done anything to earn respect the other 364 days of the year.

Be a little less selfish? Let the birthday girl feel special on her day, and spend it with her Dad? Solves a lot of problems innit? Also, I'm sure she's old enough to be allowed to choose where she wants to spend her birthday.", "But that\u2019s the thing, she\u2019s 16 and still working on how she\u2019s defining her encroaching adulthood. Mom still has her hand in how she wants the relationship with her daughter to evolve. If mom is still buying gifts that feel cheap and crappy to OP then mom can\u2019t just throw her hands up in defeat. Mom needs to do better. She just needs to ask her daughter what is important to her now, at 16. We all have toys we loved as kids but that doesn\u2019t mean you still love them at 16. It would feel condescending if you we\u2019re still gifted those things as an adult, as if you never matured. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into this but I think this is what OP is feeling.", "From what I read, mom has been doing this for years so I\u2019m going to believe that OP has told mom previously that this is not the way she wants to celebrate her birthdays anymore. It was up to mom to further discuss what she could do as an alternative to OP going to her dad\u2019s.", "That's a very good point. The AH behavior is the no show, not that OP wanted a different party.", "It's not even extended family. It's her mom's friends.

No one was harmed by having a birthday party. (Including the brother since the peanuts were kept at bay.)", "Yes, because risking your brother's life over a cake is not AH before.", "I totally agree with OP's words falling on deaf ears to her mother. However,  I still think no show is completely unacceptable. Truly, I think they are all AH's, we can debate all day who is in first place", "Again DAWG, if OP\u2019s mom couldn\u2019t afford what OP wanted, she should appreciate mom putting in as much effort as she could.", "Totally agree.", "Agree. I do think there's a financial asymmetry (seems that Mom is solely responsible for another child with a peanut allergy), and in general teenage girls and their moms tend to not get along for a stretch. So inferring that context I think this is probably a battle in a larger war that's been going on for a while and probably won't end for years.", "True, Mom could be handling this better. Sounds like Mom can't do anything right though -- the gifts are cheap, the food is cheap, the cooking is even worse. It's pretty clear to me from reading between the lines that this is part of the larger conflict that tends to occur between teenage girls and their moms, and these interactions are just the latest in a long line. OP is being unfair and providing a limited perspective in comparing Mom's parties to Dad's, hen Mom is obviously more financially limited (and it sounds like there is at least one other child at Mom's house); it's not her fault, being a child, but it doesn't mean she's right. Imo this is an ESH or more generously NAH.", "She was in ass in how she communicated that. Mom's stuff is \"crappy and cheap.\" The restaurant isn't good enough, her cooking is even worse. The dynamic seems pretty easy to figure out. Mom ended up financially worse off in the divorce. Dad can afford to spoil teen so he does. Nothing mom does is good enough. All OP had to do was have dad's party on a different day. This was her last party with mom as a minor. Once she's 18 she can celebrate however she wants.", "I\u2019m just commenting on peanut part of it. As a whole I think OP could\u2019ve handled this 100x better and I feel bad for the mom. The way she talked about the cake and how her brothers peanut allergy is a nuisance to her reflects the lack of compassion in the rest of the post and rubs me the wrong way, but it\u2019s also personal to me and I prob can\u2019t have an unbiased take", "I think everyone's the asshole in this situation. But the teen took a horrible approach to it. I think mom likely can't afford what teen wants and she's too spoiled to accept that so she just goes to dad who is in a better financial situation. We have evidence that mom's trying at least a little (she can't win whether it's her cooking or a restaurant, according to OP they're both awful). I don't think mom can win with OP.", "Yeah the tone of the post is yes a little bit bratty, but that's expected from a 16-year-old. The overall tone goes to show that mom doesn't actually seem to listen to what her daughter actually wants for her own birthday. The party is supposed to be for the birthday girl correct? So shouldn't the guest list and the activities and the food and everything be geared towards the birthday person's interests instead of everyone else's? I'll give the mom the point on the cake, no need to risk her brother's life over a birthday cake. However the rest of it should be geared towards the daughter's interest and what she wants, given that it is a party for her for her birthday, not for the mom to have a vanity show. If you don't listen to what your kids want, you don't get to expect them to be grateful for s*** that you did that deliberately Is the opposite. She told her mom no birthday party, her mom didn't listen. Mom doesn't get to throw a pity party because she didn't listen. You are not always right just because you are the parent. Parents can often times be wrong in situations, and sometimes you need to admit that.", "When a person is abused, eventually their 'tone' reflects DILLIGAF (Do I Look Like I Give A Fuck) about the mother's feeelings TO REFLECT the way the mother disregard's OP's feelings.\n\nIf you don't like it, you're likely an abuser in your own right who hates being hit BACK 'first'.", "Honestly I think that's the only point that the mother has in her favor. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37", "So OP just has to pretend to be happy about a party, to celebrate their birthday, that includes nothing they like?", "Except there was no effort, OP doesn\u2019t want it for their birthday, so the effort would be mom asking what OP wants.

Yes it's possible that OP's mom couldn't afford what OP wanted, but then she should have been able to take a step back and realize that OP won't be happy at the party and instead let OP have the party with dad. It seems like her mom didn't want to adjust for OP in any way. I'm not saying that she should have somehow found the money to do everything that OP wanted, but she should have just accepted that OP won't enjoy her party and let it go. Instead she threw a party that she already knew OP won't like because mom's own ego wouldn't let her give it up, and then you're saying that OP should have appreciated it? Why? I feel like a good parent would be able to realize that they should want what makes the kid happy, not what makes them feel good about themselves.", "Makes sense. But being the older one, the mom could definitely put her pride aside and let the daughter choose whoever she wants to spend the day with and throw the party on some other day.", "There is no reason why extended family is being invited against OP\u2019s wishes though. Mom could have invited friends instead. \n\nAnd most people will enjoy Chinese or Pizza for cheap, but yummy, food. Cheap gift can be avoided by giving OP the dollar amount instead - or possibly by mom being a better gift shopper. \n\nMy five year old gets more say on her party than this girl!", "Her mom could've done better too. Put aside her pride and let the daughter enjoy on her special day. Being financially limited and throwing parties that can't match up to Dad's level isn't her fault, but being stubborn about the fact that OP HAS to spend it with her despite knowing that she doesn't like it, makes her a huge AH. Being the older person, she should be more mature than that and a little less selfish.", "INFO: is your mom\u2019s financial position different from your dad\u2019s?
