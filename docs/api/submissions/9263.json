Your wife makes the point about waking up others on the complex\u2014that could present unknown problems.

They will probably just continue to do it when the weather warms up though? 1am barking would piss me off as a neighbour, but I assume that's sort of when the dog is left alone so maybe it can't be done earlier.

Without an undercoat is like a person wearing a long sleeve shirt in those temps. That becomes more true the smaller the dog is. There are morons who think \u201canimals are supposed to be outside\u201d and don\u2019t realize that we\u2019ve altered the dog\u2019s gene code in the extreme.

Her owner left her outside chained to his porch every night at below freezing temperatures, & she eventually had a litter of puppies who then got chained up out there with her. \n\nOne of his neighbors intervened, animal control came to take them all away, & I was contacted to foster them as I was on a list with the humane society. I\u2019m happy to say that the foster \u201cfailed\u201d & she\u2019s been with me for years now, but she still constantly seeks out external warmth & gets freaked out if she\u2019s outside for too long...
