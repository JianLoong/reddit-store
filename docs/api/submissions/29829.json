Also English is my second language. \n\nMy (70F) mother (88F) has passed away in September. She left behind me, my two kids Lucy (44F) and Nate (38M) and my niece Lara (43F) and step-niece Angie (50F). Unfortunately my brother, father to Lara and step father to Angie has passed in 2017. My dad deceased almost 30 years ago. \n\nMy dad was the head of the family, he took care of everything and my mom took his lead. She was a SAHM and its important to know that she was aleays looking at optics and what other people thought of her. Example she trew herself onto the floor when she learned that my brother took a Russian wife, who had a child (Angie was 4 at the time) and was divorced already.\n\nWhen my dad died my mom stopped going out of the house, didn\u2019t cook for herself and whenever something broke in her house she refused to deal with it. So I had to step up and altough I ended up raising my two kids by myself and was working full time I still had to take care of her, going to her house, cooking for her and generally getting everything fixed when broken. As she got older she got meaner to me, always criticizing what I cooked for her and demanded I shop individual items on a daily basis instead of shopping in bulk. I also got someone to look in on her every day to keep company and help heat the house and mow the lawn etc. and it was very difficult for me to leave her by herself so it meant that I couldnt take time to see my grandkids as much or have any vacations. \n\nShe kept saying how she will leave her share of the house to me when she dies because she appreciates my taking care of her all these years. Now, my niece Lara, altough a very nice and kind person was only visiting her every holiday but whenever she needed chopping wood or other things it was always me and my kids helping her out, it was only fair. So we had a lawyer set up a will and she signed it two years ago.\n\nSo last week I showed Lara and husband the will and they got very upset. She says she was blindsided and feels stripped of her inheritance. She got 7.5%of the house, same as Angie and I got 75%. \n\nThey are accusing me and my kids to cheating them out of her share and never want anything to do with us saying \u201cits the child\u2019s job to take care of their parents\u201d which I think reduces my efforts put in all these years.\n\nAlso Lara\u2019s family is well off, they own two\nlarge apartments and other property and basically set up for life. This inheritance is a small, worn down house(not US), which would not sell great unfortunately. There was some cash left (which my SIL called about 30mins after her passing-she wanted to know how much) but only enough for the funeral and wake.)\n\nI feel like this was fair if they only visit her 3times a year they cannot be upset that I, who was there for her for 30 years got a bigger share. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698481010, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17i96ce/aita_for_taking_a_bigger_share_of_my_mothers/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Leaving 2 of her grandchildren (Lara and Angie) 7.5% each. Is the main issue that the two kids being you and your deceased brother aren\u2019t getting an equal amount? Which would then go to his family? I\u2019m not a lawyer but it seems like the bulk of her estate would go to her surviving child, which is you unless stated otherwise to be divided between you and your deceased  brother(brothers family). Also you don\u2019t mention that your two children (Lucy and Nate) received anything monetary in her will. Is that because all of your family inheritance goes to you? The other 2 grandchildren each got 7.5%.\nDid you encourage your mother to cut your brother\u2019s share down since he was dead and oddly you mentioned that remark that your mother made that your brother took a Russian wife who had a child (Angie was 4 at the time) and his wife had already been divorced. Was that a big issue? Trying to get legitimate information here.\nI get that you\u2019ve been there helping all of these long years at the expense of your own free time and being available to her.", "There is nothing like an inheritance to create family animosity. NTA for adhering to the will.", "> oddly you mentioned that racist remark of him having a Russian child\n\nHe wrote that his mother clearly didn't approve of his brother's marriage so that could be the reason why she didn't leave to his brother's children much.", "Sorry, math is not my strong suit. In my country I should be entitled to half of the house as I\u2019m the surviving daugther of my parents (so 25%and 25%) My mother decided to leave her estate to me thats another 25% and thats how I got 75%. Since my brother passed His two kids (one bio and one adopted) got his 25%, which is 12,5% each not 7,5% (my bad). My kids are not in the will, the portion is left to me only.", "I actually just rephrased it but yes, I do believe that", "Yes not very nice but not included much in the story. I find that every story almost on here is so one sided. Nothing surprises me anymore.", "So are you a potato, a tomato or a pepper?

If that\u2019s the law of your country, thx for explaining that would have been helpful in the original post.", "I personally take every story as 100% true if OP don't give the reason to think otherwise. This sub is to help people understand how other people see their actions. The better OP describes the story, the more accurate impression of it people get, the better their judgement. If the judgement is correct, it will help OP to be a better person in the future (or realize they did nothing wrong). \n\nIf OP is hiding some important detail, lying or spinning an angle, they will get skewed judgement that will not help them in the slightest.\n\nI think it's if OPs goal is to get judgement on their actions, it's in their interest to present it with as less bias as possible. My interest here is to help people who are willing to get my honest opinion. If someone is not willing to get help and lies, it's their problem, not mine.", "J stands for Jaborosa, Solanaceae is a very diverse family.", "Yes. To all that. Well said, I agree.
