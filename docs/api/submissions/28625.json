It's one of my major passions, and sometimes I can get pretty immersed in it. Recently, I started dating this amazing girl, let's call her Sarah. We hit it off and everything seemed great.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, after the cs2 update (I've about 3000 hours on it) I was spending a lot more time gaming than usual. Now I'll admit it, I kind of stopped going out that often (we usually spent most weekends together) and in my defence, I was just excited for the update since I've literally played this game since I was 14.\r  \n\r  \nI guess Sarah reached her breaking point cause one day she decided to delete my account (I have the same password for all my accounts and she knows it). I fucking exploded. I had spent quite some money on it and had some pretty rare skins. Not to mention all the games I had bought. I'm honestly shocked I didn't throw hands. I told her to get out and that I never wanted to see her again.\r  \n\r  \nI think she waited for me to cool down cause a few hours later, she tried setting up a meeting through my mom. I decided to confronted her about it, and things got pretty heated. We argued back and forth, her saying that me gaming made her feel like she wasn't a priority and that she even tried talking to me about it. I had told her that I just wanted a few weekends off to play my childhood game but I guess she couldn't take it. The worst part of it all is that my mom took her side. I just left and took a long walk. I was so mad I didn't even know what to do.\r  \n\r  \nNow, I'm left wondering if I'm the one to blame for this situation. Did I push her to that point? Should I have been more attentive, or was her action an overreaction to my behavior?", "created_utc": 1696931165, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174h72a/aita_for_apparently_neglecting_my_girlfriend_and/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get the feeling you're pretty new to having to balance your life between real life relationships and your games.  You're gonna need to learn how to do that, and fast.", "NTA. I understand that you might have gone overboard with gaming but Sarah had no right to delete your account - especially when it includes financial losses. The right thing would have been to break up with you or threaten to break up because you are prioritizing something else than your relationship.

And she thinks it's ohkie to delete your accounts??? Gal knows no boundaries... \n\nI dont think this relationship is gonna work... and you should probably talk to your mom about how she is in the wrong here. I mean if you played this game since you were 14 then your mom knows what it means to you and how much time and money has gone into it. For her to sideline all that and support your girlfriends actions is simply unacceptable.", "NTA\n\nDid you neglect her and your relationship? Maybe.

It's okay to realize you don't match or that things don't work).\n\nWhat she did it's abuse. Plain abuse. And a huge violation of your privacy. Does she think she can act like this every time she feels neglected? What if you buy a car and work on it, will she cut the tires because she thinks the car is a priority to you?\n\nI would re-evaluate this relationship.", "ESH. She should have communicated her needs better. She should not have deleted your account. You should have not ignored  part of your life like spending time with your gf.

Make sure the next one is more mature and takes your hobby more seriously.", "NTA\n\nOkay - I can believe that you might be addicted to a game and might have been neglecting her.

Instead she decided to destroy something meaningful to you.", "Nta - all these ESH don\u2019t understand how relationships are suppose to work. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to spend time with anyone you don\u2019t want to spend time with, and you can spend your free time any way you wish. \n\nHowever, if you choose to not put the effort into a relationship, which you can do and it is \u201cfine\u201d as you can prioritize whatever you wish/what is most important to you/you need, then you must also be willing to accept that your partner may no longer feel valued, and because of that may cut ties. \n\nIt sounds like you two aren\u2019t communicating on the type of relationship you want or your needs. It should be acceptable to spend a couple weeks apart, but every relationship has different needs - it sounds like you two want/need different things from your relationship. Again, that\u2019s okay and now that you know that maybe you two  will come to realize you\u2019re not a great fit together.\n\nShe should of communicated her feelings and if she did, bc she stated she did, and you still ignored her, then she should of taken that as a sign that she is not your focus/priority and acted in her best interest/health which may have been to end your relationship. \n\nAt no point was it okay for her to destroy your property - idk why she thought that was a good idea or how she thought that was going to go?

She definitely didn\u2019t think that one through.", "Time to grow up.", "NTA. I can imagine you gaming all the time would be frustrating. She\u2019s your girlfriend and you being addicted to a hobby like this and basically neglecting her as your partner would be annoying. \n\nHowever that doesn\u2019t give her the right do something that\u2019s pretty much illegal. All she had to do was talk to you about it, or end the relationship, she definitely didn\u2019t need to delete your game. She just had to use her words but was apparently too immature to manage that. She also sounds kind of manipulative and controlling, maybe you\u2019ve dodged a bullet with her? \n\nYou\u2019re both immature but I\u2019m thinking that what she did was worse because it\u2019s sort of identity theft.

She destroyed your property out of spite. \n\nI suspect you Mom isn\u2019t all that nice to your Dad either. \n\nThis girl is a bad person.

But the actual Q is about how she went about dealing with her problem with you, and that was a huge breach of trust. \n\nShe didn\u2019t have the right to do what she did. What she should have done is talk with you. And if that didn\u2019t work she should have just ended it. She did have a very valid point about feeling neglected, but what she did was completely over the top and controlling, and a huge breach of trust. \n\nI would probably end the relationship, but I\u2019d also do a lot of introspection about how gaming can fit into a productive life, because what you\u2019re doing ain\u2019t it. The fact that you said you were shocked you didn\u2019t \u2018throw hands\u2019 is very disturbing to read and almost changed my judgment.", "ESH.

I would break up with anyone who felt justified in doing that to my property.", "NTA even if you were neglecting Her she is an adult and can talk you like an adult or break things off if it's not working. \n\n\nAs someone studying cybersecurity Jesus Christ do not reuse passwords if you can help it. We have password managers now if you have memory trouble and reusing that password means if any account is compromised they all are. Change all your passwords and store them In a password manager with the strongest password you can on it. It's like nobody minds getting credential stuffed.", "NTA.\n\nIf she thought you were gaming too much she should have made per position known and sat you down for a conversation and made clear your relationship was in jeopardy.\n\nGoing ahead and abusing the fact you trusted her with your account credentials to delete your account with no word is a massive breach of trust and a big red flag for me.\n\nIf you waited for her to leave for work one day and decided to throw her makeup or jewelry out over some beef would she think that was fair? Some would argue digital property isn't the same but that's a whole other argument.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA .... to infinity, knowing how much skins are in cs and how personal an account is, specially one with 3k hours i dont know how anyone can go with E S H?? The equvalent is my gf thought my car was more important than her, so she just burned it down. That invasion of privacy can not be justifiable in any way shape or form.

You need to get your shit together asap op.", "ESH, you shouldn't neglect your girlfriend in order to play games, you say you've played more than usual.

Try contacting customer service, and next time I'd suggest moderation).", "ESH.

You do not have to go out every weekend with your girlfriend you need to have time to play your games you need to have time to go out with your friends you need to have time to just sit there and chill.

You being surprised you didn't throw hands is such a dickish thing to say. Secondly you need to learn balance. My partner and I both like gaming and sometimes we get fixated on it but it's our own responsibility to make sure we make time for this we care. It's just a game dude, it's not going anywhere.

You don't have to spend every waking moment with your partner or texting them. But you should have a healthy compromise you both are happy with. 3/4 game nights a week and a weekend a month or something. Regardless whatever it is, this  should have been talked about. From what she is saying she clearly tries but you didn't hear her which is an asshole move on your part.\n\nThat said, what she did is absolutely the wrong response. She basically destroyed your property. (Games, effort and saves you can never get back)\nThere were so many other options she could've gone with, the simplest of all being using her words.\n\nI reckon your mum chose her side because she doesn't like videogames in general and it's rather easy then to call them a waste of time.\n\nCut your losses, leave this girl. In a next relationship though, pay a little more attention to your partner and talk about expectations and hobby time in advance.", "NTA it doesn't matter she destroyed your property even though it was only digital.

I just left and took a long walk. I was so mad I didn't even know what to do.\r  \n\r  \nNow, I'm left wondering if I'm the one to blame for this situation. Did I push her to that point?

There is no justification for that. Controlling how your partner spends time and destroying their things (even digital things) is crossing the line. \n\nYou should have experienced the logical consequences of your actions, maybe a fight or her ditching you for a boyfriend who wants to spend time with her. Run far away from this girl and be thankful you saw her true colours early.", "ESH Her for deleting your game.\n\nYou for computer gaming addiction. When your gaming negatively affects your outside life like school, job, relationships, finances etc\u2026 you have an addiction and you need help. \n\nYour girlfriend breaking up with you for choosing to game instead of seeing her for a month\u2026 is your sign that your gaming is negatively affecting your personal life and it\u2019s time to reconsider your attitude towards gaming.", "NTA. Also not ready for a girlfriend. Not to worry, Sarah is also too immature for a relationship. I'm genuinely sorry about your lost games; I used to play Myst, Riven and the other sequels, losing my games would have been soul crushing.\nJust pursue your own life, if you were actually interested in a woman, she'd hold more attraction for you, and you wouldn't need to be asked to pay attention to her.", "NTA\n\nShe should have just broken up with you.", "Have you emailed customer support? If you haven't made a new game yet, they could potebtially have your account on system to recover. I can imagine it being pet or child insurance. You could try and recover it.\n\nTry to calm down, and talk to her on her level. See it from her side first. People who do stuff like that need to be held by the hand in an argument which is led by pure emotion.\n\nExplain that you're sorry that she's felt neglected. And you didn't plan on the game taking up all of your time. But explain without shouting, that the game is like a childhood best friend, which you played growing up and it was a way to rest yourself. State that you have loved playing it again, but express that it won't be for long. It's just a game you can spend a lot of time on, like a good book for binging a tv show.\n\nThen, explain after she's had time to relate to those emotions. Explain that what she did is extremely wrong. It's like beating up a friend because they've popped into town for a little bit and you have went to catch up with them before they leave again. It's crazy, and you're concerned with how she handled it emotionally. Don't make her feel alienated with this, ask her if she's alright. Let her express herself if she has anything bottled up. Maybe before CS2 came out you weren't paying her much attention so she already felt like you were distanced, then you going cold turkey on her made her worry about the relationship.

Where your experience seems to have more balance where both parties try at least and compromise. Where I feel with OP there wasn't much compromising. It can also just be a perspective thing and we think differently. I should note also I should have said esh instead of yta as that is what I meant. Also I am glad that things worked out for you.", "Lol okay dude, let's just say we can agree to disagree. Because I don't want to do a back and forth all day.", "Yeah honestly I see it as more value, it's like if someone spent a lot of time on a craft or something as well as spending money on materials just for someone to smash it. Things that just cost money can be replaced, time can't.", "Yeah that's what I'm saying.", "He admitted to playing over 9 hours and balking on plans.", "If she didn\u2019t talk back so much he wouldn\u2019t have hit her ESH.  - you", "So you think the vast majority of responses on this subreddit should be ESH if the OP did something even a tiny little bit suspect and their partner wildly overreacted.\n\nWife spends too much time talking with her mother on the phone for a couple of weeks; her husband deletes all of her social media and destroys her phone. That's ESH to you.", "Which means he acknowledges his ability to impulsively act on violent emotion. If his thoughts became action? What then? He should be in control of his thoughts.", "Yeah, I don't go to victims and tell them to learn from their abuse. Sure that might seem productive to a twisted individual like yourself. I understand your point, it's just a bad point.", "... Do you own anything like a prized possession, possessions or activity? Well maybe you can imagine. Then go a step farther and have your trusted partner destroy that thing you've invested a good chunk of your life and money on. If you have a little empathy, sympathy or even imagination, you may be able to validate ops feelings", "Saying he is suprised he didnt throw hands is also a sign of toxic/abusive behaviour. Why is everuone so quick to overlook this part of what OP said. Doesnt matter if hes \"young\". Hes 18, time to start acting like an adult... for both of them.", ">How many hours in a row were you gaming for?\n\nHe answered this in his original post.\n\n>If she tried to communicate and spend any time with you did you blow her off?\n\nHe admits that he did this so answered it.\n\n>Ignore her?\n\nArguably from the above he did this.\n\n>Yell at her?\n\nCompletely made up by you.\n\n>Did you blame her if she dared try to distract you?\n\nCompletely made up by you.\n\nAnd then you take it all as though it actually happened, including the stuff you made up.  That's weird.", "As your inability to read strikes again, I\u2019ll highlight where I said \u201cthe vast majority of cases\u201d. This does not mean all cases. The example you gave is where an OP would be an AH.", "If a wife was spending 9 hours a day talking on the phone (like OP was with gaming) then yeah, I\u2019d still probably go with ESH.", "Yeah right, so that makes him E S H because while he thought, in his own brain, and only internally, that he was surprised he didn't throw hands. While his GF decided to do actual harm to his digital property, you know, something of tangible financial and emotional damage. Amazing how disgusting people can be in justifying this sort of behavior.\n\nNTA, period.", "Lol, so you're complaining about someone receiving abuse on one hand while giving a complete stranger on the internet abuse on the other by calling me a twisted individual. Attacking people because you don't agree with them, not very emotionally mature is it?", "Im not denying he probably feels betrayed, hurt, and dismayed. However that does not excuse thoughts of physically violating another. They are just thought but saying he is suprised means this may be a reaction that has occured before.", "Those were all questions directed at OP but I see how they come off as accusatory. Per OPs comment he played for 9 hours and said he had \u201cplans\u201d to not have to do anything with her, that\u2019s shitty behavior. Her behavior was unhinged, but I\u2019m not going to call OP blameless (nta) here. They very much mutually sucked, even if she sucked proportionally more. Since she didn\u2019t write the post I directed my comments at him. If this had been \u201cAITA? I deleted my boyfriends gaming profile because he was ignoring me\u201d I would\u2019ve called her the unhinged asshole and directed my questions at her. It\u2019s not that deep or sexist or whatever you want to make it out to be.", "You think I'm justifying her behaviour? No. Thats you picking your side of the fence.\n_______\nI'm saying ESH, because both are at fault. Just because one action is worse than the other doesnt mean neither is in poor haste. Both are responsible to differing degrees. You just want to pick the side that looks the most appealing when there isnt one.", "It's almost like people have opinions that are different? What a novelty concept. You can stop trying to force your opinion on me. I've seen 0 reason to think that E S H is a reasonable judgment. Frankly, there's an amazing amount of bias for 2 things that are very different in severity, especially when one was started by the other."]}
