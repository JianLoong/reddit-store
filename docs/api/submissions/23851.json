I told her I was glad because I really didn't think it was a nice name and I liked something a lot more fresher and youthful. She asked if my husband felt the same way and I said yes.

The reason I might be an asshole is clearly my sister is in some kind of weird place right now and is behaving childishly. But by telling her this, saying she was childish, I did not deescalate things and I know people are less likely to see themselves as wrong when spoken to the way I spoke to her.
