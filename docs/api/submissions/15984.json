I have been very lucky to do a lot of travelling and my favorite places to visit here, are the seaside cities and towns.

I also don\u2019t eat seafood. My husband loves it. When we go to seaside towns I totally understand that he wants seafood. Not every meal, but for some of the meals. And most restaurants that serve seafood have another options. But even if a place he wanted to try that was on his bucket list didn\u2019t have another option, he would come with me to grab something to eat at another restaurant first and he would just grab a drink.

If your friend group consistently accommodates her, your friend could suck it up occasionally and accommodate everything else.  There must be something on the menu she could eat even if she doesn\u2019t want seafood.  Bread?  Noodles?

Part of being in a group is accommodating others, your friend doesn\u2019t seem to understand that. \n\nI don\u2019t eat seafood, I go to seafood restaurants. My preferences doesn\u2019t mean my spouse/family shouldn\u2019t eat what they like. All I need is to find one thing to eat, could even be a side or appetizer. If I\u2019m hungry after, I can grab something. \n\nYour friend is lucky you guys have been so accommodating, but this is not just their experience and should be flexible to others needs/wants.\n\nThe sulking is terrible and will end up getting them excluded from things if that\u2019s how they act when they don\u2019t get their way.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You announced it well beforehand, she could have made alternate plans for herself, but since there is none-seafood available, I don't see the big deal. She isn't allergic to it, right? And even then, she could just have done something on her own and met up with you guys for a drink after... having compromised for her three times is plenty.", "NTA.

If you're going to a \"seaside town\" there's going to be seafood on the menus of its best restaurants. Maybe only seafood. I'm extremely allergic to fish, and have been since I was a child. Anaphylaxis allergic. \n\nI can eat shellfish, and I have had no problems eating shellfish in good restaurants as they have protocols that prevent cross-contamination. I also encourage my husband to order fish when we go out because he can't cook it at home (the odors trigger my allergy). \n\nThat being said, if I can sit with people in a seafood restaurant while they eat fish, then \"not liking fish\" is not a valid reason to inconvenience my friends.", "NTA ! Compromising goes both ways!\n\nAlso, which seaside city & restaurant are you referring?? Might go check out if really good! ^^", "Thanks everyone for your comments ~", "NTA. Goodness. It would be another issue entirely if she had an allergy or doesn\u2019t eat shellfish due to eating kosher, but she\u2019s just actively trying to ruin a seafood dinner for the rest of the group because it\u2019s not what *she wants*. \n\nI am **highly curious** to know what kind of food she *does* want to eat. In the US, i\u2019ve heard them referred to  as the \u201cchicken nugget crowd\u201d because all they\u2019ll eat at any restaurant is breaded chicken strips.", "NTA -  You\u2019re in Korea, seafood is in everything from the kimchi to the soup broth.  It\u2019s unreasonable assumption that the peer group will avoid seafood at all times.  The only way I would change my vote was she\u2019s allergic to seafood.

It sounds as the group have been extremely accommodating, to the extent of it placing a limitation on fully experiencing the culture, but when you asked for some flexibility she was incredibly ungracious and spoiled the trip.

I had no problem with it because it was one meal out of many meals we had there. \n\nTo ensure that I wasnt salivating at the food, I ate before we went for dinner because we were heading to check out myeongdong street after dinner. \n\nPart and parcel of travelling in a group is compromise. \n\nDont ever travel with her again.", "NTA\n\nI would exclude her now and then if she's consistently that difficult.... \n\nYou're TA if you constantly impose your restrictions on others.", "The restaurant is \uc2f1\uc2f1\uac8c\uc7a5\ub9c8\uc744 in Yeosu, Jeollanam-do.

Why are you always eating down to the person with the most restrictions? If it was an allergy, I get it but it's not. Why did you even take her on the trip if it's five hours and you all specifically wanted to eat the seafood there? Poor planning and she's an asshole. I don't know why you lessened time in another country because other people behave in a whiny manner. I hope you got the seafood.", "NTA I lived in Korea. I went to Busan to the fish market and sat happily while my friends enjoyed the food. She\u2019s a brat.", "If it were an allergy or the smell made her nauseous, I could sort of understand. But then you solve that by letting the other 4 people go and you go somewhere else. If it\u2019s an I don\u2019t like it (which is me), maybe there\u2019s sides you can order and make that a meal. Or eat before. Heck, have dessert. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You and your other friends have been waaaay more accommodating than I would have been! Friends need to compromise for each other, but it seems like she feels she\u2019s exempt from that. \n\nAnd having lived in Korea, too, I know your friend could eat perfectly well at most restaurants by just eating the banchan!", "NTA. I\u2019m a picky eater and encourage my friends to eat what they want, where they want. I appreciate it when they compromise for me but completely understand when they don\u2019t.

And go have a good time at the places you all have wanted to visit.
