Also, my sister is a picky eater, so she will eat before or after us if we go out to a place that doesn't have food she likes (this was twice, although one was an accident).

Take her to a seafood place for her birthday every year and just pick something else to eat for myself.  It isn't that hard to be considerate of other people.  What is it with these entitled people who think that if they don't like/can't have something then no one else can have it either?", "NTA. Part of the reciprocity of a friendship would be that she acknowledge she limits the dining options so she should bow out sometimes so y\u2019all can try other things", "Nta, she sounds very entitled and used to getting her way, I assume.", "Are you going to let us know how this turns out?", "So this is a slightly different situation, but let me take a sec to explain how my friend group handles these things when we get together to have dinners.\n\nOur \u201cmain group\u201d is nine people, 7 of whom have pretty severe dietary restrictions. K is allergic to 16 foods including all peanuts and tree nuts, soy, peas, beans, and carrots. R and E are vegan. L is vegetarian and has celiac disease. C is in ED recovery and has some restrictions as a result. P and M are extremely picky due to neurodivergence. If we invite more than our core group, we\u2019ve also had friends who are halal, kosher, or suffer from other allergies. I like to joke that my friends are preparing me for any food restriction my future kids may have. \n\nNow we cook for everyone, which can be hard. There aren\u2019t many vegan dairy substitutes that don\u2019t contain nuts or soy, for example, and gluten-free flour may contain nuts as well. And as you said, the vegetarian and vegan friends may not want to eat around meat dishes. And the picky friends each eat only a few safe foods.\n\nDespite this, we\u2019ve had great success. We try to make as many sides vegan as possible, and label everything that could contain an allergen or trigger food. In setting the table, we place meat dishes on the opposite end from herbivores. We modify family recipes to use oat milk or rice flour.\n\nThe picky friends are actually some of the easiest to accommodate. We\u2019ll make them each a chicken breast with simple seasonings, or buy raw vegetables and dipping sauces, or make sure there\u2019s enough rolls if they\u2019re feeling like they can only handle bread that day. \n\nBut the trick is that everyone accommodates each other. As long as there is physically something everyone can eat, we all understand not to judge each others choices or make comments about what we\u2019re eating. In all honesty, the dinners have brought us way closer together.\n\nMy point is, I understand the difficulties of trying to please everyone in a group that has wide and varied dietary needs. But if your friend does not have a legitimate reason not to go to this restaurant, besides simply not wanting to be around the food, I feel like that\u2019s unfair to you. Friendships only work if you do your best to meet everybody\u2019s needs, not just one person. If she can\u2019t put one thing aside to make all the rest of you happy, maybe she\u2019s not being a good friend right now.\n\nNTA. I wish you well and I hope your time in Korea is amazing!!", "NTA\u2026recently went on a girls crafty weekend to an area off a bay.  Known for seafood.  One gal does not eat seafood.  She did not complain when others ate seafood, but we made sure that the restaurants had other options as well.  If there were other items in the menu, then you are correct, your friend could suck it up gif I\u2019ve meal, especially when everyone else been so accommodating to her all the time.", "Unless just being around seafood will make her ill, NTA.\n\nLike your friend, I have a lot of problems eating seafood - and I have found that most seafood places also serve other things which are perfectly safe for me to eat. My SIL LOVES seafood, and taking her to a seafood restaurant when she visited was one of my favourite things. So what if I had to eat just chips (which happened on one occasion)? She enjoyed it so much!", "NTA, and I say this next part as someone with a LOT of food allergies: I would think long and hard about staying friends with someone who thinks they should dictate every meal.", "NTA.\n\n\n\nJust wanted to say that the rest of the friend group & you sound like some super sweet ppl for being so thoughtful every time y'all hang out w that one friend. \n\n\nShe gotta realise that just because she is a picky eater herself, it doesn't mean that others have to be deprived of what they really want/enjoy to eat every single time just coz she said so \ud83e\udd74\n\nHope you guys ended up going to the seafood restaurant and enjoyed the food! \ud83d\udc95", "Exactly!

There are no allergies here to seafood, and none of the other friends in our group have allergies either. \nAs I said before, we have picky eaters as a whole, not just her. The two other guys are picky with different things, i.e spice and meat. So we have to account for different preferences, which everyone is allowed to have.\nAs for why we don\u2019t visit somewhere else, we don\u2019t just visit for the food, we absolutely love the towns and cities we get to travel to and are very lucky to have the ability to do so.\nWe have travelled to many places and this is one of our favourites!", "on group vacations, our family got so tired of endless discussions and compromises of activities and restaurant choices.  We have \"own happiness\" nights - everyone is responsible for their own happiness.  So if some get seafood, others get Italian, fine.  If some people go see one movie, other people go see another around the same time if they like.  Everyone is responsible for their own happiness.  It works.", "NTA\n\nI hope you savored every delicious morsel.\n\nShe seems insufferable and frankly I would not want her in any group in which restaurant eating was part of the plans. I would meet her for a movie and then get a hamburger or other simple food and then have a group of foodie friends you dine with at exciting restaurants. What is the need for people not have different friends for different interests and activities?\n\nAs an adult, if for any reason, I couldn't participate in ANY activity that most of the group wanted, I would be an adult and find another way to entertain myself. That is basic to being an adult - I could go to the movies; sit at a cafe and people watch; go shopping; go to museums or just take a nap. \n\nIn this scenario it was a restaurant but there are other times when no every one wants to participate in the same thing. Maybe I don't want to take a hike up a mountain or maybe I am not a great swimmer so I don't want to go scuba diving or I am bored by fishing and hate being in a boat. Or I don't like shopping or the opera.", "NTA I have a medical condition that prevents me from eating red meat. However, when I go out, I can always find something on the menu that I can eat.

And really, you shouldn\u2019t be avoiding ordering seafood yourselves around her. She can eat what she wants, you can eat what you want. Her expecting the people around her to not eat something she doesn\u2019t like makes no sense and is super entitled.
