It makes me sick that a non blood relative is getting that money.\"\n\nQuite frankly, I believe your SIL was probably onto something.\n\nYou're clearly an entitled asshole. I hope any legal attempts to get more from her estate are fruitless.\n\nAlso, ex-SIL is EXTREMELY misleading. She's your brother's widow, she didn't divorce him. You're a heartless asshole too.\n\nOn a related note, your comment about your grandmother not approving of your lifestyle was also unnecessary (and very misleading). In a response, you explained that it was because she didn't like how you spent your time or approve of people you spent time with. In other words, the typical disapproval just about everyone experiences with their parents/grandparents growing up.", "You went no contact. You had every right to do so, just as your grandmother had the right to leave you out of it completely, which she didn't.\n what about your lifestyle did she not like?\n\nUpdate: YTA", "Psst, Your brothers kids are your grandmother's blood and their Mom is the caretaker. If you wanted to be a gold digger of your grandparents fortune maybe you shouldn't have disappeared while your SIL stuck it out. That money would be wasted on you and it sounds like the rest of your family agrees. Climb back into your hole and leave them alone. YTA.\n\nEdit: oh you are a junkie with a mountain of debt and had already burned your bridges with your grandmother and the rest of your family. She made the right choice. You aren't getting that money.", "You already said you aren't backing down from this conflict, so not sure why you're asking. But since, you asked, absolutely YTA. Your grandmother had every right to leave her money to whomever she wanted. Since you were NC for a decade, it's mind boggling that you assumed it would be you. Just move on with your life.", "YTA. \n\nIt was your grandmother\u2019s money, and you chose not to have a relationship with her because she used it to control everyone. Do you really not see the irony here, OP?", "YTA for sure.  That rift between you and your grandmother is why she gave the money elsewhere.  If the money was that important to you, you needed to fix that rift while she was still alive.  That\u2019s what happens with inheritances - the deceased often left their money to the people they approved of and had active relationships with.\n\nHarassing and yelling at your former SIL is a sick move.  You\u2019re blaming and punishing her for something your grandmother chose to do.\n\nAlso, she\u2019s not your ex SIL - ex means the relationship split, your brother\u2019s widow is your former SIL.  It\u2019s astonishing to me that you can behave like your losing your brother is so much worse than her losing her spouse and the father of her children.\n\nYou don\u2019t have a half.  She has taken nothing of yours.  You gave that up when you didn\u2019t do anything to mend the rift with your grandmother.\n\nAs for feeling sick\u2026I\u2019m feeling sick that you don\u2019t consider your brother\u2019s children to be blood relations to your grandma.  You know that\u2019s a big part of why your former SIL inherited, right?  Your grandma wanted to make sure your brother\u2019s fatherless children are taken care of.\n\nYou probably have no options, btw.  Your grandmother made it clear that giving you a small inheritance was intentional and not an oversight.", "I feel like considering you mum also said to leave the SIL alone there is an incredible amount to this story left out and the reasons for being left so little is far more substantial than not approving of lifestyle", "YTA oh look another person who thinks their entitled to something that's not theirs.", "Ahhh, greed.  \n\nThe $ was left to your SIL.  And your grandma made sure it would be next to impossible to contest the will by acknowledging you in it and leaving you a small amount.   YTA.", "Uh. Did your SIL divorce your brother, or your brother left behind a widow. Otherwise she\u2019s not ex-SIL. YTA.", "YTA. You conveniently forgot about your brother\u2019s kids when you were yelling about the money going to a non blood relative. \n\nYou made the choice to go NC with your grandmother, which was your right. Now you are dealing with the consequences of your choice. Welcome to being an adult.", "YTA there isn't a \"my half\". That money has absolutely nothing to do with you. That money is for your brother's wife and kids holy shit. If this is how you act I'm not surprised you only got $1000. She probably only gave you that so you couldn't say you'd been forgotten about and contest it (hence her saying her lawyer knows the reason why, they probably advised her to do so when she said she didn't want to give you anything)", "YTA it\u2019s never been your money.  It never will be yours.  It will help take care of your SIL and her kids (your nieces/nephews?).   Take responsibility for your life and take care of yourself.", "Massive YTA", "Yeah, YTA\n\nIt's none of your business. Your grandparents seem rude in the \"disapproving your lifestyle\", but it was their will and money\n\nExtra AH for \"demanding\" what literally wasn't left to you.", "Holy shit YTA. Your grandmother can leave her money to whoever she wants. You're not entitled to ANY of it.  You didn't even have a relationship with her, you're lucky she left you anything.", "YTA so people like this do exist outside of plot devices for dramas.", "YTA. That money was never yours and you aren\u2019t entitled to it. Your grandmother left you a nominal amount so that you can\u2019t contest. Apologize and move on so that you don\u2019t lose the rest of your family.", "Was never your money to begin with it was your gramma\u2019s. You have no right to over ride her decision. YTA", "YTA. What she got is none of your damn business. Just because you are a \"blood relative\" does not entitled you to jack shit. Be grateful for the $1000 you got. There is no \"your half\". Wow. If you continue to bother her you're looking at causing yourself a lot of *other* legal problems. Good luck with that.\n\nA distant relative of mine gave all his money to charity and a portion was given to a specific friend of his to care for his dog- completely snubbed his 4 children. They tried to contest it, but they lost and it cost them their own money.", "YTA.\n\nYou are going to be torn to shreds on here for your entitlement", "YTA. It is none of your business how much money your grandmother left to SIL. It was your grandmother's money, it was hers to give as she wished. And it isn't your SIL's concern that you need the money - that is yours. Sounds like you will need to change your life the hard way.\n\nListen to your mother and walk away from this.\n\nEDIT: you ask if I could walk away from money like this. I did. I was estranged from my father for 15 years before he died and, like you grandmother, he only left me $1000 in his will. However, unlike you, I did not contest it in any way. I accepted it. In fact, I didn't even accept the $1000. My father made the choice to not leave me anything, and I respected that choice.", "You got a nominal amount that shows she did not forget to include you.  Leave your SIL alone.\n\nIt says she discussed the reasons for your share with her lawyer.  The lawyer can probably tell you WHY.", "YTA you are not entitled to that money, it is not your money and it never was. Stop hounding your family.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t speak to your grandmother for 10 years and think you\u2019re entitled to her money? Why are you referring to your SIL\u2019s portion as your half when you were left $1000? That\u2019s all you\u2019re entitled to.", "YTA, like possibly one of the biggest ones ever on this page. \n\nFirst of all, it was your GRANDMOTHERS money, which means you are absolutely not in any way shape or form the direct descendant inline for inheritance, your parents are. \n\nSecondly, you chose not to have any kind of relationship with the women. On what planet does that make you entitled to a single dime? You were nothing to her, and she treated you exactly like that.\n\nThirdly, did you fail to read your own message? She is not your EX sister in law, they did not get a divorce. Your brother died and left his wife and children behind. She is your CURRENT sister in law and her children are absolutely entitled to all of those funds to ensure they are provided for since your brother is no longer here to take care of it himself. \n\nThe level of entitlement you have is absolutely astounding. The only good to come of your measly $1,000 inheritance, is it will ensure you do not have the funds to contest the will and try to take that money away from your nieces/nephews...", "YTA. You probably were an AH to your grandparents as well and that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t give you the money.

It's not your money, it never has been.", "YTA- you didn\u2019t talk to your grandmother for 10 years, you are not entitled to anything legally or morally even your lawyer & Mom agree. End of discussion", "YTA\n\nIt was grandma's money to do with as she wished. It sounds like SIL played grandma's game while you weren't speaking to her for 10 years and she went home with the grand prize and you got the consolation prize.", "Op, do you understand what a will is? A will is when the person dying decides what to do with their money. They could choose to leave you money, they chose not to. You are not entitled to money.

It doesn't matter why. You can't cut someone off then expect to get their money when they die. \n\n>I've had a miserable few years and I lost my brother.\n\nSo? She lost her husband and her children lost their father. I'd normally say it isn't a competition, but their loss trumps yours. \n\nGo ahead and fight it. You'll lose. But you won't just lose money, you'll lose the respect of your own family.", ">She said I've been a major dissatisfaction to her over the last years.\n\nOne could see where calling up her son\u2019s widow to scream \u201cgimme your money! Your fatherless kids don\u2019t deserve it!\u201d at her might contribute to your also-bereaved mother\u2018s ongoing disappointment in how you choose to be.\n\nBut that disappointment began somewhere in the choices you made. You knew there would be consequences for choosing to be your own person against the expectations of your family\u2019s norms. When you chose your choices, you chose this too.

She said she was deeply offended by my call. That turned into a shouting match where I may have said something that sounded like I was demanding my half of the money. It makes me sick that a non blood relative is getting that money. She hung up on me and apparently has blocked me. \n\nMy mom called me only a few minutes later and said that I need to walk away and leave my ex-SIL alone. \n\nI need that money. She doesn't and certainly doesn't need my half. I've had a miserable few years and I lost my brother. This money would be life changing to me. \n\nMy mom just called me again and wanted to make sure I wasn't going to bother my SIL again. I said I was looking into my options and no way am I walking away from this. She said I've been a major dissatisfaction to her over the last years. \n\nAITA? Please be honest if you could leave that money alone because I can't and I don't know if that makes me an AH or not.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In fact, I pretty sure you said exactly that in your wedding vows.", ">Also, why so condescending?\n\nIt's reddit, man. Everyone always has to try and disprove what everyone else is saying.\n\nI like to joke that \"everyone is a doctor and an astronaut on reddit\" because someone always has some personal story about how you're wrong \ud83e\udd23"]}
