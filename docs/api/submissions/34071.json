Definitely not during this trip as your dad is stressed enough. Later just give him a hug and tell him you appreciate all his efforts and you are sorry it turned into a train wreck, and you love him, but this was your last trip with your mom. Once you are 18 you can move out and plan time just with the family members you want in your life. You are allowed to protect your mental health and create a stable future for yourself- with healthy adults who can regulate their own emotions.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m very sorry \n\nI understand your love for your dad but just try to look at it differently for a moment \n\nYour dad is allowing this behaviour to continue - he\u2019s enabling it.  He\u2019s allowing her to make you all uncomfortable \n\nI\u2019d make excuses as you suggest until you\u2019re 18\n\nBut I suggest at some point you siblings need to point this out", "NTA - if you\u2019re truly unhappy on these trips, ask not to go. But also, you\u2019re 17 so good luck.", "Why do you have to respect her & keep your mouths shut?  Respect is EARNED, not just blindly given. Why can\u2019t you call her out?  I wouldn\u2019t make it 1/2 a day around someone like that before I would burst w/telling her what a psychopathic c*** she is. Your dad & siblings deserve not to live w/a woman who acts like she\u2019s 5 who missed their midday nap.", "NTA but there can be a balance eventually. By all means miss a few till you have your feet under you but it can still be fun if you get your own hotel room in a different hotel. Meet up with the family to do an activity once a day. If she starts her shit then ditch them to go have fun on your own or with only your siblings and dad. There is a chance that your family will follow your lead of not taking her shit. When you are grown and not under her power then there is chance of establishing a healthier dynamic or at the very least establishing boundaries so her crap is not your problem.", "Nta", "NTA. Do allow some distance between the trip and when you talk to your dad, though. It sounds like everyone is stressed and chances are tensions will still be high for several weeks after the trip. Explain that you really appreciate everything he does but that you cannot travel with your mother anymore. Find ways to spend quality time with just your dad.", "This. Many people stay with toxic partners because they think it's better for the kids to have their parents together. As an adult child of such a situation, I can confirm it sucks. As a parent who left a toxic partner, I can also confirm that my kid is so much happier since we left. Dad is enabling toxic behaviour by staying and he's forcing the kids to be exposed to abuse, which is child abuse regardless of whether it's directed at them (though it seems like it is).\n\nIt took me a lot longer to see how my mother had enabled my father and was equally responsible for my trauma because she was the \"good\" parent. Now I'm more angry at her than him - he was a lost cause, but she could have protected us and chose not to. She was the only adult in the situation with the power to get us safe and she didn't do it. Having left a comparable situation, I get why she stayed and how hard it would have been to leave, but she should have. \n\nOP YWNBTA and you would benefit from reading Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents. Once you're safe from your mother, you should have a conversation with your dad about his role in your trauma. He might wake up to the damage it's causing and act to protect your younger siblings, though I wouldn't pin hopes on that at this point."]}
