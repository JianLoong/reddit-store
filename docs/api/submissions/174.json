She may have taken it as you being annoyed she wasn't moving fast enough or that her wheelchair was in the way. Which is clearly not what you were saying of course, but if she'd had someone say something rude recently she could easily have been primed to take it that way. Not your fault at all, regardless.", "NTA \n\nI actually don't understand why she got so upset. You offered to do it out of politeness and consideration and when you tried to apologise, the family dismissed you. \n\nPerhaps she wanted her independence (although I don't know how she would have moved the chair herself) or maybe she just really wanted one of her family to do it, but IMO she kinda overreacted. \n\nI was in a wheelchair a few years ago and I really liked my independence, but I wouldn't start crying if someone offered to do something for me, I would just politely say I could do it myself and move on.", "NTA\n\nI don't see anything wrong with what you did. My beloved aunt was in a wheelchair until her death several years ago and she either asked them to move a chair so she can roll right up to the table or they/us would just do it for her. She was never offended. My great aunt who was later confined to a wheelchair was the same way and she was a cranky lady but I loved her to pieces.", "NTA. You tried to do the right thing, twice.\n\nAccessibility is really important, and wheelchairs are the most common form of such. Not only is it human decency to offer assistance (bearing in mind anyone is within their right to refuse help), but it was also part of your responsibility as the host to at least offer your hand. Good thing. \n\nThis goes without saying, not everyone takes that well. Many disabled people want to prove they're capable without help, and sometimes it genuinely hurts when that mindset is disturbed. Either that, or it's always just a hurtful reminder. That's definitely not their fault. And I'm sure her family knows how she feels about it firsthand. So when you later tried to apologise, also a good thing, they might've known that it wasn't gonna work.\n\nOf course, I wasn't there so I don't know their attitude. But there's no denying you did the right thing, with the right intentions. Unfortunately the response was stronger than you anticipated and it hurt you too.", "NTA-I use a wheelchair and can honestly say I don\u2019t see anything wrong with what you said.", "NAH\n\nYou tried to be polite. They were upset by that. You tried to apologize. They were upset by that.\n\nSituations like this are full of landmines for the average person but your heart came from a good place.\n\nShe seems to be upset by her condition and my heart goes out to her, but you weren't in the wrong.\n\nIf they'd gotten you in trouble *then* I'd say NTA bc then they were clearly the AH.\n\nJust an unfortunate situation for all. Don't let it weigh you down.", "Nta", "As a person in a wheelchair, we call them \u2018chair\u2019 for simplicity\u2019s sake often. I can see where her confusion lies. Also, we get super sick of being the inconvenience, the difficulty, the thing to be worked around. I get her being upset.  But I can also see you had good intentions. NAH, but maybe think a little about the language.", "Nope you're not just need to clarify which chair it was. I always point and repeat myself for them to hear this is the chair right here you want moved correct. And then they can respond as they should.", "NAH. It seems like a misunderstanding. You were offering to move the resturaunt chair from the table, but she apparently thought you were asking to push her wheelchair.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I intentionally sat her at a table that was half booth, half chairs. When I brought them to the table, I offered to move her chair if it was easier. She said no and I said no problem and left. A bit later, their waiter came up to me and asked me what I did because the lady was crying. I said I did nothing but offer to move her chair. I thought about what to do because I felt really bad for upsetting her. \n\nI walked over to their table and said \u201cI believe their was a misunderstanding and I just wanted to apologize.\u201d Well I started to say that but they cut me off and said that I should just leave. I tried to apologize again but they weren\u2019t having it and told me to leave again. \n\nI was pretty upset after that and tried to hold it together but after another customer was pissed at me because I sat her a table then text to the bathroom, I ended up behind to host desk crying. I was still behind the desk when the family left and didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nWas I the asshole in that situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I didn't even think of that!! Yeah I can understand that being something to be upset over.", "That's what it seemed like upset her. She sat in the chair (not her wheelchair). But like, I didn't know she would do that. And her whole family seemed pissed at me. It was just weird and I can't even fully explain it but it upset me so badly. Like I couldn't talk about it for a week without crying. It was also my mom's birthday that day so we went to dinner and my siblings asked how work was and I was just like \"uh, fine \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude2d\" (I can laugh about that part now)", "I remember the waiter said that she like misheard me. But I don't remember what she thought I said but I don't think it was super far off from what I said. I didn't force it or anything and said it was fine when she said no.", "Thank you. I was worried there was like super offensive thing that everyone in a wheelchair knows about that I didn't.", "Yeah. And I said in another comment that she had a bad experience at a different restaurant", "Noted. I wish I could remember my body language and stuff. I think I pointed to the table chair, but who really knows. And I tried to be super friendly (as I always am). I can see how there was a misunderstanding though.", "You didn't do anything wrong. If they weren't sure what you said then they should have asked you to repeat it.", "Yeah\n\nPerhaps they were recently disabled and still dealing with it. Perhaps it's something they just still haven't come to terms with.\n\nI'm a hard NAH on this one. Sometimes situations such as this don't have a clear AH. As I said, don't let it weigh you down. I don't think you did anything wrong and I think she's entitled to her emotions.\n\nMy opinion will, however, stay tentative until another wheelchair-bound human chimes in. But even then there is no hard and fast rule with people. If you came from a genuine place, then don't sweat it.\n\nI put my foot in my mouth frequently. Sometimes you just gotta accept that not everyone will always be happy with you", "Misunderstanding, my friend. It happens. We never know what is happening in the lives of others - she could have had bad day and her perception was the final straw. Don\u2019t eat yourself up about it.", "Yeah. I just remembered that I guess she had a bad experience at another restaurant so I guess she just assumed the worst. \n\nIt also really didn't help that the lady I sat after her was *definitely* an asshole so I was an emotional wreck the rest of the day.", "I came to terms with that years ago. I famously do and say stupid stuff all the time. But idk, this one hit me really hard. Like it's been almost two years and thinking about it still puts my stomach in a knot.", "That's what the waiter said too. Luckily the people I worked with were super nice and the other host let me talk boy problems for like an hour to get my mind off it.", "Nobody likes being seated next to the bathroom but someone has to take that seat. Lol", "I hostessed for years and always pulled chairs out to make room for people in wheelchairs. I thought that was what we were supposed to do? You did absolutely nothing wrong in this scenario please don't beat yourself up about it. Also people are gonna be jerks and we've all cried in the bathroom/ walk-in at least once. This person had emotional things going on way beyond the actual situation at hand and it was NOT your fault", "Yeah and it wasn't like some gross awful seat! I've sat in that exact spot before and you can't hear the bathroom and the booth backs are high so you barely notice people walking in and out. And they had already asked to be moved because they wanted a booth and that was the only one available!!", "Thanks for that. I worked at that restaurant for six years and that was the only time I cried. (although I got close when a friend told me the busser I had a crush on had a meltdown when he found out. But that was mostly from embarrassment lol)", "Your post has been removed. \n\n#Do not repost this without contacting the mods for approval, including edited versions.
