{"id": 22410, "submission_id": "1516e53", "title": "AITA for not going to my cousins wedding after her fiance's father just passed?", "selftext": "Me (30F) decided I did not want to attend my cousin's (29F) wedding this past weekend. We are not very close, we see each other a few times a year. But always friendly and have had no bad blood between us, until this incident.\n\nMy cousin's soon to be father-in-law passed away very suddenly two months before the wedding. I wrote her and her fiance a very heart felt condolence card, saying I was very sorry for their loss and that I knew exactly how they felt because my own father has just passed away a few months prior and to give me a call anytime if they wanted to talk.\n\nAfter I sent the card, I find out from my Aunt that she had already known about my dad passing and didn't appreciate being made to feel guilty that she never said her condolences to me after my dad died. My Aunt admitted that she had told my cousin about my dad passing away the same day she found out, which was a few days after it happened. I had gotten a card in the mail a week or so after my dad had died. It was from my cousin, I thought it might be a condolence card before I opened it. It turned out to be a save-the-date for her wedding, I broke down crying (for various reasons). I brushed it off, figuring that my Aunt just simply didn't tell her about her Uncles death. I realized that instead of saying her condolences to me about my father, she instead sends me a save-the-date for her wedding a week after he dies.\n\nI still hadn't responded to her wedding invitation and decided I won't be attending any longer. I was hesitant to respond in the first place because I did not know if I was going to be emotionally stable enough to go a wedding after a relativly short time since my dad has passed. Her behavior made my decision easy.", "created_utc": 1689514310, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1516e53/aita_for_not_going_to_my_cousins_wedding_after/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However I would note that it's entirely possible she sent out the save the date cards BEFORE finding out your dad died. Even if she didn't, you were one in a likely large stack of invitations that she sent out. I really don't think there was a decision of \"oh I'm going to send a save the date instead of a condolance card!\"", "NTA This is a hard one. Some people don't know how to react to the death of a parent so they ignore it instead of reaching out. But you are the best judge of yourself and if it doesn't feel right then don't go. Look after you.", "NTA. First off I want to say that I\u2019m very sorry for your loss. Losing a parent is a life shattering situation and I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with that. When it comes to the story, you clearly showed empathy for your cousin situation and were thinking about more than just yourself. I wish the same could be said for your cousin. They\u2019ve clearly show just how much you mean to them. I wouldn\u2019t be going either.", "You don't have to go. You aren't close, a wedding invitation isn't a summons, don't go.", "NTA sorry for your loss...", "So sorry for your loss. NTA", "NTA - too bad she feels guilty that's really not your problem", "NTA.  However, the actual card could have been sent by someone else 'helping' whom had been given a list of names/addresses.  Don't burn that bridge just yet.", "ESH.  This is not about your cousin's fianc\u00e9's father, it is about your father.  You feel slighted that the passing of your father was not acknowledged by your cousin and instead, her wedding invitation showed up.  Wedding invitations are long thought of before anyone's passing, it just so happened to come a week after your father's passing.  Your cousin should have called but a lot of people do not know how to handle death and what is appropriate to do.  Your cousin may have thought that a phone call would just hurt you more.  \n\nYour cousin on the other hand is taking your comment about the two passing's as a slight against her.   You both are in vulnerable states.  The best thing to do is to have a talk with your cousin to clear the air about both of your griefs.  If you want to salvage your relationship, I would go to the wedding, sit in the back and put in an appearance.  You don't have to do more than say congratulations and eat some chicken.  If you want the relationship with your cousin to sour, all you have to do is nothing and not go.  That will speak for itself.", "NTA.", "NTA losing a parent is hard sorry for your loss", "I may not understand. You skipped the wedding because cousin did not send you a condolence card? Seems needlessly petty. YTA", "NTA.", "Nta\n\n it was tacky,  many people don\u2019t know how to respond to death.  But if you care about cousin, make an appearance. I can\u2019t believe fianc\u00e9 would marry that close to a parent death. Many cultures wait a year.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo, or don't go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut all that drama ...", "YTA - I think the fact that you waited until the second half of the story to explain the initial interaction shows that, at some level, you know what you did was petty and cruel.", "Do what you want. It\u2019s an invitation not an order. NTA.", "INFO: How close are you to this cousin? \n\nCause like of my maternal cousins I would send a card or call cause we are all at least pretty close to one another?\n\nPaternal cousins? We have like a \u201cIf we see each other we might wave at most\u201d relationship. \n\nTo me it really depends on your level of relationship.", "No. She did not say a single word to me. I was SHOCKED when I found out she already knew. I posted a tiny bit more background on someone else comment if you want to read that. And that last part of your comment, ty, I didn't think of it that way", "Ugh, I just get so impatient with the idea that *anyone* \"*knows* how to act\" in difficult situations. \n\nNo, they don't. It's hard, its uncomfortable, its awkward for everyone, but jfc, thoughtful adults realize that - surprise! - not everything is about them. So they suck it up and offer a kind word to someone they supposedly care about who's experienced a loss. \n\nHow is it hard to \"know\" to just buy and send a fucking condolence card? If you \"don't *know* what to say\" (eyeroll, who does), Google something, or just sign and send the damned card. I\n\nIgnoring someone's pain because *you* feel awkward is just lazy, unkind, and deeply self-centered. Grow up. <phew, rant over...>", "Thank you", "Thank you", "Thank you", "Thank you", "It you don't look at all the other facts, I suppose that's what it boils down to. I am more upset about how unsupportive she was and knew that my dad had passed and said nothing to me. Not even a single text message, but when I would see her, she only talked about her wedding (I didn't mention that part). I had thought she just simply did not know, and I was not in the mood to say something to her and start crying while at a birthday party for a different family member. I will be skipping the wedding because I do not know how I am going to react while at her wedding. I am still grieving my father and am now angry at her for not having sent her condolences to me. ATM, if I go, there might be another AITA post for ruining her wedding", "Eh, people handle death in different ways. Postponing a wedding after the death of a parent is fine. Going ahead with the wedding is fine. Deaths come in all sorts of ways, which is why grief does to.", "You're welcome"]}
