Is there any help she can get for her behaviours? Sounds like she's borderline neglecting your child and that is massive concern.\n\nYou may need to close down her access to family money while you sort this behaviour out - but you absolutely do need to sort it. This is a dangerous situation for your child and precarious for you financially.\n\nI'm so sorry though mate. This is so tough and I hope you have a good support network.", "NTA. This is a difficult one, tbh, because it seems harsh to say you should leave your wife over her disability. But at the same time, if you phsyically/emotionally/financially cannot handle everything and ensure your child is safe and taken care of, then you need to put your child first. It may be possible that having a baby/toddler in the house is overstimulating for her, leading to the increased fixation on other things. Could working with a therapist help her to find ways to cope, if this is the case?", "It sounds like your wife is actively neglecting your child and doesn\u2019t have the capacity to parent, can you find an alternative childcare provider when you\u2019re at work?", "NTA but she needs help and therapy. Pregnancy and giving birth can lead to a lot of mental issues which could be causing this.", "INFO: Is she in therapy since the birth? Have you tried couples counseling?", "I would look in to adult Autisim services, and maybe consider having her go back to work sooner and put the child in daycare, or getting a caregiver for wife/nanny for child? \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven as husband and wife, it's important to have healthy boundaries, and she is breaking those.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo me, it sounds like you're doing a lot, while she seems to be pushing the boundaries of how much she can pass off to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe have a separate account for the bills?", "[deleted]", "She may have PPD. She needs professional mental help. \n\nIt sounds like maybe you need to make separate bank accounts.", "NTA  \n\n\nOP, you have to do something for the sake of your child, and for yourself.  You can't go on like this.  If your spouse refuses to get help, then you have to do whatever you have to do to protect your child.  \n\n\nI am neurodivergent.  I had PPD.  I know the weight of it, how hard it can be to get out of bed.  I was going to school time and a half, working full time and taking care of an infant that I struggled to bond with.  It's HEAVY.  But even under all that weight, I knew I had to feed and diaper and comfort the living, breathing human being I brought into this world.  That was the choice.  \n\n\nEither your wife is choosing to neglect your child, or she's so far gone that she probably needs inpatient care.  Either way, you can't continue to leave the baby with her.  Eventually something terrible will happen.  \n\n\nAre you able to meet with extended family to try and get more help?  Are they able to help convince her to get help?  \n\n\nI hope your wife is able to get the help they need.  I hope you are able to get the rest and help you need.  I hope your child ends up in the best situation possible and is cared for the way they deserve.", ">i have to worry if she has eaten, if our child has eaten (they spend the morning with my family and the late evenings with wife until i get home) cook for both of them, feed, change, clean dress and put our child to sleep, then basically do the same for her.\n\nInfo: Plot twist, wife sounds like she's severely low functioning autistic who needs constant caregiving. Way more info needed about her levels of functioning independently.\n\n I wanted to make a main comment to address what I've mentioned before. Those don't seem like the actions of a mentally well person. So you're getting her in the bath, changing her clothes, putting her to bed? It just doesn't make sense.....\nThe other option is she is severely depressed and stuck in PPD. She may need hospitalization if that's actually what's happening.", "NTA, but if she isn't already in therapy or counseling, this should be considered. Couple's counseling could help if you both think it could help. As an autistic person, I get your wife's want to buy things relating to her intrests, even when it negatively affects myself (not having enough money, not actually needing it, ect) and you should have a talk about it as well. I do feel bad for you OP, because this situation does suck, and your wife has to get help. Soft Y-T-A for how you said it.   \nhope this was worded right </3", "NTA..your wife is immature and maybe you underestimated her special needs sadly. I'd suggest you talk to your family Dr and ask his advice on how you can cope in this situation...it's exhausting being a parent but caring for an adult too must be hell. Take control of the finances and give her a budget to start with so you don't find yourself under more financial pressures.", "NTA \n\nI am autistic and know in myself the things I can and can't do. I talked extensively with my family and friends about having a child and they are all on board to help when I need it. When autistic it definitely takes a village to raise a child. \n\nIt sounds like your wife definitely needs help. Is there maybe a person you can bring in when they are not with family like a nanny or babysitter?", "Nta.\n\nShe needs help. If she won't get help, like I've seen in your comments, then you have to figure out if you even want to be with her.\n\nDoes she have family you can talk to? That she'd listen to? \n\nAs for the money, she's impulse buying. I don't know how your finances work, but bills need to be separated into another account.", "NTA\n\nClearly your wife is struggling to adjust to parenthood and desperately needs some help, because right now it sounds like she is neglecting your child. Her autism may be fuelling this behaviour, but she could also be suffering from post-natal depression and she urgently needs to seek advice from her doctor.\n\nMeanwhile, extra support needs to be put in place so you're not burning yourself out with worry. Can her family help out at all? Are there organisations available that can support you all?", "ESH. Get her help before she goes off the deep end. That is deep depression and having it right after a baby is indicative of a much larger problem. You've been watching this for almost 2 years and only cared the times that it embarrassed you? FFS  Unpack that with a therapist at your earliest convenience too.", "[deleted]", "NTA for wanting to straighten things up. Soft YTA for how you phrased it. Did you think about therapy or counseling? I'm not in a country where therapy is a catch-all, but it really seems your case is one that would benefit from it.", "NTA, but it sounds like she is suffering from post partum depression. She needs help. You may need to ultimatum her, but she has to get help sooner rather than later.", "Dude, it sounds like your wife has severe PPD. Stop assuming her behaviour is down to autism and get her help", "I\u2019m super curious if anybody commenting on this is Autistic themselves. I am Autistic, married, and also a parent. With that being said, YTA. And let me clarify why.\n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole for being upset she spent the rent money on Halloween costumes. That\u2019s super valid, and I want that to be heard. But it sounds like your wife is suffering from Autistic burnout. I highly suggest you consider reading up on this if you\u2019ve never heard of it. It could also be some postpartum stuff. Mixed together and who knows what could happen. Both are very, very serious and should not be taken lightly. It sounds like your wife needs help. Help that goes beyond you telling her to \u201cgrow up\u201d which is super shitty and actually not helpful to anyone \u2014 including you. Professional help is definitely something to consider. Especially if postpartum is on the table. I don\u2019t think a lot of people realize these things can lead to psychosis. When people, especially neurodivergent people, are suffering from burnout or postpartum you have to understand they cannot control about 98% of their actions. So even tho most of these things seem like a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to you, YOUR WIFE CLEARLY IS NOT IN HER RIGHT MIND. I put this in all caps to really put emphasis on the situation. \n\nI also want to point out that the way you speak about your wife and how she takes care of your child is off-putting to me. You clearly knew she was Autistic before having a child with her. If you were concerned about how she would parent then I hope this was something that was discussed before you decided to have children, or at least when she found out y\u2019all were expecting. If you yourself are not Autistic then you just really can\u2019t fathom how difficult life is on a day to day basis. Now add being a parent on top of that. Nobody teaches us how to be parents. Hell, they don\u2019t even teach us how to be people. \n\nKeeping that in mind, it also sounds like you may be suffering from caretaker burnout. Which is also super real and valid. Being a caretaker is never easy. I want to recognize and acknowledge that as someone who has been on both ends of it. But if you sign up for it you have to be prepared for it to get bad. And I mean really bad. \n\nI think you both should consider individual counseling and perhaps even couples counseling. Either way, I would absolutely make an appointment with her OBGYN or regular doctor immediately (preferably whichever one is a woman) and try and get her on track before she accidentally hurts herself, or even the baby if that\u2019s something you\u2019re truly concerned about. Please know that the healthcare system wants disabled people to fail. Like. It wants that. So you may need to be prepared to really fight to get her the help she needs. Be that long term or not. Especially being that she\u2019s a woman. Please, if you take away nothing else from my comment, let it be this. Men do not realize how much easier it is to get diagnosis or access to medicines, etc. \n\nAlso, Autism is genetic so PLEASE get any children you have together tested right away. The earlier they know, the better. The better for everyone. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ll be thinking of your wife. Wishing you all the luck.", "just a tiny yta", "I\u2019m torn\nOP you suck for how you phrased it but I understand so I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH\n\nHowever, you said she was fine before giving birth but has gotten much worse after. Is this really her autism or maybe possibly PPD? It takes a good year after birth for the hormones to get back to normal. So maybe she is struggling with that. Please don\u2019t assume it\u2019s the autism when it could be postpartum depression.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While my situation isn\u2019t quite as dire as yours sounds to be, I am finally coming out of a few really, really difficult months. There were times I felt on the precipice of a full breakdown without the words to explain it and just fully shut down. I wished someone would just see and DO something. Thankfully a med adjustment a few weeks ago seems to be working and Im doing much, much better. \n\nThe safety of your child and then the safety of your wife are your first and foremost obligations. Your wife\u2019s behaviors are neglectful, full stop. Though it may not be her fault if it is a PPD/PPA/PPP situation, it\u2019s still an unsafe environment for your child. Also, if you have any inkling she may want to intentionally harm herself or your child you need to take steps to medically and legally intervene. \n\nIf I were you, I would say a therapy appointment and full medical evaluation would be absolute non negotiables.

And you should, too. It\u2019s not about wanting or even not wanting to do things. It\u2019s about having the Spoons, if you will. (Consider reading into the Spoon Theory to understand what I\u2019m saying.) Many people who have ASD apply it to their lives, as well. Some days we just don\u2019t have the spoons, so to speak. I can\u2019t tell you how many things I wanted to do but couldn\u2019t. And yes \u2014 it was absolutely because of my Autism. Whether it\u2019s doing my daily chores or going to my best friends college graduation. \n\nMany Autistic people don\u2019t wash their clothes. They don\u2019t wash their hair. They don\u2019t clean their house. They don\u2019t clean their car. They don\u2019t feed themselves. Etc. You have to understand that with some of these things it\u2019s really just a matter of it not being in their radar. For example, having a clean car just may not feel important to them and therefore it\u2019s not something they ever think about. Even if someone told them to clean their car.", "Bruh that\u2019s not how autism works. Neurodivergence sucks and it\u2019s very dependent on how your brain is day to day. \n\nIm not diagnosed with autism but I do have ADHD with a suspicion of being on the spectrum and some days I can absolutely do the dishes and others my brain says no, it\u2019s too overwhelmed and overstimulated for that brand of executive function.

Yes, OP knew she was autistic before having a child together, but I don't think anyone can reasonably expect that a person will completely change after having a child; that they will refuse to participate in the care of that child or themself; that they'll refuse to contribute in any meaningful way to the family or relationship.  \n\n\nIt's interesting that you're worried about the wife getting psychosis but ignoring that the same thing can happen to OP doing what they are doing.  You excuse the wife's neglect bc they are autistic and have 'autistic burnout', but call OP an AH for suffering something similar.  \n\n\nAlso, let me point out that OP never agreed to be their wife's caregiver.  That was not a conversation they had.  OP agreed to be their wife's spouse.  These are not the same thing!  OP has been forced, without consent, into a caregiver relationship with their spouse, and their spouse refuses to get help.   \n\n\nIf a person has a child, refuses to care for that child, refuses to get the help they need to get to a point where they can care for themself or that child... what do you think is reasonable?  A life of servitude for OP?

This is gonna sound rude, but that's a relatively short amount of time buddy. \n\n Also, you're either severely underrating her Autism and how independently functioning your wife is, or underestimating how much the depression is affecting and changing her.\n\nYou consistently say you need to \"take care of her\" like you're a caregiver. What do you mean by that??\n\n*Edit! The irony that this comment gets downvoted while my main comment saying the EXACT same thing gets up voted shows how utterly ridiculous y'all are.*", "Time for an ultimatum, she's a wreck and needs help.", "I do think he could handle it better, yes. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that he may also be suffering from burnout. But caregiver burnout and autistic burnout are two very different things. And postpartum depression, psychosis, etc, hell \u2014 these things don\u2019t even compare. That\u2019s how serious it is. Soooo many people fail to realize how scary postpartum can be and the things it can make someone do. Her \u201crefusal\u201d to do things is literally that. I highly doubt she WANTS to be parenting this way right now. So, yes. I am SUPER worried about all of this leading to psychosis for her. And yes, even him. People have been known to snap for less. I will say, refusing help is a big indicator a person is not in their right mind and DOES in fact need help. Unfortunately this is how many people end up in psych. I hope for both of their sakes it doesn\u2019t get that far. But how do you know OP didn\u2019t agree to be her caregiver? He never explicitly said they didn\u2019t have that conversation, just as he didn\u2019t say whether or not they talked about what being a parent would mean for her as an autist. I mean, marrying someone who is that type of neurodivergent or even disabled comes with that. These types of people are not always able to take care of themselves. Sometimes these marriages are not always 50/50. With that being said, when did I ever say this is REASONABLE???? Lmao. I literally spend my entire comment talking about how she needs help \u2014 and fast. I also didn\u2019t say he signed up for a life of servitude but I do think being with someone who is neurodivergent or even disabled is grossly, deeply misunderstood. If you are dating someone who has a condition of sorts and you plan to be in it for the long haul, the least you could do is educate yourself about said condition before getting into it, before you BOTH get hurt. Because YES!!!!! Caregiver burnout is just as real and valid. As I said before. But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t kinda shitty to suddenly switch up on your partner because something has changed and you can\u2019t deal anymore. And y\u2019all really aren\u2019t gonna like this one but it IS kinda shitty to leave your partner if they are disabled when you did in fact \u201csign up for this\u201d by choosing to be in a committed, long-term relationship with them.", "NTA but telling her to grow up isn\u2019t constructive and won\u2019t get you to where you want to be. Get her evaluated for PP and look for a therapist for her. If she isn\u2019t willing to work on herself you need to take your baby and go.

You need to have a separate bank account where only you have access to that you can put funds that can't be touched in. Like rent/bills. Anything over that can go in the 'joint' account, but if she's not working/contributing, not watching your child, and putting you potentially in debt or at risk of homelessness, she's burned her bridge to walk across to get funds for fun time. It sucks you have to put things like that, but it'll protect you in the long run.

I read she refuses therapy, to me that is a red flag. She is alone with the baby for 3 hours a day... what if the baby cries and she gets overwhelmed and hurts the child in that time?

You did great communicating with her and making sure her needs were met before the birth & having been a nanny before I got my ADHD and autism diagnosed, it's hard fucking work.

Even before I was diagnosed with autism, I knew my limits. I like kids. People are confused when I didn't have one, after making it my career for more than a decade... I honestly... I would've been way way worse than your wife. Chronic PAIN means I fail to feed myself / clean my teeth / the house.\n\n\n\n\nSeriously, sleep deprivation in autistic people can be fucking ...BREAKDOWN LEVEL BAD. She's not coping.

It's definitely worth looking up.

I know billions of other autistic people who are able to get up, get dressed, go to work and take care of their kids. Why did OP marry someone they have to take care of like a child? It would totally ruin any romantic feelings I may have had about that person if it's like having a child you have to feed, dress, and watch constantly. It sounds like the wife and baby are going to family members to be babysat?  Why not send her to life skills mental health programs to help her learn how to adult instead of treating her like a baby? She isn't stupid, I guarantee it and I think a lot of the helplessness is learned helplessness from people always babying her due to her condition. ESH in my opinion here. She's an adult with a mental disability, but she is capable of taking care of herself if she is allowed. I have a feeling she went right from helicopter parents of an autistic kid that take care of her to a husband that takes care of her so she has never learned how to be an adult. She always has had the excuse that she's autistic when she doesn't do anything right. Me and gazillions of other autistic people who get up and go to work and function mostly as normal people prove it CAN be done.

I think the comments are spot on regarding what may be going on with your wife, and good suggestions regarding getting help and separating finances (or at least putting rent and utilities money aside in an account she can\u2019t access - it\u2019s not financial abuse to keep someone from spending the money that literally keeps the roof over your head and the lights on). However, if your wife is unwilling to participate in getting help for herself, it\u2019s not an immediate solution to the immediate emergency problem. That may be a more medium-term thing that will take more time to convince her to pursue. \n\nSo, do you have anyone, anyone you trust (or a rotation of multiple people) who can step in to fill that three hour period where your family can\u2019t watch the baby? That seems to be the immediate, urgent issue - get your child out of danger. Is your work flexible? Can you change shifts/work times to better coincide with your family\u2019s availability? WFH for part of the day? ANY options you can think of to just address that three hour period? Does your family know what is going on? If not, would them knowing lead to their ability/willingness to shift their schedules to cover that three hour period knowing it\u2019s a temporary emergency situation? If you can start by addressing that, get your child out of danger, I think that would alleviate a lot of stress for you and maybe free up greater mental and emotional capacity to start addressing other things.\n\nIn regards to your wife, in the short term, does she really need to be bathed every day? To have you change her cloths every evening? Will she not eat until she\u2019s literally starved herself to death? The eating thing obviously is a necessity, but just trying to gauge her state and abilities here. Generally everyone eats when they get hungry enough, but is she that far into a spiral that she will literally not feed herself for days if you don\u2019t do it? And I bring up the bathing and cloths because I know most of us *like* to bathe every day, and have clean cloths, but it\u2019s not a necessity. It\u2019s not going to harm her to bathe every other or even every third day, and same with changing clothing. Doing this every single night sounds like it\u2019s way too much with all other things considered, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually necessary if we\u2019re prioritizing tasks. \n\nTLDR: I guess long story short, start with 1) addressing through any creative means possible to get coverage for those three hours a day; 2) cut back on the evening duties for your wife - not out of cruelty or neglect of her, but out of realistic \u201cwill this harm her\u201d standards; food is a necessity daily, bathing and changing cloths isn\u2019t. Once the immediate concern of child safety is addressed and you are able to free yourself from some of the weight of evening duties, you can then start to work on all the other things people have suggested.

SIL is basically aloof when it comes to their child, unless it\u2019s, like OP said, related to one of her niche interests.

If the root cause isn't addressed, it's going to spiral even more out of control than it already is. PPD and autistic burnout have different treatments and treating for one when the other is what needs to be treated isn't going to help. \n\nChances are this is some combination of the two -- and it could be that each is exacerbating the other. I don't think an inpatient facility is what's needed, but she definitely does need therapy. She needs to learn new coping methods. It sounds like she's got at least some support network because OP mentioned that they're with family during the morning, so it might be beneficial to find a way to redirect that support so that it's more focused on helping her in the ways she actually needs. \n\nOP is NTA for the way he's feeling. He's working hard and he's understandably exhausted. He feels like he's at the end of his rope and that's a natural feeling right now, it's ok for him to feel that way.

Inpatient is reserved for people who are a threat to themselves or others. OP\u2019s wife, while in need of support, is not on that level. I think she does need regular therapy and likely some sort of in home social services, either disability or CPS (NOT to remove child, to visit and provide parenting education).", "Admission for inpatient care, which is extremely unlikely for these circumstances even though mental health care appears absolutely necessary, still won\u2019t address the issue of child care.", "OP has articulated NO reason for his wife to be involuntarily committed. Wow.", "Functional capacity is a pretty dynamic thing for someone with autism and can fluctuate wildly depending on wide range of factors; stability of their living situation, exposure to stimuli, imposed pressure/obligations, social exposure, support structures and coping strategies inplace and many more, almost all of which will have been pretty dramatically upended by pregnancy, birth and parenting.\nSomeone with autism is likely to have periods of their life in which they are more functional than others and it can be a really vicious cycle.\n\nTo see someone with autism \"functioning\" well and assume it can only get better is an easy trap to fall into, a lot of people forget it's a fluctuating disability that varies greatly from one individual to the other.\n\nWhat you're saying about PPD is valid though, but wife is autistic and as a result the 2 conditions won't exist independently from each other, they will intertwine and effect their functional capacity, expecting otherwise is not exactly reasonable if you're treating ASD as a disability rather than a personality quirk, it's a crucially relevant factor here.\nDepression in a clinical sense is something you can expect most people with ASD to experience at some point in their life, if not a constant issue; burnout being a primary trigger. PPD is a realistic risk factor that will upend the coping strategies they spent years, possibly decades developing.\n\nIt doesn't help anyone to say this now, but it sounds like there maybe wasn't adequate consideration of how the introduction of an infant into their life was going to effect these things, chances are she didn't see it coming herself.", "True. But NTs aren\u2019t subject to ASD burnout, which people with ASD are.", "I mostly agree with you but I will say as a child welfare worker we do still need this terminology over in pediatrics land.  For example when kids enter the foster care system there are different levels of foster care, and specifically trained individuals for medically or behaviorally complex kiddos. A child who is mildly autistic but meets typical developmental milestones can usually go into general foster care. Whereas a child who is nonverbal, melting down several times a day and meeting little to no milestones needs a higher level of care. In this case functioning levels are extremely important so we can ensure the child is going to a qualified caregiver. Most people signing up to foster do not know how to properly support the latter child. If you visit r/fosterparents unfortunately there are no shortage of inexperienced, even first time foster parents being placed with children that are FAR outside of their skill level.", "Worked with kids with special needs for years. There's obviously a MAJOR difference between the kids with autism that are basically non-verbal, still in diapers at 10+ years old, and require assistance with every basic task vs. the kids with autism that have a big vocabulary, are potty-trained, and can do most basic tasks independently. I'd definitely describe that as high functioning/low functioning.", "I have ID twins with autism. One is in college and one is non verbal and often hits himself in the head until he bleeds when he has a meltdown.  He will need 24/7 care the rest of his life.   You honestly think there is no difference between functioning levels in my children?   What words do you suggest I use to describe the difference in my twins' abilities?", "Exactly.", "He is the sole income, the primary caregiver for the child, and taking care of the wife. That's just not feasible for anyone.", "Or maybe since she's autistic and experiencing autistic burnout and likely post-partum depression at the same time, get more support for her so she can stabilize.", "I have to disagree with this take. \n\nOther people have gone into more detail already, but this sounds like a mix of autistic burnout and PPD. She needs therapy for both. She needs to learn new coping methods, and she needs to be given a dedicated space to decompress for a bit each day. It sounds like she has at least some support network because OP mentioned that they're with family in the mornings, but if that support network could be redirected to help her in ways that specifically help alleviate some of the burnout, there's still hope for recovery. \n\n\"Document the neglect, file for divorce, and get full custody with supervised visitation\" is the nuclear option and it makes things worse for everyone. OP clearly loves his wife and his child, he's just *also* under too much pressure right now. He needs support. His wife needs therapy and her support network needs to be modified to accommodate her specific needs as a person with autism. They can work through this and grow *together* as a family.", "There are very few child care options for evening care.", "Don\u2019t know where OP is located but even if he\u2019s in a country without robust child welfare services he still needs to consider your point.\n\nGod forbid if something were to happen, authorities will be none too pleased to hear OP and the rest of the family have known about Mom\u2019s issues for a while and still left child alone with her.", "There's no medication for Autism. And therapy is just for assistance, not for actual \"treatment\".", "I'm at the other end of that. My SO had to threaten me with kicking me out before I finally went to the doctor.\n\nYears later we're happily married with a nine year old daughter, I take regular medication and go to therapy when things get rough.

I know it\u2019s a hard situation to be in but please try and get some help for your wife, it sounds like she seriously needs it\n\nND folk face this a lot, as do most people with significant mental health issues falling into that \"invisible illness\" category.\n\nAs a psychological concept this is known as attribution bias, we make biased assumptions (usually out of fear or frustration) about a person's motives or reasons for particular behaviours.\nIt's not a crime, everyone does it, but if you ignore all context and go for that initial gut feeling, you often wrongly assign negative attributes were they don't belong. This is further exacerbated in social media where we never get the full context of events and behaviours.\n\nIt's far easier to ascend attribution bias when someone is missing an arm or in a wheelchair, but when it's something like ASD (especially when they they present as \"high functioning\") people often fall into the trap of thinking they can adequately assess these behaviours because they don't outwardly appear to be all that different to us.\nA lot of people really have trouble appreciating exactly how different it is to be autistic than to be NT.", "If you've met one autistic person, you've met one autistic person. Each has an individual set of challenges and struggles so you can't compare them. Having a baby is a HUGE change which can throw us off for a long time. Tbh it does sound like autistic burnout which may mean she is incapable of caring for anyone (herself included). She's probably CONSTANTLY overstimulated by the baby which can keep her in that burnout state. Spending money on something she likes it's probably the only feeling of joy she gets. And mindlessly scrolling on the phone can be a stim. This whole family needs help instead of blaming the person suffering the most.", "I must have missed that part.\n\nIf that is true, then it's 100% PPD and he's absolutely TA for blaming PPD on autism.", "I just don\u2019t enjoy seeing those words thanks for asking", "Nether of those picked if people lived or died though", "It\u2019s more impulsive than immaturity but I see your point.", "Because your first message comes across as the typical ableist propaganda of 'if you're not completely blending in you aren't doing enough'. You might not mean it that way but that's what it implies. Yes, she needs attention and help but disabilities are disabilities.", "Snapping was justified. He's human, she's not pulling her weight and putting the family at risk.", "What could he do better? He sounds like he has given all he has, that he is at the end of his rope, and that's why he snapped.  I don't think I'd be off base to assert that OP is doing the best he can.  \n\n\nNo, OP didn't explicitly say whether or not he talked about being his wife's caregiver, but it's implied that this isn't something he wants to do.  Whether or not they talked about what being an autistic parent would look like, it absolutely sounds like that whatever the expectation was is not being met.  \n\n\nI get that not everyone can read between the lines or infer tone through word choice. At the same time, I don't think it's particularly wise to use that lack of ability as a weapon.  \"OP didn't exactly say X, so Y must be true\" is disingenuous.   \n\n\nAlso, the real irony here is that not only am I multiply neurodivergent (PTSD, ADHD), not only have I lived through severe PPD, but I am also Disabled.  I have multiple, progressive illnesses that are incurable and barely understood.  \nMost of your argument here is based on \"BUT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS\".  I get it.  I understand.  I even have a form of synesthesia that makes it difficult to not put myself in OP's wife's shoes.  \n\n\nAnd yes, it's shitty if someone leaves their partner if they get cancer, or lose a limb, or end up otherwise disabled but is otherwise the same person.  Not so shitty?  Leaving someone to protect your child.  Leaving someone who has so severely neglected the terms and boundaries of the relationship that it is now causing you physical and emotional harm.  \n\n\nI think about this a lot!  I think about my partner, who agreed to be my caretaker, and how every day he has the choice to stay or go.  I feel a little sorrow thinking about the potentially easier life he could have without me, and full of joy that he continues, day after day, to choose me.  But it's a CHOICE, not an obligation; and I do all I can to make it easier for him to continue to choose me.  I don't think that's very different from abled relationships, to be honest.

I couldn't tell you what I read or watched an hour ago, it's just mentally shutting off for a while. That's how I self regulate and reset my head.\n\n**I want to be clear here: what she's doing is not ok at all.** I'm bolding that part for emphasis because just because I resonate with her actions does not mean I think it's ok. I'm not trying to make excuses for her, what she's doing is wrong. For them to have any shot at all of coming out of this together, she needs to find new methods of coping that don't involve retail therapy or totally tuning out the world for hours on end while her baby is left unattended in a crib.", "I don't think we will agree with each other about this. I come from a place of having ADHD and living with the struggles of that, so likely I identify far more with the struggling mother and prefer a route of getting her help rather than taking away the child and ending the relationship. Something is wrong here, she's clearly very unwell. There needs to be a medical intervention.", "100%. Unfortunately, it\u2019s almost impossible to force someone into therapy outside of very specific circumstances. And forcing someone into therapy generally doesn\u2019t work well. They have to want to get better.\n\nHonestly, I suspect this will end in divorce if something doesn\u2019t change soon.", "If her baby starves to death the court is going to also need to look at the husband as he's there too and he doesn't appear to have any mental incapacity. All this is moot anyway because they CAN and SHOULD be seeking help now that they know she cannot cope. Telling her to grow up won't fix it, but actually speaking to some professionals might.", "Yep, I'm autistic and that's part of why I never tried to have kids. I think she's being irresponsible. She chose to have that child, she needs to do something so she's not neglecting them.", "I agree she's unwell and needs help, however someone who doesn't want help usually can't be helped. I'm not suggesting she never be allowed to see her kid again or anything, just that the situation has come to a point where it's not healthy for OP and the baby to stay with her, so removing themselves from the situation might be for the best.", "With forcing I was thinking of an ultimatum. Either therapy or divorce, take your pick.", "They just said they wouldn\u2019t assume that.", "He says in his comments that she is refusing to go to therapy. And she is only looking after the kid for three hours a day in the evening, kid is being looked after by family during the day.", "She only looks after the kid for three hours a day according to his comments.", "And maybe this mom didn't know what to expect.  Maybe her exposure to children was limited before she had her child.  Possibly she's suffering from postpartum blues or postpartum depression on top of autistic burnout.  We don't know.  What she needs is help figuring out how to parent with whatever is going on with her - not to be told to \"grow up.\"   I get it's tough for OP right now; it's probably pretty tough for his wife too.  They need help with coping strategies, especially the wife.  Lecturing her and shaming her aren't going to solve the problem.", "Caring for your child is the absolute highest priority. Seems like having a baby wasn\u2019t a good idea for them, but did it anyway.", "So, I'm autistic.\n\nI have previously been the care giver for a dying relative, their untrained dog (now my dog), and three cats (one of which was 23 and special needs) simultaneously while working full time. \n\nIf someone is physically incapable of adulting when stressed it's their job to not do things like take on stressful adult responsibilities like children. Ones right to reproduce does not overweight the right of a child to be raised by loving, responsible parents."]}
