Is there any help she can get for her behaviours? Sounds like she's borderline neglecting your child and that is massive concern.\n\nYou may need to close down her access to family money while you sort this behaviour out - but you absolutely do need to sort it. This is a dangerous situation for your child and precarious for you financially.\n\nI'm so sorry though mate. This is so tough and I hope you have a good support network.", "NTA. This is a difficult one, tbh, because it seems harsh to say you should leave your wife over her disability. But at the same time, if you phsyically/emotionally/financially cannot handle everything and ensure your child is safe and taken care of, then you need to put your child first. It may be possible that having a baby/toddler in the house is overstimulating for her, leading to the increased fixation on other things. Could working with a therapist help her to find ways to cope, if this is the case?", "It sounds like your wife is actively neglecting your child and doesn\u2019t have the capacity to parent, can you find an alternative childcare provider when you\u2019re at work?", "NTA but she needs help and therapy. Pregnancy and giving birth can lead to a lot of mental issues which could be causing this.", "INFO: Is she in therapy since the birth? Have you tried couples counseling?", "I would look in to adult Autisim services, and maybe consider having her go back to work sooner and put the child in daycare, or getting a caregiver for wife/nanny for child? \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven as husband and wife, it's important to have healthy boundaries, and she is breaking those.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo me, it sounds like you're doing a lot, while she seems to be pushing the boundaries of how much she can pass off to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe have a separate account for the bills?", "several of the closest people in my life are autistic and I have ADHD and so I can say your wife is just irresponsible. Disability to be sure makes life harder, but not impossible. Especially if you actively try better yourself and learn how to navigate and coexist with your neurodivergence. Doesn't seem like shes even aware that's something she should be doing", "She may have PPD. She needs professional mental help. \n\nIt sounds like maybe you need to make separate bank accounts.", "NTA  \n\n\nOP, you have to do something for the sake of your child, and for yourself.  You can't go on like this.  If your spouse refuses to get help, then you have to do whatever you have to do to protect your child.  \n\n\nI am neurodivergent.  I had PPD.  I know the weight of it, how hard it can be to get out of bed.  I was going to school time and a half, working full time and taking care of an infant that I struggled to bond with.  It's HEAVY.  But even under all that weight, I knew I had to feed and diaper and comfort the living, breathing human being I brought into this world.  That was the choice.  \n\n\nEither your wife is choosing to neglect your child, or she's so far gone that she probably needs inpatient care.  Either way, you can't continue to leave the baby with her.  Eventually something terrible will happen.  \n\n\nAre you able to meet with extended family to try and get more help?  Are they able to help convince her to get help?  \n\n\nI hope your wife is able to get the help they need.  I hope you are able to get the rest and help you need.  I hope your child ends up in the best situation possible and is cared for the way they deserve.", ">i have to worry if she has eaten, if our child has eaten (they spend the morning with my family and the late evenings with wife until i get home) cook for both of them, feed, change, clean dress and put our child to sleep, then basically do the same for her.\n\nInfo: Plot twist, wife sounds like she's severely low functioning autistic who needs constant caregiving. Way more info needed about her levels of functioning independently.\n\n I wanted to make a main comment to address what I've mentioned before. Those don't seem like the actions of a mentally well person. So you're getting her in the bath, changing her clothes, putting her to bed? It just doesn't make sense.....\nThe other option is she is severely depressed and stuck in PPD. She may need hospitalization if that's actually what's happening.", "NTA, but if she isn't already in therapy or counseling, this should be considered. Couple's counseling could help if you both think it could help. As an autistic person, I get your wife's want to buy things relating to her intrests, even when it negatively affects myself (not having enough money, not actually needing it, ect) and you should have a talk about it as well. I do feel bad for you OP, because this situation does suck, and your wife has to get help. Soft Y-T-A for how you said it.   \nhope this was worded right </3", "NTA..your wife is immature and maybe you underestimated her special needs sadly. I'd suggest you talk to your family Dr and ask his advice on how you can cope in this situation...it's exhausting being a parent but caring for an adult too must be hell. Take control of the finances and give her a budget to start with so you don't find yourself under more financial pressures.", "NTA \n\nI am autistic and know in myself the things I can and can't do. I talked extensively with my family and friends about having a child and they are all on board to help when I need it. When autistic it definitely takes a village to raise a child. \n\nIt sounds like your wife definitely needs help. Is there maybe a person you can bring in when they are not with family like a nanny or babysitter?", "Nta.\n\nShe needs help. If she won't get help, like I've seen in your comments, then you have to figure out if you even want to be with her.\n\nDoes she have family you can talk to? That she'd listen to? \n\nAs for the money, she's impulse buying. I don't know how your finances work, but bills need to be separated into another account.", "NTA\n\nClearly your wife is struggling to adjust to parenthood and desperately needs some help, because right now it sounds like she is neglecting your child. Her autism may be fuelling this behaviour, but she could also be suffering from post-natal depression and she urgently needs to seek advice from her doctor.\n\nMeanwhile, extra support needs to be put in place so you're not burning yourself out with worry. Can her family help out at all? Are there organisations available that can support you all?", "ESH. Get her help before she goes off the deep end. That is deep depression and having it right after a baby is indicative of a much larger problem. You've been watching this for almost 2 years and only cared the times that it embarrassed you? FFS  Unpack that with a therapist at your earliest convenience too.", "[deleted]", "NTA for wanting to straighten things up. Soft YTA for how you phrased it. Did you think about therapy or counseling? I'm not in a country where therapy is a catch-all, but it really seems your case is one that would benefit from it.", "NTA, but it sounds like she is suffering from post partum depression. She needs help. You may need to ultimatum her, but she has to get help sooner rather than later.", "Dude, it sounds like your wife has severe PPD. Stop assuming her behaviour is down to autism and get her help", "I\u2019m super curious if anybody commenting on this is Autistic themselves. I am Autistic, married, and also a parent. With that being said, YTA. And let me clarify why.\n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole for being upset she spent the rent money on Halloween costumes. That\u2019s super valid, and I want that to be heard. But it sounds like your wife is suffering from Autistic burnout. I highly suggest you consider reading up on this if you\u2019ve never heard of it. It could also be some postpartum stuff. Mixed together and who knows what could happen. Both are very, very serious and should not be taken lightly. It sounds like your wife needs help. Help that goes beyond you telling her to \u201cgrow up\u201d which is super shitty and actually not helpful to anyone \u2014 including you. Professional help is definitely something to consider. Especially if postpartum is on the table. I don\u2019t think a lot of people realize these things can lead to psychosis. When people, especially neurodivergent people, are suffering from burnout or postpartum you have to understand they cannot control about 98% of their actions. So even tho most of these things seem like a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to you, YOUR WIFE CLEARLY IS NOT IN HER RIGHT MIND. I put this in all caps to really put emphasis on the situation. \n\nI also want to point out that the way you speak about your wife and how she takes care of your child is off-putting to me. You clearly knew she was Autistic before having a child with her. If you were concerned about how she would parent then I hope this was something that was discussed before you decided to have children, or at least when she found out y\u2019all were expecting. If you yourself are not Autistic then you just really can\u2019t fathom how difficult life is on a day to day basis. Now add being a parent on top of that. Nobody teaches us how to be parents. Hell, they don\u2019t even teach us how to be people. \n\nKeeping that in mind, it also sounds like you may be suffering from caretaker burnout. Which is also super real and valid. Being a caretaker is never easy. I want to recognize and acknowledge that as someone who has been on both ends of it. But if you sign up for it you have to be prepared for it to get bad. And I mean really bad. \n\nI think you both should consider individual counseling and perhaps even couples counseling. Either way, I would absolutely make an appointment with her OBGYN or regular doctor immediately (preferably whichever one is a woman) and try and get her on track before she accidentally hurts herself, or even the baby if that\u2019s something you\u2019re truly concerned about. Please know that the healthcare system wants disabled people to fail. Like. It wants that. So you may need to be prepared to really fight to get her the help she needs. Be that long term or not. Especially being that she\u2019s a woman. Please, if you take away nothing else from my comment, let it be this. Men do not realize how much easier it is to get diagnosis or access to medicines, etc. \n\nAlso, Autism is genetic so PLEASE get any children you have together tested right away. The earlier they know, the better. The better for everyone. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ll be thinking of your wife. Wishing you all the luck.", "just a tiny yta", "I\u2019m torn\nOP you suck for how you phrased it but I understand so I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH\n\nHowever, you said she was fine before giving birth but has gotten much worse after. Is this really her autism or maybe possibly PPD? It takes a good year after birth for the hormones to get back to normal. So maybe she is struggling with that. Please don\u2019t assume it\u2019s the autism when it could be postpartum depression.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While my situation isn\u2019t quite as dire as yours sounds to be, I am finally coming out of a few really, really difficult months. There were times I felt on the precipice of a full breakdown without the words to explain it and just fully shut down. I wished someone would just see and DO something. Thankfully a med adjustment a few weeks ago seems to be working and Im doing much, much better. \n\nThe safety of your child and then the safety of your wife are your first and foremost obligations. Your wife\u2019s behaviors are neglectful, full stop. Though it may not be her fault if it is a PPD/PPA/PPP situation, it\u2019s still an unsafe environment for your child. Also, if you have any inkling she may want to intentionally harm herself or your child you need to take steps to medically and legally intervene. \n\nIf I were you, I would say a therapy appointment and full medical evaluation would be absolute non negotiables. If you cannot quickly get in with an OBGYN or Primary care, you should really evaluate if you think she would have enough symptoms for a psychological hold at the hospital. Please don\u2019t wait for it to get worse or for her to snap out of it.", "Absolutely agree with Asshole Aficionado.\n\nNTA and you really do need to take action. What's happening is not ok.

She\u2019s Autistic. But I do agree it seems it severely underestimated that Autism and his ability to handle it long-term.", "As someone who has ASD, I 10000% believe your sister when she says she can\u2019t do something. And you should, too. It\u2019s not about wanting or even not wanting to do things. It\u2019s about having the Spoons, if you will. (Consider reading into the Spoon Theory to understand what I\u2019m saying.) Many people who have ASD apply it to their lives, as well. Some days we just don\u2019t have the spoons, so to speak. I can\u2019t tell you how many things I wanted to do but couldn\u2019t. And yes \u2014 it was absolutely because of my Autism. Whether it\u2019s doing my daily chores or going to my best friends college graduation. \n\nMany Autistic people don\u2019t wash their clothes. They don\u2019t wash their hair. They don\u2019t clean their house. They don\u2019t clean their car. They don\u2019t feed themselves. Etc. You have to understand that with some of these things it\u2019s really just a matter of it not being in their radar. For example, having a clean car just may not feel important to them and therefore it\u2019s not something they ever think about. Even if someone told them to clean their car.", "Bruh that\u2019s not how autism works. Neurodivergence sucks and it\u2019s very dependent on how your brain is day to day. \n\nIm not diagnosed with autism but I do have ADHD with a suspicion of being on the spectrum and some days I can absolutely do the dishes and others my brain says no, it\u2019s too overwhelmed and overstimulated for that brand of executive function. And no one *likes* being that way because you question why you\u2019re so broken or lazy you can\u2019t do a simple task like the dishes and your self worth plummets.", "ive tried to get her to therapy for a while, but she refuses to go", "OP's wife has refused help.  Yes, OP knew she was autistic before having a child together, but I don't think anyone can reasonably expect that a person will completely change after having a child; that they will refuse to participate in the care of that child or themself; that they'll refuse to contribute in any meaningful way to the family or relationship.  \n\n\nIt's interesting that you're worried about the wife getting psychosis but ignoring that the same thing can happen to OP doing what they are doing.  You excuse the wife's neglect bc they are autistic and have 'autistic burnout', but call OP an AH for suffering something similar.  \n\n\nAlso, let me point out that OP never agreed to be their wife's caregiver.  That was not a conversation they had.  OP agreed to be their wife's spouse.  These are not the same thing!  OP has been forced, without consent, into a caregiver relationship with their spouse, and their spouse refuses to get help.   \n\n\nIf a person has a child, refuses to care for that child, refuses to get the help they need to get to a point where they can care for themself or that child... what do you think is reasonable?  A life of servitude for OP?  The loss of the child to CPS when inevitably something terrible happens under the wife's watch?", "but she needs to put effort into everything so i suppose esh more so", "Can she go back to work,  and the child be in daycare? She is aimless. If not capable of working,  maybe volunteering so she keeps engaged.  Going down a social media spiral is unhealthy.", "So you're worried that in those 3 hours, your child hasn't eaten? This is gonna sound rude, but that's a relatively short amount of time buddy. \n\n Also, you're either severely underrating her Autism and how independently functioning your wife is, or underestimating how much the depression is affecting and changing her.\n\nYou consistently say you need to \"take care of her\" like you're a caregiver. What do you mean by that??", "Time for an ultimatum, she's a wreck and needs help.", "I do think he could handle it better, yes. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that he may also be suffering from burnout. But caregiver burnout and autistic burnout are two very different things. And postpartum depression, psychosis, etc, hell \u2014 these things don\u2019t even compare. That\u2019s how serious it is. Soooo many people fail to realize how scary postpartum can be and the things it can make someone do. Her \u201crefusal\u201d to do things is literally that. I highly doubt she WANTS to be parenting this way right now. So, yes. I am SUPER worried about all of this leading to psychosis for her. And yes, even him. People have been known to snap for less. I will say, refusing help is a big indicator a person is not in their right mind and DOES in fact need help. Unfortunately this is how many people end up in psych. I hope for both of their sakes it doesn\u2019t get that far. But how do you know OP didn\u2019t agree to be her caregiver? He never explicitly said they didn\u2019t have that conversation, just as he didn\u2019t say whether or not they talked about what being a parent would mean for her as an autist. I mean, marrying someone who is that type of neurodivergent or even disabled comes with that. These types of people are not always able to take care of themselves. Sometimes these marriages are not always 50/50. With that being said, when did I ever say this is REASONABLE???? Lmao. I literally spend my entire comment talking about how she needs help \u2014 and fast. I also didn\u2019t say he signed up for a life of servitude but I do think being with someone who is neurodivergent or even disabled is grossly, deeply misunderstood. If you are dating someone who has a condition of sorts and you plan to be in it for the long haul, the least you could do is educate yourself about said condition before getting into it, before you BOTH get hurt. Because YES!!!!! Caregiver burnout is just as real and valid. As I said before. But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t kinda shitty to suddenly switch up on your partner because something has changed and you can\u2019t deal anymore. And y\u2019all really aren\u2019t gonna like this one but it IS kinda shitty to leave your partner if they are disabled when you did in fact \u201csign up for this\u201d by choosing to be in a committed, long-term relationship with them."]}
