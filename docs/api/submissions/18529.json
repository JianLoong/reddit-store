Is there any help she can get for her behaviours? Sounds like she's borderline neglecting your child and that is massive concern.\n\nYou may need to close down her access to family money while you sort this behaviour out - but you absolutely do need to sort it. This is a dangerous situation for your child and precarious for you financially.\n\nI'm so sorry though mate. This is so tough and I hope you have a good support network.", "NTA. This is a difficult one, tbh, because it seems harsh to say you should leave your wife over her disability. But at the same time, if you phsyically/emotionally/financially cannot handle everything and ensure your child is safe and taken care of, then you need to put your child first. It may be possible that having a baby/toddler in the house is overstimulating for her, leading to the increased fixation on other things. Could working with a therapist help her to find ways to cope, if this is the case?", "It sounds like your wife is actively neglecting your child and doesn\u2019t have the capacity to parent, can you find an alternative childcare provider when you\u2019re at work?", "NTA but she needs help and therapy. Pregnancy and giving birth can lead to a lot of mental issues which could be causing this.", "INFO: Is she in therapy since the birth? Have you tried couples counseling?", "I would look in to adult Autisim services, and maybe consider having her go back to work sooner and put the child in daycare, or getting a caregiver for wife/nanny for child? \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven as husband and wife, it's important to have healthy boundaries, and she is breaking those.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo me, it sounds like you're doing a lot, while she seems to be pushing the boundaries of how much she can pass off to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe have a separate account for the bills?", "several of the closest people in my life are autistic and I have ADHD and so I can say your wife is just irresponsible. Disability to be sure makes life harder, but not impossible. Especially if you actively try better yourself and learn how to navigate and coexist with your neurodivergence. Doesn't seem like shes even aware that's something she should be doing", "She may have PPD. She needs professional mental help. \n\nIt sounds like maybe you need to make separate bank accounts.", "NTA  \n\n\nOP, you have to do something for the sake of your child, and for yourself.  You can't go on like this.  If your spouse refuses to get help, then you have to do whatever you have to do to protect your child.  \n\n\nI am neurodivergent.  I had PPD.  I know the weight of it, how hard it can be to get out of bed.  I was going to school time and a half, working full time and taking care of an infant that I struggled to bond with.  It's HEAVY.  But even under all that weight, I knew I had to feed and diaper and comfort the living, breathing human being I brought into this world.  That was the choice.  \n\n\nEither your wife is choosing to neglect your child, or she's so far gone that she probably needs inpatient care.  Either way, you can't continue to leave the baby with her.  Eventually something terrible will happen.  \n\n\nAre you able to meet with extended family to try and get more help?  Are they able to help convince her to get help?  \n\n\nI hope your wife is able to get the help they need.  I hope you are able to get the rest and help you need.

Way more info needed about her levels of functioning independently.\n\n I wanted to make a main comment to address what I've mentioned before. Those don't seem like the actions of a mentally well person. So you're getting her in the bath, changing her clothes, putting her to bed? It just doesn't make sense.....\nThe other option is she is severely depressed and stuck in PPD. She may need hospitalization if that's actually what's happening.", "NTA, but if she isn't already in therapy or counseling, this should be considered. Couple's counseling could help if you both think it could help. As an autistic person, I get your wife's want to buy things relating to her intrests, even when it negatively affects myself (not having enough money, not actually needing it, ect) and you should have a talk about it as well. I do feel bad for you OP, because this situation does suck, and your wife has to get help. Soft Y-T-A for how you said it.   \nhope this was worded right </3", "NTA..your wife is immature and maybe you underestimated her special needs sadly. I'd suggest you talk to your family Dr and ask his advice on how you can cope in this situation...it's exhausting being a parent but caring for an adult too must be hell. Take control of the finances and give her a budget to start with so you don't find yourself under more financial pressures.", "NTA \n\nI am autistic and know in myself the things I can and can't do. I talked extensively with my family and friends about having a child and they are all on board to help when I need it. When autistic it definitely takes a village to raise a child. \n\nIt sounds like your wife definitely needs help. Is there maybe a person you can bring in when they are not with family like a nanny or babysitter?", "Nta.\n\nShe needs help. If she won't get help, like I've seen in your comments, then you have to figure out if you even want to be with her.\n\nDoes she have family you can talk to? That she'd listen to? \n\nAs for the money, she's impulse buying. I don't know how your finances work, but bills need to be separated into another account.", "NTA\n\nClearly your wife is struggling to adjust to parenthood and desperately needs some help, because right now it sounds like she is neglecting your child. Her autism may be fuelling this behaviour, but she could also be suffering from post-natal depression and she urgently needs to seek advice from her doctor.\n\nMeanwhile, extra support needs to be put in place so you're not burning yourself out with worry. Can her family help out at all? Are there organisations available that can support you all?", "ESH. Get her help before she goes off the deep end. That is deep depression and having it right after a baby is indicative of a much larger problem. You've been watching this for almost 2 years and only cared the times that it embarrassed you? FFS  Unpack that with a therapist at your earliest convenience too.", "[deleted]", "NTA for wanting to straighten things up. Soft YTA for how you phrased it. Did you think about therapy or counseling? I'm not in a country where therapy is a catch-all, but it really seems your case is one that would benefit from it.", "NTA, but it sounds like she is suffering from post partum depression. She needs help. You may need to ultimatum her, but she has to get help sooner rather than later.", "Dude, it sounds like your wife has severe PPD. Stop assuming her behaviour is down to autism and get her help", "I\u2019m super curious if anybody commenting on this is Autistic themselves. I am Autistic, married, and also a parent. With that being said, YTA. And let me clarify why.\n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole for being upset she spent the rent money on Halloween costumes. That\u2019s super valid, and I want that to be heard. But it sounds like your wife is suffering from Autistic burnout. I highly suggest you consider reading up on this if you\u2019ve never heard of it. It could also be some postpartum stuff. Mixed together and who knows what could happen. Both are very, very serious and should not be taken lightly. It sounds like your wife needs help. Help that goes beyond you telling her to \u201cgrow up\u201d which is super shitty and actually not helpful to anyone \u2014 including you. Professional help is definitely something to consider. Especially if postpartum is on the table. I don\u2019t think a lot of people realize these things can lead to psychosis. When people, especially neurodivergent people, are suffering from burnout or postpartum you have to understand they cannot control about 98% of their actions. So even tho most of these things seem like a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to you, YOUR WIFE CLEARLY IS NOT IN HER RIGHT MIND. I put this in all caps to really put emphasis on the situation. \n\nI also want to point out that the way you speak about your wife and how she takes care of your child is off-putting to me. You clearly knew she was Autistic before having a child with her. If you were concerned about how she would parent then I hope this was something that was discussed before you decided to have children, or at least when she found out y\u2019all were expecting. If you yourself are not Autistic then you just really can\u2019t fathom how difficult life is on a day to day basis. Now add being a parent on top of that. Nobody teaches us how to be parents. Hell, they don\u2019t even teach us how to be people. \n\nKeeping that in mind, it also sounds like you may be suffering from caretaker burnout. Which is also super real and valid. Being a caretaker is never easy. I want to recognize and acknowledge that as someone who has been on both ends of it. But if you sign up for it you have to be prepared for it to get bad. And I mean really bad. \n\nI think you both should consider individual counseling and perhaps even couples counseling. Either way, I would absolutely make an appointment with her OBGYN or regular doctor immediately (preferably whichever one is a woman) and try and get her on track before she accidentally hurts herself, or even the baby if that\u2019s something you\u2019re truly concerned about. Please know that the healthcare system wants disabled people to fail. Like. It wants that. So you may need to be prepared to really fight to get her the help she needs. Be that long term or not. Especially being that she\u2019s a woman. Please, if you take away nothing else from my comment, let it be this. Men do not realize how much easier it is to get diagnosis or access to medicines, etc. \n\nAlso, Autism is genetic so PLEASE get any children you have together tested right away. The earlier they know, the better. The better for everyone. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ll be thinking of your wife. Wishing you all the luck.", "just a tiny yta", "I\u2019m torn\nOP you suck for how you phrased it but I understand so I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH\n\nHowever, you said she was fine before giving birth but has gotten much worse after. Is this really her autism or maybe possibly PPD? It takes a good year after birth for the hormones to get back to normal. So maybe she is struggling with that. Please don\u2019t assume it\u2019s the autism when it could be postpartum depression.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While my situation isn\u2019t quite as dire as yours sounds to be, I am finally coming out of a few really, really difficult months. There were times I felt on the precipice of a full breakdown without the words to explain it and just fully shut down. I wished someone would just see and DO something. Thankfully a med adjustment a few weeks ago seems to be working and Im doing much, much better. \n\nThe safety of your child and then the safety of your wife are your first and foremost obligations. Your wife\u2019s behaviors are neglectful, full stop. Though it may not be her fault if it is a PPD/PPA/PPP situation, it\u2019s still an unsafe environment for your child. Also, if you have any inkling she may want to intentionally harm herself or your child you need to take steps to medically and legally intervene. \n\nIf I were you, I would say a therapy appointment and full medical evaluation would be absolute non negotiables.

And you should, too. It\u2019s not about wanting or even not wanting to do things. It\u2019s about having the Spoons, if you will. (Consider reading into the Spoon Theory to understand what I\u2019m saying.) Many people who have ASD apply it to their lives, as well. Some days we just don\u2019t have the spoons, so to speak. I can\u2019t tell you how many things I wanted to do but couldn\u2019t. And yes \u2014 it was absolutely because of my Autism. Whether it\u2019s doing my daily chores or going to my best friends college graduation. \n\nMany Autistic people don\u2019t wash their clothes. They don\u2019t wash their hair. They don\u2019t clean their house. They don\u2019t clean their car. They don\u2019t feed themselves. Etc. You have to understand that with some of these things it\u2019s really just a matter of it not being in their radar. For example, having a clean car just may not feel important to them and therefore it\u2019s not something they ever think about. Even if someone told them to clean their car.", "Bruh that\u2019s not how autism works. Neurodivergence sucks and it\u2019s very dependent on how your brain is day to day. \n\nIm not diagnosed with autism but I do have ADHD with a suspicion of being on the spectrum and some days I can absolutely do the dishes and others my brain says no, it\u2019s too overwhelmed and overstimulated for that brand of executive function.

Yes, OP knew she was autistic before having a child together, but I don't think anyone can reasonably expect that a person will completely change after having a child; that they will refuse to participate in the care of that child or themself; that they'll refuse to contribute in any meaningful way to the family or relationship.  \n\n\nIt's interesting that you're worried about the wife getting psychosis but ignoring that the same thing can happen to OP doing what they are doing.  You excuse the wife's neglect bc they are autistic and have 'autistic burnout', but call OP an AH for suffering something similar.  \n\n\nAlso, let me point out that OP never agreed to be their wife's caregiver.  That was not a conversation they had.  OP agreed to be their wife's spouse.  These are not the same thing!  OP has been forced, without consent, into a caregiver relationship with their spouse, and their spouse refuses to get help.   \n\n\nIf a person has a child, refuses to care for that child, refuses to get the help they need to get to a point where they can care for themself or that child... what do you think is reasonable?  A life of servitude for OP?

This is gonna sound rude, but that's a relatively short amount of time buddy. \n\n Also, you're either severely underrating her Autism and how independently functioning your wife is, or underestimating how much the depression is affecting and changing her.\n\nYou consistently say you need to \"take care of her\" like you're a caregiver. What do you mean by that??\n\n*Edit! The irony that this comment gets downvoted while my main comment saying the EXACT same thing gets up voted shows how utterly ridiculous y'all are.*", "Time for an ultimatum, she's a wreck and needs help.", "I do think he could handle it better, yes. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that he may also be suffering from burnout. But caregiver burnout and autistic burnout are two very different things. And postpartum depression, psychosis, etc, hell \u2014 these things don\u2019t even compare. That\u2019s how serious it is. Soooo many people fail to realize how scary postpartum can be and the things it can make someone do. Her \u201crefusal\u201d to do things is literally that. I highly doubt she WANTS to be parenting this way right now. So, yes. I am SUPER worried about all of this leading to psychosis for her. And yes, even him. People have been known to snap for less. I will say, refusing help is a big indicator a person is not in their right mind and DOES in fact need help. Unfortunately this is how many people end up in psych. I hope for both of their sakes it doesn\u2019t get that far. But how do you know OP didn\u2019t agree to be her caregiver? He never explicitly said they didn\u2019t have that conversation, just as he didn\u2019t say whether or not they talked about what being a parent would mean for her as an autist. I mean, marrying someone who is that type of neurodivergent or even disabled comes with that. These types of people are not always able to take care of themselves. Sometimes these marriages are not always 50/50. With that being said, when did I ever say this is REASONABLE???? Lmao. I literally spend my entire comment talking about how she needs help \u2014 and fast. I also didn\u2019t say he signed up for a life of servitude but I do think being with someone who is neurodivergent or even disabled is grossly, deeply misunderstood. If you are dating someone who has a condition of sorts and you plan to be in it for the long haul, the least you could do is educate yourself about said condition before getting into it, before you BOTH get hurt. Because YES!!!!! Caregiver burnout is just as real and valid. As I said before. But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t kinda shitty to suddenly switch up on your partner because something has changed and you can\u2019t deal anymore. And y\u2019all really aren\u2019t gonna like this one but it IS kinda shitty to leave your partner if they are disabled when you did in fact \u201csign up for this\u201d by choosing to be in a committed, long-term relationship with them.", "NTA but telling her to grow up isn\u2019t constructive and won\u2019t get you to where you want to be. Get her evaluated for PP and look for a therapist for her. If she isn\u2019t willing to work on herself you need to take your baby and go.

You need to have a separate bank account where only you have access to that you can put funds that can't be touched in. Like rent/bills.

I read she refuses therapy, to me that is a red flag. She is alone with the baby for 3 hours a day... what if the baby cries and she gets overwhelmed and hurts the child in that time?

It's definitely worth looking up.

The actual problem needs to be addressed.", "It may have been 6-7 months before birth \n\n\nIt may be that they tried routines that didn't work, and they've had to start over and she's just tired from trying \n\n\nIt may be that she actually needs quiet she isn't getting during the \"break\" when other people care for the baby because she is still in the house, exposed to noise.\n\n\nHer support needs are not being met and that is causing her to display the signs of shut down / PPD / normal depression / withdrawal and apathy that are really alarming.\n\n\nPunishing her for not being the same level of \"functioning\" she used to be is cruel. She has gone through a physically draining, hormonally intense experience. She is aware she's failing and ashamed. She probably hates herself. Glad to see Reddit think she should, and that she should lose her relationship and child because nobody is able to communicate with her to get her stable.", "Clearly not a long enough one for HER. With *her autism* not yours, not mine, not any arbitrary ideas.\n\n\nShe's had LEAVE for 20 months. If she had terrible morning sickness early on, at least 6 or 7 months might even be before birth. And it's not actually a break if you're trapped in a house with a screaming dependent who can't even hold their own heads up. I'm an autistic ex nanny. It's not a break.\n\n\nYou can't get a break from sensory input if your kid screams. She is probably trying  to dull everything to avoid actually freaking the fuck out cos it's all too much, rather than simply wanting to nope out. This is a coping mechanism to avoid potentially being admitted to inpatient or removed as a danger to the kid. She is TRYING. She needs to try harder and accept outside help.\n\n\n\n\n\n She may have PPD which even neurotypical mothers can have completely trash their minds and bodies and relationships.", "Well yes autistic burnout will lead to and be comorbid with myriad other mental health issues. But the autistic burnout is what needs primary treatment.", "We don't know exactly how old the child is, just that they're still in a crib. For a young child, three hours IS still a significant period of time to not have access to food if they're hungry. Just because they were in the care of someone who *would* feed them prior to those three hours doesn't mean they ate just before and wouldn't be hungry.\n\nAnd if you cannot trust that your partner will feed your child, that's an issue. You don't need absolute proof that they're failing because even having it be a concern is bad enough. That concern needs to be addressed.\n\nAlso, he isn't basing it off of assumptions - he's basing it off of her behaviour, such as her lack of engagement with the child when he's around to see them together. WHY she may be failing at parenting matters a whole lot less than the valid concern that she isn't a competent caregiver for the child.\n\n>People are simply sheep and when they see a downvote they jump on the bandwagon.\n\nSure. But as this sub repeatedly demonstrates, people also just like to downvote assholes and asshole comments.", "Nope, don\u2019t think there are. As a high school and university teacher, this level of communication barrier would not be manageable.\n\nSome students have similar issues, but not around me.", "You may think you\u2019re like that, but your message is pretty clear and concise. You\u2019re obviously not non-functioning, since you have a job. \n\nIncredible depression leading someone to stay on tiktok and neglect themselves isn\u2019t autism - it\u2019s certainly not \u2018non functioning\u2019.", "Ha ha, well clearly each costume cost 20k a piece.", "Yup and i totally relate, I was procrastinating before an important appointment on Reddit this morning... and yeah I realised I was in danger of being late! But when everything seems too much and your supportive partner doesn't have the patience or energy either... yup. Outside help time.", "OP stated in another comment below that he has encouraged therapy but she refuses to go. That is on her. \n\nHaving Autism/PPD/Depression/etc... does not absolve someone of their responsibilities, especially to their child.\n\nFrankly the only options available right now are either she begins therapy and gets the help she needs immediately, or OP needs to make some tough choices on her access to funds and child, because they are not in a tenable situation.\n\nThat doesn't mean divorce and no contact, but it might mean distance until she gets herself together.", "When a child is involved, it doesn't matter. And yeah, that's really shitty to acknowledge. But if she's neglecting that baby, she shouldn't be around the baby until she can be safe with her child. Supervised visits can help with her not being alienated.\n\nNo one here is saying that she doesn't need help. She clearly does. But OP doesn't sound like he can mentally, physically, or financially provide that rn and that is okay. He needs to take care of himself and his child first and foremost before he can take up the challenge of helping his wife.\n\nAs a disabled person, it's up to us to help ourselves. She may not be there yet. But that doesn't mean she can push it off onto OP when he can't handle it. This situation sucks for everyone involved. She needs to take the initiative and say she needs help. Perhaps she should go inpatient for a bit. It's helped me when I needed to reset. I'm not autistic, I will never fully understand what autists go through. But I have spent several years trying to understand and working closely with the community. She can get herself help if she wants to. There are ways she can improve that don't rely on OP doing the work of an entire household by himself.", ">(shes been on leave for 20 months)\n\nThink it's safe to say that the kid is at least a year and a half old, if she needed extra time off before giving birth.\n\nIf she didn't, then this kid is almost 2. Not a newborn.", "And they wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019re a teacher, not a parent or a spouse. Not someone students and other teachers are expected to be able to let their guard down around. You can be yourself around a spouse, not a teacher.", "Wow. I can mask really well. Clearly I'm not depressed. Thanks for fixing everything in my life.\n\nBeing articulate and self aware has caused me nothing but grief because of people like you who think it means I'm somehow capable of caring for myself. I'm sitting surrounded by piles of trash and haven't showered in a week. Life is awesome bc of how aware I am. Just swell.", "Yeah and did you forget the bit where I said \"outside intervention or GTFO is ok\"? You're arguing with me because you think I've said one thing, and I think I said something else.\n\n\nI know *I* have a reputation for taking things literally & I have a lot of compassion for people struggling because... idk, I try and be generous and not a cynical beast who's happy for people to suffer because they find it morally justifiable. I'd like for even really sick people to get help even when they've given up on life, themselves, and their responsibilities - if it takes him leaving or her losing custody the kid for that to happen, *that's what needs to happen*. They HAVE to protect the baby.\n\n\nBut I just don't think this has to be an either / or situation. They could try protecting both, her needs didn't suddenly end because he has less time. He was willing to support her and that's... Gone. She's adjusting to more than just her experiences of giving birth/parenting. She's also lost a stable relationship because a new element has thrown it completely off and her safe person is so strung out he can't cope either & is snapping.\n\n\n\nOutside help, or GTFO.\n\n\nI thought that was pretty clear?", "Here's the thing: there are other adults around who are picking up her slack. The baby is not alone with her for very long, and I agree. \n\n\n\nSteps need to be taken. I keep repeating outside help or GTFO like people seem to think I'm advocating he stay at all costs...??\n\n\nI just think she shouldn't be thrown away like garbage for maybe having PPD and autism at the same time.", "Ah, in another thread of this I did literally say if him leaving is the thing that makes her get help, it needs to happen.\n\n\nBut please!? Tell me more about why she doesn't deserve sympathy? Why it's her fault? She literally cannot even feed herself, how is she meant to articulate stuff if she's getting non verbal? \n\n\nIf this kid has any chance of two parents being around, he needs to make sure she gets help and all these people telling him she's evil, lazy and has no excuses make that very unlikely to happen. He can get her into inpatient, or leave and make it a condition for her coming back. Again I refer you back to the \"outside help or GTFO\" Part.\n\n\n\nI'm hoping once the toddler years are over & she gets stable, she'll be legally allowed around the kid. Kicking her when she's down means she's more likely to unalive believing she's failed as a mother, partner and human being than the \"tough love\" outcome that leads to a happier resolution", "And since we don't know if she went on leave while pregnant, we don't know the child's actual age - like I said. \n\nThe important thing is that this is a young child. A kid young enough to still be in a crib does not yet have much ability to cope with being hungry. \n\nNot being a newborn doesn't matter here. If I thought the child was a newborn, I'd say she should *never* be alone with the child and needs to be forced into therapy before being allowed around the kid because not feeding a newborn for hours is straight up abuse.", "Well, you can\u2019t \u2018mask\u2019 that well, as clearly your reading comprehension is shit. \n\nI said \u2018functioning\u2019 not \u2018happy and not depressed\u2019.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "Exactly. The baby is only with her alone for three hours a day. She could take the initiative and have an actual break from the baby... During the day when there's someone watching the child. She could go out of the house, or just in another room while taking a much needed sensory break. Noise cancelling headphones do wonders. Even noise reducing earbuds (I use Loop) help me tremendously when I'm overstimulated. If OP happens to read this, I would recommend he look into getting some for her.\n\nGTFO and \"throwing her away like trash\" are different and yet it appears that you think they're the same? I could be misunderstanding your viewpoint, but leaving is removing himself from the responsibility of helping her. This is something that needs to be done, should he not be able to handle taking care of their child and her.", "I'm not sure where you're getting the idea I think she doesn't deserve sympathy or help. She does. And in my initial response, I specifically mentioned that she should consider going inpatient. But perhaps you didn't read my complete message before finding the need to respond.\n\nI'm not even advocating for complete access to the child to be removed. I think she should have access to the baby, it will be good for both of them (once she's able to handle it.) But supervised visitation to ensure the baby isn't being neglected.", "Furthermore, there are a TON of ways to communicate nonverbally. None of them are easy. But if you can't communicate verbally, you need to learn to communicate nonverbally. Sign language is an obvious choice. But an AAC device is also incredibly helpful. I've considered getting one for myself for moments I'm unable to communicate verbally. Alternatively, a cheaper option are PECs.\n\nOr most likely the easiest option to adjust to, is a pen and pad. They had journals to begin with, so it wouldn't be a stretch to extend that use to being how she can communicate nonverbally for the time being.", "Kids end up staying in cribs for far longer than they should. Just because the kid sleeps in a crib doesn't mean they're an infant. \n\nBut also, if OP is having to bathe and change and put his wife to bed, she's not as high functioning as he thinks she is.", "I was referring to my job as masking well. Have the day you deserve. His wife needs help. Maybe you do too.", "It feels very cruel to stop supporting someone who you know needed it before and definitely needs it now, all together, all at once, over something that is arguably not her fault. If she can't take the initiative to feed herself, then I don't think she's thinking clearly enough to logic her way into self care... burn out / shut down is extreme executive dysfunction. Our brains literally dysfunction to the point we can't do what we want, we can't \"just push through\".\n\n\n\nExplaining you are leaving to protect the baby and want her to get help and nothing else is snapping her out of it, but you're here to re establish a relationship when she's able to take part in one again is different to the tone people are taking here. You see that, right? \n\n\nHe could be involved in therapy, visit her at inpatient and bring the baby in so she builds up confidence & comes out able to return to the home. The way people are talking, it's \"no, she's not ok. This is not okay she's CHOOSING this\".\n\nI don't think she is.\n\n\nMy partner and I don't live together, we're probably both on the spectrum and after 10 years, I told him to leave. I'm the one with high support needs and physical disabilities so bad I poop myself in the bath and I'm 43. But I had enough cope left to proactively say, I can't keep this relationship going, I can't give you enough space. Move out and live on your own for a year, I will find ways to cope. I've gotten myself a social worker, she's helping me get a carer to come and help clean the bath, and make sure I'm able to get the meal replacement bars I use when I don't have energy to stand and cook.\n\n\nLike believe me. If he listens to these people, he'll be like \"no, there's no excuse\" and the baby will be raised by relatives while dad works. I just feel like there's a better way that leaves the possibility for making it with her having any mental health left.", "Ok, we are not going to resolve this. You're treating her like a hypothetical storyline, I'm thinking there's probably a suicidal woman out there whose partner is so frustrated he's going to listen to all the people telling him this is something that's her fault for not dealing with.", "We\u2019re getting the idea you think she doesn\u2019t deserve sympathy by your complete lack of sympathy in everything you\u2019ve typed. Especially where you keep saying \u201cit\u2019s been 20 months, she\u2019s unsafe\u201d when those reasons keep getting explained to you and you ignore them and say that they don\u2019t matter. Saying it doesn\u2019t matter is your lack of sympathy. Refusing to acknowledge the accommodations needed as actual accommodation and not just she\u2019s being a spoiled brat is a total lack of sympathy. So if you don\u2019t want people to think you\u2019re not sympathetic, maybe show some sympathy.", "OK WE ARE AT THE POINT WHERE SOMEONE WHO CANNOT RUSTLE UP THE EXECUTIVE FUNCTION TO EAT IS BEINT EXPECTED TO CREATIVELY FIND WAYS TO COMMUNICATE NON VERBALLY THAT SHES NOT COPING\n\n\nSHE IS COMMUNICATING THAT QUITE WELL\n\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT HER TO DO"]}
