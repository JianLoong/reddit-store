It was a very hard time for me, especially with 3 small kids. I met my bf 6 years ago....we'll call him...Mike. So after dating Mike for a short period of time, I gave him a key as it was easier for us as our schedules conflicted sometimes and he lived far away. That was never an invitation to move in, we never talked about that or anything like it. He came over one weekend and basically never left. Fast forward to now. My mom lives with me now, she helps me with the kids and I help her as she has RA really bad. Mike has never paid any bills. It was never discussed. He doesn't help with groceries and never offers to give me any money. He will sometimes if I ask because I'm behind on a bill or whatever. I asked him over a year ago to start giving me $300 a month. He youngest son turned 18 and he didn't have child support anymore. He agreed and I havent seen a cent. Spring break this year I decided to take my kids in vacation. I've never done anything with them alone before. We've never been on vacation without a lot of family. So I decided this year I was taking my kids on vacation, by myself. No Mike. In the past, I've paid for his vacation and his sons, without asking for any money or pay back. Mike is very upset. He says I'm being mean by not inviting him and his son on vacation with us. He says they are part of the family and should be able to go. He said he is willing to pay for his son and himself. I still said no. I want a vacation with just my kids and I.

This guy moved in on his own and hasn't paid you anything in 6 years but he suddenly has money to pay for him and his sons vacation and that's not a red flag for you. Kick him out of your house now.

Where I'm from, if he's living there and refuses to leave, he would have to be legally evicted or an unlawful detainer issued. If OP changes locks and he calls the police, they might allow him to break locks to get back into the home.", "Posted about lock change in another reply, however, best case scenario he leaves without putting up a fight, realistically speaking it sounds like he's been living there for a while now, so he can make an argument that he won't leave because he's got a right to be there, at this point you might  want to also explore legal options as to how to get him to leave the home (to have a backup if he refuses to leave). Calling the police when this is his current residence might not accomplish much but allowing him to realize that he can stay until OP issues some sort of unlawful detainer against him depending on where she lives. I agree he should not be living there, especially while she's on vacation, but just know what might happen and what your legal rights are and his, I've seen cases where law enforcement will allow people to break into the house because technically they still live there. So that's why I bring it up.", "So, Mike has a job.  He paid child support the last 6 years and does not anymore.  He does not pay rent or utilites.\n\nSo why do you keep him around?  Is his dick that magical?\n\nHe sounds like a complete drain on you and your family. Really think about why you are letting him live in your place.  Do your kids really consider him a dad?  Do you really consider him a partner, someone who you can count on in an emergency, who will help and pay bills/care for your family if something happened to you?\n\nDo you absolutely trust him to do right by you and your family?\n\nBecause it really sounds like he is mooching off you.\n\nI bet he has savings or a retirement fund that you know nothing about.  If you live in the US, have you ever seen his tax return?", "They are definitely more aware than you may realize.  I was in a very similar situation - single mom with 3 kids, freeloading ex who moved himself in.  One day after he had been complaining about the house being messy, one of my kids came to me asking if he even helped pay for anything in the house.  That was my first wake up call. It took me a little bit, but I got the strength to get out of that situation, and you can too.", "NTA \n\nThen again, is this a serious post? There\u2019s no way you\u2019ve actually fully financially supported this guy for the past 6 years, right? He doesn\u2019t pay bills? Groceries? Vacations for himself and his sons? You actually paid for all of that? Also, you said your mother helps with children, so I assume Mike doesn\u2019t help with the kids as well as paying for nothing. So is he your partner or a fully grown bum that you financially support? I\u2019m struggling to see any sort of positive to this relationship. \n\nPlease for the love of god get this man out of your house. Just get rid of him.

None of this makes any sense otherwise.", "NTA but why is he still there? Why did you allow him to stay in the first place? Not taking him on vacation is the least.

No one feels bad for you OP, only for your kids.", "First admit to the resentment you do feel for him not contributing a penny to his own support.   You are not obliged to take him on a vacation.

OUT.", "The only reading anyone would vote YTA is if you stayed with Mike even 1 more day.", "This guy must be really great in bed.\n\nWhat do you get out of this relationship?

My young son told me he was glad I left his dad. I hid everything from the kids, they still know. And I knew as a kid every time my parents fought. To be fair they didn\u2019t try to hide it but it affected more than you would think. I didn\u2019t know how to have a normal relationship until I accidentally got into one. Take care of you first, that means mentally too. Then the babies, remember they know more than we ever imagine. They are little sponges!!! Good luck!!!", "I'm sorry but my mom would have said the same when I was a child and she still thinks I did not know. I did, I knew for almost ten years that she was being used, it just didn't dawn on me till later that that's what I'd seen all my childhood.

He has been using you and taking advantage of you for years with no remorse.

Your kids are watching you and learning from this. He needs to go. \n\nBecause he lived with you for so long you may even have to officially evict him.

He will not have any money for a new place and cry that you are leaving him homeless.  But trust he has targeted and been working a new supply just in case, but just isn't ready to close the deal. \n\nIf you are renting, you can say the lease is up and you are moving the family to a new place and he is not welcome.   He will throw everything at the wall to get you to change your mind.  He will give you empty promises, love bomb you, try to guilt you and threats.  Some men will turn violent.\n\n   If you own the home. You need to be prepared to leave the home with your family and pets before serving him an eviction notice.  Take all important files, computers, old phones, pics and valuables out.  And generally it takes 10 business days to get them out, which means M-F, weekends and holidays do not count.  \n\n Then have your lawyers contact information ready to tell him all communication will be through the lawyer.  This way you wont have to deal with him directly and all the things he will say and do to change your mind.  \n\n It will get dirty and bad long before it gets better.  He is losing his sugar momma and those are hard to replace.  He preyed upon you when grieving, he has no morals or guilt about using other people.  There is no low, too low for him.   Which is something you are going to have to emotionally deal with and seek out therapy.  You are in a financial abusive relationship. \n\nYou can make things meanwhile uncomfortable for him, like having a financial advisor come over for planning out a monthly budget.  Which will be embarrassing for him to admit he contributes nothing.   And help hold him accountable for money for the bills.  \n\nYou can seek out couple therapy to deal with all the stress of being the one financially responsible and how much it makes you resent him.  \n\nSend him text to remind him daily that he owes you money per your agreement.  Send him an invoice via email.  Send him money request on Paypal or Cashapp with the note for Rent.  Harass him daily for money with text as proof that he isn't pay. \n\nDoes he have friends or family? Start asking them why he doesn't pay bills and wants to live off of a widow with kids?   Which will embarrass him and let everyone know what a real loser he is.  \n\nTake him grocery shopping with you and say \"your turn to pay.\"  Watch him squirm. Then if he says that he has no money then start taking items off and asking can you pay this much? \n\nIf he loved you, cared about your kids and their well being.
