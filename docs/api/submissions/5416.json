I left for college as soon as I turned 18 and had slight contact with my mother over the years, usually coming from me.\n\n So when she called me a few months ago to tell me she was getting married I was very happy for her, she asked me to be a part over the ceremony and be flower girl. I happily accepted because I would love to do that for her. I asked about my three little sister and if they would be in the ceremony too and my mother said they would walk behind my with flowers too, sounded great I was on board.\n\nNow about a month later I had everything I needed prepared, bought an expensive dress that would match for the wedding and hired a stylist to do my hair and make-up. then two days before the wedding My mother called me to inform me I wouldn't be in the wedding anymore due to my soon to be stepfather and sisters wishes, apparently they said I'm not really a part of their \"picture perfect family\" because I don't live in the house anymore. My mother agreed and gave me a seat to watch completely in the back. I was shocked and quite offended that they said that about me. My mother said it's not that big of a deal and I could just watch from a distance. I asked her why I had to sit in the back and that since I'm family I should sit at front, her reason was that people shouldn't see me there because it would disturb peoples opinions. \n\nThis just made me furious so I told her to enjoy her wedding and her \"picture perfect family\", but if people shouldn't see see then I might as well not be there, by that I ended the call and didn't speak to her again. \n\nmy soon to be stepdad called me calling me an A-hole for upsetting my mother like that and that I shouldn't do that to family, I kindly let him know he was the one saying I wasn't family so I didn't really care. \n\nMy other family members are calling me an A-hole too, So AITA?", "created_utc": 1671751595, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt0a4s/aita_for_not_going_to_my_mothers_wedding/", "score": 131, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
