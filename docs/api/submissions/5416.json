I happily accepted because I would love to do that for her. I asked about my three little sister and if they would be in the ceremony too and my mother said they would walk behind my with flowers too, sounded great I was on board.\n\nNow about a month later I had everything I needed prepared, bought an expensive dress that would match for the wedding and hired a stylist to do my hair and make-up. then two days before the wedding My mother called me to inform me I wouldn't be in the wedding anymore due to my soon to be stepfather and sisters wishes, apparently they said I'm not really a part of their \"picture perfect family\" because I don't live in the house anymore. My mother agreed and gave me a seat to watch completely in the back. I was shocked and quite offended that they said that about me. My mother said it's not that big of a deal and I could just watch from a distance. I asked her why I had to sit in the back and that since I'm family I should sit at front, her reason was that people shouldn't see me there because it would disturb peoples opinions. \n\nThis just made me furious so I told her to enjoy her wedding and her \"picture perfect family\", but if people shouldn't see see then I might as well not be there, by that I ended the call and didn't speak to her again. \n\nmy soon to be stepdad called me calling me an A-hole for upsetting my mother like that and that I shouldn't do that to family, I kindly let him know he was the one saying I wasn't family so I didn't really care. \n\nMy other family members are calling me an A-hole too, So AITA?", "created_utc": 1671751595, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt0a4s/aita_for_not_going_to_my_mothers_wedding/", "score": 653, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What's the difference between a flower girl and a bridesmaid? In my culture, flower girls are actually called bridesmaids, so I've always wondered \ud83e\udd14", "In some places if someone \"objects\" during the ceremony when they ask (even as a joke) the wedding has to be canceled and they have to rearrange everything. I say OP should go for it", "Flower girls are usually little girls who just throw flower petals. Not typically invited to all the pre-wedding events and often not in the same attire as the rest of the bridal party", "Because she AGREED with him???\n\nThat makes her just as bad in my book.", "Yeah he want her to be a outsider so his children can have a mom.", "Not if she's done it to keep the peace. If the guy demands something like this he's showing his control over her. There's potentially abuse here that's not been stated because even OP couldn't live there and left ASAP.\n\nIf OP could clarify what kind of person the guy is that would make it easier to judge.", "NTA. You are being reasonable. If you really want to get back at them I would blast this on social media.", "Nta", "NTA.  I would have done the same thing in your shoes.  You can thank your mother and her family letting you know where you stand with them and cut them from your life completely.  Let anyone who calls you know exactly what was said to you and if they still think you're an asshole cut them from your life was well.", "NTA", "NTA They all are the a-holes", "NTA. But you could go black dress and black mascara, just to  point out that \"*I'm not picture perfect*\", and I would't wanna be mistaken for someone who \"*matters*\".", "NTA. Anyone telling you what you did is wrong is a huge AH. I hope you can get your money back for the dress.", "NTA!  Clearly your stepdad and his family don\u2019t consider you family but your mom doesn\u2019t want to completely exclude you for appearances sake.  Unfortunately, your mom made her choice and she has to accept the consequences of that decision.  If people in your family are making you feel badly about this choice then tell them the entire story.  If they don\u2019t listen or don\u2019t care, block them.  Same with your mom and stepdad.  Might be time to go very low or no contact", "Haha no. I\u2019d be blowing their picture perfect image apart in a scathing, well tagged, public social media post. Then I\u2019d send them a bill covering everything you spent. The audacity of them! Your mother should be ashamed of herself. How vile.", "Honestly, I normally roll my eyes when I see a comment saying \"I'd cut all contact\", on AITA, but in this instance, OP's Mom's actions would be the death of our relationship if that was me in this situation.\n\n\nOP's Mom & Stepdad want the \"picture perfect family\" sans OP then let them away at it, but I'd be very clear to any family or family friends as to why I wasn't at the wedding, if I was asked, and they can forget about ever asking for a kidney/money etc.\n\n\nNTA, and I'm sorry your Mom is such a piece of sh*t.", "Go and object will hold the wedding up for a while", "Also who are these AH family who are calling the op to rant? If someone did this to my family member, I\u2019d refuse to go to the wedding in solidarity.", "Stepdad decided long ago, and now he's making sure that everybody knows that OP is nothing to him and his \"picture perfect family\".", "I agree we shouldn't; we can firmly blame her for her own actions of stepping aside while her child grew up in this household feeling lesser then allowing the treatment to continue for the 'perfect new family' she's cultivated in leaving her behind.", "oh for sure. i was merely trying to point out that it's a case of them pretending OP is family when it suits them.", "This is basically what all of this means:\n\nSoon to be stepdad: I dont see OP as our family\nOP's mom: I agree", "OP: I will not come then\nOPs mom: how dare you, people will talk you'll make me look bad", "Fuck keeping the peace. Keeping the peace is abuse in an ill fitting trenchcoat.\n\nAlso even if there was abuse in that direction, you don't get points for marrying your abuser.", "I agree. It's not right but if she's getting married to a guy who is nice to her otherwise.\n\nI'd personally just kick them all out of my life never mind the not attending a wedding.", "NTA OP.\n\nSounds like your mother, step father and sisters have all decided your not family.\n\nWould recommend going LC/NC with them.\n\nThese aren\u2019t your people by their actions and your best off not associating with them.", "NTA omg there fucking awful so sorry, make your own chosen family and move on with people who will love and appreciate you. Unfortunately blood doesn't always mean love.", "NTA at all. I\u2019d be petty and post publicly about the whole thing for all family to see.", "Obviously NTA, sounds like you need to block her and her new family. I'm sooooo sorry OP, best revenge idms to live your best life and fuck her!", "NTA might be time to go NC with your \"mother\" and her \"picture perfect family\".", "Your mom replaced you with her new kids. This just made it official.", "Wow. NTA. No contact immediately and block everything. F that.", "NTA. For the other family members that are calling you an ah make sure they know exactly what happened because your mom probably did not give them the full story.   Nc with mom", "Of course NTA and oh my, they're truly horrible. Don't go, they don't deserve you.", "It\u2019s all about you. You don\u2019t matter, your feelings don\u2019t matter and your presence doesn\u2019t matter. Treat yourself to a nice day out on the day of the wedding. Get a mani/pedi, a facial or have a nice lunch. They can all piss off as far as I\u2019m concerned.", "NTA. Screw your stepdad, your mom, your step-sisters and all the relatives who sided with them.", "Nta wooooooow, every adult except you sucks.", "NTA. \n\nBut hear me out. GO TO THE WEDDING. Go to the wedding and make sure everyone there knows who you are. And make sure everyone knows how they treated you, and what they said about you not being in their picture perfect family. \n\nShe wants you in the back because \"what would people think\" imagine the sweet taste of making that fear very real by loudly proclaiming what happened.", "Can we also mention the fact that they've been together 12 YEARS, so since OP was 11?!? This isn't some dude who never met OP until she was an adult (not that it would make it ok to sit her in the back in that case either). This AH has been in her life for more than half of it, and her AH mom has been allowing him to mistreat her for entirely too long.", "So what do bridesmaids do then? Are they usually adults?\n\nWe don't have a \"bridal party\" here. Nor pre-wedding events. Nor matching attires, usually.", "And to add: the mom has condoned this behavior for years to the point OP went LC.", "They are usually adults or teenagers. In the olden days they would have been responsible for getting the bride dressed and ready, and would have gone with her to her new household as an attendant. Nowadays it's mostly an honorary position, but they do help make sure the wedding runs smoothly and nothing distresses the bride or goes wrong", "Huh, ok,  thanks for the explanation!"]}
