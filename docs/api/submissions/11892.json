He's moved in with us by now. Well... I have not taken any change. I don't go near their room.

An apology from them would go a long way as opposed to them trying to put everything on your shoulders. \n\nIf your mother were really upset, then perhaps she should try to make amends as opposed to just laying on the guilt.

If you're one of the people who will be eaten up inside by holding on to this stuff, then it's probably beneficial to you to eventually let it go.

However, you are not TA for telling them how it impacted you. It's very shitty of your mom and her now-husband to seemingly refuse to validate your experience or apologize. They have some ability to help you moved past it, and they're either too ignorant or too prideful to extend that help to you.", "NTA\n\nA heartfelt apology from them is in order rather than a flippant comment and your mother is quite manipulative with her emotions it seems.", "You get over it when you want IF you want.

It\u2019s not like they got you a bad birthday present; they kicked you out of your home just before graduation and it sounds like your mom picked her boyfriend over you. I\u2019d have a pretty hard time moving past that. If you personally want to forgive them because it brings you peace, then do it; but forgiveness isn\u2019t granted just because time passes.", "NTA. Sorry you had to go through that. They neglected you, and mom's bf was probably jealous of you or something. Your mom deserves to live with the guilt", "NTA. Your mom had issues and projected them onto you as a kid, and then allowed her new man to treat you poorly and decided to give up being a mom in favor of a new life, that's happened so much more commonly, it doesn't get any less disgusting every time I hear a story like this. Your mom needs to grow tf up and either apologize or get off the pot. You're grown now and obviously have your own life, good for you.

While I do agree you need to work past the hurt feelings it\u2019s not something you just \u201cget over\u201d and saying that to you is just a way of them refusing to accept blame for their part in the situation.

Your mom taking his side regarding the theft and causing you to have to drive to school was a bridge too far IMO. You can love your mother but recognize she did some crappy things to you. You don\u2019t have to forgive her for those behaviors. \n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a bad mom but she did a lot of things to  me that really hampered my maturity and growth, which led to some awful behaviors on my part. She\u2019s gone now and I look at those memories with less vitriol and more understanding . I don\u2019t forgive her for some of the things she did.

Then she literally abandoned you when she joined forces with that asshole to kick you out. And they're not even sorry. I wouldn't even have wanted to let them back in.", "NTA. Your Mom manipulated you into staying for her then dumped you when she found a man.

To get forgiveness, you have to acknowledge, apologize, show remorse, and change your behavior. \n\nNow, getting over it doesn't have to come with forgiveness, but it doesn't have anything to do with making your mother and her husband comfortable either.  You have every right to speak the truth.  Getting over it is more about finding a way to allow yourself to heal, not allowing people to hide their bad actions and pretend along with them. This is how abuse is perpetuated generation after generation. We are taught from infancy that we mustn't make other people uncomfortable or hurt their feelings. And telling them your truth was brave, and hopefully a step closer to healing for you.\n\nWe adults always tell our kids that actions have consequences. Your pain and how you perceive them because of it is a consequence of their actions.  You have no obligation to hide that.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but you can reframe it for yourself as, some sap came along and married your difficult and flighty mother, and now you don't have to take care of her.   \n         \nI'm sorry you missed out on having the mother you wanted, but a lot of us do, and the bonus of the guy who doesn't care about you is that he keeps your mother out of your hair.", "This was a topic that you should have brought up in private with your mom.   Doing it openly like that put both of them in an awkward situation that would only make things worse.\n\nAH?  No, but you were wrong in how you spoke about it.", "I didn't... but for my nephew's sake at the time he was born it was just best to get along. My sister really pressured me into welcoming them back.  I don't regret it as the relationship has ''mended'' but there's still that little bit of resentment in my mind that won't go away. I guess that's why I brought it up 12 years later.", "I agree", "And your feelings are valid. \u201cYou gotta get over it\u201d is the classic phrase to make the victim of a conflict feel like they are the problem for \u201cholding a grudge\u201d. The offender wants the freedom of the conflict going away, but don\u2019t want to actually apologize.", "I understand. I'm in my 40s and I still resent my parents for all the crap they put me through when I was growing up. They never changed either, but at least now I don't live with them. They're like your stepfather because they get mad at me for bringing up the past but it's not entirely in the past since it had a long-term impact. I'm sorry you went through that. You didn't deserve it and I hope it gets better for you. You don't have to forgive them. They don't deserve it.", "Your step dad probably made up the theft to force you out.  Mom was totally self serving.  Wanted you to keep her company until she found a boyfriend.  Just keep that in mind when she and or he want something from you.  You owe them nothing.", "10 bucks says he made the change jar thing up to kick you out of the house at 18.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nYeah. Get over it. Nothing happened to them, so YOU have to get over it.\n\nNope.", "Was always what I thought too. And if I was actually smart(er) I could of exploited the fact that I had been 18 for over 6 months and in my state 6 months is legal residency and if you've been living there for that  amount (meaning your legal address is that same address) you cannot be kicked out. Unless you are contracted on a lease then the legal eviction process can happen. But boy that atmosphere....", "Wow. Thank you.", "I saw that you are looking at getting help for the trauma you suffered. That is a good place to start.  There is no getting over abuse.  You become a survivor.  That is what you need to do.  The other thing is set up boundaries with your abusers.  Forgiveness does not mean that you have to welcome them back into your life.  Your mom's husband is the issue.  You may want to keep contact with your mom on a limited basis but not her husband.  Meet in a public place, if he shows up leave.  He found a reason to kick you out of your own home and your mother's life.  He is the one that needs to get over the fact that there are consequences for your actions no matter how many years ago it happened.", "INFO - When you say you'd come home to a note, do you mean the same way a latchkey kid would, and you're just upset your mom wasn't available to you as soon as you were done at school, or would she actually miss dinner and/or be out overnight? I think your mom was entitled to some, \"me time,\" in your older teen years, and I can just about guarantee there's plenty you don't know about her marriage to your father that she probably kept from you to protect you. I don't think it's fair to expect your mom to have centered her entire existence around you.\nI also suspect there's more to this change jar story, especially since you say you weren't well-behaved and seem to blame that on your mother.", "op=NTA\n\nyou do not have to forgive.

He wanted you gone and your mom all to himself.  Chances are your mom caved to his pressure to keep this man happy.  But she has had sad regrets ever since.\n\nForgive your mother.  Her life has not been easy.  It may not be even now.  \n\nRecognize this man as a selfish manipulator, so weak that he forced a child out of her home and away from her mother.\n\nSee the two as humans with frailties that you must be aware of, but get rid of the anger.

Then told you to go when she had someone else she would rather make happy than be a good parent. She is very selfish and your feelings are more than valid.", "Absolutely NTA.

You don\u2019t need therapy for not forgiving them.", "You can forgive them for your sake, not for them.  Carrying around that kind of resentment and bitterness is bad for you.  As it has been said, it\u2019s like drinking poison and waiting for it to kill your enemy.  I think therapy is a good idea for everyone honestly but if it\u2019s impacting you regularly and affecting relationships in your life it\u2019s worthwhile.", "NTA. People always seem to conveniently demand forgiveness that they have done nothing to earn just so that their consciences may be soothed.", "Things will never be square with them until they acknowledge what they did and apologize. As you know already you can love them but still not forgive them. People who tell you you need to \u201cget over it\u201d are trying to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. Decide for yourself how much you are willing to be involved with them and find someone you\u2019re comfortable with to work through your feelings with."]}
