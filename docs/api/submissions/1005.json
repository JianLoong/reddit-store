I work with alot of people in a very communication heavy role. So lots of misgendering all the time. Many of my friends still misgender me because I can\u2019t be arsed to remind people all the time.\n\nGiven this context, if you were managing to semi gender me correctly that would be a big plus to me, even when you did get it wrong more than right. I can see that this person clearly isn\u2019t as comfortable as myself being misgendered but I am sure they appreciated the effort.\n\nBy excluding them all you did is silently tell them you didn\u2019t like them, and as they were already sensitive to how they were perceived I am very confident that that will have stung quite a lot.\n\nNext time engage with them and just correct yourself where possible. It does sound like you may be dyslexic to some degree as speech processing and inconsistency is a lesser known but reasonably common trait(I misplace words all the time).\n\nFinally, just a question out of curiosity, in what context do you find yourself saying \u201cgirlfriend\u201d so much?

Learn how to do better", "Yeah YTA for avoiding someone cos they're non-binary. If you are genuinely mistaking cis people's pronouns also then they'd notice that and that it wasn't anything personal if you gave them a chance.\n\nI strongly suspect you actually mean you muck you cis people's pronouns one time in a thousand and this person's pronouns eight times in ten. Do pronoun practice if you're having trouble.

Saying this is how I\u2019ve always been closes you off to growth and development as a person. Our views, experiences, language and so many other aspects should evolve as we get older.

Just use the damn name.", "NTA. Pronouns may be confusing and it takes time to remember who is using which. Stupid thing was avoiding them but I get it, you're afraid to say the wrong thing. I'd try different approach - when you meet new people and they introduce themselves with a pronouns you don't feel comfortable to use, let them know. Just say as it is \" I'm confused and might get it wrong. Please make sure to correct me when I'm wrong even if it happens 100 times per night. Please be patient with me\". It's better to get it wrong and be corrected every 2 minutes rather than avoiding them.", "YTA for not communicating your speech difficulties to them and just avoiding them instead.

You go around calling feminine presenting people He's for idk, a kick out of it??? And vice versa?? But you can't say Them out of respect. \n\nThat's the pronouns, but the \"girlfriend\" thing-- So I myself say \"girl\" all the time, and have accidentally said it to masc people, so I could see how that's potentially confusing for someone outwardly fem presenting. \n\nBut overall, If you happen mess up, just apologize and correct yourself then and there.", "If you mix up everyone's pronouns all the time then why did you consistently refer to them as \"she\" and \"girlfriend\"? Wouldn't it have been a 50-50 split with also referring to them as he/him? This all just reads like an excuse, OP. YTA", "I cna't seem to find the name of your condition but you are not alone. There are people suffering from it, psychologists too. So i think everyone here is quick to judge you on something like you are being lazy and you just don't care. You wouldn't shame a dislexic kid for having trouble reading. This is the same idea.\n\nTo me, NTA. You knew you would keep on offending them no matter what. So you took the route that would give you the least trouble. They might be extra sensitive on this issue as it is still an important issue for the lgbtq+ community and the fear of not being accepted for who you are often leads to defiance or agressivity. So they weren't the butthole. Real passive agressive though.\n\nThis was over one night where you had a few drinks and all. I suggest you sit down with them and explain your condition. That it really isn't against them, ypu wish to make them feel welcome but you have always struggled with certain part of the language and you may make mistakes, and even forget their name sometimes. They will even be able to notice you exchanging she and he sometimes so they will know it's nothing personal.\n\nThere are people that have no memory of people faces. They can't recognize them when they see them, even their friends or family. Is it that hard to believe that there are people that have the same problem with names and the language?", "NAH. \n\nI\u2019m willing to admit I think the whole pronouns thing is going overboard - but it doesn\u2019t hurt me to be courteous and make an effort for people who care about them, so when someone tells me I go by xyz, I\u2019ll make an effort to get their pronouns right because it matters to them, regardless of my feelings about it. Kind of like pineapple on pizza - I think it\u2019s nuts but people out there like it and need it, so they can eat their pineapple pizzas in front of me so long as they aren\u2019t putting pineapples on my pizzas we are good. I will tell them straight up I have a poor memory (which is true) and ask them to point out when I make an error to help me to remember and that if I muck it up it\u2019s not malicious, it\u2019s that my mind takes a little longer to process and remember information that Is new (again true thanks to multiple mental conditions, and needless to say is a conversation had about many different things, not just pronouns.). I will make an effort to learn their preferred pronouns out of respect for them. \n\nAs long as we both are on the same page of respect that I will correct myself if I catch myself making a slip up or that I won\u2019t be offended if they correct me a few times, and that they wont become hostile towards me while I\u2019m making the effort to learn or accuse me of trying to be offensive, we are all good. \n\nIf people start getting hostile towards me I\u2019ll back off. I know it will take me a while to get things right, and if they are offended by that even after explaining that there is a medical reason for it, there is literally nothing I can do about it. They don\u2019t want to be offended, I\u2019m not trying to offend, and I don\u2019t want someone getting upset at me accusing me of being an AH when , walking away is the next best option. \n\nThat said it didn\u2019t sound like you made much of an effort to explain that you are trying to learn and apologizing when mistakes happen. I don\u2019t think avoiding TO them was necessarily, but avoiding talking about them would definitely be one way to avoid misgendering. \n\nYour comment about getting cis gendered pronouns mixed up - the thing is most cis gendered people don\u2019t care about their pronouns- it\u2019s not something that hits their radar often because their gender has never been attacked. For someone with a different pronoun than they present, it\u2019s something very important to them and their identity, so it makes sense that when you get it wrong they will react poorly. In my experience so long as there is open communication and you are seen to be making an effort/apologizing when you make a mistake/not being hostile when corrected/ confirming phrases that you use interchangeably (eg \u201cI use dude a lot and interchangeably, if you aren\u2019t okay with that let me know and I will make an effort to remember and not use it, but if I slip up please know that it is no way intended to be offensive or to misgender you,\u201d) etc they\u2019re pretty understanding. \n\nA persons gender or identity isn\u2019t a factor in me being friends with them, it\u2019s who they are as a person. Are they nice, are they honest, are they kind, do they have empathy. If they don\u2019t tick those boxes I\u2019m not going going to be friends with them and I\u2019m going to limit my interactions with them BASED on those factors alone. A trans or NB person can be an asshole, but they aren\u2019t an asshole because they\u2019re trans or NB, they can just be an overall unpleasant individual no matter what they identify as.", "YTA for excluding them. imo that was worse than accidentally misgendering them. if you have a chance to speak to them privately again then i would suggest apologising, saying that you often have trouble remembering names and pronouns for Everyone and that you will try your best and that when/if you mess up you\u2019d appreciate that they (politely) remind you and you will get better. non binary people are everywhere as are people who are not as comfortable as your friends in being called the wrong name/misgendered so it\u2019s in your best interest to work on this issue", "I actually know someone with the same problem. He messes up his own son's name and pronouns (a 1 year old child, so not a child who has changed pronouns). To make it worse, he's the one who chose his son's name! He mixes up his pets' pronouns as well, so I'd be willing to guess he does it with everyone. Out of curiosity, do you have ADHD? Because this friend of mine does, so I'm just curious to know if it could be a potential trait of that, or just a random coincidence that you two have in common. \n\nI'm going with NTA, because your slips weren't intentional, however, like others are saying, a simple, \"Hey friend, I accept you as you are, I really do, I just struggle to keep things straight in my own head\" could have gone a long way to make them feel comfortable.

And our annual reports now need to be written with gender neutral pronouns. But unless I know you, you will be they/them until I\u2019m told otherwise?", "It\u2019s not that you kept getting it wrong, an honest conversation is needed here and yes \u2018damn girl\u2019 is gendered. But you then went on to exclude that person because of the boundary they asked you to respect. Even if you said to them, \u2018please correct me if I get it wrong\u2019 would have been better than to say \u2018well this is me and I\u2019m going to exclude you now because I can\u2019t get it right\u2019", "I agree. NTA. Sounds like you tried your best and then felt uncomfortable that they were getting annoyed. I can\u2019t believe how many people are so overly sensitive about the subject. They/them in reference to a single person isn\u2019t something we learned as kids and therefor doesn\u2019t come naturally when referring to someone.. add drinks to the mix and I could see how it was an issue.", "Singular \"they\" is also a valid option. The use of a singular they actually predates the use of \"you\" as a singular pronoun. \n\nYou probably use a singular \"they\" often without thinking of it. For example in the phrase \"Someone left their umbrella.\" nobody thinks that a group of people left a single umbrella. It's obviously one unknown person who left their umbrella behind.", "Yeah it\u2019s just how I talk. Like it slipped out not a concious decision", "Am I the crime ? Yes.", "\ud83e\udd2a", "I\u2019m not idek what that is man. And it just doesn\u2019t go in", "I\u2019m not really lol good AITA thing tho", "It\u2019s sounds more like this is the one person in OP\u2019s life who cares about being called by their pronouns and by name and instead of respecting and trying to do better they just rather not be bothered with being their friend.", "It\u2019s both man not worth the effort they\u2019re not even cool", "Prosopagnosia", "Yeah I don\u2019t get that from the post. It is exactly how I would describe it to someone face to face", "If you specify your pronouns, I can see why they/them is hurtful\u2026 but is it ok to use for people you don\u2019t know yet or at all?", "\"unless I know you or you've specified\" is a hugely necessary qualifier there, but also, IME \"I just they everyone\" seems to actually only get applied to trans women whether or not they're wearing a \"she/her\" shirt or something", "Tbh that person isn\u2019t entitled to my attention, and i was finding it too difficult and like I just want to remove myself from the interaction.", "I can appreciate that, but in a queer gender space as you can see it is a charged approach to speech that can upset people. Do you do it to the men you are friends with? I imagine not\n\nIts a approach to language that can be quite upsetting to alot of the queer community as it puts us in the Ru Paul Yassification club like we all run around shout \u201cQueen!!!\u201d At the top of our lungs when we see a cat or something.\n\nWhich don\u2019t get me wrong some of us do, but its not the norm", "I am sorry to hear that you think respecting someone is dependent on whether or not you think they\u2019re \u201ccool\u201d", "Read the comments. There is a serious lack of \u2018trying\u2019 or wanting to avoid awkward situations where the OP has been asked to respect a boundary.", "Oh for sure, its use for unknowns is perfectly logical\n\nSo yeah use away if you don\u2019t know yet or are unsure for some reason.\n\nMy example my friend has know everyone in our group for over twenty years, so he knows who are he\u2019s, she\u2019s and they\u2019s.", "I they every stranger because I\u2019m trying to teach my kid that you don\u2019t really know someone\u2019s gender just by looking, and it\u2019s such a habit now that I\u2019ve caught myself theying people I know, and know their gender, and having to consciously talk myself back into \u2018he\u2019 or \u2018she\u2019 because brains are weird. Or mine is, anyway.", "Well that\u2019s not right, it\u2019s a minefield and you don\u2019t ever want to disrespect someone. But I think with honest conversations with people you can get the pronoun right.", "Obviously, no one is entitled to anyone's attention, but your reasoning behind it is ridiculous. You struggled to respect someone's boundary so you avoid them??? Furthermore, you do know they're not going to be the only non-binary person you ever meet, right? What happens if one day you have a coworker that also goes by they/them? Are you also going to avoid them? Ignore your manager when they tell you to work with them?", "I\u2019m used to real obnoxious drag queens, I had one bestie. And I just vibed a lot with that. Because it\u2019s how I\u2019m like. I feel it\u2019s just more acceptable for drag queens to be like that\n\nAnd I\u2019m not really friends with actual men", "I forgive you", "Yeah, you can always just mention your pronouns when introducing yourself, and people then have an in to reciprocate, or just politely ask their pronouns just like  you could ask their name if you didn't know it!", "I\u2019d rather just step out of the situation wherever I can to avoid offence. Literally so I CAN respect their boundaries lmao", "Here may be the problem, when you speak one way and people are uncomfortable with it \u201cits just how I speak\u201d when you meet a bestie you like your speech becomes much more flexible.\n\nSounds like you may be choosing your method of communication based on what think sounds cool, rather than listening to those around you about what your impact you are having.\n\nWhich is fine but some people who are not comfortable being talked to in the way you choose aren\u2019t going to like you.\n\nI don\u2019t swear around my seniors because its inappropriate but I am common so around my equals I use swear words to express myself, except when working with someone one who is from quite a posh/proper background as I know that approach to speech can upset them. Its self regulation.", "Exactly, this is a massive learning curve for everyone including me, but the last thing I would want is for someone to feel that I don\u2019t respect their identity. So I\u2019m always happy to be corrected.", "I don\u2019t see how you\u2019re wrong. You knew you\u2019d keep misgendering them, so you left. What\u2019s the issue?", "I agree somewhat. You do need to try and get right but if you are really struggling with it and they don\u2019t want to understand that you are trying then maybe you do need to step out of the situation", "Just curious. You know you are in the wrong right? Pretending you are respecting them by avoiding them?", "Then is it ok to just not be friends with that gender neutral person so I can just talk like that without offending", "You can be friends with whoever you want.\n\nIf there reason you aren\u2019t friends with someone is because they are gender neutral/non-binary then yeah your gonna be the Arsehole in that situation.\n\nBut if your not friends cus you don\u2019t like em, then fuck em, don\u2019t need to be friends with people you don\u2019t like.\n\nIts like me not being friends with someone because they\u2019re a blonde\u2026 (I would be being an arsehole as its not the person but the characteristic I am being anti to)\n\nBut you can and should always try to be respectful, even to people you don\u2019t like."]}
