Fairies flitting around the office spreading personal business?  Actually, it sounds like your office doesn't have much gossiping, which is a good thing.", "Your coworker might be dry, she sure isn't sober.", "NTA.\n\nEveryone at your job is being ridiculous.  You can't be expected to know everyone's situation. \n\nAnd the fact is, part of recovery is learning to not be triggered by something like that.", "NTA\n\nIt is a scented bath product. There is zero alcohol involved here. The wine and champagne scents don\u2019t even smell like alcoholic beverages. They are just kind of sweet smelling.", "NTA, how could you know? For future reference though I would default away from alcohol themed stuff, you just never know. My last job did a secret Santa and the little cards had a space to pick \"alcoholic/non-alcoholic (gifts acceptable), and I thought that was a cool idea. I don't understand why she's crying, that's ridiculous. She's managed to get sober and that's not too much for her to cope with but an alcohol themed gift is too much? Give me a break. All you can do is say sorry and move on, it obviously wasn't malicious. Don't let them make you feel like shit, you didn't know.", "You didn\u2019t know, so all you can do is apologise and say you will change the gift for her, if she wants. \n\nNTA, purely because you didn\u2019t know.

I\u2019m 3 years sober, and if she really has been sober for a year and this upset her she probably hasn\u2019t been working the best program. To be fair my sponsor is pretty militant about you will never be able to run from alcohol so learn to deal with it. Even so, it wasn\u2019t like you shoved a glass in her face. Just apologize. Honestly my circle of friends would think her reaction makes her the asshole.\n\nThen again I know nothing about her life or anything she\u2019s gone through. I just know triggers are a tricky subject. Especially with old school AA\n\n\u201cBeing sober is my trigger\u201d -My Sponsor", "NTA apologize profusely for your ignorance and buy her a new gift.

Outside of that it really isn't your fault and people shouldn't be so mad over it.

Otherwise the ruling could easily swap to something like 'none here' or 'everyone here' depending on if there's more to the story or not.\n\nThis isn't an advice forum, this is a moral judgment forum. Rule #9.\n\nThat said, I'll go ahead and give my advice. lol. Offer to swap out the gift for something else. Apologize profusely.

You meant well and had no ill intentions. It certainly seems like your the a-hole to the office, however, sh*t sadly happens. The outcome always depends on how you handle it.

Unless she has said something to you, how would you know. In the future,  learn this lesson and stick to a different kind of gift. I had to deal with this a few times after my husband stopped drinking. The worst was a company dinner where they served Amaretto ice cream. He had a bite first and pushed it aside. I quietly spoke to the organizer to suggest being more careful in the future since he was unlikely to be the only one in this situation. Because I didn't start a scene, it never happened again.", "You didn\u2019t know. How are you an AH for that? You didn\u2019t deliberately buy her something like this out of spite. \n\nIt\u2019s so weird when people get upset over a genuinely thought out gift instead of realizing that it\u2019s actual the thought that counts. You could have bought her a crappy dollar store gift and put no thought into it at all. Is that what people would rather these days so they don\u2019t have anything to get offended about?\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t know and no one had told you?

It\u2019s not your responsibility to research your coworkers personal life so you can avoid every potential emotional trigger a person has.", "NTA - Keep an eye out for future problems. I could be wrong, but it sounds like you may have found \"the one\" in the office that causes drama and may be in the HR office frequently. When you apologize, keep it very brief so your words don't get twisted. This will blow over in a few days when some new drama comes up.", "NTA. You didn't know she was a recovering alcoholic and everyone is blowing this whole situation out of proportion. Just explain that your didn't know, apologize, and get her something else non-alcoholic. Even if it is a gift card to some other store. If she doesn't accept your apology, then you know she is not a reasonable person and stay clear from her. And if your other coworkers never let you hear the end of it, then get out of that toxic work environment.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t know you were sober and you gave her bath products with a champagne theme.\n\nI would let her and everyone that is giving you a hard that your intent was a good one, you wanted to get her something for her birthday, it could have easily been vanilla scented. You would never knowingly give her something you knew would be a trigger. \n\nHopefully she and you can move past this\u2026.", "I understand her initial reaction, she can't help how she feels, but the office getting mad over someone who couldn't know about her sobriety gifting something that wasn't even actual freaking alcohol?  Everyone needs to calm the fuck down.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Champagne Toast at Bath and Body Works is so ubiquitous as to dilute the meaning of it's name.  Half of the time, I picture actual toast before I correct myself. Apologize sincerely and move on. No one can expect more of you.", "NTA, sounds like an honest mistake and B&BW has a great exchange policy if she didn\u2019t want that scent.", "NTA. You didn't know. You just picked a theme you thought was pretty,and from what I understood,you didn't actually give her any alcohol. Sounds like you gave her Bath and body works lotion or whatever. Just because she is sober doesn't mean she can't use some smell good lotion that is just champagne theme. That's kind of ridiculous, actually. I think it was nice of you to get her something. Your office needs to get over themselves. It's the thought that counts. If your gift was enough to trigger her,that's her problem. You were just trying to get her a present.", "I\u2019m pretty new to my sobriety (58 days!) and it\u2019s tough. I love drinking (not past tense. I still do, I\u2019m choosing not to anymore).

Just apologize profusely then let it drop. Some other drama will replace it before you know it.", "Your NTA... But your going to look like one.", "Info: what grounds would make you the AH in the situation? You had no idea what her situation was. \n\nWTF is she crying for lol.", "A) she has almost certainly had to overcome more difficult struggles to maintain sobriety. What you did wasn\u2019t great, but you don\u2019t need to beat yourself up over it.\n\nB) in the future, you should really only get alcohol related things for people whose alcohol preferences you know. While not the same thing, it would also have been a bummer if you got somebody who doesn\u2019t drink any whiskey a bottle of scotch. Ask yourself \u201cwhat do I _know_ this person likes\u201d when you get them a gift.\n\nC) apologize to her, and get her something appropriate (appropriate! Not sobriety OR alcohol themed. You may have to ask others to help here.) does she have pets? Does she like coffee? Does she hang pictures at her desk?

Offer to exchange the gift if she'd like.", "NTA.\n\nNot necessarily you would have known ahead of time because many recovering alcoholics do not publicize that aspect of themselves.    \nEven though you didn't necessarily intend to do anything wrong, apologizing would be a great gesture.

You\u2019re not an active AH but a bit of an AH for not thinking about it.", "I'd say alcohol themed items aren't a work appropriate or inappropriate gift, it's in a gray area. Yours was an understandable misstep and she had an understandable overreaction.

There is no permanent damage done to your standing in the office with a misstep like this unless you double down.\n\nEdit to add: things to avoid when gifting in work settings are common allergens (peanuts, lilies, etc.), anything religious, anything political, and anything alcohol (or drug) related.\n\nEdit to clarify the rule of thumb around alcohol applies to alcohol THEMED items.", "YTA but just out of bad luck.

It, unfortunately, had a little chocolate bunny in it that read \"Easter Bunny,\" and this guy tried to get her fired and went to the CEO and also the Founders, who she directly reported.

Tell her you are very sorry for not knowing and triggering her, for your own sake/image at work, but know that I (and it seems many other people) think it is bullshit for her to be this upset when you didn't even give her alcohol and you didn't know she was sober.
