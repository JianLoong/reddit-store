Kieran and his GF were there too. I\u2019ve always got on well with all of them and they know my situation and have generally been supportive.\n\nIt came out (accidentally, which stung a bit) that there is a vacancy at their company, similar to my previous job.  \n\nI asked about it and Dave couldn\u2019t help, hadn\u2019t known about it, didn\u2019t know the people involved or what the job was.  \n\nKieran did know and could have helped but was non-committal and vague but I kept asking and he provided more details. I thought I could definitely do it and was really enthusiastic.\n\nI asked him if I could apply and he wasn\u2019t keen at all and said he didn\u2019t think it was a good fit and  not my thing.  He knows anything would be at the moment!  \n\nI said it sounded perfect and I wanted to apply and asked him to put a good word in for me. He still didn\u2019t sound happy about it and kept making lame excuses. \n\nHe said it was a different department, he wasn\u2019t the hiring manager and couldn\u2019t influence it, I was free to apply but he couldn\u2019t really recommend me. I asked why not as he\u2019d recommended Dave for a job in a different department. Then his mum got involved, backing me up, saying family  was important and I was a great worker. \n\nHe argued for a bit with us, then said he\u2019d not had concerns about Dave, he did about me! After everything that\u2019s happened, and thinking he was on my side, wow! I got annoyed and probably shouted a bit and asked him what he meant.\n\nHe said I had a work ethic and attitude problem and I didn\u2019t get fired for nothing and he wasn\u2019t prepared to harm his own career recommending someone who he had concerns about!  He said family loyalty also meant me not harming him at work! I couldn't believe it and said so. His mum agreed with me and there was a big row, us v Kieran.\n\nThen Dave also got involved and asked his mum to back off and me to leave it which was even more hurtful.\n\nWe left soon after and Dave is now annoyed with me for \u2018causing\u2019 the fight.

Here\u2019s why\u2026\n\n1- you got fired due to a \u201cmisjudgment\u201d and you say the company overreacted.

Why do you think getting louder and arguing is going to somehow get someone on your side? All you did is prove the brother\u2019s point! \n\n4) Lastly, you bring it up AGAIN, this time with BF, probably complaining about his brother (who you railroaded) instead of accepting that maybe you have some growing up to do. \n\nSorry OP, your own story makes me think you\u2019d be a risk to take on.", "YTA He was being polite and since you pursued the issue on why he wouldn't put in a good word for you, you found out why and didn't like the answer. He did  suggest you can  apply without his interference.

It just shows poor judgment and bad time management.  If you were in the US, I think you'd get more slack.  But you're in the UK so you get at least 28 paid days of holiday per year.  So you absolutely breached your employers' trust.  Not to mention the absolute stupidity of putting the proof on social media.  \n\nI absolutely wouldn't jeapordize my good reputation at a company to vouch for you.", "YTA, you can't ask someone to vouch for you when your work ethic isn't great.

Let\u2019s be honest, the reason you got fired isn\u2019t super heinous, but it\u2019s really dumb and professionally embarrassing. It also doesn\u2019t sound like a first-offense firing action, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was used as an excuse to fire you. Knowing this, and the way you acted when they didn\u2019t immediately say \u201cyeah, I\u2019ll make sure you get this other job,\u201d I probably wouldn\u2019t want to make myself look bad by suggesting you for a position where I work, either.", "YTA for pressing the issue after he said no.

First, no is a complete sentence, and whining \"family\" does not entitle you to anything.  You are not owed anything by your BIL. Secondly,  you committed fraud. I'd turn you  down, too. Why should your BIL risk their reputation and possible job growth due to you? Also,  you take no responsibility for the loss of your job.  The company didn't overreact.

You've not provided any details of your 'misjudgement' that got your fired. Clearly your bf's brother feels your either your company didn't overreact or your misjudgement was pretty serious.

You aren't the kind of person that people are willing to vouch for and time to do some inner work and turn that around. \n\n Here you have two jobs, two different opportunities to prove that you are a great worker and reliable and all you can do is complain about them.  No one wants to be around, especially at work with that type of attitude.  \n\n Time to work hard and pay your dues but you are busy trying to get out of the consequences of your bad actions and expect everyone else to hel p you do it.", "YTA. You choose to call in sick and then go on vacation instead per your post history. I remember how you felt it wasn\u2019t your fault then. Why on earth should Kieran stick his neck out for you? You broke the trust of the employer per your post history, he doesn\u2019t want that to happen again. He\u2019s fully within his rights to outright refuse.

It sucks that you have to work 2 jobs, but use this time to build your work reputation back up. Find a job you can apply for, and get it based of your merits. Also, it sounds like you blame others for your mistakes, i.e. friends won\u2019t back you, got fired for something your company overreacted to. Until you take responsibility, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get the support you want.", "YTA.  You should have read the room.  He was trying to tactfully say no, and you pushed it, and he was honest.  Why would he want to recommend someone who basically took  paid sick leave to go on holiday and had the audacity to say they had flu/chest infection.   You got fired because of your actions (you did say they took other unrelated actions /concerns into account, so it wasn't a one-time misjudgement) and lies. Why would he recommend someone with that reputation?\nApply for the job in the normal manner, but stop expecting favours you're not entitled to.", "YTA. Sorry I wouldn't recommend you either. You think your last company overreacted on firing you so you haven't taken any responsibility for your actions. How's that make you look? Bad. Get another job on your own merit. No one has a responsibility to recommend you.", "Yta. Sorry but there are very very few people I would put my neck on the linr to recommend for a job. I don't know the story of why you were fired, I'm guessing Keiran does have more insight and that makes him not comfortable putting in a recommendation for you to get the job and that is perfectly fair. His reputation in the company is on the line. \n\nNow if he actually tries to prevent you getting the job, that is anothwr thing entirely and he would be an ah also. It's ok to not recommend you and simply stay out of the hiring process entirely, it's another if he tells them his opinion of you.", "YTA\n\nNo is a complete sentence. You do sound like you have an attitude problem and don't handle being told \"no\" very well.\n\nHe tried many times to politely say he wasn't going to recommend you. You pushed and pushed. This says far more about your character than his.", "Yes, YTA. Based on your post history of what happened at your last job (calling in sick 5 days in a row because you\u2019d used all your PTO and wanted to take another vacation), I would NOT risk my reputation by recommending you for a job. Why in the world would he? He said you were free to apply on your own, and pushing back at all, much less the amount you did, getting his mom involved, etc. is well, well into AH territory. But it fits with your two posts about your former job where you continually make the excuse \u2018loads of ppl call in sick with the flu when they aren\u2019t because they didn\u2019t have any vacation time left\u2019 and totally refusing to accept any kind of responsibility for your actions. You need a reality check. There\u2019s a reason your bf\u2019s brother didn\u2019t intentionally bring the job up to/around you.", "YTA. I had my mind made up before I learned why you were fired and that really cemented it. You were fired for good reason and your boyfriend's brother shouldn't have to put his name on the line for your very bad judgement. You were an asshole for pushing for that and an asshole for not telling their mother why you were fired in the first place. Find a new job on your own merit while learning from the jobs you have now. Maybe you'll learn why your previous employer fired you for good reason", "YTA\n\nThere is a lot of entitlement from OP here. Even if you were married to your BF, his brother is allowed to use his judgement and not recommend you where he works. Kudos to OP for admitting that there is a \"there there\" and she is trying to move past it. But your pseudo-BIL is not required to overlook whatever happened. He might have done a recommendation if he had seen a change in OP since losing the professional job. But it's only been a few weeks.\n\nI also get the impression that OP doesn't live with her BF. Thus they are not financial partners and I wonder how long the relationship has been going on. Instead of looking to pseudo-BIL for help look to BF. \n\nAlso, BF Dave isn't putting OP in for a recommendation. I'd focus on that lack of support over the brother. \n\nHope everything eventually works out for you OP.", "Ok here I go tryna to dissect this. Keiran maybe not keen to put in a good word based on your past job I know you need to get back on your feet (probably the causing of you coming on a bit aggressive) but pushing him like that might not be the best approach and to bring up at the dinner. YTA but not the worst \nA-hole.", "You're allowed to ask, Kieran is allowed to say no. You haven't given us any details on why your previous employer terminated you, but I assume that Kieran knows about it.  You're asking Kieran not just for a recommendation, but to potentially put his reputation on the line. I don't blame him. You can still apply, but I wouldn't mention Kieran or Dave going forward.\n\nEDIT: after learning why OP got fired, I'm changing my vote to YTA.

You're an immature brat, and I wouldn't hire you or want you to work for the same company either.", "After learning why you got fired, yeah, you deserve it.

You\u2019re a bigger ah for blaming your previous company for overreacting when they fired you instead of acknowledging you deserved it.", "YTA.\n\nYou've said that you lost your job due to a \"misjudgement\" on your part. You consider that the company overreacted.  From your post history, it seems you falsely used sick leave to take a holiday which would essentially be gross misconduct/fraud.  \n\nIt is a lot to ask someone to recommend you for a job when they left their last job under a bit of cloud, let alone when they left under those circumstances. \n\nIf someone has worked with you, worked at the same company and know what the management and company practices are like, had a front row seat for what happen and believed you were unfairly sacked - yes, then they know what you are like and can recommend based on that knowledge without concern of risking their own reputation.  \n\nBut you were asking a personal acquaintance to recommend you in a work setting, when any subsequent issues could reflect badly on them, and when they know you have acted improperly in your previous job in that field .\n\nWhen Kieran refused your request for a recommendation, you should have accepted it and done what he suggested and tried applying through the normal channels.\n\nAnd frankly, given what your post history indicates about what happened in your previous job and given Kieran's concerns and clear attempt to dissuade you from applying, I think you should thank your stars he's saying to you apply but I won't recommend you, because Kieran could easily have been having a quiet word with the hiring manage to advise against you.", "It\u2019s been 12 days and you\u2019re already tapping into your savings?

He is right- this could come back to bite him- very hard. NAH, but if you keep pressing the issue Y T A.", "I understand your situation, but I think you shouldn't have asked for him to recommend you. As illustrated by your post, where you affirm you where let go by something you did (though you claimed the company overreacted, which can be perceived as not taking responsibility) and then lashing out at you BIL after he refused to recommend you, you should see how someone can see you as a loose Cannon. When you recommend someone you are (kind of) responsible for that person, if she misbehaves it reflects poorly on you. It's perfectly understandable that your BIL isn't willing to take that risk for you as you are only is brother gf. \nI understand it may be rough for you right now, but you have two jobs. The fact that you are not earning the amount of money that you would like and that you share the jobs seem to tell more about you than you realize. It seems to indicate you're somewhat spoiled, as you seem used to an expesive lifestyle, and that you like a more relaxed, less physical job. nothing wrong with want a better paid and less physical job, but physical and poorly paid jobs aren't below you. Your just a girl. Suck it up till you can get a better job, and try keeping a lower profile and you might find it easier to return to where you want to be.\nSo, overall, while I empathize with you, YTA", "I don\u2019t think YTA.

I\u2019ve always got on well with all of them and they know my situation and have generally been supportive.\n\nIt came out (accidentally, which stung a bit) that there is a vacancy at their company, similar to my previous job.  \n\nI asked about it and Dave couldn\u2019t help, hadn\u2019t known about it, didn\u2019t know the people involved or what the job was.  \n\nKieran did know and could have helped but was non-committal and vague but I kept asking and he provided more details. I thought I could definitely do it and was really enthusiastic.\n\nI asked him if I could apply and he wasn\u2019t keen at all and said he didn\u2019t think it was a good fit and  not my thing.  He knows anything would be at the moment!  \n\nI said it sounded perfect and I wanted to apply and asked him to put a good word in for me. He still didn\u2019t sound happy about it and kept making lame excuses. \n\nHe said it was a different department, he wasn\u2019t the hiring manager and couldn\u2019t influence it, I was free to apply but he couldn\u2019t really recommend me. I asked why not as he\u2019d recommended Dave for a job in a different department. Then his mum got involved, backing me up, saying family  was important and I was a great worker. \n\nHe argued for a bit with us, then said he\u2019d not had concerns about Dave, he did about me! After everything that\u2019s happened, and thinking he was on my side, wow! I got annoyed and probably shouted a bit and asked him what he meant.\n\nHe said I had a work ethic and attitude problem and I didn\u2019t get fired for nothing and he wasn\u2019t prepared to harm his own career recommending someone who he had concerns about!  He said family loyalty also meant me not harming him at work! I couldn't believe it and said so. His mum agreed with me and there was a big row, us v Kieran.\n\nThen Dave also got involved and asked his mum to back off and me to leave it which was even more hurtful.\n\nWe left soon after and Dave is now annoyed with me for \u2018causing\u2019 the fight. All I\u2019m trying to do is get back on my feet and be given another chance and I feel so unsupported. We had another fight and he blames me for that.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why would he vouch for you and possibly put his own position in jeopardy when he has legitimate concerns about your work ethic? Having learned about the job now you can certainly apply, but you should have graciously backed off when he shut you down.

Read your other posts and you were fired for something is actually a big deal. And from your various comments, you still seem to think that what you did was not really a problem. So I would have trouble recommending you for a job because if you did some asshole move like that, it would make me look bad.  That does not mean BF\u2019s brother doesn\u2019t like you or wish you well, just that he sees too much risk in you coming to work on his referral. His parents probably do not fully understand that risk and so you created a family fight by asking for him to do something that could hurt his career. It\u2019s fine to have asked once, but you should have read the room and realized it was not going to happen rather than persisting. Then you could have talked to him offline, gotten his explanation, and maybe learned a lesson that there are serious consequences for committing fraud in life.

I didn\u2019t know people feel so strongly about this. It was definitely a bad judgment call by op but are people really not taking random sick leaves when they\u2019re not actually sick. For example my company gives around 22 days of vacation leaves and allows around the same number of personal+family sick leaves. You\u2019re supposed to produce a certificate only when you take more than 3 days off continuously. A lot of my co workers make it a point to use all their sick leaves although not as brash as op of course. Also, gotta commend op on using up all her vacation leaves considering how difficult it is to even get them approved sometimes. I wrote this comment only coz I wanted to find out that if using your sick leaves when you\u2019re not actually sick really that big of a deal?", "YTA,", "YTA.

A few points need to be noted here for non-UK people that make this much much worse:\n\n1. Including bank holidays you have more than 30 days off per year. You worked there for almost 2 years so you would have both known the company culture and had the full annual leave at the start of the year.\n\n2. You were in a union. It's almost impossible for union members to be fired unless the company is conducting mass layoffs. Normally it's disciplinary measures first such as suspension, loss of overtime, etc.\n\nThey did not overeact. You admit through comments and posts that there was some past behaviour that was raised by the company. \n\nYou lied about being sick for 5 days. Given that sick leave is fully paid or partly paid (depends on a few factors) you essentially tried to defraud the company at the same time. Your coworkers would have had to pick up the slack and also this was just before Christmas so this makes you even more TA.\n\nPenultimately, and I could go on for hours, you are upset that someone wouldn't jeopardise their career so that someone who is clearly unreliable could coast away in a nice new job, where you would, let's be honest , conduct yourself in the same manner again because you know that your boyfriend's big brother can bail you out.\n\nFinally, you are unreliable as a narrator, I looked at your past posts and comments, you claim to have been fired 7 DAYS AGO and in that time have found, applied and interviewed and worked 2 minimum wage jobs. Then you claim to have dwindling savings because of this when you were so recently FIRED from your job that your final paycheck probably hasnt entered into your bank account. The reason you have dwindling savings is because you went on a holiday.\n\nAdmit the truth, at least to yourself, THEY WERE RIGHT TO FIRE YOU.

The minimum wage jobs I worked had five weeks plus of holiday time, plus sick leave. I currently have 9 weeks holiday, having worked in my job for 5 months. Two weeks is totally nuts to me.\n\nI see stories about people giving birth and going back to work two weeks later in the US. That would honestly never happen here except by choice - the government actually mandates that you must take a minimum of either two or four weeks off depending on your job, and statutory maternity leave I believe is 52 weeks (paid).

I wouldn't stick my neck out for you either.", "That's really not the reason you're getting hate. Your preoccupation with that part, the only part of the situation you weren't responsible for, rather than the many, many other aspects of this that you are entirely responsible for, really just shows how little you've learned, and how right your BFs brother is for not reccomending you. Your judgement is awful.", "Oh I'm well aware that the US sucks with a lot of things, I'm just pointing out that she has had more than enough time for her holiday and was taking serious advantage when others have to make due with less.", "THIS! This is it. \n\nOP, the fact is you made a mistake. It wasn't a massive mistake but it was a mistake. When you make a mistake, the correct thing to do is own it, apologize, and make plans to be better. \n\nIf you approached your BF's brother and said, with humility, that you realized you made a serious error, really took the situation seriously, and that you understand how important it is to rethink your behavior - he might have helped you. His reputation is at stake here. \n\nBut to behave as though it's not a big deal, to refuse to take full responsibility and act with humility, and then to argue with him as though you are entitled to his help - that's NEVER going to go over well. \n\nSo what to do? First, talk to your boyfriend's brother. Apologize for putting him on the spot. Tell him that you've been minimizing the situation because you have been so embarrassed by it, but that you understand how much you messed up and you deeply regret it. Tell him you are sorry for pressuring him and that you won't ask for his help anymore, but you hope that he will give you a chance to try to improve his opinion of you. Then let it go. That will do more to improve your chances at getting any kind of help than anything.", "Oh for sure, and I find it astonishing that she still doesn't consider it a big deal.

Read the room, and act accordingly.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s sad that it happened to you but you made huge mistake and now you have to live with the concequences for a bit. \n\nYou cannot ask him to put his reputation into play when you did something that showed him that you\u2019re immature.

Your actions speak louder than words in this case, and even though you ARE remorseful, you still messed up and these are the consequences.\n\nLook at this from Kieran\u2019s perspective. His career is valuable to him, and if his employer found out what you did at your last job, it COULD potentially harm his relationship with his company, since they might question is loyalty and abilities after recommending someone with a bad record.\n\nYou may need a fresh start without a referral because you might not find one. Keep looking for other work, but for now you might need to hate your work. Lots of people do.", "YTA! You got fired from your last job for lying about being sick.

See if you can get his blessing and get the job on your own. If not, thank him anyway and say you understand. Keep applying other places. It may take time but you\u2019ll find something. You seem very young based on your posts/this story so don\u2019t despair. Mistakes are how we learn. Harsh consequences help us grow. You\u2019ll get back on your feet.

Years ago I knew someone who got in a lot of shit because she called in sick and then got caught by her boss while she was shopping with her friends in the same mall she worked in. Like. Use your brain.", "Op is in the UK and already used their 25 paid vacation days and had 6 paid bank holidays.  I think OP would have been allowed to take the day unpaid.  Their sick days aren't for I need a day in 12 weeks to go to the dentist ( they can use a paid day, flex time etc for that) the sick days are for really being sick and from my understanding somebody who calls off sick two or three times a year won't ever be hassled for using those days. \n\nI worked for a couple companies that would pay you at the end of the year if you had unused sick/ personal days, they wanted to encourage people to not call out/ take days during black out times.", "The wheel is moving but the hamster is dead, so to speak. OP isn't overly bright", "Just from the way she responded to the brother, she says she \"May have shouted\"...\n\nlike yeah, this woman doesn't take accountability for herself, and thinks it's ok to yell at other people for being honest after she badgered him into talking about something he was clearly trying to avoid.\n\nShe sounds exceedingly entitled.  Work ethic issues indeed!", "Yeah, I can see the tiktoks now! I'm surprised the boyfriend is putting up with this. Most likely OP will be fired from her new \"jobs\" for similar behaviour.\n\nAlso, I don't think these jobs are real or at least haven't started yet. In 7 days she has supposedly started 2 jobs and worked at least 1 shift. Unless they were trial shifts in bars or mom and pop places, I can't see how she has had these jobs. The application, interview and pre-hire paperwork stages in the UK take at least 1 week unless it was a once-off, cash in hand type jobs", "OMG, you\u2019re right. \ud83e\udd2f", "No, at my job if you take sick time immediately before or after vacation time your vacation time gets cancelled and converted to sick time or u paid LOA. And using sick time for vacation is at the very least punishable even in my union job.", "It depends. Some places have PTO, which is for sick or personal leave. Other places have separate sick and personal leave. My husband, for example, gets unlimited sick leave but has a prescribed number of personal days. If he were to use sick days for a vacation, it would be dishonest and abusing the system. However, at his last job, he had PTO. So it would have been weird to lie about being sick given both kinds of leave came out of the same days, but if he had lied, he wouldn\u2019t have hurt anyone.", "Good point. I\u2019m not thinking clearly. Lol.  I don\u2019t think you can give a bad reference in the US either, just confirm employment dates.", "In the US, the 2 questions an employer is allowed to answer is confirming the date of employment and if they are eligible for rehire. \n\nIn this case, eligible for rehire would be a no, which is a big red flag.", "Actually just checked and you\u2019re quite right, my mistake. 36 counting the 8 bank holidays. I thought we get more of those than we do.", "Except op is in the UK and has statutory holiday of 20-odd days plus bank Holidays. Plenty of time for holidays and could have taken unpaid leave but chose to take paid sick leave (which most people don't get!)", "You are absolutely, but some companies require you to actually be sick in order to take them. Some have no fault sick days, take whenever you want/need, some don't. And when you agree to work at a place that requires you to use your sick time as sick leave and don't, there are going to be consequences to that.", "Exactly\u2026there\u2019s a difference between calling out sick as a mental health day where you just rest at home, or maybe you go get a massage or something, and taking off for a multi day holiday. And honestly if you\u2019re dumb enough to post about it on social, you deserve to be fired.", "I can\u2019t bear people with entitlement and shitty attitudes", "That\u2019s awesome! We only get 20 days PTO that work like yours and 5 floating holidays that don\u2019t roll over. It\u2019s definitely not enough, even with unlimited separate sick time", "She wasn't denied vacation; she had already used up all her vacation days for the year.", "OP has posted in subreddits asking for UK Specific advice so sadly I think they're okay.", "That's still more than I've ever had so again if your workplace is hiring please send me their way \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I guess if you have to prove it and don\u2019t try and post vacation pics you are pretty dumb", "Ironically if she'd said it was for a mental health condition that would've been more likely to be considered appropriate as she could have argued that the holiday was to improve her mental health. But she claimed she had a chest infection.\n\nTo add to that OP is in the UK where you can be fired within the first 2 years for any reason... but you are protected against discrimination against certain characteristics, disability being one of them. So she would have been more protected if she'd given mental ill health as a reason (although would never have won a case since there would be no evidence of a pre-existing mental health condition).\n\nIt just seems like the situation was poorly thought out and poorly executed on every single level.", "I have 31 days off in my eastern european country. Also paid", "How are you on Azure engineering?", "Ngl no clue. So probably not a great fit \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Ah well.
