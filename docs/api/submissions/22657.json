Your sister is being annoying as hell. Rude, even. But she\u2019s not ultimately hurting anyone and so publicly ridiculing her is really low and I\u2019m not surprised she cried. If you want to handle it like a grown adult, you privately talk to her calmly afterwards: \u201cHey, I just need you to know I felt hurt when you\u2026\u201d and you talk it out.

It's not the kind of dispute anyone should be wasting energy on.\n\n> Apparently my sister cried after\n\nThat's unacceptable. NTA... but only because your sister can't help but escalate.

Mom is only telling OP she did wrong and needs to apologize. She's not even saying \"you both were out of line, apologize to each other.\"\n\nOP, you're  NTA. She couldn't have held off for one afternoon. However, consider this one point: you should not have said anything. Hear me out. She had been doing it all afternoon. Everyone at the party had probably been through the act already. And I mean, it's natural conversation at someone's shower. If she's showing, it can't be like \"oh, I'm not talking about that.\" It is weird if she was directing people to ask so she could go through the routine. But it was actually fine while people were mingling. You can be annoyed because she's your sister, you naturally see her a lot and have heard her go through this routine many times. It's annoying and rolling the eyes is natural. My mom had this whole joke about our dog's breed when people asked. It was corny, a bit true, and funny the first few times I'd hear my mom tell someone. It did become annoying and I'd roll my eyes. It was so natural that I'd roll my eyes when the question was asked. \n\nAnyway, I've gotten away from myself and the point. So again, you shouldn't have said anything or more correctly, you didn't need to say anything. If she'd gone through the routine during mingling time and did this during the gift opening time, I think most intelligent people or at least people with common sense on manners would have possibly rolled their eyes with you. This was the specific time that the shower is completely about you. The spotlight is on you. So her pulling the act would have made others feel awkward, maybe squirm in their seat a bit, because that was blatantly rude. So they were feeling uncomfortable because she's there taking the spotlight from you. Or attempting to. Your reply to her only made the situation more awkward and tense. No one wants to see a fight at a shower between siblings. It's kind of like at a wedding, a MIL tries something and not having a plan (some groomsmen or people at the venue) to intervene, while the couple is oblivious or even if aware doesn't react. There's no large fight and that is what everyone would remember instead of it being a sweet wedding with one person trying to steal the spotlight. They are the bad guy and that's that. Same in this situation. Now obviously, as much as you probably would have loved for some big man to come escort your sister out telling her that she's not welcome. But let your sister do her routine. It's possible someone else would have said \"I'm glad your so excited to announce everything when your baby arrives, but OP is opening gifts so why don't we continue with that.\" So, again NTA for saying anything to your sister, but you should not have done in front of the audience. Hard, especially with your own hormones messing you up. The narrative could have been: OPs shower was great and I'm glad she got all those gifts, too bad her sister was so insistent on making it about her.\" Now the narrative might be \"well, that was certainly entertaining. How much did you want to sink into the floor during that thing with OP and her sister while OP was opening gifts?\" And a thought that just occurred is that because you knew this act and her attention seeking, you could have had a designated person to have been the one to speak up if your sister tried to steal the spotlight, which she did. It could have been your bff, a close friend, a close cousin or aunt (especially if they knew the act well.) Then it would have not been such a big deal and the guests would not have to be exposed to a sibling fight. \n\nAgain, NTA.", "This is true..nobody actually cares that much (or at all) about what the gender of a friend's baby is or what the name will be.

They asked for diapers more than anything else but ultimately specified that gifts were not really needed. It was nice to go and see family and get the other kids in the family hyped for their new baby cousin/little sibling.

Obviously for cases of rape where they don't want the terminate the pregnancy that makes sense but otherwise there are so many methods of birth control that even if somebody has to have sex there's still really no excuse to have a child if you're not financially ready for one.\n\nAnd yes, I guess birth control can fail but arguably that's too big of a wrist to take if you can't financially afford a child so you should either be using multiple methods of protection like a birth control pill and a condom, or just not having sex until you can financially afford a child.", "I find it extremely tacky as well.
