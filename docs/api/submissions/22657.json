We\u2019re not finding out the sex until birth, though we have 2 names picked out and have told people if they ask. I had my baby shower last weekend. My sister was there.

One had the name we picked out for a girl, the other with the one for a boy. My aunt explained I could hold onto the other one for if we had a second or donate it (both are pretty common names).
