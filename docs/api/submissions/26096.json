We got into a huge argument over me wanting my ex-wife Hannah (38F) there.\n\nGrowing up, I was an only child with a single mom. Pretty lonely. Except my mom was best friends with Hannah\u2019s mother so I grew up with her and her siblings plus her dad was always like the father figure I never had. We then got married young and have two kids together. As we got older into our 30s we both realized we missed out parts of our lives/careers and amicably split. After the divorce, we still worked on having a healthy relationship when co-parenting our sons and I\u2019m still extremely close with her parents, siblings, nieces/nephews whom I see all like my own.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to explain to her how Hannah\u2019s family is basically all the family I got and that I\u2019ve spent almost all of my life being treated like one of their own so I want them to be apart of this next milestone in my life (especially because they have all been so supportive of me finding love again).\n\nTowards the end of our argument, Alissa contested that they\u2019re not my family anymore, nor my blood relatives so there\u2019s no reason for them to be invited. If that\u2019s the case, the only \u201cfamily\u201d I would have at my wedding is my mom, my two kids, and a single cousin while she would have dozens of extended relatives and family friends who are not \u201cblood\u201d either.\n\nShe just kept saying \u201cyour \u2018family\u2019 being there will ruin my wedding\u201d and I just feel so torn. I\u2019m trying to be understanding of her feelings and this is her first marriage so I get why she is hell-bent on the \u201cperfect wedding day\u201d, but also I feel like I\u2019m asking for the bare minimum of having people who I\u2019ve considered family for 30+ years there.

No, this is just the beginning.\n\nI would NEVER marry someone who wanted me to give up my family and hurt my children.

For example are you going to want Christmas spent with your ex and her family and your wife, while she is going to want to keep things separate?\n\nI think you are asking for an IMMENSE amount of self-confidence and emotional maturity from your fianc\u00e9 and while she might not understand the depth of your relationship with your former in-laws, I don\u2019t know that you fully realize what you are asking of her and the perception it might cause.\n\nI\u2019m voting NAH and in my infinite wisdom, advising counseling.", "Nah.

Too many people do not realize this.", "Yes you would be. This is your fianc\u00e9s biggest day of her life.

Your wife not wanting to see your ex wife at the wedding isn\u2019t wrong, I think a good number of brides would feel the same. However, you wanting to invite your ex\u2019s parents and siblings shouldn\u2019t be denied since you have your own relationship with them. It may be a chance they won\u2019t come if their daughter/sister isn\u2019t invited but I wouldn\u2019t see the hurt/wrong of sending them a invitation.

Down the line is she gonna make this a deal breaker?", "I think it's a little creepy to invite your ex and her family to your new wife and your wedding.

These people were your family at some point and they will still be part of your life because they are your kids' grandparents. However, by marrying your fiancee you are starting a family with her. It is understandable why she wants the wedding day to be about you and her and not wanting to see people from your past there. Maybe she wants you to create a bond with her family since they will be your in laws from now on. What can she expect going further? Since you want to invite these people at your wedding, do you intend to do this for all the events in your life? For your next birthday, will you invite everybody (ex in laws, actual in laws, ex wife + wife) and ask them to play happy family? What if you have a kid with her? Will you impose these people for all the events in your shared life? Will she ever have privacy and celebrate things with HER family or do you intent to force a relationship between her and your ex family? \n\nAlso, how would you feel if she invites some exes and their families at your wedding?", "Woah.\n\nSo what's more than a red flag? A red flag that is on fire and has sparklers and flaming pinwheels attached? This sure is one.\n\nNTA.", "NTA my friend, this is likely not a good match for you.  \n\nAlso guarantee your sons will become some sort of issue, next.   \n\nHope I am calling it all wrong, but for her to be so opposed in these circumstances is not great. Your amicable co parenting is also likely to become an issue.", "Has she ever meet them? Has she always knows how you feel about them? It sounds like once you are married it\u2019s who she is allowed you to see and have around.\n\nBlood is not the only family. Family is people who love and support you. I would be worried how she would treat your kids or what she would say to them whe you are not around. Once you have children is she going to tell your child the other kids are not family or ignore them due to the new baby being the only real family?\n\nThis is just an eye opener.", "NAH. She doesn't want the ex-wife at the wedding which is understandable. He however wouldn't be able to celebrate his wedding with his family. Would she accept a compromise if ex-wife didn't attend but other 'family members' did?

Seeing the ex wife at the wedding is going to ruin it for your fiance.", "ESH\n\nI would *hate* it if the person I'm going to marry wanted his ex at the wedding. Alarm bells would be ringing left and right. However, she's not willing to compromise which is also bad.", "NTA.  Cancel the wedding.  This is just the beginning.  A successful and respectful co-parenting relationship is rare so beneficial to your children.  This woman will make every attempt to destroy that.  Think of your kids.  Don't marry her.", "NTA \n\nDump Alissa. She aint the one.

I'm living it. It's not anyone's fault, it's just a reality.  \nHer telling him who can/can't be at the wedding is a red flag.  \nHim wanting his ex-wife there IS weird and very obvious to see how it would be a red flag to someone who hasn't been married or had kids before and had to co-parent.   \n\n\nIf they're at this point and haven't discussed and come to an understanding on this MAJOR part of his life (his kids and the other side of the family she will have to deal with) they are *not* ready for marriage. - this is why ESH.", "NTA.

Unless she wants your kids out y'all's lives too.....\n\nYou need to think very, very carefully bout getting married to this.", "NTA. Alissa and some commenters are caught up on \"ex\" and missing \"lifelong family\". I think you need to consider delaying the wedding until you've worked this out. Regardless of her hang ups, these are also your kids' blood relatives. Are you sure she treats your kids right when you aren't there? If she can't accept that they are your extended family, she may not be the right one for you.", "NTA.  In fact your fianc\u00e9 100% is. Remove the ex-wife aspect from this for a second and think about how your fianc\u00e9 is trying to tell you that you aren't allowed to invite your best friends and closest chosen family members to YOUR wedding. Would you stand for it if she was like \"Nah, that guy you want to be your best man, he can't be there.\"  Absolutely not! This is no different, just so happens you slept with one them.\n\nI'm currently planning my wedding (his first, not mine) and I don't have a large family and an even smaller one if you count the people I care to talk to.  I will have three family members at our wedding...vs my fiance's 50 or so.  BUT, I will have my chosen family, all my closest friends, there. He has NO issue with that..and guess what, I slept with two of them in the past! I was in multi-year relationships with both...just so happens we make better friends than partners. Family isn't always blood, the best family usually isn't.\n\nThe presence of your family there won't ruin her wedding day, SHE will. She is the issue here, not the people you call family but her feelings about them. Personally, if I were you this is a hill I would chose to die on because this isn't going to get better.  What happens when you have kids together and want to invite your \"dad\" to they birthday party. Or when you want to take a family vacation which includes your ex wife and possibly her new husband because you coparent that well?
