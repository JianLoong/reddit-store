No one was able to start the ride because he wouldn\u2019t get off the course for over 30 minutes, I was so scared they were going to call security or the police to physically take him off. We finally managed to get him in the car & home but the entire process was almost 2 hours. \n\nI told my aunt about all of this when it happened and she brushed it off because everything ended up being fine. Back to our conversation I explained to her how if he were to do this at the airport & we all missed our flight that would not be fair to everyone else. It is a very extensive trip spanning multiple countries & lots of planning is going into it so my brother & I can spend quality time with our mom who we don\u2019t get to see often.

NTA. NTA. Do NOT let her guilt trip you into taking him! I hate that passive aggressive BS, she knew exactly what she was doing, she\u2019s trying to pawn off her difficult child on to you \u201csince you were already going to be doing all that stuff anyway.\u201d Not only was she not invited but she invited herself then backed out trying to leave you with a special needs child that you never invited in the first place.", "NTA: as a certified autistic person it is completely understandable and justified for you to refuse due to how he acts, particularly since he is 15. It's pretty irresponsible of your aunt and uncle to try and make you look after your cousin when you are going on vacation and i think that partly explains your cousin's behaviour as it isn't impossible to help him reduce the amount of meltdown's and i say this as a person who used to have meltdowns all the time as a child.", "NTA. It would have been irresponsible for you to chaperone your cousin for a trip this scale. It was rude of them to presume you would go along with their plans. You very politely declined.", "Totally NTA and do NOT let her guilt trip or manipulate you into caving in. Your concerns are valid. Your cousin is NOT your responsibility. \n\nYou are right to be concerned about him having his meltdowns that can get him mistaken and misunderstood as a public nuisance committing public disorder by people who do not understand autism and likely call the police on him. I have heard of real life cases of autistic people having meltdowns who are misunderstood to the point they are put in a lock up when the police mistaken them for causing public disorder", "NTA - your mother's sibling wants your family to take care of two generations with no assistance from them?", "NTA. I'd be uncomfortable taking a neurotypical 15 y/o on a trip like this when the original plan was that at least one of his parents was coming. A 17 y/o sibling when you're going to see your own parent is one thing, a 15 y/o cousin is another, especially when it seems like he can have meltdowns when presented with frustrations in a new environment (I mean, I'm ADHD and probably have autism and definitely can melt down under stress, so no judgment of cousin here, but this seems like maybe not even something he would *enjoy* without a parent present at this point?) Going on an extended trip abroad without a parent can be tough for NT 15 y/os if they're shy or introverted or anxious, and it sounds like he can have a tough time even on a short day out if things get frustrating or confusing and he's not with a parent, so this just seems like his parents pawning him off on you in a way that would make you, your brother, and him all pretty miserable and overwhelmed.", "NTA, at first I thought she was just inviting herself along but at the end it sounds like they\u2019re just looking for respite care.", "NTA. While he is your cousin, he is not your responsibility. If he wanted to go then your aunt or uncle should have arranged to go with him.", "NTA.  You explained your position, it is not your responsibility to use your vacation to take care of someone else's responsibilities.  I'm glad the message was received, so she won't bother you with this again.  When the other family members come at you for being \"harsh\", tell them that they are free to bring your cousin with them on their next family vacation.", "NTA. \n\nAutistic or not, it\u2019s completely unreasonable of your aunt and uncle to assume you\u2019re comfortable taking care of their MINOR child in another country without having a conversation with you first.", "NTA. Are they wanting your cousin to travel with you without either of his parents?  He is a minor. He is not your responsibility. You have organised and budgeted your trip for yourself, your brother, and your partners. Your aunt, uncle, and cousin are welcome to tag along, but responsible for their own costs and arrangements.  If your aunt try\u2019s to guilt trip you, calmly and politely call her out on it.  It is not appropriate to expect you to spend such a significant amount of time and money to look after her son, which essentially is what she is asking.", "NTA - zero guilt please, you are being manipulated.  No.  Is a complete sentence. \n\nSeriously, your Aunt is using guilt and manipulation to control you and to get what she wants\u2026it\u2019s super cool for you to stand your ground.  \n\nYou seem like a kind, mature and thoughtful, self aware human.  You acted very wisely and appropriately.", "NTA\u2014 I had a very similar situation travelling around in Europe a couple years ago, just me with an autistic younger sibling (21 at the time) for a month. It was extremely stressful and I had a hard time relaxing when I couldn\u2019t know what would upset them and couldn\u2019t access the usual accommodations that brought them comfort. It wasn\u2019t something I was prepared for even with my own sibling, let alone a 15 year old. It is okay if you\u2019re not comfortable with that responsibility! Even parents have a really hard time, let alone non-immediate family members who don\u2019t generally know how to read/solve situations when they arise.\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this position, it sucks to be called a bad person when you don\u2019t take up a challenging task for a special-needs family member whose capable parents won\u2019t even attempt the same thing themselves.\n\nEdit: wording", "Stick to your guns.

You were fine with your aunt and uncle tagging along and bringing their 15 year old,  but your aunt and uncle both cancelled. Who did they expect to be responsible for their kid - you? Really? How about no. This is you and your brother's trip, you're not traveling to Europe to watch *their kid*. That's ludicrous!

Your aunt can be as butt hurt as she wants at the end of the day that is HER son and she needs to be the one responsible", "NTA and no way in hell would I travel internationally with a kid that has meltdowns like that. You could all end up in jail in a foreign country. His parents need to travel with him and be 100% responsible for him at all times.", "NTA. Enjoy your trip, aunt can get bent.", "NTA\n\nMy understanding is schedules & routines best way to manage autism. With that in mind, think about planned trip from your cousin's perspective. DO NOT allow your aunt to guilt you. Your dream visit with your mom likely to be your cousin's idea of circle of hell. In this case, saying no kindest thing for your cousin.", "NTA", "As someone who is autistic NTA-\n\n we don\u2019t mean to have outbursts bursts and they can be very hard to control,you should not have to look after a 15 year old who is also autistic who has really bad breakdowns on your trip,he would be your responsibility and that\u2019s a lot of pressure to put on a person,you handled the situation the best you could,if she wants him to go she should go with him.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA at all. Their child is their responsibility, and it\u2019s wild for them to try to guilt trip you into taking him on an international trip without them. Honestly, regardless of autism. It\u2019s just not right of them.", "NTA\u2026.stop explaining.  Stop making it long.  Just say no.  You will not be taking your cousin on your trip.  You will not be responsible for him.  You will be enjoying your trip with your partner as a couple.  If they want their child to go, a parent will have to go with him and accompany him at all times.  There will be activities that will be couple activities only.  This is not a babysitting trip for them or you.  Just say nope.", "nope, don't do it, your uncle and aunt just want respite without having to pay for it", "NTA - autistic or not, you are not responsible for taking care of someone else's 15 year old on an international vacation.", "NTA-as the parent of an autistic child.\n\nYour aunt is out of her mind .\n\nNTA NTA NTA", "NTA in the slightest. You are being gentle and thinking about everybody's best interests.", "NTAH. My daughter is autistic and I would never travel this long with her exactly because of what you said above. It\u2019s a long trip, it\u2019s exhausting, she will be disruptive.", "NTA. You explained yourself clearly and set boundaries. She received and acknowledged those boundaries. She tried to get several weeks off, but luckily, you shut that shit down before he ended up in airport jail for threatening someone over some perceived slight. He", "NTA.\n\nDon't be surprised if they turn up with him at the airport and try to dump him on you though.\n\nBe prepared.", "Nope. She planned on pawning off her child onto youmfrom the getgo\u2026.she wants a vacation from her son.   \nNTA.", "And let\u2019s not go over the fact that it\u2019s a huge responsibility to take any 15-year-old out of the country. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be comfortable doing it even if they were a perfect angel. It\u2019s too many border crossings and opportunities for trouble.", "Yeah, to me, it sounds like she needs a break from the cousin and thought that, by trying to make OP let the cousin go with, she would get that break. It would be like her own vacation.", "This!! This is her problem. Don\u2019t let it become yours. You are not the AH!", "If they need respite care (which is understandable), then they need to FIND RESPITE CARE, not pawn their kid off on someone else.", "And slaves lack the capabilities to live in freedom, I suppose?", "Very rude. Basically it would destroy the trip OP & brother have planned, to spend to with their mother and travel and sightseeing. Spending all their time protecting and caring for their cousin would destroy that.\n\nAside from that the cousin is still legally a child, international travel with a minor that isn't your child can raise flags with immigration. Would the cousin be able to cope with being interviewed by immigration officials separately to his cousins?", "Aunt probably is desperate for a break and has been too ashamed to admit this to herself. Family needs to help her get this into the open after the trip ends and tempers cool down.  Many parents are too ashamed admit they need a break and this keeps them from finding appropriate resources for respite care.", "A hypothetical situation means zilch here.", "[removed]", "Yeah, I literally would not do this.  I live in Europe and have had a few family members try to send their young teen kids to visit me and I've said no - what would I do if they got into a serious accident?  What about alcohol?  In many countries around here they can order their own wine and beer, so now I also have to watch them like a hawk once they figure that out.  That is a whale of responsibility I am ill prepared for.", "This - I went on several school and organization sponsored overseas trips when I was a teen. At the time, it didn't seem like a huge deal. Now, as an adult, I have a REAL appreciation for the responsibiilty, stress and WORK it takes to shepherd a group of teens on an overseas trip.\n\nI know, for certain, I would not want to be personally responsible for a special needs child who was not my own on any kind of trip, ever.", "It\u2019s hard to believe they would even consider sending him without them. Your love and compassion may make them feel comfortable, knowing he would be safe, but they don\u2019t seem to appreciate the cost to *him* of being exposed to the many risks and triggers of traveling in another country without their support. Even if you were willing and eager, this would be a very bad idea. \n\nNTA.", "NTA!\n\nI have ASD. Most persons with ASD get varying degrees of anxiety to downright panic when dealing with change, transitions, etc.\n\nA trip like the one you describe is mega high stress in even the best of circumstances.\n\nSomeone with your cousin's issues would need familiar persons (his parents!!) as caregivers on such a trip -- not someone he does not know well.\n\nAirports and cramped conditions on airplanes suck. Time zone changes, changes in food, surroundings, etc. \n\nA neurotypical person would need a day or two to simply to adjust to the time zone differences.", "It\u2019s not about qualifications nor experience. Your posts make it rather obvious that you perceive him as a burden that you feel obligated to carry. Albeit unfortunate, it\u2019s valid. A low functioning person is a lot of responsibility and requires to make sacrifices. That\u2019s not a burden anyone should be guilted nor shamed into, and forcing it onto you just results in a disaster because the person is very likely to feel your annoyances.", "The way you described his gokart meltdown didn't feel as if you loved your cousin. The aunt is trying to be sneaky and my heart breaks for the ND boy whose parents want to pawn him off on someone who doesn't understand his issues.", "You're conflating awareness of a person's nature with a hypothetical", "!bot", "We were on a flight to Rome four years ago that was diverted because a boy (appeared to be a teen) had a meltdown over something food related.  The family was escorted off of the plane and we continued on.", "I do love my cousin & I\u2019m one of the only family members who takes him out on activities to get him out of the house because he doesn\u2019t have many friends. The only reason I described it the way I did was so everyone in this thread could understand the full extent of his meltdowns. It directly correlates to why I don\u2019t feel comfortable bringing him on such an elaborate trip. I felt it was important to include so people could see the full picture. \u2764\ufe0f"]}
