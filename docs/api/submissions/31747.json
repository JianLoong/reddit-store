My 17 year old brother & I along with our significant others are planning on going to see her as well as travel for 3 weeks this summer abroad. My aunt & uncle asked for details of the trip as she wanted to come along with my autistic cousin (15 years old). I had no problem with this & gave her the entire itinerary as well as the dates our flights were so they could best coordinate with our schedule. \n\nAs the days went on we were in touch & it went from all 3 of them going to just my uncle & cousin, to then her telling me I need to give her exact flight numbers because my cousin can\u2019t travel by himself. I very nicely explained to her that not only is there not enough room in our car for a 6th person (I had assumed they would have rented their own car if they were all coming along, my mom is picking us up from the airport in her car), but I also expressed how I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable being responsible for his safety halfway across the world for such a long period of time. \n\nEvery time I take him somewhere to make him feel included he has an episode, the last time was just a few months ago & it was the worst episode he\u2019s had. We went go karting & before everyone could even get in their go karts he started cursing out the staff because they \u201cgave him the wrong go kart number\u201d, then he froze in the middle of the road making weird faces & screaming. No one was able to start the ride because he wouldn\u2019t get off the course for over 30 minutes, I was so scared they were going to call security or the police to physically take him off. We finally managed to get him in the car & home but the entire process was almost 2 hours. \n\nI told my aunt about all of this when it happened and she brushed it off because everything ended up being fine. Back to our conversation I explained to her how if he were to do this at the airport & we all missed our flight that would not be fair to everyone else. It is a very extensive trip spanning multiple countries & lots of planning is going into it so my brother & I can spend quality time with our mom who we don\u2019t get to see often. I told her I would still love for her, my uncle, & cousin to come but they would have to make their own accommodations.\n\n I sent a long detailed paragraph & was very civil.

NTA. NTA. Do NOT let her guilt trip you into taking him! I hate that passive aggressive BS, she knew exactly what she was doing, she\u2019s trying to pawn off her difficult child on to you \u201csince you were already going to be doing all that stuff anyway.\u201d Not only was she not invited but she invited herself then backed out trying to leave you with a special needs child that you never invited in the first place.", "NTA: as a certified autistic person it is completely understandable and justified for you to refuse due to how he acts, particularly since he is 15. It's pretty irresponsible of your aunt and uncle to try and make you look after your cousin when you are going on vacation and i think that partly explains your cousin's behaviour as it isn't impossible to help him reduce the amount of meltdown's and i say this as a person who used to have meltdowns all the time as a child.", "NTA. It would have been irresponsible for you to chaperone your cousin for a trip this scale. It was rude of them to presume you would go along with their plans. You very politely declined.", "Totally NTA and do NOT let her guilt trip or manipulate you into caving in. Your concerns are valid. Your cousin is NOT your responsibility. \n\nYou are right to be concerned about him having his meltdowns that can get him mistaken and misunderstood as a public nuisance committing public disorder by people who do not understand autism and likely call the police on him. I have heard of real life cases of autistic people having meltdowns who are misunderstood to the point they are put in a lock up when the police mistaken them for causing public disorder", "NTA - your mother's sibling wants your family to take care of two generations with no assistance from them?", "NTA. I'd be uncomfortable taking a neurotypical 15 y/o on a trip like this when the original plan was that at least one of his parents was coming. A 17 y/o sibling when you're going to see your own parent is one thing, a 15 y/o cousin is another, especially when it seems like he can have meltdowns when presented with frustrations in a new environment (I mean, I'm ADHD and probably have autism and definitely can melt down under stress, so no judgment of cousin here, but this seems like maybe not even something he would *enjoy* without a parent present at this point?) Going on an extended trip abroad without a parent can be tough for NT 15 y/os if they're shy or introverted or anxious, and it sounds like he can have a tough time even on a short day out if things get frustrating or confusing and he's not with a parent, so this just seems like his parents pawning him off on you in a way that would make you, your brother, and him all pretty miserable and overwhelmed.", "NTA, at first I thought she was just inviting herself along but at the end it sounds like they\u2019re just looking for respite care.", "NTA. While he is your cousin, he is not your responsibility. If he wanted to go then your aunt or uncle should have arranged to go with him.", "NTA.  You explained your position, it is not your responsibility to use your vacation to take care of someone else's responsibilities.  I'm glad the message was received, so she won't bother you with this again.  When the other family members come at you for being \"harsh\", tell them that they are free to bring your cousin with them on their next family vacation.", "NTA. \n\nAutistic or not, it\u2019s completely unreasonable of your aunt and uncle to assume you\u2019re comfortable taking care of their MINOR child in another country without having a conversation with you first.", "NTA. Are they wanting your cousin to travel with you without either of his parents?  He is a minor. He is not your responsibility. You have organised and budgeted your trip for yourself, your brother, and your partners. Your aunt, uncle, and cousin are welcome to tag along, but responsible for their own costs and arrangements.  If your aunt try\u2019s to guilt trip you, calmly and politely call her out on it.  It is not appropriate to expect you to spend such a significant amount of time and money to look after her son, which essentially is what she is asking.", "NTA - zero guilt please, you are being manipulated.  No.  Is a complete sentence. \n\nSeriously, your Aunt is using guilt and manipulation to control you and to get what she wants\u2026it\u2019s super cool for you to stand your ground.  \n\nYou seem like a kind, mature and thoughtful, self aware human.  You acted very wisely and appropriately.", "NTA\u2014 I had a very similar situation travelling around in Europe a couple years ago, just me with an autistic younger sibling (21 at the time) for a month. It was extremely stressful and I had a hard time relaxing when I couldn\u2019t know what would upset them and couldn\u2019t access the usual accommodations that brought them comfort. It wasn\u2019t something I was prepared for even with my own sibling, let alone a 15 year old. It is okay if you\u2019re not comfortable with that responsibility! Even parents have a really hard time, let alone non-immediate family members who don\u2019t generally know how to read/solve situations when they arise.\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this position, it sucks to be called a bad person when you don\u2019t take up a challenging task for a special-needs family member whose capable parents won\u2019t even attempt the same thing themselves.\n\nEdit: wording", "Stick to your guns. Your aunt is way out of line trying to stick you with your cousin who has no business traveling with you.", "NTA.", "As an Autistic person I completely understand why you do not want to be responsible for their safety. It is not your job and you are not their guardian. Do not let your aunt guilt trip you. She is the responsible adult and legal guardian, so she can look after your cousin. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou, your brother, and your SOs are taking a trip to visit your mom and do some traveling in Europe. You did not invite anyone else. You were fine with your aunt and uncle tagging along and bringing their 15 year old,  but your aunt and uncle both cancelled. Who did they expect to be responsible for their kid - you? Really? How about no. This is you and your brother's trip, you're not traveling to Europe to watch *their kid*. That's ludicrous!

I work with kids like your cousin and just a simple outing can be very stressful and exhausting even with all the training we have to manage meltdowns and behaviors.

It's unfair they are trying to guilt trip you so don't let them. It's totally understandable to decline!", "NTA, and frankly, would probably be an extremely cruel thing to do to your cousin. He already struggles with outings in familiar places, there\u2019s no way a trip like this wouldn\u2019t be a nightmare for him. He wouldn\u2019t even have his parents to help him.", "Nta.

It\u2019s complete BULLSHIT!  OP is much nicer than I would have been and I\u2019m a really nice person.", "It\u2019s nice to hear from someone who can relate to my cousin!

He isn't even allowed to 'just' go with you, and if you refuse to be the legal adult officially, he can't go. \n\nI'd recommend to check for your brother also who is not 18 yet if any official forms need to be signed to make sure everything is is in order for him to come with you.", "NTA - If they cannot function at all, they would never enjoy a trip anyway.", "NTA\n\nHer minor son is not your responsibility. \n\nDo enjoy your trip. \n\nDo not let her guilt you.", "NTA, my brother is autistic and i have had situations where my parents made me feel like the ahole because i wanted to go do things and not have to look after my brother. \n\nYour cousin is not your responsibility, and you need to look after yourself.

She immediately saw a way for them to get a break by having you take your cousin on the trip yourself,  and tried to be sly by easing you into the idea rather than outright asking you to take cousin yourself. I can sympathise as it must be hard for them, but the backhanded way she went about it makes her the AH.", "NTA\n Your cousin is 15 years old.
