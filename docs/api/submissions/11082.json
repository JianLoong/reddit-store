It\u2019s had a profound impact on her life and it affects her nearly daily.\n\nAt the wedding, so as to keep things even and equal, we both decided to keep the top table to our mothers, and best man/head bridesmaid, and reserve the middle table directly in front for close family.\n\nI told him this and he went ballistic.

He's literally being excluded for optics, that doesn't excuse his behavior but that has to be incredibly painful.\n\nDecide right now whether whatever inheritance you stand to get is worth dealing with his antisocial behavior.

NTA.", "NTA - Let him know you had reconsidered and that was what you were calling about but with his recent actions you will stand by what you said. Threatening you is unacceptable even if he is hurt.", "ESH.  I was missing a parent at my wedding.  You know what I didn\u2019t do, use it as a poor excuse to treat my partner\u2019s living parent like crap.  That\u2019s a really horrible thing to do.  If I had suggested it, I would hope my SO would call me out on it.  My word what a disgusting outlook your wife has.  Your dad is no better.  Do you realize you are marrying your dad?  They pull the same horrible nonsensical manipulation.", "NTA. Tell him he's not invited and he can keep his money.", "This is true. But I can also say if op feels he isn\u2019t important enough parent to be set with the other parents then he should not feel entitled to his dads money now or ever. \n\nDad by no means should not have threatened him. He should have just changed his will. But you can\u2019t leave a parent out of important milestones. And I can see where his dad would be hurt. Then don\u2019t feel entitled to their money in life or death.", "Only golddiggers change their mind just because money enters the discussion.", "This was my problem with the whole situation. They could have included him or moved both mothers from the head table. Like you said if it\u2019s his behavior then I would say NTA.\n\nAnd just throwing this out here. Do you know how hard it is to diagnose dementia. And usually before a diagnosis of dementia or neurological problems are discovered peoples behavior change and the get like op\u2019s dad.", "Do you have like 2 personalities? Lmao. Now you're all about family, but when it comes to babysitting? Time to set some BouNDaRiES", "Fuck that it\u2019s reparations for dad being an abusive asshole.", "You can absolutely leave a parent out of milestone when they act like this. OP said he was always \u201cverbally and physically angry\u201d, which is literally abuse. If you\u2019re always screaming around your wife and your child, and likely physically aggressive - _even if you never directly touch them_ - you are an abuser and it\u2019s a just deserts if you get cut out for your victim\u2019s peace of mind.", "Do a sweet heart table, just the two of you, problem solved.", "YTA\nPunishing your dad because hers died?\nShe needs therapy. WTF?", "Everyone is the asshole but you. Losing a percent doesn't mean making your partner lose out on huge life moments with theirs - my father has died recently but I'd never expect or have the audacity to ask my fiance to cut his dad from certain life events to make me feel better. And your dad is obviously an asshole for various fucking reasons like being a terrible father and also threatening you", "NTA do not bow to his wishes.  His behavior is just another form of abuse, mental and emotional.   He needs to be called out on it and told that if he continues, then he may not be a part of your life anymore.  Do not allow him to continue his abuse of you and do not let him start on your wifel", "NTA. Another option that is popular now is just having a \u2018sweetheart\u2019 table so just the two of you sit at the \u2018head\u2019 table and then bridal party and parents, grandparents etc are seated at the tables closest to the front. Think pulpit in front of the church and the pews in a semi circle around the pulpit. Hope that visual makes sense. But whatever you decide, you\u2019re NTA", "NTA let him disinherit you. Do you really want to spend the rest of his life being manipulated by him? Don\u2019t give him that power", "NTA. Eh, I'd rather be disinherited by not inviting him. He won't follow the rules. He will do anything you want to hurt you and ruin things.", "It's your call. If you don't want him at the table then don't.  But prepare for any consequences.  You may get removed from his will. More likely he's going to make a serious scene at the wedding.  NTA", "NTA, but you will be if you give into his selfish demands. It's your wedding, not his and he has no right to anything. \n\nBut seeing as he's disinheriting you anyway, I'd uninvite him to the whole thing and make sure security is on hand to keep him out. \nHe cannot behave this way and face no consequences.", "NTA: Do you want this man around your future kids? The inheritance threat can and will come up again if you capitulate now.\n\nUninvite and cut off contact unless and until meaningful change is achieved and maintained. Your future family deserves it. Mental health is priceless.", "He's not going to leave you anything anyway. Kind,  loving parents do not disinherit their kids for anything less than a catastrophic problem (drug abuse, stealing,  murder) not seating at your wedding. I'd uninvite him.  He's going to make a scene no matter where you put him.  If you give in,  you lose. If you don't,  you'll still lose.  Just send him packing.", "Conditional NTA. You sated rationale for leaving him out of the main table was moronic and in most other situations I would be calling you the AH or sayinng everyone sucks here.\n\nHowever there are obvious reason for why he shouldn't even be allowed at the wedding, let alone at the main table.\n\nAs for the inheritance game don't even play it. That would bring you back to AH status. Are you trying to bribe the inheritance out of your father? And what makes you so sure that he won't disinherit either way?", "There is freedom in letting go. If he uses threats of disinheritance, that\u2019s okay. The likelihood that there would be anything there for you at the end of his life is unknown. He could remarry, and leave everything to another wife. He could get very ill, and spend everything on medical treatment. So let go of the concerns of disinheritance. \n\nThe real question is not whether he should be at the top table, but whether he should be at the wedding at all. Sounds like he\u2019s guaranteed to create a scene. You, your bride, your mother, and the families are entitled to enjoy the day without your father\u2019s belligerence, hostility, and ill manners. \n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nLet him, you can earn your own money, you can invest in assets that you want to invest in. You aren't losing out on anything but getting cut out of his will. And maybe he'll realize he's being a miserable geezer.", "My answer is sweetheart table for 2. And let everyone else sit together at a different table", "NTA - Do not let this nasty person hold you emotionally hostage.  Personally I would exclude him from the wedding just for being that way. \n\nHe will use the disinheriting you over and over if he finds out it works, don\u2019t let him.  \n\nMy father was like this, he thought he could hold an inheritance over my head, I chose to walk away without one.  You are the only one that can make the decision as to what you can live with, but for your own sakes, do not give in because he is being a loud bully, he will make you regret giving in to him.  Your wedding is supposed to be a celebration, don\u2019t let him ruin those memories.", "ESH all parent should be seated at the family table not the top table. Singling out you father and seating him away from you mother makes YTA. His reaction makes him one too.", "ESH. Do you honestly think she\u2019s not going to miss her father no matter what you do? That\u2019s rude to exclude one person! He\u2019s terrible for hanging the inheritance over your head.", "Or there isn't anything left but bills", "He will do it one way or the other. People like his father use money as a power tool. Op might do everything he wants and still be left out of the will. \nHe was a crappy father all his life he doesn't even deserve an invite.", "NTA\n\nYour dad will pull this when grandchildren enter the picture.\n\nHeads up: Ornery nasty people reportedly have a higher survival rate in hospitals than humble kindly people.\n\nThis was the consensus on the Nursing subreddit -- they were talking about horrible patients vs sweet ones.", "Because it\u2019s not the real reason\u2014it\u2019s the safe reason that can be said out loud, but the real reason is that they don\u2019t like Dad and don\u2019t want him to be a major part of their day. And that sucks, but let\u2019s cut the grease here. I feel like this about a number of family members, and it\u2019s very hard, and I feel for them as they work through this.", "Hahahah I love this people but family but when it's with them they do not put their money where their mouth is.", "Yeah, the nice ones don't stick around but the difficult ones seem to live forever", "That not how it works. Op is absolutely in his right not include his dad. \n\nDad is in his rights to spend, donate or give his money to a random person. \n\nNo one is entitled to anything.", "You can absolutely leave them out.\n\nBut op talked like he was upset he was being disowned and not getting an inheritance which is also ok. \n\nNo one is entitled to be included in a wedding and no one is entitled to a inheritance was my point.", "This! From the story, it's clear the man has been and continues to be abusive. This might be how OP justifies the decision (that it's out of love for his partner) when really I think it comes from resentment or just plain \"he's not that important to me\" - which is fair. Going low/no contact with a parent is a really difficult decision but tbh OP, I'd ask yourself if you get anything from this relationship. It sounds like the divorce is a direct consequence of his actions - he is not the victim in this situation and is old enough to act differently/take accountability. I know uninviting the dad altogether might mean breaking the relationship and is probably a really uncomfy choice, but at this point, he's a loose cannon no matter what you offer him (and probably always was). I wouldn't trust him at my wedding and I wouldn't want the stress of worrying about what he might do, and I also frankly wouldn't want someone there who can't put the happiness of his child above his own for one day. It's your day - don't let him ruin it.", "If you're mean enough, even Death himself won't want to deal with you.", "I didn\u2019t see that he was upset about it. The only thing in the actual post about the will is literally the dad threatening to cut him out of it _when OP was actually going to concede and let him have what he wanted_. I saw nothing about OP being upset about the will. My understanding is that OP is upset that he has hurt his father so much he\u2019s ready to go to that length. And on the other hand, the ultimatum actually proves that he does not, actually, deserves a seat at that table. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, this is a victim still feeling bad about hurting his abuser, even if it\u2019s deserved. Has OP been actually upset about money in the comments?"]}
