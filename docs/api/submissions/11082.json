It\u2019s had a profound impact on her life and it affects her nearly daily.\n\nAt the wedding, so as to keep things even and equal, we both decided to keep the top table to our mothers, and best man/head bridesmaid, and reserve the middle table directly in front for close family.\n\nI told him this and he went ballistic.

Don't  let your life become subject to his petty whims. \n\nIf it were me, I'd ban him from the wedding, stop talking to him at all, and hire security to make sure he's removed if he tries to show up anyway.

Your primary reason for excluding him is because it might remind your fiancee that she doesn't have a dad?

I might have given an NTA if the primary reason was his behavior, but you said that is a secondary concern to your fiancee not having a dad. He's literally being excluded for optics, that doesn't excuse his behavior but that has to be incredibly painful.\n\nDecide right now whether whatever inheritance you stand to get is worth dealing with his antisocial behavior.
