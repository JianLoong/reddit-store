He and my mother divorced last year after 50 years of marriage because he\u2019s getting worse. We really don\u2019t think he\u2019s got dementia or anything like that, he can turn it off when he wants; but since the divorce he\u2019s clearly a very angry man. It\u2019s taken a good couple of years of therapy to come to terms with the fact he was a very angry father, both physically and verbally and his behaviour was not ok, and I do resent him for that a little.\n\nMy soon-to-be-wife (30F) lost her father when she was a young child. It\u2019s had a profound impact on her life and it affects her nearly daily.\n\nAt the wedding, so as to keep things even and equal, we both decided to keep the top table to our mothers, and best man/head bridesmaid, and reserve the middle table directly in front for close family.\n\nI told him this and he went ballistic. He said it\u2019s his right to be on the top table, he\u2019s family, and believes my mother has \u201cput me up to this to ostracise him from the family\u201d (his usual response to ANYTHING nowadays). It is also partly because he can be INCREDIBLY inappropriate and we are both worried he will attempt to make an unwanted speech, which would be a terrible idea for a number of reasons\u2026 as much distance between him and the mic as possible would be best.\n\nSince the conversation my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to just let him sit there because it means alot to him. I called him to tell him he can sit there, but before I could say a word, he said \u201cI\u2019m on that top f*cking table or you\u2019re out the will. I\u2019m not being ostracised by your mother.\u201d And put the phone down.\n\nI feel awful. On the one hand, it\u2019s our day, and it\u2019s what we want especially for my fianc\u00e9 to not feel like she is missing a parent, but on the other I can see how much it has hurt him. I understand he is hurting right now, especially with the divorce, but I still hold some resentment for how abusive he was. AITA?

Repeat. Repeat. 20 years later you have made a hundred compromises, you have had major events and major decisions in your own life spoilt by doing things his way. And then he dies and leaves it all to his mistress or to his dog anyway. You threw away 20 years of autonomy for nothing.", "NTA\n\nDon't invite him at all.

He doesn't 'have the right', it is up to you and your fiance to decide. Period. Protect your day, protect your happiness - block him from your life. You have finally started to see the impact he's had, don't let him continue his reign of tyranny.\n\nAs others have said, he is using his will as the last bit of leverage to try to strong arm you into doing what he wants.  It isn't worth it - call his bluff, and even if he does 'write you out', you should be seeking to gain freedom from him anyway.", "NTA. Uninvite him and tell him to shove his inheritance.

Him being an asshole is a pretty good reason not to include him. \n\nChoosing not to include him so that the table looks balanced and so fiancee doesn't have to think about not having a dad, that's both pretty fucked up and inherently flawed. She's still not gonna have a dad, it's still going to be at the front of her mind all day, he's still going to be in your family's row when she walks down the aisle without hers. \n\nThe man sounds deeply unpleasant, if I were you I'd tell him that if wants people to want him around that he should act like it, tell him you're disappointed he'd threaten your place on the will over something like this, and tell him why that's why he's not allowed at the wedding and that you and mom will have a better time for it. \n\nNta", "QUESTION:  How will you feel when, at the wedding, and he\u2019s sitting at the top table, starts getting belligerent and making a scene, and your wife starts to cry?  Because you have to know that will happen.  It seems to me, OP, that you are uncomfortable standing up to your father, and I totally understand that, but it still has to be done.  At this point, you should uninvite him altogether because he\u2019s going to cause a big scene no matter where you seat him.", "NTA cut him out of your life.

You don't have to do what anyone else wants, and it's not okay that your father is bullying you.  It's amazing that you're empathizing with him and very generous of you to want to let him sit at the head table after he's been so inapproriate and unkind.  \n\nNo matter what you decide, you should ask for an apology for his behaviour, and start setting some boundaries with him where you shut down his aggression as soon as he starts it.

What are you going to have to give in to then?", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe him a damn thing. If he\u2019s going this ballistic over seating arrangements, he\u2019s not safe to have at the wedding.

I hope it\u2019s the day you both want it to be and free of abusive relatives.", "NTA - it's your wedding.\n\nBUUUUT > you decision from his point-of-view is unnecessarily antagonistic.  It does appear that you have \"picked your mom\" over him.  If you have, that's OK, it's your choice. I personally think it's a very bad look, both for you and him.  The option I personally would go for is just not have any parents at the \"top table\".  Then, all this drama goes away.\n\nWhat is it about weddings that cause so much drama?  Should be one of the happiest days, and it is nothing but pain.  My niece got married a while ago, and my wife was up in arms because they didn't ask any of our kids to be in wedding... gawd who cares.  Saved me money and time.

You say he was abusive, that lately he is increasingly unpleasant and angry, you (rightfully) resent him, and are worried he will make a scene at your wedding... And on top of it all he's trying to bully his way into a place of honor he hasn't earned and doesn't deserve? \n\nThis man is a toxic strain on you, your life, and if you let him, your marriage. How do you think your fiance will feel with your father there being shitty, instead of her dad, who she misses and dearly wishes was still around to be there? Your father do what he wants with his will, you can't control that, and if he's willing to threaten it over this you can be sure he will do it again. Maybe next time it will be getting to visit your home, watch your kids, or \"borrow\" your money. Don't  let your life become subject to his petty whims. \n\nIf it were me, I'd ban him from the wedding, stop talking to him at all, and hire security to make sure he's removed if he tries to show up anyway. You & your fiance's new life together should come before his BS.", "NTA?\n\nNot having him at the top table because he is an AH is fair. Consequence of his actions.\n\nBut if he was not an AH, and he is not being  seated there just because your bride lost her dad, is not fair to you and borders on bridezilla territory.", "NTA. Do let him know you were about to offer it before that ultimatum. Hopefully you get an excuse to never speak to him again.", "ESH. Your primary reason for excluding him is because it might remind your fiancee that she doesn't have a dad? She is well aware, and that is a crappy reason to exclude somebody from an important life event. I might have given an NTA if the primary reason was his behavior, but you said that is a secondary concern to your fiancee not having a dad. He's literally being excluded for optics, that doesn't excuse his behavior but that has to be incredibly painful.\n\nDecide right now whether whatever inheritance you stand to get is worth dealing with his antisocial behavior. Assuming it's not, tell him that you love him but it's his money to do with as he pleases, but he won't be dictating what you do.", "Do what you want but he has every right to disinherit you.\n\nSeating him elsewhere is a grave insult and I can understand why he is hurt.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
