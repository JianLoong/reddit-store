Don't  let your life become subject to his petty whims. \n\nIf it were me, I'd ban him from the wedding, stop talking to him at all, and hire security to make sure he's removed if he tries to show up anyway.

Your primary reason for excluding him is because it might remind your fiancee that she doesn't have a dad?

I might have given an NTA if the primary reason was his behavior, but you said that is a secondary concern to your fiancee not having a dad. He's literally being excluded for optics, that doesn't excuse his behavior but that has to be incredibly painful.\n\nDecide right now whether whatever inheritance you stand to get is worth dealing with his antisocial behavior.

Just so that you don't hold any potential inheritance as contingent on something that you may or may do/have done.", "He\u2019s going to disinherit you anyway. Cut him out now and be done with his ass. Save yourself some heartache. NTA.", "NTA - Let him know you had reconsidered and that was what you were calling about but with his recent actions you will stand by what you said. Threatening you is unacceptable even if he is hurt.", "ESH.  I was missing a parent at my wedding.  You know what I didn\u2019t do, use it as a poor excuse to treat my partner\u2019s living parent like crap.  That\u2019s a really horrible thing to do.  If I had suggested it, I would hope my SO would call me out on it.  My word what a disgusting outlook your wife has.  Your dad is no better.  Do you realize you are marrying your dad?  They pull the same horrible nonsensical manipulation.", "NTA. Tell him he's not invited and he can keep his money.", "This is true. But I can also say if op feels he isn\u2019t important enough parent to be set with the other parents then he should not feel entitled to his dads money now or ever. \n\nDad by no means should not have threatened him. He should have just changed his will. But you can\u2019t leave a parent out of important milestones. And I can see where his dad would be hurt. Then don\u2019t feel entitled to their money in life or death.", "Only golddiggers change their mind just because money enters the discussion.", "This was my problem with the whole situation. They could have included him or moved both mothers from the head table. Like you said if it\u2019s his behavior then I would say NTA.\n\nAnd just throwing this out here. Do you know how hard it is to diagnose dementia. And usually before a diagnosis of dementia or neurological problems are discovered peoples behavior change and the get like op\u2019s dad.", "Do you have like 2 personalities? Lmao. Now you're all about family, but when it comes to babysitting? Time to set some BouNDaRiES", "Fuck that it\u2019s reparations for dad being an abusive asshole.", "You can absolutely leave a parent out of milestone when they act like this. OP said he was always \u201cverbally and physically angry\u201d, which is literally abuse. If you\u2019re always screaming around your wife and your child, and likely physically aggressive - _even if you never directly touch them_ - you are an abuser and it\u2019s a just deserts if you get cut out for your victim\u2019s peace of mind."]}
