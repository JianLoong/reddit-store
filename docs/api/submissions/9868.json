I'm going to tell you something you probably already know...\n\nYour boyfriend is a dick.\n\nFind a Prince Charming who loves you for you.\n\nAnd ignore everything he says about your job. I have a normal job, and when people ask me about it, I can see the life drain from their eyes the moment I try to explain it to them. I would honestly have about 7,000 follow up questions if I was to converse with a Party Princess. You have an interesting job that you love. Your bf can go kiss a frog as far as I'm concerned.\n\nOf course NTA.", "NTA. When I saw the title I thought the job would be something sexual in nature. Something that might make conservative parents uncomfortable. There's nothing embarrassing about being a party entertainer.\n\nAlso, what is he expecting? He wants you to make up a job and details about it and then for the rest of your relationship try to remember the lies you've told about this job to keep up the charade? That's nuts and a lot of mental work. On top of being dishonest and a recipe for disaster. What if they find out somehow from someone else? Like someone they know books you and they see photos or something? Then you'd look like a maniac who invented a fake job.", "NTA. You should find someone who can accept you for who you are. This relationship won't last long.", "NTA, you're earning good money and enjoy what you do, people would kill to have that.\n\nOwn it.", "NTA- keep the job throw away the man who doesn\u2019t respect you or your career.", "NTA ask him if he would more be proud of an unemployed girlfriend?\n\nIt sounds like a great business.", "NTA - don't lie about your job.  It's amazingly disrespectful for him to even ask you, and it's a \ud83d\udea9 in my eyes.  He's embarrassed about what you do for a living, which is to bring joy and happiness to tons of people, especially children.  Would he feel this way if you were Snow White at Disney World?  I doubt it.\n\nPlus, lying about something as basic as your job will come back to bite everyone as soon as they start asking you even the most basic questions.  If you plan to stay with this guy (BIG if...), can you imagine how bad it will be for you and for him in a year when the truth comes out?", "NTA. Don't lie. Not only is your job nothing to be embarrassed about, you also love your job and make good money doing it. That's something most of us only dream of. Your boyfriend is the one who looks childish here.", "NTA.\n\n\nHonestly the job sounds fun! If it pays the bills, what\u2019s there to be embarrassed over?", "NTA. I bet its a lot of fun and its probably an important part of who you are.\n\nFor most of us work is a pretty big part of our lives, its concerning that he wants you to lie about this.", "\"My boyfriend of 7 months however is rather embarrassed by this job ..\"  \n\n\nI've seen enough.  No, don't ever lie about what brings you joy in life and never date a person who is against that.   NTA.", "NTA.  He\u2019s embarrassed by a job you love and make good money doing.  That is such his problem.  I wouldn\u2019t lie, but I would reconsider the relationship.", "NTA - you should do what makes you happy , and also you should consider what makes you happier, would telling a white lie to make your boyfriend happier make you happy, or would being true to yourself make you happier.", "NTA! Don't let him make you feel bad about your job. He is the one who has a problem.", "NTA. Be honest. The fact that he finds your job embarrassing is his problem to deal with, not yours.", "Let's be clear: \n\n* You're an *actress*. That's fundamentally what you're doing, just in very specific venues and circumstances. There's absolutely no difference between what you're doing and, say, getting up on stage in costume, or in motion capture equipment to be part of a video game. \n* You're an *entrepreneur*. You've taken this niche and turned it into a thriving business. That's actually really goddamned hard and you deserve kudos. \n\nNow, this is all obvious to me from a couple of paragraphs and should be obvious to you boyfriend, too. \n\nNTA, of course. And it would be perfectly fair to describe yourself to friends and family as \"actress and entrepreneur\" but how they react to any of this is on them, not you.", "NTA and your job sounds awesome. If I had to take a guess I would say that he is embarrassed that you make MORE than him in a job that he sees as lesser.", "NTA, we have an absolutely amazing company here that does this and the people are SO talented and make such a difference. They do birthday parties and special events and also volunteer at our children\u2019s hospital. It\u2019s the best job and you make the world a better place for kids. If he\u2019s not proud of you, time to ditch him.", "NTA! This sounds like a fun and lucrative job, and it must bring a lot of joy to the customers. Your bf is so embarrassed that he wants you to lie about your job, which isn't a good sign (although it's better that you know about this just seven months into dating him so you can decide about this relationship accordingly).", "NTA. He is ridiculous for being embarrassed about you having a good and interesting job. You make children happy for a living (and a good living at that)! How could he think that\u2019s not great?", "NTA.\n\nWhat you do is part of who you are.  There's never any shame in doing any job to support yourself, but if you like doing it then it really is a part of you.\n\nYour BF needs to get over himself or find another GF he's not embarrassed by.", "If your bf feels embarrassed by how you earn a living, he shouldn't be your bf.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt's a totally reasonable job, you shouldn't be forced to lie just because he's insecure.  What if you two end up staying together long-term?  Does he just expect you to keep lying and keep this secret forever?  Plus, 99% chance his friends and family won't care anyways.", "He\u2019s actually telling you a lot about himself and about his family.   \n  \n  \nNTA.", "NTA. Not only it\u2019s a great job, it also pays well and it makes for amazing conversation! I\u2019m sure everyone you meet would love to hear your stories. I don\u2019t know if you ever played Ariel, but in my daughter\u2019s birthday we had a gorgeous Ariel wheeled in an OFFICE CHAIR. My husband and I laughed forever about this! we made eye contact with the mermaid and she also knew it was hilarious. All the girls were mesmerized by the appearance and never noticed, all they cared about was that Princess Ariel was there lol. Anyway, your BF is not getting it at all if he doesn\u2019t see that you bring incredible joy and fantasy to so many kids.", "NTA. Keep the job, ditch the boyfriend.", "NTA\n\nBe proud of your career", "NTA! You should look into twitch as another revenue stream. Lots of people who dress up on there and stream as their job", "Don't lie. If your bf is this ashamed of you, I'd reconsider being him. But maybe make it sound a little more like a \"real job\". \"I'm a children's entertainer\" sounds a bit more like a job than \"party princess\".", "I would like to be a princess professionally. Yet I'm only a peasant \nDitch the ogre tho. Nta", "First of all NTA and you deserve someone who appreciates what you do! I\u2019ve actually been a party princess too, and watching those kiddos light up is a beautiful and magical thing. That being said, do you mind if I ask which city you\u2019re in OP? I fell out of parties during pandemic and would love if you had advice on how to get back into it", "Your job is so amazingly cool and your boyfriend sounds so unpleasant.\n\nNTA\n\nPS: I wish I could be a party princess \ud83d\udc78\ud83c\udffb", "Yes, you should lie. When asked, you should say \u201cI have the same job BF does, but there\u2019s no money in it, so next week I start my new job as a party princess making twice as much!\u201d This should clear up his concerns.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your job is something you\u2019re clearly passionate about, you enjoy it, you bring joy to people\u2019s lives, and you make a decent amount of money doing it. I don\u2019t see the issue.

If you do want to keep the peace you could perhaps just word it differently, say you work in events or entertainment or something like that, but you really shouldn\u2019t have to.

Him saying he\u2019s embarrassed by your job (which sounds like an awesome job btw), is him saying he\u2019s embarrassed by you. Do you really want to be with someone like that? You deserve someone who supports you and is proud of you. He\u2019s an ass. Ps.

Him being embarrassed about a job you love that doesn't negatively impact or harm him in any way is his personal issue. He is asking you to silence a part of you that you really like.

You provide such a lovely service to people and their families.", "NTA why stay with a man who is ashamed of you?", "NTA. I think you kissed the wrong frog, my friend.

Then he could control her every move.  I see red flags that are obvious.  others \"could never have foreseen the signs.\"", "Oh it's a lot of fun! I sing for the kids based on what character the people who booked me pick, we play games, I read them a book, then we do tattoos (temporary ones don't worry!) and before I leave we do pictures and I give a gift to whatever child the party was for. My booking fee factors in the cost of the gift as it's part of the experience.", "honestly I love this job so much and it gives me a lot of joy and you're right it's part of who I am, i've been considering trying to join at a management level when I \"age out\" and can't play the Princesses anymore.", "Ariel is one of my costumes yes! I do both Princess Ariel and Mermaid Ariel. Oh I can just imagine that entire situation! It's so funny I hope she kept the costume clear of the wheels as I know *exactly* how that could go wrong! It's so hard to keep a straight face in those kind of situations but the kids amazement makes it worth it.", "I'm in the UK, I assume you're in the US?", "What country are you from if you don't mind me asking? We're making a surge in many different countries now so it may have changed and I know others who have been booked for adults who want to relive that childlike joy. So i'd say it's not impossible.", "Was that a story on here? seems I missed that one. That really annoys me as Ms Frizzle is fantastic.", "Thank you! well if you have any questions i'm happy to answer, I won't link to my socials or pictures of my catalogue as i'm not here to promote myself and if I do that I know some will think i'm here for that but if you have anything you're curious about i'm happy to answer.", "NTA, you do you.  If he doesn't accept you for who you are, you do you without the BF.", "No matter how big it is, she can buy something bigger", "You can the move on to playing the Queens. Better roles, IMO.", "Oh she was a total pro! looked just like Ariel and you have no idea how the kids reacted when they saw her. Like a silent reverence and then screaming in excitement because Ariel was there!!!! Only my husband and I saw that she was wheeled in an office chair and we found it so funny. Anyway, back to you. What you do is priceless! I\u2019d be so proud to deliver joy on the daily to so many families. Especially right now. And i\u2019m sure for you it\u2019s an emotionally fulfilling job. If i were in your BF\u2019s family I\u2019d be so proud of you and also be like, tell me your funniest stories! I\u2019m sure you have tens of them.", "Yeah it was! IIRC he resorted to lying that his mom was ashamed of how she dressed, only for his mom to expose him AND ream his ass out", "I mean if it's over 7 inches she could probably make things work"]}
