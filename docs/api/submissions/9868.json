That said, it reads as if he\u2019s actually more concerned about his family\u2019s opinion, and while I get that it can be a big deal to have your loved ones\u2019 approval on a new partner, asking said partner to lie or change is never the right call. OP shouldn\u2019t feel like she has to be anything other than herself, and if he doesn\u2019t like it or his family\u2019s approval is more important to him then he can take a hike.\n\nBesides, once OP has built up this network of clientele, plus established her operating procedures and acquired the occupational tools such as makeup and dresses etc., for her business, well who\u2019s to say that she couldn\u2019t take on a more managerial role some time in the future if she so chose, and then hire other young actors and actresses to scale her earning potential beyond her own hourly rate?

I think you deserve someone who thinks you're awesome and doesn't want to hide or lie about you.", "You could, but either way, NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to work on his acceptance of your job, which sounds pretty great.  \nHe should appreciate that because you have the charisma (whatever combination of personality and looks you have) for this job and you are dating him.\n\nHe sounds like he does not know how lucky he is.\n\nGood luck", "Ditch the insecure loser. NTA", "Is he terrific in every single other aspect? Because telling you to lie is a giant red flag, imo. You've only dated him for 7 months. I can't imagine being ok with lying, or being asked to lie, about something so benign.", "Are you kidding!?\n\nI\u2019m a lawyer. Do you know how much I would fucking LOVE to meet someone and hear that they\u2019re a ducking princess?!", "Honestly I think this is a super cool career and he needs to get on board or GTFO.  I would think hard about how to transition out of this someday.  I bet your personas could be great audiobook readers, or YouTuber!", "NTA- Your job sounds effing amazing! What's wrong with your bf?! Ditch him, your majesty. Ditch him NOW!", "I would\u2018ve already clocked out of this relationship. And because I no longer wish to keep this relationship, I would throw his exact words back in his face.\n\n\u201cMy job is childish and not respectable? So then, why does it make me more money than yours does? What\u2019s that about, hm? \ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\u201d", "NTA. Break up with this guy.", "Nta\n\nBut rethinking dating someone who says they are embarrassed by you", "NTA, he is spouting elitist shit.", "NTA. There is nothing embarrassing about what you do and by the sounds of it you work hard and had the innovation to keep making money even during the pandemic. That to me is admirable. The fact your bf is embarrassed by that makes me think he is either extremely immature, a narcissist or a coward. I'd tell him this is his problem and you won't be lying.", "NTA.  But this man is not Prince Charming.  You're only 7 months in, cut your losses if he can't accept you as you are.", "NTA. Telling a lie like that about yourself is giving up who you truly are. You have a great job that makes people happy. Maybe he is the guy for you. Never give up you!", "This is basically the same as saying you are a Disney character at a theme park. Why is this a bad thing? Children and adults alike love this stuff! You get to do it in your own terms and make good cash too. NTA. But I know who is.", "NTA, but if he pushes it, promise to be vague. Then tell his family that you dress in \"femine attire\" and perform at parties. He will be begging you to clarify. Then, probably, dump his ass.", "NTA and you should consider if a dude who is embarrassed about you doing something you love (and that makes you good money) is really the person you want to spend your life with. If he's embarrassed about this, what other dumb shit is he going to be embarrassed about? \n\nDon't hide who you are and what you love. And don't be with someone who would ask you to do so.", "Nta, get a different boyfriend!", "I worked with a woman who also did this part-time.  She loved it.  She had 2 young sons and she enjoyed girl-time with all these little princesses.\n\nDon't lie to his family.  It will inevitably come out and then you will look weak and ashamed of yourself, which you are not.\n\nIF they ask, tell them, saying you're a surprised by  how great it has been financially and you love making little girls (and boys) very happy.\n\nYour BF is being massively insecure and controlling about this.  That's concerning, and something to watch out for in other issues.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t think he realizes how great it is to have a niche job that not many people can or would do.", "IKR, if I were introduced to her, I would be so intrigued and want to know all about it. It is so creative, so interesting and she's an entrepreneur.  I think the whole idea is absolutely fascinating.", "Don't forget she has to pretend to them that she doesn't make more money than he does, or he would be offended and embarrassed.\n\nETA. /s. \n\nNTA, OP.", "There's a great episode of the podcast Podcast: The Ride where they interview a woman who was a Disney princess and I believe did the princess parties as well. I think the episode is just called 'disney princesses', and it was absolutely fascinating.", "Personally if a family member brought you over and you told me your line of work, I\u2019d end up monopolizing your time and asking trillions of questions and wanting to see ALL the pictures \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f this sounds super interesting and would be SUCH a good conversation starter in my opinion, your bf seems kinda lame.", "Idk dude if my boyfriend was so ashamed of my work (regardless of what it was) he wanted me to LIE to his family, idk if I'd be interested in continuing that relationship. But you do you. You're certainly NTA.\n\nAlso what is his end game? If y'all stay together are you going to lie to his family forever? Lol has he thought this through?", "\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51", "Your work is part of who you are. And he wants to hide it, no, he is even ashamed of it. Why are you with someone who is ashamed of you? He thinks you play princess like a child, but the effort to put the custumes together, make-up, get ready for your role and act like the princess you were booked to. Also to interact with your customer is also challenging. It is hard, but great work. I would be so proud of you and tell everyone what you do. He also missed the chance to be the sidekick of your prince for some child-bookings. Maybe your next-bf...", "Lying it never a good idea. They\u2019d find out eventually if you guys stayed together for a while. Why is he so embarrassed? If he truly cared about you, he\u2018d support you and stand up for you if family took any issue with your job.", "I think she should talk up how lucrative it is.  Why not be proud of a rewarding job that pays really well?", "I think it's FANTASTIC that you've found something you're good at that pays your way. I would absolutely hire you to have a tea party with my kids if you were in the area - hell, if I throw myself a party for my next big number birthday I might hire you to be there just to hang out and throw back drinks in princess costume with us! \n\nSeriously you sound like you're a lot of fun. It's a shame your boyfriend is too hung up on things which don't matter half as much as he thinks they do. You have a creative mind, a positive disposition and a good work ethic. Anyone who's too hung up on 'princess costumes' to see past that ... I'd question their role in your life, because nobody's criticizing the lovely lads and lasses who do that job at Disney.\n\nNTA and if he won't be proud of you, I'll tell you flat out that I am, and I hope my kids grow up to be as creative and go-getting as you are!", "How did you get into this line of work?\n\nIt's something I'm absolutely interested in, but I'm wondering how I could start doing it (short of starting my own business)", "Sorry it wasn't clear. I was being sarcastic.", "I have a friend who does singing telegrams. He also has a catalogue of outfits and songs you can choose from or he will even help you write your own song. He gets lots of birthdays (kids and adults), but Valentine's is definitely his busiest day of the year. He said he's booked for almost 12 hours straight tomorrow bringing flowers and chocolates to people and serenading them while dressed as Cupid.", "That sounds like so much fun. The kids must love it. And they get a gift from their Princess!! Super sweet.", "Perfect response right here", "And then people can no longer be exploited, which is the point.", "Bot", "Maybe the BF is afraid of all the attention OP will get talking about her job.  I can't imagine anyone not thinking she's making kids happy and having fun--what a great job.  Could he be envious?"]}
