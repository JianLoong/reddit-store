I'm about to turn 40 and would love to just hang out with Belle and do temporary tatooes\ud83d\ude04 You have a really interesting, creative job, you should feel proud about that.", "That sounds amazing! I follow a bunch of party princesses on social media and all of you are so talented! Between the costumes, makeup and acting/singing...just wow!", "I used to work as a princess and superhero too. It was a blast and I've never gotten anything but positive responses from people I've told. Don't let him dull your shine.", "There's nothing that says you can't do both! I went to a party where the Cinderella was the owner of her princess company with multiple actors working for her.", "Okay. So, you\u2019re dressing up. I get it now. For what it\u2019s worth, it sounds like a pretty cool job.", "I did a couple of seasons working as an elf at a Christmas attraction (a full production thing, not just a grotto). It made me want to be a Disney princess, but getting a job at Disneyland is both hard and not in my country! I never considered just doing it by myself!", "Right, so, your boyfriend is embarrassed that you're an actress making children happy.\n\nThe question I'd have for you is: do you want to spend your life with somebody who is embarrassed by you, to the point of pressuring you to lie about yourself?", "I would have no problem with my SO being a \"party Princess\".  \n\nWould your BF be more accepting of your job if you told people that you are \"a self employed entrepreneur in the entertainment industry\" and that you provide \"in person and online characterizations of of fantasy characters for your clients\"?  Or, just simply, \"I am an actress.\"  It isn't a lie.  \n\nIs every other aspect of your relationship enough to offset his being ashamed of your job?  Your partner should be proud of you, not asking you to lie to support his ego.", "I was a party princess, it\u2019s an awesome job! I loved seeing their faces light up. It takes a lot more skill than most people realise. Yes, it has an expiry date but there are transferable skills you can use to move into another industry (or even remain in the party business but move behind scenes, toward planning). \n\nYou deserve someone who cares more about you. It sounds like he\u2019s ashamed of what you do and thinks it\u2019s childish. It isn\u2019t. Either talk to him and see if he is receptive. If not you deserve better than someone who wants you to lie to his family because he doesn\u2019t want them knowing about your job", "One of my friend's moms booked a Cinderella party when we were all in our mid 20s, plus all the mom's friends too lol. It's never too late! Our Cinderella was actually the owner of her princess company so she had tons of interesting stories about it, along with the singalong and whatever. It was a very Extra day but fun.", "Uh\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t recommend that, makes it sound like she\u2019s sanitizing her job being OnlyFans fetish work. Being a Party Princess sounds a lot more interesting to me!", "Nah, a vibrator or a dildo that size would deliver the same satisfaction without the inconvenience of an attached asshole \ud83d\ude01", "Nothing screams \"I don't know what women like\" more than people obsessed with dick length as a measure. As if any women is excited to fuck some pencil dick because it's 7in long.\n\nY'all have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.", "That's why I would recommend it, along with \"my boyfriend is uncomfortable when I talk about this\".", "That sounds amazing! I follow a bunch of party princesses on social media and all of you are so talented!", "I know that girth is just as important", "Evil. I love it.", "Roflmao."]}
