Could you have been more gentle?", "YTA\n\nInitially, I was totally on your side because if it is getting to the point of being sexually harassed and she can't do anything - it's a problem.\n\nBut you're mad she's training unpaid? Have you heard of trial runs, unpaid internships? A single day of training without getting paid is not that serious, and you suggesting she leave early to hang out on her TRAINING day is ridiculous. What sort of standard is she setting by not even taking the first day seriously? \n\nYou say people are controlling but you seem to think YOU should get to decide what she does", "INFO\n\nHave you talked to her before about this? Not just out of exasperation, but a proper adult conversation?\n\nSeems she could use assertiveness training with a therapist. Some people are just more passive than others. \n\nHowever, insulting her is probably not the most constructive way of dealing with it. An honest talk with her would probably be better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Cause if she\u2019s happy to help I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s your place to call her a push over. \n\nI\u2019m leaning toward YTA because starting a fight with your girlfriend due to her own abuse is unnecessary and counterproductive. There\u2019s better more effective ways to voice your concerns to her other than insulting her. Unpaid training days aren\u2019t unusual. I\u2019d wait until she actually starts working to make a judgment. \nBut maybe I\u2019m off base here idk", "YTA - Ugghhh. Life would be so much easier if she'd just do what you say.", "You say people take advantage of her and treat her badly and then go forward and... Yell at her.\n\nYTA, find a better way to communicate, and if she shares your outlook on the people surrounding her, encourage her to speak up. Don't start a fight.", ">Girlfriend Gets Abused by Everyone and does Nothing About it.  \n>  \n>Am I the asshole for calling her a pushover and basically starting a fight?\n\nYTA. \"Everyone\" is abusing her and now you are too.", "You're right, I could have been more gentle.", "What he's describing (an unpaid \"trial\" day) is actually illegal in the US.\n\nIt does sound like she has boundary issues, but I'm not sure how OP expects her to overcome that from him picking fights with over it.", "I get that I was wrong in the insulting part. It's just been a long time issue with her not being able to say no to anyone.\nEven with me in the beginning of the relationship I had to be careful when suggesting dates and activities because she would just agree without wanting that specific thing, I would always have to double check if she really wanted to. And other people use that to take advantage of her.", "No she does the favours and then calls me to complain that people keep asking her for them.\n\nHere unpaid training days are extremely unusual, most you get is a few hours but even that is often sketchy, specially without a contract. Considering that after lunch she opened the store by herself without any documents, no insurance no contract nothing.", "Mostly for her, she keeps complaining that people treat her bad and take advantage of her and then when time comes to set boundaries she never does, with anyone.", "I didn't yell at her. We where texting.", "I don't know if he's in the US but even if they are, like damn, 1 day? Is it that deep? For a potentially long-term paying job? Especially because it is training, not an interview - which suggests she's highly likely to secure the job. I get that time is valuable but if you can't sacrifice 10 hours ONCE, for a job, I'd get an employer not really wanting to hire you. Obviously if she's expected to work for free in future that's a problem, but it doesn't sound like that.", "Except you.", "Sorry, I wasn't being literal. I meant it as starting a fight.", "I have had many training days and they are always paid, it's illegal and unethical where I live. Time is money and you are basically working for free for a full day, that's a lot of money.", "Oh ok sorry.\nI see your point then.", "I get it is illegal and unethical in some places, but personally I would prefer to get a job than to hold the higher moral ground and potentially struggle to find a new job. I've done free training days and always gotten the job, and have literally never been asked to work extra hours/days for free once employed. \n\nI hear your mentality but I can't understand valuing pay for a single day over a secure job. Like you'd choose getting 0 for the month over losing one day's pay? Doesn't make sense to me", "I get it if someone is struggling.\nBut she's not, this job is basically to get some extra money while finishing her master's degree. \n\nIt's about setting boundaries and limits, and to note she opened the store alone after lunch for a few hours, without contract or insurance. And now is basically there in the back office doing nothing waiting for the closing time to learn how to close the store.", "And when she gets the job she'll get paid. One day free is not indicative of the culture going forward. If she's so secure she can quit if they try to not pay her once she has the job. \n\nPeople can set boundaries but its important to pick your battles. At the end of the day, I'd rather not send out my cv and go for interviews a couple more times for who knows how long when I have a job lined up"]}
