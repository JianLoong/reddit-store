I was the only safe option, to put it lightly, so I told them they could stay here temporarily. I laid out ground rules, knowing how Austin is (incredibly lazy). Austin was to keep working full time and never miss a day unless sick. When he was home he was to do his fair share of house work. I told them they didn't have to pay rent so they will be helping in other ways. My sister works for me in my business and she can bring my niece with her. I help watch her throughout the day. \n\nI have the house stuff split equally and on a rotating schedule. So like we all cook dinner in a rotation of me, Hannah and then Austin, repeat. Cleaning the bathroom, same rotation. Etc, etc. There's not many chores. Just dinner, dishes and bathroom. Well, lately Austin has been a little prick, to put it lightly. Starts getting really pissed having to do anything when he gets home from work (6hrs- 4 days a week at a Sub Sandwich shop). If he is making dinner that night he almost always starts yelling to my sister and saying \"Hannah will you just come fucking do this? I need to walk away.\" And then he will go outside and smoke for a half hour and just have my sister do his chore. I started putting my foot down because this guy won't even hold his kid so my sister can eat or bathe. When he does take his child he will put her on the floor in front of him and leave her crying while he plays video games. I've had enough. \n\nSo yesterday he pulled the same shit. Tried getting out of dinner by yelling to my sister to do it. I immediately stepped in and said no. If he was going to be here he wasn't going to be using the \"I can't do this\" weaponized incompetent bullshit. He can do it. He's simply lazy. I told him it ends now. He's going to be doing his chores. He is going to be helping out with his kid OR he was going to start paying me the full rent of what a room would be in the area ($650) if he wants to stay here. Later on he told my sister he was moving out because I was a dumb bitch and treated him like a child and got her all worked up so she's panicking and asking me to understand that he's just \"burnt out\". AITA?\n\nETA: my sister does NOT want to do his chores. They end up getting in to yelling matches over it damn near every time.

You imply that Austin is a BF, not your sister\u2019s husband, therefore, you are under no obligation to house and provide for him (there is some obligation-however you see fit-with your sister & niece as they are family). The 3 of them also don\u2019t come as a unit, so yes, you can have a set of requirements that he has to fulfill in order to live there. If he doesn\u2019t meet those requirements, you can kick him out.

She is modeling that he doesn't have to do anything or pay for anything and it is a perfectly reasonable expectation that he is a leach, so the minute she is old enough to clean up after him, he will expect her to do so. The moment she starts making money, he will ask her to cover for him. Does she want him leaching off her daughter for the rest of his life? \n\nShe would be giving her daughter a better life if he was actually paying child support b/c having him in the home is no benefit to her child if he isn't eeven willing to hold her so mom can take a shower.", "Children emulate what we do, not what we say. If she stays in a crap relationship, her daughter is likely to do the same, if she puts up with crap, her daughter is likely to do the same. \n\nSure, some people break the pattern, but those are the stories that everyone talk about because it's hard and it's rare.\n\nAsk her if she wants her daughter to have a relationship like her own when she grows up, if her answer is yes, she should stay, if it's no, she should go.\n\nI grew up in a so-called broken home (ie my parents divorced), I've done well in life, had to divorce a weak man along the way, but I figured out my patterns and am now in a very healthy relationship.", "I've got news for your sister. Her kid is already in a broken home", "A broken home can have 2 meanings.\n\n1. Mom and dad (mom & mom, dad & dad) are no longer together.\n2. Mom and dad no longer get along, and there is constant bickering in the house. The house no longer seems like a safe space for the majority of the people that live there \n\nIn my opinion, #2 can cause more damage to a child than #1. Your sister needs to realize this. Children can still thrive without both their parents being together under 1 roof. It is much more difficult for a child to thrive if there is constant conflict in the home. Children will often pick up the negative behaviors, and this will cause them to repeat the cycle into adulthood. Does your sister really want your niece to end up in a relationship like her parents? Or does she want better for her? If your sister wants better for her daughter, then your sister needs to do better for herself.", "So seeing that dad doesn't care about her even when she's crying and Dad screaming at Mom is better for her? Your sister needs to understand that this relationship is broken because of his actions and raising a child in a broken relationship teaches them to accept a broken relationship for themselves in the future. \n\nMy niece at age 18 told me that she just found out that all dads don't drink beer first thing in the morning. She just realized that all dads don't go through several cases of beer a week. She grew up like that and so she thought that was normal! And you don't want your niece growing up to think this kind of relationship dynamic is normal. She needs to step back and rethink that idea. Some therapy would help.\n\nEdit Typo", "Her daughter wouldn\u2019t grow up in a broken home though. She would be raised by two sisters who love her and each other dearly and see support and care her whole life. Even if she moves out eventually I can\u2019t imagine a world in which y\u2019all would drift apart. Unless she doubles down with Austin maybe.", "as long as HE doesn't do anything a father and partner should do, it is a broken home.  \n\n\nSounds to me he is desperatly clinging on the teenage years and wanting to have no responsibility at all.", "Point out to her that her daughter is absolutely going to grow up in a broken home if she stays with this loser and he doesn't shape up. Her daughter will grow up with a lazy, uninvolved father who doesn't care about her or her mother. Is having a shitty father and a miserable mom really better than having no father and a happier mom?", "It is so much better to grow up in a broken home than in a home with a jerk for a parent. Please relay this to your sister as myself and other commenters have said. You can't use a child like glue.", "A broken home is better than showing her daughter that she should allow those who claim to love her abuse her on the regular and justify it to herself that its better than X reason....", "\"Broken home\" is a misnomer and she needs to know that FAST. Growing up with your parents still married doesn't mean shit if they're constantly bickering because one of them can't get their shit together enough to keep them off the streets. This guy offers 0 and your sister is acting like he's the one keeping the family all together and afloat. Wtf.", "She had a kid with him I suppose that makes her TA.
