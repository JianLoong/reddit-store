They have a 1yo daughter together. Family emergencies came up 3 months ago and they needed somewhere to stay. I was the only safe option, to put it lightly, so I told them they could stay here temporarily. I laid out ground rules, knowing how Austin is (incredibly lazy). Austin was to keep working full time and never miss a day unless sick. When he was home he was to do his fair share of house work. I told them they didn't have to pay rent so they will be helping in other ways. My sister works for me in my business and she can bring my niece with her. I help watch her throughout the day. \n\nI have the house stuff split equally and on a rotating schedule. So like we all cook dinner in a rotation of me, Hannah and then Austin, repeat. Cleaning the bathroom, same rotation. Etc, etc. There's not many chores. Just dinner, dishes and bathroom. Well, lately Austin has been a little prick, to put it lightly. Starts getting really pissed having to do anything when he gets home from work (6hrs- 4 days a week at a Sub Sandwich shop). If he is making dinner that night he almost always starts yelling to my sister and saying \"Hannah will you just come fucking do this? I need to walk away.\" And then he will go outside and smoke for a half hour and just have my sister do his chore. I started putting my foot down because this guy won't even hold his kid so my sister can eat or bathe. When he does take his child he will put her on the floor in front of him and leave her crying while he plays video games. I've had enough. \n\nSo yesterday he pulled the same shit. Tried getting out of dinner by yelling to my sister to do it. I immediately stepped in and said no. If he was going to be here he wasn't going to be using the \"I can't do this\" weaponized incompetent bullshit. He can do it. He's simply lazy. I told him it ends now. He's going to be doing his chores. He is going to be helping out with his kid OR he was going to start paying me the full rent of what a room would be in the area ($650) if he wants to stay here. Later on he told my sister he was moving out because I was a dumb bitch and treated him like a child and got her all worked up so she's panicking and asking me to understand that he's just \"burnt out\". AITA?\n\nETA: my sister does NOT want to do his chores. They end up getting in to yelling matches over it damn near every time. Same with the fact that he won't even hold his kid so she can eat or bathe. It's a constant fight, so yes it is my business.", "created_utc": 1675432348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10skthj/aita_for_speaking_to_my_sisters_bf_like_hes_a/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can't live rent free and act like a child in someone's home, you gotta pick one.", "Wow NTA.\n\nHe should be bending over backwards to pay you back for your generosity, you\u2019re literally housing his family for free during a tough time.\n\nHe\u2019s also being openly abusive to the mother of his child and his child in your home. \n\nHopefully he leaves and is able to reflect on his behaviour.", "Nta \nHe needs to grow up \nAnd contribute if he isn\u2019t paying rent", "NTA.

Consequences can suck, but they exist and now he is in the find out stage.\n\nRegarding their relationship, loving your sister and niece is wonderful, but doesn\u2019t extend to managing her relationship for her - she needs to learn herself. And if she is unwilling to do anything about the fact that he refuses to pull his weight that is on her.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make it easier to have their drama in your space though, but if you don\u2019t like him you have to accept she may go too. Just be sure to be a support if she does leave him (& from your description my fingers are crossed for that!)", "NTA - I also don't understand why he doesn't just bring sub sandwiches home for his dinner contributions? He's already there and should be able to just buy them at the end of his shift (maybe with an employee discount?) and voila, dinner.

You made sure you\u2019re not going to be a doormat, and you were advocating for your sister by putting a stop to this weaponized incompetence by her supposed partner in life.\n\nThis happens a lot and I hate it. I can only wish your sister would see that you\u2019re making the tough call for everybody\u2019s sake. We should really stop making excuses for our partner\u2019s awful behavior.", "NTA. Your sister needs to take a hard look at that relationship. Just because she is in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a broken one. Stand your ground and treat him like the child he is a he grows up.", "NTA.\n\nThe house rules are fair. It's not like they're being exploited or anything.\n\nThe relationship is probably a mess.

It must be heartbreaking to see your sister settle for this.", "NTA  you established rules and told him the expectations if he can't behave like an adult it's on him. Hold your ground and please don't let him get away with being lazy and disrespectful to your sister. To me it sounds like he dead weight and she's better off staying with you and getting her life settled. If she can If possible go to the courts to get full custody and at the very least get child support. Still it's really sad he's so immature and selfish instead of contributing towards his daughter. If your sister would stay with him and his behavior doesn't improve it would be a bad example for their daughter.", "Why can't people use birth control? NTA", "NTA because it is your house; that makes it your business when there\u2019s constant yelling and messiness. If he can\u2019t abide by house rules (and free rent no less), he can leave.", "Edited for clarity:\n\nNTA-due to one technicality. You imply that Austin is a BF, not your sister\u2019s husband, therefore, you are under no obligation to house and provide for him (there is some obligation-however you see fit-with your sister & niece as they are family). The 3 of them also don\u2019t come as a unit, so yes, you can have a set of requirements that he has to fulfill in order to live there. If he doesn\u2019t meet those requirements, you can kick him out. Taking with him directly is treating him like the \u201ctenant\u201d that he is, and if he\u2019s not holding his end of the bargain, you have a right to tell him to leave your home. \n\nIF he was the husband or even decidedly living together (this arrangement doesn\u2019t count), I would say that you\u2019d be the AH, because then you can\u2019t meddle in their (abusive-leaning) relationship except to discuss it directly with your sister. \n\nPersonally, you don\u2019t mention who else lives there, but I wouldn\u2019t want his daughter or any other minors seeing his abusive behavior, so I say good riddance. Glad he\u2019s moving out-help him get out faster by just packing up his stuff, and be sure you give him a get-out-by date. Hopefully, your sister will come to her senses and not follow suit.", "Behave like a child, get spoken to like a child. These situations always make me a little sad though, why do they have a kid so young if they (especially him) are not ready to deal with it? When I was 20 I was also a young lazy kid who couldn't hold up his own pants, but he obviously has responsibilities and needs to step up his game. Good that at least someone is trying to force him to grow up, NTA.", "NTA.", "They're both still children who stupidly had a kid NTA but the boyfriend and the sibling both are", "NTA, it sounds like you have your sister and nieces best interest in mind. Make sure she understands that even if he leaves, she is more than welcome to stay. You might be the saving grace to get her and her child out of that situation before it\u2019s too late.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Parents staying together for their kids usually does more damage to them in the long run, especially when one parent  - like the father in this post - is clearly not emotionally mature enough to be acting like an adult, let alone raising a whole kid.

I hated growing up watching my mom be a single mother even tho my dad ( her husband ) was in the other room playing video games or sleep. I resented tf outta my dad for that shit. Sit down and have a conversation with your sister and let her know that this will only will get worse. Ask her if she really wants to be be a married single mom just to save her daughter from growing up in a broken home.", "It might be worth mentioning that homes can be broken whether the parents are together or not. Is she open to therapy to explore why she feels parents \"need\" to be together?

I read she doesn\u2019t want a baby in a broken home, I get that but imo it\u2019s already broken. That kid being away from that behaviour will be far better than living with a dad who is mentally unavailable and treats the mom like trash. The guy has zero drive to better his career and life for the sake of his family and will likely take another 10 years to grow up.

OP is well within their rights to say \u201cBF you\u2019re not doing what was agreed upon, in terms of cooking/cleaning, so shape up or ship out\u201d, but division of child care wasn\u2019t part of the deal and is between the two of them. (Before anyone gets angry, the BF is also being a completely shit father and partner too, not excusing his atrocious behavior)."]}
