I suspect that they thought you were the same as them, and that you were jealous of them for having such nice automobiles. Then, when they asked you about your house, you made them look foolish and superficial, not to mention thin- skinned. Apparently, they can dish it out but they can't take it. In addition, not only did you fail to feel jealous of their pretty cars, but you got something better for yourself with your wiser financial judgment.
