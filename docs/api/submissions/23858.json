I think both tried to keep me away from that. But my mom has a very explosive personality and she likes to get her way. So it can be hard for anyone to keep conflict with her hidden if you're around them. She and I have fought a lot since I was 6 over different things where she feels likes he doesn't ever have to take anyone else's feelings or opinions into account and both my aunts are no longer talking to her because of how difficult she is.\n\nWhen I was 4 my mom got remarried and had my half brother. My mom's husband is a lazy ass. I don't ever remember him having a job. He was never very involved in being a dad to his kid. He used to say shit to get a reaction out of me when I was young. Like how my dad should give them extra money since they had a kid together and he could help pay for him. Over time my mom and her husband started taking clothes my dad would buy me and saving them for my half brother, sometimes even having him wear stuff that was way too big. They also stole school supplies and toys. I used to complain to my dad about it. Especially when the clothes they'd get were all good will clothes that looked bad. My mom blew a gasket when my dad told her it was a problem. First it was with him, which I witnessed. Then it was to me when I got back to her house. She asked me how I could complain about making sure my brother had clothes and toys.\n\nEventually my dad started buying me two sets of clothes. Stuff I kept at his house, and very basic, thrifted clothes that were nothing special and would not be as appealing to take. After a few weeks of that and never bringing toys or school supplies to her house, she got super pissed off and tried to sue my dad in court over it. She was laughed out of court and told he was not obligated to give her stuff for my half brother.\n\nMy half brother really resented the times he would see me on my dad's weeks, wearing nice clothes and having all this stuff, while he was eventually put in the rags they had for me. Now we're 13 and 17 and he has been a little ass about it lately. He told me he hates my dad and he yelled at my dad for not giving him my old clothes when I have nice stuff. He told me his friends divorced parents would never do what my dad did. That they'd take care of their kids half siblings and not let them go around embarrassed like he has to. I told him that's great for them but it's not my dad's job to make sure he's taken care of.\n\nHe started yelling that nobody gives a shit about him and that we should all fuck off. He said I was shitty for not caring if he's taken care of and for not wanting my dad to make sure he's taken care of. He said I should be a better brother than that when I at least have one good parent. He has none.

This really set him off and maybe I'm an ass for saying it because I have had a much better life than him. My dad is rational and takes care of me but mom kinda sucks honestly and his dad has clearly never given a shit or done good by him. I also didn't ask dad to give him the clothes out of care for him. I always kinda hated that it happened and never regretted having dad make sure it stopped.

He also keeps repeating that no one cares about him since he\u2019s aware his own dad doesn\u2019t and neither does his mom. He\u2019s gonna need a lot of therapy when he gets older.

His parents are the A-Hs here, refusing to step up and properly provide for him. He's only 13, and sees his sibling has material things that are a lot better than what he has.

I think your dad is handling this perfectly, and when it comes to your nice stuff, you are too as long as you\u2019re not bragging about it.\n\nI have to wonder, though\u2026 how is your relationship with your brother otherwise? Sometimes we feel like people should know that gifts don\u2019t equal love, but sometimes they need to be told outright. He may resent your dad because at one point he hoped he\u2019d found a man to look up to and was disappointed when that guy seemed to reject him. Could you be that strong role model for him in ways that don\u2019t involve money? Do you guys ever do fun stuff together? Sports, video games, chats over ice cream, etc.? Is there anything he\u2019ll need to start learning that you could teach him? Shaving, math stuff, etc.? I think this kid is lashing out because he\u2019s feeling unloved and the stuff is just a symbol. Make sure he knows you love him and his resentment about the clothes might fade.", "NTA but your mom is an ahole on a whole different level.\n\nMy parents stayed together until our 20s (they were awful together and never should have gotten married), but they were cheap as anything and my siblings and I were always super embarrassed about our clothes. As the oldest, when I started working part-time (as a teen) I would buy nicer clothes for my sister as gifts sometimes. She cherished those sweaters and t-shirts and was really grateful. I later was bartending during uni as I put myself through school and I remember one weekend was really good for tips and I bought her a couple full outfits. She was over the moon. (My parents were better at clothing our younger brother thankfully).\n\nIt's not your responsibility to clothe him of course and I am not saying get a part time job to pick up where your mother is failing. But getting your brother something thoughtful for birthdays and Christmas, or the odd just because would probably mean a lot to him and really strengthen your relationship. Maybe you could save allowance for a birthday gift or your dad could help you for special occasions for your brother until you work one day. You'll want to build your own relationship with him separately from your mom and useless stepdad. He deserves your love as a brother. Even a nice tshirt would probably mean a lot to him.\n\nMy sister and I are super close having gone through a rough childhood together and being each other's support. I am happy to have been in a position where I was able to help her because I love her and she appreciated it. Just food for thought. He probably just feels really alone and unworthy. I feel for him. And for you, there's probably guilt on your end that you are provided for and he isn't. \n\nAgain, your mom is the worst for not making your stepdad man up and do his share of providing for him.", "NTA but your half brother isn\u2019t either. Unfortunately he got stuck with two completely useless parents. It certainly isn\u2019t your dad\u2019s responsibility but i do feel sorry for the poor kid. i don\u2019t think the clothes matter so much as it would be nice if he had one person in his life that gave a shit.", "INFO: what happens to your old clothing?

It\u2019s not your dad\u2019s responsibility to provide for your sibling and if your brother\u2019s not the nicest to you then you don\u2019t have any incentive to go out of your way to help him. It really comes back to his dad should be contributing more. I do feel sorry for the kid though, it sounds like he has really sucky parents and it would be really nice if he at least got the hand me downs of the better clothes once you\u2019re done with them. Not that your dad has to, just that it would be the nice thing to do. I can relate to not having the best relationship with a sibling but in this case it sounds like that\u2019s a result of your mum and step dad making things suck at home and not actually your brothers fault. You\u2019ve had to keep your things at your dads house to protect them from your mum not your brother. Poor kid is getting crapped on from all angles, no wonder he feels bitter about his situation. Perhaps you 2 could still have a good relationship despite the crappy parents and you could help him out, be better than the parents raising you both.", "I said nothing about the dad stepping up for the brother? I suggested the OP could. Are you talking about the part where the kid might have latched onto the OP\u2019s dad as a role model? That\u2019s something that kids do with adults all the time. The adult is never obligated to perform that role and would sometimes confuse the kid if they did, however that still often results in the types of resentment seen here. I\u2019m just offering a suggestion about why the poor kid is acting out.", "Yes, sorry that's what I meant....\nAnd I do feel sorry for the half, but that OP isn't responsible for him, abs his feels that's his crappy parents job, and it really only sounds like the kid wants material things, not brotherly love.
