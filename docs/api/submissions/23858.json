Is there anything he\u2019ll need to start learning that you could teach him? Shaving, math stuff, etc.?

As the oldest, when I started working part-time (as a teen) I would buy nicer clothes for my sister as gifts sometimes. She cherished those sweaters and t-shirts and was really grateful. I later was bartending during uni as I put myself through school and I remember one weekend was really good for tips and I bought her a couple full outfits. She was over the moon.

But getting your brother something thoughtful for birthdays and Christmas, or the odd just because would probably mean a lot to him and really strengthen your relationship. Maybe you could save allowance for a birthday gift or your dad could help you for special occasions for your brother until you work one day. You'll want to build your own relationship with him separately from your mom and useless stepdad. He deserves your love as a brother. Even a nice tshirt would probably mean a lot to him.\n\nMy sister and I are super close having gone through a rough childhood together and being each other's support. I am happy to have been in a position where I was able to help her because I love her and she appreciated it. Just food for thought. He probably just feels really alone and unworthy. I feel for him.

Not that your dad has to, just that it would be the nice thing to do. I can relate to not having the best relationship with a sibling but in this case it sounds like that\u2019s a result of your mum and step dad making things suck at home and not actually your brothers fault. You\u2019ve had to keep your things at your dads house to protect them from your mum not your brother. Poor kid is getting crapped on from all angles, no wonder he feels bitter about his situation.

Your half-brother is correct that is quite shitty that dont care to see someone else struggle to have a fraction of what everyone else has and the inevitable bullying and isolation that usually happens as a result. For example when you do outgrow clothes or shoes what do you do with those items, are they thrown away or donated? Also there are so many posts on SM on how to look stylish using thrifted/second hand items  that you could help your half-brother navigate.

You\u2019re also completely disregarding the fact that the relationship or lack there of between the brothers is that which has been fostered by the mother and her husband.", "Yeah like.. OPs dad isn't an AH, but OP kinda is just for their attitude toward their brother who is clearly struggling. \n\nAnd I wanna know what happened to the \"nice\" clothes when OP outgrew them. Handing them down would have been a kind thing to do, and doesnt negatively impact OP or their Dad . \n\nThe shitty attitude toward thrifted clothes is also offputting. I shop goodwill/thrift stores on purpose because why not? Cheaper and better for the environment, and you can go shop a \"real\" store for stuff you cant find thrifting. My kids LOVE thrift store trips", "No the mom and step dad's are AHs. NTA is correct.", "There's 4 parties to consider in this scenario. One party is absolutely the AH.", "How about both of them adult up and provide for their son?", "Parents usually help to facilitate sibling bonds. They're not usually magical things that occur instantaneously, and never need help or tending ever again; maintained in perfect harmony forever.\n\nGiven the mother and husband, who precisely would have been capable of promoting a healthy relationship between the boys (especially given that said adults do not actually know what a healthy relationship *is*?)?\n\nUnfortunately, as both the eldest AND the one who's had access to a stable parent, and therefore has way better mental/emotional health, that means OP is the only one equipped to reach out.\n\nI hesitate at putting that on a 17yo, because the older we get the more we realise how young 17 really is. But compared to 13, and especially compared to abused/neglected 13, 17 is light years ahead.\n\nAlso no one said OP should become his brother's new guardian. But perhaps having some compassion for him, as another literal VICTIM in this situation, wouldn't hurt.", "He\u2019s your brother and he needs help because his parents are AHs. Why not be the better person and just let him have your leftovers?", "According to OP\u2019s comments they went to his cousins. It makes sense his dad would rather help the kids of his sibling(s) over the kid of his entitled to ex.", "Are you considering OP\u2019s mother and stepfather as one party? Because those two are both assholes.", "Obviously they both suck. I was just pointing out the complete sexism in this to expect the man to \"provide.\"", "That was implied. Of course they both should. And his mom is the biggest ahole for not doing something rather than harass her ex to provide.", ">that means OP is the only one equipped to reach out\n\nWhy? They have no bond. One more year and op wouldn't have to see these people ever again. Just bevause they share some dna doesn't make them a faaamily. Why would he make his life worse by dealing with his brother?? He said he doesn't like being around his brother. I'd say a clean cut is better, that way he can move on with his life.", "It sounds like dad gives them to his cousin. Op can\u2019t make his dad give them to him. And after mom took dad to court I don\u2019t think he is inclined to help.", "Why is the entitled half brother more deserving of the clothes than OP\u2019s cousins?", "Ok, that's fair. I still think OP lacks even basic compassion for their brother, when it's the mom/step dad that are the problem, and it would be good to unpack that.", "yes.", "Why are the cousins more deserving?  He\u2019s a young kid. He\u2019s the half brother. He has no one in his corner.  Good grief.", "You really can\u2019t see how a 17 year old would have compassion fatigue towards a half sibling who is being an asshole towards him and his father?", "This person tries to come off empathetic yet can't understand why OP is feeling this way and invalidating him", "NTA can you ask your dad if you can be there full time.\n\nSucks to be tour brother but that\u2019s not a you problem", "Nta. It is NOT your dad's job to look after how many kids his exes decide to have.", "You are correct.\n\nIt is not your father's place to care for your half brother.\n\nUnfortunately, your half brother didn't get the parents he wanted and he is stuck with what he has.\n\nHe think you won the lottery with your father, and perhaps you did.  He is jealous and at age 13, still a kid.  he doesn't understand\n\nAs you graduate an high school  and hopefully pursue higher education, you may need to go NC with your mom, and her family.  \n\nClearly NTA", "NTA. He needs therapy to vent out his frustrations. \ud83d\ude02", "How about informing him what his parents did to you for him? It's their fault they treated you like s\\*\\*\\* and now he feels entitled. They blew that bridge long ago. NTA.", "NTA. His parents are but no you or your dad. Honestly you should just move in with your dad. You\u2019re almost 18 and if you mom tried to take your dad to court over that she\u2019d be laughed at as well. As far as the courts are concerned your pretty much an adult and make decisions. Most courts let kids decide at 13 who they want to live with. What is your mom gonna do when child support stops? Definitely NTA.", "He also keeps repeating that no one cares about him since he\u2019s aware his own dad doesn\u2019t and neither does his mom.", ">Question\u2026 What happens to the good clothes when you outgrow the\n\nWhat does that matter?!?", "What does that matter?!?", "NGL, I really can't stand the whole \"at childhood age X, Billy should know better or know how to behave.\"  In regards to minor children dealing with complicated toxic family situations.", "Because if dad is throwing them out to spite his ex that would be an AH move.", "Biologically but it\u2019s still his brother.", "None of anyone's business what he does with anything he pays for, you make no sense and are grasping at straws to be negative", "Whatever he chooses to do with the clothes he purchased is fine. It\u2019s not spiteful to not give the clothes to his ex\u2019s other kid.", "Half brother", "What ridiculous questions and none of your business. This has nothing to do with anything.", "It\u2019s not that OP is expected to know to show kindness to his half brother who is 13 and being a jerk. We are just suggesting that he can choose to show kindness even if he doesn\u2019t have to. That\u2019s called modeling good behavior for a young half brother who could use a decent human being to look up to.  Geez. Have a heart.", "The person we're talking about said OP lacked \"basic empathy\", but given the scenario, I'd say OP is under pressure himself and he's young.
