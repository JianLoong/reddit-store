It was cancer. \n\nHe had two kids from a past marriage who were in their early teens when he married me. I had a 7 year old from an earlier relationship as well. We didn't have anymore kids. \n\nI tried to treat my step children as my own but they never accepted me. They were very rude and insulted me whenever they could. Since I did not work they called me a gold digger who married their dad only for his money. \n\nThe truth was my grandparents were quite wealthy and left me a lot of money when they died. I lived well below my means and chose to stay home and raise my daughter, since I could afford that. I did not need his money at all. But I didn't bother sharing this with his kids and told him not to either. I did not want them to like me just because they might gain monetarily from me. \n\nMy husband on the other hand hated how they behaved with me. Their blatant disrespect made him not pay for their College tuition. Their mom couldn't pay for it and they had to take loans for it. They didn't even talk to him. \n\nEven when he got cancer, they refused to come see him. For three years we struggled with the treatment. My daughter came to visit from time to time, when she could. \n\nDuring this time only person who really helped both of us was someone we were not related to at all. This girl in her late 20s waitressed at a cafe we frequented. She was a single mom, taking classes at community college at night, working during day and raising her two kids. She took a liking to us and when she learned my husband was sick, spend whatever time she could visiting him. She has stayed nights at the hospital when I needed a break and basically been the daughter we wished for. \n\nWhen he died, she helped me arrange the funeral. His kids came on the day and all they wanted to know was about their inheritance. I felt sick. \n\nWhen I learned my husband has left his estate to me, (whatever is left after settling his bills, and it was around $25000), I decided to give it to the girl who helped us both so much. She tried to refuse but I insisted she take it. She needed it and in my opinion deserved it more than the ungrateful children. \n\nMy daughter understands why I did not give it to his children but is upset I did not give anything to her either. I told her she already had money and a job. Not to mention she will get my inheritance. This was in no way her money. \n\nBut his ex wife and kids are causing havoc over this and really upset with me. They are calling me AH for giving away money they deserve. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695383824, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16p8dfk/aita_for_giving_my_late_husbands_estate_to_a/", "score": 774, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They want the money. There is a difference. I just went no contact with my parents (literally 2-3 days ago). I know the odds are they will cut me out of their will. I\u2019m 100% ok with it. Being free of their toxicity is 100% worth giving up what money they may give me. In all honesty\u2026I don\u2019t know how I will feel if they do leave me money in their will. Do I even want to accept it? I honestly don\u2019t know. Taking the money won\u2019t fix the damage they caused. His adult children made choices in life. But now that he\u2019s gone. Now that all of it is said and done. Now that they are demanding money\u2026I would look at them and say \u201caren\u2019t you quite the gold diggers. You know your dad never funded things for me. I was wealthy on my own. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t work. I didn\u2019t need the money.\u201d", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, an estate of 25k is very small.  It\u2019s not the size of an estate that people even normally ask about or fight over.   It\u2019s surprising to me that your child and your step children were expecting some windfall when your husbands total net worth was 25k.  Were they under the impression that your husband had money?\n\nIf your husband wanted his kids or your kids to have his estate, he would have left it to them.   But he wanted you to have it, and you were well within your right and the moral high ground to gift it to someone who made an influence in your life and for whom it may be a life changing gift.", "NTA.  $25K might make all the difference to a single mom working a waitressing job, but it's not going to change the life of already well off kids, particularly split all those ways.", "Well, the bottom line is that he wrote the will. They can be angry with him not you for that.", "Step-kids, NTA. Seems like that waitress was more family by choice than those awful step-kids were by blood. Sounds like they were the true gold diggers. \n\nINFO - did he leave anything non-monetary for your daughter? Are you supporting her in other ways? You mentioned living well below your means, how comfortable is she? \n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\n>But his ex wife and kids are causing havoc over this and really upset with me. They are calling me AH for giving away money they deserve. \n\nIf they deserved it, he would've stated that in his will\n\n>She was a single mom, taking classes at community college at night, working during day and raising her two kids.\n\nAll this and still\n\n>She has stayed nights at the hospital when I needed a break\n\nWho looked after this single mothers kids while she was keeping a complete stranger company???", "I think you and your husband didn't do a great job of integrating families, and then blamed his kids for not accepting you. It sounds like they probably parroted what they heard elsewhere, and he and you did nothing to make that better. His relationship with them sounds very transactional - he refused to pay for college because he was angry, they pulled back. I'm not saying he should have ignored it, but your description of his kids as money grubbing while not seeing your own daughter that way despite her argument that she should have gotten his money gives a negative picture of your attitude towards them. So while you're NTA for giving money to the young woman who supported you both, I do think your husband are to blame for this family dynamic in the first place.", "NTA. An inheritance is only ever a gift. It's not to be expected, and it is not 'deserved'.  Had your husband died deeply in debt -would his kids have come forward to help pay it? No.  Regardless of what they, or anyone else thinks - you did a beautiful thing for someone who truly was more needful and 'deserving'.  As for your daughter - perhaps she didn't 'need' it, and yes, she will one day inherit from you - but right now you just showered one 'child' with love, generosity, goodwill, kindness and money and left your actual child standing out in the cold, feeling left out, disregarded and replaced. It hurts when your own mother essentially favors someone else more - the logic of 'why' does not overcome the feelings of abandonment.", "NTA You were the beneficiary of the will and you can do what you want with the money. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss, you sound like a lovely person.", "There\u2019s no way I can go N T A here.

Like how did the OP and the husband get together.\n\nThe behaviour of the husband's children sounds like how children would reject a mistress and a father who cheated on their mother. I know this from rejecting my dad's mistress when he left my mum for her.", "NTA. If your daughter was helpful during your husband's illness, I can see why she'd be annoyed that you showed appreciation to the waitress but not her. She doesn't need to be broke to be acknowledged. Still your money to decide what to do with though.\n\nAs for the step kids, they weren't in the will.", "You shouldn't have let YOUR disagreement with HIS kids who were already teenagers when you met affect what you did with their father's money. Did you have a strained relationship? Almost certainly? Do I buy your side of the story that it was entirely their fault having met you as teens? Not a chance. Do I think the strained relationship upset your late husband? Definitely but that's also partially his doing so him being upset is in some sense a form of lashing out. YTA and your late husband is the AH. The kids might very well be ah but I would at least need to hear things form their side to make that determination.", "He left it to you.   \nwhat you do with it is no one\u2019s business but yours and the recipient. \n\nHonour your husband\u2019s wishes, if he wanted his kids to have it, it would have been in his will.", "INFO: were you his affair partner? I ask because I\u2019m trying to work out why his kids hated you so much right from the start.", "YTA. They were angry teenagers, and you could have easily proved to them that they were totally incorrect about why you were with their father. Instead, your choice allowed their resentment to fester. I get why you did it, but it wasn\u2019t the right choice.", "I'm struggling with which conflict to put a verdict on here.\n\nBetween you & your daugther, I'm going to say NAH.\n\nBetween you & and the step-kids/ex, you are not the asshole, but they absolutely are.\n\nHonestly, I think it kinda sucks that you didn't give your daughter any of it.  And I think she has every right to be upset about it.\n\n> Not to mention she will get my inheritance.\n\nSo what?  You are 55.  If you are in good health, you have a pretty good shot at living until you are 80+.  So yeah, she might get an inheritance in 35-40 years?\n\nMy mom's older sister was relying on her mother to die to fund her retirement.  One problem:  Her mother lived to 95.  So by the time she passed, she was already in her mid 70s.", "NTA.  Once it was left to you, it was yours to do what you felt was appropriate.  \n\nHe didn't pay for their college due to their mistreatment of you, I doubt that he would have wanted it to go to them anyway.", "You say you treated the steps, HIS kids the same as yours... then go on to delineate that you enjoyed withholding from them money you lavished on your child.\n\nI dont know that you aren't the AH from your account, I think it's possible you alienated them and they went away because of you. \n\nLikely tho unless he wrote a will what you did is fine in the legal sense.\n\n\nNAH", "Probably nta\n\nBut did your husband ever talk to you about distribution?\n\nIf he told you he entrusted you to split it than yta\n\nIf he told you he specifically only wanted you to have it, then you can do with it as you wish\n\n\nTo others.

Sounds like you gave it to someone much more deserving of it anyway.", "NTA - they f*cked around and found out!!", "NTA, you paid her for her caregiver role. They abandoned him and he wouldn\u2019t have left everything to you had he wanted them to have it. They are not deserving of anything and they can deal with it. Your daughter however needs a stern talking to, as she is not entitled to any of the money either.\n\nIt\u2019s also laughable that they called you a gold digger when the estate is worth 25k after being settled.", "NTA.  Just because you are blood related, doesn't automatically entitle you to others peoples things.  They didn't visit or call, and treated you like shit. Nope, they were ungrateful and rude. Then you had a single mom in college waitressesing who still on tip of her own things in her life, made time for you.  That is incredible by itself. She has a kind heart. She deserves it more than anyone.  And even though she wasn't blood related. She was family because she was the one that stood by you and your husband.", "NTA he left it to you, so you can do whatever you want with it.", "NTA.  Your daughter being upset is understandable, but your explanation makes sense.  This stranger is already struggling with time between, kids, school, and work.  Yet she still found the time to help you and your husband in your time of need.  What you did here is very noble and so touching.  No doubt you made a difference in this woman's life for the better!\n\nThe step kids would have probably been angry no matter what and weren't a part of his life.  Ignore their nagging.\n\nI am sorry for your loss.", "NTA", "This makes no sense.  How could they think you are a gold digger when his estate is $25k??  That would make you the least competent gold digger ever.\n\nNTA, but I would explain it to your daughter as compensation for the care this other lady provided.  Also ask your daughter if she needs money for something specific, and help her out if it\u2019s worthwhile.", "NTA\n\nMy condolences. \n\nThe money wasn't theirs to begin with.

That doesn\u2019t mean her expectations were right. Nor that she was entitled to his estate - though having been raised with him since she was seven, I do hope she\u2019s been gifted something more sentimental than cash to remember him. \n\nDid it at least feel good to finally \u201ccorrect the record\u201d with your late husband\u2019s kids?

Years of treating you horribly? Knowing their father is dying and never visiting? \n\nThe person who got the money is not a stranger.

If they were teens when you married, surely they were old enough to process that information. \n\nIf you purposefully left that out because you realized that it caused a wedge between him and his children that makes you an A/H.

Sounds like you were the beneficiary and the children had no relationship with the father.  However I will say by not revealing that you had your own wealth you allowed the belief that you were a good digger to persist.

Basically doing a tit for tat on his kids.  Not sure why the teens / kids were expected to be the bigger person's when all of the 3 parents they had chose to go low. \nNow dad died.

I\u2019m going to be honest and upfront about the ways in which I empathize with his kids. I can very much relate to this situation, and let me tell you, there are two sides to every story. This one is certainly no different. My parents went through a tumultuous divorce and then remarried a few years after when I was around the same age as OP\u2019s step kids. It was incredibly difficult and from what OP wrote, she\u2019s now looking to be validated after the fact about her decision to give away the last remaining chunk of her late husband\u2019s money to a stranger over his own kids. They were adolescents/teens at the time and OP and her husband were the adults and probably didn't integrate them as one family like they should\u2019ve but then years later don\u2019t know why their relationship is seemingly nonexistant. Things don\u2019t start off on the right foot and then take a life of their own. Lots of push and pull, tit for tat. Resentment. The truth is there is more going on here than she\u2019s probably willing to admit, especially because it\u2019s not only one of his kids but both of them? \n\nThe relationship with their father was certainly complicated. I do not agree that OP did the right thing by giving her late husband\u2019s remaining estate/money to a random woman that was perhaps kind and deserving, who showed up for them later in their life. There were other more appropriate ways to be gracious and thank this woman for her many acts of kindness. This wasn\u2019t it. For 25k, it would\u2019ve cost OP very little to do the right thing and make amends and as a last ditch effort of goodwill, allow his two kids to split a modest 12k\u2026I mean cmon. It doesn\u2019t matter if they were not \u201cdeserving\u201d of it. I totally disagree with this. Their relationship with their father was complicated (divorced families are complicated) and I think for OP this was satisfying\u2026 a little last F you to his kids, this nice random lady who helped us out here and there deserved it more than you and is in a hard place as a single mother, etc. I can understand why his kids are upset and personally, it\u2019s very telling that OP\u2019s daughter is asking about her share when it should\u2019ve been seemingly straightforward and split equally between his two kids.\n\nBehind the anger with their father was probably a lot of hurt. Downvote me all you want I don\u2019t care :)", "YTA. Your husband was in all probability sleeping with that waitress prior to his illness.", "Yta", "NTA mostly, but maybe a little to your daughter. If your husband wanted his kids to have part of his estate, he'd have given them part of his estate. Period. Let them pitch their fits, but they got themselves removed from his will all by themselves and that's not your problem. \n\nBut I also understand why your daughter would be upset. Sure it wasn't her father's estate, but it became YOUR money when you inherited it, and you chose not to share your money with your child. The excuse you gave doesn't make sense - the waitress also has a job, right? Is your daughter really that much better off?

It's your money and if there was no will directing you to give it to specific people then you're NTA. \n\nHowever, looking at it from the kids' POV, their dad got married to a person who they assume was a gold digger, and nothing was ever said to them that may have led them to change their minds.

I can\u2019t fathom all of these NTAs, do you have children of your own? I can\u2019t wrap my head around how parents willingly cause the breakdown of the relationship with their children and just carry on with their lives. Men and women remarry and I swear their previous children become baggage in their eyes. Your husband choose not to help them with college, he choose to punish them, you both choose to lie to them. Did you assist them with getting use to this new family structure? Apparently you guys have money, did you try therapy? I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s such a shock to people that children and young adults struggle with new changes in their parents lives.

It was cancer. \n\nHe had two kids from a past marriage who were in their early teens when he married me. I had a 7 year old from an earlier relationship as well. We didn't have anymore kids. \n\nI tried to treat my step children as my own but they never accepted me. They were very rude and insulted me whenever they could. Since I did not work they called me a gold digger who married their dad only for his money. \n\nThe truth was my grandparents were quite wealthy and left me a lot of money when they died. I lived well below my means and chose to stay home and raise my daughter, since I could afford that. I did not need his money at all. But I didn't bother sharing this with his kids and told him not to either. I did not want to like me just because they might gain monetarily from me. \n\nMy husband on the other hand hated how they behaved with me. Their blatant disrespect made him not pay for their College tuition. Their mom couldn't pay for it and they had to take loans for it. They didn't even talk to him. \n\nEven when he got cancer, they refused to come see him. For three years we struggled with the treatment. My daughter came to visit time to time when she could. \n\nDuring this time only person who really helped both of us was someone we were not related to at all. This girl in her late 20s waitressed at a cafe we frequented. She was a single mom, taking classes at community college at night, working during day and raising her two kids. She took a liking to us and when she learned my husband was sick, spend whatever time she could visiting him. She has stayed nights at the hospital when I needed a break and basically been the daughter we wished for. \n\nWhen he died, she helped me arrange the funeral. His kids came on the day and all they wanted to know was about their inheritance. I felt sick. \n\nWhen I learned my husband has left his estate to me, (whatever is left after settling his bills, and it was around $25000), I decided to give it to the girl who helped us both so much. She tried to refuse but I insisted she take it. She needed it and in my opinion deserved it more than the ungrateful children. \n\nMy daughter understands why I did not give it to his children but is upset I did not give anything to her either. I told her she already had money and a job. Not to mention she will get my inheritance. This was in no way her money. \n\nBut his ex wife and kids are causing havoc over this and really upset with me. They are calling me AH for giving away money they deserve. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
