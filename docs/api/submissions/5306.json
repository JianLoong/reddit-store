You're paying for a dorm room and he is making it unusable and putting your health in danger AND HE KNOWS IT.\n\nYour last option is to let him know that if he doesn't stop, you will be applying for a transfer and will have to let the University know why. That might convince him, though honestly he would probably be a passive-aggressive jerk for the rest of the year and would conveniently \"forget\" haha as often as he thinks he can get away with it.", "NTA.\nThe fact he seems to have zero respect for you and the other housemates, by continuing to smoke & vape and wont even compromise by doing it outside?? \nSorry dude. \n\nI'd be telling the university. Your health and well being is paramount.", "NTA\n\nYou asked him to go outside and it is for your health, maybe give him one last chance to vape somewhere else (ofc add that it's aggravating your symptoms) and if he decides to put you at risk for his comfort, you can perfectly put his studies at risk for your health, seems fair.", "NTA. Your health should be your priority. For the traitor part, you should tell him the reason why you're requesting him to vape outside. If he did not oblige, then do what you must.", "NTA but I would talk to the roommate first", "NTA. If he can't be considerate of the effect his smoking has on you knowing that he is breaking the rules then he deserves the punishment that will be given to him because he didn't want to inconvenience himself.", "NTA\nhe goes against the rules, he has to to live with the consequences", "NTA. It's reasons like this that such options exist. Report away guilt-free!", "NTA - you asked him politely, he declined. You have to think of your health.", "Nta. Your health > his weed", "NTA. Report his ass. He doesn't care about your health don't care about his status in college. Your health is more important.", "NTA\n\nOne of the first thing you learn about sharing rooms it's to don't go out of your way giving favors to complete strangers, 90% of the time they won't do the same for you. It's nice you 3 decide to not snitch but this just lead into you roommate feeling entitled over the space and don't giving a crap about how much he bothering other roommate's over it.\n\nAlso consider that if the faculty find out your roommate weed but they don't figure out who owns it e everyone in the room will get in trouble and probably kick out. Now you also worsening your health for someone that sound like a complete asshole. Come clean and be the snitch so faculty can lead with your roommate for you and everyone's ekse sake, if he wants to smoke he can go find a spot outside like anyone else with some care fo others will do.", "If you break housing rules, you have to be prepared to get caught. \n\nIf you want your roommate to cover for you, you have to give them a reason to. \n\nIf you make your roommate's nights hell and do things that prevent them from being able to breathe, you have to understand that your roommate is going to want to get out of this situation ASAP. \n\nNTA. Your roommate is hoping that you'd feel bad enough about reporting him to not do that even if he keeps putting your health at risk. Don't fall for it.", "NTA but be ready for the other roommates to side against you since you will indeed be labeled a snitch in school college is filled with drugs, booze, and parties so there can be some serious frat boy vibes on campus with cliques of guys even though your completely not in the wrong they could easily rat you out right back for knowingly letting him do it for so long so technically you are also guilty by association in the schools eyes so he careful what you say and best of luck", "say he smokes cigirettes and use the same reason.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Either he stops smoking in there or you need to move rooms, or he can move rooms. He can decide but he should know that you have to tell them the reason when you request to move.

You can make him choose: change his habits to accomodate your illness or get reported.

Asking him to smoke outside was a pretty simple and easy fix that he refuses. If he gets kicked out that's his own fault", "NTA.\n\nI agree with the other commentor who said to give him the option of \"smoke outside or I'll have to report it,\" but if you're the nonconfrontational sort/unwilling to go that route could you maybe tell the university that it's a secondhand smoke on his clothing issue? As in, tell the university that roommate smokes outside as he's supposed to but that the smoke on his clothing still triggers your condition? I suspect you could get your doctor to write a note backing that up if needed, and it would avoid getting the roommate in trouble.", "NTA, your health is far more important and you already asked him to do it outside as a good compromise, if he wants to be an unreasonable asshole, let's see how much his act lasts when the university kicks him out.", "NTA- but you might have asthma. It\u2019s often triggered around irritants like smoke. \n\nThe fact that your breathing gets better when the smoke is gone AND you\u2019re wheezing, leads me to believe you need an inhaler ASAP.", "NTA, he's the one breaking the rules", "This is how I told my son to handle that situation in college. Tell the powers that be you have a serious personality clash and need to change housing. That is a valid reason!

Your health is more important.", "i mean you could explicitly state to him that if he doesn't take it elsewhere you are going to have to request a room change.\n\ni don't think it's necessary honestly because it should be pretty obvious. you could mention it to your roommates if you haven't- basically just a 'hey, i've mentioned this to smokey but because of my breathing problems i'm going to have to report his vaping because i can't stay in this room. it's just making me too sick and i wanted you to hear it from me first.\"\n\nnothing open to opinions. more of an awareness that smokey is going to give everyone a very one sided story so you should probably get your side in first.", "then he made choices he knew had consequences and its not up to you sacrificing your health to enable his choices."]}
