Let her decorate the venue (if you didn't hire), or gather people together when it's time for a photoshoot, help pin flowers on the groomsmen.... just ideas.  Hopefully she won't change it up on you. I don't know if you have explained why you aren't entertaining her ideas, but if you haven't, that might  clarify your needs to her.

I would suggest that might have to actually be public or at least in the same forum as the boundary overstep - Mum gets stompy in a group chat, have the very firm boundary setting in the same group chat, Mum gets stompy at a shower, let her have it there."]}
