If she starts talking about something for the wedding, just walk out of wherever you are.  NTAH.", "Can't stand the momzillas. They had their weddings, now it's your turn to enjoy yours. Do it how you want it", "NTA\n\nEveryone should have a mother like mine who told me how much money I had to spend, sent me dress shopping with my Dad, and generally let me plan my own wedding. \n\nI am sorry you aren't getting that emotional support. Weddings can be stressful to plan.", "NTA\n\nIt wouldn't be HORRIBLE if your mum seemed to have your best interest at heart, but she just wants a wedding **she** thinks will look pretty. The ideas seem to be the opposite of your chosen ones. If there was an ounce of respect in her suggestions, I might tell you to entertain her because she's trying, but she ain't trying at all. \n\nHonestly if this happened to  me i'd give an ultimatum. Stop overstepping, or lose your invite.", "But with veto power lol. You don\u2019t want inappropriate pics of the couple in a slideshow!", "NTA!!  \nYou need to stay strong and keep your mother under control. She had her wedding, it's your turn to make your own decisions!!", "NTA", "Outburst? Well, nothing you did or said beforehand seems to have worked, so she brought it on herself. You\u2019re the bride, she isn\u2019t. What you say goes. End of.", "NTA. Your wedding, your decisions. Simple as.", "NTA. I have the opposite issue, I have been elected to plan daughters (step) wedding, and I can't get any input other than the colors and a waterfall! Everytime I run something by her, its \"I know you will do great\", or \"we like that idea\"...", "NTA- It's your wedding and you've told her no repeatedly.", "NTA. \n\nYou can love someone and still want to throw them out the nearest window when they play whack-a-mole on your last nerve.", "Call your vendors and password protect your shit. Sounds like your mom is the type to try qnd change things behind your back.", "NTA  Your wedding, you get to say what happens.  I am sure that if your mother wasn't going behind your back so much, you would be more willing to listen. Is your mom paying for the whole wedding?  If so, then she should have some input.  But at the end of the day, this is yours and your fiance's wedding, not your mother's!  Ask her is her mother did this to her at her wedding. \n\nThen you kindly tell her you love her and she needs to back off unless she is willing to come to you whenever she has an idea and to not be upset if it is rejected.", "NTA.  But please learn to set firm boundaries and consequences so this behavior doesn\u2019t continue.  Because it will.  She is a bully and has gotten away with it for far too long", "NTA honestly I\u2019d uninvite her cause you know day of, she\u2019s gonna be a nightmare", "NTA, if she has ideas she needs to bring them to you privately, not blast them into the group chat/start coercing other family members.", "NTA. Come on over to r/raisedbynarcissists. I think you'll fit right in."]}
