Otherwise she has no say.\n\nI will acknowledge there may be an implication here based on who is paying for the wedding. It's messy but if she is covering expenses, it should still be your preferences but it would be respectful to honor certain things she wants (esp as it relates to expense, such as respecting a budget for a menu that supports a chicken dish but not filet...).  \n\n\nEDIT: I'd left out a word in the first sentence of my second paragraph.", "nta", "NTA & you know it.

If parents mostly pay for the wedding they aren't hosting but reasonable requests by them should be considered and rejected if absolutely untenable. If parents don't host and don't give money without strings their money should be refused and the bride and groom should have the wedding exactly as they choose.

Because I can promise you that she will try to change things behind your back.", "NTA, from what you're telling us, she isn't respecting your  decisions and sounds like she is trying to relive a wedding she never got or drempt of having for herself. After everything she has been told by you about how you want your wedding, she is still suggesting the complete opposite of what you presented, and that is disrespectful. It's your wedding. \n\nI understand she wants to help, so maybe you can delegate tasks for her to do (?) Such as calling the catering company of your choice and have her order what you want. Let her decorate the venue (if you didn't hire), or gather people together when it's time for a photoshoot, help pin flowers on the groomsmen.... just ideas.  Hopefully she won't change it up on you. I don't know if you have explained why you aren't entertaining her ideas, but if you haven't, that might  clarify your needs to her. If you have told her your expectations/details of your wedding, sounds like she needs constant reminders of what you expect. \n\nHopefully this helps and congrats!", "NTA. Keep your shiny spine, OP and stand firm. This is your day, not hers. She can organize a vow renewal or something if she wants her own.

She's trying to enforce her preferences on you. A suggestion doesn't involve taking steps to implement it without your consent.

Your mom spent money on a dress without even consulting you, there's no obligation there. The obligation would be if she offered to buy an expensive dress you chose together - the unspoken strings are you accept the money and choose a dress she approves of. Agree or decline, either choice is valid. Her buying a dress without your input isn't something you can agree to or decline so it's her problem to resolve, you never agreed to it even with strings attached to the money.", "Nope, I think your outburst was entirely justified as other attempts to establish boundaries seems to have been ignored or discarded by her.
