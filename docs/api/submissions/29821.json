Her sister was under age and asleep, so unable to consent. Doing it purposefully in her presence and boasting about it later in life is disgusting. You were right to call her out", "NTA.

I get that it got weird and uncomfortable for you, and you are NTA. I've been in a similar situation a couple of times, so I understand you.
