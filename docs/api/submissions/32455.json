{"id": 32455, "submission_id": "18c3v9o", "title": "AITA for wanting to wear pajamas/baggy clothes while going out in public with my boyfriend?", "selftext": "So for context, me (20f) and my boyfriend (20m) were going out to a shopping center about a week ago. This area is popular and it's always decorated beautifully festive for the holidays. Maybe this is just me acting like a bum, but I thought it would be cute to wear those red flannel/plaid (idk what to call it) pajama pants with a regular black hoodie. Something about it being Christmas made it seem charming.\nI ask him what he thought of the outfit, and he immediately said \"no.\" I was a bit surprised.\n\nHe says he believes pajamas are only to be worn in the house, and to wear them in public tells the world \"I have no self respect.\" I was surprised again and told him I've got self respect, and just thought it'd look cute. He then says it'd be disrespectful to him if I wore them out while with him. Which I tried to understand from his perspective. I ended up switching to a more acceptable option: gray sweatpants.\n\nFast forward to last night. We were already upset sharing our feelings about a different topic, and eventually he brings up the pajamas again. I still cannot believe we're talking about the pajamas so I am completely stunned and ask something along the lines of \"are we seriously still talking about that outfit I wanted to wear?\" \n\nThen he tells me about how it's not just that outfit and that many of my clothes are baggy and too big for me and how I look completely dwarfed by my clothes when they don't fit my form. Lots of my casual clothes are t-shirts that are too big for me (they're M, I'm XS-S and even the ones in my size look big bc I'm a small girl) and some color of sweatpants. I never thought anything bad about my baggy clothes until this conversation. He says he knows I have better, really cute and well-fitting outfits, so it comes off as lazy and me not caring about what I look like when I leave in bigger clothes.\n\nsome quotes from him last night:\n\n\"I want to show you off and be proud to be next to you but it's hard when you don't put any effort into your appearance\"\n\"I want you to look good if not for yourself then for me \"\n\nI understand why he didn't want me to wear pjs in public and I respect it, but he also just called out like 50% of my wardrobe. \nWhen I don't wear those clothes, I have dressed and a skirt, jeans, joggers, and some slacks. But like 75% of my regular shirts don't hug my body at all. I love this man. I want for him to feel comfortable being seen with me. It's just that this hurt my feelings, mostly because I didn't know he felt this way about my casual wear.\n\nAm I just being insensitive or lazy? AITA?\n\nedit: INFO- This wasn't a date. We were out running errands and he wasn't dressed up. We've been together over 4 years, I've always worn generally looser clothes and he's never brought this up before. Yes I am American, he is too, but he lived in Europe/Middle East for a long time as a kid. \n\n", "created_utc": 1701868960, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18c3v9o/aita_for_wanting_to_wear_pajamasbaggy_clothes/", "score": 1699, "replies": ["This thread is now locked due to an excess of rule violations. \r\n\r\n[Sub Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/) ||| [\"FAQs\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)", "NAH.

Initially I was going to say N A H, because I know a lot of people who are appalled at the idea of going out in public in loungewear (because I WAS one of those people until I stopped caring about my appearance, although even today I would say it\u2019s not cute to wear pjs in public), and he\u2019s allowed to say \u201cno\u201d to your idea if he didn\u2019t like it.

Wear whatever you want when you go out in public, but keep in mind that not everyone thinks pajamas look cute in public. In fact I bet that most people think they look silly.", "NTA. My husband has never policed what I wear and neither have I to him. I tend to overdress at times where he\u2019s a minimalist and only puts in the effort for special occasions. We love each other for who we are. You are young so you may not know but this is a \ud83d\udea9. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being comfortable as long as you know when to dress for the occasion. I believe that you do. His comment of \u201cI just want to show you off\u201d rubs me the wrong way. \n\nYou\u2019re more than your looks. You are a whole person, not just eye candy for him to show off. Maybe he\u2019s not the one for you if he desires a woman dressed to the nines every time she leaves the house. Leaving the house comfortable is practical in a lot of situations, especially as you get older. There\u2019s also a difference between comfortable and unkempt! And what you suggested isn\u2019t unkempt, lazy, dirty, etc. \n\nHe\u2019s suggesting that you embarrass him and I don\u2019t like that. He should love you and stand by your side regardless of what you\u2019re wearing.", "NTA.  On the narrow issue of PJs in public, I do think you asked for his POV, and he shared it.

If my spouse went out wearing PJ\u2019s as clothes, I wouldn\u2019t be seen with him. Have some self-respect. I take care to look nice and he should do the same.

I love wearing super stylish outfits sometimes but I also wear a lot of baggy graphic tee and sweatpants outfits. It just depends on my mood. Maybe it's the autism, but I just can't understand why one of those is \"right\" and the other is \"wrong\".

Both people should dress in the same genre of apparel when they are on a date.  He needed to ditch the gym clothes for that, I bet you looked great!", "I agree. Maybe this is one of those situations where \"dressing up\" for him is necessary in certain occasions, just like the importance of punctuality however, if he got to know you wearing loose clothing and all, I think it's a little too late for him to act surprised. Right now, he's complaining about you not dressing up, but if you dress up, he might start complaining about how you are dressing up.

Anyway, I think ppl should wear what they like, but still put in effort if there is an occasion. And I wouldn't call going out shopping an occasion, same as baggy clothes don't have to mean you are not putting an effort if this is your style. Yeah, you should probably wear something else to a fancy restaurant. But she mentions she wears dresses slacks etc. So for me, it seems like if there is an occasion she does dress up, she just likes baggy clothes for every day and I don't see anything wrong with it.", "Then why is he with her? Why does his opinion of her attire matter more in the relationship than her comfort or enjoyment?", "Then that\u2019s his problem. Rather than control what she wears he should find someone whose style is more compatible with his, if it\u2019s that important to him. I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s just the clothes, though.
