She refused to have anyone bring kids to her wedding as she didn\u2019t want \u201clittle brats\u201d ruining her big day. She made a big deal about this during her wedding process.\nShe had 8 bridesmaids and I had to manage all of them (only 3 of them are still in contact with her). I wasn\u2019t allowed to change my hairstyle, gain any weight in fact I was encouraged to lose weight (I have always been on the thinner side than is recommended for my height as I grew up with eating issues from being body shamed my whole life). I had to organise and pay for a bridal shower, kitchen tea and hens weekend because she demanded all three events but refused to pay for anything because \u201capparently that\u2019s not what a brides supposed to do\u201d. The list could go on. Her wedding day was icing on the cake but I kept the peace like I was told and did everything that was asked of me.\n\nCurrent problem!\nI (26 f) am excited to be planning my own wedding with my fianc\u00e9 (28 m). I have to have Julie as my MOH otherwise I will cause WWIII, even though I don\u2019t really want her as my MOH, I\u2019ll keep the peace and agree.\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have both made the decision no kids to our wedding and to every couple we have spoken to about this they are thrilled for a parents night off.\nJulie has her rainbow baby boy (Charlie) and has been giving me hell because I have told her no children are coming to wedding. She assumed that didn\u2019t include Charlie but I have repeatedly told her to respect our decision and the boundary we have set. This argument comes up weekly even though my fianc\u00e9 and I have sat down with her and her husband to discuss this.\nMy parents don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m being difficult about this issue and should just let her have her way. Julie has always been the golden child and been spoilt growing up. My dad says I need to stop being difficult and I\u2019m really hurt and disappointed but not surprised that my family isn\u2019t respecting my decisions as they haven\u2019t respected me my whole life. \nHere is where I maybe the asshole and a bit of a bridezilla. Julie has made it clear that she won\u2019t be able to focus on anything if Charlie isn\u2019t at the wedding. But I know if he is there she will have her whole attention on him and I refuse to have my day stalled and delayed in half hour increments because she has to feed him or give him extra TLC. A wedding in my opinion does not resolve around a 13month old!\nI told her that I understand her priorities have changed now that she is a parent. But if Charlie comes to the wedding she doesn\u2019t get to be a bridesmaid. She\u2019s throwing a tantrum and her, my brother in law and my parents think I\u2019m the asshole.\nMy fianc\u00e9 is standing by my decision but am I being a bridezilla by not wanting to have to stress about a toddler running around and worrying about where my MOH is all day because she keeps disappearing? \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691051238, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gy6p2/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_can_no_longer_be_a/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The choice is hers", "NTA.\n\nNot sure how many times I\u2019ve had to say this:\n\nThe wedding is about the couple getting married.  The guests\u2019 job is to help them celebrate the day.  If you do ANYTHING to make that day difficult for the couple you don\u2019t belong there.", "NTA - it\u2019s you\u2019re wedding and you\u2019re allowed to stick to child free for everyone and not make exceptions. If your sister can\u2019t handle being away from Charlie than she doesn\u2019t \n\n\nA little bit of tough love: You are being an AH to yourself. You\u2019ve allowed and continue to allow your family to control and make demands of you and you\u2019re complying. By your own omission your need to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d and expecting to be disrespected is causing you hurt. It\u2019s time to stand up to them and be firm in your decision. \u201cMom, dad, sister, we have made the decision that there will be no children at the wedding, no exceptions. If sister can\u2019t handle this, she does not need to come to the wedding, if she brings her son, she will be asked to leave. M/d, if you cannot respect our decision, you are also entitled to not attend the wedding.\u201d Also, replace her as your MOH, you don\u2019t want her in that role so you should not have her in that role.  Make your wedding/life about what you want and what will make you happy and not about what will keep everyone civil.", "NtA. Best to not include her. She\u2019s already ruining the wedding experience for you this early with her entitlement . She might even sabotaged your wedding by going there with baby in her Arms while part of your entourage. Your family are AH too for not supporting you like they supported her on her wedding. Don\u2019t budge. Stand your ground. Have the wedding you invisioned and paid for.", "NTA- are these the same parents who made you pay for everything.\n\nAlthough I must say, they didn\u2019t make you, expected you too, and you obliged. \n\nStick to your morals and remind her that only 6 years ago she had said the same.", "NTA\n\nI honestly don't understand the whole \"child-free\" wedding. It's bullocks to me.\n\nHowever, this is quite an ironic scenario as she actually had a child-free wedding and now doesn't like it when the same rule applies to her.\n\nI actually think you are compromising. You're saying: \"Even though this is a child-free wedding I'm open to making an exception for my nephew. However, I do want a MOH that will be focused on me so I don't think someone with a toddler is the way to go\"", "NTA.\n\nBut OP you said you let her be your maid of honor to keep the peace, but the peace is not being kept anyway, so what are you gaining by keeping her as maid of honor?", "NTA - why was it ok for her to have a child free wedding but not you ?    \nI know it is devastating losing a baby, before or after birth, as well as trouble conceiving.  \nBut I am tired of this rainbow baby bullshit where everyone has to treat the kid like they\u2019re the second coming", "NTA\nto be fair you should uninvite your parents.\nThey created this monster.\nI think you\u2019re used to being emotionally abused by your family so it\u2019s awesome you have set this boundary. It\u2019s not just your day but your soon to be husbands too. The fact he\u2019s backing you 100% is great. He won\u2019t want it ruined either.", "NTA--You're being too nice by even letting her come if she insists on bringing her child.  Tell her she can join you for your childless celebration of your marriage just like you did for her or she can stay home, nevermind being in the wedding party.", "NTA- please uninvite her and consider doing the same for your family.  A great therapist to help you detangle yourself from your family who sound toxic AF would be really beneficial for you right now\n\nThis is you and your future husbands day.  That\u2019s it.  If your family can\u2019t support you and you alone then they can spend the day with those other people and not at your wedding.", "NTA.   \nSometimes WWIII is necessary in order to start fresh.

Julie has a simple choice to make: arrange suitable care for Charlie or stand down as a bridesmaid.

It's you and your fiances decision about kids at the wedding. Im sorry. Rainbow babies aren't God's gift to everyone else. Do not budge on this.", "NTA. You're about to start your own family. It's not your job to keep the peace . Tell your sister that you're disappointed she won't respect the same boundaries she set at her own wedding.

Your wedding, your rules. \nPlease ask your parents why these rules were absolutely fine for her wedding but not for yours??\nYou should also send her an itemised bill of what you forked out for her wedding and tell her that she has to reciprocate and if she cannot then that's 2 strikes.
