My son is the one here and in my arms.\n\nNot to mention comparing someone to someone else anyways or trying to make them into what you think they should be is completely shitty. Nonetheless a child hearing about a sibling that never made it earth side constantly will most certainly make them think they arnt as important as them."]}
