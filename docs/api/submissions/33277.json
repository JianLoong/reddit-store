{"id": 33277, "submission_id": "18l9vpw", "title": "AITA for not signing off on my ex-SIL using my nephew\u2019s money to buy presents for her other kids?", "selftext": "My (34f) brother \u201cDave\u201d passed away 3 years ago, leaving behind his wife, \u201cIssy\u201d, and son \u201cMiles\u201d (now 8). Issy has two other children (11 year old twins) from her ex. When Dave died, he left all his money in a trust structure for Miles. Issy is only allowed to use the money to take care of Miles, and In order to access any of the money, Issy must have my written agreement or the trustees will not release funds. This money pays for Miles\u2019s prep school. \n\nThere have been occasions in the past where Issy has lied about what she wants money for, and I\u2019ve signed off on her getting money only for her to not use the money for Miles, but for things for her other kids. Since I realised this, I normally just buy things Miles needs out of my own pocket so that Issy can\u2019t use these needs as an excuse to extort money. \n\nA few days ago Issy called me and said she needed some money and she wanted to be honest this time. She said she had no money after bills and other expenses to buy Christmas presents for her kids this year, and wanted to use some of Miles\u2019s money to do so. She said she won\u2019t spend extravagantly, but she knows that Miles will be getting big gifts from our side of the family and she won\u2019t be able to give her kids anything. She said she doesn\u2019t want the twins to resent Miles more than they already do (Miles has told me they bully him at home) and that she just needs a bit of help to make things equal. \n\nI was a bit irritated that she was trying to excuse her lack of parenting as the childrens\u2019 fault and that the only way she could think to stop her kids\u2019 bad behaviour is use Miles\u2019s money as a shortcut. Ultimately I said no, because I feel like spending Miles\u2019s money on people who are cruel to him would not be what he wanted (he\u2019s not old enough that I want to burden him by asking him directly), and would be against the spirit of the trust my brother set up. \n\nIssy has been blowing up my phone making me feel like trash for saying no, saying I am ruining her Christmas and making Miles\u2019s siblings hate him more, and it\u2019s really starting to get to me. But on the other hand I\u2019m not sure I can justify saying yes, and I don\u2019t want this to open the door to further requests.\n\nAt the end of the day this is not even my money, someday Miles will have access to the money and the accounts and every time I sign off on a request, I think if I had to answer to an older Miles, would I be able to justify the purchase, and the answer here was no. \n\nBut I\u2019m really struggling. AITA?\n\nEdit: answers to FAQs\n\n1. Why did Dave \u201chate\u201d his wife? I don\u2019t know. We weren\u2019t very close before he died and the seances have not given me a clear answer. I have no clue why he did it this way, please stop asking.\n\n2. Does Issy receive an allowance from the trust? No. \n\n3. Why can\u2019t I give Issy an allowance? I cannot change the terms of the trust. I cannot make the trust pay out a monthly stipend. As I understand it, not even the trustees can do that. If there was a man allowance stated in the trust, they could adjust the amount but since there wasn\u2019t, I don\u2019t believe they can allocate one. \n\n4. Can Issy sell her house? No. The house is in trust, she can\u2019t sell it. It is fully paid off and she has no mortgage or rent payments to make on it.

Why are the trustees not making these decisions?", "NTA\n\nThat money has an express purpose, and it isn't to fund any shortfalls the mother has.

Personally, I'd leave your nephews money and have your family contribute some gifts for those 2 children.\n\nYou stand firm about never making exceptions with your nephews' money, though.", "Ah, so for Miles to avoid bullying, his mother wants him to essentially pay protection money to his step-siblings to get them to lay off.\n\nWill he be having to do this every year?

You have a duty to use the funds in the manner that they were intended and doing so could get you in trouble. As far as I am aware, you have to track every sent that leaves that trust and account for it. The trust is set up in the interest of Miles to cover education and then pass to him when he's 21, not to buy Christmas presents.", "NTA.

SIL for obvious reasons.\n\nThese other kids, the twins, were your husband's stepkids, right? For at least 6 years while he was alive. And he left them and his wife NOTHING? Y'all have been family with these kids since they were toddlers and their mom knows, with certainty to expect your family to get a ton of gifts for the one child related to you by blood and NOTHING for the other children that your brother apparently chose to raise?\n\nWas your brother planning to divorce her prior to his death or something because this setup is such a dick move on his part. I can't imagine setting up a trust fund for private school tuition for one child while the other two are just barely getting by.", "She HAD the opportunity to sign up with charities for gifts for her 11yo children ( it\u2019s too late now). They often scrutinize income and decide if recipient really needs  charity .\nThe main problem here is the bullying.Have you done anything about that besides criticize her parenting ? Do you need to ask for a formal intervention  or offer your nephew a place to live? I doubt having nice gifts this year is going to stop that behavior.\nIf you want just an easy out for your conscience then give her some of your own funds to help her out and see if your nephew says that makes any difference .I suspect it will not and you will be back to square one\u2014what are YOU going to do about the bullying ?", "Info: Just to be sure, Miles and the twins are half siblings correct?", "You have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure that the funds are appropriately expended.

If your brother left his wife nothing that would have affected her household income drastically and he is an AH. Is Issy working? She will have to adjust her lifestyle if her husband screwed her over like that. \n\nI am leaning towards NTA for you though because it sounds like you were a bit more generous with the money in the immediate aftermath. After some time passed and you realized she was lying to you, you tightened the reigns on trust as is your responsibility. It has been 3 years now so she has had time to adjust and she needs to find a budget that works for her without taking from Miles account. Also Christmas presents are not a necessity. It's not like she's asking you for food and shelter she's asking for a shopping spree for a holiday.", "Nta document you ex sil misusing your nephews funds have swyers deal with her its obly going ti get worse", "NTA\n\nLet the trustees know what's going on so they're aware.  \n\nYou have a responsibility to your nephew to not spend his money on things that aren't directly for him.  His mother needs to budget her own money.", "Maybe. Did you and yours ever consider buying his siblings gifts as well since regardless of their mother, they are Miles\u2019 family? Then your not giving her money, but also treating your late brothers children and step children as a group who should be separate from the drama. \n\nAlso, if I read later comments correctly, how could your brother not leave a regular amount for the care of his son and instead force her to prostrate herself for everything. Your brother may be TA for putting her and you in this position.", "INFO: Are you legally bound to uphold the requirements of the trust?", "INFO: Has your family always treated Issy as an unwelcome outsider? And did your brother normally go along with and/or encourage this? Were there signs when he was alive of the disdain he clearly had for her and his stepchildren?\n\nI'm sorry, but I find this whole situation very, very strange. Something is clearly very foul about the whole thing, and you putting it on her as a \"greedy, graspy widow with bullying children\" doesn't sit right given the bigger picture that you've portrayed here.\n\nFirst of all, I can't help but notice that you refer to your brother's widow as your \"ex-SIL\" despite the fact that she is no such thing. She and your brother were still married at the time of his death. Most people would still consider their sibling's widow/widower their family. Sort of like people who refer to someone's widow as their \"ex\", this seems to be in poor taste at best.\n\nBut more importantly, I have to ask: just how much contempt did your brother have for his own wife and life partner (never mind the stepchildren he had raised since toddlerhood) that he clearly had VERY significant financial resources, and yet chose to leave absolutely no financial safety net for her or to the children they raised together, and left a trust planned in a manner that was clearly intended not simply to ensure the well-being of their child together, but to ensure that she and the other children NOT be able to benefit from it under any circumstances.\n\nThis is the sort of set-up one normally has after an ugly divorce . . . not a trust written into a will by someone who is still married to, and ostensibly in love with, their partner.\n\nThe way you speak of Issy as your \"ex-SIL\" and try to make her out to be a gold-digger despite the fact that it seems that what she really is, is a widow who was left with three children and an ex-husband so confusingly petty that he left vast resources for exactly ONE of them to have private school and privilege, but NOTHING to ensure that his own wife (not ex-wife, wife) could keep a roof over her head or food on the table . . . all of this paints a picture of YOUR family being really toxic and problematic.\n\nI find it impossible to render a clear judgement because you're obviously an unreliable narrator, but it seems like whether or not you're THE AH, you're certainly AN AH, as was your brother.", "Nta. And the important thing to remember that your brother put you in charge of the trust for Miles, not his wife, he wanted to make sure miles got his inheritance and it not be used for other items. It\u2019s reasonable to feel guilty for kids not getting super Christmas, but your brother has entrusted that you are strong enough to carry that burden for miles future.", "NTA.  Money is not hers and Dave probably added you as a signatory to prevent this from happening.", "Does the child get death benefits? How are those funds used?", "NTA but Issy sure is. Instead of protecting Miles she\u2019s using him for money to buy her older kids\u2019 gifts? I think you did the right thing. It\u2019s just going to open the floodgates for other things she needs money for to \u201cmake it even\u201d for her kids. Perhaps use some money for therapy for Miles to deal with the bullying and find out if anything is going on that warrants reporting Issy for his safety. Edit word", "NTA...This is not a question of survival.  You have an ethical duty to follow your brother's instructions.  Your SIL needs to find another method of managing life's demands.", "NTA! Clearly Miles dad did not trust his wife with money. That is incredibly sad, but he was safe guarding his childs future. You have the best in mind for him. Its hard, but keep it up. I hope miles knows how much his father loved him. Mom is a real piece of work though", "NTA\n\nYou are absolutely right. It\u2019s a breach of fiduciary duty to give the money for anything other than the beneficiary. Once he becomes of age he\u2019s entitled to a full accounting.

Doesn\u2019t she have an ex baby daddy to cry to for money so her other two kids can have gifts?  She should also be getting survivor benefits for Miles since his father is deceased.", "\u2026.why did your brother not want to provide for the stepkids who he assumedly has parented for a minimum of 8 years? Is there more info there? Because that\u2019s incredibly spiteful behavior. That\u2019s very important information before I\u2019m willing to lay a judgement.", "NTA, because, while your SIL will certainly blame the lack of presents on Miles, you know she\u2019s not going to give him credit if you did give her the money. For her to blame the $ for her kids bullying Miles is also gross and gives a hint that it\u2019s not going to stop any time soon, no matter what you do.\n\nAt least Miles knows he has a better opportunities in his future due to you protecting his $ and an entire family that cares enough about him and his future to make the tough decisions.

They\u2019re not bad kids because they feel shitty about the material disparity. \n\nYour SIL is in a terrible position and she probably feels like she needs to make up for her older children\u2019s lack of similar resources. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, but you do need to develop some empathy.", "NTA\n\n Your brother knew what he was doing by making you the executor of his estate.

She can reach out to them.\n\nYou should be reporting every time she lies about needing money for Miles and then spends it on herself/her other kids.\n\nYou were trusted to make sure Miles' money was spent on HIM and only for his needs.

Issy has no mortgage payment as the house is paid  for in the trust. Miles' school is being paid for. And she should be getting survivor benefits as well. That's a better financial situation compared to many other single parents. If she can't manage her remaining expenses, that's her problem and not on Miles. She sounds financially irresponsible so Dave was right to protect his money for his son. Just cause he was married to single mom, doesn't make those other kids entitled to his money. It's possible that she didn't even let him have a parental role at all.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t set up the trust and you are just following the terms of said trust.

Unfortunately, life is not always fair.", "I get a sneaking suspicion that Dave knew his wife would attempt this hence why he set the fund up in a way that only his sibling would be able to sign off on funds being released. It seems to me that Issy was financially irresponsible, and Dave did not trust that the money would be spent as SHOULD BE. He wanted to ensure that HIS BIOLOGICAL CHILD would never go without because of that irresponsibility and he did that. OP you\u2019re not wrong at all. Tell her to hit the twins dad up for some money if she wants to make their Christmas nice because it\u2019s not Miles\u2019 responsibility.", "So Miles is being bullied by his step brothers and his mother has been misusing his trust to benefit his bullies?

But, is it possible to have a conversation with Issy about what she spends on her other two sons and make sure Miles gets something comparable in holiday gifts that meet his needs and desires? For example, if Issy can only afford to buy sneakers for her sons; and you and Miles\u2019 family members buy him sneakers, a computer, an Xbox, a new iPhone, and an all expense paid vacation to Disney World, I think Issy has a valid point\u2026.\n\nI taught for years in a working class school district. Some kids just before Christmas were super excited about the holiday. They knew they were coming back to school in January with the latest whatever hot item was being sold each year. Other kids just had huge melt downs. They were from poor families and the jealousy just ate them up. Children are wholly unprepared for the innate unfairness of life.

From what I gather from reading your comments- there\u2019s a trust, life insurance and other assets went into the trust, the house is also in trust. Presumably Issy inherited something, but almost everything went to Miles. Her kids are bullying and being nasty to Miles- which isn\u2019t surprising- they\u2019re all siblings and Miles is over here getting prep school and the things he wants and his extended family on his dads side has money and is providing.

This could be less about the money and more about the need to live more affordable which she literally cannot do because her husband was rich (from what it sounds like) and locked her into an area she doesn't have the means to afford, even without a mortgage payment.", "Yeah like, this actually seems like a very well laid out plan to ensure that his child was provided for. It seems like his brother did everything RIGHT.", "OP already answered this question and said she does not", "What does the trust say exactly? Is it for health, education, maintenance and support of Miles? Or something else? Fully discretionary and Miles is just the only beneficiary?", "They don\u2019t see their father, I believe she does get child support but it\u2019s likely minimal", "She should be getting child support for miles. Why does this kid have a trust fund and mom is covering all of his monthly expenses and the loss of income custodial parents have when they raise children? No Xmas money for the other kids isn\u2019t appropriate\u2026. But so is not getting money every month to cover miles rent utilities and food", "That\u2019s a good point. It\u2019s also just slightly odd that Dave left *all* of his money in trust for his son, and *none* of it to his wife, who he presumably loved and who he knew had two other children as well. There may have been good reasons for that (like Issy had proven during the marriage that she was bad with money, or prone to favoring her older sons), or there may have been bad reasons (like Dave and his family looking down on Issy for coming from a less well to do family, or just not caring what happened to her or her other children after she was no longer any use to Dave). \n\nIn any case, OP\u2019s family is certainly under no legal obligation to give her money (and OP is correct for saying the trust funds can only be used for their stated purpose). However, if all three kids are living with their mother, and OP\u2019s family is showering Miles with extravagant gifts while ignoring Miles\u2019s half brothers, there\u2019s just no way that\u2019s not going to lead to resentment and tension between them, which isn\u2019t good for any of them. Life doesn\u2019t have to be equal, but when possible it should be kind. For the sake of everyone involved, including Miles.", "I agree with this. I can\u2019t tell you how many years we brought presents for extended half-family kids just because we knew they wouldn\u2019t have much. Did we have to? Was it \u201cour job\u201d? No, it was just because we cared about some kids that were part of our family one way or another", "I felt this in my bones.\n\nMy mom and stepdad remarried and my stepdad's family was a lot more wealthier than what I was used to.\n\nMy mom and stepdad didn't even have kids but you had lots of nieces and nephews and we always said holidays with them.\n\nHis mom and his sisters always made sure to give us gifts even though we weren't blood related and we didn't even expect them. \n\nI can't imagine what it would be like to have a half brother and see them get gifts from their super wealthy family and have them not get us a single thing.\n\nI'm not saying that it's necessarily your job whether you guys are bad people for not doing it but it just seems wrong.\n\nI don't think you should be using miles money either, but I do feel like she was your brother's wife and I feel like your brother would want his step kids to have a good Christmas too.", "This was my takeaway. She married this man and has full custody seemingly. Has the extended family just never considered these kids grandchildren? Looks like he was in their lives for 8 or more years, so if they don\u2019t see their dad then OP\u2019s brother is the only dad they knew. Now they don\u2019t get Christmas presents and one of the kids gets showered with them? \n\nIf I\u2019m understanding this correctly, then ESH, Mom knows the rules and is in a really crappy position, and shouldn\u2019t have been lying to get to the funds. But- the family doesn\u2019t help their late son\u2019s wife who is a single mother of 3 at all? Seems disrespectful to his memory to not at least acknowledge the kids he helped raise.", "Yeah. He's describing a fucked up family dynamic.", "Honestly, if I found out that some stepkids were bullying my nephew \u2014 the only thing I had left of my dead brother \u2014 the only thing I would want to contribute to their Christmas is a case of salmonella for them to enjoy over their Christmas break.", "If his brother wanted the twins to have any money, he would have provided for them as carefully as he did Miles. OP has no obligation to do anything other than his brother's wishes. This is on the mom to take care of her twins. It's neither miles' not OP's responsibility.", "I don\u2019t know. Both my parents remarried and I NEVER got gifts from any step relatives.", "This! I hated going to my step mom\u2019s family\u2019s house for Christmas because I literally just sat there watching my half siblings open tons of gifts. It\u2019s really hard not to feel hurt and unwanted in that situation. However, I will always remember how nice her one sister was to get me a gift too. It wasn\u2019t super fancy or expensive (I think it was a lip smackers set and a journal), but just knowing someone thought of me so I wouldn\u2019t feel completely left out made a huge difference. \n\nIt sounds like OP\u2019s family is well off enough that a couple of extra small gifts won\u2019t break their budget and they\u2019re just kids. The family\u2019s attitude towards the half brothers are likely part of the reason they take it out on Miles. Is it their job to get them gifts? No, gifts aren\u2019t required for anyone.

You're asking OP to have that child choose between his Mom, whom I'm sure he loves, and a family member that has admitted there wasn't much contact prior to the father's death. Do you know the amount of mental distress this could cause that little boy? Not to mention that without some real proof of a just cause to remove him from his mother's care, a Judge isn't going to order it anyway. Would Family Services remove him with proof of the bullying? Probably not. They'd recommend individual & family counseling first. Obviously the bullying by the older siblings needs to stop but asking an 8 year old if he wants to leave his mother's care isn't the answer (and neither is the mother's \"solution\").

Did your brother have a relationship with Issys children? How long were they married? It seems odd to me that someone would marry someone with toddlers but not accept them as part of their family and also not leave a provision whatsoever for their widow and step-kids. There seems to be much more to this than just this current issue of xmas funds, especially if your nephew is well provided for by the trust. Could you allow your SIL a small loan? I can definitely see both sides to this. It\u2019s not an 8 year olds responsibility to provide for his siblings but at the same time, the amount of money to lend or allow to release to help her with xmas would likely be negligible and not cause a dent in the trust\u2026..At the same time, it\u2019s the principle. Especially if she has lied and manipulated before to get money. It will possibly open up future attempts/disagreements for accessing your nephews money on things that aren\u2019t for your nephew. Definitely a difficult situation. I don\u2019t think anyone is the AH here. If your brother was alive, would he want all 3 children to have the same things?

The kids are still pretty young: they're 11, they have no father, no family, and no Christmas gifts. They're probably too young to understand the situation and just see it as favouritism and that's going to be very damaging to all of them, Miles included.\n\nWhile I don't like how the mother is handling this, I wonder how is OP's family treating the twins (OP mentioned he has no relationship with them). It sounds like they could at least make an effort to be nicer, even if only for Miles' sake.", "Same here.

Sorry, I don't blame kids for their parents/the adults around them short comings. Does the bullying need to stop? Yup! But do I understand why it is happening? Also, yes. \n\nThe twins most likely saw Dave as their Dad as he was in their lives starting around 2 if not earlier depending on the timeline of dating/pregnancy/marriage. So they grow up with Dave and he dies. Sucks for everyone. Except Dave's family no longer interacts with anyone but their little brother. Everything got left to their brother so mom is now struggling because she is down to one income and the Trust doesn't cover any monthly expenses (should have SSI, but not sure how much). So now their life is significantly downgraded and their brother's isn't. Because the Trust sends him to private school and pays for uniforms. Because their stepfather's family still sends their brother nice things.\n\nNobody owes anyone anything, but everyone is grieving (which isn't easy) and the kids are acting out in fairly predictable ways.

I have a feeling this is a long history of her mismanging funds, whether she's actually favoring the twins often or just expected the husband/family funds to cover her ex's shortfalls. Dave was probably sick of it and wanted to make sure that if he died, his money would only be used for Miles, period.\n\nI do think it's shitty that there is no monthly stipend for living expenses. OP commented that there is no mortgage but the house is in trust, as well. Which means Miles can give her the boot when he comes of age. That's a huge burden off Issy now, but groceries and utilities still cost money.\n\nGiven her history of lying to secure extra money and spending it on other things (her other kids) I could see why Dave did what he did. But I'm frustrated that Issy didn't manage to budget for Christmas this year and clearly thought that having this conversation with OP where she was \"honest\" but tried to make OP feel badly for Miles by saying her other kids torment him and resent him due to the financial inequity is shitty. She thought this was going to work, and doesn't have a Plan B. \n\nI fully believe she makes shitty comments to and around her twins about the situation, especially when they complain about what Miles has that they don't. Kids shouldn't be privy to these kinds of details, but I'm sure she's irritated and frustrated that she didn't get a windfall or stipend and vocalizes it to them.\n\nNTA, OP. It sounds like you're doing your best with what your brother gave you guys. I'd consider setting up some counseling for Miles, take the cost out of the trust and explain to Issy that she has brought up concerning behavior by her other kids, as well as the fact Miles is growing up without his dad. I'd also talk with the counselor about how to manage these issues with Issy when they come up. I expect they're going to get worse, not better, especially as the kids get older and into their teenage years, and college starts coming closer. This isn't going to be a teneble situation if the widow can't get a handle on her finances and feelings about it, and stop both commenting on it to the kids and allowing her twins to take out their frustrations on Miles.

Instead Issy is short her husband\u2019s income, and the trust for her child only pays for the fancy stuff.

Where we live, our homeowners insurance has skyrocketed so much, along with our property tax doubling in the past two years, that we've had double mortgage payments to catch up for the last three months-which is great right before Christmas.

I know the trust said it was only supposed to be used to benefit you but\u2026\u201d. I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s justifiable", " This is a completely messed up situation. Your brother died, apparently with quite a lot of money, and instead of ensuring that his wife was cared for, he used it to control her and to create a fantastically unequal situation where his son lives a golden life while his widow and his stepchildren must watch from the sidelines and can't even beg for a handout. This must be absolutely horrible for Issy, let alone for her twin boys.\n\nYes, I get it, he left Issy a house that is totally paid off so she doesn't have to worry about rent.  But actually he didn't. He left **Miles** a house that is totally paid off and he left Issy with zip.  Unlike a normal wife and widow, Issy has no ownership of the house she shared with her husband. Unlike a normal wife and widow, she can't use equity in the house to pay for a degree in a field that would earn her more income, or find a job in another state that would pay more, or move closer to family that might help her with the kids, or downsize the house and release the equity to buy food and clothing for her children, or to do anything that would actually allow her to move up in life. Issy is being controlled and restricted, from the grave, by Dave. \n\nDave also did not get life insurance that could have helped Issy to recover and thrive after his death. Term life insurance is easy to get, inexpensive, and is designed for exactly such situations as this. In a normal marriage, the spouses are encouraged to each get term life insurance that would pay off the entire house if one partner died, so the other spouse would own that asset free and clear. Issy is not privileged because she lives in a paid off house, instead she has gotten far UNDER what a normal spouse would get here, because the house belongs to Miles, not herself.  Essentially, Dave has treated her, not like a wife, but like a maid for Miles.\n\nNow, sure, maybe Issy is a terrible person. Maybe she cheated on him. But there's no evidence of that in your post. Instead, all the evidence you have cited, suggests a man who treated his wife poorly and continues to do so from beyond the grave, and who also has ensured that her sons, his stepsons, have it shoved in their faces daily. All of what you describe as Issy \"extorting\" money is actually just Issy trying to recover from Dave's abnormal disinheritance of his own wife.\n\nOk, so now that we've analyzed all of that, let's move on to you. \n\nWhen Issy asks for money that you can't dispense, all you have to say is, \"Issy, I'm sorry, but I can't do that, it's against the terms of the trust and my hands are tied.\" There's nothing in the way you administer the trust that makes you the AH, because you have a legal obligation to administer the trust according to its terms. (I do wonder if you could disburse a monthly amount for Miles's food, but that's a minor issue in the big picture). \n\nOn the other hand.\n\nYou say that Issy is asking for this money because, after paying for essentials, she doesn't have money to buy Christmas presents for her other two kids. Clearly Issy is not living the high life, nor is she a spendthrift with her money. Considering that Dave made no provision for her in his estate, and that she has an admin job (and those usually don't pay very well), it's likely that Issy does indeed have nothing left over to buy gifts for her other two kids. Yet you frame this as if Issy is a gold-digger trying to live the high life off of the trust. Getting a few Christmas presents for her twins is not living the high life. \n\nYou say that Issy is trying to excuse her lack of parenting because her boys bully Miles. But actually, the person who created this situation is Dave. Dave engineered a situation where two young boys and their mother, have it thrown in their face every single day, that their half-brother is valuable, and they are not. Miles goes to prep school, has tech, sports, amazing Christmas gifts, anything he wants. The other two boys have to watch him get all that, while they have nothing, in their own home, every day. What exactly do you expect to happen here? You expect two small boys to be the \"bigger person\" when a grown man, Dave, has been so cruel and malicious towards them in such a calculated and ongoing way, that affects every day of their lives, and that they can't escape during their childhood, because they have to live with this other child?   The cause of any toxicity between Miles and the twins, is Dave. Don't blame it on Issy. Or on the twins. They've been treated like this since they were 8 years old, and probably before that too.\n\nHere is why I think you are the AH. Your family buys large Christmas presents for Miles, while Issy's other children get nothing. You don't have to use the money from the trust to give Issy to get her kids presents. You apparently have money to spare, why don't you just buy nice presents for her other children too? Why don't your whole family do that? You can't misuse the trust but there's nothing to stop you from being charitable towards Issy and the twins and instead you are treating her children in the same callous way as Dave did, and blaming them because your combined callousness, is making them hostile towards Miles.\n\nThe normal course of things in a marriage, even in a marriage with stepchildren, is that a wife and husband share equally in the fruits of the marriage, whether earned by him or her. You seem financially very competent, I cannot imagine you don't understand how unusual it is the way Dave has treated Issy leaving her with NOTHING from their marriage. Even if Dave planned to divorce Issy and happened to pass away before he could make legal moves to separate from her, the fact is that it is HIS choices have created a situation that is cruel and untenable to both Issy and her two older children, and utterly toxic to her ability to raise her three children in a healthy way.  \n\nYou have two choices. You can admit to Issy that Dave treated her like dirt and that, although you are restricted by the terms of the trust, you sympathize with her situation, and that you and your family will do everything that actually IS in your power to help her make ALL her children feel loved and valued, despite Dave's cruelty.\n\nOr you can do what you are doing now.\n\nYTA.", "Might be controversial, but the biggest AH here was your brother. Not leaving her ANY of the estate and making it so she can't use the money things like bills because he apparently hated his step-kids that much makes me wonder why he didn't just divorce in the first place.

As an executor of the trust, or at least as the person managing the funds, you have to make sure those funds are used appropriately, in line with the terms of the trust. I am quite sure that this does not include funds for the other kids.\n\nHowever, your question raises a lot bigger issues than the funds for a few xmas presents.  If Miles is bullied, and his mom is not actively managing this by - gosh! - setting boundaries and consequences for actions and misbehaviour for her other children, are there any other solutions here? What are you going to do about this? Because this is the real issue here. The money is also an issue, but it's a symption for a problem more than the problem itself.\n\nNTA - assuming you will do something about the bullying and the problems at his home beside managing the withdrawal and use of funds from his trust.", "A father setting up a trust for his son doesn't mean the father hated the wife.

She would also be receiving Social Security for Miles (not the others, as their father is still presumably alive). \n\nBut he had no life insurance for his spouse/family? That's odd, for someone who handled a trust and had a will and assets, versus someone who was struggling to afford the basics. \n\nCould be ragebait. I always just sort of take posts as being sincere, because people are weird and there are more things in heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in (our) philosophy, lol.", "It's also possible that although the house is \"free\" in the sense she's not paying to live in it, it's too expensive for her to run on a single income.  I don't think there's enough information here to make a sensible judgement.", "the house is paid off, she works & gets a child support check. so i\u2019m confused what you\u2019re implying & why miles\u2019 money is the solution.", "I\u2019m so sorry that all your relatives were AHs. Truly, I am.", "Does she get survivor benefits from the government for him?", "The completely paid off house, she and the twins are allowed to live in, but it's not even hers, it's part of the trust too. Even though she's the one looking after it and doing the day to day tasks in it.", "Miles *is* her kid too.  She should be trying to get the older kids to stop bullying the youngest, not looking for handouts from the youngest child\u2019s trust.  Sounds like she couldn\u2019t hold onto a dollar even if it was tattooed to her ass.\nEdit:  NTA.", "They aren\u2019t in the states, death benefits aren\u2019t a thing everywhere. I don\u2019t even know what death benefits are (not American)!", "If the house is in trust, it\u2019s likely she doesn\u2019t own it or have any obligations to it in any way. The trust likely pays the taxes.\n\nThat said, houses cost more in utilities. They have repair costs and landscaping fees. Food, clothing, barbers, etc in a HCOL area cost more. Stores may be less willing to accept benefits. You may need a car and gas to get places. And kids are expensive. I could easily see someone with a low income job struggling just living in a more gentrified area.", "Wouldn\u2019t the trust pay the taxes?", "He didn't left her the house, the house is Miles's and is in the trust.", ">She gets a child support check\n\nThat is not in the post and I haven\u2019t seen a comment to that effect. In fact OP has said the opposite, that ALL of her brothers assets are in trust for Miles. So where are you getting this?", "This!", "That would probably be from the trust as well.  \u201cHi we dont have air con, please fix for child\u201d", "Why would she be responsible for any of that, it is in a trust to his child. Likely the property taxes and any major repairs would come from the trust on the child's future asset they wouldn't just let it fall into disrepair or be appropriated by the government for non tax payment.. At best she is probably responsible for regular living expenses like would be expected of any mother.", "This is what I was thinking. I own my own house and repairs as well as utilities are a killer.  My heating and electric is almost $400 a month alone. That doesn't factor the property tax I have to pay. I pray every day that something else doesn't break down as I've already had to deal with several repairs. I don't have kids but I can't imagine looking after three children would be cheap.", "Right?! People are acting like a paid for house means the house wants any maintenance. The widow is basically footing the bill for everything, the house, and bills, food, and the money for Miles isn't paying for any of his needs.", "When setting up the trust he would have had to specify the beneficiaries. Any good lawyer is going to ask whether he wants to treat his bio kid and his step kids differently in that process. And for sure is going to point out that if he included the steps and he got divorced they would still receive his money unless he immediately changed his estate papers at that time (assuming it was a revocable trust - he would not be able to change an irrevocable trust after its creation).", "Why would leave money for the kids that aren't his and take money away from his own? Their father pays child support. They would have more than his child in that case. I don't understand why you think that he shouldn't have put his own child as his priority. The other children have a living father.", "According to other people responses, yes. So, today I learned something.", "Hmm. Sounds like he and his wife were heading for a split.", "He said in a comment she gets child support for the twins", "Miles is 8. It isn\u2019t time to \u201cdial back\u201d his gifts yet. He probably still believes Santa and plays with toys.", "Yeah all these people saying OP is the AH aren\u2019t accounting for the home that mom and SK\u2019s are living in rent free.", "A trust should pay for basic maintenance. Most trusts have provisions to keep any property in trust maintained. It sounds like this trust was very well set up so I can't imagine the trust letting the house go to ruin.", "If they are in the US, and if he paid into it.  Fun fact, teachers in my state don\u2019t pay into social security.  There is a teacher\u2019s retirement fund (that our government dipped into and left retiring teachers without the benefits they were supposed to receive).", "OP is his sister.", "OP said that the kids don't see their bio father. And judging from the ages, Dave has been in these kids' lives since they were toddlers (maybe even babies) and has been the only father figure they've known. So yes, it is strange to me he didn't at least leave them something.  \nETA - this could also explain some of the resentment between the siblings. The only father figure they've ever known obviously didn't consider them his at all.", "He'd being bullied in his own home. Having smaller toys is better than a fresh round of that.", "That is true in many places.  It\u2019s been a few decades since I last rented.  I just know that property taxes, insurance, and repairs/replacements add up to a significant amount.", "The house is paid off which is probably a reasonable replacement for that. Housing costs are ridiculous so not having a rent or mortgage payment is fantastic.", "You do realize that\u2019s something they go over when the will was read/when she started using the trust. Also the trust/OP pays for their housing, miles schooling/school supplies, clothes, tech, anything miles needs within reason obviously. BUT having a child is a shared responsibility, I don\u2019t think buying the kid food and paying utilities is really that hard on mom (especially isn\u2019t it\u2019s less than 50% so the financial responsibility isn\u2019t split equally)"]}
