You said that now you don't trust her not to cheat because of her insisting on hanging up his picture, and she just heard that because she slept with someone before you, you think she's going to cheat on you (because that is technically what you said). Yes, she could just be going there to be emotionally manipulative, but she could also be genuinely hurt by the implication.\n\nYou need to sit her down and explain that you don't think she's a slut or that she's a cheater and that you don't care about the fact that she had a relationship with this man in the past.

They might have a small photo of the late spouse on a desk per someone like that.", "NTA", "If it\u2019s truly for the kids, a reasonable compromise would be to put up photos of the wedding in the kid\u2019s area /bedroom, or give them a wedding album. Not having wedding photos with the ex in your public areas seems like a reasonable limit.", "NTA. I was the woman in this situation and it was not at all difficult to get rid of those photos because I harbor zero lingering feelings for or about my ex. My daughter kept the 1 photo she wanted, which is in her room, and the rest are in storage in case she wants them in the future. In case of a fire, they're at the bottom of my list of things to save. \n\nIt seems totally reasonable that you don't want to stare at photos of your STB wife on the day she married the last guy. What's her plan after your wedding, put up BOTH photos? That's weird. Also, wouldn't those photos just remind the kids that their parents USED TO love each other and now they don't? Or imply there's a chance they could again in the future?\n\nJust ask the kids which ones they want and store the rest.", "Ooooh that reaction. \n\nI'm guessing she's already cheated", "NTA at all.\n\nYou sound completely reasonable. A few photos with him and the kids or special memories, awesome. But there is NO reason for her to be hanging her wedding photos in your house. If anything, it will be confusing for the kids to still view them as a couple.", "NTA. Wedding photos is crossing a line.\n\nHaving a serial cheater for a brother and been cheated on myself - if \"cheating\" is the first thing she jumps to, it's on her mind for some reason.\n\nProceed with caution but stand firm. Family photos are fine, healthy for the kids - but couple photos are not.", "NTA it sounds like she has cheated on you with him...please for the love of God leave her. You are better than taking care of another dudes kids while your wife is likely screwing him.", "NTA. Mostly. I was leaning towards understanding your fiance's position until you mentioned she's hanging WEDDING photos. In my opinion, that's not cool. I can understand having photos of dad with the kids around, but not the wedding. Maybe you could talk about this aspect and form a compromise? Keep like picnic photos (for example) but put away the old wedding ones?", "NTA.\n\nYou put up wedding pictures when you wish to celebrate a marriage. If she still wishes to celebrate her marriage with her ex, then you both really need to reassess your engagement.\n\nDefinite red flag, and you are definitely justified in drawing a hard boundary here.", "Hang pictures of the kids with dad that\u2019s ok\u2026.but wedding photos and the fact that she jumped to cheating that\u2019s wild that\u2019s a big hell no.", "I'm willing to bet if you give this some thought, you'll realize that you've been ignoring a lot of other red flags with her. NTA.", "Nta, pretty sure she\u2019s already cheating based off her defensiveness", "My opinion : FUUUUUCCCCKKK NOOOO", "NTA. Had me with the title tho ngl. \n\nLike others have said: family pics are fine but old wedding photos are not. She projecting her guilt onto you, whether she\u2019s done something with her ex or is thinking about it is anyones guess. \n\nHow old are the kids? If you have been together this long surely the kids understand you\u2019re not a replacement father, especially if their father is still regularly in their life. \n\nThe fact that she jumped to such insane conclusions unprompted then immediately tried backpedaling is worrying. Her then switching the rolls so she\u2019s the victim (you \u2018slut shaming\u2019 her) and you\u2019re the bad guy (your \u2018jealousy\u2019 problems) is more worrisome. Is that a common occurrence in fights? \n\nEither way I\u2019d say now is a good a time as any to sit down and think back over every single disagreement/fight/argument you\u2019ve had in the past (especially if it involves ex) before going forward. Might save some confusion and heartbreak down the line.", "She protests too much I think", "She's hanging the wedding picture with her ex-husband in your house?  You're attempting to be in a relationship with someone who isn't available to be in one.  \n\nMove her and her kids back to her old man's house.  The fact that she brings up cheating on you with him tells you that she has that in the forefront of her mind.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nWanting photos of the kids w their dad in their rooms, and maybe one in the living room is fine as he is the kids dad. \n\nBut WEDDING PHOTOS?! Heeeeeeell no.\n\nThe fact that she jumped right to saying you\u2019re accusing her of cheating with him is a HUGE RED FLAG. \n\nI\u2019d be rethinking this whole thing buddy.", "That was my thinking. When I read the title I assumed she'd be trying to hang old family photos but wedding photos...", "I'm starting to feel that she's not over the divorce and I'm scared that she might cheat with him if given the chance to tbh", "Any divorced friends I have literally burned their wedding photos. I can't even fathom the idea of someone putting up wedding photos from their failed marriage in their house with their new partner.", "Agreed. At the very most, she could have put up a wedding photo in her kids bedroom if it was actually for them and not her. I would reconsider this engagement OP.", "It's very weird that she jumped straight to it, and then she got mad when I questioned it.", "Yeah, I have to agree here. The \"slut shaming\" thing comes so far out of left field. It's literally not a part of the discussion until she brings it up, so you have to question *why* it's suddenly brought up.", "And then she doesn't want the kids to think she's \"replacing\" their dad. If she's so concerned about that, why is she marrying someone else at all?", "Yeah her wildly over reacting and escalating the situation so the discussion is on something else entirely is a massive red flag. \nIt\u2019s manipulative and it effectively switches things so you\u2019ve to defend yourself from her wild accusation rather than having a reasonable discussion.\nThe kids having pics of their dad in their rooms, fine, that\u2019s good for them. \nSome family pics in common areas, kinda ok but wouldn\u2019t be front and center. Wedding pics for the two of them? Hell no.\n\nNTA. Your fianc\u00e9 is not over her ex. And even if she was this behavior is widely inappropriate and her way of addressing this issue is to be manipulative and twist it into you being the bad guy.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an outlandish conclusion for her draw. If someone accuses you of not being over someone that is still actively a part of your life, cheating accusations aren\u2019t that far behind. I would imagine many people would respond to his accusation with something like \u201cDo you think I\u2019d cheat on you?\u201d  But I still think it\u2019s odd that the pictures she wants hung up are wedding photos. I thought it\u2019d be more of a generic family photo.", "I want to marry her but not if she's not over her last marriage. I was under the impression that she was in fact over it but maybe we should slow down a bit", "[removed]", "He was cheating and is currently dating his AP, he wanted the divorce too", "And to be fair, pictures of the family with the ex should be restricted to the kids' bedrooms.", "The oldest is in one, yes, the other two she wants to hang is just them", "I'm not sure tbh, I don't normally talk to him when he picks the kids", "I don't have photos of my exes in the walls, why would she?", "People have pasts. OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t appear to have let go of hers.\n\nMore evidence is his comment later down that the husband cheated and initiated the divorce to be with his AP. OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 hasn\u2019t come to terms with the end of her old marriage and isn\u2019t ready for a new one.", "But OP wasn't worried until the fianc\u00e9 came to that conclusion out of left field from him not wanting wedding photos hung up. Seems like she is projecting a little bit and is afraid that she might cheat with the ex if given the opportunity....", "I don\u2019t agree with a wedding photo being appropriate to have hanging in a common area. But everything else you said I Agree!! \n\nI said the same thing in regards that these two need premarital counseling and should not get married let alone live together, how do you not have these types of conversations prior to moving in especially when kids are involved? \n\nI cannot imagine what other convos they haven\u2019t had and they both don\u2019t sound ready. Her jumping to extreme conclusions, him too, her leaving, the fighting, him being concerned she will cheat, it\u2019s all bad and I cannot keep up with all the red flags.", "But the dad is not dead and it's not about the pictures with the kids I'm complaining about, it's about their wedding photos.", "I think I have the right to make a big deal out of this because it's my house", "Yeah, family photos when kids are involved is absolutely fine. The wedding wasn\u2019t about the kids, so that is beyond weird unless the kids are in the photo as well (which is not mentioned)", "Yeah same or maybe the marriage with the ex ended due to death.", "It\u2019s weird that she used the term \u201cslut shaming.\u201d Either she doesn\u2019t understand what that means or it was a slip.", "You might be right. She may still have some feelings tied to that connection but the worrying about cheating is rooted within your own insecurity.", "Did you accuse her of this or did she bizarrely just deny it out of nowhere? Who denies things they haven't been accused of???", "OP, it sounds like she already is cheating. Probably physically too, but definitely emotionally.", "NTA. I believe by going immediately to cheating, she is already doing that. She told you what she is doing.", "Opportunity creates a thief", "She's either projecting or gaslighting, either way it's not good.", "Just wait until she starts talking about how her ex did things differently in bed, but she slips up and uses present tense.", "NTA. How in the flying fuck cant she understand you dont want to see the face of her ex every day in your own home? Plus you have the heart to welcome her AND HER THREE KIDS to live with you (because baby daddy cant be fucking bothered to take the kids to live with him aparently), and she cant compromise on this bullshit? And that slut shaming shit? I think it could be projection, and maybe there is something going on between her and her ex.\n\nThis is gonna sound harsh, but just run. Hit the \"fuck go back\" button and just leave her. All of this its just to shady", "Run, run very fast & don't look back.\nSo many red flags there.", "Right? Either some info is missing here or this lady has got some underlying guilt, bc I don't see how we got from \"married to a guy previously\" to \"slut shaming\"", "Why? It's to change the argument to put him on the backfoot by now defending himself over something not said.", "NTA op but plsssss think of this and pause EVERYTHING!!", "The fact that she immediately jumped to you assuming she would cheat with him, is a strong indicator she's at the very least thought about it. At minimum she's testing boundaries to see what she can get away with in the relationship, which is a major red flag.", "Her reaction to this is somewhat telling.", "Do you know why they divorced and how long it\u2019s been?", "Just pure curiosity. Seeing as she & her kids have moved in with you, will there be any legal responsibilty you have towards her kids or her claims on your house in the long run?", "Who initiated the divorce?", "I mean I wanted to be sensitive. Lmao but agree", "She isn't over him. You're a placeholder, man...\n\n\nNTA", "This answer needs to be much higher. HE cheated on her, HE wanted the divorce, HE is dating his AP BUT SHE is hanging wedding photos with just the 2 of them?? Mate you need to think really hard about whether or not you want to marry her. And I agree with the person who said you're a placeholder because you are. She wants the wedding photos up so the kids won't get confused?? What about when both of you hang photos from your own wedding?!?! This entire situation is suss as fuck.", "That\u2019s not about the kids.", "You\u2019re in for big trouble", "Do you know why they divorced? Maybe she din't want to divorce...", "Well, I kinda understand if the kids were a part of it. The ones with just them is a little weird tho. \n\nI wouldn't jump straight to her cheating/not having moved on though. Maybe she just looks really awesome in her wedding dress? I still have pictures in my phone with an ex because they're great pictures of me. Maybe it's an important family memory to her? I mean your wedding is supposed to be your big princess memory? \n\nYou're NTA for not wanting to hang them though. This guy is going to be a co parent and part of your life long-term. It's okay to make sure, and to have clear boundaries.", "It was weird before that she wanted photos, but their wedding photos yeah no that\u2019s not normal", "No, he's still alive. In the post it says that they divorced 3 years ago and he's still active in their kids lives.", "Me thinks she knows exactly what it means.", "She just got the impression I was accusing her of such because I have jealousy issues according to her", "I agree, to me it seems like a failed attempt at gaslighting OP. Then she got defensive bc OP realised what she was doing and called out...\n\nNTA. Family photos (daddy included) all fine and dandy, legit. Ex husband wedding pictures... RED FLAG.", "As the Bible says: \"The guilty flee when no man pursueth.\"", "They got divorced three years ago and she\u2019s engaged. They might have been separated way before the divorce but it seems OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9e jumped too fast to another relationship. Especially another future marriage. \n\nShe very well could not be over her ex- not completely.", "Absolutely. And what is there for the kids to get confused about exactly? They understand that their parents are no longer together. If anything the wedding pictures would be more confusing. As a kid of divorced parents it\u2019s honestly weird to see their wedding pictures.", "He was cheating, that's why they got divorced", "But why hang them if it was just bc she looks nice? She can still look at them in a album or social media for the memories. He is not asking to delete/burn them just not put the celebration pics of her and the ex relationship on his home.", "I know. I meant when I read the title before reading anything else.", "We don't have enough info to know. Maybe you are a bit jealous and she could be justified to make this jump. But I give you the benefit of the doubt because while she does need to co-parent with the guy and get along with him, it's utterly essential to also show your new fiance that the old marriage is completely over. I would die on this hill.", "May want to file that under gaslighting", "This is where I\u2019m at. The old family photos show not getting a replacement dad. \n\nBut an old wedding photo? Lady, you and he are divorced. Either she didn\u2019t want him or he didn\u2019t want her. Either way that ship has long sailed, and isn\u2019t coming back and those photos should be toast.", "Ah, thanks for the info. I find even more weird she would want the pics of the day he vowed to be faithfull on display.\n\nMaybe they nice pics like other comment said. Talk to her that you find insulting to your relantionship and that you already ok with photos with the kids and him bc his is the father but she should compromise and not put the ones that bother you in your home to everybody to see. Shes free to show them in a album to the kis if this is about them. If she refuses is a big red flag.\n\nThe fact she jumps to the idea of her cheating is also a red flag, she either jumped to the topic bc is something that happened in her last relantionship or bc she thought about being with the ex again.", "Yeah I don't think she's over it dude. I'm not saying to walk away completely,  but the brakes need to be pumped hard.", "Yeah, I don't think he's being unfair at all. I'm just saying, trust your partner and don't assume this is about feelings for the ex when there could be innocent (but tone deaf) reasons for a thing.", "BS, we have enough info, one thing is the family picture i can understand that for the sake of getting along with the coparent, but the picture of the wedding, wtf??.. of course someone is going to be jealous of that, he have many good reasons to not trust her. NTA."]}
