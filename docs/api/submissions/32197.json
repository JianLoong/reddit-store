There was no activity going on that would require that response.\n\nWere you in a rush? Was there some reason that your sister could not spend some time with her niece? If they had spent that time drawing on placemats together, it still would have been time spent together.

Do better because you are setting her up to fail.", "OP is raising their kid according to developmental ability, and I accord with related science. You CANT force a kid to toilet train before they're ready. it's literally not biologically possible", "She already toilet trained because she was ready. I plan to homeschool anyways!", "i never said you could, however if op, or any parent really in this situation, isn\u2019t being proactive about training- then the kid will never be ready. \n\nthanks though!", "the kid in question is 3.5 years old.  that is typically older than a majority of kids who are already fully potty trained.  \n\n\nand if it is supposedly \"biologically impossible\"........ then please tell me how there are many places in the world that regularly have their kids potty trained at an even earlier age than most western cultures do?", "Oh, you\u2019re one of THOSE \u201cparents\u201d \ud83d\ude44", "Why do you ask for opinions if you\u2019re going to completely disregard them? Especially when 99% of people think you\u2019re being moronic. Pretty worthless post if your mind is already made up, but then again, not very surprising somebody with this mindset has nothing better to do like maybe\u2026 parenting their child?", "My cousin was raised the same way you're doing it right now and she is 17 and unable to go out in public without her mom next to her, can't drive, only eats a handful of foods and refuses to socialize with others. You are setting your child up for failure.", ">  I plan to homeschool anyways!\n\n1. Why?\n\n2. What are your qualifications for doing that?", "So an education that will be down to when the child is ready?", "You should not homeschool your child if you are not willing to teach her developmentally-appropriate skills until she \"decides she is ready.\" You're going to severely stunt your daughter's education and cause her a lot of issues as an adult.", "Of course you do...", "Great. Homeschooling for the kid after you already won't teach her basic manners and how to use eating utensils.  I'm sure that won't end up messing her up in the long run.  I feel for her development.", "Ohhhh lord. Good luck to your daughter. She'll need it.", "Please don't. You're screwing over your kid's future.", "I am an advocate for homeschooling. I was homeschooled. I homeschooled both of my children when they needed a break from public school. I spent 7 years teaching people how to select curriculum, educate their children well at home and stay within legal and educational guidelines. \n\nBut I also witnessed train wrecks. I watched kids receive no education at all or develop no social or real-life skills, who now struggle as adults. The success of homeschooling depends very much upon the parent. Just from your responses here, OP, I would suggest that you find a more structured school option. Because if *you* aren't enforcing any structure, she will not learn what she needs to learn, and you will have failed her as a parent and as a teacher. \n\nYTA.", "Yikes", "Please dont homeschool your kid. I dont think you have the education or the maturity to do so.", "Ah this makes sense now. LOL", "I used to work for a college and a parent called and asked if we would make peanut butter and jellies for their child.  You are going to he that parent, it is called learned helplessness", "Oh your poor daughter...", "> even earlier age than most western cultures do?\n\nand let us not forget, the West USED to manage earlier. And then came along a plague of parents like OP", "Because I was wondering if I was too harsh with my sister", ">unable to go out in public without her mom next to her\n\nSomething tells me OP will consider this a gOoD tHiNg", "She can\u2019t teach her kid to use cutlery so I\u2019m sure the napoleonic war is going to be easypeasy!", "In some states, the only qualifications you need are a high school diploma/GED and teach 180 days out of the year. In others, you don\u2019t need ANY qualifications. The bar is really low unfortunately.", "i personally felt like a temporary parental failure during the potty training of my own kid, because it was a tad later than other typical kids by about 6 months.  \n\n\nbut i sure as heck had my kid fully potty trained by 3.5 years old!", "No, you just want someone to pat you on the back and say you're doing the right thing. Then you won't have to face the reality that you're acting like a fool and need to step up as a parent.", "> napoleonic war is going to be easypeasy!\n\nThat was at Waterloops, yes?", "Right?!", "I know, it's absurd."]}
