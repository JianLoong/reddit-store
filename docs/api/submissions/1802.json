I also live with my grandparents and older brother. We have a lot of dogs (around 9 or so) and it has become a thing apparently to just put dogs that they don\u2019t want to watch overnight in my bedroom while I\u2019m at work, I work overnights for a local warehouse, and this is the 4th time a dog has just destroyed my whole room. Yesterday when I got home I just wanted to wind down and take a shower and go to bed, only to find a pile of shit and puddle of piss in my floor, and my clothing rack, which also has shelves that hold a lot of my personal belongings, knocked over on the ground, along with my brothers dog, Honey. I promptly kicked her out and spent 3-4 hours cleaning up the mess and told my mom what had happened. I asked her to make sure she didn\u2019t go in my room last night, well when I get home the exact same scenario happened. I then texted her saying \u201cI\u2019m done with this shit I asked y\u2019all not to put her in here, all of that work I just did yesterday is just gone, thanks.\u201d Now she\u2019s upset at me for talking to her like that but I feel like it\u2019s pretty deserved, I pay 200 a month to live here and this is the 4th time this has happened with my brothers dogs, I\u2019ve had to watch two of his other puppies before and after they destroyed my room I told my family and same exact thing, after the second time I only watch his puppies when I\u2019m here.

While it is her home and you can't really control what she does in her own home, this is inconsiderate to you and the dogs. Why are there so many dogs? Why are they not taking care of the dogs?

Fully trained dogs don't destroy things if left alone. And why do they decide this dog needs to be put where they don't have to deal with it? I doubt it's because she's so well trained.\n\nI understand getting defensive but these dogs need to be crate trained and put in a crate instead of your room if they don't want to deal with it.

He didn't get into anything, no accidents on the floor, nothing. Hell the few times he's thrown up he looked horrified that he made a mess.
