I asked her who do she think she is coming into MY room that's been mine since the day I was born to tell me that I should move out and that she should send one of her kids to go live with their father since she's so worried about space. I then told her to gth out of my room before I get really disrespectful. Then later today my dad came into my room to talk to me about the conversation between my step mom and me.

That womans got evil Disney stepmom vibes.", "NTA. Stepmom sure has some nerve telling you to move out so her son can have your room. I'm glad that your dad is on your side :) I've seen plenty of stories where the kid isn't so lucky. You should ask your dad if you can get a lock on your door. To protect your privacy & your room. Just in case she tries to pull a fast one.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry you had to deal with that. It\u2019s YOUR room. You grew up there and were there long before she was ever in the picture.", "NTA\n\nI love itbwhen the person who is totally out if line and selfish says that the response to them is rude. Of course you were rude...she tried to kick you out of your damn home.\n\nI am so glad you dad is on your side...that woman  has eyes on the prize of inheriting that home and banishing you from her life.\n\nThis is phase 1...be prepared for the rest.", "NTA.

She had an unreasonable request, you gave a reasonable alternate solution, and asked her to leave you alone. Since you are an adult, all of this was within your rights.", "NTA. And even though you were rude to her and probably could have handled it better (you're a kid), she deserved it for asking you that. She is the AH.", "Good Lord, I hope your dad doesn't buckle under her pressure. You did just fine. What a horrible woman, doing this while your dad was gone. Get ready for round two. These self centered AHs seldom stop at one try. I hope she sees your post. Best of luck young lady, your gonna need it. ( I might  sound harsh but been there. Watch out that she doesn't try to get him to sign a wall that excludes you from everything.)", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, she needed to hear some harsh words.", "Your stepmother is the AH.

Please make sure that room is locked when you're out of the house.\n\nTry to be as civil as you can with SM's boys -- this was her idea, no point taking it out on them. \n\nNTA, stand your ground", "NTA\n\nHer being an adult does not give her the right to say whatever she likes with impunity.
