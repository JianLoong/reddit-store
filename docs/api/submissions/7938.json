{"id": 7938, "submission_id": "10i4h6c", "title": "AITA for yelling at my roommate to shut up while she was facetiming her family?", "selftext": "I F20 live in a shared house with four roommates. \n\nOne of my roommates \"Jane\" F29 is an immigrant and migrated to our country around 4 years ago because of better job opportunities. Jane moved in around 3 months ago to replace one of our old roommates who left after her lease with the landlord was up.\n\nJane and I haven't butted heads before until this issue came up. \n\nJane's family members are still living in her native country which is in another time zone, and Jane frequently facetimes them when it's very late at night for us, like 2 or 3am. She doesn't do it every night, but often enough for it to be annoying. Maybe four times a week?\n\nShe always does this in the kitchen or living room, and she and her family members are always extremely loud when talking to each other. \n\nI've talked to Jane and asked that she's more considerate about the noise and maybe wears headphones, but she's refused and said that headphones ruin the experience. I suggested she facetime during the day but she said her family will be asleep. \n\nI asked her to please just try to be quieter as her facetiming her family wakes me up and I have to get up early for work. She seemed to understand but didn't seem eager to fix the problem and kept changing the subject after that.\n\nEarlier this week, I had a zoom interview for a really exciting internship that would be helpful for my career. It was in the morning and I made my roommates aware around a week in advance just to ensure the house would be quiet and I could get a good night's sleep and an uninterrupted interview.\n\nThe night before the interview at around midnight, Jane is very loudly facetiming her family in the living room. I'm woken up and obviously not happy about it. I ask Jane to please keep it down and she said she would that she's just saying goodbye to them. \n\nThey went quiet for around 10 minutes but then I can hear them shrieking at each other again. I ask Jane AGAIN to please keep it down and stressed that I have to get up early. She promises she'll be quiet and apologises.\n\nThen at around 1am, I'm woken up again by Jane and her family. At this point, I'm incredibly done. I went downstairs and I yelled at Jane. I said \"SHUT THE F*** UP! SOME OF US ARE TRYING TO SLEEP!\". Jane's family hung up on the call when they heard me yell and Jane started crying and ran to her bedroom and shut herself in there.\n\nJane is really upset with me because I yelled at her and won't even look at me. She said she just misses her family and that I should have more empathy for her situation. My other roommates said I was being way too harsh on her. I feel conflicted. I feel guilty for yelling at her but at the same time I'm very frustrated with her for being disruptive.", "created_utc": 1674342499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10i4h6c/aita_for_yelling_at_my_roommate_to_shut_up_while/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not okay for her to call and wake her family up, but it's okay for her to screech at 1-3am and wake her roommates up? Does she not see the hypocrisy here?", "NTA.\n\nNot just you she has to be considerate to, she has to be considerate to the other neighbors. She is being loud at 1 in the morning, these are times where people are sleep. You tried talking to her about it and being polite but she refuses to listen. There is so much someone can take until being polite isn\u2019t an option anymore\n\n>I\u2019ve talked to Jane and asked that she's more considerate about the noise and maybe wears headphones, but she's refused and said that headphones ruin the experience.\n\nA very reasonable request, a reasonable solution, and a reason of refusal that makes no sense at all. How does wearing headphones \"ruin the experience\"?", "When diplomacy fails, it's time to go nuclear.\n\nNTA", "Noise levels should be low enough to sleep comfortably after midnight, especially on weekdays. You asked her nicely several times and even proposed solutions (e.g. headphones) but Jane continued to be uncompromising and rude. Talk this through with all roommates present. **NTA**", "NTA. You warned, you asked, one night of quiet is not too much to ask. Furthermore she made promises and then broke them. She moved for job opportunities, she should understand the value of one for you.", "NTA, she's been asksd multiple times to be considerate of others, refusing to wear headphones is an arsehole move in itself. If she doesn't want to have to be considerate of others then she should be living on her own", "NTA \n\nNot ideal to yell but you\u2019ve asked her nicely several times and she\u2019s ignored you.", "Nta if she\u2019s being that loud that late she should talk in her bedroom. You asked her politely twice.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to be polite. When that doesn't work, being rude is okay.", "NTA\n\nYou gave sufficient warning that you needed some quiet hours, but moving forward you guys need to come to an agreement on when Jane can hold these calls. I'm sure it sucks being away from your family and in a different time zone, but if they miss her too, they can take turns upending their lives to talk to her. She's just playing the \"new and lonely\" card; she needs to realize that your lives don't revolve around hers or she needs to move in with people who work third shift jobs where she won't be disrupting the house.", "Nta sometimes people need to be yelled at", "Jane's an adult, she doesn't get to act like a dumb college freshman. She can't control the timezones -- she CAN control how she acts in a shared house. Unfortunately some people don't take you seriously until you yell at them. Do the other 3 housemates not have a problem with her, or are they just afraid of looking offensive?", "NTA, you've being considerate by not making a big issue of it most of the time. Asking her to use headphones or keep the volume down is very reasonable, particularly if you have something specific you've warned her about.", "NTA. I was ready to say that you shouldn't speak to your roommate that way, but you did speak to your roommate a different way. You tried being nice about it, and she wouldn't be quiet. She wouldn't move, she wouldn't put on headphones. It is a her problem and not a you problem, and you've made that clear. If she wants to facetime at full volume at all hours with her family, she should pay for a space to do so where it doesn't effect others.", "NTA,  Why can't she use headphones?", "NTA You have given warning when you needed quiet time, you have asked repeatedly, and suggested headphones. Your roommate doesn't give a shit. It is all about her, and her needs. She is unwilling to compromise. \n\nApartments sometimes have set quiet hours.  In general, quiet hours fall between 10 PM to 7 AM on weekdays, and 10 PM to 8 AM or 9 AM on weekends. It is a good policy for everyone. People can be very inconsiderate. It is best to set rules at the start.\n\nYou might want to discuss with your roommates a similar rule so that everyone has the expectations. It is unfair for everyone to suffer for one person.", "NTA. Yelling was not your first solution; it was your *last* solution, the result of you being sleep-deprived because Jane repeatedly ignored the other roommates' needs & absolutely refused to entertain any reasonable solution, like wearing headphones. Sleep deprivation is internationally recognized as a form of torture, so it's no wonder you finally snapped at her.", "NTA. What is with these roommates and their hatred of headphones?", "Being polite didn't work. So you tried something else. It worked.\n\nNTA", "NTA - You asked her repeatedly and she chose to ignore it.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nYou've had several talks with her about this, asking nicely for her to be quieter and given her chance after chance. She ignores this completely and disregards everyone else in the house by being extremely loud. She knows that 1am isn't a reasonable time to be out in the main living area being loud and obnoxious with her family. She doesn't care. \r  \n\r  \nEveryone has their breaking point and you reached yours. maybe her family will now get a clue at how rude she's been to everyone in the house.", "NTA. She's being extremely rude and should know better at 29 that living with roommates means compromising with headphones. While Jane can't help the time zones she can try and mitigate the sound issue easily.", "NTA. Why can't she also have the calls in her room with the door closed to be less disruptive to others? Am I missing something here? Also the headphone thing makes literally no sense.", "NTA and now, by trial and error, you found the formula to put an end to this! Next time it happens, come in like a screaming banshee.", "NTA - she is very entitled", "NTA.  Your reaction was justified as you tried to find a minimally confrontational way to deal with the problem several times, while being ignored.  \n\nSome people only respond to verbal threats and implied violence.  I wish it wasn\u2019t this way, but some people will walk all over you until they find out they can\u2019t anymore.  I would have reacted in a similar fashion.", "NTA. She is 29. Twenty-NINE! I think I'd be more generous toward her homesickness if she were your young age, but she's not. She is a fully grown adult. The level of inconsideration and clinginess is a but alarming for someone her age, if I'm being honest. It's pretty odd that her roomie 9 years her junior is more responsible and respectful than her by such a large measure!", "NTA\n\nYou tried everything to resolve it nicely. She has no excuse. \n\nShe knew she was loud, she knew it was 1am, she knew it was keeping you awake.\n\nShe just did not care, no matter how many times you asked her nicely. \n\nShe only cared when you yelled. You did what you had to do to make her respect your reasonable request, no more and no less.", "NTA. Why can\u2019t she FaceTime in her bedroom??", "Nta. Jane needs to learn \"empathy\" for the people she lives with and how her behavior affects them. \"I dOnT lIkE hEaDpHoNeS\"... so effing what?! That doesn't entitle her to negatively affect everyone around her. You didn't tell her not to talk to her family. You asked her to be considerate. Omg... how dare you... /s", "NTA\n\n\"Jane is really upset with me because I yelled at her and won't even look at me.\"\n\nGood. Hopefully she'll remember this incident for a very long time after she dares to look at you again.\n\nShe has given you a read receipt that your message was sent and delivered.\n\n\"She said she just misses her family and that I should have more empathy for her situation. My other roommates said I was being way too harsh on her.\"\n\nWell, fine, I'll put it another way: if the leader's needs aren't met, the team's needs cannot be met. Yes, I know, you're all co-equal partners. You can't give empathy and support if you don't have what you need. You have stated your needs multiple times, and informed Jane that this particular evening was just before an extremely important event in which you had to be your best. You then gave her not one, but two requests to keep it down. These things are give-and-take by necessity: if your partners don't give, you have no choice but to take.", "From now on, every time she\u2019s loud, you yell at her. And keep on yelling at her until she sorts herself out. Do not let her have a peaceful \u201cloud conversation \u201c with her family until they learn that they are inconsiderate assholes. You might become an asshole, but the other person might learn a valuable lesson. And if they do, then it\u2019ll be peaceful. \n\nDon\u2019t think that you\u2019re being too harsh. These kind of people expect others to be considerate of them but they do not reciprocate. Also, I\u2019m an immigrant myself. I understand connecting with the family that\u2019s in a complete opposite time zone. However, I do it in a way that is not disturbing my roommates peace.", "NTA. If you heard yelling in the background, it was me yelling at them with you!", "NTA \n\nYou all share a space, nobody should be annoying in the open space everyone shares. It\u2019s like dirtying up the bathroom even though we all share it", "OMG. I\u2019m so glad her family heard it. Everybody deserved that wrath\ud83d\ude21", "NTA why the hell isn\u2019t she wearing headphones?", "NTA you said multiple times and even ahead of time about you needed sleep and this important interview but she was not only doing anything to at least lower the noise she just kept being loud that very night.\n\nHeadphones Do not ruin the experience, hell it makes the experience way better then a shitty laptop speakers (I'm a PC nerd) she needs to fk off and get some headphones because I would have done the same as you and told her to stfu.\n\nShe tested ur patience she deserved it", "NTA.

Not the common areas.  She can put her damn headphones in too.  How about she have some of that same empathy for the people she lives with as well?

I hate not being able to sleep, but I bet after exploding you didn\u2019t get any sleep.  I can also definitely recommend a white nose machine or some of those sleeping headphones piping in music, podcasts, or white noise if you are easily awakened and live with other people.

You are right to be angry, IMO.  \n\nJane is for sure a massive, inconsiderate AH.
