This seemed great because it allowed me and my siblings to socialize with people our age outside of school. However, at some point when I was 12 or 13 I would notice that a lot of these parents would come and just abandon their kids. We lived on a big property and we had goats, horses, chickens, ponds, etc. and I would notice that young kids were playing around these dangerous things without any supervision. Because of this, I felt like I had to keep an eye on them. I am not sure how it happened, but soon it became the norm for the same families to dump their kids on me whenever they were with my parents at one of these social functions. I spent a massive chunk of my teen years going to socials where I just became a free nanny to sometimes 5 kids at once for hours on end. I remember feeling like I couldn\u2019t say no because they were adults. I also remember feeling like the biggest loser ever. I remember seeing my older sister chatting with her friends and all sorts if cute boys while I was cast to the side sweaty, stressed out, and making sure kids don\u2019t stick their fingers in electrical outlets or something. I confided in my older sister about how this was stressing me out and how I felt like I wasn\u2019t making friends because of this, but when I asked her to help she would just tell me she \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like it\u201d.\n\nThis brings us to 4th of July. my parents wanted a big party in their yard and my sister has a five year old. I saw her approach my daughter about 30 min into the party, and soon my daughter leaves her groups of friends and sits with her baby cousin. More than an hour later, I find her still with her cousin and my sister nowhere to be found. I ask her what she is doing, and she replies that her aunt asked her to \u201cwatch (niece) for a bit\u201d I wanted to talk with my sister about this and found her standing in the air conditioned living room with a drink in her hand laughing and talking with friends. I pulled her aside and asked her why she would make my daughter baby sit for free and that it was unfair to shirk responsibility onto my kid when she should be enjoying time with her friends. She responded that she \u201cwanted a break because it is hard being a single mother, and she just wanted to have fun today\u201d. I told her that if she couldn\u2019t  handle being a single mom then she \u201cshould have kept her legs shut\u201d (I know, that\u2019s bad). Things escalated and my husband and I left early. \n\nFamily members have been texting me saying that I am an asshole. However, I feel strongly about this and believe that my daughter was being taken advantage of. My husband thinks that I should have let it happen and let our daughter figure that out herself. So reddit, AITA? \n\nUpdate: recently had a phone call with my mom since the incident. I told her that I hated the fact that my sister went behind my back to get my daughter to watch her kid for her for an undisclosed amount of time (\u201ca bit\u201d does not mean \u201cmore than an hour) and I felt like it was exploitative, especially since she went behind my back.

Honestly,  if she didn't wanna be a single mom, she should have \"kept her legs shut\". I have no sympathy for parents who had kids without thinking of every possible outcome. When you have kids, they are your responsibility, no one else's. Too many people have kids without thinking of the possibility of ending up a single parent, (let alone anything else that could happen) your partner could leave you, they could die, they could be in some crazy accident leaving them unable to care for a child.

Things like this do mean something to kids.  Seeing their mom is actually on their side.  When a parent sides with the family against a kid.  That just makes the kid close everyone off.  I know, I did that.  My parents would defend me to strangers.  But if it was within the family.  I knew that everyone's word mattered more than mine.  I matter less than everyone else in the family.  They might not have meant it that way, but it was the message that was sent by their actions.\n\nBut standing up to your family you've made a huge investment in your daughters trust.

It was just a one time thing and it was only one kid, your sister obviously was just chancing it a bit and pushing it, she probably should have asked an adult to watch her child or not been gone as long. I think you could\u2019ve communicated to her a bit more calmly about the situation once you realised what was going on and just asked her not to do it again. It seems maybe you feel used to being taken advantage of and maybe not being listened to in your family so it\u2019s not really about just the babysitting but a bigger issue that needs communicating, it seems you felt worried they\u2019re now taking advantage of your kid as an extension of you. I personally think it\u2019s good for older kids to be given responsibilities like that from time to time and shouldn\u2019t have to be paid for it, it\u2019s a learning experience and matures a kid, but the responsibilities should be shared and no one should take the piss. I used to babysit 3 kids at age 15, one of which had special needs but I loved it and they were perfectly safe in my care because I was mature for my age, from having these kinds of experiences.", "You can't let one child be responsible for another no matter how old.

Let her know she can say no, and stay with her friends in these situations, or she can instead say yes, but with pay, suggest $20/hr.   \n    \nThen let her know, if the person keeps pushing, to come find you and you will 100% of the time back her, and get the other adult to leave her alone.   \n    \nMake sure she knows that there are some expectations of her inside the family, whatever chores you have, but anything else is optional and she should be paid for it, even if it is for her aunt or grandma.", "ESH \n\nThe leg bit. Yeah. That was not ok. Sexist bs.\n\nBut so is family pressuring a kid into being the nanny. Your sister chose to have a kid. She doesn't get to opt out and make another kid take on her slack.", ">>> you used to do it all the time, remember? \n\nYes, and I fucking hated it. You'd know that if anyone bothered to ask. \n\nNTA. but you should have called your mom out during that phone call", "You saw your sister do exactly what had been done to you for years. Good on you for standing up for your daughter. Do it every time", "My sisters are 14 years apart in age. When OS had kids, YS was not willing to babysit for free. Fair enough. By the time YS had kids, the older niblings were teens and guess who got all kinds of upset that they were not willing to watch their little cousins for free? YS had big time anger that she couldn't get someone to watch her kids for free.", "Idk, sounds like she got dealt crap from her sister most of her life, she needed some stern words to get through to her.", "I agree. Even at my age I have a hard time speaking up to my parents. Hopefully I can raise my daughter to be less of a pushover, because lord knows that I have been in enough predicaments because I have a hard time saying no to authority figures.", "That is another thing that frustrated me. There were boys older than my daughter there and yet my daughter was asked.", "Yes that was, regrettably, way over the line. I texted her a long apology for the comment but nothing else. I didn\u2019t include this info in the post because there is a character limit of 3,000, but my sister and I have had a strained relationship for a long time because she has always been kind of entitled and an asshole. If you can think of a girl who peaked in highschool you have my sister. I am not someone who looks down on girls who have sex outside of marriage and whatnot, that was a distasteful comment made in the heat of the moment.", "I kind of dodged it. I have an incredibly difficult time communicating stuff like this to my mom. Hopefully I will get better at it and teach my kid to not take everything kneeling.", "I did end up apologizing for that because yes, that was disgusting and off color. She has not responded to my messages yet.", "I think you are right on with the projecting aspect. I got really upset and looking back on it now I did overreact a bit due to the personal nature of it. However, I still believe I was correct in putting a stop to it because knowing my sister she definitely did it to be exploitative, and was probably testing the waters of how much she could get away with. I have seen her do this with me many times.", "Yep. OP was absolutely in the right up until she made that comment. Had she just been an adult about it and done what you suggested everything would've been fine. Sister may have then just asked her mom or someone else to help for a bit. Instead, OP said something extremely cruel and essentially slut shamed her sister. That one comment could seriously damage her relationship with her sister and also makes her look like a massively insensitive asshole to the rest of the family and anyone else who heard her say it.", "You need to for your kids sake, the most relief I got was when I finally stood up for myself. you'd be surprised on how much they respect you after they've got over it", "That\u2019s fair enough, you know your family best. Maybe apologise for getting angry but try and have a proper conversation about your feelings in general at some point in the future, it\u2019s often good to lead with how you feel rather than accusing the other person. It sounds like there\u2019s some resentments going unspoken. Hopefully she can be more understanding but who knows, you\u2019d have nothing to lose in speaking though and maybe could improve things with her.", "I am a firm believer in NOT YOUR KID NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f!!!\n\nOP NTA. Asking kids to watch kids for free is exploitative. I personally would have said ok Mom since family helps family you can take care of the kids at the next gathering.  Alternatively OP create a family group chat before the next gathering and let everyone know that due to such high demand for babysitting your daughter has launched a babysitting service and charges $15/hr payable up front. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOn a serious note kids should be kids for as long as they can. Adulting is hard. They need to live as carefree as possible and enjoy their childhood before it is gone.", "You are right that that comment was inexcusable, and I have since apologized. To your point about our relationship, I do not have a great relationship with my sister because she is incredibly narcissistic, and I do not intend to have a good relationship with her until she is no longer stuck in highschool. I don\u2019t ever assume she has good intentions and feel as though she was trying to get under my skin knowing by singling my daughter out and having her do something that she knew upset me when we were that age. This is all info I did not include because the character limit made me limit my story.", "Except that sister went behind her back.  If she thought it was fine, she would have let the mom know that she'd deprived her niece of the chance to hang with friends /relatives her own age, and made her sit in the heat, watching another child.", ">charges ~~$15/hr~~ payable up front\n\n$100/hr payable in cash, up front, 2 hour minimum charge.\n\nFixed it for you."]}
