This seemed great because it allowed me and my siblings to socialize with people our age outside of school. However, at some point when I was 12 or 13 I would notice that a lot of these parents would come and just abandon their kids. We lived on a big property and we had goats, horses, chickens, ponds, etc. and I would notice that young kids were playing around these dangerous things without any supervision. Because of this, I felt like I had to keep an eye on them. I am not sure how it happened, but soon it became the norm for the same families to dump their kids on me whenever they were with my parents at one of these social functions. I spent a massive chunk of my teen years going to socials where I just became a free nanny to sometimes 5 kids at once for hours on end. I remember feeling like I couldn\u2019t say no because they were adults. I also remember feeling like the biggest loser ever. I remember seeing my older sister chatting with her friends and all sorts if cute boys while I was cast to the side sweaty, stressed out, and making sure kids don\u2019t stick their fingers in electrical outlets or something. I confided in my older sister about how this was stressing me out and how I felt like I wasn\u2019t making friends because of this, but when I asked her to help she would just tell me she \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like it\u201d.\n\nThis brings us to 4th of July. my parents wanted a big party in their yard and my sister has a five year old. I saw her approach my daughter about 30 min into the party, and soon my daughter leaves her groups of friends and sits with her baby cousin. More than an hour later, I find her still with her cousin and my sister nowhere to be found. I ask her what she is doing, and she replies that her aunt asked her to \u201cwatch (niece) for a bit\u201d I wanted to talk with my sister about this and found her standing in the air conditioned living room with a drink in her hand laughing and talking with friends. I pulled her aside and asked her why she would make my daughter baby sit for free and that it was unfair to shirk responsibility onto my kid when she should be enjoying time with her friends. She responded that she \u201cwanted a break because it is hard being a single mother, and she just wanted to have fun today\u201d. I told her that if she couldn\u2019t  handle being a single mom then she \u201cshould have kept her legs shut\u201d (I know, that\u2019s bad). Things escalated and my husband and I left early. \n\nFamily members have been texting me saying that I am an asshole. However, I feel strongly about this and believe that my daughter was being taken advantage of. My husband thinks that I should have let it happen and let our daughter figure that out herself. So reddit, AITA? \n\nUpdate: recently had a phone call with my mom since the incident. I told her that I hated the fact that my sister went behind my back to get my daughter to watch her kid for her for an undisclosed amount of time (\u201ca bit\u201d does not mean \u201cmore than an hour) and I felt like it was exploitative, especially since she went behind my back.

Honestly,  if she didn't wanna be a single mom, she should have \"kept her legs shut\". I have no sympathy for parents who had kids without thinking of every possible outcome. When you have kids, they are your responsibility, no one else's. Too many people have kids without thinking of the possibility of ending up a single parent, (let alone anything else that could happen) your partner could leave you, they could die, they could be in some crazy accident leaving them unable to care for a child.

Things like this do mean something to kids.  Seeing their mom is actually on their side.  When a parent sides with the family against a kid.  That just makes the kid close everyone off.  I know, I did that.  My parents would defend me to strangers.  But if it was within the family.  I knew that everyone's word mattered more than mine.  I matter less than everyone else in the family.  They might not have meant it that way, but it was the message that was sent by their actions.\n\nBut standing up to your family you've made a huge investment in your daughters trust.

It was just a one time thing and it was only one kid, your sister obviously was just chancing it a bit and pushing it, she probably should have asked an adult to watch her child or not been gone as long. I think you could\u2019ve communicated to her a bit more calmly about the situation once you realised what was going on and just asked her not to do it again. It seems maybe you feel used to being taken advantage of and maybe not being listened to in your family so it\u2019s not really about just the babysitting but a bigger issue that needs communicating, it seems you felt worried they\u2019re now taking advantage of your kid as an extension of you. I personally think it\u2019s good for older kids to be given responsibilities like that from time to time and shouldn\u2019t have to be paid for it, it\u2019s a learning experience and matures a kid, but the responsibilities should be shared and no one should take the piss. I used to babysit 3 kids at age 15, one of which had special needs but I loved it and they were perfectly safe in my care because I was mature for my age, from having these kinds of experiences.", "You can't let one child be responsible for another no matter how old.
