This seemed great because it allowed me and my siblings to socialize with people our age outside of school. However, at some point when I was 12 or 13 I would notice that a lot of these parents would come and just abandon their kids. We lived on a big property and we had goats, horses, chickens, ponds, etc. and I would notice that young kids were playing around these dangerous things without any supervision. Because of this, I felt like I had to keep an eye on them. I am not sure how it happened, but soon it became the norm for the same families to dump their kids on me whenever they were with my parents at one of these social functions. I spent a massive chunk of my teen years going to socials where I just became a free nanny to sometimes 5 kids at once for hours on end. I remember feeling like I couldn\u2019t say no because they were adults. I also remember feeling like the biggest loser ever. I remember seeing my older sister chatting with her friends and all sorts if cute boys while I was cast to the side sweaty, stressed out, and making sure kids don\u2019t stick their fingers in electrical outlets or something. I confided in my older sister about how this was stressing me out and how I felt like I wasn\u2019t making friends because of this, but when I asked her to help she would just tell me she \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like it\u201d.\n\nThis brings us to 4th of July. my parents wanted a big party in their yard and my sister has a five year old. I saw her approach my daughter about 30 min into the party, and soon my daughter leaves her groups of friends and sits with her baby cousin. More than an hour later, I find her still with her cousin and my sister nowhere to be found. I ask her what she is doing, and she replies that her aunt asked her to \u201cwatch (niece) for a bit\u201d I wanted to talk with my sister about this and found her standing in the air conditioned living room with a drink in her hand laughing and talking with friends. I pulled her aside and asked her why she would make my daughter baby sit for free and that it was unfair to shirk responsibility onto my kid when she should be enjoying time with her friends. She responded that she \u201cwanted a break because it is hard being a single mother, and she just wanted to have fun today\u201d. I told her that if she couldn\u2019t  handle being a single mom then she \u201cshould have kept her legs shut\u201d (I know, that\u2019s bad). Things escalated and my husband and I left early. \n\nFamily members have been texting me saying that I am an asshole. However, I feel strongly about this and believe that my daughter was being taken advantage of. My husband thinks that I should have let it happen and let our daughter figure that out herself.

Good for you for standing up for your daughter. Female teenage relatives should not be the automatic go too for free or compulsory baby sitting, but they are forced into that role all to often. You definitely get a \"great mom\" award.", "NTA. Baby sitting takes time, and it should be compensated. Yes it's tough being a single parent, but take responsibility and atleast pay or gift the person.", "NTA.  Your sister abandoned her baby to a teenager.  She bullied the teenager into compliance.  Your husband is just wrong.  Its his kid being put in a corner.  What is wrong with him?  Rather than seeking compensation, you need to make clear that a) your child will not be responsible for any other child absent your express approval, b) such approval may be conditioned on time limitations and compensation, and c) failure to abide by the following will result in any such child being returned to the parent and your child instructed to ignore all (each and every one) of any instruction or demand coming from the family member.  Hubby needs to back you up.  You need to teach your kid to decline, and to make a scene where necessary of \"I'm sorry, you know you have to book babysitting through my mother.\"", "It's ridiculous to expect a 13 year old to do this, 13 year olds are still kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "not an asshole for not wanting your kid to experience what you experienced before. but teach your kid that she can say 'no' to things she doesn't want to do. this is what you should have done when you were younger.", "Not an ah.

You stood up for your child and I see no issue with that. LIKE it's the 4th. She should have been running around playing not watching a kid.  Your sister needs to understand her child is not the responsibility of another child and we all know why she wouldn't ask another adult they would have brought the child back to her or said no. She said she wanted to have fun well so did your child.", "NTA\n\nDo you know what situations you leave children to figure out themselves? Situations among their peers. Not an adult family member making a request of them because they have most likely been taught to listen to that adult. This is a time and age where now they need to be taught when and where to say no. This is a teaching moment, not a throw them to the wolves moment. What is your husband thinking?\n\nI would sit your daughter down and talk with her about what she's willing and not willing to do in situations like this. For instance is she willing to do it for compensation? And what rate? She can set these terms. Is she willing to watch her cousin for 30 minutes to help out? Set a timer and if your sister pulls a disappearing act, what happens?", "NTA. You saw your sister do exactly what had been done to you for years. Good on you for standing up for your daughter. Do it every time. Reinforce to your daughter that she can say no; that she can walk away and that she doesn't have to watch the children.", "NTA but really...you had to go there? \u201cshould have kept her legs shut\u201d\n\nIf this is the same sister who did not respond in your best interest when you were young her current behavior is not surprising. \n\nYour sister is entitled. Your daughter cannot get back time and she likely felt obligated cause it's her aunt; an adult that asked her to watch her kid.  Babysitting instead of making memories with her friends in not OK. You called your sister out taking advantage of her kindness.  Yes, a 10 to 15 minute break while mom goes to the bathroom or grabs some food is fine but she wants what she wants. \n\nThanks for not allowing the kid sitting cycle continue to the next generation.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are a great parent.

At the same time, that seems to be pretty rude to me and doesn't help the situation. \n\nI would apologize for that specific phrase but stand my ground on everything else.", "Unpopular opinion, but YTA.

Honestly,  if she didn't wanna be a single mom, she should have \"kept her legs shut\". I have no sympathy for parents who had kids without thinking of every possible outcome. When you have kids, they are your responsibility, no one else's. Too many people have kids without thinking of the possibility of ending up a single parent, (let alone anything else that could happen) your partner could leave you, they could die, they could be in some crazy accident leaving them unable to care for a child. If she wanted to chill and have fun, she should have HIRED a babysitter. You dont get breaks. Its a 24/7 job.

Matter of factly, without recriminations or anger.\n\nYour language was uncalled for. So ESH (she's much worse than you).", "I think the issue here is that OP felt obligated to care for other children because no one else would. Saying \"no\" works for yourself, but those kids would still be running around unsafe. If the parents are off drinking and partying, I think its fair for another adult to step up and say something to them. Especially when it involves her kid."]}
