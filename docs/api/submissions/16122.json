He is even acting like I don't taking care of anything anymore and it's all on him, even though I do all the cooking and cleaning, I put everything together for the baby. He's just being so mean and I just need to know if I am the problem.\n\n\nEdit: I would like to clarify that before I was pregnant I never had a problem walking my dogs, I appreciate people's concerns about me \"not doing enough training\" but I would like everyone to know, having issues walking them is a result of being pregnant.", "created_utc": 1682944275, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134l740/aita_for_not_walking_the_dog/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
