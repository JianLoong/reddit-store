I said no once again and tried to rush everyone out the door to get to breakfast. I also explained that I\u2019m certain everyone is going to want popcorn, candy, soda, etc. at the movies, which of course everyone agreed.\n\nMy wife said that \u201cthey are only kids, they are really hungry, and allowing them to eat junk before breakfast was OK. She then went on to say that not everyone needs to follow your (my) diet.\u201d In the end, my wife \u201coverruled\u201d my decision and told the kids to grab anything they wanted. They did, and it pissed me off.

If she does it a lot it undermines your authority. \n\nI would ask how healthy they eat in general. I assume not very. \n\nJunk food is addictive, physically so. Your diet as a kid affects you in life. It\u2019s not a joke. Some additives in processed foods are bad for your long term health.

They need to have their diets moderated because they don't have the self-control or insight to do it themselves. There is absolutely no reason a child of that age is \"entitled\" to processed junk food at breakfast time, especially when you already have plans to go out for breakfast and then the kids probably wont be hungry for actual breakfast. A 5/7 year old is too immature to understand that if you are about to eat a meal you shouldn't eat a bunch of junk food right before the meal. They just think about the cookies and how much they want to eat them \\*right now\\* and dont see beyond that. A parent's job is to moderate and teach them responsible eating. You did the right thing. Wife was in the wrong for indulging in the kids bad habits and being a pushover, also undermining your authority in front of the kids.

I\u2019d be surprised if they wanted to eat breakfast after that. Followed up by movie theater junk food later.

Making them wait 20-30 minutes to have food sitting in front of them is perfectly acceptable. They didn\u2019t need a snack for a 10 minute drive. You\u2019re not pushing your food agenda on your children unless you want them to understand you can\u2019t eat unhealthy food all day, everyday. And your wife should\u2019ve had your back on the decision.", "NTA.  You offered your kids healthy food.  They turned it down.  Clearly they weren't that all hungry.

Kids have empty legs.", "NTA. Children might be hungry but hungry children will eat veggies or fruit (fruit is as sweet as candy). Whenever someone in this house says they are hungry (and I know it is a lie, they just want candy or cookies) I always tell them I am happy to make them veggies (sometimes fruit). If they say no I know they are not hungry but -as we call it in our home - snacky (translated from another language).", "I think your wife is a lousy mother.

There was no need for them to spoil their appetite for breakfast by allowing them to fill up on junk. They were to full to eat breakfast so money was wasted. And your wife is wrong - just because they are kids doesn't mean that they should what they want when they want. Junk food might not kill them but it doesn't make them healthy either. At that age, kids would consume ice cream and candy all day if you let them.\n\nJunk food isn't bad when it's an occasional treat-all things in moderation. What is concerning is your wife undermining your authority as a parent. You are supposed to present a united front in the face of these kinds of issues.

Parties I had little to no control over and there were non-healthy treats on holidays but at home I kept meal food and treat food, but 99% healthy.  Treats could be bananas or carrots with dip, also fruit yogurt or decent granola bars.  The only unhealthy choice was potato chips. My now teenager doesn't eat like I do ( vegan and whole foods enthusiast) but has a fairly healthy diet.  I get misty happy when he opts for side salads at restaurants (he is allowed to choose for himself.)\nNTA.  OP is exactly right.  If they are \"starving\" they can grab an apple.", "Sounds like his wife would just go and buy it anyway.", "I like your grandma. I said something similar and everyone chose the option of not eating until my wife made it clear snacks were fine.\n\nMy wife would be absolutely pissed if the shoes were reversed but then again, I would never do that.

When we did go out to eat, they hardly ate anything because they were already full.", "No, I would not say that it is a habit. I just sympathized with them for being hungry because it was already 10AM.

Whenever that happens, I voice my frustration about that and explain that I want my kids to eat healthy. She absolutely hates that and basically tells me I should cook then. I usually remind her that\u2019s what I do damn near always. She then gives me some speech about I can cook what I want and she can cook what she wants.\n\nWe really don\u2019t fight a lot but fighting about food has definitely happened more than once.", "Generally speaking, my children actually do eat pretty healthy foods. I cook them breakfast and dinner every single day unless we are going out to eat. They pay for lunch at school.\n\nAlthough, my youngest doesn\u2019t really eat a lot of vegetables (big surprise), but very rarely has fast food, frozen food, etc. So to some extent, I\u2019m sure giving them some junk before breakfast isn\u2019t the end of the world but I still don\u2019t like it. This is part of why I even asked if I\u2019m the asshole. \n\nFor more context about my beliefs, my parents never controlled what food I ate. They were also very poor and cheap, unhealthy meals were common for my family. I had weight problems when I was a teenager and refuse to allow that to happen to my children. That\u2019s why I regulate their food choices, encourage active hobbies, etc. I\u2019m in a much better financial situation than my parents were, so I don\u2019t resent them, but I wish they did better in making sure I wasn\u2019t eating like a pig.", "Thissssss NTA on the junk food but absolutely TA for a basic failure to parent.

The kids played for a little bit in the morning while my wife and I got ready. I was ready to go before my wife and was sitting downstairs while the kids were playing waiting for her. No one said a single word about being hungry. As soon as my spouse came downstairs, we put our shoes and jackets on to start walking outside. My youngest started crying, legitimately crying, that she was starving. The rest of what happened is in the post, but happy to answer any questions that may be helpful. Oh, and all I meant by rush everyone out the door was basically say something like \u201cI know everyone\u2019s hungry so let\u2019s go get in the car. If you want to grab a fruit, grab a fruit, but if not, then let\u2019s go\u201d.", "Exactly! If junk was the ONLY issue then they would not be getting anything at the theater and would have a nutrient dense meal prior to any outing. I really want to know what they were gonna eat for breakfast because restaurants more often than not have a lot of junk filled with sugar and salt which isn\u2019t a healthy option.", "My wife is inconsistent. Some days she would completely agree about how we shouldn\u2019t disagree in front of the kids (especially if I\u2019m the one who disagrees with something she did).

Some days we just don't have it in us to say no and have to listen to the resulting whining", "Ok, so you already know what the real problem was\u2014you and your wife should have fed them breakfast at their normal breakfast time, even if you were going out to breakfast later. If you were ok with them having junk food at some point, have them split some chocolate chip pancakes while you eat if they\u2019re not really hungry.

Like maybe she was distracted while playing and it wasn't until she felt that rumble in her stomach that she realized she really was hungry and grabbing a bag of muffin bites would be faster and easier than preparing fruit especially if you feel rushed. Like my dad sliced, cut, prepared, etc EVERY piece of fruit for me until I could eat a full portion alone (like age nine or ten).  I think 5 is old enough not to bite into the core but I can't say for sure. Kids have energy which I'm sure you know so a handful of whatever probably wouldn't have spoiled her breakfast.  Yeah a healthier option is just better but sometimes you need to cave and communicate. Like \"Okay you have this snack but just this once. Next time you ask for a snack you need to choose something else.\"  This feels like a day of bad communication.", "Still 30 mins till eating.\n\nYour wife is sick of you controlling the food. She over ruled you because she is done.\n\nYou say she should have backed you...but maybe she is sick of that. Maybe you need to take a chill pill and back her.", "Definitely. Love that example!\nMy kid has always seen me have fruit and other healthy stuff for dessert, which also helps.", "100% my favorite activity with my fav person was sitting outside in nice weather and my grandpa peeling and feeding me fruits. The most \"junk\" food I had was him telling grandma he'll go buy some milk and take me to drink mango juice and my fav candy...which was actually digestive aids(don't ask lol).\n\n\nI never liked chocolate or ice cream, mostly because no one in my house ate them.", "You're doing a whole lot of projecting here.", "NTA and your wife is enabling unhealthy lifestyles and that's not ok", "It was 10am & they had nothing? If they truly didn\u2019t want the other fruit options, what were you willing to let them eat at home? I\u2019m pretty firm that I provide the food in the house & my kids choose how much to eat & for snacks/hunger cues when to eat", "YTA to wait to GO out for breakfast at 10am. By the time you arrive at restaurant and order it will be 10.30-11.00\n What's wrong with you? Why you didn't make kids something to eat before? Little kids can't wait to eat this long just because you have plans... I'm surprised your wife went along with it  amd didn't make kids some quick toast when they woke up", "NTA. Your wife owes you an apology for \"overruling\" you in front of the kids. If you're going to be co-parenting you need to present a united front.", "NTA your wife should have supported you. Your kids are your responsibility and so is their health. If children would choose their own diet it would be coke and ice cream", "YTA for making a 5 and 7 yo wait for breakfast at 1030+.  10 min drive to the restaurant and at least 10-15 minutes before you're seated and get your order in.  I'm assuming it's not fast food for breakfast, since you seem to impose your dietary preferences on your family.  Kids that young not eating until close to 11 AM?  The fuck is wrong with you?\n\nYou know damn well kids that age will graze at breakfast knowing they're getting popcorn and candy at the theater for,  checks notes, a lunch time movie.\n\nOverall fail at planning.\n\nEdit, forgot a word.", "Can't believe I had to scroll this far down to see this. Kids that age not having breakfast until close to 11 am?", "What a ridiculous take. They were literally *on their way to a restaurant.*", "You have a serious wife problem.  She is going to turn those kids into spoiled brats.", "Info:  what social activity(ies) were you keeping a 7 and 5 yo out until 11pm?\n\nYou can't really think that kids not eating for nearly 12 hours is a good thing, right? A single piece of fruit in 12 hours isn't much at all...."]}
