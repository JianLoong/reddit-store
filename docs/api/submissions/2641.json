So again, why is OP required to empathize?    \nI wouldn't be empathizing and I live in a much lower socio-economic household.", "It definitely happens. My boyfriends aunt is only 5 years older than him.", "love the clown face--how does one do these cute emojis?(or red marinara flags?)", "STOP BABYSITTING COMPLETELY! This woman is getting a free sitting n a free house n just leaves a mess. Im telling u stop COMPLETELY BABYSITTING! Every single time say ur only job is to be a mom at least do that since u don't do anything else", "Auntie got a full time job tormenting her nephew and is living in a house rent free, NTA", "have you met an entitled person work a part time job when they don't have to and take care of their cousin? no? then shut your online mouth", "no the OP isn't", "no she does NOT! wow a lot of auntie sympathisers today", "uhh not mother it's trash T-R-A-S-H she did 0 part in taking care for her poor kid", "she can actually", "I'd like to see you try to take care of a leech's child and pick up after her without going insane", "She works part time, does some of the chores, watches the baby, and was cleaning up the aunts mess.  i could use more privileged teens like that in my life.", "Idk why ppl are downvoting you, something about this story rubs me the wrong way too", "That doesn't mean she's not entitled lol. Yall are weird and so rude", "Why are u riding their dick so hard oml get a life", "I don't get this American mentality of kids moving out at 18. Some people actually love their family and enjoy living with them.", "Hey check it out, it\u2019s the guy who doesn\u2019t know what a serial killer is", "I'd like to see a dragon", " She. Makes. Her. Own. Money. \n\nand she isn't even 18 yet", "Stalk much?", "Uh, that\u2019s not even the story. Free-loading aunt left a mess. Niece cleaned it up, muttering about it. Aunt overheard and went ballistic and defensive. Niece then losses temper. \n\nMy estimate is \u201cmostly NTA\u201d Aunt being a bad guest /moocher isn\u2019t a fun thing to deal w. Especially when said aunt is getting free child care on top.", "A lot of details were left out. Is your aunt in school? Who's paying for her schooling/child? Paying rent or bills? Does she receive child support? Aren't you in school? How do you babysit every day while going to school and working a part-time job? I imagine there might be some things you may not be privy to.\n\nYour passive agressive comment was uncalled for but so was hers and your response. Nobody asked you to clean up the living room so don't do it if it bothers you so much? At the end of the day she lives there too and it's your parent's house.", "NTA aunty doesn't even realize how easy she has it.", "If OP is privileged what is her aunt? \n\nLiving in one of her siblings house, not paying for anything, having her niece baby sit while she does exactly what?, OP cleans up after her. \nSo she's what.... privileged, spoiled, entitled? \n\nOP has a part time job, most likely study or will take up a study, cleans after aunt, baby sits, is not taking advantage of comming from a privileged background by sitting on her ass and spending mom and dad's money. \n\nYeah I would be pissy too if I  come home from work and end up cleaning up after someone who has been at home all day and be used as free baby sitter while parents is the woman's wallet. \n\nAunt should keep her mouth shut about how hard she has it. She has it easy. There are single parents juggling two jobs, bills, baby.\nShe is privileged. And taking full advantage of it."]}
