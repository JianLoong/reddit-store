Have you confirmed with your friend that kids will be there?", "YTA for the reason you gave.

Blowing a friend off because you don\u2019t like children is AH move", "You\u2019re not forced to attend a shower, which normally doesn\u2019t have kids there, but you\u2019re a bad friend which makes you the asshole. \n\nHere\u2019s why, your friend is asking you to celebrate a milestone in HER life. Would you refuse to celebrate someone getting their PhD just because you weren\u2019t interested in what they studied? What about a job promotion because you don\u2019t agree with all of the companies policies? What about buying a house because it\u2019s not in a neighborhood you\u2019d choose to live in. \n\nSo I\u2019m going YTA. Not because you don\u2019t like kids, not because you don\u2019t want to attend, but because of how you handled this and being a bad friend.", "YTA and that's mainly for being a crappy friend. I get it. Kids are not everyone's cup of tea and you have every right to not go, but be prepared to lose this friendship. I would cut contact with a \"friend\" like you. Not because you don't like kids. But, because you can't be supportive for a couple hours.", "Most baby showers I have attended have very few children, if any, so I am wondering if you know for a fact that lots of children will be there?\n\nI think if it\u2019s a good friend, you suck up discomfort or preferences sometimes and do nice things for them. That includes being at a baby shower and getting a gift, attending weddings, driving them to the airport, and listening while they talk about themselves during a hard time. We all pretend to be enjoying ourselves or at least not showing our misery at some time or another. \n\nI vote YTA with some compassion because I dislike many parties but I also go to support my friends.", "[deleted]", "YTA for the way you rejected the invite.

I maybe really the AH here. I will talk to my friend and I will attend her Babyshower (If she still wants me too).", "YTA - because you didn't do your research first. Saying you're \"not interested in attending\" makes it seem like you aren't coming because you don't support her decision to have a child. I've never been to a baby shower that had a child present, so you should have asked her questions and discussed your concerns.", "YTA\n\nNot because you don\u2019t want to go, but because you can\u2019t set aside your dislike of kids for a few hours to celebrate with your friend. I don\u2019t like cats, but I don\u2019t ditch friends because they have cats. By the way, are you no longer going to be friends with her once she gives birth?", "Fine not to attend, but this would have been a situation in which a little white lie would have been better. Next time just say you're busy or something. YTA", "I\u2019d say it depends on how close you are. Is she a part of your inner circle of friends or more of a peripheral friend? If you\u2019re close, I\u2019d say suck it up and go to the baby shower. Children aren\u2019t typically at baby showers. But even if there are kids, one afternoon won\u2019t kill you. If you\u2019re more distant of friends, passing on this is more justified. \n\nAlso, what about once the baby is here? Will you not see your friend if her kid is with her? If that\u2019s the case, this friendship probably won\u2019t last.", "INFO: \nAre you skipping because there will be kids in attendance? Or are you skipping because you are against kids in general?", "YTA for how you declined the invitation. \n\nYou could have just said that you had a conflict. \n\nOr you could suck it up and go support your friend for 2 hours on a weekend afternoon. \n\nAlso, not sure why there would be kids at a baby shower. There have never been kids at any baby shower I\u2019ve attended\u2014did she tell you there would be? \n\nGenerally, I\u2019m all for spending limited free time doing things you enjoy, not being miserable.

It is one afternoon get over yourself.", "YTA\n\n\nHow do you know there are going to be screaming babies.  Most baby showers I have gone to have been fun and I drank at (except my own)\n\n\nI dont like having to do a lot of things like sitting at football and hockey games, but I do it for my brother and nephew.  I may not want to stand at the sidelines of a marathon, but im supporting my friend who is running.  Even as a parent I don't like going to kids play places for birthday parties, but I go to support the bday kid or friend whose kid it is.\n\n\n\nMy point is, sometimes you gotta suck it up for an hour or 2 for a friend or family member.  I mean I'm sure there are plenty of family and friends who have supported you in some way, went out with you when they wanted to stay home, but did it any way cause they care.", "You do realise your friend will be attached to a baby for a while most of the time you see her for the foreseeable future, hearing this reason from you probably made her feel like you were going to put this above seeing her anymore because she's going to have a baby?", "YTA. It's about her, not you. Do you also avoid restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, airplanes, etc.? Because screaming kids go there too. They are just people. You don't have to have your own but they are part of the human population.", "YTA. \n\nI hate kids too, but I would show up for the baby shower giving a gift. Sorry, but you need to toughen up a little bit when it comes to things that you don't like and learn how to deal.

How would you feel if you were having an event to celebrate something special in your life, and a friend told you they were \u201cnot interested\u201d in sharing in your joy?  This is about celebrating your friend and the joy in her life.  If you really can\u2019t put on a happy face to celebrate your friend\u2019s joy for a couple of hours, then just say you have a conflict and cannot make it, but are happy for her and will send a gift.  Don\u2019t tell her you\u2019re \u201cnot interested,\u201d which honestly is a terrible thing to say. \n\nActually, maybe you did your friend a favor . . .", "Don't worry, children probably feel the same about you.

It's okay to not attend a party you don't want to attend. But there was no need to say that to her. You could just as easily have said that you're not free that day or that you're not attending parties because there's still a pandemic killing people. Or you could even have said you're coming, then phoned to say you're not feeling well and didn't want to risk all those babies who are young and vulnerable and that you'd give her the baby shower present some other time.", "NAH but you\u2019re not going to have a friend much longer.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to go, and you are not that because you said upfront you aren't coming.", "Ish.\n\nIt's ok don't like an event, but the way you skipped the baby shower was rude.", "Ok, I will get downvoted here, but NTA, why?

Life is full of inconveniences and being around things that mildly annoy you for people you love. do I like commuting an hour to see my friends in queens? No. But I do it because I love them and it's important for me to see them. You're basically telling your friend she's not important enough for you to put up with some inconveniences.", "NTA. Send a nice gift in your stead and call it a day.", "NTA. Not everyone likes being around kids or baby related parties, and people need to realize that it can make some people uncomfortable to be around that. If anything, she is selfish for making you feel guilty and trying to get you to go regardless of how you feel about it.", "NTA- it's just a stupid ass party. I can't imagine getting pissed at someone for not attending. People have lives. \n\nYTA- the part where you flat out say you're not interested. Hilarious, but I would come up with a better excuse and then ask them for their gift registry.", "Unpopular as of now, but NTA. No one should be forced to interact with something that they outright dislike unless necessary, and baby showers aren't. The reason why people are calling you and AH are because babies and children in general are not socially acceptable to dislike. Perhaps saying it outright was a bit in your face, but you weren't wrong to do it either because at the end of the day, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH DISLIKING CHILDREN. Let's frame it in another way; my friend adopted a dog and is throwing a dog welcoming party and I told her that I dislike dogs and was thus, not going, AITA? I doubt that you'd find a single Y T A.\n\nAs for your relationship with your friend, well, be prepared to lose it. People that get offended over you not liking a child is also the type of person that will expect you to constantly interact it.

You have free will, but that doesnt equate to freedom from any consequences.", "I completely agree here. I have known people who know for a fact I dislike kids who have kids and 100% expect me to be involved since we were friends. It starts out with hey you can suffer through one afternoon for a baby shower, and leads to expectations that you'll babysit and be super involved in that kids life. I lost track of the times people have tried pawning their kids off on me to take fishing, even though I specifically told them that's my hobby I do for myself and don't like kids so won't be happening. I wish people would just accept that some people have zero interest in kids and have that be more socially acceptable.", "Conversely, I have never been to a baby shower with kids present.", "I'm sure a few toddlers being present for a couple of hours wasn't going to cause OP a mental breakdown. Not being able to put aside your dislike for kids for 1 afternoon to show a friend you care and take part in their happiness shows that they don't really value their friendship.

I have a friend who had a kid and before he was born, my friend made it very clear that he was okay with me not wanting to participate in any of the baby party shenanigans or anything really after that when the kid was born.

Also baby showers are usually adults only and even if there is a kid or two there, then don\u2019t engage with them. \n\nI think I read someone else asking in their response too but I\u2019ll ask it again - what do you plan to do once this friend does in fact have the baby? Do you think you could still be friends with her once she\u2019s officially a mom? I ask this because you may want to prepare yourself for distance in the friendship if you cant tolerate a baby\u2019s presence once it\u2019s born\u2026just something to think about. \nAlso remember that if you end up choosing not to attend, one day when you have something going on that you want her to show up at to support you, she may very well not make that effort based on this. \nJust consider and then be prepared is all I\u2019m saying.", "It's rude to turn down social invitations in general, but YTA after your friend made it clear that it's important to her that you be there to support her and you still said no.
