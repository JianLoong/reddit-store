We both applied  to a prestigious private college under its early action program. Decisions were released in December. I was accepted but Anne wasn't. I didn't accept the offer until this week because tuition is about 50k per year and I didn't know if I could afford it. However, my grandparents offered to pay half my tuition and I got financial aid and scholarships, so I won't need to take out massive loans to pay.  \n\nI told Anne about it and she accused me of flaunting my intelligence and wealth. I wasn't even bragging. We were talking about college since her second choice (a high-ranked public school) is releasing their decisions next month and I mentioned that I'd accepted the offer. I didn't offer any other information. She asked me how I was going to pay for it, so I told her. I didn't go out of my way to make fun of her, it just came up in a conversation. She then went on to say that she would have been accepted if I wasn't such a try-hard because we're the only people from our school who applied early action. I kind of snapped after that because I've been dealing with this since December.  She's been making up all sorts of bullshit reasons to explain why she didn't get in. She couldn't do extracurriculars because we were at home for a few months of 9th grade and all of 10th grade (I faced the same disruptions), our school is new and doesn't offer enough opportunities (we go to the same school), and so on.\n\n I told her that its her own fault she didn't get in. I've always had straight A's while she has A's and B's. I'm ranked a lot higher than her (1/532 vs 76/532). I've taken eight AP classes and am currently enrolled in five more. She's taken 3 and is enrolled in two this year. I've also done a lot more extracurriculars than her. She signed up to all the same things as me freshman year, but hasn't participated in anything. I've done hundreds of hours of community service, play tennis and badminton, and am president of two clubs and an officer in three others. I've worked my ass off over the last couple years and I'm tired of her belittling my accomplishments. \n\nI've always tried to encourage her to do better. I've regularly stayed up long past midnight to help her with her homework and I helped her write her application essays, but she's always making fun of me for being a nerd and a try-hard while simultaneously insisting that she would go to the same college as me. After I said all this to her, she said that she's kind of glad she didn't get in because she's not rich like me and wouldn't have been able to pay. She knows that I'm not richer than her.  We live in the same middle class neighborhood and our parents make about the same amount of money. The only reason I'm getting money from my grandparents is because they sold their house and downsized.  \n\nThen I said something that I really regret. I told her that it's her own fault for being lazy and not working harder to get in.

She can dish it, but she can\u2019t take it. You sound like you\u2019ve honestly worked hard for this, and considering that you two have similar backgrounds and opportunities, it may very well be on her, but that isn\u2019t even the real problem. She does not sound like a good friend at all, and I suggest you reevaluate your friendship with her. If she was ever a good friend to you, have a sincere heart-to-heart talk with her about how all of her comments make you feel.

Your friend chose not to, which is fine.

Your friend is jealous which is 100% understandable, but she's taking it out on you and you just defended yourself.  Bragging and putting her down would be bad, but I'll take you at your word that that is not what happened.  You were just talking about your future plans and answered a question.  Can't be friends while hiding all the details of your life in order to not make someone feel bad.", "Nta.

But everyone has a breaking point. It\u2019s totally normal for her to be disappointed and even feel like the situation is unfair. But that doesn\u2019t mean she gets to use you as a punching bag for those feelings. Feeling like it\u2019s unfair, and deciding the situation was rigged against her and complaining to you about it are two completely different things.

She is disappointed that a major life goal is not going to happen, and she has to watch it unfold for someone else, in all the ways she wishes it would happen for her. Especially at age 17, this is really hard to do, and even more difficult to do with grace. \n\nKeep that in mind while you spend your efforts with her being the best friend you can to her. Give her space if she needs it, but invite her to do things, support any new goals she has. Do NOT bring up your college plans. She just needs time. If she never comes around, and this is always a thi g between you two, try not to take it personally. It's more about her own hurt than it is about you.", "So \u201ctry hard\u201d is now an insult?

It is normal for her to feel hurt and a bit jealous, but objectively, she probably had the same opportunity to take AP classes and get As as you did.

Cut her out and move on, you won't have lost anything of value.", "I\u2019m split between NAH and ESH. College puts a lot of stress on people and friendships because of the inherent zero sum competition involved and the fact that we all need to confront a lot of the realities of what we did or didn\u2019t do and decisions we did or didn\u2019t make from when we were 13 or 14 years old. No one should let these conversations escalate. No one should turn these things into confrontation. Rather everyone should just work their feelings out on their own", "Mild ESH.\n\nShe had no right to insult you the way you did, you had every right to defend yourself.\n\nThat said you went for the jugular to really let her have it.\n\nYou're both young, hopefully you can move on from it.\n\nEDIT: edited to change judgement to ESH.", "ESH. Your friend is clearly bummed that they were rejected and is jealous of your success. That's a normal, healthy feeling - but instead of simply sitting with that jealousy and unease, your friend has taken it out on you. Perhaps she isn't even aware that's she's jealous... or perhaps she's too afraid of seeing herself as a failure that she actually needs to be able to think of explanation in order to cope mentally. Perhaps she just isn't ready to accept it yet, with further results and unknowns yet to come.\n\nI say ESH here though - because you know all this though... right? Like it won't be news to you. But instead of even sitting with the possiblity that your friend is hurting you're dismissing her feelings as \"bullshit excuses\" and making it about yourself equally as much as your friend is making it about herself. You didn't need to attack her the way you did.\n\nSomeone else said you're both young. And they're right. But I think you're both old enough to have the type of friendship where you say \"This is happening for me and it's great\" and she says \"this is happening for you and it makes me feel shitty about myself, as happy as I am for you\" - it IS possible to both hold empathy for eachother. While one of you is grieving and the other celebrating. The one who celebrates, grieves with the other; the one who grieves, celebrates with the other,.", "Soft ESH?\n\nShe's hurting, and lashing out. You are the easiest target. You are being hurt by this, so lashed out in response. You're not wrong, but the way you said it was unnecessarily hurtful.", "ESH.\n\nYou would be NTA if you hadn\u2019t clapped back with SO MANY examples of your superior academic record. You worked your butt off, I think that is wonderful. You should always defend that fact. But\u2026 tact. You failed there", "ESH:   First off, congratulations!  \n\n\nHave you considered the fact her family may not have the money for more extracurriculars? Living in the same neighborhood does not mean her family is in the same financial situation.  Many, many \"middle class families\" are living outside of their means in incredible amounts of debt.\n \n\nSports, clubs, and such *are* expensive. Plenty of children, myself included, weren't allowed to be part of any that made you pay uniform fees, equipment fees/rentals, etc.\n\nYou did get help; a large amount. What your grandparents did to get it does not negate the fact you have a support that she doesn't.\n\nYou're both teens, and it's a hard time to exist-- let alone watch your friend get something you wanted so badly. \n\nJust be kind to each other.", "YTA, You got in because you worked really hard and she didn't work as hard as you. That's on her. You tried to help her but it sounds like she didn't appreciate it. But you said several things to hurt her feelings and that makes it sound like your rubbing it in for her not getting in. You shouldn't have said anything to make her feel worse.
