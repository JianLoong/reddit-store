His wife is currently in her first trimester with their second child. Due to my younger brother's very poor financial decisions back in Australia, they've decided to move into my parents home, with whom I'm currently staying with. (I would like to add that I'm staying with my parents because we're waiting for our bto to finish building. I'm paying both rent and the Dowry to her, Dowry that is meant to be for my renovations. I won't be surprised if she says it's actually a part of the rent.)\n\nNow my mother (64F), although she denies it, has time and again, showed extremely blatant favouritism towards my brother's wife. Like, she does whatever she can to please her, going as far as to sponsoring their wedding for them about 2 years back. She's never done this for any of her children, just for this particular in-law.  \n\nThe problem now is, she's asked me to give up my bed for them and in my really pissed, cranky state, I replied back with, \"If you do that, I'll just move out of the house.\" She replied back with, \"Ah, so at least you have a place to stay.\" I snorted back and said, \"Sure, the streets.\" \n\nShe got upset and told me not to joke like that.

He's the golden child of the family. My mother paid his bills up until he got married. She likes his wife because she's polite, smart and religious. A trait that none of her other in-laws or kids have.\n\nEdit: Mistook poster child for golden child, corrected it.\n\nEdit 2: I'd just like to clarify a few things first. As much as I'd like to go No contact with her, my dad has done nothing wrong so far, at least to my understanding. It wouldn't be fair for him because he absolutely can't go anywhere without my mother unless it's to pray or go to work. And, I would have to go no contact with my mom's side of the family as she'd easily get information from her.\n\nSecond, I'm not financially stable atm because I'm currently jobless due to me quitting my job then (I left waaaay before finding out I was pregnant) and having to refuse any offer after entering my (late) second trimester by then. My husband doesn't earn enough so we're just waiting for when the baby is out and I get a job to ease the burden of financial responsibilities that he's facing.\n\nThird, my younger brother isn't actually aware of this.

Yet you're expected to give up your bed all because of favoritism.", "Edit: He doesn't  earn enough to be able to rent a place that is affordable enough. With my husband's pay, rent would be higher.\n\nWe have more than enough for the monthly baby supplies but not to be able to rent a place. Here, the rent I pay is between $100 - $200 to my mom. The Dowry is about $250 - $500 (we owe 5k. Which is ridiculous since the money will be going back to me. We've paid $1750 so far). So roughly $350 - $700 per month, depending on the leeway my mother would give at times. Sometimes I pay a cheaper price, sometimes a slightly higher one.\n\nFrom what I've learned from my brother, because my husband earns somewhat a lot (his pay is between 1.9k to 3k), he'd have to pay between $900 - $2000 for rent? I don't know how it works but that was the gist of it.\n\nIf I stay with my parents (or any relatives who'd be willing to let us stay with them), we'd still have enough for the baby things. Sleeplessness nights are okay for me I think? I barely have 2 hours of sleep everyday anyway. But I definitely think the constant crying will get to me. If I need any more help, my mother-in-law is more than happy to look after the kid for a bit while we rest our eyes.\n\nAfter the child is born, give or take maybe a month or two, I'll be heading straight back to job hunting as per usual. If I can secure a job with an okay or better pay, renting a place should be fine. As well as there being more than enough for us financially.", "Probably expected me to get a new bed.\n\nDidn't cross her mind that her own son can probably get his preferred choice of bed. Hopefully he stays within the budget his wife probably sets for him.", "Just get a lock for your door, you pay rent therefore she can\u2019t just evict you from that room.", " Your mom sounds like a jerk.", "The door automatically comes with a lock. We just took the keys to the lock and kept it :)) my mom has to either text me on phone or give me a call when she needs help with something. But otherwise, my husband holds onto the keys so she won't callously open the door without our permission.", "Ahh a win! Don\u2019t give up your room for them ITS YOUR ROOM AND YOU ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT. \n\nTheir shitty decisions have lead them here and that is nothing to do with you! they can deal with not having your bedroom.\n\nYour pregnant too for godsake where did your mother intend to have you sleep?", "If you purchased this bed, you should sleep on it. She can buy them a new bed if she wants. Also if she moves you to a smaller room or charges you an unfair amount of rent, I would reduce what you pay to her each month.", "Hey OP, I\u2019m think I\u2019m from the same country as you. Although I get that it\u2019s hard, at times it\u2019s still best to break off toxic relationships. Even if you can\u2019t bear to do it, think about whether you would want your future child/children experience all these. \n\nI may not have the exact experiences you went through, but I did experience how family and relatives are like. At times no matter what we do, we can never reason with their warped logic and we are always considered as wrong. \n\nI still urge you to do what\u2019s best for you and your future child/children before it becomes inter-generational trauma. Would staying at a \u201chome\u201d like this provide you a good support or does it cause more harm? \n\nI think you\u2019re capable of knowing where this is going the longer you enable toxic relations to do this. The problems would just get bigger, more and more complex while none of them are gonna do anything to solve or help you out and just add on more problems to you. \n\nIf you are never considered good enough for them, the harsh truth is you\u2019ll never be good enough for them. I hope you can get out of this predicament to prevent bigger problems for you and your future child/children. \n\nAll the best!", "Oh. Actually, there's another bedroom for them. But there's no bed. The bed I have is a queen sized one (Asian king according to my brother) so my mom probably thought it'd be enough for them.\n\nIf I gave them this bed, I'd have to buy a new one. That pissed my husband off so badly he nearly went out to confront my mom. We do have a futon but there's only enough space for one person.", ">She can buy them a new bed if she wants.\n\nThe older siblings are pretty much betting on this lol. She knows I'm not willing to give up the bed. Technically, the bed belongs to the older brothers, but the mattress was fully paid by me. Therefore, in their eyes, I am the 'legal' owner.\n\nI'm debating to just pay her a flat fee of a hundred per month for 3 months straight just to be extra petty. And in case she tries to argue, I'm bringing this in as a reminder.", "We're holding on for another year or so since the bto will be completed during that time frame. Then both my husband and I would be free. Free from my controlling mother and free from facing any drama. She'll get a visit from us once a month or when there's a family gathering. My dad we plan to invite him out on lunch when he's at work so he can see his grandson as often as possible.\n\nMy husband is fine with my dad, just not my mom. It's the same with my two older sister-in-laws.", "The sil can take the futon and your brother can sleep on the floor like a gentleman whilst he saves enough money to buy himself and his wife a bed :)", "Oic\nThat\u2019s a good first step in setting boundaries. \nIt may sound hard to maintain relations with some family members when there\u2019s a fear that going low contact or no contact may destroy all your relations including with those you don\u2019t intend to break off. \n\nBut I think your plan sounds good and hopefully you can find a way to maintain relations with those you wish to maintain with while being firm on your boundaries with those that don\u2019t deserve you. I hope your plan goes smoothly and you can forge a better future for you and your closed ones.", "I hope so too. Thank you for your views and advice."]}
