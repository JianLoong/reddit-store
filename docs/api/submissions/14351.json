I nearly flipped her off and told her that I'll sleep in my in-laws living room if I gave to then. Nearly wanted to tell her that she won't be seeing her own grandson if that does happen.

My husband about nearly ripped his hair out learning that he has to stay and tolerate my mother's behaviour for that remaining time.\n\nAnd yeah, her asking for the bed, letting my brother have his way really, really made me realise just how fucked the situation is. It's just made worse now because I realise she cares more about someone who isn't biologically her daughter than her own blood child who is heavily pregnant. Ironically enough, she's been constantly bugging me to tell her if there's anything bothering me.

He avoids my mother like the plague since. Since he's very close to exploding in front of her and he just wants to avoid all the drama.

Still married me anyway.", "I really want to avoid a complete NC if possible, actually. By cutting her off, I risk cutting off her siblings, who helped raise us siblings. She'll badger them for info, and she won't take no for an answer. I also risk cutting off my siblings, who are filial only because in our culture, that is to be expected.\n\nTrust me, I have talked back as politely as I possibly can, and that is without raising my voice. She just can't be reasoned. Having my dad  step in between when he's finally ready to mentally face her is when she'll shut up and sulk for an entire year.", "So about the reason why I \"Can't tell my mom she's the problem\"; she's not someone you can try to reason with. My dad has to throw the \"I am your husband, therefore I have the final say\" card to her face when my two older brothers intervene and have to reason with him instead as to why her actions are just so wrong. I mean, he knows its wrong. He just needs his older sons to have him tell her off.\n\nReason? He's just tired of dealing with her for the past 34 years.", "Oh man. My mom did those for my 2nd older brother and obviously the younger brother. Her two daughters, me and the youngest of us are expected to pay rent. \n\nI wish I can cut them off, but doing so is just so frowned upon in this culture. Plus, I adore my mother's side of the family. I cut her off, I risk cutting them off which I don't want to.\n\nEdit: I hope your mom's much happier now though.", "You have an amazing husband.  I don\u2019t know too many guys who would put up with that."]}
