If you spot any mistake, do let me know. I like learning new things. Also, am from a part of Asia.\n\nI (28F) am currently in my third trimester and my younger brother, his wife (both 25M/F respectively) and their child just got back from Australia. His wife is currently in her first trimester with their second child. Due to my younger brother's very poor financial decisions back in Australia, they've decided to move into my parents home, with whom I'm currently staying with. (I would like to add that I'm staying with my parents because we're waiting for our bto to finish building. I'm paying both rent and the Dowry to her, Dowry that is meant to be for my renovations. I won't be surprised if she says it's actually a part of the rent.)\n\nNow my mother (64F), although she denies it, has time and again, showed extremely blatant favouritism towards my brother's wife. Like, she does whatever she can to please her, going as far as to sponsoring their wedding for them about 2 years back. She's never done this for any of her children, just for this particular in-law.  \n\nThe problem now is, she's asked me to give up my bed for them and in my really pissed, cranky state, I replied back with, \"If you do that, I'll just move out of the house.\" She replied back with, \"Ah, so at least you have a place to stay.\" I snorted back and said, \"Sure, the streets.\" \n\nShe got upset and told me not to joke like that. I nearly flipped her off and told her that I'll sleep in my in-laws living room if I gave to then. Nearly wanted to tell her that she won't be seeing her own grandson if that does happen. She got so upset, she actually texted my eldest brother about it, saying it was just a 'joke' but even my brother didn't find it funny.\n\nSo AITA for replying back to her in a snarky manner?\n\nFor the record, my brother isn't paying rent. He's the golden child of the family. My mother paid his bills up until he got married. She likes his wife because she's polite, smart and religious. A trait that none of her other in-laws or kids have.\n\nEdit: Mistook poster child for golden child, corrected it.\n\nEdit 2: I'd just like to clarify a few things first. As much as I'd like to go No contact with her, my dad has done nothing wrong so far, at least to my understanding. It wouldn't be fair for him because he absolutely can't go anywhere without my mother unless it's to pray or go to work. And, I would have to go no contact with my mom's side of the family as she'd easily get information from her.\n\nSecond, I'm not financially stable atm because I'm currently jobless due to me quitting my job then and having to refuse any offer after entering my second trimester by then. My husband doesn't earn enough so we're just waiting for when the baby is out and I get a job to ease the burden of financial responsibilities that he's facing.\n\nThird, my younger brother isn't actually aware of this. We're not informing him yet so as to not stress out his wife.", "created_utc": 1681033926, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gewie/aita_for_telling_my_mom_id_gladly_move_out_and_be/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
