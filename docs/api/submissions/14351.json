His wife is currently in her first trimester with their second child. Due to my younger brother's very poor financial decisions back in Australia, they've decided to move into my parents home, with whom I'm currently staying with. (I would like to add that I'm staying with my parents because we're waiting for our bto to finish building. I'm paying both rent and the Dowry to her, Dowry that is meant to be for my renovations. I won't be surprised if she says it's actually a part of the rent.)\n\nNow my mother (64F), although she denies it, has time and again, showed extremely blatant favouritism towards my brother's wife. Like, she does whatever she can to please her, going as far as to sponsoring their wedding for them about 2 years back. She's never done this for any of her children, just for this particular in-law.  \n\nThe problem now is, she's asked me to give up my bed for them and in my really pissed, cranky state, I replied back with, \"If you do that, I'll just move out of the house.\" She replied back with, \"Ah, so at least you have a place to stay.\" I snorted back and said, \"Sure, the streets.\" \n\nShe got upset and told me not to joke like that.

He's the golden child of the family. My mother paid his bills up until he got married. She likes his wife because she's polite, smart and religious. A trait that none of her other in-laws or kids have.\n\nEdit: Mistook poster child for golden child, corrected it.\n\nEdit 2: I'd just like to clarify a few things first. As much as I'd like to go No contact with her, my dad has done nothing wrong so far, at least to my understanding. It wouldn't be fair for him because he absolutely can't go anywhere without my mother unless it's to pray or go to work. And, I would have to go no contact with my mom's side of the family as she'd easily get information from her.\n\nSecond, I'm not financially stable atm because I'm currently jobless due to me quitting my job then (I left waaaay before finding out I was pregnant) and having to refuse any offer after entering my (late) second trimester by then. My husband doesn't earn enough so we're just waiting for when the baby is out and I get a job to ease the burden of financial responsibilities that he's facing.\n\nThird, my younger brother isn't actually aware of this.

Yet you're expected to give up your bed all because of favoritism.", "Edit: He doesn't  earn enough to be able to rent a place that is affordable enough. With my husband's pay, rent would be higher.\n\nWe have more than enough for the monthly baby supplies but not to be able to rent a place. Here, the rent I pay is between $100 - $200 to my mom. The Dowry is about $250 - $500 (we owe 5k. Which is ridiculous since the money will be going back to me. We've paid $1750 so far). So roughly $350 - $700 per month, depending on the leeway my mother would give at times. Sometimes I pay a cheaper price, sometimes a slightly higher one.\n\nFrom what I've learned from my brother, because my husband earns somewhat a lot (his pay is between 1.9k to 3k), he'd have to pay between $900 - $2000 for rent? I don't know how it works but that was the gist of it.\n\nIf I stay with my parents (or any relatives who'd be willing to let us stay with them), we'd still have enough for the baby things. Sleeplessness nights are okay for me I think? I barely have 2 hours of sleep everyday anyway. But I definitely think the constant crying will get to me. If I need any more help, my mother-in-law is more than happy to look after the kid for a bit while we rest our eyes.\n\nAfter the child is born, give or take maybe a month or two, I'll be heading straight back to job hunting as per usual.

Would staying at a \u201chome\u201d like this provide you a good support or does it cause more harm? \n\nI think you\u2019re capable of knowing where this is going the longer you enable toxic relations to do this.

I quit, because the environment was so toxic, my mental health relapsed. I was getting even more breakdowns at work, my anxiety sky rocketed, despite reporting workplace bullying, HR and the bosses did nothing. I also went to look for another job, applying every single day. Some I went for interviews but didn't get it, some just outright rejection. That's fine.\n\n3 months later, I find out I'm 2 months in. I still continued applying. Still got rejected. By the time companies started offering me roles, I was already 5 months, entering 6 months.

They retract their offers and my older brothers convinced me to stop looking and to get some rest.\n\n>Your husband doesn\u2019t seem to be doing what he can to support you and your family.\n\nHe's working OT almost every single day. Usually taking on night shifts. He's doing what he can. Paying the rent, the Dowry, his own family's debt (which isn't stated because I didn't feel like it was needed. It was also something that he found out months after he got married. Apparently they missed out on one of his dad's debt), the cat's food and cleaning supplies. Sometimes food when my mom or my lil sister and I don't feel like cooking. His not obliged to help out my family when my family is actually doing fine on their own. It's just my dad, mom and sister. Sister is working part time and studying, dad is working. Financially, they are fine. Mom just asks money for rent and the Dowry money to \"hold it safely until our house is done building\".\n\n>Everyone seems to be just relying on this mom/dad to take care of them all?\n\nBoth older brothers has moved out of the house and has their own. I'm currently staying with my parents while waiting for my house to be done building as it is cheaper. My dad doesn't care about the Dowry, he just wants to make sure we give money to my mom to help with some of the bills, which we do pay. \nMy younger brother is the one that my mom sort of fawns over along with his wife. He had actually asked my mom to send him 10k while in Australia but my brother's weren't having any of it and chewed him out. In the end, my mom told to return back home and just stay with them temporarily until the lease on their house (they rented it out for 2 years) is done.\n\n>what exactly have you done except live in your parent\u2019s house which benefits you and not your parents?\n\nI cook, I do chores, I help my mother out when I can and we prevent my dad from buying scammy things online. I had a near heart attack last week when he entered his credentials (credit card) into a fishy looking website. Lecturing him did nothing so I told my younger sister to keep a closer eye on him. I also clean and feed the cats. Although they're my responsibility so I make sure they're just there to comfort my dad after he's done with work. I can't move heavy stuff obviously, but if there's something that they need help with, and I am more than capable of doing so, I do so immediately.

I found out I was pregnant after applying for multiple jobs after quitting that toxic environment, 3 months later (which I still continued applying. I stopped applying and had to inform companies who offered roles to me quite late that I was heavily pregant then. They retract their offer and I took a break as per my older brothers suggestion). I'd say, I made the mistake of trusting my mom's words that I needn't have to pay for anything (wedding, bridal, photography, food) aside from rent.
