Parking a semi on a residential street is dangerous and against the rules Joe\u2019s for a reason. No reason you should risk injury to yourself or anyone else because he refuses to find proper parking for his rig.", "NTA. Most towns have codes prohibiting that. Call someone at your local town government and they can refer you to the people that do code enforcement.", "INFO: Is it just the cab of the semi? Or is it the whole thing?

He is supposed to be renting a space, and driving back to his house in his personal vehicle. If he can't afford that, he chose the wrong profession. He's making the street dangerous. Report him.", "NTA-makes it dangerous situation for drivers that can't see around his semi.", "NTA. I assume off-street parking means he's not allowed to park his work vehicle in the street overnight? Does the truck fit in his house's driveway? (Sorry if my questions are ignorant; I'm not a car person.) I'd call the town. You approached him nicely about how this hinders you leaving your own home and he responded rudely, so I wouldn't bother trying to work this out with him.", "Large tires on trucks and tractors tear up the edges of the roads, that's why they're not supposed to be on highways. Mention that to the city person who has to deal with repair and budget, you'll get some action.", "Blast from the past - when I was a child, my mother dealt with this behavior from our next-door neighbors. They were two brothers who each had a big rig and sometimes BOTH would be parked on a little residential street. Mom had to call law enforcement a LOT (they ticketed the neighbors each time) and pissed off the neighbors so bad that we got a restraining order against them. That was a very tense walk to the bus stop past their house for a few years.\n\nNTA. If they're breaking the law, call and report it.", "NTA-I can just imagine trying to back out the driveway and not be able to see what\u2019s coming down the street. I think it\u2019s a good idea to take it up with the town. You\u2019ve exhausted all other options. If there was a truck stop I would have told him to go park it there. I\u2019ve got a neighbor who also drives semis and he leaves his at a pay per day truck stop.", "NTA A residential street is not an appropriate place to park a semi because it creates an unsafe traffic environment. It limits views, as you mentioned, as well as makes it difficult for cars to travel through the narrow street. Additionally, it's unsightly. \n\nYour neighbor needs to arrange for an appropriate place to store his truck when he's not driving it.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*spiel", "Would it fit in his driveway?

You have asked him to move, due to safety concerns, and he refused. Have you called the company he drives for? If not, I would advise that as a next step. \n\nGet the company name and truck number, which should be visible on the truck. Google the company, call, and ask for someone in Safety. Explain the issue. Unless he's an owner- operator, the truck belongs to his company - they will make him move it to avoid having it ticketed and towed.\n\nIf THAT doesn't resolve the issue, call the city.", "NTA\n\nI don't know what the laws are in your area, but here, there's a five foot buffer for driveways. I've got that five feet on either side painted yellow, so people know not to park there. It's a $47 fine. If you have something similar, I might suggest painting it first. THEN call on it.", "If it's blocking your visibility, and asking them politely hasn't got any result, then yes I would consider reporting them - for the safety/visibility side of things more than the mere fact that they're parking a big truck on your road", "NTA if he's breaking the parking rules.  I know where I lived the town didn't allow semi trucks to park in residential streets,  there were designated commercial parking spots for them.", "It depends on the local ordinances.

I know all the residential streets in my area ban semi-trucks from even *driving* on the roads unless they are delivering something.\n\nOrnamental trees aren't illegal, what the neighbor is doing probably is.", "Depends on if semi-trucks are even allowed on residential streets.  My area, nope they aren't not even just the cab.  On street parking is allowed but not if you are a semi.", "It's an entirely local matter and every city or town has it's own ordinances.
