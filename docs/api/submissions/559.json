It saves them the money they asked her to save them. They\u2019re just weirdly opposed to the method itself. \n\nBut jeez, what the hell do they charge you for water there?

There are a lot more effective methods of communication than yelling. \n\nI used to live in California, USA, which had basically been in a drough for my entire life. So yeah, I've seen a ton of messages about conserving water. The most effective tip I can give you is yes, turn off the water. You don't have to bath out of a bucket, you just don't have to leave the water running while you spend 10 minutes rubbing shampoo through your hair. So turn the water on, get all wet, turn it off, soap & shampoo, turn water back on, rinse. A lot of the new shower heads have a \"pause\" button that cuts the water flow without turning it all the way off so it is easy to switch the water on and off. \n\nOr you can join a gym w showers, and just shower there instead.", "Going to go out on a limb and say this may be less of a bill issue and more of a 'taking out their frustration on a single person' issue. \n\nSounds like you're doing everything in your power to do your part and they're mad they lose their favorite target and scapegoat.

If it gets the results they want, less water usage, then why does it matter if you\u2019re using a basin? I legitimately don\u2019t understand. Rushing to shower the conventional way wasn\u2019t working; this is. That should be good enough.\n\nAlso, the yelling isn\u2019t appropriate. I think everyone is just stressed and lashing out, and that\u2019s why things have escalated as they have. But that doesn\u2019t make it okay for your dad to be shouting at you all the time.", "NTA Your solution is a good one. I have very long, and super thick hair.

If you can wash with hot water in a bucket (in the shower) and then turn the shower on to rinse that is a great solution. Everyone should try your tactic.

Does she not notice your dad's hostility? Maybe she's so used to him yelling that she doesn't understand why you take it so seriously. I'd talk to your mom and straight up ignore your dad when he yells: just agree with whatever he says, go \"absolutely, I'll keep that in mind\" and never give it a second thought...or go ask your mom for a second opinion.\n\nBut also, I don't think the showers are the only thing using up water, and it could be worth exploring: Is it the water or heating of the water that is expensive? Are your radiators waterheated? If it's the cold water that's expensive, your family is probably flushing away far more water than you use for showering in a day. As long as the toilet get flushed once or twice a day there really is no need to flush for just pee and paper. Are you using a dishwasher or a washing dishes in a sink/dishtub, or washing everything under running water?

You can get an inline valve that makes it quick and easy to pause your shower after you lather up, or after you put conditioner in your hair need to work it through, so that you can reduce your total amount of water usage while you shower. This can make a major difference and can be easier than turning off the shower with the normal valves that can make it hard to get the exact same temperature back again.\n\nThe water does not need to be running the entire time you're in the shower.\n\nYou should also ensure that you have the proper low flow shower head.", "NTA\n\nYour dad didn't pay the water bill, so he has no saying in it.

This is what I do.  I use a preshampoo (Mizani Wonder Crown but there are others on the market) that you put in dry hair.  I scrub that into my scalp and, when I get in, it lathers up and rinses leaving my hair clean. I throw conditioner in and leave it in while I wash my body. I rinse that out.

Mostly my Dad. \nHe shouts about basically anything he doesn't like and I have sensitive ears (asked audiologists about it, my pain threshold is quite low so my ears hurt when exposed to loud noises. Not that my ears are actually damaged) he conveniently still doesn't think I'm telling the truth about that even though professionals said that but that's a tangent. \nSo I can't deal with shouting. \nHe has an issue with me moving around the house at night because he's also up at that time and watching shows. \nIf I'm 2 minutes late with getting out of the living room at night I have hell to pay. \nHe has issues with how we manage the dogs. I made a \"happy hoodie\", which covers his ears and dampens noise, for my dachshund mix because he's absolutely terrified of thunder. And it calmed him down immediately. Though my Dad yells and insists we're creating the problem by giving him attention while he's scared. \nMy Dad is also pretty impossible to have any sort of debate related conversation with. If he disagrees he will shout to get his point across and not listen to reason. I've informed my Mom that I'm literally not allowed to have an opinion in this scenario. She isn't either. And sometimes it's about the most stupid thing. \nHe once screamed at me in the car because I corrected the terminology he was using when talking about a concept in my degree. That I am busy studying. He seems to think that he knows the answer to everything even if I've been studying at a tertiary level for 2 or 3 years at the time. He has no background in this topic whatsoever.\nHe also slams things when doing the dishes. We have a metal double sink in the kitchen and he throws cutlery into the metal as he washes them. \nI have a misophonia issue and a loud noises sensory issue and I asked him if he could just put the forks and co. In the holder straight instead of doing this. And just be careful with the dishes perhaps but sure enough I got screamed at about this as well and he insisted that I'm just trying to control him. \nBy some miracle eventually he stopped the cutlery thing. But he's still loud so I have to hide in another room with earphones and loud music to cope with it. \n\nWe all sat on this one chair, couch sofa thing, at dinner for a long time until he started passive aggressively sighing and glaring at me every time I reached out to get something from the table. \nSo I moved to the floor because I was sick of it.\nThen later cleared up an armchair for myself which I now sit at. It helps to be further away though because of the misophonia. He chews unbelievably loud. I have to keep things in my ears to cope with it.", "In what way would this get even? It only benefits them and isn't the most pleasant for me. I only care about not getting screamed at to be completely honest.", "I really don't think she does.", "No but my dogs live here. And being completely alone seems worse", "No. But all the Time inside the shower with the water off and water on combined is considered the time to take a shower", "It might if they haven't showered in a month.", "A lot of abusive parents control their children's shower habits in *exactly* this manner.", "\u2b06\ufe0f This. It\u2019s not going to matter if the OP shortens her use of the bathroom or the method of getting clean, her parents are going to find fault with her. Next, it\u2019s going to be about where she hangs her towel, how many times she uses a towel, how often said towel needs to get washed, etc.\n\nOP, as a student, do you have a gym or other campus facility you could use to shower?", "OP isnt contributing to the bills and money is tight.\n\n Sounds like although they support OP, they also resent it, and are taking it out in petty ways.", "Ugh, I'm so sorry to hear all of that.  In case you weren't aware, this is not normal.  It is abusive.  I hope you can find a way to move out sooner rather than later.\n\nand yes, they will complain about that too", "They bank on that to keep you under their thumb.  Alone is so much better.  The *peace* is just amazing.\n\nAlso, if you've grown up with this kind of overbearing people, try to live alone for at least 6 months or a year before you pair off with a partner.  When you spend so much time trying to appease others, you end up having no idea what YOU want.  (guess how I know this?)", "Just what I was thinking!", "That was my comment too.", "Nope. I do not. A lot of people asked this"]}
