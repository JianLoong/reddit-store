When I go out with my friends, we often stay right up until close because we get chatting and you really do lose track of time. But we also are polite, tip really well, and at least one of us is almost always observant enough to notice when the place starts emptying out and workers are starting their closing up duties. Then one of us says to the others, \"they're closing, let's clear out\" and we do just that. If we are so engrossed in our conversations (it's happened) that we don't notice, when we get the head's up it's time to beat it, we laugh, apologize, and then get the heck out. It is insanely rude to expect people to give up their free time just so you can have yours. Those moms were assholes. And I've had friends who do get snippy with staff about those sorts of things and those people don't get invited out again because it's rude and embarrassing.", "**NTA**, but be more direct (without being rude): *we do close at 7pm so I'll be back in 5 minutes for orders, so that you don't need to rush through your meal*.", "NTA. Fuck literally EVERYONE who expects a restaurant dining room to allow them to stay after closing. The last place I worked at we stopped taking orders 25min before closing. That gives us 15min to cook for the table, 10min for them to eat and gtfo. If they planned a \u201cmom\u2019s night\u201d they should\u2019ve checked your hours of operation.", "NTA. The goodbye was a little passive aggressive, so next time just keep being direct. Idgaf if they\u2019re moms trying to let loose a little or if they\u2019re in some other situation. You need to have respect for the people who work in an establishment that closes at a certain time.", "NTA. Entitlement like this is infuriating.", "NTA.. Your server made it clear to them that you closed at 7pm, they could've gone elsewhere. Instead of looking/asking for other places that were open later in the area, they purposely chose to inconvenience you.  Your manager isn't worried, so don't sweat it.", "Hint? I used to work in a restaurant and there was no hinting. When I dropped the checks at the last tables I'd tell them we're closing in X minutes, anyone still here after that better grab a broom!\n\nIt was a pretty laid back place, but still, customers like this deserve no gentility in the message.", "NTA\n\nMom here. Also a former waitress. They were rude to stay so late after being told the closing time. Next time, instead of hinting, firmly tell them within ear shot of someone else (to back you when they inevitably complain later) \u201cWe appreciate your business folks but it is now x minutes past closing time and we must ask you to leave. We are happy to provide boxes for any unfinished food!\u201d", "NTA. I come from a restaurant family. One of the mom's having to work at our restaurant would have booted these moms right out. The 4/5 review is just petty. As a side note: this is why Mother's Day is the worst in the service industry. I would rather work any other holiday. Just my opinion.", "NTA. You respond to the review is what you do. \"We are sorry you felt rushed, and there was some initial confusion over the hours, but we told you when you walked in that we closed at 7pm, and decided to stay open a little longer since we felt bad about the mix up. However, once you had stayed 30 minute past the closing time, yes, we started to clean and close up. We tried to be accommodating, but you did indeed take advantage of our good will.\" As long as your other reviews are good, people will be able to see this for what it is.", "I worked in a bar for some time during grad school. My favorite manager would turn the music off 10 to close as a warning, then 5 turn the lights on and say pay your tab, tip your server, and get the f out we're closing in 5.

What is it about being a parent that makes some assholes so entitled?", "NTA. sure, everyone deserves to enjoy some time off... you included. honestly, as someone who's been in the service industry for about a decade, I've done a lot worse than tell a coworker goodnight perhaps a little too loudly. you tried being polite! they didn't get the hint. try not to feel bad about it. \n\n(for the curious, there are steps involved in the process- I/my coworkers would lock the door at closing time or like 15-30 after depending on how many people are in the building. turn the music off about 15 minutes later, \"sorry it's on a timer!\". turn some of the lights off where the customers aren't sitting, \"sorry, it's also on a timer!\". start openly doing side work/closing work, etc. at my worst, I would directly tell them \"the last bus is at 11:whatever and I need to catch it, do y'all know how much longer you might be?\" so really, what you did was not bad at all lmao. oh also, all that was complete bullshit lmao, if you didn't guess)", "NTA but you should have been on them to get out from the time they got there. I don\u2019t work at a restaurant but we do work with the public. We make announcements 1 hour before closing, then at 30 minutes before, 15 minutes before, and 5 minutes before.

What if you and the other server were *\"just moms trying to pay bills and get back to your kids\"* but were held up because of these entitled women who didn't think the closing time rule applied to them?\n\nMan...I do not miss my time in hospitality because of stuff like this.\n\nDid they at least leave a decent tip? OF COURSE THEY DID NOT (I'm guessing)?", "Fuck them. Assholes like them are what make hospitality workers hate there lives fuck then again! They can\u2019t seem to get it into their little mommy peanut brains that you still have an hour of work to do after they leave and have been there most likely for over 10 hours. Fuck them.", "This is the problem with closing hours being advertised as they are.  As a restaurant, if you close at 7, it should mean you stop serving food at 7, stop allowing people in at 7, and people are expected to leave no later than 8.  If you want to close at 7, the closing hours should be listed as 6.  To say you close at 7, but still serve at 6:59 is ridiculous and unfair business practice.\n\nNTA, though.", "Or arrive with enough time to leave before we close smh", "Almost word for word what my boyfriend said to me after they left lol", "Right!

I made my voice louder so that the group would hear that staff was leaving since we were closed so that they would know it was time for them to leave. It was passive aggressive,  and I didn\u2019t really want to do it like that, but they basically ignored my server and did not show any signs of leaving.", "Since it was late the server that was waiting them and I was the only ones there, and since she had already tried I thought I would try something.", "Seriously though, if they were having \"so much fun\" that it being their \"fun mom night\" meant they didn't have to leave when the business closed, then don't go there. \n\nOr go, leave at closing, and go somewhere else. I worked retail for years, and would hate when people came in right at closing, and wouldn't leave forever.", "My favorite when I worked retail was getting on the PA and saying \"Good evening shoppers, our store has BEEN closed for over thirty minutes now. You need to come check out now before we close our registers and you won't be able to make your purchases.

I called campus security on a group of \\~15 students several times because they tried to stay past closing every night for a few weeks.", "That\u2019s part of the problem with the hospitality industry.

This industry is rough, and you're going to have a lot later nights ahead of you, especially in the kitchen. This situation allows for primo bonding with coworkers. Make sure you're ready to rock when the guests leave, but there's no harm in passing the time with a fun show or card game together to keep the mood light when you're waiting on someone else. Being a Chef is being a leader - show your coworkers what leadership looks like. It's truly the most annoying when guests can't take the hint, but alas, we live in a world where reading the room isn't the publics strong point.", "Right. So, once again, work on asserting yourself like a professional. You can\u2019t behave unprofessionally and then get upset when you get called out for it.", "Maybe it's a US thing, but most restaurants in the UK have a time they take orders till, and then a closing time after that.", "Lol, we turned up the music and made a good time out of cleaning up after they left.", "No one behaved unprofessionally lmao. You guys make things up as you go along. And no one got upset.", "I didnt get upset when I was called out, and we did try to be polite and let the group know we were now closed and they brushed us off.", "You can be more direct while also being polite. There are some great suggestions in the comments."]}
