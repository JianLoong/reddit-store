(I'm using \"rotation\" very loosely because it was usually just the 1 for working class people, lol.)\n\nWhite specifically came into fashion when Queen Victoria wore white to her own wedding in 1840, and the whole concept of \"wedding gowns\" is an invention of wealthy people showing off that they have enough money to buy an over-the-top gown they can afford to wear only once.\n\nFast-forward 180 years, and now you get poors like us arguing over whether or not it's okay to wear your best gown to your cousin's wedding, just because you happened to wear it at your own wedding-adjacent party that occurred 3 years after your own wedding, lol.", "Seriously!

I wore different jewelry and the dress had gloves which I wore for my reception, I didn't wear them at my cousin's wedding\n\nEdit- some people asking for what the dress looked like, I'll try to describe it. The closest I can think of is the black dress Margot Robbie wore to the Barbie premiere. Mine was pink, longer and more of a mermaid style instead of blown out with tuille. Slightly different shape. My cousin's wedding gown was an expensive, custom made one and she told us last year she was using the Barbie doll as inspiration.\n\nI thought it was a great design but I couldn't order custom one in time, so I found a similar dress at a store and got it tailored. (And my cousin's was white, mine obviously wasn't)\n\nEdit 2- clearing up confusion, I wore my dress at my reception first. My cousin was also kind of annoyed at me wearing that (to my own reception) but didn't say anything directly.\n\nI also took inspiration from the Barbie doll because I really liked the design but couldn't get a complete custom made one, so no it wasn't the same as my cousin's. Obviously hers white and mine pink, hers had crystals and mine used beads.", "The issue is the cousin was getting a custom made wedding dress and showed OP.

She copied it after her cousin told her about the dress she was getting made, but just changed it to pink, and wore a month before her cousin's wedding. OP is without question TA. \n\nYTA", "I came here with a pronounced bias against Bridezillas and an intrinsic need to conserve, reuse, recycle, etc. so I was predisposed in your favor. Then I looked up the Barbie dress Margot R. wore to a premiere.  That is a statement piece - and you knew your cousin was using that for her wedding dress design.  \n\nSo you, who have been married for a couple of years, found out *last year* that your cousin was going to have the Barbiesque wedding dress.  You admired it so you pulled together the dress in pink and scheduled your reception a month before her wedding.  Your cousin was visibly annoyed at your reception - and you knew it and you knew why.\n\nThen, **you showed up at her wedding wearing her wedding dress but in Barbie-Pink.**.  Yikes on bikes.

Apologize to your cousin.  **YTA.**", "Yes. And it gets even worse since the dresses are almost identical. OP purposely found a similar design. The biggest difference is that her dress is pink and her cousin's is white.

It's a little bit more problematic on OPs part, based on further info they gave in comments. I think saying that it's a wedding dress is not actually the reason why OP is an asshole and implying that it's only about reusing a dress is a distraction from the actual issue.\n\n I think the cousin was already miffed about the dress in question at OPs reception.\n\n\n1. The dress in question is a clone of the cousin's wedding dress, but a different (brighter) colour.\n2. It is not a coincidence that the two wedding dresses were similar. Cousin shared info about what they were planning a year ago and OP used it.\n\n\nI think cousin is deeply regretting sharing information about what they were planning, since OP got their version out first, sucked it up for the reception OP did, and then got frustrated when OP continued to rub it in that the bride's idea had been stolen. Bride in question had been excited about their wedding dress design and now gets to feel like a copycat at their own bloody wedding - and OP reusing the dress just hammers that point. People may have forgotten the similarities between the two events - but this way everyone can compare them nice and close.\n\nWearing pretty much the same dress as the bride but in a brighter colour - is an asshole move.

A nice pair of pants and a nice top is more than enough, but most women have multiple dresses to wear.
