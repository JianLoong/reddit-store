I\u2019ve wanted those since I got my first apartment. I get overwhelmed easily when I\u2019m looking at a lot of stuff at once, so the Oxo Pops make looking at a pantry much easier on the eyes/ mind. For that reason, I was really excited about getting them and wanted to treat them well so they\u2019ll last. \n\nWhen we got them I told my husband these are for dry food only, pantry storage only. No wet food, do not refrigerate / freeze. He said okay. When he puts them away he puts them on our tupperware shelf (there\u2019s really no where else to put them). I check with him to make sure he knows they are not tupperware, but dry food storage containers. He says he knows. He referred to them as tupperware in conversation, I stop the conversation to clarify, he says he knows, he just calls them that because it\u2019s easier. \n\nSo you can imagine my surprise when I open our fridge and see leftover spaghetti in an Oxo container. I let out an audible sigh and say (albeit loudly because my husband was in his office and I was in the kitchen) \nMe: \u201c[Husband], the Oxo containers aren\u2019t supposed to have wet food in them or go in the fridge.

I often forget things my husband tells me or asks me to do, and when he confronts me about it, I can get very defensive. Definitely not saying it\u2019s good to be that way, just trying to be honest. It made me so self conscious when my forgetfulness was brought up, because I wasn\u2019t always that way. I used to have a lot better of memory but after I got married I had pretty bad brain fog, I don\u2019t know if it was the poor diet we started out with or the hormonal birth control or both, but I felt like I had lost control of my mind in that way. So then every time I forgot something it made me feel awful and I would get so defensive because of that. \n\nBut it finally came to a head when I forgot to do something really important to where it made it so that we didn\u2019t have what we needed in a medical situation. My husband told me that it was hard for him to trust me with important things because he was afraid I would forget and that it would put us in a bad position. That shook me up and made me realize that I couldn\u2019t get away with just \u201cbeing forgetful\u201d, I had a problem and I needed to fix it. So I got a daily planner and wrote down everything I didn\u2019t want to forget. I need to text this person back? Write it down. Husband asked me to pick up lettuce while I\u2019m at the store? Write it down. And it has been so helpful and really put my mind at ease.\n\nThat is just my personal experience. I would recommend trying to communicate to your husband how you are feeling and the pattern you see. I think forgiveness is really important, but I also think that problematic patterns should always be addressed and resolved. For me it took the realization that my husband wasn\u2019t able to fully trust me because of my actions. It was my problem that was affecting our relationship, and I didn\u2019t want that to be the case anymore.\n\nI know that everyone is saying it, but if he isn\u2019t willing to take responsibility or see where you are coming from, couples counseling is a great option.
