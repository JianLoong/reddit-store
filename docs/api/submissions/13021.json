I have a younger brother (27m) whose relationship of 7 years ended three months ago. The reason of the break-up was that he cheated on his former girlfriend with the girl he is currently dating.\n\nHis former girlfriend was like a sister to me, we grew to be really close during these past 7 years and I was really disappointed on my brother he had done such a thing to such a sweet person. I was really excited to have this girl in my bridal party. Now she won't even be at the wedding for obvious reasons, and on top of that my brother expects me to invite his current girlfriend. I really don't want her there. Even if they had started dating in a \"normal\" way (like, not cheating) I'm not sure I would want to invite someone I met only a few months prior to the wedding day (I've been planning my wedding for longer than I've known this person!). Also knowing that this new girlfriend really hurt my \"ex-sister-in-law\" and the fact that she is the main reason she won't be there not there, would make me really mad and sad every time I saw her at the reception. I'm so mad at my brother too, cause what he did is awful. The only reason he is still in the wedding list is because I know my mother will start drama if I don't invite him.\n\nI don't think I'm the a-hole, but my brother and my dad are calling me a bridezilla and my mother is telling me I'm ruining the day for her.

You don\u2019t know this woman, and what you do you know about her doesn\u2019t show her character in a good light. Not to mention that she\u2019ll probably be in photos, and do you want to look at photos years from now with some rando that cheated with your brother in them. Who knows if their relationship that was built on betrayal will even last.", "NTA but you could seat her at a table with lots of single men and let nature take its course.\n\nIts your brother who is the AH.  He was in the LT relationship and cheated on his GF.  He probably was too chicken to end the lt relationship .  Is he one of those people who always has to be in a relaitonship  and waits for the next lilly pad to hop to?", "NTA. I\u2019d invite the former gf and still have her in the wedding party. If your brother doesn\u2019t like it, too bad- don\u2019t go to the wedding then. But there\u2019s no reason for her not to attend your wedding when she\u2019s someone you\u2019re close to and care about a lot", "NTA OP.  I would have an off-duty cop there, just in case brother dearest and his gf try starting any drama.  Same goes for the rest of your family; that way, if anything happens, all the cop has to do is throw them out on their buttocks.", "Your mother is telling you that you\u2019re ruining the day for HER? YOUR wedding day? JFC\n\nAnd let\u2019s not even talk about your brother and dad! Your parents seem to be the reason your brother is an AH.\n\nNTA, tell your mum to get over herself and be there FOR YOU, this is not about her or her precious son.", "No g/f going .nor am I. Seriously what's the big deal.its your brother.as for the ex it takes 2 tango.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t think you should invite anyone to your wedding you don\u2019t want there. \nYou don\u2019t have to accept any of imposter gfs as your SIL you divorce the person not the family at least that\u2019s how my family thinks once you\u2019re in you\u2019re in for life.", "Oh you\u2019re ruining the day for mom huh? SMDH Mom needs to get a grip. I don\u2019t blame you one bit, I\u2019d feel the same way. NTA", ">my mother is telling me I'm ruining the day for her.\n\nOkay and the day is for her? Oh wait no that's right it's YOUR day. NTA they can suck it up.", "ESH- the only reason I\u2019m pinging OP is because her brother deserves a plus one. She shouldn\u2019t dictate who it is BUT dang the brother sounds scuzzy. Also you\u2019re not a bridezilla. This is a moral dilemma, not a bride who\u2019s upset about cake.", "NTA. It's your wedding, invite whoever you want. It's not about your family, it's about you and your significant other. And to quote Dr. Phil, \"If they'll do it with you, they'll do it to you\". This new girlfriend probably won't last.", "NTA. His invite doesn't need to include a +1. Or don't invite him at all. Your mom needs to back off, it isn't her wedding to ruin or not. Maybe she wants to be disinvited too.", "NTA. I'm a little tipsy and I grew up in a functional immediate family so these kinds of posts are like in Tarzan when the gorillas find the camp.\n\nAre your parents like...not at all disappointed in him? If I cheated on a partner, my parents, while still loving me of course, would be super disappointed because they raised me better than that.", "NTA", "NTA. Also, I'd be tempted to uninvite bro altogether to get ex-SIL in instead. Would def make for the most drama though.", "Wow its your day and you can invite who you want I wouldn't want the ap there either it would ruin my day to and your family should suck it up if your brothers not happy he can stay home with the homewrecker, and let his ex have a nice day but if I'm honest by the sound of it your family might make her feel unwelcome", "NTA. Frankly, I might be tempted to push it to the point that your brother refuses to attend, as well. That way your friend, his Ex, can feel free to be there.\n\n(But, my judgement may be a bit impaired, at the moment. So, I\u2019m not necessarily suggesting that you *should* push it to that point. If it gets there without pushing- by just standing your ground? Well . . .  his choice, I guess. He does seem to have a habit of making poor ones.", "NTA. It's actually your day. You feel like you feel, but you can't pick your relatives. It's his life... and he's your brother. He'll always be in your life... the ex will get a new life and move on.", "absolutely NTA. and your mother says youre ruining the day for HER? this is your day, invite who you want and dont invite who you dont", "NTA I hate cheaters, your brother broke more then just his exs trust when he did that", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice of guests. F the home wrecker. F your brother for having the audacity. F your parents for enabling their poorly raised son. They are all AHs. Do not let that girl near your wedding. Stand your ground.", "NTA, and too fracking bad if anyone is mad at you.  Your wedding, your guests, your decision.", "NTA\n\nAnd if you're still close to her, choose your sister over your brother. He doesn't need an invitation.", "NTA \n\n\n\nDon't invite brother", "i would say if he brings her, im getting on the mic and properly introducing her to the family and telling everyone exactly how it happened. NTA", "Need info. Who's paying for the wedding?", "NTA plus one\u2019s aren\u2019t a given.  Usually they go to married couples, engaged couples, and long term relationships.  These are the people in a few years you\u2019ll recognize in your photos.  When you cull the herd with limitations on plus ones it\u2019s for budget reasons or you just don\u2019t want some random person at your wedding.  If they are still together by the time your wedding is a month away then she should be invited only because it\u2019s your brothers GF and he\u2019s family.  If they\u2019re broken up then he doesn\u2019t need that plus one.  \n\nOn another note if you\u2019ve become close with the ex GF invite her as one of your friends.  You don\u2019t have to extend a plus one to her and she can choose if she wants to celebrate your day with you.\n\nJust because they aren\u2019t together anymore doesn\u2019t mean you guys are broken up too.  I wouldn\u2019t bring up your brothers new relationship as the reason.  Just tell him the way it is.\n\nWhat really got me is OP\u2019s mom saying she is ruining her day because she doesn\u2019t want the new GF at her wedding.   You\u2019re not a bridzilla for not wanting the flavor of the month in your wedding album.  She hasn\u2019t even made it to family holiday\u2019s so not being at the wedding isn\u2019t that big of a stretch.", "NTA. Tell your brother, father and mother if they don't stop being AH's you will do the following:\n\n***Un-invite your brother, and invite someone how will make your day way more enjoyable - his ex aka your beloved friend.***\n\nAnd if they don't pipe down then follow through with it.", "NTA. The conflict and tension are already there due to you not inviting the affair partner. You may as well uninvite your brother.\nYou have done nothing wrong and would be doing nothing wrong to uninvite him. It is your day. Not to mention, without him there, you can invite his ex.", "NTA!\n\nSo your mom thinks the day is about her. Your dad and brother think him having the company of his latest lover is more important than you (1) missing the presence of someone who has been important to you for the past 7ish years and (2) not having to include someone who you have a negative relationship with. Well, they are all a bunch of prize winners!\n\nIf you are up to standing firm, then do so without a bit of guilt. If, for whatever reasons, you end up including this person, just ignore her and focus on the people who make you happy.", "Even without all the drama, it\u2019s totally normal not to allow \u201cplus ones\u201d for people who haven\u2019t been dating long. 3 months and he wants you to invite her? Each guest can add hundreds of dollars in catering and drinks, depending on the wedding. Hell no. The fact that he cheated and hurt your friend/his ex in the process just adds to the reasons.", "First thing I want to say is she is not the main reason the ex will not be there\u2026 Your brother is! But that aside I understand why you wouldn\u2019t want either of them there but it\u2019s hard to uninvited your brother and it\u2019s easier to keep the peace with your family. Now to play devils advocate\u2026 a lot of times people get to bring guests to weddings and you don\u2019t usually control who those guest are meaning it\u2019s common for people to bring someone you have never met so saying you barely know her might not be as good of a reason to some as it is to you but at the same time it is YOUR wedding and you don\u2019t necessarily need a reason. It sounds like you made up your mind so I wouldn\u2019t worry about what people think too much but please remember that your brother is the one that chose to cheat on his ex and yes it takes two to tango but I don\u2019t personally know what she was told & even if she did know your brother was the one committed and ultimately he\u2019s the one that f\u2019ed it all up. Congrats on your engagement and I hope you have a wonderful wedding \u2665\ufe0f", "It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s her mother big day and not hers.", "This is what she should do. She clearly wants former SIL there more. The people she wants there definitely take priority over someone she doesn\u2019t want there at all.", "She doesn't want her brother there either. \n\nI say uninvite him, but let mum have a plus one, and she can bring him. It's just formalities but it does extend the fact that even he isn't really wanted there, just tolerated for someone else's sake, and that a plus one can't bring a plus one.", "How about OP\u2019s wedding budget, and she can decide on whom to spend it?\n\nDoes u/Prior_Bodybuilder_57 have any parameters on who gets a +1? When my friends got married, their rule was married, engaged, or living together. This eliminates anyone dragging in some random or boy/girlfriend of the moment, and, yes, it applies to family, too.", "Get all the way off her back? Wowowowowow", "Seems pretty clear who the favorite child is", "Unless the side chick knew he had a gf...new girl doesn't get a pass just because he couldn't keep it in his pants.", "She\u2019s still with him knowing she ruined a 7 year relationship and he cheated on his gf for her meaning that she doesn\u2019t care. Fuck both of them.", "personally i may even go as far as inviting the ex since it sounds like your relationship was a lot more than just being your brothers gf, but i can see how that may cause a lot of drama", "I can imagine Oprah excitedly telling each of them \"You get un-invited to the wedding! You get un-invited to the wedding! You all get un-invited to the wedding!\"", "You're a good person, my argument would be \"judging by the actions that introduced her to our family I don't think she holds the values to partake in a celebration of love and commitment; neither does you btw so I suggest you stop pestering me and get your act together\".", "Your wedding your rules, but what if mom and dad are laying out most or all the $ for their only daughters wedding? Sure, still your rules, but you better be willing to pick up the tab with all the talk of uninviting the parents. And unless you have kids approaching wedding age, you don't really know the emotional impact to a parent when their only daughter gets married. It IS a big day to parents of the bride.\n\nBride is NTA, but maybe she should have a heart to heart with her brother. She seems more vested in the old GF then her brother. I'm not condoning cheating, but if he cheated after 7 years, something is up, or that relationship was already long dead. Not an excuse! Be a man/woman and end it. But whatever the story, discuss it.", "fair point, added some clarification.", "Ma'am or Sir you are exactly my level of petty and I am HERE FOR IT for this one.", "Mom seems way too mentally invested in the wedding. Your guests are those that you and your fiance choose, not your mom's choices. I wouldn't invite such a short term acquaintance either, and they could well not be together by the time of the wedding.", "OP should keep Her Friend (brothers ex) in bridal party especially  since brother probably isn\u2019t coming anyway", "Right?", "Since she doesn\u2019t seem to want him there either, that seems like plus.", "It sounds like OP is okay with that, as she invited him to prevent their mom from throwing a warbler.", "If ut were me I'd be hoping he would skip it, 2 birds 1 Stone\n\nOp is nta", "I hope he doesn\u2019t steamroll and bring the mistress anyways", "/u/Ordinary_Roldsfg is a bot that stole this comment: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zvadi/aita_for_not_wanting_my_brothers_new_girlfriend/jdee5oz/", "And she made the choice to be apart of it. She\u2019s not innocent.", "Momzilla", "Lol, I took the \"her\" not to be her the mom, but her the gf in question--whoch also is a wtf statement.", "While normally I would tell someone with this idea to grow up, in this case this is absolutely PERFECT!  Especially with everyone bullying OP to invite the affair partner!", "That\u2019s how I read it. Stick to your guns OP.\nNTA."]}
