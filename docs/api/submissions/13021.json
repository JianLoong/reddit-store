I have a younger brother (27m) whose relationship of 7 years ended three months ago.

I was really excited to have this girl in my bridal party. Now she won't even be at the wedding for obvious reasons, and on top of that my brother expects me to invite his current girlfriend. I really don't want her there. Even if they had started dating in a \"normal\" way (like, not cheating) I'm not sure I would want to invite someone I met only a few months prior to the wedding day (I've been planning my wedding for longer than I've known this person!). Also knowing that this new girlfriend really hurt my \"ex-sister-in-law\" and the fact that she is the main reason she won't be there not there, would make me really mad and sad every time I saw her at the reception. I'm so mad at my brother too, cause what he did is awful. The only reason he is still in the wedding list is because I know my mother will start drama if I don't invite him.\n\nI don't think I'm the a-hole, but my brother and my dad are calling me a bridezilla and my mother is telling me I'm ruining the day for her.

You can totally ignore her if you want but being a good hostess means letting your guests decide who their plus 1 is, even if you don\u2019t know them or care to know them.

And if so, then yes YTA.  I get you're hurt, and what he did was wrong.  And why can't you invite his Ex?  Are you still friends with her?
