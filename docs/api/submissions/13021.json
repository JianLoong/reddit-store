I really don't want her there. Even if they had started dating in a \"normal\" way (like, not cheating) I'm not sure I would want to invite someone I met only a few months prior to the wedding day (I've been planning my wedding for longer than I've known this person!). Also knowing that this new girlfriend really hurt my \"ex-sister-in-law\" and the fact that she is the main reason she won't be there not there, would make me really mad and sad every time I saw her at the reception. I'm so mad at my brother too, cause what he did is awful.

Your mom had her wedding day. Your feelings are valid and you shouldn\u2019t have to feel sad on your wedding day. It\u2019s really weird that your family is so supportive of a cheater. My parents would be embarrassed if I was a cheater. They wouldn\u2019t be advertising at a family wedding.", "NTA\n\n\"We're only inviting partners of 2+ years aka long term partners. We cant wait to get to know her better at other events\"", "NTA. But you should still invite the \"sweet person\" who is \"like a sister to \\[you\\]\". Why punish her again for your brother's transgression?", "NTA your brother hurt his ex not his new gf. But your wedding, your guest list", "Honestly op NTA and I'd disinvite my brother to the wedding for even suggesting that.", "NTA, \n\nThe day is for YOU and no one else. I say just uninvite bro and mom and dad if they can't respect your choices (like your bro can't respect women apparently) and invite your \"ex-sister-in-law\" instead. \n\nThis day is for you to celebrate with people that make you HAPPY, not people that put stress on you, disappoint you, or make you anything but happy.", "NTA. Your family are. Reread what you just wrote: your mother is telling you *you* are \"ruining the day for her.\" \"The day\" being *your wedding*. That's all anyone needs to know about your mother,\\* and clearly the less is said about your brother the better. \n\n\\* I know, because when I was 17 and lost my virginity, my mother threw a fit. She didn't like my boyfriend and didn't like how the whole thing happened, because that wasn't how she pictured *my first time*. She screamed at me for *ruining it for her*. Yours sounds similar.", "Has your family always been completely selfish? NTA \n1) it\u2019s not Mother\u2019s Day, it is YOUR day! Her feelings are irrelevant and she should be a decent mother and support your decisions for YOUR wedding day.\n2) you don\u2019t want a home wrecker coming to your wedding, especially considering the home she wrecked was of a good friend of yours. That is an understandable boundary and don\u2019t let anyone including your family try to tell you otherwise. I wouldn\u2019t put it past someone like her to try to wreck the home of the bride and groom while at the wedding! (That last sentence may be overreacting, but still from the beginning she is clearly not a very trustworthy person)\n3) if anyone thinks you\u2019re the AH for not inviting someone (not that you even need an excuse because it\u2019s your wedding and your choice, but this is a very good reason to not invite this person) simply explain to them that they do not have to attend the wedding if they wish to cause drama over it, but that you will not be made to feel guilty for setting a much needed boundary and will not be forced to invite people you do not want around on YOUR WEDDING DAY. \n\nYes I know the all caps may be annoying, but need to make it clear that it\u2019s your day. Well yours and the groom of course.", "NTA. But, how dare you ruin YOUR wedding for your mom? Clearly this is her wedding and you're just....there. Invite whoever you want there. If it were me, I'd invite your \"sister\"(since she's not with your cheating brother, no reason to keep the \"in-law\" part) and not him. Tell your mom she can accept your choices or she can stay home with her son and the homewrecker.", "Because of course it\u2019s your mom\u2019s day, not yours.. NTA at all. It\u2019s your wedding and you get to decide who is invited. Tell your brother if he keeps bothering you he\u2019ll be disinvited too", "NTA. It's not your mother's day and since she's already causing drama you may as well just go for the hat trick and tell your cheating brother to gtfo with his side piece.", "NTA. Stand firm.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA - your wedding and if he is not happy about it, he can stay home. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry, Ma, *whose* day is being ruined???", "NTA- your day, your rules. Easy as that", "NTA. We just found the golden child - your brother!! Let your Mom know that her day can be ruined, but yours will not, and the new girlfriend is not invited. End of discussion.", "NTA. \n\nYour brothers ex was your friend, this girl and your brother hurt her. You shouldn't have to have her at your wedding, particularly so soon after the fact", "NTA, but I don\u2019t know why you can\u2019t have the ex girlfriend as a bridesmaid? If she\u2019s your friend, why don\u2019t you have her as a bridesmaid?", "Jesus! Tell your family you are allowed to have your feelings and they need to back off! The wedding is 6 months away, that\u2019s a long time. Who knows if your brother will even be with this girl then. Tell them all to back off and if she\u2019s still with your brother 5 months from now then invite her.", "Nta \n\nThis is your day and your soon to be husbands day.\n\n I'm getting married in 7 months and I'm sorry the last thing I would want to see. Is my brother with the girl he cheated with. I just wouldn't want those vibes at my wedding.", "NTA only fianc\u00e9 or spouses get invites from here on out.", "Nta- your bro and gf are . You\u2019re the bride you can invite whoever you want. And you don\u2019t want this home wrecker at your wedding. Enjoy your day and congratulations on your upcoming nuptials.", "NTA.  Take this as the gift that they are giving you, they are upset anyway, no matter what, so just don't let him be there either and have a lovely wedding that you want.", "NTA It's your wedding if you don't want this woman there then you shouldn't have to. The only one who's ruining the day for your mother is your mother. Go and have a happy day without the drama your family is trying to create for you.", "NTA.", "NTA. First of all, it is your wedding. You make the rules. Second, since the new girlfriend was the cause (mainly) of the breakup, that would be an additional reason to not want her to be there. That is a tragic situation. Sorry it happened.", "NTA and sorry but your entire family sucks if they can't let you have one day.. like seriously more than your dad or brother your mom saying your ruined HER day lol \n\nThe audacity. I would revoke their invites but I'm petty.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA- your wedding, your rules. If your brother or other family members decide not to attend because his mistress wasn\u2019t invited, that\u2019s their choice.", "NTA \n\nYour wedding day is about you and your fianc\u00e9 starting your lives together, it makes sense that you don't want both cheaters there. Tell your brother he's lucky that he is even still invited.", "For real. Like she's the effen bride.", "OP sounds like a lot better person than the rest of her family.", "Agreed! And OP, get a trusted friend to be on the look out and kick out your brother when he inevitably brings the new girlfriend to your wedding.", "And I would use the argument that \u201cmy wedding is not going to be the family event to introduce your new gf aka your affair partner to the extended family\u201d. There is a time and a place and your wedding doesn\u2019t have to be it. Especially when you don\u2019t approve of the relationship. NTA", "I'd already be disinviting. Brother for even asking me to bring her, mom for telling me I'm running my day for her, and dad for calling me a bridzilla.  Your outta here ill use the money for catering to hire a bouncer.", "That sounds like the way to go, honestly. OP said she is only inviting her brother because her mother would give her a hard time, but her mother is already giving her a hard time so at this point she might as well invite the person she actually wants there, the ex gf.", "Yes! Op, do this! \ud83d\ude02", "Throw the whole family away.", "And if he chooses not to go, the former SIL CAN!!! I see that as a WIN WIN!", ">*Let\u2019s see if this woman is still around in 6 months but I wouldn\u2019t invite her either*. \n\nMy first thought, too.  \n\nThere's an etiquette solution you could use, OP, presuming that you haven't already sent the official invitations.\n\nDon't give your brother or anyone else a plus one.  Instead, send an invitation to each person who is invited.  If a couple is living together you could probably put both names on the envelope.  If they live separately, then each should have an invitation sent to their address.\n\nThis is more cost and fuss than doing a plus one, but it gives you greater control of the guest list.  A \"plus one\" can't be switched around at the last minute if there are no plus ones.\n\nIf your brother is living with this person when you marry you can still send an invitation just to him.\n\nThink about having a seating chart and seating place marks, too, at your reception.  The last wedding I went to was large, with no specified seating.  It was complete chaos.\n\nYour mother is way, way out of line defending her dear boy.  Stay strong.\n\nNTA", "I'd disinvite my mom when she said that too .... then agin my family knows and would be silent about this. This is OP's day and mom needs to keep her feelings to herself. It's not about her.", "The mom: \u201cand I took that personally\u201d", "It's YOUR wedding, you're allowed to curate the guest list. Of course, your brother is also allowed to skip it, so don't be shocked if that's the case", "Or...push it one more notch.\n\nBrother is invited.\n\nSo is former SIL. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe can of course not go.", "It can and has. I\u2019ve been in therapy for it and have made a lot of positive strides in moving that energy towards the right kind of chaos and also learning to sit with the calm. Thank you", "But if anybody starts any bull while there, they get the boot.", "That's awesome! good on you for that growth! \n\nYou're welcome : )"]}
