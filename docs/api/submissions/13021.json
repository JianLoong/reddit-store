I have a younger brother (27m) whose relationship of 7 years ended three months ago. The reason of the break-up was that he cheated on his former girlfriend with the girl he is currently dating.\n\nHis former girlfriend was like a sister to me, we grew to be really close during these past 7 years and I was really disappointed on my brother he had done such a thing to such a sweet person. I was really excited to have this girl in my bridal party. Now she won't even be at the wedding for obvious reasons, and on top of that my brother expects me to invite his current girlfriend. I really don't want her there. Even if they had started dating in a \"normal\" way (like, not cheating) I'm not sure I would want to invite someone I met only a few months prior to the wedding day (I've been planning my wedding for longer than I've known this person!). Also knowing that this new girlfriend really hurt my \"ex-sister-in-law\" and the fact that she is the main reason she won't be there not there, would make me really mad and sad every time I saw her at the reception. I'm so mad at my brother too, cause what he did is awful. The only reason he is still in the wedding list is because I know my mother will start drama if I don't invite him.\n\nI don't think I'm the a-hole, but my brother and my dad are calling me a bridezilla and my mother is telling me I'm ruining the day for her.
