During my last year of college, I was offered a small job as a blog writer from a staff member. I wrote blog posts on various topics for a couple months, until I graduated. I actually never saw any of my blog posts until today, when I decided to apply for a writing gig. This gig that I\u2019m currently applying for requires me to submit links to works that I have written. I decided to go to the website I wrote for and saw one of my blog posts. However, I saw that the staff member put the wrong author on the post, as the name for the author was not mine. I have a draft of the original post, which is identical to the blog post so I am 100% sure that I am the author. WIBTA if I contacted the staff member and ask them to change the author to my name even though it\u2019s been months since the blog was posted? At the same time I feel kind of petty since it\u2019s been months since the post was published.", "created_utc": 1667115929, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yh86e0/wibta_if_i_ask_editor_to_change_the_author_name/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
