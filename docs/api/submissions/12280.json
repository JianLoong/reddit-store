Many areas have tenants rights that after so long that it's even harder than hell to kick them out.\n\nIf you choose to let them stay make them sign a contract of how long it would be beforehand that way it covers you and give a specific date on when they have to be out", "NTA, you\u2019ve spent 14 years making it your home\n\nPretend you don\u2019t know they\u2019re wanting to stay- as you said, it won\u2019t be temporary", "NTA It was their decision to move to North America to an expensive city. They are responsible for working out their living arrangements before the move just like everyone else moving someplace new. \n\nYou have no obligation to help them out. The potential downside could be terrible.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility. They are making a life changing decision and need to be prepared to handle the consequences of that action. Understandable they would want to live with someone of a similar background and as you mentioned it may not be for a few weeks, if could turn to months or years. Additionally, you don\u2019t know these people too well (friend of a friend). You could be putting your entire family at risk and yourself", "NTA at all. Unless they ask directly, continue to play dumb.", "NTA. It's a huge decision to invite a family to live with you until they get settled. No doubt, there are other ways to help without turning your family's life upside down.", "Nta your family comes first. You can still help without putting your family out", "Nta, even if they they plain out ask, you are still not obligated to say yes.", "NTA. Your privacy is yours. If you don't want it I posed say so and move on", "You're not required to invite people to stay with you, so, NAH", "NTA- You need to do what is comfortable for you.   Just because someone wants something, doesn't mean they will always get it.", "NTA - you have to protect your children it might sound bad but having strangers around my kids makes me nervous\u2026 especially if your kids are young! Play dumb and if asked straight up just decline but offer help in another way!", "NTA. \n\nThere are many many many other places to move with a lower COL. Your friend's friend can stay with her and you can visit. \n\nProtect your nuclear family and your home, and be clear about why.  Pretending to not get the hint is passive aggressive and a lie.  Be kindly honest that it's not the best arrangement, and if they get mad - who cares. It's a massive imposition.", "NAH: It's perfectly reasonable for you not to want guests for a few weeks (or however long that winds up actually being). It's also reasonable for your family friend to want to have a bit of a transitional phase when coming to a new city.\n\nIf you do want to help them without hosting, maybe you could help them find a place in your city or host the parents for a weekend or 2 while they apartment search.", "NAH. There's nothing keeping them from being near you or other members of the community if they want help or a connection to their home while they're moving. It's probably pretty scary for them.\n\nHowever you don't know all of them very well, I assume, and neither does your family. This could make a miserable experience for all 8 of you and could make their transition even worse. It's far better for them to move into a temporary housing situation rather than make the experience potentially even more confusing for their children.\n\nPretending to not get the hint is a polite way to avoid hurting their feelings, but if they press the issue be honest that you aren't comfortable with it. And honestly it's probably not advisable even if you were.", "NTA I wouldn't offer either.\n\nYou can always offer them over for dinner or bring them a nice home cooked meal to help them out during their move. But housing them? Nah I wouldn't either.", "NTA. Nice if you could. But you can't. You and your family come first. Point them in the right direction and give them the information needed if possible.", "NTA  Think of it this way assuming your family are not immigrants then by offering them a place to stay would go against their wishes. There would only be one immigrant versus 3 who are not.", "Hi.\n\nYou are completely NTA. Its good that you know that is never \"just a few weeks\" is going to be months. Specially with this days rent cost and in a expensive city. And they are not even your friends. They are gonna be strangers in your home with your kids (please correct me if I am wrong).  \n\n\nI am an immigrant too and even if its hard when you just arrive is no one obligation to help. You can invite them for dinner once (if you are comfortable with it), show them the city or maybe let them know other places that can help them. Its their choice to move, its their choice to go to an expensive city. They should know and plan accord to it.   \n\n\nNote: English is not my first language, sorry for any mistakes.", "NTA and if you are not comfortable with strangers coming to stay, you have no need to open your home. If this was something you WANTED to do then awesome, but you have your home and family to keep safe and discomfort-free.\n\nAlso staying for a few weeks after coming over from another country... will absolutely not be for a few weeks.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
