She probably just wants to share a milestone birthday with you and feels a bit miffed that it won\u2019t be just you and your family.\n\nIf you really are only playing every few weeks, ask her if there\u2019s anything else going on or if there\u2019s something you need to talk about. There might be something else going on.", "NTA. Your wife is being selfish; she wants to let you do what you want, but only if she likes it, too? That's not a gift, that's a test. If she feels \"left out\" by spending ALL DAY with her and your family, then letting you fo your own thing for a few hours, maybe she has some issues.", "I mean, she can play D&D too with you? That would be a great present.\n\nOr she can give her suggestions, and you can see if any would be as fun as D&D.\n\nCause I'll be honest, I super miss playing and unless my partner was promising hedonistic sex for a few hours, D&D tops my list of fun things to do.\n\nNTA", "nah not really I mean, it is YOUR birthday so YOU should choose what YOU want to do. happy bday btw.", "So\u2026essentially you said you want to spend 7am -  7pm with her and the kids, and then spend a few hours gaming with your friends, and her response is that she\u2019s hurt you don\u2019t want to spend your birthday with her?\n\nLady, he\u2019s just spent THE WHOLE DAY with you!!\n\nNTA\n\nI would have zero issues with my husband suggesting a birthday celebration plan like that. \n\n(It\u2019s HIS birthday, I\u2019d suck it up even if he wanted to spend the whole day doing something separately from me. e.g. mountain biking with his friends. But to suggest a whole day with me and then an evening hanging out with friends? There is absolutely nothing wrong with that request.)", "NTA. It's your birthday. You get to spend it how you choose.", "Your wife is upset that you told her exactly how you would like to spend YOUR BIRTHDAY?\n\nNTA.", "Yta - you spend most nights playing the switch but you're acting like you just never have any free time. You play every 3 weeks - that's more than some people without kids get to do.", "ESH\n\nYour wife asked you what you wanted to do, and you told her, and it's a bit AH to make a fuss on your birthday.\n\nBut...  Spending time with your wife and kids is not a substitute for 1:1 time with your wife.  Time in bed is not a substitute for actual 1:1 activities being shared.  If she's feeling like the role of \"mother\" is taking over her life, at the expense of time just enjoying being your partner, that's a problem. \n\nMaybe stretch your birthday celebrations over two days, and get a babysitter on the weekend and have a nice dinner/movie/show/other activity with your wife, to celebrate that part of your life together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Highly recommend.\n\nSecond, don't over commit yourself - as a person who last year celebrated 40 I know that a full day out then a night of socialisation is not easy. For your own sake I'd recommend doing d&d another night.", "NTA. I just planned my husband's 39th birthday. He wanted to play board games (Like Gloomhaven, Wrath of the Lich King, ect.). I got all of his friends together and picked up queso and chips. He says it was one of his best birthdays. I was there too, of course, as I assume your wife would be. So, she would be spending time with you.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you want to spend.... 80% of your birthday with your wife and kids? (12 hours with the fam, guessing 8pm bedtime for the kids, and then a 3 hour DnD sesh, which is about what we can fit in before one of the parents in the party falls asleep.)\n\nI wonder if your wife was expecting/hoping for a different answer, and isn't handling it well.", "NTA it's your birthday, she should be generous of heart.", "NTA - you already said you want to spend the day with her and the kids.       \nCan she not handle a few hours without you on YOUR birthday ?        \nIs everything always about her ?", "NTA you are spending your birthday with her. Your waiting until the kids are in bed to start the game. That\u2019s all day. Happy birthday!", "Thank you!", "Uh\u2026 no.  You pretended to want to spend the day with your family, then you want to do what you want at night. That\u2019s a reasonable birthday. \n\nIf your wife wants you to give it to her good, you can do that before and/or after your birthday.  \n\nAbsolutely NTA."]}
