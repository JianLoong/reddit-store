He\u2019s completely different now than he used to be", "How", "> He\u2019s a homebody\n\nMe too but I would NEVER talk to my wife that way.  I don't even know you and I can tell you you deserve better.", "*<I have a demanding full time job along with being the primary parent/caregiver. After getting ready for school, kids on busses, doing some work and getting myself showered and dressed, he is still asleep at 8.39am. I\u2019d heard his alarm go off and be shut off several times an hour before so I assume he doesn\u2019t want to go - and I leave at 8.40am as planned.>*\n\n*<He calls me a selfish scumbag, selfish bitch, and a loser in a barrage of texts - said I only care about myself>*\n\nEver heard the term DARVO? (Deny, Attack and Reverse Victim and Offender)\n\nI don't think you need advice from Redditers.\n\nI think you need a good divorce lawyer.", "Info: why aren\u2019t you as horrified as the other readers of your post are at the way he speaks to you? Is this typical of how he speaks to you? \n\nBecause it absolutely shouldn\u2019t be.", "Honey he's abusive. Leave him.", ">He\u2019s a homebody\n\nNo, he just an AH. A homebody does not mean purposefully missing key events in your family's lives. He just doesn't care. \n\nWhen faced with the consequences of his own actions, he berates you. What a bum father and husband. NTA. But I hope you continue to assert your self worth and the value of your kids and make it a hill to die on.", "Nothing in the world could make up for the fact that he's verbally abusive to you. You deserve so much better. \n\nAlso, your kids are learning that this is an acceptable way to treat a loved one. Would you ever want someone talking to your child the way he speaks to you?", "So he does the bare minimum expected of a functioning adult and that gives him the right to call you a b*tch? \n\nHave some self respect girlypop.\n\nNTA. But consider what you're allowing your children to grow up around.", "NTA But since he is a homebody and you aren\u2019t, tell him he doesn\u2019t have to go with you. Let him off the hook. His refusal to be on time means he doesn\u2019t want to go, especially since you have actually missed events. When you give him dates and times then leave without him, he feels justified by blaming you rather than admitting he has sabotaged it himself. Tell him he can stay home without any guilt because you want him to feel comfortable and not pressured to attend a social event. If he wants to go great, post the event, date and time on the refrigerator and make your own plans. If you are the one who has to take an Uber or cab and leave him the car if he feels like showing up, do that. But let him know it is his decision to come if he wants or not. Tell him you are thinking of his comfort only and aren\u2019t upset, even if you are. \n\nYour children are going to realize that their dad is not interested in their activities, and they are the ones who will remember that in the future. But it is better that they don\u2019t hear the threats and name calling that is going on now.", "His chronic lateness is another aspect of abuse.  Just not verbal.", "So right now your kid has to deal with your husband 100% of the time. You may take the brunt of the abuse, but your kid sees it. After a divorce, your kid could spend at least 50% of their time in a home without any verbal abuse.", "I totally understand this, it's one of the main reasons my father didn't leave my abusive mother until I was an adult. On Reddit it tends to be rather black and white - divorce or nothing. I want you to think about the shades of grey. This is not a healthy relationship for you or your children, and it will leave lasting effects on all of you. Is leaving a possibility (for whatever reason - financial, kids, etc)? If not, what can you do to mitigate the harm that's being done to you and your kids right now? Don't reply to me with the answers to these questions, but think about what this would look like for you. I would start to educate yourself (if you haven't already) on abuse - what it looks like, what the fallout of growing up in an abusive home looks like, ways to set boundaries and attempt to minimise the damage that's being done right now. A good therapist could help with this if you have the funds for it and think that you could attend safely. I don't want you to underestimate the situation you're in right now. Too frequently abuse becomes so normalised that you can't see it when you're in the middle of it. None of these options will end up being perfect, but I think you owe it to your children to start thinking about all these things. Good luck from this internet stranger. I truly wish you the best and hope that you find your way out.", ">He\u2019s worse when I\u2019m not around\n\nSo does he talk to your children like that as well?", "As an adult whose mom probably thought this way, I can tell you now they will NOT thank you for this.  Instead you staying with him will make them question their relationship with you.", "*So document everything.*", "I felt this way too; that my now ex would be at best disengaged & neglectful as a single father & at worst, he\u2019d be terrifying & abusive & the kids wouldn\u2019t have me as a barrier if I left him. I still don\u2019t know how I might better have handled things, as the courts would have given him visitation until he harmed them, which was an out of the question scenario to me, but do know that I set a terrible example to the children as to how a marriage should be, how much sh*t Mom tolerated & how NOT to treat people in general, family in particular. Please, see an attorney quietly & get good advise on extracting yourself & your family members (don\u2019t leave the animals) safely!", "He contributes substantially financially, and does the cooking and cleaning...that is NOT the bare minimum!", "Me too and I wouldn't talk to my dog that way much less my husband", "I love this response. OP, read this!!!!", "Brava, you stated exactly what OP should do!", "Yeah it is.", "That is the bare minimum\u2026"]}
