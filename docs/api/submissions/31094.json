His refusal to be on time means he doesn\u2019t want to go, especially since you have actually missed events. When you give him dates and times then leave without him, he feels justified by blaming you rather than admitting he has sabotaged it himself. Tell him he can stay home without any guilt because you want him to feel comfortable and not pressured to attend a social event. If he wants to go great, post the event, date and time on the refrigerator and make your own plans. If you are the one who has to take an Uber or cab and leave him the car if he feels like showing up, do that. But let him know it is his decision to come if he wants or not. Tell him you are thinking of his comfort only and aren\u2019t upset, even if you are. \n\nYour children are going to realize that their dad is not interested in their activities, and they are the ones who will remember that in the future.

After a divorce, your kid could spend at least 50% of their time in a home without any verbal abuse.", "I totally understand this, it's one of the main reasons my father didn't leave my abusive mother until I was an adult. On Reddit it tends to be rather black and white - divorce or nothing. I want you to think about the shades of grey. This is not a healthy relationship for you or your children, and it will leave lasting effects on all of you. Is leaving a possibility (for whatever reason - financial, kids, etc)? If not, what can you do to mitigate the harm that's being done to you and your kids right now? Don't reply to me with the answers to these questions, but think about what this would look like for you. I would start to educate yourself (if you haven't already) on abuse - what it looks like, what the fallout of growing up in an abusive home looks like, ways to set boundaries and attempt to minimise the damage that's being done right now. A good therapist could help with this if you have the funds for it and think that you could attend safely. I don't want you to underestimate the situation you're in right now. Too frequently abuse becomes so normalised that you can't see it when you're in the middle of it. None of these options will end up being perfect, but I think you owe it to your children to start thinking about all these things. Good luck from this internet stranger.

You have different ideas of social interaction, where one sees being on time as important and another doesn\u2019t care if you get there at all.
