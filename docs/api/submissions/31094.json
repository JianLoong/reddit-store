You're the primary caregiver? He's calling you a selfish bitch? Girl this is awful and way more of a problem than just his inability to be on time. NTA but uh lawyer.", "NTA\n\nNo idea why he is still your husband if he speaks to you like that.  \n\nThere is literally no excuse for that kind of poor time management.  I get that some people find it more difficult than others but it is not impossible.  If he isnt willing to even try then I dont see why you should make the effort for him.", "What. The. Hell.\n\nScrew the judgement. OP, if this is real, why in the HELL are you with this man? It is simply NOT acceptable for your spouse to call you names and verbally abuse you like this. Not to mention, how much of an a-hole can you be to constantly disrespect your spouse and children's time like this?! He made you MISS school events in the past? Your poor kids!\n\nI would seriously consider if this is how you want the rest of your life to look...", "NTA for that however I'd like you to think about your kids and what type of upbringing you're putting them through by staying with a man who treats their mother like shit. The complexes and therapy time are racking up as we speak every day you stay.", "Wait what? Your husband text you & called you what now \u2026. And you\u2019re only upset because he is late to things? It appears you may have some bigger issues.\n\nWhy would you go anywhere with him? \n\nOf course you\u2019re NTA!!", "NTA...He's established a pattern of being unreliable, and you've adapted. He can either address his behaviour in a meaningful way, or be left behind. The name-calling is entirely unacceptable.", "What benefit does he bring to your relationship? Does he Support you emotionally? Does he help with your daily responsibilities or add to them? Would you be able to rely on him in an emergency?", "YTA for staying with this poor excuse for a human being.", "NTA, you\u2019re setting a healthy boundary. But him screaming at you and calling you names is abusive. Is he like this in other areas of your relationship?  Might be time to take a good hard look at it.", "The language he uses to describe and talk to you is unacceptable, regardless of being AH or NAH this time.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, the way he texted you is really, really upsetting. Is this a pattern? Does he lash out and call you names often? Because that's not OK. That's not how anyone should treat another human, particularly a partner that they are supposed to love and respect. \n\nI hope-- aside from assuring you that you are most definitely NTA in this situation-- that the reaction of this community makes you think long and hard about what you deserve and what you are actually getting out of this relationship. Sending you good luck and good vibes!", "NTA. Is he late for work? Or for things that he likes? If not then it's not time management, but he's showing how little he cares for you and your children. \n\nThis is sad. I think you are on the right path. He'll either buck up or leave.

I really don't understand how they are still employed.", "NTA, even a little bit. Husband is TA.", "NTA.  Actions, meet consequences.  You stick your ground and leave when you need to leave.

Time to either attend counseling or leave this abusive man.", "NTA.  \nI would bet that it's easier to get the kids off to school.

He should not have berrated you, and he should have been a grown up and woken up on time. On the other hand, you are not completely innocent either.

And what is watching all that play out in front of them teaching the kids about relationships?", "NTA. Your husband has consistently shown a lack of respect for your time and commitments. It's not fair for him to expect you to wait around for him when he can't manage his own schedule. You did the right thing by leaving on time and offering to save him a seat. Hopefully this will teach him a lesson about the importance of being punctual.", "No but you are TA for allowing a man to speak to you in such a manner! WTF", "NTA.

You need to think about this relationship and whether it\u2019s worth being berated every time he mismanages his time.", "Im really hoping the OOP replies with what positives this dude has. Because if he has a disorder that  makes time management harder, he has to get help with it and get more mental tools.

He\u2019s expecting you to treat him like another one of your children and that\u2019s ridiculous. I CANNOT STAND when others cause me to be late because of their time management failures. Your husband needs to grow up.", "YTA for keeping you children in this abusive hell. Sis LEAVE", "NTA. No explanation needed. However the verbal abuse does need to be addressed. That is a crazy way to speak to another human much less your spouse.", "Why are you with someone who doesn't contribute to the family, and verbally and emotionally abuses you? Dump this guy ASAP.", "NTA but why are you with someone who calls you vile names?  He has zero respect for you.", "NTA, and his communication about this is wildly disproportionate for him not getting up and ready to go.", "NTA, stop inviting him to the school events. If he wants to go, he'll make the arrangements. But you definitely need to discuss the verbal abuse and set a boundary to not tolerate that ever.", "NTA I\u2019d tell him you want to do marital counseling because he doesn\u2019t communicate or argue fairly, he goes for cruel insults. Also, you don\u2019t understand why you should miss important events because he doesn\u2019t find them worthwhile enough to show up at a reasonable time or why it\u2019s your responsibility to get him up and there. To denigrate you for wanting to be at your kids activities is also something to discuss with a counselor.", "NTA for leaving without him. However you will be YTA if you don\u2019t leave him permanently. If he speaks that way to you now, his abuse will only get worse over time and it\u2019s not long before your kids start hearing him speak like that, or worse, he speaks to them like that.

Ever.", "If you are well off, why do you only have one vehicle?\n\nWhy is a grown man this bad at time management?", "He does. He makes more money than me (we both do well but he earns ~30% more), he handles cooking and cleaning. He\u2019s a homebody and I\u2019m more social so I love going out to school events, sports, and make friends easily so we naturally fell into a rhythm of me handling most things outside the house and him inside the house.", "Right?  His chronic lateness pales in comparison to the continued verbal abuse.", "I do think about this. He\u2019s worse when I\u2019m not around and the thought of him having any solo time/custody kills me", "Thank you. My kiddo was so happy to see me when it was there and had a good seat to see the show", "So because he does the bare minimum it makes it okay for him to verbally abuse you? NTA for this instance but YWBTAH if you stay with him. Is this how you want your children to grow up and view adult relationships? Would you be okay with someone speaking to your children like this?", "What\u2019s his excuse for being verbally abusive towards you? If he says he\u2019s okay with you handling those things outside the home, he needs to let you do so WITHOUT attacking you over it.", "Good he makes 30% more.  He can use that money to pay you child support when you divorce this abusive ass.", "NTA for leaving him behind. If he was interested in going, he would have been a decent/responsible parent and been up when needed. It sounds to me like you have proof he is unreliable in certain aspects. He can't be trusted to get the kids anywhere in a time sensitive manner. What if they have a doctors appointment while they stay w him? It can be really hard to get one with certain specialties. Most reasonable judges would take things like this into consideration, and chances are low he'd get full/solo custody.", "Record it and put it in front of a judge. Get a lawyer."]}
