I am a woman and I have never discussed size with any of my female friends who are into guys. And we have had A LOT of girl talk conversations about guys but no one ever body shames.

The fact that she\u2019s calling you wrong for saying exactly what she said - and then getting other people in on what should be a conversation just between you both - makes me think that you\u2019re the only nice person in your marriage.

It\u2019s humiliating and cruel and I\u2019m very sorry she did that. Then the icing on the cake is that when you bring it up she somehow makes you the villain and invalidates your feelings?

You're married to a meangirl with some very weird double standards about bodyshaming (not to mention physically abusive, fucking yikes)", "NTA. Your wife was cruel and disrespectful to you, and then when you called her out, she was abusive to you rather than profusely apologizing which is what she should have done if she had a shred of decency or cared at all about you. Then she gossiped about you to her mom and sister which just shows she doesn't get it and doesn't care about your feelings. I find it very hard to believe that this is just an aberration. You deserve to have a partner that appreciates, cares for, and respects you. That is not your current wife, but it could be your next wife.", "NTA\n\nNot gonna say I've never discussed sex with my friends, but never have we ever discussed size.", "NTA.  She doesn't respect you.  I would suggest marriage counseling.  She said you're good to her, then she humiliates you, essentially, in public.  That's not a good look.  Apparently, she's not sexually attracted to you, and that's a heartbreaking thing to process for anyone.  I certainly would not want to be with someone who merely tolerated me.\nIt may be the perfect time to evaluate the relationship.  If there's a split.  Do.  Not.  Vacate.  Your.  Home.  She can go stay with her mother and talk about dicks.", "NTA but it sounds a little abusive and unhealthy.", "I'd dump her abusive ass.\nCan you imagine another 30-40  years of her bullshit?\nNTA", "NTA. Not ALL women do this, just AHs.", "This is not normal. It sounds like she not only doesn't respect you but she's abusive as well.  This is unforgivable. NTA", "NTA. Love how she manipulated you to think you did something wrong when she was the one badmouthing you to her friends. All you did was point out how she would feel if you talked about her in the same way.", "Wait, SHE body shamed you and laughed when her friends body shamed you, but then threw a fit and accused you of such when you brought up a HYPOTHETICAL scenario? Your wife is a (censored) hypocrite! NTA", "Yep she did DARVO on him- Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim (&) Offender.   This is an abuse tactic at worst, unhealthy response/ dynamic at best.", "OP's wife is Hypocrite and Narcissist. She literally turned everything on OP for just saying how she'd feel if he did the same thing. That's some next level shit. \n\nThe other thing that is bothering me is - \n\n> she would have left me a long time ago if I wasn\u2019t good to her.\n\nSo, she just settled for OP.", "I know I wouldn\u2019t want to be like someone like this. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault your average?\u201d is abusive. I would be done with this person and go find someone who appreciates me. And that\u2019s before she threw her drink at me because she\u2019s a hypocrite then went to her moms.", "I've definitely discussed sex things and body things with friends but I would never talk about my current partner cause he still has to interact with those people. Past boyfriends are fair game though. (Not that I body shame, just talking about private stuff)", "I\u2019m a woman and very open about sex. But I\u2019d never discuss specifics, even with my friends. It\u2019s more like saying \u201cyes I\u2019ve tried anal\u201d if asked or recommending a lube or fun position to a friend. Discussing and comparing size is a complete no, not even with a partner, there\u2019s just no point.", "Agreed. I\u2019ve never done this and never would. It\u2019s mean, childish behavior.", "I never understand the appeal to talk about uout significant other in such a way, like I'm not a prude but sex talk is between me and my partner not some bored girls who think it's really cool and funny to talk about penises.", "Calling it childish is an insult to children! It\u2019s just plain mean, and hypocrisy at its finest."]}
