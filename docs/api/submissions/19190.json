The fact that she\u2019s calling you wrong for saying exactly what she said - and then getting other people in on what should be a conversation just between you both - makes me think that you\u2019re the only nice person in your marriage.

It\u2019s humiliating and cruel and I\u2019m very sorry she did that. Then the icing on the cake is that when you bring it up she somehow makes you the villain and invalidates your feelings?
