There is even a recommendation by the shogi association for which pieces to take off the board as handicap depending on the difference in player level. Although taking both rook and bishop out might be a bit extreme handicap in chess, because in shogi, a pawn is promoted to a gold general (can move one square in all direction except diagonally backwards) once it enters opponent territory(three lines from the end) and any piece you capture can be returned to the board as your piece.

What about raising the Lombardi trophy, or winning the World Series and celebrating on the field?", "IMO if you are that precious in defeat maybe two player games are not for you.", "No, it isn't.  If he'd kept it up for hours after, that would be gloating.\n\nGo to a game store and watch people play games - you'll see real gloating.", "People are allowed to be happy, but saying 'Wow you suck' is still being an asshole, no matter how he words it. You can be a bad winner doing far less than acting like an ill-mannered three year old. Good sportsmanship never includes bragging to your opponent about how badly you beat them.", "Learn to read between the lines. In chess, bragging about beating someone faster than ever before is bragging about being much better than them. It's not winning the Lombardi Trophy, it's throwing s midfield celebration after beating the local community college 73-0.", "Thirty years of tournament chess play would say otherwise. It just happens that over that time, I learned manners and sportsmanship. Bragging to someone about how you just annihilated them, even if only done once per game, is being an asshole. It is absolutely possible to easily beat someone without insulting or mocking them afterwards.", "Yes, it is. It doesn't have to go on for an extended period to be gloating. Just because you see more of it at a game store doesn't make it somehow not gloating.", "He never said she sucked tho\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23you people on Reddit that just make things up to suit your narrative of these stories are hilarious. The kid was excited about having a new game record, he said one thing once, that doesn\u2019t make him a bad winner. I don\u2019t think you actually understand the meaning of good sportsmanship, sounds more your the sister in this situation that can\u2019t handle losing a game so you have to turn on the winner to make yourself feel better, if and if we re gonna spout off about good sportsmanship, then where is the sisters? Why does she get to act like a baby because she lost and that\u2019s okay but it isn\u2019t okay for the winner to be happy? You have no point here, the sister is only the AH because she tried to called him sexist for winning a game", "You lose a lot in life don't you", "Nah you\u2019re just an AH. And probably really fun during sporting competitions or at parties", "I am trying to wrap my head around you subjecting yourself to 30 years of serious competition when a single comment from a random online has upset you so much. Surely you lost some games over that time, and no doubt some of your opponents expressed joy at having beaten you, how did you endure the subsequent trauma?", "I mean, I posted the dictionary definition above and it requires \"dwelling\", not a single mention. It's fine that you apply the term more liberally, but it shouldn't be that surprising that others misunderstand when you do.", "Well, yeah, gloating by definition means dwelling on something and not letting go.\n\nYou have an incredibly low bar for what counts as gloating, dude.", "Yeah this person is making things up in their head. OP said let\u2019s go, a win in 15 moves that\u2019s a new record for me. And then never brought it up again. Never once did he say you suck", "Yeah, that comment of his is actually telling her she sucks. That's what you're doing when you brag about beating someone quickly in chess. English has this neat thing where you can imply things without outright stating them. You should look into it sometime.\n\nAnd no, I'm coming at this from a position of having played in chess tournaments for thirty years and having seen folks act like this before. It's strongly frowned upon because it's terrible sportsmanship.", "Ahh, yes, I'm an asshole because I believe in being civil to my opponent. What wonderful logic.", "Who said it upset me?\n\nI said it was bragging and poor sportsmanship. And I've continued to discuss it with people who disagree with me.  Where, from that, do you get that I'm upset at all, much less 'so much'? Am I not allowed to defend my opinion?", "What age do you think OP is? 50? He\u2019s a 15 year old kid that meant nothing but he best his own record, the only way it can come across as she sucks, is if she takes it that way. You can\u2019t twist someone\u2019s words to fit this narrative in your head to make yourself feel better, if she thinks that\u2019s what he\u2019s saying then it\u2019s because she thinks she sucks", "If he was excited about winning in x moves, it sounds like he is happy to win so efficiently. Come on, you claim to have played tournament chess for 30 years, surely you understand how developing your game is a battle against yourself. \n\nBeing able to win in fewer moves is a sign that you are starting to develop coherent strategies, which is a huge move forward for a serious player. Something that anyone would get excited about. Not sure why you are pretending not to know that...", "No you\u2019re crying about OP being happy he set a new personal record. Everyone on here replying to you is clowning you for having this opinion. You can be excited you set a personal record and vocalizing that once. That is not gloating. Also this isn\u2019t a chess competition. It\u2019s a brother sister game. If she gets this offended by losing and uses the sexist word incorrectly maybe she should stop playing chess or play someone edle", "Oh yeah, I 100% support you backing you opinion btw. This would be a boring place if we all agreed all the time.", "You just seem very invested in claiming this behavior was egregious, when no doubt you were subjected to a lot of opponents who were even more joyous in victory. Doesn't sound like much fun at all given you personal standards of sportsmanship."]}
