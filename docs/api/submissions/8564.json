I told her that she needs to stop being a sore loser because she always is mean to me for the rest of the day when she loses.

You're not beating her *because* she's a girl; you're beating her because she's an unskilled player who happens to be a girl. It's sexist if you let her win just because she's a girl playing chess and you go easy on her. \n\nAlso, as close siblings, you both build the self-confidence of each other and you both also dent it. Sibling's prerogative,  best friend and worst enemy rolled into one. \n\nShe needs to learn how to lose with grace, a skill she'll need for life, because no one can win everything and no one likes a loser who screams victim of x, y, or z reason each time", "NTA.\n\nYou were excited,  that's a very normal response but you certainly were not being sexist.", "NTA, you beat her, she lost.. it\u2019s literally a game. It shouldn\u2019t affect her self esteem, and doesn\u2019t make you sexist. If losing a game of fucking chess bothers her, she probably has other things to work through. Plus, as the older sibling she should set a proper example for you. You were just excited you won, you didn\u2019t \u201crub it in her face.\u201d. I\u2019d probably stop playing with her and find someone else to play with.

She is a bigger ah because she tried to say you were sexist. Intentionally losing or saying girls are bad at chess is sexist. Two roads jd suggest 1. Don't play her until she wants real match (ask). 2.  ask if she wants pointers when you play to help her get better. Meaning you are not in the same league right now. So, be more of a teacher, but ask her if that's what she wants. Those are kinda the options left \ud83d\ude02 like, I'm not going to school my 4 year old soccer. I'm going to teach him. She is new to the game, so maybe she just needs some support?", "ESH. Being new at Chess and playing against someone seasoned is so damn frustrating.

Besides it\u2019s good learning to deal with gloating when you\u2019re younger otherwise you grow up and embarrass yourself by not having a basic understanding of how to cope with it. Honestly it\u2019s kinda sad she hasn\u2019t learned by now. Forget \u201cletting her win\u201d or \u201c be a better winner \u201c don\u2019t play with her anymore so she learns what being a sore loser gets her and you don\u2019t have to deal with it", "NTA\n\nSexist would be saying you won *because* she is a girl....and her acting as if being a girl means she can't handle losing a game.", "NTA.  It might be sexist to let her win but not to win yourself.", "NTA. It would be sexist to let her win. That implies that you don't think she could beat you fair and square. Letting her take her lumps is in no way sexist.

The irony is that she made it sexist herself, not you, by implying \"Yeah, I'm a girl and you're a guy that's why your beating me.\" Or asking for a gender based hand out.   \n\n\nAs for the gloating thing? Meh fuck that, too. 15 Moves ain't bad.", "NTA, she is just a sore loser, and it was never about gender. She makes excuses for losing at somthing, it sucks to lose, but you don\u2019t blame it on others and accuse them of false things.", "NTA about being called a sexist.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think you are not actually letting her grow her game, and enjoying a record win against a less skilled opponent like that sounds cruel. She isn\u2019t an AI.\n\nIn shogi (a Japanese version of chess), the better player going against a novice or less skilled player usually plays with a handicap, usually starting with the pieces corresponding to the rook and bishop off the board against a novice. There is even a recommendation by the shogi association for which pieces to take off the board as handicap depending on the difference in player level. Although taking both rook and bishop out might be a bit extreme handicap in chess, because in shogi, a pawn is promoted to a gold general (can move one square in all direction except diagonally backwards) once it enters opponent territory(three lines from the end) and any piece you capture can be returned to the board as your piece. And also, shogi is played on a 9 by 9 board with 20 pieces per player, so the importance of a single piece may be diluted.", "This was actually an SNL skit many many years ago.

I beat him, and I always assumed it was because he was tired (it was during a booty call). He's been playing since he was a kid and I only know the rules so I was over the moon when I beat him. I brought it up every now and then too, especially because it's the only time I've beaten him at chess. A year ago he told me he let me win to not derail the night and I was shocked. Floored. I have no idea why, but the thought that he let me win never entered my head. I mean, he was getting into my pants no matter how the game turned out."]}
