In which case, I think that therapy and healing are in order for not just your dad, but all of you as a family unit.\n\nYour dad could then better understand what your childhood was like.

The OP might never have a chance to tell her the full truth in time and it might be something that the OP then has to manage.  So imagine the OP not telling the girlfriend the full truth and hearing that they are getting married or that the girlfriend is pregnant.

You answered her question to the best of your ability and did so honestly.  \n\n\nYour dad isn't happy that she now knows about his past. The issue is that he's blaming you. He's the only one to blame for his choices and his actions. He knows he's done wrong because he tried hiding it from his girlfriend. He hasn't done anything to try to make up for his past, and he seems to think that he can wear a mask and pretend to be who he wants when it pleases him. Your dad is a narcissist, a manipulator and a gaslighter. This is exactly why he did this volunteer work. He made your mother doubt her own sanity. He made her doubt that he is a bad person. He doesn't seem to have changed, and he is hiding his true colours from his girlfriend.  Does she have minor children?  She definitely needs to know that they are in danger around him. If he assaulted your sister, his own flesh and blood, he will not hesitate to do it again given the chance. With all of that said, it's clear why he hasn't told his girlfriend about his past.  If he had changed, the proof would be in the pudding: he would have told his girlfriend about his past and about the help he's received to change even before they got into a relationship because she has the right to know all of this.  \n\n\nI'm sorry for the trauma that this man put your entire family through. You did nothing wrong other than give a narcissist a reality check that he didn't enjoy.", "NTA. He might look nice right now to his GF, but sooner or later he'll be like with his GF like how he was with your mom.\n\nIt's better for the GF to know it right now.

So when my sister said she\u2019s leaving him because he\u2019s abusive it was a huge shock to all. \n\nI personally think you did this girl a favour. He\u2019s obviously hasn\u2019t shown her that side of him yet and is more interested in keeping that good guy image than actually trying to understand why is daughter doesn\u2019t want a relationship with him.", "NTA Firstly I fully believe a woman should ask the ex wife and the man's children what sort of a husband and father he is. I think it is extremely important. I also think it is important to hear their honest thoughts before it is too late.  I only know one woman who asked the ex about the man she was about to marry. She was told by the ex that he drank and would beat her. She decided to go ahead with the marriage because he had been sober for a few years and had never touched her. By the time her eldest was 7 he had started drinking again and beating her. They divorced. I thought she was crazy to trust him, as people do not change.  Secondly I believe if someone asks a question you should answer as honestly as possible or not at all. No lies. If she married him and he behaved just as badly to her and any future kids she would be bitter you lied and you would feel guilty for lying. How could you live with yourself if you hadn't been honest.", "Eh. You\u2019re entitled to live your life based on what your experiences are. And when someone asks you have the option to share. You did. NTA.", "> I'm one-sided.\n\nI mean yeah. **Your** side. Whose side did he *think* you'd be on?", "It's not like you went behind his back & trashed him.  She invited you & asked for the truth.  You gave it to her.  You probably did her a favor since abusers will romance you until they've got you under their thumb, then the real person emerges.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your job to cover up his abusive past, and you were asked directly and privately by someone who has a vested interest in knowing the truth. I think you acted with integrity and grace. She can do with that information what she will, her choice is not on you. But now she knows.", "NTA if he was so concerned with what his SO thought of him he wouldn\u2019t have abused all of you and your mom all those years. You don\u2019t get to paint yourself like a saint just because you have a new SO.", "It was one sided. Now your father can give his side. Either way, his girlfriend now knows how you feel and at the very least can stop feeling guilty at your distance. what else she chooses to do with he information you gave is completely up to her. NTA", "In my Opinion:\n\n\nNTA. GF seems smart to investigate why an adult child of her bf went low contact and not just take the bf\u2019s reasoning. Also GF seems to care about him and her a lot to try to repair said relationship just in case it was her. \n\nThis GF really seems like a keeper. Hopefully the father doesn\u2019t fuck it up like he did with his first marriage and kids.", "NTA", "NTA. She sensed that something is wrong with her relationship with your father. She asked you a straight question. You gave her a straight answer. You didn\u2019t try to make him look bad. He was able to do that without anyone else\u2019s assistance.", "NTA.

Don't let em lol.", "NTA. Give your dads girlfriend credit for recognizing she was only getting one side to the story. Being honest is not being an asshole. Your dad doesn\u2019t like the truth and now feels threatened that his relationship is in jeopardy. Too bad!!", "NTA. She asked you told.

She\u2019s probably grateful.\n\nAnd who cares what your dad thinks. He made himself look bad by being a crappy father.", "NTA, there is usually two sides of the story. According to you, she did ask for a reason, well, you gave her a reason, your father looked bad, yes but you didn't lie, you could have said probably a lot of other things, but this was your trigger, so you didn't lie, again...", "NTA\n\nAt the very least it wasn't fair to the girlfriend that she thought that she was the cause of why OP was distant.", "NTA your dad sounds like a narcissist. You did the right thing. She would've found out the hard way eventually when he gets comfortable enough with her... enough to start treating her like he did your mom.... I think you saved her honestly.", "NTA she asked, and you had every right to tell her your story.", "NTA.  You can tell your father that you will not lie for him, point out that you are not the one who was looking for information and his reaction proves exactly why you want no contact with him.  As for your sister, we\u2019ll clearly she is his enabler and in need of healing.  Be patient with her because it looks like she\u2019s still getting over the trauma.", "NTA! Everyone should warn people about abusers. \n\nIf you choose to hide an abuser\u2019s past, you\u2019re placing the new partner in danger. And for what?", "NTA.   \nIt can be very freeing to just cut toxic people out of one\u2019s life. Do not be guilted because faaaaaaaaammmmiiiiillyyyyyyy.   \nfuck that noise!", "NTA\n\nShe asked why you don't have contact with him, you told her the truth. I am against us trying to make people sound good, even in death, when they were not good. Abusers are often very kind outside the home. Just because your younger sister is in denial doesn't mean you have to be.\n\nYou have valid and legitimate reason for choosing to have minimal contact with him, that is your right.", "NTA. His girlfriend sounds like a gem. She reached out to you and was obviously personable enough for you to speak your truth. I doubt she sticks around for long. If I were her the only acceptable response from your dad would have been \u201cI am not proud of my shortcomings and continue to work on improving myself. Would you help me rebuild a relationship with my daughter?\u201d Any attempt to put the full blame on his daughter should be an immediate dealbreaker.\n\nHaving said that people can and do change. Barring fear of violence always keep the door ajar for your father to show he has changed and wants to reconnect. If his girlfriend sticks around keeping a (distant) relationship with her would satisfy as keeping a line of communication open.", "NTA\nYou stayed away and kept quiet until the GF contacted you and asked specifically what was up with you and your dad. He's still trying to manipulate you and is no doubt doing the same with the GF. Good luck.", "NTA.  She asked for your truth and you told it.  If your Dad doesn't like it, it doesn't mean he can change it. You might have made his GF think hard about a serious decision related to him. He may have changed, but if he has, he should be prepared to prove it.", "NTA if he didn't want it talked about he shouldn't have done it.", "I read something the other day that stuck with me - if you don't want people to talk shit about your behaviour, don't act shitty.\n\nOne for dad to think about. NTA", "NTA the truth will out.\n\nHe has probably blamed his girlfriend for you not seeing them.\n\nShe deserves the truth.", "No", "If that\u2019s the case, sounds like he hasn\u2019t changed at all. Hopefully GF sees the red flags and saves herself.", "This was my first thought.", "She seems like a decent person too - thought she had in some way jeopardised her boyfriend's relationship with his daughter and went about actively trying to clear the air so she wouldn't come between them. Of course she's going to want to know the truth if she goes in to set things right only to find out its not what it seemed.", "I kinda hope the new girlfriend keeps up with OP regularly.", "What the fuck is this nonsense", "'He can have a little abuse, as a treat!!'\n\nOP you're NTA, your side of the story is yours, yes, but you didn't lie and honestly, I hope it helps your father's girlfriend see through his manipulation. You didn't do anything wrong, not one bit, in fact you probably helped someone. <3", "100% this. GF is now spooked and rightly so.", "RIGHT?!?!?!", "Either that or I'm guessing he's let some abusive tenancies slip, even subtlety and the gf has picked up on in and wanted to gain clarification of if this is who he truly is.\n\nOr possibly a mix of both."]}
