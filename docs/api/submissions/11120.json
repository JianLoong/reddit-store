I'm guessing your dad led her to believe it was her fault why y'all didn't go around. So I don't blame her for being concerned and asking for the truth. Which you gave her.

Granted, there's always 2 sides to every marriage, but he's not accepting or owning up to his side.", "> She asked me why I'm so distant from dad \n\nNTA - she asked for your side and you gave it.\n\n> and I'm one-sided.\n\nYup, but you aren't obligated to be some impartial reporter.

In which case, I think that therapy and healing are in order for not just your dad, but all of you as a family unit.\n\nYour dad could then better understand what your childhood was like.

The girlfriend isn't some outsider, its his girlfriend.\n\n2. The problem of being \"measured\" is that then you can be accused of hiding the truth/lying.  \n\n3. The OP might never have a chance to tell her the full truth in time and it might be something that the OP then has to manage.

Then the OP has a huge obligation and in some situations might be the A.  \n\n> Next time just say \u201cmaybe you should ask him\u201d\n\nThe girlfriend explicitly asked her.

I hope she sees through it."]}
