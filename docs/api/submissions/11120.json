You answered her question to the best of your ability and did so honestly.  \n\n\nYour dad isn't happy that she now knows about his past. The issue is that he's blaming you. He's the only one to blame for his choices and his actions. He knows he's done wrong because he tried hiding it from his girlfriend. He hasn't done anything to try to make up for his past, and he seems to think that he can wear a mask and pretend to be who he wants when it pleases him. Your dad is a narcissist, a manipulator and a gaslighter. This is exactly why he did this volunteer work. He made your mother doubt her own sanity. He made her doubt that he is a bad person. He doesn't seem to have changed, and he is hiding his true colours from his girlfriend.  Does she have minor children?  She definitely needs to know that they are in danger around him. If he assaulted your sister, his own flesh and blood, he will not hesitate to do it again given the chance. With all of that said, it's clear why he hasn't told his girlfriend about his past.  If he had changed, the proof would be in the pudding: he would have told his girlfriend about his past and about the help he's received to change even before they got into a relationship because she has the right to know all of this.  \n\n\nI'm sorry for the trauma that this man put your entire family through. You did nothing wrong other than give a narcissist a reality check that he didn't enjoy.", "NTA.

I think it is extremely important. I also think it is important to hear their honest thoughts before it is too late.  I only know one woman who asked the ex about the man she was about to marry. She was told by the ex that he drank and would beat her. She decided to go ahead with the marriage because he had been sober for a few years and had never touched her. By the time her eldest was 7 he had started drinking again and beating her. They divorced. I thought she was crazy to trust him, as people do not change.  Secondly I believe if someone asks a question you should answer as honestly as possible or not at all. No lies. If she married him and he behaved just as badly to her and any future kids she would be bitter you lied and you would feel guilty for lying.

It\u2019s not your job to cover up his abusive past, and you were asked directly and privately by someone who has a vested interest in knowing the truth. I think you acted with integrity and grace.

His girlfriend sounds like a gem. She reached out to you and was obviously personable enough for you to speak your truth. I doubt she sticks around for long.

Would you help me rebuild a relationship with my daughter?\u201d Any attempt to put the full blame on his daughter should be an immediate dealbreaker.\n\nHaving said that people can and do change.

He's still trying to manipulate you and is no doubt doing the same with the GF. Good luck.", "NTA.  She asked for your truth and you told it.

He's clearly not changed, as he encouraged them to keep lying about the fact they were abused. It's a huge red flag that he's dishonest with his new partner about his past.

Abusers famously wait until they believe you are trapped in order to abuse them, e.g. via marriage, children, etc. Furthermore, OP already decided to cut contact with their abuser. That's extremely valid and pressuring them to seek therapy to \"heal\" their family is wrong. He never acted like a good dad, and if he wanted a loving family he should have acted like one.

In this case though I think he is keeping it under wraps because my friend notices him holding back saying things he would normally say to her when her dad\u2019s wife is present. Things he didn\u2019t hold back when he was with her mother. \n\nSo she knows it\u2019s in there. He\u2019s just concerned that his wife isn\u2019t attached enough to him so she will leave him. Idk maybe the fact that she left an abuser before means he can\u2019t ever do that to her without her hightailing it out of there. So maybe he\u2019s the one now stuck. \n\nBut particularly as it applies to my friend. He no longer speaks openly about how I am Jewish (he used to constantly tell her how it was unfortunate she was friends with me because (insert X stereotype)) and he used to make comments about her ex boyfriend of five years. His family was mexican and he a first generation American. When he started dating his new wife he began saying less about my friend and her boyfriends relationship. \n\nI do see him as hiding the ball here. \n\nBut you\u2019re right. Just because someone has been abusive in the past doesn\u2019t mean they will in the future.", "That\u2019s too bad for your friend that he\u2019s just hiding.
