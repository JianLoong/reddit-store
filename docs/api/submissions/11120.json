You answered her question to the best of your ability and did so honestly.  \n\n\nYour dad isn't happy that she now knows about his past. The issue is that he's blaming you. He's the only one to blame for his choices and his actions. He knows he's done wrong because he tried hiding it from his girlfriend. He hasn't done anything to try to make up for his past, and he seems to think that he can wear a mask and pretend to be who he wants when it pleases him. Your dad is a narcissist, a manipulator and a gaslighter. This is exactly why he did this volunteer work. He made your mother doubt her own sanity. He made her doubt that he is a bad person. He doesn't seem to have changed, and he is hiding his true colours from his girlfriend.  Does she have minor children?  She definitely needs to know that they are in danger around him. If he assaulted your sister, his own flesh and blood, he will not hesitate to do it again given the chance. With all of that said, it's clear why he hasn't told his girlfriend about his past.  If he had changed, the proof would be in the pudding: he would have told his girlfriend about his past and about the help he's received to change even before they got into a relationship because she has the right to know all of this.  \n\n\nI'm sorry for the trauma that this man put your entire family through.

I think it is extremely important. I also think it is important to hear their honest thoughts before it is too late.  I only know one woman who asked the ex about the man she was about to marry. She was told by the ex that he drank and would beat her. She decided to go ahead with the marriage because he had been sober for a few years and had never touched her. By the time her eldest was 7 he had started drinking again and beating her. They divorced. I thought she was crazy to trust him, as people do not change.  Secondly I believe if someone asks a question you should answer as honestly as possible or not at all. No lies. If she married him and he behaved just as badly to her and any future kids she would be bitter you lied and you would feel guilty for lying.

It\u2019s not your job to cover up his abusive past, and you were asked directly and privately by someone who has a vested interest in knowing the truth. I think you acted with integrity and grace.

His girlfriend sounds like a gem. She reached out to you and was obviously personable enough for you to speak your truth. I doubt she sticks around for long.

He's still trying to manipulate you and is no doubt doing the same with the GF. Good luck.", "NTA.  She asked for your truth and you told it.

You're just mad I didn't hide it for you\".", "NTA. But you know what they say about how opinions are like AHs, everybody has one? Yeah. Never mind your sister.", "NTA\n\nYou just told her the truth because she asked you, I hope she uses that info to get out of that relationship before he gaslight her enough to make her stay\n\nAlso, I would go NC with your dad cause that \"you made me look bad\" attitude just shows how he don't realize or don't care at all that he was abusive towards you, your sisters and mum", "NTA  \n\n\n\"...she asked for the truth...\"  \n\n\nThis, exactly. Your dad's girlfriend has experienced the tension, and I think she was an upright (and brave) person to ask instead of making assumptions. She asked, and you responded in kind. A few decades back, my divorced uncle started a relationship with a lovely woman, a widow. Early on she didn't see the side of him that was bullying and abusive. That didn't start until quite late in their years. I am very grateful that she had several adult children who lived nearby and kept their collective eye on the situation. I only saw them a few times a year, so didn't notice it until the last couple. She herself had fairly good boundaries as well. So in the end, he was told to leave. She remains a lovely person, and I am still in touch.", "NTA it was abuse. It\u2019s one-sided? \ud83e\udd28What\u2019s his excuse for it going to be since apparently gf only heard one side? There was no excuse for it. She should also know what he may really be like. If she likes him and he treats her differently than he did your mom then great. But given his history she should know to proceed with caution.", "Everyone deserves the truth and that\u2019s what you did, sugar coating and being pretend nice has done no one any favours.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She asked for your opinion and you gave it. Your father is TA for expecting you to lie to cover for his misdeeds.", "Of course you\u2019re one-sided. You\u2019re one side and he\u2019s the other. The real one-sided scenario was when she was only hearing his side, now she has both. He\u2019s mad that it\u2019s *not* one-sided anymore.\n\nNTA, dude sounds manipulative, reminds me a bit of my own unfortunately. My rule of thumb is never be hateful, but never lie either. Just walk through life being totally honest about your feelings and how his actions have affected you, but without being a shit-stirrer, or spiteful. Sounds like you nailed that balance.", "NTA. If he feels his actions and behavior was defensible he should go ahead and try to defend himself. \nIf his new GF deems them indefensible then that\u2019s that. Maybe he\u2019s grown into a better person and learned his lesson after mistreating his first wife and children horribly, and if that\u2019s the case he needs to be honest and prove his progress (therapy? Anger management?)\n\nI\u2019m hoping that\u2019s the case for your dad, although it\u2019s terrible that you, your siblings, and your mother paid the price while he tries to sweep the damage under the rug.", "NTA.\n\nHis girlfriend asked for the truth, and that's what you gave her. He can't be mad cause someone wanted to know why his own daughter was distant from him. Maybe, the little sister might not remember all the things that happened during her childhood but in the end. All someone can ask for is the truth, whether they want to believe it or not.", "NTA you just told the truth and possibly saved that woman from making your mothers mistake", "Info: what was the situation that made your mom leave?

GF asked you answered no malice", "You aren\u2019t obligated to protect your father\u2019s reputation. She sought you out. She asked. You were honest. You don\u2019t need to feel bad about that.", "I don't need this to make a judgement, so NTA.  But was the situation with your sister one of cruelty, safety concern, or something else?  Without divulging details if you don't want.", "NTA, stay strong!", "NTA", "You didn't make him look bad. He did that all by himself, and didn't need any help at all.  If anything, what you did was give her a warning about what your father is like, so she didn't need to find out, years later, like your mother did. Hopefully she takes advantage of that warning to break up with him, and spare herself a lot of pain and aggravation. You did good. NTA", "NTA gf deserves the truth AND to know that it isn't anything SHE did.", "NTA, good to know that your father hasn\u2019t changed a bit.", "NTA She asked, you had every right to tell the truth.", "NTA. You shared your truth, and you're never an asshole for doing that. Interjecting your truth, maybe, but she *asked*. Now it's up to her what to do with that info.", ">my younger sister thinks I shouldn't have told her all of that and just let them be\n\nYou were \"letting them be\". The GF reached out to you.  You've done nothing wrong by telling her why you are LC with your dad.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou didn't \"try\" to make him look bad. You told the truth, as she deserved to know. If the truth is what \"makes him look bad\", then that's his fault AND his problem.", "NTA. You can\u2019t ruin someone\u2019s life by making it more accurate", "NTA.\n\nYour father thinking you \u201ctried to make him look bad\u201d shows he has no self awareness, accountability and is continuing to manipulate situations rather than believe he should make efforts to change.\n\nShe seems like a genuinely caring person in the fact she believed SHE was the issue, which is probably due in part to your father letting her believe this about herself.  He\u2019s just upset you didn\u2019t go out of your way to lie for him.", "If telling the truth makes someone look bad, the fault lies not with the teller or the truth. NTA", ">  ...and I'm one-sided\n\nyour point of view is the only one you have.  I think it's important to remember that you are entitled to your own life story, and you're not obligated to edit it for the convenience of other people.\n\nYou didn't seek out this woman to spread gossip, she asked you, you responded truthfully about your parent/child relationship.  \n\nNTA", "NTA how can you let the situation be as your sister says when the gf called you and pulled you into it? I hope she runs far and fast but if not I hope it opens her eyes to what type of hypocrite she\u2019s involved with.", "She contacted you, he'd let her think she was the problem, you told her the truth. You didn't set out to cause problems, and did nothing wrong by telling the truth.\n\nYou don't have to cover for him.", "NTA. She asked a direct question and deserves a truthful answer.  Hopefully you gave her something to think about regarding where their relationship should go.", "NTA. You did not lie, the gf asked you the reason  and you told her the truth. Its that simple.

They say this one sided thing to trivialize that and down play the importance of your emotions and suffering in order to maintain his ego. You are not one sided. Your suffering and life was fucked over by him and he doesnt deserve a chance to do it again in the now - unless its on your terms. She sounds like she was hoping to grow and have a family with yall - not babies but holidays and casual stuff and to grow together. But dad burnt that bridge not you hold unfounded resentment. You maintain your boundaries girl.", "Oh yes, there are, I had to become almost 30 to realise, my parents marriage was a shit show because of both of them and not just my dad, doesn't change the fact, that he was my primary abuser. There aren't two sides to being an abusive parent.", "I probably would have started the conversation with what his GF knew about OP and the whole situation first before divulging her thoughts and info from her side.", "If she took the time to have lunch with her and ask her the hard questions and listen to them, she is MORE than decent.  She genuinely cares about it.  It can\u2019t be easy to come into that situation.  And sounds like dad is trying to honeymoon her as others have said.  I hope this new girlfriend realizes this and decides if this is the type of person she wants to be around.  It sounds like it was eye opening.", "It's fine to not agree, but do not invalidate my thoughts.", ">He can have a little abuse, as a treat!!\n\nOh, go on then, just a little. You want verbal, physical, emotional, or this subs favorite ... financial?\n\nBut then he pulls out the first weapon in the how to guide on denying there was ever any \"abuse\".\n\n>he said he's upset I tried to make him look bad.\n\nWell yeh mate. If truth makes you look bad, then I have some more bad news for you.", "I agree, she's spooked.  Hopefully the next angry call from \"Dad\" will be that it's all OP's fault his girlfriend left him.  If she's smart, she'll break it off with him.", "Alright, I will address your thoughts.\n1. Of course he considers it spreading lies, because he's an abusive narcissist. He can do no wrong, and he wants the gf to believe he's perfect. OP and their siblings were abused. That's the truth, which he wants to keep under wraps. Him wanting to keep it a secret shows that he doesn't want to change. \n2. OP is an abuse victim. It is very common for abuse victims to wrongly feel guilty. We want our parents to love us and we want things to be okay, plus dad is a gaslighter. OP has lived their whole life being discouraged from rocking the boat. Of course they feel bad for telling the truth, that is what the abuser wants.\n3. Dad already understands what their childhood was like. He was there, he is the parent. He knows exactly what he did, but he'll twist it any way he can so that he seems innocent. Narcissistic abusers never want to look guilty in public.\n4. Why would OP want to do that? He's clearly not changed, as he encouraged them to keep lying about the fact they were abused. It's a huge red flag that he's dishonest with his new partner about his past. OP is giving her a chance to leave before she is locked into marriage and abused herself. Abusers famously wait until they believe you are trapped in order to abuse them, e.g. via marriage, children, etc. Furthermore, OP already decided to cut contact with their abuser. That's extremely valid and pressuring them to seek therapy to \"heal\" their family is wrong. He never acted like a good dad, and if he wanted a loving family he should have acted like one. He already made that choice over and over again. OP's final decision should be respected. No one should ever be encouraged to let an abuser back into their life.\n\nOP NTA.", "I'll stop invalidating your thoughts when your thoughts invalidating child abuse.", "I remember a similar post a while back, and the GF had seen a few flags on her own and ended up breaking off the relationship after talking with the kids.  The history with the family just confirmed her suspicions.", "Abusive tendencies like leading his gf to believe that it's her fault that his kids don't come around?", "That person is trying to claim cishet is a slur in another thread. I wouldn't engage them.", "Um, where exactly is the disagreement then? \n\nDid you even read my post?", "I'm not up for tearing down your paper tiger. I think you misunderstood what I was trying to convey, but nothing justifies your disrespect. Have a good day.", "Well yes there's that, but what else has he got his gf beliving is her fault? How does he even speak to her when the doors are closed?\n\nThe dude is clearly mentally abusive so it's not a push to believe that he's also verbally abusive as well. Even though the gf has asked OP about this one thing, it wouldn't be surprising if other abusive tendencies are starting to show through.", "did you read theirs? They just gave you a pretty elaborate explanation of it. and i have to agree with it. \n\nTherapy is not a fix-it for everything, and some people should be kept at a distance.", "I'm not suggesting or advocating that OP seek therapy to rekindle a relationship with dad! \n\nShe clearly cares what he thinks, else we wouldn't be here. And her sisters are in touch to keep the peace, as she states in a comment.\n\nHer dad has accused her of lying and it's stinging her clearly. Also I'm not so sure that he has introspected enough to know he's done anything wrong. Do-gooders often ignore how they wrong their own loved ones. Take Gandhi for example.\n\nI'm suggesting they all seek therapy - as there are unresolved emotions there that I can personally see as red flags form OP's post.\n\nEnd of discussion at my end. I respect your views, but I do not respect the first commentator calling mine nonsense. That's disrespectful and unhelpful."]}
