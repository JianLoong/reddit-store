I'm guessing your dad led her to believe it was her fault why y'all didn't go around. So I don't blame her for being concerned and asking for the truth. Which you gave her. When she confronted your dad, he again wants to spread the fault instead of accepting it. Granted, there's always 2 sides to every marriage, but he's not accepting or owning up to his side.", "> She asked me why I'm so distant from dad \n\nNTA - she asked for your side and you gave it.\n\n> and I'm one-sided.\n\nYup, but you aren't obligated to be some impartial reporter.  And everyone should know this.\n\nFor my interest - what is your other's sisters relationship with your dad like?", "NTA\n\nIf people don't want their shitty behaviour made public, they need to not do shitty things.\n\nAlso you did her a solid favour there.\n\nNot what you asked, but you need somehow to not *care* what some abusive old man thinks.", "NTA she asked if she was the reason you said no she asked for the reason and you gave it to her. Your dad should\u2019ve accepted it and told her \u201cI was a different person then I try not to be that way anymore\u201d or something along those lines and admitted it was true instead of getting mad at you for telling his girlfriend how he used to be and why y\u2019all have limited contact.", "NTA \n\nIt's a tough position to be in, but your dad's GF deserves the truth after the effort she made to reach out. \n\nI can, however, understand why your dad is pissed. To him, it seems like you're spreading lies. \n\nSince you're on Reddit wondering whether you were an AH to your dad, it seems to me you still care what he thinks. In which case, I think that therapy and healing are in order for not just your dad, but all of you as a family unit.\n\nYour dad could then better understand what your childhood was like. And can work on his issues and be a better partner to his current GF. You could then consider a relationship with him.", "He was obviously not going to tell her the truth even if she asked and it\u2019s something she should know as well so I\u2019d say a definite NTA", ">  this kind of thing ALWAYS hits different coming from an \u201coutsider\u201d so to speak.\n\n1. The girlfriend isn't some outsider, its his girlfriend.\n\n2. The problem of being \"measured\" is that then you can be accused of hiding the truth/lying.  \n\n3. The OP might never have a chance to tell her the full truth in time and it might be something that the OP then has to manage.  So imagine the OP not telling the girlfriend the full truth and hearing that they are getting married or that the girlfriend is pregnant.  Then the OP has a huge obligation and in some situations might be the A.  \n\n> Next time just say \u201cmaybe you should ask him\u201d\n\nThe girlfriend explicitly asked her.  The OP is suppose to say \"Ask my dad how I feel.\"?!?!", "Two sides to a marriage, sure, but he also abused his kids. Dudes just abusive and doesn't want the new girl to know yet cuz he's still trying to honeymoon her.", "My younger sisters feel the same way as me, but they're just not so vocal about it if that makes sense? Like they'll go along with what he says for the sake of keeping the peace", "Pretty much what I said", "Yep, he is probably love bombing her and trying to spin a narrative about his past. I hope she sees through it.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou didn't seek out his girlfriend, to begin with. She invited you to talk with her, and she asked why you're distant. You answered her question to the best of your ability and did so honestly.  \n\n\nYour dad isn't happy that she now knows about his past. The issue is that he's blaming you. He's the only one to blame for his choices and his actions. He knows he's done wrong because he tried hiding it from his girlfriend. He hasn't done anything to try to make up for his past, and he seems to think that he can wear a mask and pretend to be who he wants when it pleases him. Your dad is a narcissist, a manipulator and a gaslighter. This is exactly why he did this volunteer work. He made your mother doubt her own sanity. He made her doubt that he is a bad person. He doesn't seem to have changed, and he is hiding his true colours from his girlfriend.  Does she have minor children?  She definitely needs to know that they are in danger around him. If he assaulted your sister, his own flesh and blood, he will not hesitate to do it again given the chance. With all of that said, it's clear why he hasn't told his girlfriend about his past.  If he had changed, the proof would be in the pudding: he would have told his girlfriend about his past and about the help he's received to change even before they got into a relationship because she has the right to know all of this.  \n\n\nI'm sorry for the trauma that this man put your entire family through. You did nothing wrong other than give a narcissist a reality check that he didn't enjoy.", "NTA. He might look nice right now to his GF, but sooner or later he'll be like with his GF like how he was with your mom.\n\nIt's better for the GF to know it right now. He still have a chance to change if he wants, but what he did before are the truth that happened to you and your family.", "NTA \n\nYou told her the truth.\nIt is also good for her: she won't be stressed thinking she caused some sort of rift in a family AND you warned her.\nIf your father would be (or is) abusive towards her, she maybe leaves him sooner now, because she knows he isn't some misunderstood angelic being lol", "NTA.\n\nShe asked, you answered.\n\nKudos to her for inviting you to coffee and encouraging openness.

I'm glad you could be open and honest and maybe it will be for the best. NTA!", "NTA. The truth is always easiest.", "NTA. She asked, you answered.", "NTA.  Dad was probably crying to his GF about his neglectful daughters who never visit with dear old dad, after all he's done for them, and what a helluva guy her is ,etc.  Nothing wrong with setting her straight.  You did her a favor.", "NTA\n\nYour dad is embarrassed because his behavior made him look like the AH that he is.", "NTA    \nDon't ask questions you really don't want the answer to.  You told her your truth and how they deal with it as a couple is their issue, not yours.", "Lol NTA", "NTA. You were honest. You don't have to associate with your father but you were also kind in letting the girlfriend know you are not avoiding her or have anything against her rather than allowing her to believe she is the issue.", " \u201cIf people wanted you to speak kindly of them then they should have treated you better\u201d paraphrasing Anne Lemott. NTA.", "NTA & your point of view should be one sided since she asked why you are so distant. If your father didn't want to be painted in a bad light then he shouldn't have acted the way he did when you & your siblings were younger. People love to forget that their actions have consequences; they may not always be immediate but they will come eventually.", "NTa. He just had to face the truth and he didn\u2019t like it.", "NTA The most respectful thing you can do for a person in this situation is give her the information to judge accurately so she won't ruin her life. Good job.", "NTA controlling dad is upset he can't control what you tell his girlfriend", "NTA - your father hasn't changed and he'll never change and he doesn't believe he was a bad person. Did you tell her about the incident and could this be something so terrible that new step mom would leave him?", "NTA you\u2019re his daughter not his PR campaign manager", "She asked. You told, that\u2019s life. NTA.", "NTA \n\nShe asked. If the truth makes him look bad, then he should have worked at being a better person.", "NTA. Actually, he made himself look bad, long ago. It\u2019s only catching up with him and new GF now.", "Even if you are one sided as your dad claims, you simply told her why you have limited contact. As long as you didn't tell her, your dad's GF, that she needs to break it off or w.e., you're in the clear. She can listen to the other side and make the decision for herself. It's not up to you to also explain your dad's side. NTA.", "NTA - no one has the right to shape your experience. This is what happened to you and you have to deal with it. Your dad has to deal with the repercussions of his behavior as well, these things can\u2019t get swept under the rug.", " When she confronted your dad, he again wants to spread the fault instead of accepting it.", "NTA.

But it\u2019s really sad that your sisters feel the same way as you, but they go along with what he says to keep the peace.

I guess you'll just have to ask the man who was abusive to me and the rest of my family why I don't want much contact with him? Surely he'll give an accurate and thorough explanation!\"*", "Nothing wrong with setting her straight.", "Definitely not. What you said leaves room for blame to be laid at the wife's feet for the abuse. \n\"Oh, sure, he hit her, but there are two sides. Maybe he isn't taking blame, but you know...she should acknowledge her side too....\"\n\nNo. He's just abusive."]}
