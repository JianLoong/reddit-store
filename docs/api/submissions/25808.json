He looked at my daughter and asked her \"what do you think pumpkin do I look handsome?\" And my daughter looked him in the eyes and asked \"do you want an honest answer or do you want me to consider your feelings?\" That's when I bursted out laughing. My brother didn't say anything and just laughed and left but my parents weren't amused. They think that I'm an asshole and by not punishing her I'm encouraging this behaviour\n\nEdit: \n\nthanks for all the comments. Just to clarify something, my brother is a very handsome man and he knows it and he loves hearing it which is why my daughter's answer was so funny to me. \n\nSome commentors asked me what her \"honest answer\" would be? So I asked her and she told me that \"she thought he looked so handsome but she didn't want to tell him\" lol. I guess it's going to be fine because they are always squabbling like that so I doubt my brother was upset with her answer.", "created_utc": 1693338914, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164siso/aita_for_laughing_when_my_daughter_was_being_rude/", "score": 1202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
