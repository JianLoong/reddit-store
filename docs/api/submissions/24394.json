If your MIL was happy to make the change and is not offended , then it's nothing to do with your Mom.", "NTA...if they're happy, and you're happy, why does your mother need to chime in?", "NTA - if I'm reading this correctly, the family whose traditions are being \"ruined\" is the family asking you to bake, correct? Anyway, if you feel somewhat hesitant that you are replacing their tradition, you could speak to your MIL and ask if you could bake together or something.", "NTA\n\nIt's his family who's asking. You're not imposing at all.\n\nAs long as MIL is ok with it I don't see an issue.\n\nBtw, there can be two desserts in the New Year's celebration lol", "NTA. They ASKED you to make your cake for new years. Well done on your excellent baking skills! This also shows an acceptance of you as part of the family, part of being in relationships is making your own traditions", "NTA. You're not breaking traditions, you're building new ones. I'd be careful not to stomp on old ones, but it doesn't sound like you're doing that here.", "NTA. Talk to MIL about it, though. Maybe she's absolutely tired of baking that cake and is delighted to have someone else to do the tradition.", "NTA. Why can't there be both cakes? No one was ever sad for having more cake available to eat.", "Your boyfriend\u2019s blood relatives seem to be more family than your own.  That\u2019s amazing.  I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nBut only if your MIL is the one asking.  IS she the one asking, or is it just the kids asking?\n\nIf you sense that the MIL was not totally on board with the idea, then pick a different day to make the cake.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is just hating. I think it's lovely that they had a meeting and decided it was now The Cake.", "If the family doesn't mind, and is very happy about it, If the MIL is happy about it then you are doing nothing wrong at all.", "NTA, if the MIL was happy with it then that\u2019s okay, times change. She won\u2019t be around forever.", "NTA at all. If your boyfriend's family asked you to make your cake a tradition, it's their decision. It seems like a nice way to include you in the family. \n\nYou could still share your worries about your MIL to your boyfriend. And you know what, you can make your cake, your MIL can make her cake, you could bake together. There's no such thing as too much cake.", "NAH, except maybe your own mother. Sounds like she's a little envious that you can make such an amazing dessert that your MIL wants it to be a new family tradition. I really can't fault your mom for that, of course she probably wishes she could have it too! But the way she's sowing the seeds of self doubt in you kinda makes her an AH.", "Info: WTF is going on with your mom?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA", "NTA, but maybe sit down privately with your MIL and make sure she was really okay with the change and not just going along with the family. You could always have both cakes if she still wants to make hers. But if she is in her 70s, she might be glad for an excuse to let someone else do the work. Your cake could become a new tradition!", "Nta, also do you have the recipe? I don\u2019t know what I milk cake is but I want to try it!", "I don't know why your mom is getting involved. It sounds like the entire family, *including your MIL*, thinks your cake is just fine and they're not invested in the hazelnut cake.\n\nNTA.\n\nWith that said, if you are willing to share either recipe, I'd love to have 'em!", "Or even three!", "I was thinking the same thing, why not talk to MIL and ask her if she would mind doing both and explain that nobody told you she does this as her tradition.  Good luck.", "No, she loves the cake even tho she\u2019s not a fan of sweets. And she also agrees", "Or twenty-four, one for every hour of the day.", "NTA at all, why is your mother projecting so hard?! Pretty sure your MIL can speak for herself (and she has, as I assume she was part of the conversation where the family decided they\u2019d like you to bake the NY cake from now on). If she\u2019s getting on in years, it may even be a relief for her not to be responsible for the NY cake for a change.   This isn\u2019t breaking the tradition, it\u2019s revamping it to better fit their family, which now includes you and your fabulous cake recipe. I think it\u2019s really sweet!", "You are only ruining it if MIL is unhappy. Does MIL still make the hazelnut cake? Did you ask her if it would be OK to make a new tradition?  Whether or not the siblings asked, there should be respect for their mom. You are NTA, but the kids might be.", "If it upsets the MIL and she\u2019s not a difficult person, let her do her cake and make your cake some other time.", "If your MIL is cool with it then, by all means, bake them a delicious cake.

I'll bet good money she's super happy to be done with that responsibility."]}
