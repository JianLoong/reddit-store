My parents paid for the whole stay and drove us there. I was told we'll meet up with a friend of theirs during the day, someone they met last year on a skiing trip. It took me about 2 slopes to realize that under the glasses and the mask, it was the guy they invited for Christmas at our place a few years ago. At that time, we all drunk a little bit (as in, a few glasses of liquor). That seemed to give that man confidence to text me on Facebook, while sitting at the same table, telling me how cute I am, that my profile picture with my now ex is such a waste and we should go hiking together to take new pictures. Mind you, I never met this man before and he had almost twice my age. As the evening continued, he got more and more daring, trying to organize trips for us and telling me it's rude to think he's worth less because he's older. That I really shouldn't judge him badly for being older, I should give him a chance and so on.\nWhen I got to leave the table, I wasn't feeling sleepy at all and gamed a little. \"A little\" that became hours. I had a gut feeling I should lock my bedroom door and I did. I had accessories hanging on the door handle and my stomach dropped when I saw the handle being repeatedly lower and all the accessories fell. He tried to force the door open several times during the night. I couldn't close my eyes. When morning came, I told my parents and they agreed it wasn't okay. However, he stayed in the guestroom until the last moment for breakfast and my parents \"didn't have the opportunity\" to talk to him. I made comments and SOMEHOW they offered to let him stay for dinner. Their answer to me being upset and telling them I wasn't comfortable with him being there was to tell me to just leave, so I spent that evening sleeping at a friend's house for dinner.\nPoint is, there has never been any consequence for that behavior. My father even included him on friends outings.\nWell back to today. I had to stop at a bar pretty fast because I couldn't see the slopes with watery eyes and it just keeps coming back. I shouldn't be surprised, I knew my parents held no grudge towards him but I wish their solution wasn't \"you don't need to talk to him\".\nThere's a train station nearby. I know I can eventually reach home but I feel like I'd be the holding asshole forever if I just did. I can't warn them in advance because they'd just stop if not threaten me with consequences. \nAITA?\n\nEdit : link to old screenshot (long picture, click on it and pic)\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/random_person_person/comments/11bihwn/extra_screenshot_for_the_aita_story/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "created_utc": 1677321800, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bi485/aita_for_wanting_to_leave_a_family_vacation_they/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
