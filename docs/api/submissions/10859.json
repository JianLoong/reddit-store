Mind you, I never met this man before and he had almost twice my age.

Their answer to me being upset and telling them I wasn't comfortable with him being there was to tell me to just leave, so I spent that evening sleeping at a friend's house for dinner.\nPoint is, there has never been any consequence for that behavior.

Don't leave them wiggle room, don't give them a chance to stop you. \"You knowingly and willfully endangered my safety and well-being, repeatedly, and lied to me about it. This man attempted to assault me in my sleep, and not only did you not protect me, by allowing him to stay, and lying about who he was for this trip, you are complicit in his attempted assault.\"\n\nIf it's so important to your parents that this guy hook up with someone in your family, your mom can have a go. If they aren't comfortable with that arrangement, then maybe they can start understanding BOUNDARIES.", "\u201cPimpin ain\u2019t easy\u2026      \nbecause sometimes your daughter locks her bedroom door\u201d\n\nyeah, ew. So sorry your parents are awful! NTA", "I got out, I'm on my way home. Thank you for asking", "I do, I'll be meeting with them later", "The thing about him trying to get in her room multiple times made me so angry for her. The parents and this random guy give me a true crime documentary vibe.", "Actually, the parents lied. They said they met him last year, and the previous encounter occured years ago! They mislead their daughter.\n\nThey are atrocious \"parents\". Sorry, OP. Definitely NTA.", "They probably want to set op up with him so super gross.\n\nI have seen parents essentially set their children up to be r@ped. Especially if the child is queer, hoping it'll fix them, but it can happen to straight kids as well. Girls/women more than men but it can happen to boys/men, too. \n\nIt's horrible.", "Worse: serving her up on a platter.\n\nMy suspicious nature tells me her parents have an ulterior motive, then *and* now.", "It does not matter.  GET OUT and get away.  Your parents underreacted to this predator and you cannot trust them.\n\nI am literally wtf over here.", "I wouldn\u2019t believe that, and even if he was sleeping somewhere else, you can bet he\u2019ll be staying late and drinking with your parents.", "RUN. It\u2019s not a joke. You\u2019ve got to go.", "Your parents probably gave him the go ahead and told him you're single. Rin and don't look back. If they ask, let them know that they're responsible for keeping you safe and they failed you. The man tried to SA you since it seems he was trying forceful coercion. NTA.", "Good luck OP!", "Glad to know that you are safe.", "I am so glad you noped out of there. Your parents cannot be trusted. They literally lied to you about this person.\n\nI am sorry they are not keeping you safe. You should put max distance to them.\n\nNTA and good luck!", "I\u2019m so relieved that my eyes just watered up! Have a safe journey home. Lots of Internet strangers care about you! \ud83d\udc95", "OP, please sit back, and take a deep breath. Glad you have friends to turn to. I am so sorry your family sucks.  Please let us know when you get home, cause us MaMa bears in this sub are worried for you and want to know. Hope you find some peace somehow.", "I completely agree. Why do these parents invite a single male to stay with them, when they know that their daughter already had a problem with him. It's very creepy.", "I think the parents don't believe her. Maybe they don't think she's outright lying but she \"misunderstood\" and it \"wasn't that bad\" or she's just \"exaggerating.\" They don't want to believe their friend is a fucking creep and so they don't. Un fucking real!", " Yup. Maybe he's rich? Or they owe him a fortune?", "Or maybe he paid for this trip", "For me at least,  it is almost unbelievable because it is like,  who would do that to their kid? I do believe you though OP. You have good instincts ( which you clearly didn't get from your parents!) . Trust your instincts.", "Stranger than fiction is a real phenomenon. Sometimes you really can't make this crazy stuff up.", "Yeah my motto in AITA is \"this maybe isnt real but the world its a fuck up place and probably this happened somewhere\"", "I'm not sure if i'm glad that i wasn't the only one who thought this because i don't want to be paranoid or if i'm even more terrified for OP.\nProbably both."]}
