Your sister has free room and board, babysitting, and taxi service when she's drunk.  She's not going to let go of this easily, especially if she is dealing with an addiction.\n\nMy first suggestion is that you consult an attorney about whether or not a tenancy was created, and if there are any laws that would govern giving your sister notice to move out, and how to go about evicting her if she refuses.\n\nOnce you have that information, you and your husband need to have a discussion with your sister when she is sober.  Tell her she needs to move out and by what date.  Let her know that you are prepared to evict her if necessary, and the impact that will have on her ability to find a place to live.  Also tell her that you are no longer going to be her designated driver when she's too intoxicated to drive, and that she needs to arrange for her own transportation.  I would also tell her that you intend to start charging her for child care at a reasonable rate, and that she needs to contribute to the groceries going forward.\n\nIf you believe that your sister is dealing with alcoholism, you could also tell her that she needs to go to AA meetings or otherwise address her issues with alcohol.  That may mean you need to stop having alcohol in the house for the time being, but it may be worth it in the short term.", "NTA your sister is taking advantage of you and your husbands kindness.", "NTA.\n\nShe's comfortable, and she has no reason to change.

I\u2019m worried how she and your nephew will do if you were to just kick her out- she is your sister after all and abusive relationships duck people up for a long time. Be kind but firm and don\u2019t let her walk all over you!", "NTA: Boundaries are there for you to enforce and it looks like while at first you did your sister a solid to help her out of an abusive situation you ended up enabling her without realizing it. Not a Dr. but I work in the recovery world and it looks like you all could benefit from some recovery services or mental health support in your area. Make certain you put this all in writing and have her sign off on it and hold firm. She needs to maintain a job or might use the lack of work issue to stall an exit. Look up tenancy laws in your area.", "NTA.  How would you feel about asking her to leave and, if possible, becoming guardian for her son until she gets herself straight? I know that is not always a possibility, but it would make sure your nephew was safe and perhaps give her a wake up call.", "I might suggest you look into keeping the child with you.

I would not want to maintain physical custody of him without some kind of legal guardianship, especially since there is technically a custody order with visitation, the father ghosted a couple years ago. But he was very bitter and I\u2019m scared if he hears about her problems he might try to cause problems out of spite.", "That is so hard. Other family?", "hmm...\n\nI wonder if it might be helpful to start charging her rent, but put it into a savings account and (without telling her you intend to do so) gift it back to her when she moves out. She's already not contributing financially, so you wouldn't be losing out on her contribution. It'd get her (back?) into the habit of budgeting/paying bills, and it would leave her a cushion for moving expenses/emergencies/mistakes.\n\nI'd definitely stop allowing her to continue as she is, though.\n\nIt sounds like she's spiraling. For most people, having the pressure taken off helps them to excel, but... unfortunately for some, they *lose* motivation without hard lines and deadlines. It sounds like the more/longer you've helped her, the worse she's gotten. It's not hand-holding anymore, it's just enabling.", "Folks in recovery need to learn how to pick themselves up off the floor but they also need to be on the floor to begin with.

You have to do this all nice and legal.  Otherwise, you will be stuck with her for another year or two.\n\nShe needs counseling to deal with her divorce.  She needs counseling to learn how to be a decent parent.

She will probably still expect you to pick up her son.  Don't do it.\n\nYOU need to start attending Al-Anon meetings - to learn how you are 'enabling' her behavior.  Because of you, she is able to neglect her child.  Because of you, she is able to pretend that she isn't an adult.

You have done enough.", "NTA, but if you are ok with the son, would it be an option for the sister to leave and you hold on to the child so that he stays in a safe home?

That road only leads to a heck of a lot of pain.", "NTA if you set a clear guideline with a prior warning. You would be the asshole if you just kicked them out without giving her a chance to get things in order.

But if she is to stay with you guys, the gravy train has left.\n\nHome from work immediately after. No more after works, no more partying. You say high, smoking weed is one thing, if she is doing coke, she needs to cut that out as well...", "No. Obviously not", "What she is, is an alcoholic. Well, actually, she\u2019s a substance abuser, since it\u2019s alcohol and other drugs, plus having to be picked up from random men\u2019s houses. Also she\u2019s not going out for happy hour, she\u2019s going out for the happy hour drinks. Put my paycheck on that.\n\nShe needs a wake up call, rehab or CPS, her choice. And no more being soft about it either. Frankly speaking, if it weren\u2019t for you guys it\u2019s very likely CPS would\u2019ve already been called, and I\u2019m not sure that would\u2019ve been for the worse either. Whether it happened because she left her child at home alone, showed up drunk for school pick up, missed picking him up entirely, truancy for not getting her son to school in the first place because she never made it home to drop him off, or just getting pulled over for a DUI. All of this scenarios, would result in CPS getting involved. At least this way she has some hope of getting her shit together while you watch the kid, IF she\u2019ll go to rehab. \n\nAlthough, her comment about finally having more money for alcohol due to not paying rent implies to me she was doing this before, and it\u2019s probably why she got divorced. Although I didn\u2019t see anything about the dad so it sounds like he dipped out all together. Which doesn\u2019t speak highly to his character or parenting.\n\nu/sisterisamooch Look, are you willing to take this kid in if it comes down to it? I mean *in* and *from* his mother. Because that\u2019s pretty much where this is headed if she won\u2019t go to rehab. Regardless, you need to start documenting all these instances if you haven\u2019t already. The drunken one stands you pick her up from, the hidden alcohol, anything, and everything. Because even if you get fed up and kick her out, as she is right now, she is not fit to be a parent. You would be better calling CPS now, then leaving her kid to fend for himself with her, homeless, later. You have been parenting in her place, while supporting her drug abuse financially and (as you are already realizing) this is not sustainable long term. And it\u2019s not in the best interest of her kid. He\u2019a is old enough that he\u2019s already starting to pick up that his mom is a substance abuser and is choosing to be an absent high parent over being his mom. And that\u2019s going to require therapy at the very least in the long term. \n\nYou holding down the fort while he\u2019s still being exposed to this behavior isn\u2019t good for him. She needs to step up and get back to being a functional adult and mom, or someone else needs to take him and heal the damage away from her.", "OP, sit your sister down and give her 30 days to leave. Put it in writing. Tell her that you have told her time and time again that you're worried about her drinking and her behavior, you still are, but you can't control her. You CAN have her leave your house.\n\nMaybe when she has bills to pay and has to be home with her kid, things will get better. If not, CPS should be involved.", "Could you just kick her out and let the son stay?", "Have you heard of how drowning people take others down with them? That's exactly what's happening here. It was nice of you to help out, but at this point you are enabling her and you are sacrificing your life for hers. Kick her out.

Please though do keep an eye on her kid and report her if she neglects him.", "NTA once she started working she should of been paying for their food and a share of the bills, whilst she saved her money for a deposit for a place to rent. Once she showed no signs of leaving then you needed her to pay rent. She should of come home from work immediately and any baby sitting outside of work should of been by prior arrangement only. Why on earth have you been caring for her kid whilst she went off gallivanting? Your way of putting your foot down with her and laying down the rules was not to and to go to therapy with your husband instead! What sort of spinless lump are you! You can always kick her out and agree to keep the child until she is stable. She is blackmailing you with, 'I can do what the hell I like because you won't kick out my kid.' Well the defence on that is the kid is welcome to stay, but you are not.", "NTA. The more you enable her, the less likely she will be to get her shit together.", "OP you are NTA but you are an enabler. You have been observing her addiction and letting it worsen. You have allowed her to take the money and time she should have been using for her own home and for taking care of her child to use for drugs and booze. That may have happened anyway but your stepping in as free housing and free child care just allowed her issues to progress faster. I say this as a recovering Alky. You need to do 2 things. Hard date to move and a call to DFS. I hope you will be open to taking care if the child but she will only become worse until she hits bottom. Right now you are preventing the bottom. Don't let her problems drag you down and destroy your relationship too. You can't help her...YOU CAN'T HELP HER.
