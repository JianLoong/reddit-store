Have her start paying rent immediately and contributing towards food. Save the rent for her first and last if you feel responsible. Give her a written notice of the timeline for moving out and have her sign it or she can claim she is a resident and cause all kinds of problems. She should be getting $$$ from her ex as well so the poor me card only goes so far.", "NTA. Put it in writing and stick to it. At this point, you're just enabling her.", "NTA, she is taking full advantage and you are letting her. My knee jerk reaction is to tell her to leave but I'm worried about what will happen to her son.", "YWNBTA.\n\nYou are enabling her behavior by not charging rent and continuing to support her and her son.  Your sister has free room and board, babysitting, and taxi service when she's drunk.  She's not going to let go of this easily, especially if she is dealing with an addiction.\n\nMy first suggestion is that you consult an attorney about whether or not a tenancy was created, and if there are any laws that would govern giving your sister notice to move out, and how to go about evicting her if she refuses.\n\nOnce you have that information, you and your husband need to have a discussion with your sister when she is sober.  Tell her she needs to move out and by what date.  Let her know that you are prepared to evict her if necessary, and the impact that will have on her ability to find a place to live.  Also tell her that you are no longer going to be her designated driver when she's too intoxicated to drive, and that she needs to arrange for her own transportation.  I would also tell her that you intend to start charging her for child care at a reasonable rate, and that she needs to contribute to the groceries going forward.\n\nIf you believe that your sister is dealing with alcoholism, you could also tell her that she needs to go to AA meetings or otherwise address her issues with alcohol.  That may mean you need to stop having alcohol in the house for the time being, but it may be worth it in the short term.", "NTA your sister is taking advantage of you and your husbands kindness.", "NTA.\n\nShe's comfortable, and she has no reason to change. You and your husband are the ones who are inconvenienced, so you will have to force her out of her comfort zone.\n\nPut it in writing that she has until August to find another place.  She'll likely try to place the blame on you and your hubby, so be prepared. Mooches don't like it when they get cut off.", "Nta , if she got money to spend on alcohol, she should spend it on rent. If it was for a year i would have understood. 3 years is a very long time. I also feel she might be abusing alcohol because of her past but still 3 years is enough time to get your affairs on order\n\nYou should talk to her about contribution in rent and grocery. If she doesn't agree then i think kicking her out would be a reasonable thing to do.", "NTA. Look up tenant and landlord laws in your state and make sure you do a legal eviction.", "No, you wouldn\u2019t BTA, but her behavior is going to stay the same or get worse - with the only difference being the kid will be alone. Do you have the bandwidth to keep the kid living with you (with full involvement from mom) and tell her to move out?", "NTA. Give her a 15-30 day notice to evict. If you can afford a lawyer, hire one. You also need advice on how to protect the child, because it sounds like a CPS visit is in her future after she moves out.", "NTA If your sister is working and she has enough money to go to happy hour after work every night then she has enough money to put away for savings. August is more then enough notice. Give her that notice now. If August comes around and she still isn't ready tell her she still needs to leave. If she's not ready it's her own fault. She would have had ample notice by then.", "NTA. August is a very generous amount of time. You have to put your marriage first.", "NTA. It's long overdue and you have been enabling her by not charging her rent.", "INFO: is there a way that you could continue to provide some support for your nephew even if you do have to kick your sister out?

I\u2019m worried how she and your nephew will do if you were to just kick her out- she is your sister after all and abusive relationships duck people up for a long time. Be kind but firm and don\u2019t let her walk all over you!", "NTA: Boundaries are there for you to enforce and it looks like while at first you did your sister a solid to help her out of an abusive situation you ended up enabling her without realizing it. Not a Dr. but I work in the recovery world and it looks like you all could benefit from some recovery services or mental health support in your area. Make certain you put this all in writing and have her sign off on it and hold firm. She needs to maintain a job or might use the lack of work issue to stall an exit. Look up tenancy laws in your area.", "NTA.  How would you feel about asking her to leave and, if possible, becoming guardian for her son until she gets herself straight? I know that is not always a possibility, but it would make sure your nephew was safe and perhaps give her a wake up call.", "I might suggest you look into keeping the child with you. If you cant take him, look for other options. You're describing an unfit mother, and I doubt her behavior will improve once she leaves.\n\nBut as far as having her leave - yes, it sounds like time. \n\nNTA.", "That is my fear too. I know I am holding her hand so I am letting her walk right on the edge. I\u2019m scared if I do make her get an apartment, she will fall of that ledge and her son will be the one suffering for it.", "Absolutely. He is such a little sweetheart and deserves so much better. I would not want to maintain physical custody of him without some kind of legal guardianship, especially since there is technically a custody order with visitation, the father ghosted a couple years ago. But he was very bitter and I\u2019m scared if he hears about her problems he might try to cause problems out of spite.", "That is so hard. Other family?", "hmm...\n\nI wonder if it might be helpful to start charging her rent, but put it into a savings account and (without telling her you intend to do so) gift it back to her when she moves out. She's already not contributing financially, so you wouldn't be losing out on her contribution. It'd get her (back?) into the habit of budgeting/paying bills, and it would leave her a cushion for moving expenses/emergencies/mistakes.\n\nI'd definitely stop allowing her to continue as she is, though.\n\nIt sounds like she's spiraling. For most people, having the pressure taken off helps them to excel, but... unfortunately for some, they *lose* motivation without hard lines and deadlines. It sounds like the more/longer you've helped her, the worse she's gotten. It's not hand-holding anymore, it's just enabling.", "Folks in recovery need to learn how to pick themselves up off the floor but being on the floor to begin with. There are many rock bottoms, but you can not control what her thresehhold for \"rock bottom\" is. The more you pull her up from it the more she will be attached to you in perpetuity. She will never change unless SHE makes the change.", "Her ex\u2019s family are out of state and wrote them off with the divorce. Our parents live in an assisted living facility and will likely need to go to a higher level of care soon as both have medical issues. Both of our parents were only children."]}
