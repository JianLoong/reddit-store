Her husband and her asked if she could stay with me(initiated by the husband). I have known alice since middle school and her husband since university. Their reasoning was that my place was better overall (location, cleanliness, a neighborhood) and closer to where her job was, and then where her company wanted to have her stay. They said it would be about a month. She would help with food and have the company pay me similarly to what they would have paid.\n\nI said that was fine but they don't have to pay me. I'm happy to help out.\n\nSome things about me are that I like to cook, clean, treat everyone with respect, and am a good host. I never mess with anyone in a relationship. I didn't do anything like flirt or talk about their relationship. At least not intentional.\n\nDuring the month, I went about things as normal and tried to reduce the amount of stress Alice was going through with her job.
