Ideally you shouldn't work for them at all.\n\nJust a bit more food for thought: if something happens to your husband like taking from the scaffolding, inform yourself about the consequences. What about insurance, healthcare and on top, this could be seen as \"Schwarzarbeit\".", "Go on a holiday somewhere else and FaceTime them instead\u2026 holidays are not for your husband to become your dads servant.", "$15,000? What on earth? No don\u2019t go visit them if they aren\u2019t going to host you. That is insane", "Nta. I\u2019d be more inclined to send a nice gift and call on her birthday than dropping $15k on a \u201choliday\u201d where your husband won\u2019t rest. \nSpend $1k on a gift and you saved $14k.", "NTA and it might be cheaper to contact someone in the area and hire them to put up the scaffolding before you visit and tell you father you\u2019re so excited to see how the house looks after he\u2019s finished painting. And to just call you when they\u2019re done painting so you can have the people come and take the scaffold down.", "NTA but seriously don\u2019t go - they\u2019re treating you and your husband worse than servants, not like family. \n\nHave they ever spend the money to visit you?", "NTA stay in Australia, the parents don\u2019t deserve you! Do up your own home.", "If your husband is going to do anything you parents need to pay for travels, lodging and transportation expenses.\n\nWhy do you even go visit?\n\nNTA", "NTA for not wanting your husband to spend his holiday working on your parents\u2019 house.\n\nBut why do you want to go? Sounds like your mom won\u2019t actually care if you are present for her 70th birthday ( of course she\u2019ll berate you for not coming but that\u2019s because you seem to be their whipping target ).\n\nSpend the money you have been saving for a family vacation and enjoy yourselves. You guys deserve it", "NTA  - why do you ever want to visit ?  It's time to live your own happy life and forget about your ungrateful parents.", "YTA for yourself and your husband. Dont go...", "NTA\n\nSimply don't go. It's completely unreasonable to expect you to fly half way around the world to work on their house during your vacation time and clearly your parents don't care about seeing you. They just want someone to work for them.", "NTA, it\u2019s your holiday and a very costly one at that. If they pay your husband or for part of your trip it might be different but they expect free labour instead of just enjoy having you all around", "NTA.  You are paying for a very expensive trip.  I don't know how they can call you selfish.  And your husband should demand payment for the things he does for them.  Or just don't go.  Tell them you can't afford it.", "NTA. I would stop visiting them. Or maybe take the kids once every five years. Or go just once when the kids are old enough to enjoy combining it with a trip to see other sites. Or go just yourself once every five years and tell them you don't have the budget to bring the whole family. Set yourself free.", "I would be \u201cgenerous\u201d and offer to buy them plane tickets to Australia to come see you (cheaper than flying there probably). Send a list of nice hotels in the area. Choose a time when tickets are cheap. Don\u2019t spend your holidays there.", "NTA i hope you find a good excuse not to go, this sounds really hurtful", "NTA at all but is your husband even licensed to do his trade in Germany? I\u2019d 100% be using that as an excuse. Sorry dad if husband gets caught we\u2019ll get fined x amount. But honestly fuck your parents, I wouldn\u2019t even visit at this point", "NTA maybe set some boundaries and they can't follow, cut them out. It's hard, but better for the head", "NTA.  No way should you be paying for the privilege of flying there to work for free.  It's a hard thing to reconcile with but they will never be the parents you want or deserve.  I'd save the money and stay home or be adamant you are on vacation and won't be working.", "My dad lives in Europe and I live in America. I moved here 20 years ago. Sometimes I visit him, sometimes he visits me, sometimes we meet for a sunny vacation. He has paid for me and my kids, I've paid for my sisters to come here. Everyone makes the effort. Everyone respects the effort others make to do it. People with more resources chip in for those with fewer resources. When I host them, I plan activities for us to do here. When he hosts me, they plan activities. We all view our limited time together as precious and would never waste it doing a construction project. Although my husband is a handyman, and my dad has done a lot of renovations, the most they might do is walk around the exterior and point things out or exchange advice. They would never dream of asking my husband to work for free on his vacation.\n\nI tell you this because I want you to know the relationship isn't all on you to maintain just because you're the one who moved. If they wanted to they would.", "INFO\n\nHow can type so well while bent over so far?", "NTA. Spending 15k to work on someone else's house sounds a treat.

NTA take five grand, fly to Thailand and spend a month island hopping\u2026or Bali, this is the best time of year, send the folks an invite to join you, or FaceTime them every day at supper time from the beach.

Ostensibly OP only takes, never gives - this is objectively wrong, it costs 15K to go there alone.\n\nStay at home, tell them to visit you. Have they ever done so?", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Forget inviting the parents to OP's home, I would invite the sister and her husband to visit- or meet them halfway and enjoy an exotic vacation elsewhere.", "This is the way! \nDon\u2019t spend money going there and invite them over. \n\nNTA", "This is the way.", "Say your husband can't get away but that you will come on your own. See if the invitation is then withdrawn.", "Woohoo!!! Well said!", "And then tell the dad that they need him to do a lot of repairs when he gets there!", "That\u2019s a great question! Have they ever visited you? I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve kept my parents away from coming to see the granddaughter! Especially if they could reasonably afford it!! \nTake your husband some place relaxing and enjoy time with him and the kids! NTA", "That's my take away too. Why visit these people who are rude and ungrateful and try to Gaslight the daughter into think that she is the one who is rude. NTA\n\nOP, time to put you and your husband first. I'm dealing with this with my mom right now who is in Assisted Living. If I don't go take her something she wants immediately she says I don't care about her and I am selfish. There is no situation in which Coke or granola bars is an emergency", "Oof, I love that.", "Try sending them a bill for all the work husband has done in the past!", "Why invite any of them?? Sis n her hubs live in the same area as parents, THEY should be doing all the work OPs hubs is doing. I wouldn't go at all OP. Not unless they're going to pay hubby for his time and work (which we know they won't)", "Thats actually a great idea. Im going to actually try that one day.", "NTA. Tell your dad your husband will be happy to do it, provided they pay his fee. And, since they are family, he won\u2019t even charge for the surplus of him working while on vacation!", "I was assuming that she wants to see her sister. It is only the parents that she mentioned having a poor relationship with. \n\nConsidering what the parents are like, I don't blame them for not wanting to work unpaid at their house, but of course OP's husband shouldn't have to either. If they want him to work, they should pay for the flight."]}
