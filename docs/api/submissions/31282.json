Your poor husband deserves to not take his work on \"holiday\" with him. \n\nIf your parents can't even show basic appreciation by doing simple things like making your kids a slice, or showing little acts of kindness then they aren't entitled to not even your time letalone your husband's time and skill set.\n\nAs a fellow Aussie, enjoy your summer holidays with a nice holiday, go to the beach, hit up the city for a vacay. Guilt free, no back breaking work for poor hubs.", "You aren't TA.\n\nYour parents are using your DH and are being emotionally manipulative to guilt trip you into doing it.\n\nPerhaps if you aren't staying with them, organise things to do with the kids during the day so when you visit your parents it is of an evening.  Harder to paint in the dark.  You are also spending $15k on a holiday and that means you want to do things with your kids as in visit places etc not hang around the parents place doing jobs for them.", "Not at all the AH. From what I've read, I gather that this disrespect has continued over a period of a few years. And I imagine that the reason you want to go for the birthday despite the expensive nature of the trip is because it's your mum's birthday and that as a child you know it's the right thing to do. \n\nHere is some unsolicited advice though: I strongly think you should rethink if this trip is worth it or not. Worth, both financially as well as emotionally. Your parents sound awful and I feel bad to say it but I think you would be so much better off limiting your kids from that kind of exposure (which luckily seems to be the case anyway by virtue of where you live). But you've held down your own renovations to please people who never put you or your husband and kids in front of their own selfish needs. \n\nAlso yeah ofcourse, put your foot down with the father. He sounds insufferable. Both of them infact. \n\nI hope you take some time to think about this. I also you come back to us with an update in the future.

We\u2019d pay for flights at Christmas, pay for petrol, food shopping, I\u2019d cook clean, wrap presents (she didn\u2019t even wrap anything she\u2019d bought and wait for me to arrive).  \nIt was exhausting, my family was paying to go to her house and wait on her family hand and foot.  We\u2019ve been estranged for over a decade and the weight of constantly being told I\u2019m not good enough, despite doing everything for her, has long gone. Life is good!  Don\u2019t let your family abuse and disrespect you and your husband/kids like this. Be unavailable and have the holiday you want and deserve."]}
