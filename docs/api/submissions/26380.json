I've always wondered why parents keep trying with their adult children who act like this. I assume you feel like you failed somehow. But you didn't. Some people are just bad. No matter what you do, they are lacking empathy and nothing can change that. You can teach them how to fake it to get what they want, but it's never really there. There are personality disorders that if the person doesn't want to work to be good, they just won't be. Signing your kid up for therapy isn't a fix all if the kid doesn't want to work to be better. You cannot control that. You didn't fail or do something wrong. \n\nAnd I guess there's a love there I'll never understand since I don't want kids. But it just boggles my mind that you can put everything into raising a child and have them turn around to act like this, and still love them. I couldn't handle it, thus no kids. I definitely have a I can love you, but not like you attitude when it comes to family. I actively stopped talking to a brother cause I just stopped liking who he was as a person.

It was heart wrenching.  I now know they were this way only because I was still with their father (he was a horrific abuser).  When I left him (more of an escape), they came back to me.  Another of my sons who did move across the country also, was about to move back in a month and he passed away suddenly, he was 22.  Your son may have been trying to mend a bridge.  Just think about how unpredictable life is and maybe allow your son to cross that burned bridge.  Your daughters are free to decide for themselves, and you are also.

Perhaps not unearned - he has brought all this on himself - but the \"I'll think about it if you beg\" line was a bit unnecessary.\n\nI think if he wants you to try and persuade his sisters to have a conversation with him, he needs to produce clear evidence that he has changed.

Your son sounds incredibly exhausting, and I'm sure you can see two wrongs don't make a right.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s a difficult one. Kids behaviour which follows them into adulthood is learned behaviour. They\u2019re not born shitty people but learn it from those around them, in this case probably the parents.

When he said it, he was barely an adult and certainly not mature - having come from a totally shitty parental situation. You called him a \"nightmare\" - he was a damaged kid, not a nightmare.\n\nBasically you, the most mature adult here, lost patience and brought yourself down to the level he was at age 21.

You can\u2019t hold things that he said while his brain was still forming (4 years ago!) against him.\n\nSo, do you feel better for saying that to him?

Clearly the divorce was rough on your son, a teenager which is always a shitty time, and you really didn't do anything about it besides throw your arms up and hope a stranger can fix it.\n\n Then as time went on you all chose to blame his lack of introspection (which again, started as a teenager if probably not sooner) on him being a little shit, with no looking inward yourselves maybe thinking environment and home events had a role to play.", "YTA. Even though I\u2019d probably feel compelled to say the exact same thing to be honest!

There was literally no point in what you said other than to get some satisfaction that your son misses his family and now you get to throw some pain back in his face. \n\nIn your comments you said you don't think you want a relationship with him anymore. Then make that choice and cut him off for good. Don't keep in contact with him unless you're optimistic, which you're clearly not.

But he wasn't coming back begging for drug money, he wanted to rekindle a relationship with his family coincidentally around the age when the human brain reaches maturity and fully understands the consequences of right and wrong. And given it seriously looks like his views of right and wrong were tampered with when he was a kid by you and your ex's awful divorce, I can kind of understand why he turned out the way he did. \n\nBut if he wants to be better, you have two choices.\n\nLet him at least build a better relationship with you and go from there,\n\nOr tell him he's cut off completely and you don't want to talk to him again.\n\nBecause whatever it is you're doing now isn't healthy for either of you.", "Yta.", "YTA", "[removed]", "NTA.

He blamed our mother for all of his problems and just picked on her.

I'm not gonna excuse his shitty behaviour entirely but jesus christ this guy is being thrown through the wringer for not reacting well to events out of his control. I'm gonna say YTA because it's your job as a parent to be the bigger person, instead of making a snarky comment or talking to his sisters you should've spoken with him and tried to repair your relationship with him. \n\nEver consider the reason he asked you to beg is because he's insecure about being wanted after his own father didn't want him, so you begging shows you aren't just inviting him out of obligation but actually want him there cos you love him.

And unfortunately takes it out on his mom and sisters instead of the dad who should be the one getting the brunt of it.", "exactly. after being raised by a narcissist, I can definitely spot the signs of other narcissistic parents.

I'm sorry, I don't buy any of it. You and your partners did something during his formative years that caused these issues.", "Wow, no sympathy for a kid damaged by divorce.\n\nYou lot are cruel.", "Sometimes people are just assholes.", "So, we should stop letting anyone under 30 to make adult decisions because they're \"still a child in the mind\"?", "So no man of 25 can be expected to respect a woman's boundaries?

Guess you're just another misogynist using therapy language to coverup your own manipulations.", "because their mom is likely a narcissist who is triangulating and painting the son as the black sheep. sadistically describing him as being a bully when he was just a teenager - if that was a case, she should have stepped in and prevented it. she failed. instead, now she's ostracized him and painted him as the \"bad\"  person. You should research narcissist scape goats. that dude definitely fits the description.", "And why does that require his mother and sisters to bend to his will?", "No. NO. Getting mom to place pressure on them is a horrible idea, and disrespectful of the sisters and their boundaries. There is no way a mother telling her daughters all this would not feel like Pressure From On High, and it completely disregards the sisters' feelings. He can find a truly neutral party if he wants to reach them. At the very least, if he has to involve his mother, he could take the obvious step to repair his relationship with her. As it stands, it's yet another transactional demand; he only wants to talk to his mom to get her to do something for him.", "Parents are PEOPLE. The job is to raise a healthy and functional adult.

We can only judge based on what she said\u2026and based on what she said he is the problematic not her\u2026if she was the problematic and toxic why would he ever wanted to talk to her again?", "It could be a personality disorder which is often the basis for no context situations. Personality disorders are not curable and are often untreatable.", "You do not seem to understand what no contact means. It's not a mutual decision. People who go no contact usually have been treated so poorly that there is no forgiveness. There's no need for them to be told. As a matter of fact telling them would be highly disrespectful of their decision. \n\nThey get to decide who they have relationships with. Period.", "But the truth is that the son is trying to bypass his sisters' clearly stated boundaries -- crossing their boundaries for him is the favor. The sisters are hard to reach intentionally.", "Yeah I agree, but it sounds like by 15 years old neither of them wanted to know him.

I know you're trying to see both sides of the coin and being empathetic. You can still be empathetic without denigrating a side."]}
