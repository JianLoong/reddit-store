Which means you put some time into networking, by (1) choosing an early-career job at a company that was a launching pad for startup founders, (2) putting time into building a relationship with this guy, (3) maintaining that relationship after he left, and (4) building up a skill set to make you attractive as an early employee, some of which may have involved professional development outside your workplace.\n\nAgain, much of this is consistent with the advice you gave to your cousin. (\"Learn soft skills too; I've progressed wayy more in my career from boldly asking for coffee chats or lunches with leadership than trying to prove yourself through grinding.\")  I absolutely agree that networking is as important as grunt work -- probably more so. Indeed, probably \\*much\\* more so. You want to get noticed. You want to position yourself as a leader, not a worker bee.\n\nSo I am not saying your advice is entirely wrong.\n\nBut equally, it's inconsistent with the advice of \"don't ever 'hustle.'\" For example, if you voluntarily took professional development courses, or networked at an industry association, or authored a piece in an industry journal -- all of that is \"extracurricular,\" in a sense. It's beyond the minimum required by your workplace. But they all benefitted your career. That's \"hustle.\"", "Fine. Just be sure that's what you want over the long term, because good first jobs tend to lead to good second jobs. Choices early in your career will put you on a certain trajectory, and yes, there will be people competing with you.\n\nNot a \"dude,\" BTW.", ">I think that my generation and especially the younger generation is changing the dynamic en masse\n\nYou would be wrong.  The dynamic may be changing.   Those who insist on being at the aggressive forefront though, are not the ones who will benefit from the changes, their careers end up stunted while those who come after benefit in small increments.   That's the way change works.

Idk", "I feel like the advice her gave specifically was meant for his cousin, an accomplished and dedicated student who's likely to be a hardworking anyway (if that makes any sense). \n\nIt's likely she'll get a lot of people telling her to work hard etc. But not many people will give her the Intel OP has. \n\nOh also, NTA :)", "\"Dude\" is a unisex term FYI. Your advice is old school, and things are changing, thank goodness. People are tired of being treated like mules, to be worked to death and then tossed. Employers routinely break laws regarding work hours, compensation, and parity, and knowing your rights (and demanding  them) is NOT being a bad employee. Trying to say so is ridiculous. \n\nYour employer does not have a right to your life. You should not have to work yourself to the bone in order to make a living. This is a ridiculous notion passed down from a generation that likes to talk about how tough it was when we all know that Boomers grew up and entered the workforce during the best economic times the country ever had, and now they're whining about what a bunch of snowflakes the young people are now.\n\nThis is how they justify companies who starve their employees by paying crap wages, by telling young workers that they owe years of shitty apartments and Ramen before they've paid enough dues.\n\nThe system is changing because of people willing to push back on a system that sucks and needs an overhaul.", "A first job that forces hustle culture isn't a good job", "Genuine question... How'd you come to see things that way? \n\nIn my social circle the people who have job hopped often and negotiated hard on interviews and been very selective what work they take, from the start, are earning on average 170k to 230k. They're often seen as thought leaders in their field, and are being very heavily recruited, even during this recession. \n\nThe people who started out in 'hustle culture ' and later started having more self worth in their job search are making on average 120 - 140k now \n\nThe people who have been on their \"rise and grind\" since college are making 80k - 110k now. \n\nI know this because I try to talk salary with as many people as possible, and we also chat about our career views. \n\nAt least around me, the boldest are also the best rewarded. \n\nSo I'm kinda curious, how come you think people who do this stuff don't benefit? Is that something you've seen in your community, if you work in tech? \n\nOr is it something you've moreso read about?

Um, no, it's not -- not by a New York mile. There have always been people who chose to slow-track their careers for family or whatever other reason. Rebranding it as \"quiet quitting\" or \"lying flat\" is just new terminology.\n\nAgain, fair enough. Just be sure that's what you want.  Because if you suddenly decide you want a more lucrative career in your thirties after having been a dishwasher (or whatever) throughout your twenties, you'll be competing against people who made different choices.\n\nThe same is true even if you had a more conventional corporate job but decided not to focus on professional development activities, such as networking. You'll be starting from scratch against people who already have a strong professional network.\n\nAgain, the transition is not \"impossible.\" But it will be more difficult.\n\n2.

I took on projects and tasks and made sure management saw this. I worked on leaving any personal issues I was having at home and having a positive attitude. I made a habit of asking my coworkers more about themselves and talking less about myself.

Unlike with previous interviews where I was nervous, I went in and OWNED that one. The difference, I think, was the confidence I had built and the certainty that the interviewer could call up anyone I worked with and they'd give me rave reviews. \n\nI really owe my new job that I start in a few weeks to the personal changes I made.
