Earlier in the week she asked me if her nephew(4m)who is around 2000 miles away from us could stay with  us for a few weeks, until they can figure something out to give his other sister permission to be a legal guardian because her brother wants to get him out the state they live in the mother does dr*gs. She just gets high and will leave the house for a week with no notice.I said that\u2019s okay even though the thought of legally getting in trouble stresses me. We have a new child of her own to take care of. Then few days later my gf asked if her brother can move with us too. We don\u2019t have the space really and on top of that her family says he is a fugitive. Maybe if that wasn\u2019t the case I might would be okay with that, but my gf keeps saying it\u2019s her brother so she can\u2019t abandon him. Another note her mother has 2 rooms in her house and lives about a hour and a half away from us AITA?", "created_utc": 1668354218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu58i8/wibta_for_telling_my_gf_her_brother_cant_move/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's another option and it sounds as if you're going to live with the whole family by the end of the year.", "He is already a fugitive and will soon have an amber alert out on him after he kidnaps this child. YTA for considering any of this nonsense with a baby in the house. Your girlfriend's an AH too so I'm guessing it's everyone sucks here. It doesn't matter what nephew's mom is doing, how do you think the state will take it when his wanted by the law father kidnaps him? You have a kid to think about and need to put your foot down immediately.", "Noooooo NTA. And that is a giant can of worms.\n\nYou're not allowed to simply box up a kid and send them out of state from their parent. Regardless how messed up the mom is, there needs to be a custody lawyer involved to actually address what rights and legal guardianship is involved.\n\n4 year old also would be starting school soon, and you would have NO legal standing in terms of emergency, medical, or anything else. This is not adopting a puppy or kitten. You could put yourself in legal hot water liability.", "They're literally planning a federal kidnapping with a fugitive.

Move out", "NTA. Hell naw.", "Is it something CPS would get involved in? If so, the answer is no.", "NTA  Stand firm.  You're only getting a filtered story.  You could find yourself caught up in mess that will drag you and your family down.  Who knows what the brother's involvement is in drugs and taking away a child across state lines to hide them from their parent is fraught with problems.  Tell you gf that her brother needs to solve the problems legally at home.", "Don\u2019t take in a fugitive", "NTA he\u2019s not even the one considering it. He was okay with keeping the kid for a few weeks, but is questioning helping the brother out. He may be dumb, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s TA for this. Gf, her brother, brother\u2019s baby\u2019s mother, and rest of the family are definitely TAs though", "> They're literally planning a federal kidnapping with a fugitive.\n\nAND posting about it for discussion on a reddit page with 4,788,920 joined-up people and only god knows how many more lurkers. I truly don't think OP is cut out for a (successful) life of crime...", "NTA\n\nDo not become an accessory in a literal custody kidnapping. Get out of there and make sure to mention to the grandmother what is happening under her roof on your way out.", "NTA, none of this is your responsibility and the brother very likely will be doing something illegal if he doesn't have permission to take his kid out of state against the (even crappy) mothers wishes.", "NTA.  Your gf says it will be a \"few weeks\". Your gf has no way of knowing they can get something worked out in a few weeks, that is probably wishful thinking.  Also if he is indeed a \"fugitive\" and is found to be staying with you and your gf, you both could be charged with aiding and abetting a fugitive and this could impact the stability of your home for your child.  Also. If your brother is a fugitive related to your nephew's custody, you and your gf could possibly be charged with kidnapping, if he is not supposed to have your nephew with him.  Lastly, your child is your primary priority, if Child Protective Services gets involved they, could possibly take your child from you and your gf, by saying you are not providing a safe environment for your child, by knowingly allowing a fugitive to live with you.. And if he is not the custodial parent, your nephew cannot stay with you without risking your own child.\n\nLet them stay with his mother or someone else.  You would never forgive yourself if you lost custody of your child  trying to help your gfs nephew", "NTA. Let's assume he is a fugitive. Harboring a fugitive, depending on where you are, is classified as a felony.
