Earlier in the week she asked me if her nephew(4m)who is around 2000 miles away from us could stay with  us for a few weeks, until they can figure something out to give his other sister permission to be a legal guardian because her brother wants to get him out the state they live in the mother does dr*gs. She just gets high and will leave the house for a week with no notice.I said that\u2019s okay even though the thought of legally getting in trouble stresses me. We have a new child of her own to take care of. Then few days later my gf asked if her brother can move with us too. We don\u2019t have the space really and on top of that her family says he is a fugitive. Maybe if that wasn\u2019t the case I might would be okay with that, but my gf keeps saying it\u2019s her brother so she can\u2019t abandon him. Another note her mother has 2 rooms in her house and lives about a hour and a half away from us AITA?", "created_utc": 1668354218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu58i8/wibta_for_telling_my_gf_her_brother_cant_move/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
