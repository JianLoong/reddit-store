I didn't want to hear his wife talk about how proud she was as a parent, or to have her act like she helped get me here.\n\nMy mom died when I was 12 and my younger siblings were 7, 5 and 4. They all started calling dad's wife mom after they were married for a year. I was 15 and she was never going to be my mom or my parent. But she insisted that I was just as much her kid as her bio kids she brought into the marriage and my younger siblings. My younger siblings hated that I was the only kid in the house not calling dad and his wife mom and dad. It has been a hurdle in our relationship the last three years. They think I'm wrong. I just want them to lay off.\n\nWhen I graduated in May my dad's wife made this whole emotional speech about being a proud mom and watching the oldest baby succeed. Then I got shit from my dad and siblings because I never mentioned her in my speech (this was all during dinner with my whole family, including the extended family) and how I had talked about mom enough to rub her in his wife's face. I told my dad after that it bothered me. That his wife was not my mom and she had not played a role in where I got. I told him he had, my mom had, even my grandma had, because she helped me a lot when I was younger and struggling due to dyslexia and she had been a teacher and an aid for kids with learning disabilities. I said his wife had never helped with homework, or taken me to school or impacted my education in any kind of way. He told me she might have arrived into my life late but she made a significant impact all the same.\n\nSo I didn't tell him about this, so they wouldn't all fly out to celebrate and so I wouldn't have to hear about speech about how she's a proud mom and I wouldn't need to have him and my siblings on my back about showing her more affection and appreciation. My dad told me it was a crappy reason and he told me so many kids would love for her to have that pride in them. I said I was not that person. He told me I needed to apologize, but especially to his wife and her kids who are always on the outside with me and treated like they're not family. I refused.

You're within your rights not to share stuff about your life with anyone, even your parents.\n\nHowever, I don't think you're on some moral high ground either. You sound like you need therapy because you read to me like you have some pent up feelings about losing your Mom and having this new person in your life.\n\nIf she cooked, cleaned, or bought in money toward the household income while you were growing up.. she did contribute to your success. You'd be in a much tougher spot if you didn't have a roof over your head and a hungry growling belly when you were 15 years old.", "INFO: did your step mom ever insist you call her mom? \n\nBecause she can consider you one of her children without you needing to consider her your mom. It sounds like most of the pressure to call her mom came from your siblings, is that fair to say? From the outside it seems like your stepmom is trying her best to be supportive so it\u2019s really hard to fault her for that unless she\u2019s done things to try to erase your mom\u2019s existence.", "ESH- \n1) you have a right to your feelings and your reasons for doing what you did. You didn\u2019t have to tell any of them anything if you didn\u2019t want to and there is no need to apologize for that.\n2) it sounds like you are holding onto a lot of resentment at the lose of your mother. And it sounds like stepmom (by legal definition), did what she could to help you growing up. You never said anything negative, just that she didn\u2019t participate as much as you would have wanted. But you were the oldest of what sounds like atleast 6 kids, which is a lot of kids, and you would have needed the least help. I\u2019m not saying you should be calling her mom, but it sounds like she did what she could with her situation. It\u2019s not like she ignored you or negatively hurt you. She cooked, cleaned, did laundry, probably worked and brought in an income to keep the house going.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, if she actually loved you, she would of respected your wishes.

It's what has created this distance and will continue to do so for as long as they persist in \"being right.\" I also feel bad for your mom for being so completely replaced by your step mom. Which I imagine you also feel more acutely. Please remember that your family is in the wrong, your feelings are your feelings and are valid.", "NTA, sounds like your father and stepmother are not only not respecting your autonomy and that you have your own wishes, but are trying to erase the presence of your mother since your siblings were young enough to forget about her.\n\nThey are the ones treating you like you're not family", "Do we have the same stepmom? Mine does the exact same and I was a senior in high school and hadn\u2019t lived in the same state as my dad for 5 years when they married. \n\nIt annoys the crap out of my mom. She\u2019ll talk about how she can\u2019t believe we aren\u2019t related because we have similar personalities. I could count the number of times I had been around her with one hand. \n\nI just ignore a lot of what she says. She\u2019s a good person at heart, and she\u2019s a lot better then the witch that used to be my stepmom. \n\nIt does get annoying though, because it\u2019s all BS.

I'm not going to call you an asshole, but I'd like you to re-evaluate how you treat this person whom your dad obviously loved enough to marry.  It almost sounds like you are being purposely mean to her - I think mom would expect better from you. Loss of loved ones are tough (trust me I know), maybe you need to go to some counselling (grief or therapy) to help with the pain you are carrying, and pushing it on someone who is obviously trying to be there for you - not replace your mom, but be a supportive person in your life.  Keep doors open for others to help with your journey!!\n\nYou don't have to like her, but you should try and respect her. Kindness matters - and while you are still young, and haven't learned many of life's lessons, at the end of the day, family matters - especially when they are supportive.

This is not your problem, and you are justified in not wanting to be forced to act a way and express feelings that make \"her\" feel better but make you feel worse because they are inauthentic.  Stick by your guns and if this happens again, just as kindly as possible, explain your feelings.", "Yta", "Guess he made his choice huh?

Make sure your clothes were washed?  All of the little things a mom does to keep you moving?  Maybe she didn't do all of the other stuff she mentioned, but she listened to you and helped you in other ways.  I understand the difficult relationship between bio and step, and it is difficult for both parties.  She wants to hope she made a difference in your life (and yes that is always debatable) and you want to keep your mom alive in your memories, afraid if you give an inch, you will betray her memory.

Whilst she is not their Mum she has contributed to their lives and deserves to share their successes in life.

It was only right.", "NTA \n\nThat seems to be the reoccurring consequences with stepparent that push kids to accept and call them mom or dad. Sorry you are going through this and hope you guys can eventually get to some common ground. Maybe you should speak to her about this and ask her to just stop with the whole mommy thing and you really don\u2019t set out to hurt her but she needs to just stop where you are concerned.

It\\`s his choice if he wants to remain a part of your life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add:  Your strength of character, you must have gotten than from your mother. You are making her proud for sure!", "Congratulations OP! NTA.", "How the h\u00a3ll can your stepmother refer to you as the 'oldest baby' when she didn't even meet you until you were 15? It's not hard to see why you don't like it.\n\nIt's a shame; perhaps if she'd kept a loving but respectful distance from you rather than trying to force affection, you might have developed a better relationship with her. Fault lies with stepmother as the adult, not you as the child. NTA", "NTA Oh honey they all act like you are the problem. But in truth they don't understand your feelings and they don't want to. They are pushing your boundaries and they are pushing you away. You already have a Mom and she can't take that spot.", "NTA. Stand your ground. It's a sin they are trying to wipe out your mother's existence. You exist because of her. She carried you for 9 months as did she your younger siblings. I would ask your stepmom for pictures of her carrying all of you (step siblings) in her stomach? Where are the birth pictures? hmm? Your siblings are pieces of work. How dare they disregard the woman who gave them LIFE. Who loved and cared for them until she sadly passed away at too young of an age. I am so sorry this has happened to you. Your mum is with you, I promise and no doubt is incredibly proud of the person you have become.", "You are absolutely, NTA. Stepmom is trying to copy/paste herself into a motherly role. \n\nFuck that. She can be loving and supportive without being unbearable about it. \n\nIt sounds like she makes these things about HER and not you.. Just gross.", "NTA. You told him \"I didn't want everyone to make my happy thing about her\" and he immediately made it about her. Like what was he expecting that to change? Or was really cruel of him to say you're \"worst of all\". It's cruel of your siblings and him and your SM to force this relationship on your again and again and again and again. She can absolutely manage to be proud of you as a SM without taking credit.\n\nUnfortunately it appears this is a problem not going away anytime soon. If you're still in school, see if they have any therapy options for students. It will be good for you as clearly you've never been allowed to mourn properly or settle into the new family dynamic your own way and pace. It may also help you learn how to set boundaries with your family to try and cut down on their bad behaviour - whether by them learning to drop the issue and just behave like family, or by you learning to be ready, comfortable and skilled at ending those conversations and removing yourself from the emotionally manipulative atmosphere with minimal exposure to manufactured drama.\n\nAnd from a stranger - congrats on your achievement! Well done on the hard work you put in to get there! I'm sure your mom would be very proud of you.", ">he told me so many kids would love for her to have that pride in them.\n\nNo, they wouldn't. Most people would find it either creepy or asshole behavior to co-opt your accomplishments to make it about them. You're an adult now, there's no going back to apologize to people that you don't consider part of your life unless your dad is paying for something. NTA.\n\n>He told me she might have arrived into my life late but she made a significant impact all the same.\n\nIn a negative way it sounds like.", "NTA but is it possible your stepmom did more than you give her credit for or even realize? Did she do your laundry, make family meals, but Xmas and birthday gifts, try to make holidays special for you? I only ask bc I didn\u2019t realize how much a mother does behind the scenes until I was one. Might help you find some perspective. Are you willing to talk one on one with her about it?", "Nta", "But but they're so accepting and proud of him! They worked so hard to remind everyone how great their family is! Why can't he just get with the program and recognize how awesome they are!?\n\nIn all seriousness, NTA. I would have felt the same if my  biological parents had ever claimed credit for my success, let alone a step parent."]}
