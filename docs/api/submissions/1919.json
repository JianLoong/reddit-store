Two months in and I got offered an apprenticeship that's in the field I always wanted to be in. The deal is I do two years in college while training on the job. A few of my friends threw a party to celebrate but I didn't tell my dad until after I had accepted and had started with the placement. When he did find out he wanted to know why I'd waited so long and I told him the truth. I didn't want to hear his wife talk about how proud she was as a parent, or to have her act like she helped get me here.\n\nMy mom died when I was 12 and my younger siblings were 7, 5 and 4. They all started calling dad's wife mom after they were married for a year. I was 15 and she was never going to be my mom or my parent. But she insisted that I was just as much her kid as her bio kids she brought into the marriage and my younger siblings. My younger siblings hated that I was the only kid in the house not calling dad and his wife mom and dad. It has been a hurdle in our relationship the last three years. They think I'm wrong. I just want them to lay off.\n\nWhen I graduated in May my dad's wife made this whole emotional speech about being a proud mom and watching the oldest baby succeed. Then I got shit from my dad and siblings because I never mentioned her in my speech (this was all during dinner with my whole family, including the extended family) and how I had talked about mom enough to rub her in his wife's face. I told my dad after that it bothered me. That his wife was not my mom and she had not played a role in where I got. I told him he had, my mom had, even my grandma had, because she helped me a lot when I was younger and struggling due to dyslexia and she had been a teacher and an aid for kids with learning disabilities. I said his wife had never helped with homework, or taken me to school or impacted my education in any kind of way. He told me she might have arrived into my life late but she made a significant impact all the same.\n\nSo I didn't tell him about this, so they wouldn't all fly out to celebrate and so I wouldn't have to hear about speech about how she's a proud mom and I wouldn't need to have him and my siblings on my back about showing her more affection and appreciation. My dad told me it was a crappy reason and he told me so many kids would love for her to have that pride in them. I said I was not that person. He told me I needed to apologize, but especially to his wife and her kids who are always on the outside with me and treated like they're not family. I refused. He said that made me worst of all.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668026405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqux57/aita_for_not_apologizing_to_my_family_for_not/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell your dad he would not have appreciated you forgetting him and all he's done for you and replacing him on demand with your mother's next husband if he'd been the one who died.

From prior experience you know that your step-mother would have taken center stage and tried once again to take credit for your success.  It's as if your father and step-mother completely erased your mother from existence.  The fact that  your younger siblings have accepted her as \"mom\" must be all the more painful.   \n\nThere are other milestones ahead in your life; graduation, relationships, your first job, maybe getting married or having children, etc.  Draw a hard boundary now with your father and step-mother.

She doesn't (shouldn't) have pride in your accomplishments, because she had nothing to do with them, but still wants to make them about herself.\n\nYou Dad's response proves you were right for not inviting them.

You're within your rights not to share stuff about your life with anyone, even your parents.\n\nHowever, I don't think you're on some moral high ground either. You sound like you need therapy because you read to me like you have some pent up feelings about losing your Mom and having this new person in your life.\n\nIf she cooked, cleaned, or bought in money toward the household income while you were growing up.. she did contribute to your success. You'd be in a much tougher spot if you didn't have a roof over your head and a hungry growling belly when you were 15 years old.", "INFO: did your step mom ever insist you call her mom? \n\nBecause she can consider you one of her children without you needing to consider her your mom. It sounds like most of the pressure to call her mom came from your siblings, is that fair to say? From the outside it seems like your stepmom is trying her best to be supportive so it\u2019s really hard to fault her for that unless she\u2019s done things to try to erase your mom\u2019s existence.", "ESH- \n1) you have a right to your feelings and your reasons for doing what you did. You didn\u2019t have to tell any of them anything if you didn\u2019t want to and there is no need to apologize for that.\n2) it sounds like you are holding onto a lot of resentment at the lose of your mother. And it sounds like stepmom (by legal definition), did what she could to help you growing up. You never said anything negative, just that she didn\u2019t participate as much as you would have wanted. But you were the oldest of what sounds like atleast 6 kids, which is a lot of kids, and you would have needed the least help. I\u2019m not saying you should be calling her mom, but it sounds like she did what she could with her situation. It\u2019s not like she ignored you or negatively hurt you. She cooked, cleaned, did laundry, probably worked and brought in an income to keep the house going.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, if she actually loved you, she would of respected your wishes. She doesn\u2019t as she continues to force things to fit HER narrative. If she actually loved you, she would realize she is causing you to drift from your siblings and father but she doesn\u2019t care as long as she gets her way.", "NTA their unwillingness to validate your feelings as a child and now into adulthood is very sad. It's what has created this distance and will continue to do so for as long as they persist in \"being right.\" I also feel bad for your mom for being so completely replaced by your step mom. Which I imagine you also feel more acutely. Please remember that your family is in the wrong, your feelings are your feelings and are valid.", "NTA, sounds like your father and stepmother are not only not respecting your autonomy and that you have your own wishes, but are trying to erase the presence of your mother since your siblings were young enough to forget about her.\n\nThey are the ones treating you like you're not family", "Do we have the same stepmom? Mine does the exact same and I was a senior in high school and hadn\u2019t lived in the same state as my dad for 5 years when they married. \n\nIt annoys the crap out of my mom. She\u2019ll talk about how she can\u2019t believe we aren\u2019t related because we have similar personalities. I could count the number of times I had been around her with one hand. \n\nI just ignore a lot of what she says. She\u2019s a good person at heart, and she\u2019s a lot better then the witch that used to be my stepmom. \n\nIt does get annoying though, because it\u2019s all BS.

I'm not going to call you an asshole, but I'd like you to re-evaluate how you treat this person whom your dad obviously loved enough to marry.  It almost sounds like you are being purposely mean to her - I think mom would expect better from you. Loss of loved ones are tough (trust me I know), maybe you need to go to some counselling (grief or therapy) to help with the pain you are carrying, and pushing it on someone who is obviously trying to be there for you - not replace your mom, but be a supportive person in your life.  Keep doors open for others to help with your journey!!\n\nYou don't have to like her, but you should try and respect her. Kindness matters - and while you are still young, and haven't learned many of life's lessons, at the end of the day, family matters - especially when they are supportive.  Good luck with apprenticeship!!!!  You got this!", "She and the whole family sound exhausting to even have a conversation with. I don't blame OP one bit. NTA", "i agree with this. it's hard to read the tone of the mother's behavior through this post. even when OP says she never helped with anything, is it because she didn't try, or because she was respecting that he wanted distance? \n\nnot to say that OP is wrong to feel these complicated feelings, at all. he has the right to have this boundary. and his siblings judging him for it is so cruel. i just can't tell if she herself is boundary-stomping, or if the boundary-stomping from his family has just made her actions painful for OP no matter what she herself does. either way i feel really terrible for him.", "No it sounds like a step mom trying to muscle in and be his mother. They're not the same thing.", "I disagree."]}
