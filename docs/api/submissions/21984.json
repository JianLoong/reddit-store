Threatening your sibling with outing them for the sake of pressuring them for self serving reasons is crossing that line. There may be people who excuse her for this because of her age at the time- but, I think she was certainly old enough to know better, and old enough to be held accountable. This was a really fucked up, screwball thing for her to do to her own family. \n\nThe thing with trust is that once someone shows you their character, it\u2019s hard to unsee. Your sister showed you that, at almost 18, a legal adult, she was willing to blackmail you with sensitive information for personal gain. That\u2019s not how you treat someone you love. People can and do grow, however your sister having a total meltdown the way she did, for the reasons she had it, tells me she probably is still that shallow, selfish person she was when you were 17.  \n\nWhat you are doing is *smart*. She chose to be untrustworthy, and you are choosing to respond to that by not giving her the opportunity to betray your trust again.

I always say once someone show you their true colors, believe them. What she did was awful it may have been years ago, but the hurt and resentment is still there.

Clearly she broke your trust when you were in the teens, when you needed a sibling and a friend to be understanding.

She didn't just do one harmful thing, she changed your view of who she is. That's not something that just goes away with time. Trust is something you have to rebuild.

Going to be honest even if she did, the trust is likely permanently gone, but wanted to check.  This is also a potential way to get your brother to shut up about it.

By time we started high school I was so done with her and refused to tell her anything about myself. At one point my parents invited her over to stay with us during the summer and made me let her stay in my room with me, she used that time to try to find out things about me to get me in trouble and when that didn\u2019t work she turned around and told the entire family that she had slept with my boyfriend so they would hate him because she saw him give me a promise ring and she was jealous. I always knew her behavior stemmed from jealousy and that last thing happened when we were 17, were now 29 and I haven\u2019t had a relationship with her since back then.
