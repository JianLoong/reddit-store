I have a hard time seeing how this is going to work. He wants you to move into his small cabin in the woods where you would be isolated from your community and he will not offer any compromise? Yikes. What do you get out of this arrangement, if the property would not even be yours?\n\nAlso, you could totally build a tiny home that can be moved. Your daughter could have a home that she can move around after college, or she can choose to sell it and have some money to get started with. \n\nSince you would be paying for your daughter's home, why wouldn't he pay for his daughter's home?", "It would be such a huge mistake to move in with him, in circumstances that are demonstrably worse for everyone (especially you).\n\nYour daughter apparently lives with you right now, and will continue to do so through college. You and your daughter are your priorities and responsibilities here.\n\nI guess you're NTA for not building his kid something...but there's so much wrong with everything here that it seems beside the point. Don't build on this self-centered guy's land. Don't give up what works in your life to live where he chooses. What compromise is even being offered from his side?", "YTA for giving into him at all, if he wants to live in a shed in the boonies that\u2019s on him but your daughter shouldn\u2019t be dragged along.", "So his compromise for you to do something you don't want to do is for you to use your money to increase the value of his property to benefit his child while decreasing the quality of life for you and your child?\n\nNTA and you also may need to reframe some things. You moving there is something he wants. He needs to make the compromise and use his money to make you and your child welcome.", "NTA.\n\nTell him to FO. If he wants you to move in with him, which is inconvenient to you, then he needs to learn how to compromise. What are you getting from this arrangement?\n\nAlso no, it's not inconsiderate to assume your 18 year old daughter would not want to share a 2 bedroom cabin with her mom, step-dad and 14 year old step-sister. \n\nBut the worst is that he doesn't consider your daughter a part of the family, or even you as a potential inheritor to the property you are now supposed to start a family in. If you are to move in with this man then make sure he realises that he is expected to treat your daughter as it was his own.", "Don't move him with him, he is not good for you nor your daughter.", "YTA for desperately trying to salvage a relationship detrimental to your daughter.", "NTA. He is intrested in your wallet, not you.", "DO NOT MOVE IN WITH HIM!!!\n\nNTA", "Why would you move into his cabin in the woods with him when it's so inconvenient for you and obviously not welcoming to your daughter? Also does his daughter never visit? He's so worried about giving her a share even though he doesn't seem to care about having a place for her either.", "OP,  YTA for the way you are treating your daughter. You absolutely have to sit down by yourself and decide where this is going. It is clear as day that you are more well off than him and he is trying to soak some inheritance for his daughter.\n\nYou need to decide if this is what you want. YOU HAVE 0 OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE FOR HIS DAUGHTER. If I was you I would make a will immediately and keep separate finances. Make it abundantly clear to him this and you will not financially support him or his daughter.\n\nOf course, you may decide you want to support his daughter. If this is the case you might as well just agree to do the same for his daughter since she is getting half your stuff anyway\n\nEdit: After reading this again it is a very weird situation. First I would like to say it is a shady place to live. Maybe he already owned the land and you are just renting your place. If this is the case then it might make sense and it isn't sus as it is a long term settling option besides paying rent/a new mortgage.\n\nThe second thing I'm after realising is the tiny home is being build on his property. To me this makes no sense. I originally wrote about how each parent doesn't owe anything to step children. After rereading it doesn't make sense for him to allow it in the long run. The relationship seems volatile and if ye break up what happens to the tiny home? Even if ye work out it can't work long term as the property is being given to his daughter (as it should be) so the tiny home will be a big point of conflict.\n\nThe third thing is I don't understand why you need the tiny home in the first place daughter. I know it's small but as long as she has her own room it wouldn't be the world's worst. If ye have decided it won't work then you should be looking at other options besides your daughter living on the lawn. She's 18 and can live by herself. It actually makes financially more sense to rent her a place of her own rather than build a temporary place that qoute \"his daughter can have when she turns 18 in 4 years\". It would cost a minimum of 40k for something more decent than the room in the cabin. She could easily rent for 4 years for this if you want to help her out.\n\n\nI agree your daughter needs her own space but moving her into your lawn is not the right answer.\n\n\nNow the final part I find very weird and confusing. He will compromise if you build his daughter a tiny home too. If I was him I wouldn't compromise in the first place and flat out reject any tiny house. If you want to get very technical though maybe he is looking it as a trade though? Like he will \"sell\" the land for a tiny house for your daughter if you \"pay\" him by building him a tiny home. I mean I guess it kind of is a fair swap considering the value of a site?\n\nAlso it now appears to me that I was wrong when I said op was financially more well off and this agreement would benefit his daughter more than ops. It now appears that he is better off as she appears to be renting and his daughter would be worse off if OP build a tiny home on her property. I guess a second tiny home for her would be fair compensation?", "Nta, he wants you to move, into a 2 bedroom cabin with your daughter 18 and make her share with his daughter 14 whenever she comes to visit.  You offered the compromise of building your daughter a tiny home on the property for her to have more privacy. And he said only if YOU build his daughter one too.  \n\nGirl run, cause this man is something else honestly.  Sounds like he doesn't want your daughter in the picture to me. She 18 and since she is not his child he might be trying to force you to push her out the nest consciously or unconsciously. Also he may be hoping that if you move in she might not want to come because it is so small and she would have no privacy. If his daughter is there when yours is there who gets the second bedroom? If the house is already small it doesn't sound like it can fit 2 teenage girls. Your daughter might begin to feel as if she is unwelcome in a place that she should be able to consider home. But instead might feel like a uninvited guest. \n\nHe built 2 bedrooms for a reason, one for yall and one for his daughter.  \n\nBut I think getting her a tiny home no matter what is a great idea, especially if it can travel.  Maybe she could take it to school and save money on room and board while there, then when she graduates she has a home and can relocate anywhere if needed for a job. Or she could sell it, or even maybe rent it out to future students.", "NTA, do NOT move in with him", "NTA but don't move in with this guy. He's self absorbed and weird.", "You would be crazy to move in with him.\n\nYou would be even more crazy to pay for a building on his land. Unless you have a secure, watertight agreement if anything happens to him that is his daughter's place you and your own daughter would be gone and have no rights.\n\nHe has made it clear the property is for HIS daughter and that is non-negotiable as far as he is concerned. Why are you even considering this?\n\nHe has made it clear it is him and his daughter (and you for now). Don't give up what you have for this.", "I kind of feel like you\u2019re the AH for giving up your own comforts to live with him and making all the compromises. You might want to think about treating yourself better.

Then when she leaves, or you leave, it can be taken with you. \n\nIf he has a 2 bedroom house, and a daughter then the second room *should* be her room.  She doesn't need her own house.", "INFO: why can't your 18 yo live in the second bedroom?", "YTa for oh so many reasons.", "YTA\n\nIts his property.
