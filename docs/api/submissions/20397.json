Their father, let's call him Jim (44M), and I got divorced when I was pregnant with my youngest due to him cheating on me with another woman, getting her also pregnant. After the divorce I moved back to my hometown and Jim chose to stay where he lived. He didn't fight or made any effort for custody until our oldest was 6 years old and he requested to meet them. He only sees them barely once a year and calls every few months. \n\nJim is visiting town and requested the girls go with him for an overnight visit. As they are older I thought it would be fine. I asked him what the plans were and he said he was having a party with his family and was going to be roasting a pig (it's tradition where I live). I asked if there was alcohol involved and he said yes but that he'd make sure to be sober enough to watch our daughters. I reluctantly agreed. \n\nWhen the girls got back I sat them down and asked how the party was. They were happy and said they had a lot of fun. I asked them details, how Jim behaved, if he attended their needs, etc and they told me that Jim got drunk at the beginning of the night and that he offered them beer, they refused obviously and asked for icecream instead. After that Jim proceded to let some random cousin (22M) of his, I haven't even met, take them out for ice cream at 9 pm. \n\nThey ended up being out until 11 pm, and in all that time Jim didn't bother to check on them.\u00a0 When the girls arrived at their father's they had dinner and went to sleep. I couldn't believe how he could be so irresponsible to offer our underaged daughters alcohol and send them off with a stranger because he was so drunk he couldn't walk straight. \n\nI called Jim and told him he wouldn't be taking the girls unsupervised ever again. He said I was being controlling and the girls were fine. I said I wouldn't allow him to endanger our daughters when he barely bothers to show up once a year and can't even go one night without drinking. I decided he wasn't responsible enough to care for them and in the future either I'm going or the girls are not. He called me an asshole and hung up.

How is that okay? They're still children who need to be safe and feel protected. If he was serious about having a relationship with them, he should have rather taken them for ice cream to spend some quality time with them before the event.", "...I dunno why you chose to trust this guy with an unsupervised visit after he didn't contact you regarding the kids for six years. I bet he didn't pay child support either which is ALWAYS a red flag. I guess I'll vote NTA though.", "NTA.  Depending on where you live, you may need this in your custody agreement.", "NTA\n\nHowever, it would be best to have that supervised visitation restriction approved by court as fast as you can, so he can't pull the \"parental alienation attempt\" card.", "Nta - he has shown you who he is.", "NTA. But to be on the safe side - get a legal counsel involved and make this rock solid.", "Ehs. How far away did you move with the children. Did you try to alienate him from his own kids. I've known so many women who get bitter and angry. Don't allow your child's father to be in their lives. \n\nI had a friend in high school whose mother told him his dad was a deadbeat and wanted nothing to do with them. It turned out she was lying to him for years. And manipulating the situation.\n\nHe sucks for being an irresponsible parent. And getting drunk when having custody of the kids.", "Eh\u2026 no. Not really. But he is their father, and you chose to have not one, but two kids with this man, so while you\u2019re not an asshole, you\u2019re not innocent either. He has every much of a right to be a parent as you do, they are his kids too- not saying that what he did was even remotely okay, but you don\u2019t get to just unilaterally decide about his relationship with his daughters.", ">After the divorce I moved back to my hometown and Jim chose to stay where he lived..He didn't fight or made any effort for custody until our oldest was 6 years old\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYou're right not to allow further unsupervised visits because of the issue at the pig roast. No problem. You went into asshole territory when you started with the blast-from-the-past remarks.\n\n**You moved the kids away** from their father originally, **and he let you.** Apparently neither of you cared much about trying to keep both a father and a mother in your kids' lives. \n\nHe sounds like a deadbeat dad for the most part, but your kids don't seem to think so.  You're about to be cast as the villain here if you sever what little relationship they have so tread lightly.", "YTA.\n\nTo be honest, it seems like you are angry at him for your past issues, so you are going nuclear for what you deem acceptable. Nothing he did seems particularly bad, and you may want to be careful about threatening supervised visits, as he may take you to court. Sorry, but taking kids for ice cream at 9 will not deem supervised visits.\n\nThe better solution would be to talk like sensible adults about co-parenting expectations. Both of you guys can come up with plans and discuss parenting styles. You had the kids to yourself all these years, but now that he is stepping up, let him be a parent and do not let your hurt affect that.", "ESH.\n\nI get being ticked about him offering them alcohol and getting drunk when he promised not to but I\u2019m afraid he didn\u2019t send them off with a stranger. The person is only a stranger to you and could well have been the only sober person present, and therefore the safest option for the children.\n\nI do understand your desire to set limits on how he spends time with his daughters given the alcohol issue, but be careful about hard lining restrictions unless you are dead certain he\u2019s not the type to take you to court over it because it could be very messy. Deadbeat or not he does have legal rights.\n\nYour eldest is more than capable of calling you should should she ever feel her and her sister are unsafe, as long as you make certain she has the means to do so.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your daughters were not adequately supervised and you are lucky that no harm came to them. I doubt the courts would give him anything but supervised visitation this display of irresponsible behavior.", "NTA. Anything could have happened. What if he was so drunk a stranger walked up and took your children? He was very careless.", "NTA.  Can you legally unilaterally decide he can only see them supervised? If not, run don't walk to your lawyer and get it changed before he gets you in trouble out of spite.", "This is my brother. Used to see his daughter every other weekend at my parents. Except the visits were usually go pick her up, then fuck off for a few hours to smoke crack, would come up for meals and a \"visit\" then would leave again for hours. When my parents finally had their supervision rights revoked (for allowing this to happen so often it would occasionally turn into physical altercations) there was no sympathy. All I had to say was, \"what's he really losing here? You're the ones that have lost your grand daughter every other weekend because you want to enable a drug addict. That's your choice, live with it.\"", "To be fair to OP she mentions he has another daughter with the person he ran off with so I see why she gave him a chance, never again though oof", "If he wanted to be a father, he wouldn't have gotten drunk and pawned them off on someone else. As the girls' primary caretaker (he rarely sees them), she not only has the right, but the obligation, to keep her children safe.", "He was out of the picture for 6 years and tried introducing his daughters to alcohol. So, not really.", "He's not a parent.  Parenting is a lifetime commitment, starting at birth. \n\nHe didn't see the girls at all for six years.  After that, he's seen them maybe once a year, and an occasional phone call.\n\nHe's a stranger, who happens to be genetically related to the girls.\n\nSince he was cheating when the younger girl was born, and OP moved away, the younger daughter didn't see him at all for the first six years of her life, an has seen him probably less than a dozen times over her entire life.  And while he was around for the first couple years of the older girl's life, she was far too young to remember him, or have developed a relationship that would resonate now. \n\nPlus, he was horribly reckless with the girl's safety.  He offered them beer.  He sent them off alone with a stranger.  I hope nothing bad happened, but if they're okay, it is luck, not through any care or caution on the so-called father's part.\n\nHe didn't want the girls at this party because he cares about the girls.  He wanted them as props to show off to his family, about how he's an involved father.  When he's neither involved nor in any sort of fatherly role.\n\nHe needs to earn his way back into OP's trust.  And he needs to recognize that he's a stranger to the girls, and he needs to do the work of developing a positive relationship with them, before having them alone.\n\nBeing a parent isn't a right.  It's a responsibility.  He's neglected the responsibility for a decade, he can't just decide that he can pick things up as if he had actually done the work of establishing himself as a parent.", "> He has every much of a right to be a parent as you do, they are his kids too- not saying that what he did was even remotely okay, but you don\u2019t get to just unilaterally decide about his relationship with his daughters.\n\nYes, she does, because from the sounds of it she has full custody.", "No. Their father provided no supervision to children because he was too drunk. He offered alcohol to kids, aged 11 and 13. He obviously doesn\u2019t have court ordered supervision, and mom is the custodial parent. He handed supervision over to someone unknown by mom. He has no right then to visitation. He could go to court to try to get that right, but based on his behavior, he\u2019d be unlikely to get approved.\n\nBesides all this, OP isn\u2019t cutting all contact; she\u2019s only saying she must also be present to provide responsible supervision, which seems appropriate.", "If he wants to see his daughters more regularly, he can go to court.   I can't imagine that they will be super impressed by his actions.", "> You went into asshole territory when you started with the blast-from-the-past remarks.\n\nHow did she do that?\n\nShe had no legal obligation to let the kids see him, yet she chose to give him a chance and he promptly blew it.\n\nDefinitely NTA.", "For real. She was angry at the guy for cheating, so she took the kids away, and he is made to look like a deadbeat because he did not fight it. Lame.", "Lol this is such a ridiculous take. \n\n>>Nothing he did seems particularly bad\n\nSo there's nothing wrong with offering beer to 11 and 13 year olds? \n\n>>Now that he is stepping up and being a parent\n\nIf you think what this guy did counts as \"stepping up and being a parent\" then your standards are subterranean.", " *Deadbeat or not he does have legal rights*\n\nThen he's free to assert them.  I can't imagine most judges siding with the dude who abanded his kids for six years and gets completely plastered the one day a year he sees them.", "He asked his cousin to get the ice cream?  That's not pawning them off, especially if he was concerned to drive cause he had a drink.\n\n\nI also don't believe a 11yr old and 13yr old said dad was drunk early.  I doubt they would even know what to really look for.  It was probably more dad had a beer and OP translated that to drunk\n\nOPs ex is an AH for offering them drinks plus being absent from their lives; however OP is also an AH for mandating supervised visits without a court order or any legal custody agreement.\n\nESH", "It's sounds like no legal custody agreement was decided, which means she does not have that right"]}
