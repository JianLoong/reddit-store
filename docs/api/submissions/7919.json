{"id": 7919, "submission_id": "10htez7", "title": "AITA for telling my sister I'm done taking care of her dog?", "selftext": "So about a week before Thanksgiving, my sister (19F) adopted a two year old rescue dog. Everyone in the family was excited, apart from me (21F) since I didn't want the responsibility of caring for a dog on top of the 2 cats I already have. I made it very clear I did not have time or energy for the dog, and my sister reassured me multiple times that she would be the sole care taker, that she was \"ready\" for this. We have now had the dog for almost 2 months.\n\nThis morning my sister and I got in an argument while she was getting ready to go out with her boyfriend. I told her I didn't want to be left watching the dog all weekend again since she had just went out the last two weekends with her bf. She told me that this was the last time since he will be out of town for school. I got really frustrated at that and mentioned how she does it with her friends too. She then snapped back at me saying, \"Well you only go to work and out once in a blue moon so how hard is it to watch her sit around for a couple hours?\" \n\nAnd that was what really frustrated me. I mentioned how I specifically told her before she got the dog that I did not want any responsibility, yet I give her daily walks, take her out for potty, teach her the rights and wrongs of the house, because my sister is never present to do so, and when she is, she calls the dog a \"lazy\" one who likes to just sleep all day, which is far from true but she hasn't taken much time to really get to know the dog. The dog loves being outdoors, but my sister prefers to watch tv with her since she isn't an \"outdoor person\". \n\nMy sister then told me \"well fine, if you don't want to watch her, she will just have to get crated\". But if she got crated, then I would just have to hear barking all day since the dog has crate trauma. Either way it feels like a lose/lose, either I care for the dog, or I listen to the dog cry nonstop.\n\nI gave in again telling her that she doesn't need to crate her, but she needs to start taking responsibility. She said \"I'm going to be real busy with work and school, but I'll try.\"\nTo which I replied, \"Okay well maybe if you're too busy for a dog you shouldn't have gotten one.\"\nShe ignored me then left for her day with her bf.\n\n\nSo AITA for telling her that I'm fed up with the responsibility of taking care of her dog? I'm only taking care of it since it wouldn't be fair to the dog, but every time I ask her to do something for the dog, she ends up arguing with me over it and it's getting pretty exhausting.\n\nEDIT: I do also want to mention, my sister does love the dog, she wouldn't ever intentionally harm it, she just has a tendency to be immature and irresponsible, which is why she lacks understanding and care for what a pet fully requires.", "created_utc": 1674314072, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10htez7/aita_for_telling_my_sister_im_done_taking_care_of/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They might take her back and find a better placement.", "NTA\n\nSo why did your sister get a dog if she didn't want the responsibility of owning one? Where did she get the dog? Some places will take an animal back if it's not working out, might want to check.", "Is there anyway you can beat her to the punch and go away for the weekend?", "NTA - Sister IS intentionally harming the dog.  Don't be fooled.  The poor animal should be rehomed to someone who wants more than an *accessory*.", "NTA tell your sister that she is abusing your dog", "We both are still living at home, so in total there are four of us in the house, but the one man in the house, the dog is terrified of so she won't go near him (she has an issue with older men we learned). The other is our grandmother, but she works full time and is rarely home until later evening. The dog only listens and trusts my sister and I, which is why her using crating as a threat just breaks my heart since one out of the two people she really trusts never seems to want to do things with her. Pets shouldn't be accessories, and gosh it is just frustrating :(", "that is honestly a great idea, thank you. I haven't come up with anything I could really use against her to maybe knock some sense into her head. At her core, she really is an amazing person and I love her to death, but she is so ignorant when it comes to caring for animals", "I will definitely try having a calm conversation with her, but she always jumps to defense as if I'm attacking her, hence why so many arguments have come up. But I feel if I mention the impact on the dogs life too apart from just mine, maybe it can help open her eyes", "I seriously doubt a conversation with  19yr old acting this way will make a bit of difference. \nNTA  but sis definitely is & poor dog needs a new home where it is loved.", "Thank you for mentioning boundaries. I've let her push mine so much with this, it is about time I stood my ground. Like you said, the only reason I haven't is cause I don't want the poor dog to suffer, but at the same time, it isn't even my dog \ud83d\ude05 I will definitely get my other family members involved in the conversation though and hopefully they can also give her much needed insight", "During the week she's gone about 8-10 hours a day, then on her weekends, if she is with her boyfriend she usually spends the whole day with him, but if its her friends it's usually 4-6 hours. I work evening/nights so I'm gone when she eventually gets home.", "I do need to grow a back bone when it comes to her. I hate to see the dog be lonely, but you're right. Its due time I back off, people need to own their shit, and I dunno why I let my sister be an exception for that. Thank you for giving me a bit of an eye opener there", "Exactly, I know the dog requires so much more than what I can offer right now which is exactly why I didn't want one of my own. The dog is only two also, so shes still got a lot of energy. Sure I'm capable of taking care of my kitties, and one of which is a pretty active cat but my plate was already full. End of the day, my energy is 101% drained. Thank you for the paraphrase, I'm definitely going to pocket that for my next conversation with her.", "I was the odd one out of the household who didn't want a new dog, everyone else was all for it. When we first got the cats, one was supposed to be hers, but both cats chose me as their person and once she realized the cats would rather lay with me than her, she lost interest in really interacting with them apart from saying hello with a few pets. She was really only allowed to get the dog because she had a huge breakdown over how much she wanted a pet of her own and how \"ready\" she was for it, and the other family members love dogs so they didn't mind the presence of one as long as she took care of it", "My sister is home over night usually so the dog will sleep with her, but in the morning when she leaves, the dog comes to my bed till I get up", "I'm currently looking into getting ahold of someone from there to talk with about the situation. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt though and try having one last talk as a whole family before making any hasty decisions on my own but if that is what it comes down to, then I won't hesitate", "honestly I've been wondering the same. She said she was \"ready,\" and knew what caring for a dog meant, but she is proving to do quite the opposite. She found the dog on social media about to be put down if not taken in 48 hours. She reached out because it was near us and then it all went from there", "Gosh I wish there was, but I always work Sat. However, you just gave me an idea to try for Sunday! thank you! Looks like I'll be enjoying the day in the city tomorrow haha", "The best thing to do here would be to just rehome the thing or surrender it to the shelter, but it doesn't sound like your sister is going to be happy about that idea.\n\nWhat's left to do?\n\n1. you could just eviscerate her on social media which will probably solve the dog problem but then you'll have a sister/family problem forever\n2. you could surrender the dog without her knowledge (which is likely illegal depending on your location since it's theft)\n3. you could call animal protective services and just say \"hey uh what do i do this sucks a lot\" and see what happens, but that sounds an awful lot like calling the cops which is always a bad idea", "Talk to your sister for sure and Calling the rescue is the best plan. Do not call animal control or the shelter. You sister loved being a rescue hero and didn\u2019t think of the consequences for the poor pooch.\n Good luck you sound like a nice person.", "It's time to call the rescue and let them know the situation.  It's not fair to you or the dog. Your sister can suck it.", "When I had roommates - I left my dog at home when I went out or worked (like any other dog owner).  She was not in a crate however I know the length of time I could leave my dog in the house without needing to go out etc.  \n\nI never expected or asked my roommates to l let my dog out. \n\nI guess what I am asking does the dog require to be let out really frequently?   I understand if it were overnight but is your sister asking you to anything with the dog when she leaves?", "No problem at all and it's okay. I'm an older sister and my little sister gets away with murder when it comes to me. But there does come a time when you need to just let go and let them succeed or fail.  It's really hard since it's an innocent animal involved and honestly, the dog did nothing. \n\nIf you think the dog is being so neglected it's a danger then intervene but if it's anything less then let her deal with it. She needs to realize you're not her staff. She made a commitment to this animal. There is no 'i don't feel like it' that is not an option. \n\nGood luck. I really hope it all works out. Stay strong.", "without being to probing what breed did she get as some breeds need ALOT more work than others as well so the level of care could be even higher people here are expecting \n\n&#x200B;\n\ni have a dachshund which despite being a \"small\" dog it comes from hunting stock  and he came from an active hunting line and it shows. i can walk him until i cant stand anymore and he could happily go for the same walk again as long as there is something to snuffle and hunt for.", "Pets are a huge responsibility and she shouldn\u2019t have given up on the cats. What if the dog chooses someone else? Seems like she wants a pet to replace something, rather than actually wanting a dog or cat.\n\nHowever, what concerns me the most is that a) you either perceive it as you only caring for the dog and cats, or b) you actually are the only one caring. Neither options are good. Where is everyone else who was opting for the dog?", "I've thought about rehoming her, but she is legally under my sisters name, and I believe it was like a $2K fee from the rescue she got her at if you end up not being able to care for the dog. I will keep this in mind though if things don't look up after this", "Thank you for saying this. As much as I'd love to just go \"yea screw you!!\", I know deep down she does love the dog, she just isn't equip right now (or possibly ever idk lol) for one. I will try having a serious conversation with her and our family, and resort to calling the rescue if need be after", "The dog doesn't really have a set potty schedule (I let her out usually two or three times during the morning/afternoon), and she also doesn't give any warning signs that she may have to go. My sister doesn't ask me to do anything in particular apart from watch her, but watching her has included, food when she is hungry, fresh water, her potty breaks, play time (she brings me her toys), and walks. The reason I have taken that on is because I know when my sister gets home she won't check the water dishes, she won't clean any of the dogs poops from the week, and she won't take the dog out on walks. I think she maybe took her on either 2 or 3 walks total since we got her. I didn't think it was fair to the dog to just blatantly ignore her when I could do those things for her, I just don't want to have to do those things", "Little sisters, you love em but man they sure know exactly what buttons to press. But yes, thats exactly why it's been such a dilemma for me, the poor pup hasn't done anything wrong. I don't think the dog would ever be put at the point of danger, I know my sister would never willingly harm any animal, she just doesn't want the work that comes with an animal. She wants to give pets, cuddle and watch movies with the dog, and while that is okay, only using the dog for those reasons isn't. I think these next few days I'll kind of just stop and step back and see if she picks up any slack. Thank you again, I will hopefully have a positive update soon", "I did think that maybe I was perceiving things the wrong way, but once our one cat had a bladder blockage emergency I've really gotten to see how nonchalant my family is with caring for the pets. None of them take his condition seriously (ex. he is on a STRICT prescription food diet, so why did I find chunks of real meat in his food and was told \"it was only a little treat\" after I specifically told everyone he can't have any other food). My sister never was a huge animal person like myself, but it definitely seems like either yeah she was using the dog to replace another pet, or using it as a way to prove herself for some unknown reason. The dog is terrified of older men so the man in the house has given up trying to work with her (ie. well the dog doesnt like me so I don't like it. Hes a bit of a hardhead.). And the other person in the house is alwaus either working or out and about (no time for the dog). Hence why we all said she can as long as she cares for it but unfortunately that isnt how things have been :/", "> $2K fee from the rescue she got her at if you end up not being able to care for the dog\n\nWait, this is your lifeline if you need it. That rescue and the people that work there deeply care about that dog. \n\nThreatening your sister with telling the rescue or whatever isn't going to help, but they will take her back if they are a \"real rescue\" (using quotes here to not get into a semantic argument).\n\nTelling your sister that the $2k fee is specifically to make sure that people that treat their dogs the way she is treating her dog do not adopt might help. If you go this route, do not say \"people like you\" or whatever or she will go on the defensive, just say \"people who act like how you are acting\".", "I would verify this. A lot of shelters have more flexible policies.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through that. Pets are a major responsibility and people often want the \u201cfun part\u201d of it. I do not think you\u2019re TA in this situation and your sister should have thought twice about RESCUING a dog. These dogs already (usually) come from less than ideal situations, so her leaving often can cause these types of dogs to have even more issues. Everyone in the household needs to sit down and talk, but it sounds like nobody would take it seriously. Save up for your own place, it\u2019s probably the only realistic solution to getting out of dog-sitting. That being said, I appreciate the fact that you\u2019re not neglecting the dog even if you didn\u2019t want it.\n\nEdit: I may be biased due to owning a fear-type rescue dog. I am lucky she doesn\u2019t have separation anxiety, but she is a LOT of work.", "Thank you for bringing this up! I will definitely try getting ahold of them and seeing what their specific policies are. I wasn't too sure on all the fine details since she had done all the paperwork and whatnot with them for the dog, but I will do more research on their mission and see if we could work something out", "Thank you, I really appreciate your feedback. I knew rescue dogs take extra time and work, especially since like you said, her situation before us was not ideal at all. Poor thing was always locked up alone outside, which is why I think she has crate trauma. I've been in the works of getting my own place, but when my kitty had his emergency, those vet bills put me back. Hopefully soon I'll be on my own though. And of course, I work with animals so any time I can give them proper care, that is what I strive to do. But thats why I work with them, so I don't have responsibility of owning them myself \ud83d\ude05", "Part of what she signed might require that she allow the rescue's employees access to the dog to make sure everything is fine (my sibling's dog had this stipulation for the first couple years but they never got a visit).", "I remember she mentioned something about them possibly doing a home visit, but I haven't heard anything thus far if they were going to actually come or not", "NTA, stop coddling your sister. She does this because she knows you'll take care of the dog. When she says she has plans, leave the house even if your just sitting in the grocery store parking lot.", "If your sister threatens to crate a dog that she knows has crate trauma, she most certainly does NOT love the dog. A pet is a lifetime commitment, and when you rescue a pet you need to do everything you can to give it the best life possible, which includes trying to undo past trauma it may have experienced. Threatening to put it right back into a bad situation when it's not convenient to her is neglect. The very LAST thing I'd do would be calling animal protective services or surrender the dog to a shelter. Depending on what kind of shelter it is, that can be like putting the pet on death row. \n\nIf at all possible, try to find a good, loving home for the dog. Your sister definitely isn't ready for the commitment of a pet, and the dog deserves better than that. Work with local rescue groups to see if somebody can foster the dog until someone can give it a good home. You are NTA but your sister most certainly is.", "NTA. I got a puppy at 19. I still lived with my parents as well. That dog went with me almost everywhere because my parents told me she was my responsibility. I did the walks, food, training, etc. I was also in college and working. So she is full of it. I'm sorry you're stuck with a sister who won't take responsibility for her pet.", "NTA, but it sounds like you need to move.", "NTA.  If OP is in the USA, call the local office of the ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals).  They should be able to help and at least offer some good advice.", "Definitely on my to do list. From here on out any plans she has, I suddenly got stuff coming up too lol. I know I need to stop catering to her, it'll be much easier when I'm finally on my own", "Something like that would also be useful if you're going to contact the rescue group.", "It's a black lab, which I know are hunting/fishing dogs. We grew up with labs as family dogs, but they were hunters and would go out in fields or lakes almost daily. She definitely has the energy of a lab alright. She is the same with her walks. I take her for an hour and 45 minutes and we get home, she drinks and is looking at the door to go again. I tell my sister, \"make sure you walk her\" and there's always an excuse. I know she needs to exercise, but again, I don't have the time every day for her. Wish we had a fenced in yard for her to run, but sadly our property line can't have one :/"]}
