Well, it doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal to wear a dress for just a few hours when you can wear pants whenever you want afterwards, and besides, there are cultures where other women are forced to dress even more modestly. \u201cYou love your grandparents, right? Can\u2019t you give in a little bit for their sake? What\u2019s the big issue?\u201d\n\nFirst off, don\u2019t even think about bringing other cultures into this, because \u2014 who cares? That\u2019s not your culture.

This includes things as \u201cminor\u201d as clothing choices. Especially in this day and age of \u201cmy body my rights\u201d plastered everywhere on social media, having someone tell them how to dress screams \u201cyou can\u2019t think for yourself\u201d and \u201cyour feelings don\u2019t matter\u201d, which are huge no-no\u2019s for girls that age.\n\nI know you\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to appease your in-laws and your daughters, but consider the following:\n\n1. Why is your oldest planning to never speak to her grandparents again as soon as she\u2019s 18? That seems like an extreme reaction for just the issue of dresses vs. pants, and hints at other possible problems. Is it just the dress issue, or are there other \u201cold-fashioned\u201d views of your in-laws that are so grating on your daughter that she feels like it\u2019s a toxic environment she needs to escape from ASAP? I suggest talking to your daughter one-on-one and really, truly listening to how she feels and why she thinks that way. I\u2019ve had these kinds of conversations with my own mother and it helped a lot in resolving our differences \u2014 sometimes I would give in after my mother would explain her conservative reasoning, while other times my mother would acknowledge my feelings and arrange things so that I wouldn\u2019t be hurt. Either way, don\u2019t try to \u201cwin the argument\u201d during this talk or belittle your daughter\u2019s feelings \u2014 no matter how minor the issue may seem, the hurt that she feels is at the very least very real. Just having someone listen to and validate your feelings can help. (Also, check in with your 14 y.o. as well!)\n\n2. Would it really be the end of the world if your daughters wore pants in front of your in-laws? While I understand the need to respect elders, they in turn need to understand the world has changed, like it or not.

Maybe a compromise like pants-okay for casual visits, but dresses-only for more formal visits like Thanksgiving and Christmas?\n\n3. Whatever the outcome of the talk in #2 is, share it with your daughters and again, try to reach a compromise. \u201cI know you hate dresses, so we\u2019ve decided you only have to wear them on Thanksgiving. Would that be okay?\u201d Or if your in-laws are stubbornly against pants, explain that fact to your daughters and discuss their choices and the pros and cons of what would happen (e.g. They can wear pants, but they\u2019ll get chewed out by their grandparents and if that\u2019s what they really want, then they should prepare for it; or they can wear dresses and be uncomfortable, but at least their grandparents won\u2019t say anything and hey, maybe we can go for ice cream after).

You're prioritizing people who believe that your daughters are only as important as their ability to submissively please other people with their femininity and appearance. \n\nIf that sounds like a gross exaggeration that can't be true (\"no, grandma and grandpa care about them more than that!\") then surely gma and gpa would eventually be able to accept them in pants, no? \n\nIf not, then you already have your answer.
