Well, it doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal to wear a dress for just a few hours when you can wear pants whenever you want afterwards, and besides, there are cultures where other women are forced to dress even more modestly. \u201cYou love your grandparents, right? Can\u2019t you give in a little bit for their sake? What\u2019s the big issue?\u201d\n\nFirst off, don\u2019t even think about bringing other cultures into this, because \u2014 who cares?

This includes things as \u201cminor\u201d as clothing choices. Especially in this day and age of \u201cmy body my rights\u201d plastered everywhere on social media, having someone tell them how to dress screams \u201cyou can\u2019t think for yourself\u201d and \u201cyour feelings don\u2019t matter\u201d, which are huge no-no\u2019s for girls that age.\n\nI know you\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to appease your in-laws and your daughters, but consider the following:\n\n1. Why is your oldest planning to never speak to her grandparents again as soon as she\u2019s 18? That seems like an extreme reaction for just the issue of dresses vs. pants, and hints at other possible problems. Is it just the dress issue, or are there other \u201cold-fashioned\u201d views of your in-laws that are so grating on your daughter that she feels like it\u2019s a toxic environment she needs to escape from ASAP? I suggest talking to your daughter one-on-one and really, truly listening to how she feels and why she thinks that way. I\u2019ve had these kinds of conversations with my own mother and it helped a lot in resolving our differences \u2014 sometimes I would give in after my mother would explain her conservative reasoning, while other times my mother would acknowledge my feelings and arrange things so that I wouldn\u2019t be hurt. Either way, don\u2019t try to \u201cwin the argument\u201d during this talk or belittle your daughter\u2019s feelings \u2014 no matter how minor the issue may seem, the hurt that she feels is at the very least very real. Just having someone listen to and validate your feelings can help. (Also, check in with your 14 y.o. as well!)\n\n2. Would it really be the end of the world if your daughters wore pants in front of your in-laws?

Maybe a compromise like pants-okay for casual visits, but dresses-only for more formal visits like Thanksgiving and Christmas?\n\n3. Whatever the outcome of the talk in #2 is, share it with your daughters and again, try to reach a compromise. \u201cI know you hate dresses, so we\u2019ve decided you only have to wear them on Thanksgiving. Would that be okay?\u201d Or if your in-laws are stubbornly against pants, explain that fact to your daughters and discuss their choices and the pros and cons of what would happen (e.g. They can wear pants, but they\u2019ll get chewed out by their grandparents and if that\u2019s what they really want, then they should prepare for it; or they can wear dresses and be uncomfortable, but at least their grandparents won\u2019t say anything and hey, maybe we can go for ice cream after).

YTA", "Right, like twice a year, Not that it\u2019s right or wrong but my family would turn it into a running joke and it\u2019d be a funny albeit borderline traumatic memory but we\u2019d talk smack how crazy our grandparents were\u2026 Multiple times a week like they\u2019re regularly in each other\u2019s lives is a no-go and ridiculous.", "Yeah, that blew me away.\n\nI disagree totally with doing this, but doing it 2-3 times a year is completely different than doing it multiple times per week!\n\nI'm going to guess if OP and Hubby had laid it out from the start that this wouldn't be tolerated, the grandparents would be well over it by now. Now its going to be a much bigger thing than it would have been if they'd just responded with \"the girls are allowed to wear whatever makes them comfortable, and if you continue to complain we just won't be bringing them any more\" when this first became an issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The issue is our oldest is planning to never speak to her grandparents again after she's 18, and I'm worried it's affecting them.\n\nOP, I'd be worried about how its going to affect your relationship with them more if I was you.

OP said \"a few times a week\"! That's kind of a lot to deal with, actually.\n\nYeah, this felt pretty reasonable up until that. \"Every once in a while you might have to do something uncomfortable to make someone you care about happy, even if the thing they're happy about feels stupid to you - we do this because we care about our loved ones\" is a fine lesson to learn. \"You need to put up with other people's irrationality on a regular basis because we said so\" is a much worse lesson.", "My mom-mom was born in 1917, and was very religious.   She wore pants every day.  Even to church.", "My MIL was born in 1931 and scandalized her Kentucky home town by not only wearing pants, but saying no to her first suitor because he didn\u2019t believe in birth control. She eventually met the man who would become her husband and he whisked her out to California shortly after my husband was born in the early 50\u2019s. They never looked back. \n\nIt\u2019s not about age. It\u2019s about misogyny.

Her mother never wore pants, but my mom wore jeans in the 40s and 50s before it was cool to do so and I think I remember 3 or 4 times when she wore a skirt. I'm sure my religious grandmother didn't like my mom wearing pants all the time, and my sister and I weren't dress wearers except that we were required to in school, but I also don't remember my grandmother ever saying a word about it.

You are taking the easy way by forcing them, but look what they're doing to your kids already with one of them saying she wants nothing to do with them the minute she's not required to.", "My grandmom was born in 1935.

This is downright torture at this point. Your daughters deserve better.

I thought we were talking about a couple of special occasions, not several hours several days a week. \n\nLeave your daughters at home instead.

Not the one who says it\u2019s ok to let someone else make choices for you. That\u2019s a crap lesson and a slippery slope. \n\nMaybe next time all 3 kids should wear dresses.
