I also make enough for the college aged kids to have left overs. \n\nI usually make 3 turkeys, 2 party pans of mac and cheese and a party pan of mashed potatoes, stuffing, green bean casserole, collard greens, yams, mini seafood quiches, stuffed mushrooms, rolls and a salad from scratch. \n\nPlus all the desserts apple pie, sweet potato pie, cheesecake,  homemade ice cream and \nbreads also from scratch. \n\nI start making stocks and doughs Tuesday night. I bake my bread for stuffing and make my cheesecake and pies Wednesday after work. Cook all day Thursday so we can sit down and start eating at by 4 so my aunts who work the nights shift as nurses can enjoy. \n\nEvery year people invite unexpected guest and it becomes 30+. I would be ok if it were plus ones but my mom invites her friends and their kids. \n\nMy mom and aunt ask me to make additional turkeys and some sides for their units. I never feel appreciated for everything I do to make it special and accommodate everyone. \n\nThis year I\u2019m separated from my husband and I really don\u2019t feel like bending over backwards cooking for people who don\u2019t even leave me left overs to make a sandwich the next day. \n\nThis year I\u2019ve decided not to cook and just spend my day at the beach, the only bonus to living in. Florida. \n\nI was asked how much the adults should Zelle me for thanksgiving groceries at the beginning of the month and I told them I\u2019m not cooking. Today I received a zelle from my uncle and when I returned it he asked why, I reminded him and the family group chat I wasn\u2019t cooking. \n\nNow they want me to cancel my plans and cook.

You have done enough.", "You know, that economist who wrote *Predictably Irrational* (Dan Ariely) talked about how differently we behave with money markets verses social markets.\n\nYou help your friend move, the expectation is that if you need help moving, your friend helps you (or an equivalent favor).  That's our \"social market,\" based on favors and friendship.  We don't keep direct score, but we sure do notice if someone starts to take advantage of us.\n\nThe money market is different and works on pure exchange of $$ for service or goods.  Someone you don't know well asks you to help move and offers you $20 or $30 an hour for the day of helping.  No favor is given, no favor is expected in return--it's a pure transaction for $$. \n\nWhat's interesting is that if the money and social markets collide, the money market takes over.  There was a daycare that had a problem with parents picking kids up late, so they started charging a fee every minute that parents were late.  But that turned a basic social transaction (please don't be late picking up your kid, it's rude and people have to stay later) into a money transaction ($$ every minute you're late).  Parents started picking up their kids LATER.  Parents who had never picked up their kids late now thought \"Cool, I can afford this fee, and I need the time more than the money!\"\n\nWhen the OP wrote that the family Zelled her cash for Thanksgiving, it makes perfect sense that they wouldn't leave her any leftovers and basically wouldn't treat her like family!  It's left the realm of social markets and entered the realm of money.  Now OP is not a family member.\n\nShe's an employee.\n\nYeah, I know they were just covering the cost of groceries, but it *feels* like they're paying for Thanksgiving dinner and OP provides Thanksgiving dinner.  Fee for services rendered.  Want more people at Thanksgiving?  Just throw extra $$ at the hired help.  Should be fine.  Why not take the leftovers?  You paid for 'em.\n\nSo OP is of course NTA for not wanting to cook Thanksgiving dinner (although it's getting a LITTLE LATE for big group plans to change like this)... but it's also time for a  Thanksgiving reset so that she isn't feeling like an employee.  Next year, no more Zelling, back to potluck, maybe make the turkey.  Money does not change hands, because OP is family, not a caterer.", ">who don\u2019t even leave me left overs to make a sandwich the next day.\n\nAmen.

We are now 1 week (to the day) before Thanksgiving, which is not enough time to pick a new person to host, let alone for that person to plan and cook a banquet for 30+ people (which OP said includes cooking 3 turkeys, a dozen side dishes, and five desserts), let alone if anyone needs to change flights and hotels.

Take both of those things into account and it's perfectly reasonable for your family to expect you to cook on Thanksgiving.\n\nHaving said that, you are absolutely entitled to taking a year off or changing up the schedule moving forward so you are not in charge of Thanksgiving. Especially considering your circumstances. Thus NAH.\n\nHowever, the one variable here is when you notified your family you wouldn't be cooking. If it's a recent thing and you only told them a week (or even two) before the day ... that's not exactly much notice to decide where to host it, plan a menu, shop for it, make sure they have all the peripheral things needed to pull it off, etc. Often times it's multiple years of improvements that makes Thanksgiving go off without issue so going 0 to 60 with no time to plan is asking a lot. That's the only part that would make me lean toward Y T A. Even then it would be NAH but tilted toward Y T A :).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That was the last straw for me. That July 4th we started getting messages about our 'awesome party' - just some info on the party - we paid for and cooked the food from mini quiches, spanakopita, steaks, salads, desserts, we paid for the fireworks - enough that we had 20 minute non stop shows, we paid for all the pool toys, had towels and games, liquor, etc. plus hats, etc... We said no party that year. no one invited us to theirs. It has been 6 years and we just have us at home or go out to eat and even if someone invites us now after all this time we just say we have plans.
