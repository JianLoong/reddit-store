I bake my bread for stuffing and make my cheesecake and pies Wednesday after work. Cook all day Thursday so we can sit down and start eating at by 4 so my aunts who work the nights shift as nurses can enjoy. \n\nEvery year people invite unexpected guest and it becomes 30+. I would be ok if it were plus ones but my mom invites her friends and their kids. \n\nMy mom and aunt ask me to make additional turkeys and some sides for their units. I never feel appreciated for everything I do to make it special and accommodate everyone. \n\nThis year I\u2019m separated from my husband and I really don\u2019t feel like bending over backwards cooking for people who don\u2019t even leave me left overs to make a sandwich the next day. \n\nThis year I\u2019ve decided not to cook and just spend my day at the beach, the only bonus to living in. Florida. \n\nI was asked how much the adults should Zelle me for thanksgiving groceries at the beginning of the month and I told them I\u2019m not cooking. Today I received a zelle from my uncle and when I returned it he asked why, I reminded him and the family group chat I wasn\u2019t cooking. \n\nNow they want me to cancel my plans and cook.

You have done enough.", "You know, that economist who wrote *Predictably Irrational* (Dan Ariely) talked about how differently we behave with money markets verses social markets.\n\nYou help your friend move, the expectation is that if you need help moving, your friend helps you (or an equivalent favor).  That's our \"social market,\" based on favors and friendship.  We don't keep direct score, but we sure do notice if someone starts to take advantage of us.\n\nThe money market is different and works on pure exchange of $$ for service or goods.  Someone you don't know well asks you to help move and offers you $20 or $30 an hour for the day of helping.  No favor is given, no favor is expected in return--it's a pure transaction for $$. \n\nWhat's interesting is that if the money and social markets collide, the money market takes over.  There was a daycare that had a problem with parents picking kids up late, so they started charging a fee every minute that parents were late.  But that turned a basic social transaction (please don't be late picking up your kid, it's rude and people have to stay later) into a money transaction ($$ every minute you're late).  Parents started picking up their kids LATER.  Parents who had never picked up their kids late now thought \"Cool, I can afford this fee, and I need the time more than the money!\"\n\nWhen the OP wrote that the family Zelled her cash for Thanksgiving, it makes perfect sense that they wouldn't leave her any leftovers and basically wouldn't treat her like family!  It's left the realm of social markets and entered the realm of money.  Now OP is not a family member.\n\nShe's an employee.\n\nYeah, I know they were just covering the cost of groceries, but it *feels* like they're paying for Thanksgiving dinner and OP provides Thanksgiving dinner.  Fee for services rendered.  Want more people at Thanksgiving?  Just throw extra $$ at the hired help.  Should be fine.  Why not take the leftovers?  You paid for 'em.\n\nSo OP is of course NTA for not wanting to cook Thanksgiving dinner (although it's getting a LITTLE LATE for big group plans to change like this)... but it's also time for a  Thanksgiving reset so that she isn't feeling like an employee.  Next year, no more Zelling, back to potluck, maybe make the turkey.  Money does not change hands, because OP is family, not a caterer.", ">who don\u2019t even leave me left overs to make a sandwich the next day.\n\nAmen.

We are now 1 week (to the day) before Thanksgiving, which is not enough time to pick a new person to host, let alone for that person to plan and cook a banquet for 30+ people (which OP said includes cooking 3 turkeys, a dozen side dishes, and five desserts), let alone if anyone needs to change flights and hotels.

Take both of those things into account and it's perfectly reasonable for your family to expect you to cook on Thanksgiving.\n\nHaving said that, you are absolutely entitled to taking a year off or changing up the schedule moving forward so you are not in charge of Thanksgiving. Especially considering your circumstances. Thus NAH.\n\nHowever, the one variable here is when you notified your family you wouldn't be cooking. If it's a recent thing and you only told them a week (or even two) before the day ... that's not exactly much notice to decide where to host it, plan a menu, shop for it, make sure they have all the peripheral things needed to pull it off, etc. Often times it's multiple years of improvements that makes Thanksgiving go off without issue so going 0 to 60 with no time to plan is asking a lot. That's the only part that would make me lean toward Y T A. Even then it would be NAH but tilted toward Y T A :).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We figured out when I was still a teen that everything is easier if 1) we cook enough for leftovers BUT we *always potluck* and 2) everyone helps clean up at the end of the night. And by that last part, I mean seriously. We mostly used paper plates pre covid, but of course there were still platters and such. We rotate the house that hosts as well, but we don\u2019t leave without everyone packing up their leftovers (usually in one of the pans/containers they used to bring their contribution in), making sure disposable plates, utensils, cups, cans, bottles etc are in garbage bags or the recycling bin as appropriate. The reusable dishes/pans are washed and left to dry or loaded into the dishwasher. Food is in the fridge or bagged/boxed up and loaded into cars. Furniture is put back, tables/counters wiped down, kitchens/dining rooms are swept. \n\nI didn\u2019t realize until I was a teenager how lucky I was to have a family who did things this way. I remember the few years when everyone started moving into their own homes and we didn\u2019t have this system and it was EXHAUSTING to be the hosting house, even when I was one of the kids. It only took a couple of rotations and one person to say \u201cok guys, help me clean up\u201d before we got to the new system. Potluck dinner is how a lot of my generation learned how to cook for others, and how to be decent hosts *and* decent guests. And with that many people, it\u2019s not nearly as arduous to help clean up, especially since you\u2019re still partying. I mean, most of the time, the music and talking and joking is still going on so it\u2019s not some horrible prison sentence.\n\n(We started with our culture\u2019s foods, but these days it\u2019s mostly American food.

So much for 'family', yikes.", "The bot doesn't count votes it just grabs the top post that has a vote.", "First, you are NTA. You gave your family plenty of time by stating your intentions early so that they could make other plans.\n\nSecond, take care of yourself.  It sounds like you really need this break.  You are not doing anything wrong by healing your hurts and putting yourself first right now.", "Just have them veto you the amount and order Marie calandras next year. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "So that's a little useful info for your post. They're stealing your time, but at least paying you back for the food.\n\nYou are NTA. You don't have to cook for them.  They're acting like leeches.", "You are very sweet. Thank you for sharing that with me! I hope you realize how much of a badass of a cook you are. If you want to cook for Thanksgiving still next year, maybe hit up the food bank and do some cooking that will be APPRECIATED.", "Oh I have brined turkey down to a science. It's delicious. It's just effort and stress and anxiety. Everyone always loves everything and they're super grateful but I have nightmares about my food tasting terrible.", "I understand that.  I wish your family did.", "It sounds like you\u2019re high maintenance and shut everyone out of helping w the holiday, then got them to rely on you, then bailed. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to make food at that scale. Have 2 families bring sweet potato casserole. And 2 being green beans. And 3 bring stuffing. Or whatever. Maybe everyone doesn\u2019t get everything but who cares.", "Sounds like Sunderella found her other glass slipper! Please, give us an update after Thanksresting!", "Sounds like in addition to taking a break at least this year, you need to set some boundaries with your mom.", "Join me at the beach", "It\u2019s in there that they Zelle me", "A dinner this size should be a potluck with everyone making an assigned dish and bringing it.  I don't say this to be mean, but your comments make it sound like you brought this burden on yourself.   You are NTA for not wanting to cook for 30 people!  That's ridiculous.", "OP - there\u2019s a REALLY great book called \u201cReal Self Care\u201d that I think would really help you, because it is full of stories very like yours. It is about finding your values and setting limits, especially with families that traditionally have expected women to be selfless caretakers. It has helped me a lot. \nEnjoy your beach day. Best wishes!", "I'd love some spicy beef patties for thanksgiving", "He was such a wise man. Thinking so beyond his time", "breaking even is not getting paid", "She\u2019s not getting paid for the hours spent planning, grocery shopping, and cooking it. She is only reimbursed for the cost of groceries themselves. Why would it be unreasonable to pay the only chef for all the time they spent cooking for 30+ people, many of whom aren\u2019t even family but just friends of family who come as a surprise?\n\nAt a certain point her family is just making her a caterer for their extended family and friends, without the consent of OP herself. And as such, she should be compensated. And should at least have enough for some leftovers.", "Time to get awkward, if she does it again.\n\n\"Mom.  That's the food I set aside for my own breakfast.  My name is on it.  If I want to give it away I will give it away.  Neighbor, if you would like to come to Thanksgiving next year, just let me know by July.\"", "Oh I did. When I first started it was just family and I that was 15 people now after a few marriages it\u2019s 20 base that\u2019s without the 3 leaving to work the night shift at hospitals. \n\nI genuinely enjoy it but with the stress of my separation I mentally do not have the fortitude to do it. A regular dinner for myself is hard enough to put together.", "We eat black eyed peas, collard greens and sometimes sauerkraut for New Year's. My mother added the sauerkraut because she read it was lucky to eat it.", "With cocoa bread", "Hon, take a break!  Fix yourself some foochie bread, roast up half a turkey or a nice fat Cornish hen, make just enough Havarti toast for one and a mini mac 'n' cheese, and do some cranberry sauce & gravy.  Make exactly what you like and eat on it for a couple days.", "That sounds fantastic!", "If that\u2019s true, then breaking even isn\u2019t \u201cfree\u201d either", "She did it during my nap that sneaky MF", "My mom got too old and finally let me and my SILs help, but then there was a divorce and the other SIL was unreliable,  so my mom and I just pay for catering now.  My husband did all the cleaning before and after when it was at our house, but it was just too exhausting. \n\nI'm sorry about your separation.  That's a tough thing to go through and I hope your vacation helps.", "Please don\u2019t cave under pressure. Stick to your plan. You need it, and they need to step up and take care of things themselves for a change.", "That's me this year. I'm going to eat a pot of garlic mashed potatoes and watch football. I'm EXCITED.", "correct, ever heard the phrase \"time is money\"?", "That first sentence made me laugh out loud.  You are NTA, let someone else do the work.", "This year u decided all I really want is sides. So making myself stuffing, mashed potatoes & gravy, green bean casserole, & corn mac & cheese. Gonna carb load then lay on the couch & watch football. Just me & my two cats. It will be perfect.", "Dude that sounds *awesome*"]}
