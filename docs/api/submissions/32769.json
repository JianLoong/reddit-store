My kids are 13 M and 10F.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, my parents were traveling in Mexico and rescued a dog they met on the streets.  They took him to a local shelter and approximately 6 months later, went back and picked him and another dog up. They took them back to their home in the USA.\nWhile this was happening,  the narrative my parents were telling family, is that they were just transporting these dogs to their forever families. \nMy parents were not working with a local shelter and have no rescue experience. I shared my apprehension and asked what would happen if a family fell through? They said they were very sure of the families selected and they had other homes lined up.\nWell, it has been 2 years and guess who hasn't found homes? The street dogs. The one dog that my parents personally rescued has since BIT EACH OF MY PARENTS.  One time landed my dad in the emergency room.\nSince this has happened,  I have refused to have my kids around these dogs. Both of my children have special needs (autism) and will eventually need to have a service animal. \nI have asked my parents to put the dogs in their detached garage for the 2 hours my kids would be in the home for Christmas.\n My kids are used to having full access to their grandparents entire house (this was encouraged by my mom) and don't understand why they can't go into certain rooms or open the back door. They had meltdowns prior when my husband and I followed them (our kiddos) around to ensure their safety at a prior family event. At one point my husband lost sight of our oldest and we had a moment of panic. Due to this experience,  we said the dog needs to be out of the home for the kids to visit ( be a doggy daycare, a friend's home or their heated detached garage). \nThe response I got from my mom \" This is the dogs home... and they will not be put in the garage or taken anywhere.\"\nI am now being called the AH because we won't go to my parents house for Christmas.

Problem solved.", "Sorry, YTA. Your parents do separate the dogs when you come over. But *your* kids have meltdowns if they aren't allowed everywhere in someone else's home. You don't respect your parent's home enough to teach your kids boundaries for their own safety. So yes, stay away, because you and your kids can't be trusted to stay away from the potentially dangerous dog.", "So the  dogs are put in certain rooms or the backyard but not in the detached garage  when you visit ?

If your parents wanted to rescue the dogs thats their business. \n\nI also think plenty of people will read this quickly, see aggressive dog and just go N T A - BUT your parents do separate the dogs from the guests when you are over but apparently that wasnt enough for you as your kids apparently need \u201cthe run of the house\u201d.

Regardless of disability level you are allowed to have expectations for your kids.\nAs far as dogs go, there\u2019s no info on what your parents have done or if something was happening for them to be bit once each in 2 years.\nI have a reactive dog and anytime someone is over I generally either keep him touching me or send him to the yard.  He hasn\u2019t bit anyone, does come from a bad background and is working on it.  He\u2019s made a ton of progress since he was a foster fail, though he had a lot more to learn and there are few people I trust with him.  Training takes time and effort anytime people come over I\u2019m aware also of what they are doing and reiterating the dogs boundaries and his expectations in the house of where he\u2019s allowed to be and what\u2019s expected of him with company.", "As much as I understand where you\u2019re coming from, especially with the safety of your kids in mind, your parents have the right to say that.\n\nSoft ESH, there\u2019s no winners. They need the dogs trained asap. Maybe for Christmas get them a cheap certificate for a training facility?\n\nYour parents have every right to say it\u2019s their dogs home too. If any friend, family member or anybody came to my home and told me to put my pets away, I would very swiftly walk them to the door. This is their house, not yours.\n\nAgain, I do understand the safety of your kids, which is why your parents do suck too.

No where do I see that the dog is ever let to roam free while the kids are there, and I'm sure OP would be up in arms about that. \n\nThe parents (OP) either haven't taught their kids to respect boundaries in someone else's home, and/or can't safely monitor them to make sure they don't go where the dog is. Special needs or not, that's something they need to learn for safety's sake. Now, OP is indignant because her kids can't go everywhere, and they have meltdowns if they are stopped from going somewhere. So I agree with not visiting, but I wouldn't because the *kids* can't be trusted to safe and not go where the dog is. That's on OP in my book.", "No, but OP's parents do have a vicious dog.

A room that her children might normally access could be a potentially dangerous situation. It's not safe for her kids or the dogs.

My guess is it was buried on purpose\u2026 also the severe dislike for the dogs to begin with was oozing from the beginning.", "I am autistic. It's been 2 years. That's more than enough time to shift expectations. That the kids are still throwing tantrums about having boundaries is concerning.", "I don't disagree that two years is enough time. But it seemed to me that this was a more recent ultimatum and a couple of weeks to shift the expectation in a home that they probably wont be visiting in that time might not be reasonable for her kids specifically. I have students with higher support needs that I could see that being difficult for.\n\nShe stated that she has allowed her children to be around these dogs until a more recent biting incident that landed her father in the emergency room. It does not seem clear how long ago that was.", "The recent incident was a different family party where they lost track of the oldest and thought they might have gone to where the dogs were being kept. So, it was a failure to supervise combined with the kid's history of going where they were told not to."]}
