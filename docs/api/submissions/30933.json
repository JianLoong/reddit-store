First I just wanna say that I\u2019m so happy that you\u2019re in a good place and that you\u2019re doing so well!!! \nSeeing your mom again isn\u2019t something you should feel forced to do. It should only happen when you\u2019re ready to see her and when you have people who can come with you if something happens. They lost custody for a reason and it\u2019s important you focus on yourself and your well-being, not theirs. \nGood luck and I hope your life keeps getting even better!", "NTA. You need to talk to your aunt and uncle about the text messages from your mom. IDK if there's a court order to keep your new address sealed or if there's some other reason to prevent you from seeing your mom, but you need to let your guardians in on the convo so that they can help you make the right decision for you.", "NTA\n\n  \nYour mom lost custody of you for a reason and I'm sorry that you went through whatever it was to lead to this (you DO NOT have to explain the whys in here, that's irreverent). \n\n  \nFrom what I can see, you sound very happy, excited and enjoying life the fullest a 13 year old can right now. If your aunt took you to a park to visit a bunch of family and your mom didn't show up, there's probably a reason for it that the adults didn't inform you of. I'm thinking it's that the case worker(s) felt it best that you didn't see each other face to face just yet. \n\nI would alert your aunt about the texts and your mom asking where you live, she may not be allowed that information at this time.", "NTA: This is a good lesson in boundary setting.   \n  \nThere is a reason that your parents lost custody of you and I'm sure with that there comes a lot of emotional baggage. You are allowed to engage with her as much or as little as you'd like and should not be guilted into that decision. \n\nI am in a similar situation, but have had many more years to think about it. At the end of the day I asked to myself, does this person bring me more joy than pain. And if you decide that they do, you get to choose what that looks like by settings boundaries and sticking to them.", "NTA \n\nIt broke my heart, saying how you were able to have a decent amount of clothes, food, and even your own room. Also, your guardians are making sure you're well taken care of. Which is something your parents didn't do, which resulted in them losing custody of you. You're in a safe and loving environment. Also, don't feel bad. This is something that's legally binding. Enjoy your time with your family and live well.", "NTA, one you are 13 and have essentially no control over that. Two, depending on the status of the cps case, she may not even be able to legally see you.", "**NTA 100%.**\n\nYou should keep living your own happy life with your aunt and uncle and enjoy it! \n\nYour mother is not your problem and you don\u2019t owe her a visit or anything else. Do not feel pressured to tell her where you live; it\u2019s not her business. And you are NOT responsible for her feelings. At all.\n\n**You are NOT the AH.**", "NTA. Please don\u2019t blame yourself for any of this. \n\nWas she invited to the park? If she was, then it\u2019s on her for not going. If she wasn\u2019t invited, there\u2019s probably a legal reason as to why.\n\nI\u2019m glad you are in a good environment and I wish you all the best \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA- Oh sweetie, your own bed and enough food? You've clearly had more than enough to worry about, just let your uncle and aunt take care of you and the schedule etc. I wish you joy of your new room :)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m so happy that you\u2019re somewhere safe and that you\u2019re happy. Do everything you can to protect that.", "NTA, it's up to your aunt and uncle to decide now if she can see you. Trust those adults to keep you safe.", "NAH\n\nYou are a child and are not responsible for where you are going to be. You are not the parental figure here to plan the events for your family to come see you while you are in town. You have no responsibility here since you are a child.", "INFO. Did your aunt tell you the reason she didn't want to visit with your mom?", "NTA.  You were not wrong.  There is a reason you were removed from your mother's custody.  The fact that you mention food being available where you are tells me all I need to know about the situation.  \n\nIf your mother finds out where you are, she may come and try to take you back with her.  Or worse, kidnap you and go on the run.", "NTA. Your mother has either neglected you and your siblings or done something else that is very bad. Otherwise they would not have lost custody of you. If your mother has not been granted visitation, there is a serious reason for that. So don't give up your adress to her, and trust your aunt. When she didn't arrange for you to meet your mother when you were in town, there is also a very good reason for that. You should enjoy all the good things that you now have, the food, the stuff, the bed and soon room of your own, the vacations etc. You should know that all children deserve these things. I think you deserve them probably more than most. I get a strong feeling that you haven't had them before.", "You should escalate these communications straight to your aunt and uncle.\n\nYou are entitled to be happy and I have no idea what the court order/CPS decision was in relation to your placement and care. But I am sure your Dad's brother and his wife do.\n\nNTA. Grasp beauty and happiness where you can and try to trust those who seem to have earned it.", "NTA\n\nListen, your aunt and uncle are your legal guardians now.  This is everything a parent is without being the parent.  Go and tell them that your mom is asking for your location and do it right away.", "I don't think she's allowed to know that because a couple months ago I got in trouble when I told her what school I go to and they told me not to tell her anything else about where we live but I don't know why she would ask if she's not allowed to know.", "I don't have my own room yet but they're turning the playroom into another bedroom and when it's ready I'm gonna get that room.

She may try to take you away (kidnap you) if she knows where you live.\n\nThe fact that you were taken away was for your well being and safety, so don't let her pressure you into it. I really urge you to show the texts to your aunt/case worker.", "I'm just glad you're safe and well taken care of", "Hahaha ok now I hear it that way too. :)", "I would ask your aunt. I don't know why you were taken from your parents but it's possible your aunt is trying to protect you.", "ok ill show it to my aunt when she gets home from work", "thanks. I really like it here", "I dont even visit with my mom when she comes to my house. Jk jk.", "NTA, former foster current adoptive parent here.  One of the hardest things for my bonus kids to understand is that members of their bio family aren\u2019t safe.  It\u2019s really hard to accept that the good times, because there probably some good moments, do not erase the danger someone put you in.  Abusive people are often very manipulative and know how to almost steer your thoughts.  Would you expect one of your friends to be able to pull off a visit on their own?  Would you expect one of your friends to figure out transportation and set up times without an adult?  You wouldn\u2019t.  Until you can figure out her manipulation on your own, try the friend test.  If you wouldn\u2019t expect your friend to do something, your mom shouldn\u2019t expect you too.  If you wouldn\u2019t let your friend be treated the way someone is treating you, it\u2019s probably time to tell an adult.  Or just tell one anyway and ask if what\u2019s happening is okay.  It\u2019s okay to feel torn between your new life and your old one.  It\u2019s okay to have a hard time putting together how bad contact would be.  It\u2019s also okay for you to trust your aunt\u2019s judgment.  Because it\u2019s probably the judgment of her, your attorney, your CASA person, your case manager, your actual judge.  They know what they are doing.  Also, I\u2019m going to tell you something I tell my bonus kids - you are loved and wanted.  Even before you moved in, there was a space for you in your aunt and her family\u2019s heart.  It\u2019s so good you fill it now in person!", "Nta", "NTA and don't tell her where you go to school or where you hang out with your friends. Your mom might show up there. There may be rules that restrict her from seeing you unsupervised.", "i am glad that you are safe and warm where you are. please stay away from your mother. there must be a reason why the courts decided to take away all the kids for their safety.\n\ntell your aunt that your mother is contacting you. i know she is your mom and you love ber but you don't want to ruin the peace you have now.", "NTA I am so glad you are in a safe, warm and secure home with loving people.  You deserve it. As for your mom, talk with your aunt and uncle about her wish to visit you there and tell them if you want her there or not.", "Don\u2019t blame yourself. But if you do want to see mum tell your guardians you would appreciate if they could organise a meeting with her soon. Also tell them about your mum asking for her address and is it ok or not ok to give it out. It can get complicated depending on circumstances, so perhaps meeting her somewhere else might be good.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe your biological mother anything. As a CPS Worker, I see and unfortunately take part in removals of children regularly. For you to have been removed, the situation must have been serious. For her not to have gotten any of her children back, she must not have made any of the changes necessary to do so. You just stand strong and live your best life and don\u2019t worry about her unless she makes the life changes necessary to re earn your respect. Even then, that would only be if you are willing to re-establish a relationship.", "I know! Her own bed, enough food, and the idea of her own room excites her! She deserves all of this and the security of people who are able to care for her. Her mother may love her, but she's not currently in a position to give OP what she needs.", "And it didn't even require a blood test to prove it!", "replying to you directly --\n\nYour are 13.  You are still very young to most Redditors.  It sounds like your Aunt had control of your schedule, not you.  It sounds like your Aunt arranged for things.\n\nOthers have asked you talk to your Aunt, and to your guardians.  You may not be aware of the legalities surrounding contact.  They are correct.\n\nI am happy that you have found a safe place to live.  That is important.  Good luck.", "Do that.  You\u2019re NTA for *any* of this.  Your mom\u2019s behavior is not your fault.\n\nYour new home sounds fantastic and I\u2019m so glad you live there now!  Best of wishes to you, honey.  It sounds like things are gonna be okay.", "Maybe they know already but make sure your aunt and uncle know this."]}
