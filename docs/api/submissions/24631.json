Sorry but this have future DV all over it. \n\nAlienate future wife from family? this way when his colors come out, she won't have anywhere to run? Thats his goal here.", "He'll probably give different answers and then gaslight people who call him on it. \n\n\"Stuck in traffic.\" \n\n\"Tragic fungal infection. Wiped the whole family out. Started in a toenail.\" \n\n\"Couldn't decide what to wear.\" \n\n\"Actually working for The Shop. Deep cover. Can't be seen here.\"", "That will only backfire and play into the whatever BS agenda the fianc\u00e9 has to separate OP\u2019s daughter from her family.", "All he has to do is sit down.  Are they going to pause the wedding to kick him out in front of everyone for the audacity to stay?  \nSomeday she\u2019s gonna need help getting out. She should know her family will be there for her, even if they don\u2019t entirely forgive her for her choices.", "I would say he should walk her down the aisle, then sit himself down in the front row. They will either continue with the ceremony or fianc\u00e9 will show his true colors in front of everyone", "He could always stick around juuuuust long enough to object when the priest asks for that.", "Could it be a compulsive liar?", "I was thinking this too. The father literally gives the daughter -- a possession -- to the husband, and she then becomes his property. I guarantee that's what the fiance is thinking. Her father is in effect giving permission for him to treat her like crap and abuse her.", "I get the vibe she is trying to leave a cult", "It should be, but I can't tell what it's telling us! \n\nDo her siblings not speak to her because of her fiance? Does she not speak to her siblings because of something from their childhood? Is the entire family super racist or something, and she's just willing to throw her dad a bone because he's the least problematic one?", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think any of them are invited.", "If youre from a dysfunctional family with a primary abuser and an enabler you tend to glorify the enabler because usually theyre not as bad as the other parent (or so you think at least). I kept contact with my enabling dad for a while after cutting contact to my mother until i relised that his inaction and carelessness about me was no less hurtful than the blatant abuse of my mother. Ops kid might be in a similar position and not feeling ready yet to go the step to cut contact with dad as well.", "He should respect that. But it sounds like he already has a great deal of control over her and possibly conceded to one little thing to keep her compliant.", "Probably not now that you mention it.", "It's odd she'd invite the abusive dad to walk her down the aisle to have him leave after. Why?", "That\u2019s ridiculous. This is why this post is fake. Nobody in their right mind would agree to do that.", "Yeah, I can see either situation being true. Fianc\u00e9 is controlling or family wronged daughter in some way or potentially both, because someone with a history of abuse is more likely to find themselves in abuse moving forward. Regardless, I don\u2019t think the daughter is mature enough or of sound enough mind to marry anyone if she can\u2019t clearly express what is going on and what went wrong. If her parents were really terribly abusive and she doesn\u2019t want to confront them, that\u2019s fine but she should totally remove them from her life at that point and not ask her Father to walk her down the aisle. There is a clear lack of either maturity or emotional processing going on.\n\nThe weird thing is that asking your father to walk you down the aisle is symbolically asking your father to approve of your marriage. The father should not walk her down the aisle if the fianc\u00e9 dislikes the father but the fianc\u00e9 is not \u201cman enough\u201d to confront the father or say why.\n\nAlso, entirely different thought. Is this some weird social class shit where the groom\u2019s family is upper class and the daughter is lovely and gorgeous and happens to be lower class and the groom doesn\u2019t want to be embarrassed by her family? \n\nSomething is going on here but none of us have enough info to really know what.", "We don't know a timeline in when the relationship between the siblings became strained.  It's possible that it's directly because of the fianc\u00e9 's treatment of their sister.", "Asking her father to walk her down the aisle, then leave is hardly glorifying. It\u2019s more like it\u2019s a chore to get out of the way.", "Yes, like how can the fianc\u00e9 not like you and you have absolutely no idea why, not even an inkling. Sounds like someone is oblivious to everything but their own bubble.", "I think there is also a chance the daughter is using the fiance as a scapegoat and that she doesn't really want them there either but just says it is him in order to not upset them more. Father walking her down the aisle may be more a concession to tradition or image than anything.", "I also think it could be because the daughters family has some toxic worldviews. Maybe the parents are racist (for example) and the daughter loves them because they are her parents and they have been good(ish) to her but she also acknowledges that they are racist and having them around fianc\u00e9s family is just not a good idea. They compromise by letting dad walk her down the aisle but then see him out", "Notice though how the husband took the daughters side with the mothers comment. It\u2019s odd to me that he wouldn\u2019t be just as livid about the truncated invite for himself and lack of invite for his wife. \n\nI wonder if OP does know more than she is letting on.", "Sounds to me like she wants her dad there, but doesn\u2019t want him to be able to bring her mom as a +1. Realistically, he probably won\u2019t walk away immediately afterwards and stay at least that\u2019s what it really seems like to me obviously a ton of information is missing so we\u2019re all pretty much talking out of our asses", "Idk it would actually be even more weird for the father to just show up for the few minutes to walk her down, and leave and not be there for pictures, speeches, dancing, then to not be there at all. \n\nAnd for him to be the only one without his wife, her mother, would at least where I am make more talk/gossip. People would be whispering behind their drinks about how the brides father was there but isn't now, or why didn't her mother come too. What drama is going on in the family? Where if neither show up, you can play it off as dad/mom got a horrible cold/flu and didn't want to chance giving it to others. We miss them, but their health is way more important.", "Same. My father is also a diagnosed narcissist (and abuser like physical, mental, emotional, and financial (even raped my mother) to his wife and children). I knew it was unhealthy the relationship. My husband disliked my father the 1st time he met him, and my father opened his mouth. But that could be because the 1st thing the dumbest said was, \"She's a liar, don't believe anything she says about her childhood.\". Where, at that time, my husband (at the time  BF) didn't know anything about the abuse I received under his home. \n\nFor 10 years, my husband bit his tongue around my father because it was my decision to cut contact. I only had my husband be around him if it was absolutely necessary. I finally cut contact when my mother divorced him, and he had the nerve to tell me he's feelings on my childhood. My husband is a fucking saint of a man.\n\n My family is extremely dysfunctional. My only savings grace is my grandparents. But if my husband had \"made\" me cut out parts of my family, then I wouldn't have worked on myself, I wouldn't have grown as a person. \n\nWhich ever way the reason could be the parents being toxic or the groom both sound horrible. \n\nBut I do find it interesting that the basic facts of the relationship change every time they see this guy. Like, how does the \"how did you meet\" story change? It's part of the foundation of the story, unless they are lying big time about their relationship, like they possibly met on Tinder for hookups and are ashamed? But then you would think they would have a single story that stays consistent, huh just weird, lol.", "Maybe it\u2019s OP that\u2019s the problem too. Daughter knows that there isn\u2019t really a way to only invite the dad but not OP so this is her compromise."]}
