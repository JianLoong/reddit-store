He also lives in a different country so we havent been seeing him as often", "Like what?", "I think it\u2019s just with the family? Her friend is her maid of honor", "She doesn't expect them to attend. They are not invited. Her dad and only her dad, was invited to walk her down the isle and leave after.", "Like what? OP has answered all questions.", "From the fiance? Yes. From the OP? No.", "You seriously cannot make that statement given the context... (Lack of)\n\nIt's one of two main options form what I can tell either the daughter's husband is trying to control hi fiance or more likely given the strained relationship with the daughters siblings, OP was a a shit parent and the new husband can rightfully see that but the daughter is too blinded by familial ties to go no contact.", "You don\u2019t even attempt to describe your relationship with her. You say you see the fianc\u00e9 only a handful of times.", "Unless her parents were awful and caused his future wife a ton of pain. Or if hes a minority and theyre openly racist or some shit like that. There just isnt enough info here.", "When was ask him one thing, something about his interest, he usually gives short answers. The next time we see him we were trying to get to know him more, so we thought the previous answers would work, because it was something he was interested in.\n\nOnly for him to change the answer and deny ever saying the previous answer", "Sadly, I doubt you will get an honest and objective answer from the source on this one.", ">Did\n\nAnd tells them different stories about himself everytime they meet, because they were bad parents.", "I got a subtle vibe of that too. Even if you don\u2019t love your partners family, there really shouldn\u2019t be any reason for why they shouldn\u2019t be invited. It sounds like the daughter wants her dad there at least, so why isn\u2019t he invited to the wedding fully?", "She didn\u2019t say the daughter didn\u2019t like them.", "I highly doubt this is the case...  While it is absolutely in the realm of possibilities, I would put my money on the fact that the fianc\u00e9 is a narcissist. He is cutting the daughter off from her family right before their eyes.  It's a huge red flag.  Again, not to say that the mother and father haven't said or done anything, but... I've been this girl.  This is a tactic of his.", "NEI?", "I mean honestly now that I think about it, maybe he should walk her down the aisle and then make a bit of a scene in his exit so that people notice that her father is not staying at the wedding. That\u2019s what I would do but I\u2019m also extremely petty.", ">He\u2019s leaning towards walking her down\n\nIMHO, and I could be wrong, she needs the wake-up call.  She needs a glimpse  of what losing contact with her parents will look like.  That's where this is headed, clearly.  If he has her under his thumb enough to keep her from inviting **her parents** to their wedding, then she is in real trouble here.", "Please convince him not to\u2026 I know this is your child. However, she needs to deal with the consequences of the decisions that she\u2019s making.. she\u2019s allowing her soon to be husband to dictate her relationships with her family. Let her feel with that looks like.", "If I was op I would show the husband this thread", "Also, why does OP keep asking how they met after he\u2019s already been told? The story wouldn\u2019t be changing if OP didn\u2019t keep asking. \n\nVery strange. Sounds like there is some backstory\u2026\n\nInfo: is the fianc\u00e9 from your same cultural background?", "OP explained that in a comment. She has personality clashes with her sister and her brother isn't close to anyone in the family.", "Yeah, then this is sign of him just being a controlling jerk. I'd be pretty upset at my daughter for allowing him to alienate her own parents for her wedding.\n\nUnless she was no contact with you or truly didn't want you there, there's no reason why your're being excluded. His family is good enough to attend but not hers? F that bs.", "It sounds like he is tying to isolate her from her family. Please make sure she knows if this turns nasty after they marry that she can ALWAYS  come home.", "If this is how he feels I would expect that you will likely not see much of your daughter or potential grand children from them. This whole thing is just odd. If there was never an incident that took place, I would imagine that your daughter explained to him what you guys are like/what you stand for, and he is fundamentally opposed to the two of you. But outside of that, I have no idea why he wouldn't want you there. I think you need to tell your daughter that as her parents you deserve to know the reason why. And go from there.", "Very very very possible! 10% of my mind went there as well. You also need to be open to the possibility that this is all the daughter too. She is not close with her siblings at all and doesn't seem super close with her parents. She said she wanted them there and that it was fiance decision. But she does not seem to be fighting too hard on it. It's very possible that she wants to completely be done with her family and not come back, so this is a way of ushering them out before they get calls about grand baby's. \nI had a friend who seemed like she was being abused. Turned out the dude she was with was super cool and that she secretly hated her family for something that happened in high school, has wanted to leave and never come back since then, but didn't want to break their hearts. So she blamed it on the boyfriend and moved 1000 miles away to the west coast.", "How would the person you're responding to know the missing information if they ain't OP? Do you understand how misguided this question is? Lol", "OP has an adult son that \"doesn't talk much around family,\" and moved to a different country. Now her daughter doesn't want her at her wedding, either.\n\nYes, I'm getting missing missing reasons vibes from OP. Feel free to argue with someone else though", "Hmm your defo NTA then, sounds like you were trying to connect and he wasn\u2019t having it.", "I suspect we\u2019re missing a lot of information.", "Nothing supports that - she isn't close to any of her other immediate relatives", "not enough information", "Not enough information.", "If the brother ain't close to anyone in the family that's far more of a red flag on OP than their daughter and fiance.", "Oh. The sub\u2019s verdict for that is INFO.", "I think you're meant to use the INFO judgement, and specifically request some.", "Not really. I\u2019m not close with any of my family outside of my mom just because I enjoy my solitude not because I have an issue with them\u2026 they see me once every other year.. unless I tell them, otherwise, they know that there\u2019s no issues between us. So lack of communication is not always a red flag. Sometimes it\u2019s just a lack of interest.", "I think NEI was used to be in the past, I really don't care.  I feel INFO is more for clarification, I think OP might be deliberately leaving out information so I used the obsolete acronym."]}
