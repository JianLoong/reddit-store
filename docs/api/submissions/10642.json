Once a month, one couple hosts a dinner party.\n\nOne of the women in the group A(30s) is vegan, and this has never been a problem. When it is their turn to host, they serve vegan food; when it\u2019s our turn to host, I usually make her a vegan version of the meal I make for everyone else. She has always been grateful for the fact that I do my best for her to feel included. \n\nLast time they hosted a dinner, the meal had soy sauce in it. I am very allergic to soy. So I get there, she tells me the meal has soy in it (everyone knows I am allergic to it), then she hands me a takeout menu and tells me to order something for me. I found this extremely rude, since I go the extra mile for her to have almost the same meal, and she couldn\u2019t even whip up a stir fry without soy sauce for me. I didn\u2019t say anything, because I didn\u2019t want to spoil the mood.\n\nThe next day, I sent her a text, and told her that I felt a bit hurt that she did not try to accommodate my allergy, when I do the same for her chosen lifestyle. She replied and told me that she doesn\u2019t have to accommodate me, all she has to do is provide me a meal, which she did. \n\nSo I decided fair is fair, I will no longer be making a whole different meal for her anymore.\n\nLast Saturday was our turn to host the dinner, I made steak, mashed potatoes, bacon wrapped asparagus and a triple chocolate cake for desert.\n\nWhen they arrived, I handed her a menu to a vegan restaurant and told her to chose her meal. She was shocked. Usually I would have made her some grilled mushrooms, vegan mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus, and a vegan chocolate cake. She was pouty the whole evening.\n\nHer husband ended up telling my husband that what I did was very petty, and it made her feel extremely excluded, since I was usually the only one who made her feel included during these dinners. My husband just told him my wife treated your wife how she treated her.\n\nNow they are calling me a petty AH.

Petty, maybe, but she opened Pandora's Box by establishing the \"baseline rule\" of only having to provide you a meal. Honestly, what did she expect? Your friend sounds intolerable.", "NTA your friend needs to learn empathy", "NTA \n\n#FAFO", "NTA -", "NTA. Sounds like you were basically cooking two dinners every time you hosted. She couldn\u2019t figure out an alternative option for you once. \n\nYou get to throw her words back in their face. Luckily it\u2019s saved via text. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to accommodate her. You just have to provide her a meal. \n\nHer lifestyle is by choice. Yours is an allergy. She did not care one bit. Time for you to stop caring.", "This was very petty. AND I LOVE IT! GOOD JOB OP! NTA", "NTA", "ESH - not accommodating your allergies was yeah, maybe a bit childish, however maybe she had forgotten your allergy, cooked the meal and then ten mi utes before arrival her husband went \"hiney [insert name] is allergic to soy remember?\" when it's too late to do anything else for you and this was a one off blip (not trying to excuse her behaviour in anyway because I wasn't there, I don't know the ins and outs of her life or yours or anything else, however I will play devil's advocate and point out there are potential reasons she did what she did other than pettiness)\n\nStooping to that \"you excluded me so I'll exclude you\" mentality deliberately is a small-minded, petty move to make. I can see why you went down that route, but you could have been the bigger person and proved how much better you are than her by ostentatious bending over backwards to accommodate her in a more \"Hey, look at me, look how thoughtful and considerate I am, I'm so much better than you\" style", "Lol NTA, she decided to act like an AH with apparently the only couple who would accommodate her, I wonder why is she surprised at all after talking to you like that, and I also wonder what do the other 2 couples think about this", "NTA.  'Petty' is often used as a code word for 'you don't get to treat me how I treat you.'", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t \u201cpetty\u201d, it was fair", "NTA. I\u2019m stunned she and her husband had the audacity to question you when she did the exact same thing to you! Apparently your friend and her husband are \u201crules for thee not for me\u201d people. But good for you, you\u2019ve saved yourself a lot of cooking/prep time at your future dinner parties.", "NTA. Some people clearly weren't taught \"Treat others how you want to be treated.\"", "NTA. I am a firm believer in \u201cYou do you and I will do me.\u201d However I am starting to get angry with people who have dietary restrictions and want everyone else to accommodate them. For example, if I am not vegan and I attempt to accommodate your vegan diet when we are together why would you refuse to provide me with meat, potatoes etc. when I come to eat at your house? Yet, I hear comments like we don\u2019t allow those things in our house. So, I feel as though I should be able to refuse to accommodate your diet. So not continue to invite these people into your home is they are going to be callous and unaccommodating to you! She is not a friend.", "Petty?  Extremely. But still NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m a vegan who loves to cook. I also can\u2019t have gluten. Outsiders may initially find that extremely restrictive, but I\u2019ve had close friends go out of their way to find recipes that we can all eat and enjoy. In my personal experience, I find people with any kind of food restriction, whether chosen or allergies, are generally more open to trying alternative ingredients or new dishes (as OP clearly demonstrates). I\u2019d understand if she made two vegan meals, one with soy and one without, similar to how you accommodate her. But not providing food for OP is incredibly rude and I truly cannot wrap my mind around why anyone would host a dinner party and exclude a particular guest", "NTA she fucked around and found out", "NTA. You've repeatedly gone out of your way to make sure there was home-cooked food she could enjoy when dinner was your place, and she couldn't return the favor once when she made something she knows you can't eat? She easily could've made something else or made some without the soy sauce. The fact she was shocked when you treated her the exact same way she treated you shows how entitled she is", "NTA at all. You were very kind in accommodating her dietary choice (calling it a choice assuming she\u2019s not vegan due to medical reasons) and then she turned around and refused to accommodate your dietary requirement.", "NTA. Given that you go out of your way for her she was extremely rude to just hand you a menu like here you go.", "Definitely nta!", "NTA  If that is the way she is going to be then that is how she can be treated.  \n\nIt is not hard to not cook using soy sauce but still put it on the table for those who are not allergic.", "Petty? Yes BUT SO WHAT you badass! Fuck that ***** she got exactly what she, \u201cordered\u201d lol.\nWhich was a main course of reciprocation with a side of *uck around and find out!\n\nNTA your friend is an entitled hypocrite", "NTA. You have been beyond accommodating, and yet, she refused to do the same. Did she truly expect or think she deserved a different outcome? You stood your ground and I am proud of you for it.", "NTA I am vegan and if a friend made the effort for me then I would absolutely make the effort for them. What a rude woman your friend is", "NTA in the slightest, but I am curious, did you have to pay for your own takeout when you were at her house?  I'm trying to think through the logistics of this, time for delivery, the delivery fee, etc.  You showed kindness and courtesy, your friend showed what an AH she is.", "NTA.  She's the one who changed the arrangement by ignoring your needs despite you having always accommodated her wants.  It's fair to respond in kind.", "NTA. What you did might have been petty but as she said, you provided her with a meal.", "NTA you were petty but it is better to be petty than to be stepped on by an AH", "NTA. Was it petty? Sure. But now she knows how it feels to be excluded and maybe she\u2019ll think twice next time. ESPECIALLY since hers is a chosen lifestyle whereas you actually have an allergy. \n\nShe fucked around and found out.", "NTA. I love a petty move", "vegan here--- NTA\n\nthere are soooooo many options to replace soy sauce that are readily available at most groery stores. food allergies are serious stuff and not accomidating them is beyond rude.", "NTA - people reap what they sow.    She evidently forgot what she did to you.   One of the things that gets me these days if people think their actions don't have consequences.   If it comes up again and she's whining about what you did, ask her to imagine how you felt about the soy situation, so you thought it would be okay.", "NTA\n\nI love this level of pettiness. I strive to be this petty.", "NTA. So what are you going to do when they host again and the meal contains vats of Soy which smart money says it will? I'm not sure if I would tell her you're done with the pissing match and just leave or march out to the car to retrieve the bloody steak dinner you picked up on the way there.", "She played fuck around and find out. \nAnd as much as I like to use soy sauce, there are so many delicious dishes you can cook without soy. \n\nNTA", "It was very petty, but you gave her an alternative to the meal you had made, so I don't see a problem, NTA\ud83e\udd37", "It's absolutely petty, and I wouldn't be surprised if the dinner parties stopped happening for a while. However, you're NTA. I generally believe in \"treat others as you want to be treated\". If she's so upset that you made her feel excluded when you normally go out of your way to make her feel included, why did she exclude you? If you would like to remain friends with her, I would suggest having a conversation with her about it outside of the dinner parties. I think at the very least, if something with a dietary restriction is going to be excluded from eating the meal, they should be notified ahead of time so they can make an educated decision about whether they want to attend or not.", "NTA\n\nWas it petty? Yes, a little. But it was also a learning moment for her, and an important one at that. She now has a chance to reflect on her own actions and come to the conclusion \"if I don't like bring treated that way, maybe I shouldn't treat people like that either\". And thats an important lesson for her to learn.", "NTA and based on the info in your post you couldn\u2019t have handled it any better. Also it\u2019s nice to read of a husband who stands up for their partner.", "ESH. Hope you can work it out with your friend.", "you were calm, didn\u2019t cause a scene in the moment, and (it seems) calmly talked to her the next day stating you felt left out. she basically told you that wasn\u2019t her problem. it\u2019s not, but it\u2019s still very rude considering you are accommodating to her and were (presumably) polite when initiating the conversation. \u201ctit for tat\u201d isn\u2019t the way to go, however, you did try to speak with her about it and, i cant\u2019t be sure, but her reaction leads me to believe she wasn\u2019t planning to avoid soy sauce again. NTA, but i would follow up with her and see if there\u2019s any sort of agreement the two of you can come to, like her giving you a heads up so you can plan accordingly. it\u2019s up to you what you do with her meals moving forward, but i would wait until after you talk to her again to see if things change before just making a decision. you\u2019re also not obligated to make a special meal, just provide a meal generally.", "Definitely NTA.\nAlso, not petty. \nShe made a lifestyle choice, you respected her choice and accommodated her.\nYou have an allergy, she chose to ignore it.

You treated her with empathy and respect, she didn\u2019t. Arguably how she treated you was worse too: being vegan is a choice, the soy allergy actively harms you, they are not equal.", "NTA, she drew first blood, you were exactly the right amount petty about it, she should take the L and make sure to accommodate you as normal next time and then you never have to talk about it again.", "What goes around comes around.\n\nNta", "OP, you are not a petty AH. You reciprocated how you were treated. She's just mad because she's getting her just desserts. NTA - and I would ignore her husband since he's just taking sides to make his pouty wife happy.", "NTA. It\u2019s just plain rude to not accommodate someone for an allergy when they consistently accommodate your chosen food preferences. Especially considering you have accommodated her multiple times and the one time she could reciprocate she takes the lazy way out.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, and I've seen this so many times, when Vegans have people over to their homes, they cook vegan and expect everyone eat it.  Then they go over to other people's homes and expect to be catered to.  It is totally one sided and unfair.  \n\nYour allergies are more important than her chosen diet.  They are not the same.  Your allergies can kill you.  Her eating meat is just icky to her.  She was nice and told you about the soy that she used.  But that's where her respect for you ended.", "NTA. Now let\u2019s sing along to the \u201c(s) he had it coming\u201d song from Cell Block Tango.", "NTA. \n\nshe fucked around and found out.", "NTA funny how rules for thee and not for me can turn against you", "NTA. Why put the energy into someone who doesn't do the same for you?", "NTA. She started being a dick and was surprised that it came with consequences such as being treated how she decided to treat others.", "NTA - the only thing I would have done differently is wait for her to ask where the vegan option was.  That is when you pull out the menu and say you provided a meal already.  Extra petty points if you ensured your potatoes are vegan so she has the most basic meal option available haha.", "I\u2019m vegan and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole based on her previous behavior lol NTA", "NTA. \nAn allergy is a medical condition, being vegan is a lifestyle choice. \nYou go out of your way to support their choice, but cannot be bothered to respect your condition, that is disrespectful. \nAnd anybody that says you\u2019re pretty have no idea how much out of your way you went for her by making a whole separate meal.", "It appears the vegan didn\u2019t like to be treated the same way she treats others. The vegan is definitely the AH, and her hubby is a close second.", "A bit petty, but NTA.", "NTA. She set the bar and didn\u2019t like it when it hit her in the face.", "NTA. You literally did exactly what she did back. If she\u2019s upset about it, that means she knows what she did was wrong.", "NTA - you reached out to her directly and communicated your feelings, you made an honest, mature, effort to resolve the situation. She didn't want that... and now she's upset and calling you petty. How much is this friendship worth?", "I applaud you OP-not only for repeatedly going out of your way to accommodate this entitled woman, but for your pettiness after she treated you like dirt.\n\nNTA and virtual high five from me, a former vegan.", "NTA. You threw what she did back in her face and now she\u2019s mad. Honestly, petty isn\u2019t always wrong. She needed to know how you felt and now she does firsthand. Of course, \u201cit\u2019s different\u201d I\u2019m sure.", "NTA. Not even petty.

You appreciated her but she didn't appreciate you so NTA you did well.", "Oh, you were indeed petty. Perfectly, perfectly petty. NTA though.", "NTA. You get back what you give out. In this case it was takeout.", "Excellent! NTA", "NTA. What\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander. I\u2019m surprised she wasn\u2019t expecting exactly that since you called her out on what she did to you.", "NTA- it\u2019s a lot of work making a whole separate meal for someone. You shouldn\u2019t feel like you have to do all that every single time.", "NTA, you literally just did the exact thing she did. If they think that's petty, they also have to admit it was petty when she did it the first time. Why go out of your way to accommodate someone who won't reciprocate?", "NTA. She couldn\u2019t exclude 1 ingredient, meanwhile you\u2019ve been making her entire vegan meals. The fact she had the audacity to be shocked when you pulled a her on her is laughable", "NTA. That was a poor decision on her part.  I mean, she could have thrown together pasta and sauce it would still have been less insulting than a take-out menu. \n\nShe had a perfect FAFO.", "NTA. I don't even think it was petty. The friend was rude, especially in the texts after the meal where she provided you a menu. That was her opportunity to apologize and say \"yeah, I see what you mean. I always appreciate that you take the time to make sure the meals work for me. I'll do better next time. Sorry for being a jerk.\" She dropped the ball.", "Obviously NTA, but INFO:  I have to know how the husband or any of these people claiming you were petty thought this was different from how she treated you.", "Petty? Heck yes. AH? F no.\n\nNTA, you went above and beyond to make her feel included in your meals, and she can't be bothered to make a separate dish for you without your allergen? And then she whines about being left out when you do the exact same thing she did to you, back to her? She can dish it out, but can't take the heat herself.", "NTA. At first I thought she was going to say she was afraid of cross contamination and therefore asked you to order take out just to be safe. But once she said she didn\u2019t have to accommodate you it was obvious she\u2019s TA.", "NTA. She said she doesn\u2019t have to accommodate you, and you don\u2019t have to accommodate her. How is it fair that she can expect special treatment when she wouldn\u2019t do the same for you?", "People love to call others petty for treating them like they treat others.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Why was ordering takeout an option for her, but not for you? Quid pro quo.", "NTA. The phrase 'fuck about, find out' comes to mind.", "NTA.", "ESH. Both of you are petty and ridiculous. Time to grow up. Do you really think getting your \"revenge\" will strengthen your relationship?", "You both sound like bad friends \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA she didn't like the taste of her own medicine.", "NTA.. Golden rule, treat others how you want to be treated. She showed you how she wanted you to treat her by treating you that way. She f\\*\\*\\*ed around and found out that two can play that game. ... (yes I am a petty Bitch..)", "NTA, you told her you were hurt by what she did and she doubled down and said she wasn't obligated to cook for you. Why on earth would you cook for her? If you hadn't said anything I might feel differently but she couldn't even be bothered to apologize when you let her know what she did was hurtful.", "NTA. She chose to act petty and is upset you are treating her the same way she treated you. Good for you.", "NTA. What a ridiculous pair. If she felt you were the only one making her feel included, wasn\u2019t that an even bigger reason to do the same for you?", "NTA \n\n\nYou gave the exact same energy back and I salute you! Good job letting her have the exact same experience she gave you!", "NTA. First, having a good allergy is significantly more serious than choosing to be vegan. Second, you've gone out of your way to make her a vegan meal, she repayed you be serving a meal with your known allergen and then doubled down by handing you a menu and saying her obligation was to provide a meal. SHE was the petty one, you just followed her lead.", "absolutely NTA i\u2019m personally shocked at what she did to you. she found out though.", "NTA I would also point out that there is a difference between an allergy and a preference. Depending on the severity of your allergy accidentally eating soy could kill you. Her eating meat products probably wont kill her (unless there is a medical reason for her preference but we don\u2019t have that info).", "NTA, but I'm sure that she'll start cooking everything with soy from now. If you want to go to next dinner hosted by her - better take your meal with you.", "ESH.\n\nYou did what you did out of spite.", "I\u2019m a little blown away. It is significantly more difficult to make a vegan meal than to not use soy sauce. She\u2019s truly not grateful for your efforts and it shows. I bet you can look at your relationship and see more examples of her selfishness.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhat type of host hands you a menu when youve consistently accommodated her preference, then wonder why they get treated the same? \n\nUnbelievable?", "NTA. What's really messed up is most vegans would know about coconut aminos as they are preferred over soy sauce in most vegan cooking. It's really not like she didn't have options to accommodate you.", "NTA. She's lucky you didn't serve a pig's head or a whole fish.", "[removed]", "NTA. I don't think you were being petty. I think you realized that it wasn't worth it for you to go the extra mile and do extra work to accommodate her if she wasn't willing to do the same for you. It's crazy that she would openly say that you're the only one who made her feel included and then turn around and intentionally do the opposite to you.", "NTA wouldn't she feel more inclined to accommodate you considering she said herself that you're one of the only ones to do that for her? She clearly did not consider that you may have felt excluded when she had the meal at her home. Taste of her own medicine!", "It\u2019s just crazy that she got that text and didn\u2019t realize you hold all the cards. Hopefully she just backs down and doesn\u2019t ruin your custom", "NTA. I think what you did is awesome. Accommodating her for her CHOSEN lifestyle is much more difficult than your allergy just to soy. After she pulled that (especially her comments about just needing to provide a meal) she shouldn't have been surprised this happened.", "NTA but now you should have the conversation again, perhaps she will see the error that she made before. If not, things are going to go downhill I would suspect.", "I mean I see why everyone is saying N T A but I'd say ESH personally. If she knew about your well known allergy and didn't try to accommodate and then made you order takeout yes, she totally sucks. But you don't suck - you are a nice woman who always made a vegan meal to accommodate your vegan dinner guest. Now it's like that was contingent on her accommodating you, not just what kind of a person you are. Not saying you are a bad person, esp since clearly most people here agree you did nothing wrong. Being the bigger person helps my mental health. Even if no one noticed or I was taken for granted, etc.", "[removed]", "NTA. Petty, yeah, but you went the extra mile to include her when her dietary preference is harder to accommodate, and she couldn't mix you some food without soy? I'd have maybe just not invited that couple over, but I don't know all the nuances of your friend group.", "NTA. Sometimes you have to be petty. No reason for her to think you should accommodate her CHOSEN lifestyle if she can\u2019t accommodate your ALLERGY. Also glad you have a husband that will stick up for you.", "NTA. You did to her exactly what she did to you, I don\u2019t see how she has any ground to stand on here. \n\nAlso, she could have easily used coconut aminos as a replacement for soy sauce and been inclusive of you or excluded soy sauce from your portion altogether.", "You literally treated her how she treated you?

Sounds like she set expectations and OP adjusted. - NTA", "NTA\n\n>it made her feel extremely excluded, since I was usually the only one who made her feel included during these dinners.\n\nWhat are the other two couples doing when it's their turn to host?", "I would have called you on pettiness... if you hadn't already had the conversation with her. I mean, what a complete arsehole SHE is. Not petty - what goes around fuckin' comes around.\n\nNTA", "Lmao NTA. obviously", "Vegans are not generally intolerable to be around. NTA. Rules go both ways, and you didn't make the 'provide a meal via takeout' rule.", "NTA - as a former vegetarian I would go to dinner parties every Sunday and not a single one of them \u201ccatered\u201d (no pun intended) to my diet. I would just bring food and cook my meal when the chef was cooking the family meal, and I always made extra to share with the meat-eaters. \n\nThe fact you went out of your way to make a vegan meal for her makes you a freaking angel. She should have shown you the same respect. Now you\u2019ve \u201cdished\u201d it back to her (pun intended that time!), and she\u2019s pouting. Sheesh, the nerve! \n\nAll this said, the conflict between the two of you has the potential to end your monthly dinner parties all together - so if you don\u2019t want that to happen, you and her should try to find a resolution.

You were nice enough to even provide a Vegan restaurant menus, where as I would have provided a menu to a place that had one, MAYBE two vegan OPTIONS and repeated \u201call I have to do is provide you A MEAL\u201d. \n\nYes. I am aware I typically am TA.", "NTA  she was perfectly fine doing it to you, she damn well ought to feel perfectly fine with it being done back to her.", "As a vegan I will say you're NTA.

But heh.", "> She replied and told me that she doesn\u2019t have to accommodate me, all she has to do is provide me a meal, which she did. \n\nOoooooh!

This is treating someone how they treat you. \n\nShe can\u2019t expect you to do something for her that she was not willing to do for you", "NTA but I don't think handing you a takeout menu and asking you to order what you want is awful at all. I have dietary restrictions and would be happy with that solution at a friend's house. Maybe she was pressed for time. In any case, that way you could have a meal of exactly what you want. At the same time, I don't understand why she was upset that you did the same when you hosted. It doesn't seem like a reason to be upset, IMO.", "This is a good example of why I only have like 3 friends. Why should anyones day be ruined by such nonsense?", "(100% NTA, though my first two paragraphs don't seem like it.)\n\nI personally think people who are not familiar with cookimg with various restrictions (like vegan, gluten-free, multiple allergies, etc.) can be given slack for not making a meal to accommodate a guest.\n\nShe and her husband think you deliberately not cooking a vegan meal for her was rude because you obviously were able to cook vegan meals for all the other times.\n\nWell, those **hypocrites** can be shut down by pointing out how it's obvious she is able to make a meal for you that didn't have soy sauce, proof being you were able to eat her other meals before, but deliberately chose not to.\n\nShe chose to not reciprocated your kindness even though she could have done so with just a bit more effort. A bit of effort that is a fraction of the effort you had put into making an all vegan meal for just her each time. People tend to not put in any more effort for adults who choose to not give even a fraction of that effort back.", "NTA in the slightest. They sell Ocean's Halo at Walmart. And it's only, like $3. There's no reason she couldn't have gotten a soy-free alternative. Also, it's ridiculously difficult to find soy-free restaurant items.", "NTA and going forward you might want to be really cautious of eating food she makes.

Once a month, one couple hosts a dinner party.\n\nOne of the women in the group A(30s) is vegan, and this has never been a problem. When it is their turn to host, they serve vegan food; when it\u2019s our turn to host, I usually make her a vegan version of the meal I make for everyone else. She has always been grateful for the fact that I do my best for her to feel included. \n\nLast time they hosted a dinner, the meal had soy sauce in it. I am very allergic to soy. So I get there, she tells me the meal has soy in it (everyone knows I am allergic to it), then she hands me a takeout menu and tells me to order something for me. I found this extremely rude, since I go the extra mile for her to have almost the same meal, and she couldn\u2019t even whip up a stir fry without soy sauce for me. I didn\u2019t say anything, because I didn\u2019t want to spoil the mood.\n\nThe next day, I sent her a text, and told her that I felt a bit hurt that she did not try to accommodate my allergy, when I do the same for her chosen lifestyle. She replied and told me that she doesn\u2019t have to accommodate me, all she has to do is provide me a meal, which she did. \n\nSo I decided fair is fair, I will no longer be making a whole different meal for her anymore.\n\nLast Saturday was our turn to host the dinner, I made steak, mashed potatoes, bacon wrapped asparagus and a triple chocolate cake for desert.\n\nWhen they arrived, I handed her a menu to a vegan restaurant and told her to chose her meal. She was shocked. Usually I would have made her some grilled mushrooms, vegan mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus, and a vegan chocolate cake. She was pouty the whole evening.\n\nHer husband ended up telling my husband that what I did was very petty, and it made her feel extremely excluded, since I was usually the only one who made her feel excluded during these dinners. My husband just told him my wife treated your wife how she treated her.\n\nNow they are calling me a petty AH. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'd just explain that you previously went out of your way to accommodate her because you thought that's the kind of friendship y'all had.

OP is the only member accommodating the vegans, not that things should be tit for that, but they should have been appreciative enough of that to return the consideration. Lastly... The Vegans could simply have pulled the \"hey sorry time ran over on us and I know it's bad but I wasn't able to make a soy free option do you mind ordering whatever you want from takeout on us again I am so sorry and feel terrible since you are the only one who takes our vegan lifestyle in consideration\" seriously acknowledge that someone goes out of their way and that would have diffused this whole thing.", "NTA !", "NTA", "NTA and damn that was bloody fantastic", "You may be surprised considering my username, but I'm on your side.
