But canceling the wedding seems way extreme. I'd be insanely upset and question my future spouse, but I'd definitely think it would not happen again after this huge scare.", "I love how you purposely left out that you were the only adult at the table at the time of ordering.

Why did this fall on you?", "Mixed judgment: YTA for forgetting, but NTA for causing their wedding to be called off. It wasn't you. It wasn't like you don't believe in allergies or thought it'd toughen him up or something stupid; you just forgot, which isn't great, but it happens. For it to blow up like this says there were bigger underlying issues at play and this just brought them forward. If it wasn't this, it would've been something else.

ESH. My question is the kid is 7 and has a severe allergy. This kid should be taught to ask and ask again. Ask when ordering. And double check when the meal comes out. Annoying? Yes, but is her allergy is as severe as it\u2019s made out to be it could save her life.  Now I\u2019m not going to pin this on the kid because she\u2019s a kid, but she should be speaking up if someone isn\u2019t.  We have been letting our kids choose their food for years. At 7 she should know what she likes and be communicating that unless she isn\u2019t capable. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin their wedding. As one mishap like this wouldn\u2019t wreck a solid relationship.

Some places really are just that fast.", "The kid's 7, cut her some kind of slack. It's a new dish she had clearly never had, and she's likely used to adults keeping peanut dishes away from her to begin with.\n\nEven schools go hard on peanut allergies. My entire 2nd grade class was sent home with a signature-required return note stating no peanut items could be packed in lunches and the kid was only allowed to eat lunch in a classroom under teacher supervision.", "She also conveniently left that out and later disclosed it in the comments \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ib0ku/aita_for_crying_causing_a_wedding_to_be_called_off/juta56l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3", "I just read about this allergy on another post the other night. I did not even know there was a sesame allergy and I use sesame oil in several dishes that I prepare on a regular basis. I have never asked anyone if they were allergic, and never told anyone it was in the food. I am thankful that no one has ever had a reaction while eating my food. As bad as Reddit can be sometimes, you can still learn things from it.", "Fun fact: Olive Garden's bread sticks have sesame in them. Pretty much everything else there is safe though! Found that out the hard way this week", "I knew a guy with a sesame allergy who would just straight up refuse to even *enter* Chinese or Cantonese restaurants. Just the tiny amounts of sesame oil aerosolised in the air would have him wheezing like Vader within seconds of entering.", "I ordered a pizza from a new place recently and nowhere was it written that they sprinkled sesame seeds on all their pizza crusts before baking. Would have REALLY annoyed me if I'd had a sesame allergy.", "Exactly! My MIL is also allergic to tree nuts, so I have to check so many things, especially coffee. Even coffee not branded as hazelnut, could have hazelnut as an added flavoring. Because of this, there are certain things I've written off to have in our home.", "I took a southwest flight and they announced that this was a special peanut free plane so don't ask for peanuts your getting pretzels.  Thought it was kinda cool the airline had a plane dedicated to being peanut free for those with extreme allergies.", "My daughter is severely allergic to salmon. One day my mother cooked salmon for lunch while my daughter was at school. She even aired the house out. My daughter ended up in anaphylactic shock in the ER. Just the oils from cooking certain foods can harm people. My daughter doesn\u2019t eat out at all.", "I believe it was an adult.", "Wait wait wait... I thought it was OP eating peanuts. She ordered it for the kid with the allergy?! Holy shit she could've killed them!", "Fifteen minutes is a long time to be in the bathroom though.", "My dad is allergic to sesame, my brother literally brought me a container of chili seasoning yesterday, because my dad couldn't use it because it has sesame in it. I'm allergic to flax, and you would not believe how much random shit has flax seed in it.", "I\u2019m the same. All of a sudden, after a lifetime of eating it regularly, one day I was allergic to broccoli (makes me vomit uncontrollably) but can still eat Brussels sprouts, cabbage, kohlrabi, all it\u2019s close relatives. I\u2019m a botanist so I know they\u2019re all essentially the same species, but I suspect it\u2019s some chemical that\u2019s concentrated in the buds on broccoli that causes the allergic reaction. \n\nIt\u2019s good to know that eliminating it from my diet was the right thing, as each time I tried to eat it the reaction became more and more intense. Don\u2019t want to wind up with an anaphylactic reaction, violent vomiting is bad enough!"]}
