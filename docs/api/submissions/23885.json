But canceling the wedding seems way extreme. I'd be insanely upset and question my future spouse, but I'd definitely think it would not happen again after this huge scare.", "I love how you purposely left out that you were the only adult at the table at the time of ordering.

Why did this fall on you?", "Mixed judgment: YTA for forgetting, but NTA for causing their wedding to be called off. It wasn't you. It wasn't like you don't believe in allergies or thought it'd toughen him up or something stupid; you just forgot, which isn't great, but it happens. For it to blow up like this says there were bigger underlying issues at play and this just brought them forward. If it wasn't this, it would've been something else.

ESH. My question is the kid is 7 and has a severe allergy. This kid should be taught to ask and ask again. Ask when ordering. And double check when the meal comes out. Annoying? Yes, but is her allergy is as severe as it\u2019s made out to be it could save her life.  Now I\u2019m not going to pin this on the kid because she\u2019s a kid, but she should be speaking up if someone isn\u2019t.  We have been letting our kids choose their food for years. At 7 she should know what she likes and be communicating that unless she isn\u2019t capable. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin their wedding. As one mishap like this wouldn\u2019t wreck a solid relationship.

YTA big time, and so is Anna. Alex explicitly told both you and Anna that Frankie has allergies, and nut allergies will end people's lives.

OP doesn't love this child as much as she claims to (or is just too careless to be trusted with a kid.)\n\nKiddo and the dad can't trust either of these women.
