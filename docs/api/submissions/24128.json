Not only was she this way at home but she also struggled in most aspects of her life.

We were constantly trying to work it out, some times easier than others, but eventually when our son was about 3 it clicked and now we have an incredibly healthy relationship and he is an amazing father and husband. She just cannot get over it.\n\n\nORIGINAL POST\n\nMy sister, (who I have an incredibly rocky relationship with), and her fianc\u00e9 have decided to have a destination wedding. I have two children (3 & 10) and one on the way, (due a couple of months before the wedding). She hates my husband from stuff occurred 10 years ago while we were VERY young and coparenting but she expected us ALL to be there.\n\nI was upfront from the beginning that I didn't think we could attend because of the price and the new baby. She gave us the final estimate and it would cost $7-8,000 for us to go. (Her and her fianc\u00e9 didn't even get us a card for our wedding). I ultimately told her we could not go. It was not feasible for our family. \n\nShe has refused to speak to me in 7 months. She speaks very poorly of us, sometimes in front of my children, but yet continues to try and have a relationship with my kids. She has even gone so far as to show up uninvited to my children's events and refuses to look or speak to me. It is incredibly uncomfortable and toxic for me to wrap my head around. \n\nBefore Father's Day, my dad told both of us he wanted for us to repair things, (I've done everything I can and attempted to reach out many times). She responded back with a HUGE text stating that me marrying my husband and having children has overshadowed her entire life because it takes the attention off of her and this was her wedding and time to shine and I have ruined the entire thing. This took things too far for me and I told her that because we have ruined her life so much she may not have a relationship with my children until she is able to attempt to repair our relationship and can find the help she needs to allow her to move forward with peace and positivity. \n\nMy dad, for the most part, understands. My mom does not. She helps watch the children and will do so when I start back up at work after the new baby. She has been sneaking my sister over and around the kids. I'm very put off and even more concerned about her bringing her around my new baby when we have virtually ZERO relationship anymore and she harbors such negative energy towards us. I have been thinking about taking my mom that if she can't respect my wishes, my children will only see my mom at my own house. It will not go well as previous conversations regarding my sister staying away have not gone to plan. \n\nAITA for keeping my sister from my kids?
