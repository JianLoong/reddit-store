She\u2019s lazy, nosy, a know it all, and lacks all social skills. Once Amy and I were debating about the best way to sear a steak when Nora injected herself into our conversation and tried to explain to us the exact method and type of pan to use. I didn\u2019t call her out but I silently asked myself what the hell does she know about cooking steak, she\u2019s a vegan. Another time Nora asked me about my 401k account and how much I have in it. Again, I was silently thinking to myself about how rude she was for asking about how much money I have in there (not much btw). No matter what you\u2019re talking about, she\u2019ll have something to say. Another time she was talking about dinosaurs for a good hour at dinner. We all just sat there (long after we were done eating) to be polite but no one talked because no one cared about dinosaurs and she never paused to take a breath to give anyone a chance to change the topic. Worst of all, she\u2019s a stay at home wife.\n\nNot a stay at home mom, they have no kids, a stay at home wife.

They\u2019re always short on the rent or don\u2019t have money for the utility bills or whatever. Last week Sam asked to borrow $50 for lunch for the week because he\u2019s short again. I love my kid brother but I had enough. I told him no and that he would have lunch money if his lazy wife works. We argued because he took offense at me calling her lazy. He later told Amy about our argument and she yelled at me for willing to let him go hungry. She loaned him the money.

She doesn't work at all, she is completely using your brother to fund her being able to go and have fun. She's not acting like a partner, if they both could afford to support themselves on them both working less than 40 hours a week, then they both could go to the beach and stuff like that. If she were actually his partner I don't know how she would be comfortable letting him work full time while she does nothing.\n\nOn the money front you do just need to make this your point to cut off.

So YTA on that one. \n\nJust going to tell you a case I have close to me, hope it helps. One of my best friend is neurodivergent and has anxiety. He can't Public speak, give a presentation or have an office type job, he literally tried thought school and in various jobs. He faints because of this and his blood pressure and general health was so bad they were thinking of having him stay in the hospital for a while. Outside, with us, going out, to parties, to the beach, he is the most calm person ever, he doesn't seem to have anxiety at all. One thing most people notice though is when he starts to talk about his favorite show, he can go on and on and on for HOURS. No one can get a word in. He is more careful about it now but back in the day it used to last a long ass time. Now he does work, from home, as a freelancer. He started doing some online courses to see what he liked and by the 3rd/4th one he got it, his niche (he still did little things with the other courses to get money). \n\nAll this to say, **she can most likely get a job and they need to find a solution, but you don't need to be shitty to her just because she is different than you.**", "YTA. \n\nTheir dynamic is none of your business.

Does he pay you back? You are right that you can't dictate how others live but you are also right that you shouldn't have to continually loan someone money because of their choices. Probably telling your brother his wife is lazy isn't the best comment. Maybe you should just tell him plain and simple that you can't help him anymore with living expenses because that is between him and his wife.

If it's an anxiety disorder it likely won't go away without meds and maybe not even then\n\nI have anxiety and work. I'm exhausted all the time even on my days off where I do nothing. I NEED to do nothing in order to recharge. Not only that but I cry. A lot. At work. Also call out and leave early. I hate it SO MUCH. \n\nI dont blame her for not working due to anxiety. God just the interview process led me to not even *try* for years due to the sheer panic it caused\n\nShe should still try at something tho. Something that doesn't trigger her anxiety so much", "Yeah, was going to say a lot of anxiety is situational, even when it is so bad it prevents a job. However if OP and his family is in the states, and Nora's anxiety is documented, she could qualify for disability. And if it's not documented, she should be seeing a doctor for it anyways, and get it documented.", "Nora is the reason there isn\u2019t enough money. Of course she was brought into it", "Was also thinking this. Sounds like she may be autistic. Would explain the bluntness and lack of social awareness. Maybe she\u2019s just trying her best to be apart of conversations? \n\nOP, you don\u2019t have to lend your brother money anymore. You can say no when you want. But YTA for the way you talk about his wife. You can disagree with their lifestyle all you want but it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s given you any true reasons to dislike her this much.", "Exactly. These are two unrelated issues. She's not the reason they don't have enough money--there could be a billion reasons they don't have money that doesn't have to do with Nora. You don't have to support anyone financially, but you also can't blame someone for something you can't confirm they did or didn't do just because you personally don't like them. I'd apologize to your brother, but tell your sister it's not your fault that your bro is hungry. You should probably slow down on shit-talking Nora.", "Yeah that's my question, like how are you all so close when you do not respect his wife? How is your brother so easily able to ask you for money? It doesn't sound like there's enough physical distance between y'all", "He earned the right to have an opinion the first time Sam came begging.", "What about all the insulting of his sister in law, and all the belittling of her condition?", "Sure, but for the question itself, OP is not obligated to give money.", "As someone with anxiety, I know how hard it can be sometimes to work, but if I knew my husband was going hungry because of my inability to contribute I would be getting creative. She can\u2019t make her own small business selling things, or get a part time work from home job? There are options to earn money in a less traditional setting.", "Her anxiety isn't everyone else's problem to support her. Anxiety or not she shouldn't be causing her husband to go hungry.", "Half of jobs right now are wfh. You don\u2019t even have to leave home. She\u2019s being lazy. If she had real medical diagnosis she\u2019d be able to get assistance and disability. She just doesn\u2019t want to work lol.", "As someone who is also a suspected an undiagnosed autistic there is a difference between someone who is just undiagnosed and someone who is just not proactive in their treatment  and is actively hurting themselves and their family", "This was my thought too", "As a diagnosed autistic it\u2019s still a NTA. \n\nAnxiety isn\u2019t a reason not to work and Nora is milking it so she can stay home. There are plenty of jobs she can do, she just doesn\u2019t want to", "He... He is 27yo...he's not a child. OP didn't make him go hungry, why is OP responsible for her brother?", "It\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault brother never has enough money.  He needs to figure out a budget and see why he doesn\u2019t have enough money for all of his bills and food.  If it\u2019s that he just doesn\u2019t have enough income he may have to get another job.  He\u2019s a grown adult who shouldn\u2019t have to borrow money every month", "They are full grown adults. Why should OP help with Nora\u2019s disability? They aren\u2019t children, they can do it themselves", "So anyone can just say they have \u201canxiety\u201d and you\u2019re supposed to bend over backwards for them and give their spouse money to support them?", "Shouldn't the couple take care of that? Why does OP have to accommodate SIL?", "He is supporting his brother and paying for her too.", "Ah yes. Jealous of a lazy wife that doesn\u2019t do anything. Totally/s", "I wouldn't for $50...once or twice. But a repeatedly pattern of relying on a sibling for rent or food money is not \"something petty\". It is failure to support yourself.\n\nOP is NTA for shutting the brotherly ATM down.", "How many times would you give them $50 before saying no?", "And that's brother's choice to make,  not OPs. Nothing wrong with not financing those life choices, as I said. But if brother is willing to do it, that's on him.", "I did things like ayahuasca and kambo to help with anxiety and depression and my anxiety came from being attacked but I decided I didn't want to become a prisoner of my anxiety and depression so I went to the extremes to resolve it", "Yes, an opinion on Sam. Not the wife. \n\nYou don\u2019t unilaterally decide to be a stay at home anything. That decision takes both parties. Sam had a say, and he is apparently fine with his wife staying at home. So where is Sam\u2019s judgment? \n\nEven further\u2026 \n\nThe wife didn\u2019t bother anyone for money. Sam did. Does it even say anywhere in the post that that the wife KNOWS that Sam asks to borrow money? What if she thinks their financial situation is fine? Like??? \n\n1) Sam is just as much at fault for not having enough finances. \n\nAnd 2) He is the one begging for money. Not his wife.", "Why is everyone acting like calling someone out for being lazy is like a big cardinal sin?", "If her condition is negatively affecting her spouse and their ability to live, she needs to look in to ways to cope better and contribute.", "depends if she really has a condition though. I think everyone knows someone who pretends to have a \"condition\". So we cannot judge those comments unless we know if she really has a condition or not.\n\n  \nMy mother works as a health aid and had a few patients who were just lazy and would pretend to not be able to do something, so that she would do it. She even caught one straight out on her lie after she mentioned she did some kind of sport even though she wasn't able to do those kind of activities with her pretended back pain - that's why she needed an aid after all.  \n\n\nSame with my neighbor who went for early retirement because he wasn't physically to work anymore - although he did a lot of physical work around the neighborhood...", "Her husband is adult and capable of making his own choices", "Real medical diagnosis is a privilege.\nYou need to have access to a doctor (I am guessing OP is in the US, and we all know how that system works).\nYou also need to be taken seriously, and western medicine has a pattern of ignoring women\u2019s concerns and dismissing their symptoms.\nSo the whole \u201cyOu nEeD a MeDiCal DiAgNoSiS\u201d needs to stop.", "Not true it cost a ton of money to even build the medical history to prove you have a mental health disorder that impacts your life enough to be considered disabled. It's not all that easy to even get disability payments", "Anxiety *is* a real medical diagnosis.", "Started thinking that when I read the second sentence. The dinosaur episode sealed the deal.", "I totally didn\u2019t say \u201cbend over backwards\u201d for someone who had anxiety. I said don\u2019t be an asshole. They are totally different, and op is being an asshole and diminishing mental illness. You putting anxiety in quotes is just as problematic.", "Because that's what families do; they look out for each other and help each other. \n\nIf OP doesn't want to help, fine, but he'll have to understand when he gets cut off from his brother.", "[deleted]", "So you basically used drugs (no judgement) you didn't work through it with a job like you said. The job didn't help you (though they can) the drugs did", "Because the way it sounds, it seems that OP can't understand the difference between laziness and a disability. People with disabilities are called lazy constantly by ableist people who refuse to understand.", "I think it's more likely that folks don't understand how certain conditions work. I know plenty of people that can stand up out of their wheelchairs and walk, but they cannot do it for long. If they try, they will collapse. People often see that and go \"they made it up. They made it up! I knew it! They just wanna be babied! They're getting something I don't get! It's not fair!\" \n\nWorking with people with disabilities, I see \"you're faking it!\" Accusations farrrrrr more than I see people actually faking it. Does it happen? Yes, but it's extremely rare. Most of the time, it's people not researching the parameters of their condition and not listening to the person's explanation of their own personal experience. \n\nAnd yeah, people with disabilities like to put their body to the test. It doesn't feel good to be limited by their body, feeling like a burden, so they often try to do helpful things with short bursts of energy/wellness they might have. I have a diabetic friend who walked on his effed up foot for 6 months, knowing it would eventually break, it hurt the whole entire time, and he just kept going. And then one day it did break and he spent 2 months dragging himself around his apartment on his hands and knees until it healed enough to walk. \n\nI think we should all retire from the business of telling others what their condition is.", "Still not OPs fault", "Because there\u2019s just as good a chance that she doesn\u2019t have any sort of mental health problems as she does. You giving her the benefit of the doubt with no basis for doing so is giving her a free pass and from the sounds of it, her life is made by free passes. \n\nIf she truly has mental health problems, she needs to get it diagnosed and treated. She could be collecting disability if she truly was disabled and this would life a huge burden off of OP and his brother.", "OP hasn't said his brother has paid him back at all.", "It was a combination of the 2 also kambo and ayahuasca are not drugs ... drugs suppress things these are amazonian plant based healing ceremonies ...its the very opposite of drugs"]}
