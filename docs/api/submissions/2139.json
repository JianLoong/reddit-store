She\u2019s lazy, nosy, a know it all, and lacks all social skills. Once Amy and I were debating about the best way to sear a steak when Nora injected herself into our conversation and tried to explain to us the exact method and type of pan to use. I didn\u2019t call her out but I silently asked myself what the hell does she know about cooking steak, she\u2019s a vegan. Another time Nora asked me about my 401k account and how much I have in it. Again, I was silently thinking to myself about how rude she was for asking about how much money I have in there (not much btw). No matter what you\u2019re talking about, she\u2019ll have something to say. Another time she was talking about dinosaurs for a good hour at dinner. We all just sat there (long after we were done eating) to be polite but no one talked because no one cared about dinosaurs and she never paused to take a breath to give anyone a chance to change the topic. Worst of all, she\u2019s a stay at home wife.\n\nNot a stay at home mom, they have no kids, a stay at home wife. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her physically to prevent her from working, she claimed she has anxiety that prevents her from working. I\u2019m not a doctor but I don\u2019t see any anxiety when she\u2019s shopping at Target or out at the beach during our family outings. Normally I wouldn\u2019t concern myself with Sam\u2019s family but it\u2019s affecting me.\n\nI don\u2019t see anything wrong with a one income family as long as that income can support that family. In Sam\u2019s case, his income can\u2019t support him and his wife. I\u2019ve had to loan him money at least a dozen times since he married Nora. They\u2019re always short on the rent or don\u2019t have money for the utility bills or whatever. Last week Sam asked to borrow $50 for lunch for the week because he\u2019s short again. I love my kid brother but I had enough. I told him no and that he would have lunch money if his lazy wife works. We argued because he took offense at me calling her lazy. He later told Amy about our argument and she yelled at me for willing to let him go hungry. She loaned him the money. I told her he needs to go hungry to see that his wife is a leech.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668282741, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytgmrj/aita_for_letting_my_brother_go_hungry_to_make_a/", "score": 2296, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn't work at all, she is completely using your brother to fund her being able to go and have fun. She's not acting like a partner, if they both could afford to support themselves on them both working less than 40 hours a week, then they both could go to the beach and stuff like that. If she were actually his partner I don't know how she would be comfortable letting him work full time while she does nothing.\n\nOn the money front you do just need to make this your point to cut off.

So YTA on that one. \n\nJust going to tell you a case I have close to me, hope it helps. One of my best friend is neurodivergent and has anxiety. He can't Public speak, give a presentation or have an office type job, he literally tried thought school and in various jobs. He faints because of this and his blood pressure and general health was so bad they were thinking of having him stay in the hospital for a while. Outside, with us, going out, to parties, to the beach, he is the most calm person ever, he doesn't seem to have anxiety at all. One thing most people notice though is when he starts to talk about his favorite show, he can go on and on and on for HOURS. No one can get a word in. He is more careful about it now but back in the day it used to last a long ass time. Now he does work, from home, as a freelancer. He started doing some online courses to see what he liked and by the 3rd/4th one he got it, his niche (he still did little things with the other courses to get money). \n\nAll this to say, **she can most likely get a job and they need to find a solution, but you don't need to be shitty to her just because she is different than you.**", "YTA. \n\nTheir dynamic is none of your business.

Does he pay you back? You are right that you can't dictate how others live but you are also right that you shouldn't have to continually loan someone money because of their choices. Probably telling your brother his wife is lazy isn't the best comment. Maybe you should just tell him plain and simple that you can't help him anymore with living expenses because that is between him and his wife.

That's an obvious lack of empathy coming from OP and imo that's the bigger problem here, not SIL's neurodivergence. Ableism is a really bad look for anyone, but especially expressing *open contempt* about something she very clearly does not understand or care to understand. Oof.\n\nAnd honestly, what SIL does is none of OP's fucking business. ND people are allowed to enjoy shopping or going to the beach. Like most other people who have mental or physical health issues, we are capable of masking in front of other people and looking \"fine\". Enjoying time at Target or the beach doesn't mean a person can't have anxiety. And what does anxiety \"look like\" anyway? It looks like the person picking out canned beans next to you at the grocery store, or the person driving their kids to school, or the person crossing the street, or the person delivering your pizza, or your coworker, or in this case the woman happily waltzing through Target and frolicking on the beach. My point is that you don't know what it looks like because 1. it could be anyone, 2. people can often mask in public, 3. unless you're also ND you probably can't see what's really going on, and 4. *IT'S NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS OP*.\n\nIt sounds more like jealousy that SIL doesn't work and can enjoy Target and the beach while OP's life is presumably stressful. But guess what? *Neurodivergence is also fucking stressful*, because we have to exist in a world designed by and for neurotypical people, where we have to constantly accommodate neurotypicals or get treated like OP is treating SIL. Just because it seems like we have an easy life doesn't mean it's easy. Not working is just as stressful as working, and I say this as someone with a PhD who used to work and now can't due to disability. It's a different kind of stress, but still just as traumatizing. Also, have you ever had to live paycheck to paycheck and have to borrow money just to eat? Traumatizing af, and I wouldn't be surprised if your brother doesn't tell his wife about the state of their finances to not stress her out. Not saying that's right, but don't assume that she can just find a job or that she even knows about the financial problems because it's almost certainly more complicated than that. Your brother is with her for a reason even if you don't understand it so do them both a favor and keep your nose where it belongs, *which isn't inserting yourself into their relationship or insulting your SIL because she's different and you don't like it*.\n\nYTA OP.

Your SIL is a whole ass person with feelings just like you and you're not just infantilizing her, you're openly insulting her for a neurodivergence she was born with. It's like making fun of an amputee in a wheelchair because they don't have legs. Abhorrent behavior on your part. Don't loan money if you don't want to, but don't make it about you because it's not about you. Let your SIL live in peace.

Especially the dinosaur bit.", "This is a very simplistic take on disability and it doesn't usually work like this. At the very least, it's usually incredibly difficult to do the things you suggest she \"would be able to do\". I'm not saying this to be combative, just to educate because most people do not realize what a shitshow it is. \n\nGetting a diagnosis can be a huge challenge, especially for afab people. I was misdiagnosed bipolar for two decades before testing finally revealed that nope, I'm actually autistic and ADHD. I can't tell you how many times I was told I'm making it up for attention, or it's all in my head, or I just need to do xyz (like yoga, lolno), or you just need to suck it up like everyone else when *your nervous system is literally wired differently and \"sucking it up\" isn't a thing because of how your brain is wired*. My experience is heartbreakingly common in the ND community, so please don't assume that SIL has the right diagnosis or can even get a doctor to take her seriously. OP's description of SIL's behavior is classic autism and most afab autistic people are late diagnosed, assuming they can get a diagnosis at all. It's a longer conversation, but suffice it to say the vast majority of clinicians are not qualified to diagnose afab autism, it's difficult to find qualified clinicians who will take adult patients, and assessments are not usually covered by insurance and cost $$$$. Mine was nearly $3k and I'm privileged enough that my insurance paid for some of it and I could afford the rest. I also had to travel out of state just to find a qualified clinician. \n\nSecond, you're assuming that SIL is eligible for any kind of social benefits. In the US that would be things like SSI/SSDI or SNAP. You have to meet very strict and often punishing criteria to qualify for those. In the case of SNAP it's financial eligibility, but with SSI/SSDI the *easy part* is meeting the financial eligibility criteria or having enough work credits. It can be exceedingly difficult to qualify for the disability/health side of things *even if you are absolutely, unquestionably disabled and unable to work*. This is especially true if you're younger than about 50 years old. There are millions of people in the US who would benefit from having a disability income but don't qualify because they either don't have enough work credits, are worth too much on paper despite having very little cash flow, they don't have the ability to get necessary medical documentation to apply for disability, they don't have doctors who will back them up (which is often because they don't want to deal with the paperwork, not because their patient isn't actually disabled), they don't have the time/energy/money to devote to the application and evaluation process (which is insane, by the way), and then there's the problem with SSI/SSDI income being far less than what is needed to live on *unless your work history involves a well paying job*, because SSDI payments are based on how much money you've made as an adult. \n\nThen there's the assumption that these resources exist at all or that they are readily and easily accessible, which they aren't for reasons outlined above. Abled people tend to think there are far more resources available than actually exist, or that the application process is simple and if you don't get approved, well, you're not disabled. *The system is intentionally designed to benefit as few people as possible*, so even if you DO need access to that resource that doesn't mean you can GET access to it. \n\nAs for nontraditional sources of income, well, you're simplifying that too. Etsy is a hot mess. Having to actively market your wares is a hot mess. You're assuming that not only does SIL have a skill/craft that people will buy, but also that she will be able to find customers. I make and sell jewelry and art and oh boy, it's a fucking *nightmare* unless you already have a big social media following. Let's be honest here, that doesn't describe most people.\n\nBabysitting? You're assuming she has the ability to do that, not from a cognitive standpoint but from an autism/ND standpoint. Many of us can't tolerate being around children for sensory reasons. Plus, childcare is a LOT of work. If she can't work a \"traditional\" job, what makes you think she can handle the rigors of childcare?\n\nDog walking again assumes a lot of things about her disability, things you don't know about. Autism affects every facet of your life and if she's got anxiety bad enough she can't work, she may not be able to handle the sensory hell that walking dogs can be. Also assumes she's got no physical disabilities, which are often comorbid with autism for genetic reasons like disabling autoimmune or connective tissue diseases.\n\nWork from home is ideal for a lot of autistic people, but again, finding those opportunities and then navigating the application/hiring process is a nightmare for autistic people. It's a huge part of the reason why the majority of autistic people can't work, plus all the other things neurotypical people take for granted like being able to filter out distractions or not having as many sensory sensitivities. These issues are still a problem at home. \n\nI don't disagree that the husband is in denial, but can we please not throw his wife under the bus for having a disability? And let's please not oversimplify what are very complicated issues that autistic people face, like finding employment or accessing needed resources. I wish it was as simple as \"hey you're disabled, here are some resources to help support yourself, let us know if you need any more help\" but it's not.", "Came here to say exactly that. \n\nThe dinosaur soliloquy sealed it for me.", "Sorry, but you can\u2019t just armchair diagnose autism in order to give Nora a pass for not pulling her weight", "As an autistic person this is exactly what I was thinking.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking when it was mentioned that Nora lacks social skills and talked about dinosaurs for an hour.

Shopping on your own, or with your spouse or a friend is not the same as having to talk to dozens of strangers every day because you're working as a cashier. Not to mention being on your feet for hours on end. And having to perform small-talk and work a cash register/do basic math in front of strangers in a timely manner.", "Being poor and unemployed is not the kind of life everyone wants to have. It's also not fun.", "And women are frequently under diagnosed as well! Lots of psychological professionals feel more comfortable diagnosising a woman with anxiety or depression then shoe horn the rest of their symptoms into that rather than looking at the root of it and trying to figure out where the symptoms stem from. It's why a *lot* of women drop out of college when they were honors students and coasted through school all their life without studying but suddenly start to fail their college classes. Teachers see little boys talk about a special interest for an hour and will report it to the school, who will then contact the parents to get the child tested. Teachers see little girls talk about a special interest for an hour and think she's chatty. A girl who avoids eye contact is shy, a boy who avoids it gets tested. It's even worse if the child isn't white", "Thank you for this. I was diagnosed with ADHD in my early twenties. Currently I'm not working due to my mental and physical health.

Also OPs descriptors def hint at ADHD too. In my experience neurotypicals will think of ADHD people as annoying but think of autistic people as weird. \n\nI do hope she gets the help she needs. She does need to get a job but there\u2019s no chance she will if she doesn\u2019t even know that she has ADHD and it\u2019s having this much of an impact on her. And I would hope that everyone involved would take the time to learn more about her situation and neurodivergence in general to turn this into a productive moment for everyone.", "Thank you! It was the hour talk about dinosaurs that made me go \"sounds NT\"", "I went in for ADHD testing at the ripe old age of 33 (F) and at some point I got distracted and started gushing to the psychologist about how much I liked foreign language grammar (she asked what my hobbies were)...and that's when she added some autism evals to the pile, lol.\n\nI usually don't speak at length on any of my particular interests because I've been rejected too many times, but her question caught me at an anxious, talkative moment.", "Idk maybe I\u2019m just being a dick but I dont think OP did anything wrong.", "I would call it realistic, not negative. That's the experience of many autistics (and other disabilities) including myself, otherwise I'd have a stable income instead of having to rely on the kindness of others.\n\nConsider yourself lucky that you don't have to deal with these problems and try to see things from our perspective. Disability can be debilitating and often removes from consideration pretty much all the possible solutions you suggested. I DO focus on the things I CAN do, just like every other disabled person does.\n\nThe fact that this looks negative to an abled person just means you don't have to face these challenges yourself. Sometimes the reality is that you CAN'T be self sufficient and it really fucking sucks, but that's how society is designed. Your disability decides your limits not your brain and if you don't respect them you end up worse off than you were to begin with. We don't always have options to be self sufficient when we have to live within our limits.", "I know, it's crazy. To give perspective, I'm in Portland, OR. I think gala apples would be cheaper, I was just trying to average it out between all the apples. Different varieties cost different prices per lb. I think Honey Crisp is at 2.99/lb right now, and they're bigger than ever. 3 large apples is a good $5-6.", "You think that\u2019s bad come to Hong Kong 1 fiji apple is \u00a31.08 .

I used to pay less than a $1 a pound for apples in season (so like 0.20-0.30 per apple) where I used to live but when we moved cross country this summer the price of fruits and vegetables doubled.", "Also some people get kicked off their benefits if they even live with their romantic partner (unmarried)", "That's SSI. If she has work credits, you can get SSDI and it's not dependent on spousal income.", "So she can\u2019t work at all. She can\u2019t work from home. My best friends wife has Ehkers Danlos. She runs a business. I get that Disability can be invisible. Sure. So it might be worth it among family to make that issue transparent rather than sit around, pontificate, and borrow money.", "Yep. My mom was denied just because my dad has a decent-paying job (and I think it was also because she doesn't constantly go to the doctor for every single thing). Just because my dad makes okay money doesn't mean they can afford everything they need. Plus, his job is really physically demanding, and he has a lot of pain too and can't just cut back on hours or whatever.", "Yeah, and they want to see you constantly going to the doctors for issues if you're trying to get on disability. I think this is one of the reasons my mom was denied, because she's the sort to power through the pain, even though it's bad, and she doesn't like to take a lot of my dad's money, so she just refuses to go unless she has to.", "OP has given no indication of a disability, and even if she is ND, there are plenty of people with autism who work and are good at their jobs. I find it hard to believe that there is not one single job out there that Nora could do so that her spouse wouldn\u2019t starve and have to beg family for money all the time. Spare me with the anti-work agenda. A societal construct where no one was expected to work would be an utter failure, no matter how primitive.", "From the way OP described the SIL in the opening paragraphs it just sounded like someone trying to join in on a conversation and going on a long tangent, without realizing theyre being rude or being looked down on. It honesrly sounds like she's either trying hard to fit in with sisters that have 0 interest in having her be a part of the convo and/or she's neurodivergent.", "He didn\u2019t say she was lecturing. He said in a debate about how to cook steak she also had an opinion. And that every time there\u2019s a conversation she tries to join in. And that once she talked at length about dinosaurs when no one tried to change the subject or stop her. \n\nThen he accuses her lying about a medical diagnosis, which is a super AH move. I mean, even when trying to make her look bad he comes off looking worse.", "Yeah, for all we know there are plenty of in-budget things for him to take for lunch from home.  With him asking for $50 for a week of lunches, I'm guessing he likes to eat out.", "It could be a few different things. My partner has a personality disorder that gets mistaken as autism and ADHD. It just seems like OP is assuming she\u2019s lazy when in actuality she may not want to get into it or may not understand why work is difficult for her. She may be able to get disability which could help their financial situation quite a bit.", "Imagine telling someone in a wheelchair that they should walk bc they were able to take a few steps to get to the bathroom. It's the same thing. Shame has never helped anyone. Period", "Where I am (TX), for some reason, grapes are STUPID expensive.  Like $4+ a pound.", "I'm in the midwest, so quite a bit cheaper. I wasn't questioning your figures, just pointing out that it can easily be much less.", "Would Nora even be eligible for SSDI, though? For someone her age, the SSA requires work credits for \"half the time since you started working and the time your disability began,\" which could make her ineligible based on the recent work test. Then there's also the curveball of when they believe she \"became\" disabled \u2013 if she is autistic, which is present by early childhood, she wouldn't be considered \"recently disabled\" (which complicates the matter of work credits) and her marriage would mean she's likely ineligible for Disabled Adult Child SSDI payments.", "You realize both autism and EDS vary in severity, right? Some people can run businesses, some can\u2019t function without outside help, some are in between or it depends on the circumstance.\n\nShrugging it off like that is really demeaning to people who struggle *so hard* just to live an average life and always feel behind the curve. \n\nAs far as OP, I have no idea what\u2019s going on with his SIL. But I know being forced to disclose any medical issues simply because his family doesn\u2019t like her isn\u2019t the move. \n\nOP can loan money or not, but her life/health isn\u2019t up for his business.", "Just so you know\u2026 humans have only required people to work in relatively recent centuries.

While her family struggles.", "I thought so too. What she's doing sounds like she just misses the social cues. And anxiety is also a legitimate reason why working outside home is difficult for her.

There is an apple type on sale at a different grocer for $1.78/lb and they are sold in 4lb bags. Bananas are $0.50/lb.", "Because the US is huge, so apples are still in season somewhere, and their fuel costs are cheaper than ours.  Here apples have just gone out of season now so they have to be shipped in, with fuel at 2 euros a litre, and subidised farming keeping prices artificially high (to protect farmers) etc all adds up to fresh fresh food costing more here in France. In all fairness though, in a lot of countries (US and UK included) supermarkets sell fruit that is quite bland and tasteless, particularly apples, which is not the case in France.", "Haha yes, I gotcha. I didn't take offense at all, it's just crazy how prices range based on location, and I'm sure your minimum wage is less there in the Midwest.

Like the other posters have said, look up \"food desert\"-", ">That makes paying them to not grow food at all seem sensible in comparison.\n\nNot really. It's an ongoing problem with agriculture.  You want to have a generous surplus, in case something affects the crop, so there isn't famine if things go wrong.\n\nBut that then drives down prices, because supply exceeds demand.  And farmers go broke.\n\nThe USDA doesn't generally throw out the surplus.  It gets given to the poor, (think \"government cheese\") or sent overseas to places where there is a food shortage.  Used for things like school lunches. \n\nFor example, I'm sure, right now Ukraine is getting a decent amount of US food, and so are places in the Middle East and Africa that have generally bought their grain from Ukraine but have had supplies disrupted by the war.\n\n\"We want a food surplus, and we want farmers to make a living, which means supply shouldn't exceed demand and drive prices down.\"   You can't have both, unless there is some type of sensible government intervention.", "*Rainier\nwhere are you?
