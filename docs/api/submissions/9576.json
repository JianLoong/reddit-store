{"id": 9576, "submission_id": "10y8sds", "title": "AITA For Not Wanting The Biological Father Of My Child To Say Who He Really Is?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (30f) have a \"Mike\" (4m) who was fathered by my old college boyfriend \"Jason\" (31m) who ghosted me before I was able to tell him that I was pregnant. When I first found out that I was pregnant it was around finals, Jason and I were in grad school, and Jason was so stressed out his exams, work, and family issues that I decided to tell him after his last exam. Also, because I had a bad habit of procrastinating when I get anxious and a part of me was in denial about being pregnant.\n\nI admit that during this time I was acting out of the ordinary and being a little secretive. Unfortunately Jason got the wrong idea and (insert a series of curse words) friend \"Amanda\" (30f) convinced him I was cheating so when I came back to our apartment he was gone. He posted an awful message about me on social media and then blocked me, so did most of our mutual friends along with all of his family members. I was devastated and desperate, so desperate that I even swallowed my pride and reached out to Amanda to beg him to talk to me.\n\nShe then proceeded to taunt me and then sent me a screenshot of Jason's text calling me a liar and pathetic for trying to pass off another man's baby as his. I tried reaching out to Jason once during the later half of my pregnancy and another time after Mike was born before giving up. I tried to go the court's way but Jason got a job overseas so it was what it was.\n\nLater I met \"Dan\" (36m) he was great, we fell in love, got married and was willing to adopt Mike. Shortly after I had my second child Jason reached out to me. The very first thing he did was offer a sincere and meaningful apology to me said that he now realized that Amanda lied to him and that the evidence she had against me was false. Jason also said that Amanda was the one who interceded my attempts to reach out to him and knew that I had had his son.\n\nI did not hold back my anger and he took it. He gave me a few days to cool down before reaching out to me and asking to meet Mike. After discussing it with Dan, we agreed and Jason was introduced to Mike as \"mommy's friend from college\" since then he's met Mike in person about four times, I've sent him a few pictures, and even let him video chat a few times. Recently Jason reached out to me about wanting to know when we'd tell Mike that he was his \"real\" father and I countered back that Dan was his real dad as he was the one who was helping me raise him, and that he could either be \"Uncle Jason\" or nothing at all.\n\nJason got upset and pointed out how it wasn't his fault that he wasn't apart of Mike's life, that he's trying now, and how his family wants to meet him. I countered that if he hadn't of ghosted me he wouldn't be in this situation right now and in the eyes of the law he doesn't get say. Dan agrees that Mike may be too young right now but feels it's wrong to keep Jason out all together, so AITA?\n\nEdit: Because someone asked just to be clear Dan is now the legal father of Mike.\n\nI'm not sure about all the legal terms but basically when Dan and I started the adoption process we had our lawyers send out a notice to Jason's last known legal address (which Amanda intercepted) and then after no response we petitioned the court and cited abandonment so that Jason's rights would be terminated since Dan was present and willing to take Mike on.\n\nEdit 2: I don't know why people are thinking this but just to be clear Dan and I would never NOT tell Mike about biological parentage I'm just not willing to do it now. I don't want to risk my son becoming emotionally attached to a man with a history of ghosting. Dan has proven to be reliable, Jason has not. I'm planning on telling Mike somewhere between 13-18.  \n\n\nEdit 3: Since someone DM me, while Jason's story of Amanda tricking him is plausible with the details he gave me, I honestly don't believe him since it's too convenient of an excuse and he hasn't shown me any indisputable proof.", "created_utc": 1675982862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y8sds/aita_for_not_wanting_the_biological_father_of_my/", "score": 2548, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's going to find out the truth at some point. It will be less traumatic for him if you're honest with him now. Jason's also going to have to accept that he made some choices that put him in the situation he's in. He chose to believe Amanda's lies and it may have cost him his relationship with his kid.

If Dan legally adopted Mike, then you are well within your rights to tell Jason to pound sand. \n\nThat said there are age appropriate ways to tell your son he's adopted and it's much better for him if do it now. Especially since Jason's back and could potentially tell him in a way that will be confusing and damaging.  There are far too many stories about adoptees finding out and then resenting their parents for lying to them or completely cutting off their adoptive parents in favor of their bio families.", "> Jason reached out to me about wanting to know when we'd tell Mike that he was his \"real\" father\n\nOh, nope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Jason got upset and pointed out how it wasn't his fault that he wasn't apart of Mike's life\n\nAs you point out, that's simply untrue. He decided to believe a lie & go completely no contact for nearly 5 years. \n\nNTA & while husband is correct that eventually you need to tell Mike who his biological father is, Jason needs some major attitude adjustment before he should be allowed any role in Mike's life.", "NTA\u2026**BUT**, I advise that you start making a plan to tell Mike sooner than adolescence. Speak with a therapist. They should be able to help guide you. If you wait until Mike is old enough to realize you LIED to him about his biological father for a decade or more, he may never forgive you\u2026and you may lose him. \n\nSeek guidance from others who have been adopted, too.", "NTA, Dan is Mike\u2019s real father. I would suggest that 13-18 is a bit too old to find out he\u2019s adopted, especially since Mike will probably spill the beans before then. But you should tell him when your family is ready.", "NTA for not wanting him to reveal your son's true paternity, but the younger your son is when he learns the truth, the easier it will be for him to accept it and live with that knowledge. The older a child gets the more difficult it becomes for them to process and accept the who, the whys and the how.", "NTA\n\nDan legally adopted Mike. Jason had multiple chances between the pregnancy and when your lawyers sent him paperwork regarding the adoption to step up and be a parent. He chose to instead ignore all attempts to contact, he does not get to be upset now that he has no parental role in your sons life.\n\nI do think you need to tell Mike way sooner than later. I had a friend who parents didn't tell her she was adopted until she was 14 and to say she was upset is an understatement.", "NTA - If Jason had the SLIGHTEST interest in being a father, he would have cancelled his plan to work overseas all this time.  He cant blame that on Amanda.  Your husband is now dad to both kids end of story.  Jason is unreliable", "NTA. While I agree with other commenters that your timeline on when to tell him isn\u2019t what\u2019s best for Mike, I have a hard time seeing how you owe anything to Jason after how one-sided the last five years or so have been.", "NTA.\n\nAt the same time, I do think it\u2019s better to tell him earlier then later. I work touch base with child therapist to untangle this, especially since your son now knows him as an uncle figure.\n\nHe\u2019s doesn\u2019t need to take on the role of father for your son to understand that they are biologically related.", "NTA.  You need to explain to Mike that Jason is his bio father at some point, and sooner might be better, but remind him that Dan is and will always be his dad.  Kids can grasp these type of things pretty well if parents are open about them.  Explaining it when they are younger and don't care much about biology I think is the best way to go.", "NTA...your husband is his legal father. I hope someday you can tell him that Jason is the sperm donor, but he has never been in Mike's life. He doesn't get to show up years later throwing his weight around. You've been nice enough to allow him in your son's life, but again you son already has a father. Good luck OP.\n\nEdit: out of curiosity, was Amanda in live with him? Were they ever together? How could she be so vile?", "NTA, he is your child and your partner's child, You two are the only ones that have a say right now, since Mike really is too young to grasp this. Maybe you should give Jason some of his own medicine and ghost him back. Keeping him in Mike's life is not feasible, if he does not want to understand he is only the sperm donor and without rights.", "NTA.\n\nIt is 100% Jason's fault that he was not a part of Mike's life. He abandoned you and your son, without even considering the truth. And he now has no legal rights either, as the court has correctly judged.", "NTA - BUT I do think you've made some mistakes here, I need to reckon with the fact that Jason is going to be a part of your son's life in some form or another even if it is only in the form of rejection and abandonment\n\nThe ideal option here is for Jason to be in your son's life in the form of an actual living human being who loves him and spends time with him. the worst case scenarios are him rejecting and abandoning your son or being abusive.\n\nhere are the considerations re Jason and I would HIGHLY highly suggest thinking all this thorough, talking with him extensively, and made mediation or group therapy\n\n\n1 - Jason isn't just talking about explaining to your son that he's the bio dad. He's dismissing Dan's role as your child's father and trying to replace that and that's not ok and is incredibly toxic \n\nThis is 100% not ok and Jason needs to consider what kind of relationship he wants with Mike because if he actively tries to replace your child's father that likely to be extremely distressing for Mike and I'm guessing you and Dan won't want him in Mike's life \n\nYou and Dan are Mike's parents, Jason is not. Was this unfortunate wording or expressing how he truly sees the situation? You need to have a long talk with him about this\n\n2. it's genuinely not your fault Jason didn't know, and him trying to make this your fault and pretending he's blameless is extreme. He was so unavailable and unresponsive that his parental rights were terminated and Mike was legally adopted by another man\n\nBest case scenario is that Amanda really did have access to his phone and faked text messages and intercepted his mail. But if that's the case he has no one to be angry at other than Amanda and himself. And there's a good chance that some of this story isn't true\n\nEven in the best case scenario where it was all Amanda, he still went to extreme extreme lengths to ghost you, moving out without telling you. He blocked you on everything and had all of your mutuals and all of his family do so too, making it essentially impossible for you to contact him. That's nuclear level shit. \n\nHe's aged and hopefully matured, but it's not wrong to want him to prove consistency and that he can trusted in stressful situations. What happens if you tell your child now and Mike starts to bond more with Jason and Jason gets angry about something and vanishes again\n\nIntroducing anyone to a child's life like this you want to trust that the person is stable and consistent, Jason's history makes that more important\n\n3. Your son has only met Jason a few times and it sounds like Jason hasn't been around very long. You're wrong to want to wait until your child is teenager, but Jason is also pushing this very very very soon. Parents hiding the truth of their children's origins until the children are more grown up generally doesn't go well. It makes the child feel betrayed and lied to, even if it's only a lie of omission. However there's a big difference between your son's current age and being a teenager and waiting longer now is fine\n\n(edit: fine on the basis of age alone. the fact that Jason can preempt you on this front makes waiting till your son is 5 or 6 risky in this situation. That's not too late to ordinarily tell a child but may be in this case. I'd still follow your plan of getting a therapist for Mike but initiate that plan NOW. asap. and get the therapists advice on when to tell him and how)\n\n4. Mike is going to have questions. Why didn't Jason want me? Why am I only meeting him now? Have you thought through how that will go? Has Dan? Has Jason? All the adults need to get on the same page as to what story he's going to be told. So far in the brief time Jason has been back in your life, he's avoided taking responsibility for his actions and tried to shift blame. What happens when you tell Mike the truth and he has questions for Jason and Jason isn't emotionally mature enough to take responsibility?? That plus Jason insisting that Dan isn't Mike's real father. Those are two big red flags, and I would be deeply concerned about what he plans to say or imply to Mike, especially if you or Dan are not around\n\n5. You need to think long and hard about the options and how they'll impact your son. If Jason refuses to be \"Uncle Jason\" and storms off and never sees Mike, what happens when he's older and you tell him the truth about his birth? When you tell him that Dan adopted him, he's going to ask about his birthfather. Are you going to tell him who he is? If not there's a good chance that he will guess or try to find out on his own  \n\nHow are you going to explain that he met his birth father when he was four but then didn't see him after that? Your son is going to feel rejected, and there's a good chance he might blame you for some of that\n\nEven if Jason had never come back and the story was that he ghosted you - your son might very well want to contact him himself  \n\nRegardless of your personal feelings towards Jason, he is always going to be a part of your son's life in some form or another. Whether that form is rejection and abandonment or an actual human being who is present in his life and loves him.... that is not entirely up to you. But you will play a big role. You should absolutely be protecting your child and you have good reasons to be concerned, but there's many other ways your child can get hurt in this scenario and Jason walking away is absolutely one of them", "NTA\n\nNo part of what this guy did to you is right, and he doesnt deserve anything.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nYou need to talk to a child psychologist/therapist to determine what's best for your son, and the best way to approach it. This isn't one of those parenting things where you can wing it.", "no judgement but a suggestion from a parent with a family of kids from adoption - find a good therapist now and do some good research and find good resources to help your son learn and understand about his biological background now - waiting until they are in throes of teen hood that l is such a difficult time already - could be very very hard on them.", "INFO: \n\nWhen are you certain he knew? Can you confirm he knew prior to the adoption? Can you confirm he sent that text to Amanda? Either way Amanda is the AH here. I won't pass judgement on you or Jason because you were both manipulated. \n\nYou opted not to tell him in person when you had the chance,  whether your reasons were valid or not, so don't make the mistake with your son. You have to tell him sooner rather than later. If he finds out in 5 or 10 years, it won't end well. Right now, you have fairy tales and magic on your side because they believe anything at 4 and you'd be surprised how well you can word stuff. Make Jason prove that he isn't going anywhere, find a therapist and frame it in a way he can understand.", "Jason was kept in the dark about Mike. He might get his parental rights back.  He is the bio dad, that carries a lot I of weight. He did not abandon Mike.", "Treat it like anyone would an open adoption. NTA.", "ESH, leaning more towards Jason than you, OP.\n\n I think your anger towards Jason is totally justified. He was an AH.  He left you alone and vulnerable at a very crucial time, and he trusted an outsider more than you, his partner. I can't imagine how painful and scary that was. I also understand that you are scared about him dipping out again and hurting your son. \n\nHowever, YWBTA if you don't tell your son about his biological father sooner rather than later. Waiting until he is 13-18 to tell him is a TERRIBLE idea. Although he may be older then, those years are fraught with enough resentment and rebellion towards parents that you don't want to throw gasoline on that particular fire. If you gradually introduce \"Mike\" to the idea that Dan adopted him when he was a baby now, it will seem normal and not some big secret. Then, you can decide how/when to tell him that Jason is his biological father. I would encourage you to talk to a family counselor about how best to bring these things up with your son and make it part of your family narrative. There's nothing shameful about \"Mike\"'s story, and if you treat it that way, it will lessen the trauma.", "NTA.  Mike's dad had several opportunities to make it right.  He's a grown man.  He should have had a paternity test to make sure 100% before leaving.  The whole Amanda thing is a non-issue because again Jason is grown.  I would speak to a counselor or therapist, but I don't think Mike needs to know that just now.  I do believe he should know later because he deserves to know who his biological father is, but he's young and that's confusing.  To any man reading this, for the love of God get a paternity test.", "NTA. Yes, you should have told him sooner, but he chose to take someone else\u2019s word over yours and didn\u2019t make any attempt whatsoever to hear your side or ask for a paternity test. It literally was his fault. Amanda could have told him anything or showed him whatever fake evidence she could come up with, but the truth was easily provable if he cared enough to find out. Just because he wants to be a father now doesn\u2019t change the fact that he already had the opportunity to be this kid\u2019s dad and threw it away. He\u2019s not this kid\u2019s dad, he\u2019s the sperm donor. Jason is unreliable at best and has already proved to be fickle and shortsighted, along with easily manipulated and ultimately unreliable. He needs to prove himself if he wants a relationship with Mike, he isn\u2019t entitled to one after he abandoned him.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nJason showed you what he was, so you owe him no special favors. When you tell Mike, you do it on your terms. Whatever role you allow Jason in Mike's life is up to you and Mike's dad, not Jason.\n\nI do agree with the many here who say you should tell Mike soon. Secrets have a way of spilling out, so trying to put off the discussion may actually be harmful. You need to take control so Mike hears the story gently. This would probably a good time to talk about different kinds of families.", "NTA, he did his best (or Amanda did? seems a little suspicious that she managed to intercept every single time) to remove himself, so why should he get to dictate his return?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, like other commenters, I would suggest introducing the idea of adoption or of him being adopted so you're covered if Jason gets a chance to tell him or if Mike finds out in another unplanned way. I am a preschool teacher, and it can be really beneficial to introduce a book about a hard topic to start a conversation. You don't even have to tell him that *he,* specifically is adopted but just casually adding a book about it to your household could be helpful in the long run. I don't have any recommendations off the top of my head but I'm sure Google or even another Reddit comment has some ideas. Good luck!", "NTA - but I do you think you should take into consideration all the people here who are commenting how traumatic it was to find out their biological parentage at an older age. I would definitely look into a specialised counsellor/therapist and take their advice. Don't make it about Jason and his needs. this is about your son and his needs.", "NTA BUT OH MY GOD DON'T WAIT TILL 12-18!! the kid should know. why on earth would you lie to your kid for that long? get him a counselor NOW and speak to them about it.", "NTA. Mike has a right to know, but that doesn\u2019t mean Jason has any right to claim hold to the title Dad. Mike already has a dad that loves him. Uncle is being gracious towards Jason considering he abandoned not only you, but also your son. \n\nYou can tell Mike age appropriate truths. He doesn\u2019t need to know Jason is his biological dad right now. Id recommend getting some children\u2019s books about blended families to help open him up to the idea that family doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019re related. A children\u2019s therapist would be beneficial, they can guide you through what is helpful information for Mike to have, and guide him through processing it.", "YTA, As an adoptee with adopted kids, please don't wait.  You tell him so that he always knows, and you explain it in a way that is developmentally appropriate.  You are asking for a world of trouble springing this on him later in life.  It is absolutely, one hundred percent, the wrong thing to do. Your husband is daddy, legally, morally and emotionally.  But you are not required to provide visitation and should probly explain to ex that his behavior is causing concern and that you need some distance to explain and decide how to go forth.  He has no say and needs to be grateful for whatever crumb you throw him.\n\nIf you need help with ways to explain, I will gladly give you some ideas based on his age.", "NTA- you have a right to protect your son from being abandoned and he has to prove himself. What is wrong is trying to deny his right as a father you can tell him when he\u2019s 5-10 otherwise your son will be mad you\u2019ve been willingly lying not to mention what his real father will tell him.", "NTA. But you need to start talking to Mike now in case \u2018uncle Jason\u2019 runs his mouth", "NTA.  Jason is going to tell Mile on his own if things keep up.  Go no contact with that dude and let Mike decide when you tell him.", "YWBTA if you didn't tell your son who his real biological father is. You would also be the AH if you didn't allow him to have some sort of relationship with him. He's 4, you can start easing that into his life now. I was adopted by my Dad when I was 2 and I don't remember ever not knowing the truth, and my bio-dad had no interest in having a relationship with me. \n\nDon't keep his Dad away because of your feelings about this situation.\n\nI had a friend in high school who found out at 18 years old that his adopted Dad wasn't his bio-dad. He was devastated and furious that he wasn't told before. He considered dropping out of school to get a job so he could move out of his parent's house.\n\nPlease do not keep this a secret from this baby, it will destroy him down the road and he will resent you for it.", "NTA definitely. There's a whole lot of ifs, buts, maybes, shouldst and shouldn't being thrown at you in here but I think there's only actually 2 things to consider.\n\nYou've been shown the law and it seems to me, although I'm uk based, that Jason doesnt have any available argument in his favour over rights to be involved as a father, straightforward enough. \n\nHope uou don't mind  I'm going to DM something.", "NAH (except for Amanda, who is a massive asshole). I can see both points of view here. The unfortunate truth is that these sorts of things have a way of coming out, especially with things like ancestry DNA tests. You're setting yourself up for failure down the line.", "Jason is 31 but he was in college 4 years ago?\n\nAnd how did Amanda \u201cintercept\u201d the attorney\u2019s letter?", "Straight up not a question for Reddit. Get all adults involved together and talk to a family/child psychologist to discuss how to handle this without traumatizing your son.\n\nEdit: ESH, except Mike.", "YWBTA if you don't tell your son, before he becomes a teenager, that Jason is his bio-dad especially if you are allowing Jason around him now. Jason may end up telling Mike himself. If you tell Mike, you can control the narrative. You say you are worried about him being hurt if Jason ghosts but I think a romantic rlp (like you two had) is quite different from a father-son rlp so ghosting may not even end up applying. Plus, I think if Mike founds out as a teen about this whole thing he could end up resenting you and Dan and running to Jason.", "Jason needs to take this up with Amanda.\n\nHe says it\u2019s not his fault but it certainly isn\u2019t yours, Dan\u2019s or Mike\u2019s.\n\nNTA. Mike\u2019s too young to be told that this other guy is his Dad", "ESH. I don\u2019t know if Mike is telling the truth about why you haven\u2019t been able to get in contact with him but you can\u2019t allow him to be in your son\u2019s life as an uncle. Experts agree that adopted children should grow up knowing the full history of their parentage. If you tell your son now he\u2019ll have few questions and that will be the end of it. If you wait until he\u2019s is older, he\u2019ll be in shock, have a full on identity crisis and wonder if he can really trust the adults around him. The only reason you want to withhold this information is because you\u2019re not ready to share it. This isn\u2019t about what\u2019s best for you, it\u2019s about what\u2019s best for him.", "ESH - it's obvious why Jason is an AH, but you should probably contact the attorney who did the adoption to figure out if Jason can overturn it based on lack of personal jurisdiction/service of process. You may not actually long term be legally in the position to prevent them from having a relationship. 13-18 is waaaaaay too old to tell a kid about their biological parentage, you should start now in an age appropriate fashion so the information will not be a huge surprise in the future. And really if it turns out that the adoption isn't kosher it's very possible that Jason will somehow be in your son's life for the long haul and you need to figure out how to deal with that in a way that is in the best interest of your son.", "ESH. Jason absolutely sucks for how he treated you. He should have requested a DNA when it was first a question, not 4+ years later. But what\u2019s done is done. For the record though Jason is his biological father not his \u201creal\u201d father since he hasn\u2019t been the one raising him and being a father to him.

He\u2019s there for himself. \n\nHe knew what he was doing, and I wouldn\u2019t trust him. He is not your kids father, Dan is.

It\u2019s generally considered next to impossible to get custody of a child you\u2019ve signed away your rights to, based on what little googling I\u2019ve managed to do, so take that with a grain of salt. But I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any wiggle room if it was done in absentia. You need to talk to a lawyer and make sure that there\u2019s no way he can fight this later if he establishes a relationship with your son now. Know your legal rights and, if deemed necessary, set some legal parameters before you let Jason keep seeing Mike. \n\nSecond, find a child psychologist now and get an expert opinion on how/when to bring up adoption with your son. There could be a way to start off now in a child friendly way with little detail. For example, you don\u2019t have to say, hey Mike, husband is your dad but Jason is your bio dad. You can start off with one of those kids books that talks about all the different ways families are made up. Tell him that while husband is his dad, another person helped make him so that you and husband could be a family. I don\u2019t know exactly how or what the best way to go about this is, that\u2019s what the shrink is for lol. But you can do this without mentioning Jason at all and then decide at a later date whether to let him know about Jason specifically.  Given other people\u2019s experiences on this thread it sounds like it might be best to broach this sooner rather than later. \n\nBut, like I said, first thing is to protect you and your son. Go see that lawyer and set some strong boundaries with Jason. Make a detailed plan now. Outline everything you think you would and wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with if Jason stays in Mike\u2019s life, and make sure that Jason knows and agrees to it. At this point he has absolutely no rights, but the more you let him form a relationship with Mike, the more complicated things will get later if you don\u2019t have a plan in place now for how you\u2019ll handle all eventualities. To be clear, I\u2019m not saying to keep Mike from Jason. That\u2019s a decision to make with your husband and lawyer. I\u2019m just saying that this difference of opinion between you two will not be the last if you don\u2019t come up with some guidelines now for the future. And Jason needs to know that, as the legal parents, what you and husband say, goes.", "You\u2019re NTA, tell him when he\u2019s a teenager. It\u2019s not fair to your husband.

He\u2019s reaping what he sowed years ago with his actions then; his future involvement depends on his actions now. \n\nI would talk to a therapist now (as opposed to later) about how to tell Mike. As others have pointed out, it will likely be easier if he grows up always knowing this information than having his core identity shaken later. I would also speak with your lawyer again just to make sure there isn\u2019t anything you need to be cautious of doing that would open the door to a battle over parental rights.

I do suggest telling your son when when he is about 5 or 6 so he has no real resentment or trauma over it though. Only other thing I could suggest: If the bio dad claims he is telling the truth and never knew anything, he should pursue legal action against Amanda for intercepting his texts/mail. If he he has screenshots/etc. like he said he does, he may have all sorts of legal recourse for what happened here if true. \n\nBut like you said, this is all bs and sounds so convenient, I doubt that to be true.

When I first found out that I was pregnant it was around finals, Jason and I were in grad school, and Jason was so stressed out his exams, work, and family issues that I decided to tell him after his last exam. Also, because I had a bad habit of procrastinating when I get anxious and a part of me was in denial about being pregnant. \n\nI admit that during this time I was acting out of the ordinary and being a little secretive. Unfortunately Jason got the wrong idea and (insert a series of curse words) friend \"Amanda\" (30f) convinced him I was cheating so when I came back to our apartment he was gone. He posted an awful message about me on social media and then blocked me, so did most of our mutual friends along with all of his family members. I was devastated and desperate, so desperate that I even swallowed my pride and reached out to Amanda to beg him to talk to me. \n\nShe then proceeded to taunt me and then sent me a screenshot of Jason's text calling me a liar and pathetic for trying to pass off another man's baby as his. I tried reaching out to Jason once during the later half of my pregnancy and another time after Mike was born before giving up. I tried to go the court's way but Jason got a job overseas so it was what it was. \n\nLater I met \"Dan\" (36m) he was great, we fell in love, got married and was willing to adopt Mike. Shortly after I had my second child Jason reached out to me. The very first thing he did was offer a sincere and meaningful apology to me said that he now realized that Amanda lied to him and that the evidence she had against me was false. Jason also said that Amanda was the one who interceded my attempts to reach out to him and knew that I had had his son. \n\nI did not hold back my anger and he took it. He gave me a few days to cool down before reaching out to me and asking to meet Mike. After discussing it with Dan, we agreed and Jason was introduced to Mike as \"mommy's friend from college\" since then he's met Mike in person about four times, I've sent him a few pictures, and even let him video chat a few times. Recently Jason reached out to me about wanting to know when we'd tell Mike that he was his \"real\" father and I countered back that Dan was his real dad as he was the one who was helping me raise him, and that he could either be \"Uncle Jason\" or nothing at all. \n\nJason got upset and pointed out how it wasn't his fault that he wasn't apart of Mike's life, that he's trying now, and how his family wants to meet him. I countered that if he hadn't of ghosted me he wouldn't be in this situation right now and in the eyes of the law he doesn't get say. Dan agrees that Mike may be too young right now but feels it's wrong to keep Jason out all together, so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We've heavily explained that a Daddy is the person who does the work, gets all the good and the bad, puts them first, and loves their child no matter what.

I loathed both of them for years. This damaged our relationship for a long long time. Only in my 30s did I come to forgive them and trust them again and they were very loving parents. This is not going to play out how you think it will and I urge you to reconsider. Tell him now. Do not lie to him about who he is and who the people in his life are.

I found out in my early twenties that the toddler was actually my half-brother. Dad cheated on my stepmom with her best friend. I have a half-sister (from the stepmom) who is 2 months older than the toddler I didn't know was my brother. \n\nNow knowing my dad like I do, I wasn't terribly shocked to learn that the kid I used to play with was my brother. However, it really made me think about whether this big secret was to protect me and my siblings or if it was adults trying to avoid explaining their messy behavior. To this day, my dad refuses to acknowledge that my brother is his son, despite the fact that my brother is a spitting image of our dad. There's definitely resentment there, and it's well-deserved. \n\nI'm hoping you can avoid all that hot mess for Mike's sake.

Because he deserves to hear it from you, and i know people who are adopted and they have all said it felt like a terrible betrayal to them because they somehow always \"felt\" something was off about their parents, and had many internal questions wondering why the youngest 3 kids were blond hair blue eyes and they were olive skin brown eyes. But then later they find out and sometimes the cut is so deep it doesnt heal.\n\nSo i hope you will consider telling him that his biological father is jason but your husband is his legal parent.   I also hope you will consider at least allowing jason's parents to be a part.of his life, they had no part in ghosting you.  A child cant have too many people loving them and i hope you will allow him that.   Of course before you do, you should check into the legalities and see what if any rights jason or his parents have.  If you do allow them  to get to know him, it could turn out well if they are good people.\n\nI believe if you dont allow them to be a part.of jason's life that your son will heavily resent you when he is a teenager and learns he missed out on 14 yrs of time w his biological dad & family, as well as feeling terribly betrayed.\n\nI cannot imagine how you are feeling, but if you tell him the truth now and start allowing him to spend bits of time with them that it could be a good thing.

Amanda is an awfully convenient scape goat, how did she have so much weight so he takes no responsibilities, did Jason come back and not even ask for a paternity test was he that sure now that there was shared DNA, did his parents find out and THEY want a relationship which triggered his action.

Some responses on this post treat Jason as though he's someone who can just be kept away with no consequences, but he has family, relatives, possibly a wife and more children someday, and Mike won't be a child forever. So long as his circle knows that Mike exists, someone will contact him and Jason's side will be heard eventually.

They were gone for four years and he had a dad, and his dads family so they won\u2019t get major holidays and if there is drama, or they scare your son, or overwhelming him, or are inconsistent they\u2019ll be cut off for good. They have zero legal rights. This is kindness from you, but your child\u2019s needs are all that matter to you do their adult feelings should be dealt with, with a therapist because your ONLY priority is the well being of your child and the moment you suspect that the relationship isn\u2019t good for him, you\u2019re done.\n\nMy take is, the more adults in a kids life that care about him in a healthy way, the better.

He knew there was a baby and that there was a chance he was the father. And he still decided to skip town without checking it out.\n\nAlso, are you 100 % he was acting in good faith back then? Maybe he just didn't want the responsibility of having a child and that's why he was so happy to claim it wasn't his?\n\nI also wonder what made him change his opinion years later.

As for when to tell him, see if Jason will wait a year. You don\u2019t want him ghosting you anymore than you want him rushing to tell your son before you do, but a year should give you time to observe his behavior and see if he seems trustworthy, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too long for Jason to wait.", "I doubt that he\u2019ll take legal action against the adoption because his so-called story has too many holes.

Great insight.", ">A 4 year old is ironically much more resilient and adaptable. You need to let him grow up knowing the truth not lie to him for years and then suddenly reveal that you were hiding the truth from him.\n\nThis is actually a very good point.

You and Dan need to work through your disagreements, whatever they are, so that when and if Jason enters the room you two are shoulder to shoulder and unbreakable.

If not then has this particular post triggered you in anyway? You are literally arguing against what OP says happened, why?", "This!!! 100% this!!! This isn't about Mike, it's about pushing off an uncomfortable conversation. Every single comment from people who found put they were adopted are saying to tell Mike NOW. By telling him now, even if Jason leaves again, Mike has now established his trust with his parents (OP and Dan) to be honest and stay with him and show that they will be consistent in his life.

No, that stinks of manipulation and lies. Totally would not trust someone who acts like that. \n\n Trying to get us to believe that his friend \u2018Amanda\u2019 somehow prevented him is such a cheap lie and cop out.

I agree with the comment you replied to\u2014if Jason flakes, it\u2019ll hurt the kid more knowing that\u2019s his bio dad and bonding with him before he leaves. If they wait to tell him for a bit, it gives Mike time to process that the dad who raised him isn\u2019t his bio dad and time to figure out what questions he wants to ask about that, and then whether or not Jason sticks around, they can explain his bio parentage once Mike has adjusted to the first bit. But the process should absolutely start now."]}
