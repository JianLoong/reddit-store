{"id": 9576, "submission_id": "10y8sds", "title": "AITA For Not Wanting The Biological Father Of My Child To Say Who He Really Is?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (30f) have a \"Mike\" (4m) who was fathered by my old college boyfriend \"Jason\" (31m) who ghosted me before I was able to tell him that I was pregnant. When I first found out that I was pregnant it was around finals, Jason and I were in grad school, and Jason was so stressed out his exams, work, and family issues that I decided to tell him after his last exam. Also, because I had a bad habit of procrastinating when I get anxious and a part of me was in denial about being pregnant.\n\nI admit that during this time I was acting out of the ordinary and being a little secretive. Unfortunately Jason got the wrong idea and (insert a series of curse words) friend \"Amanda\" (30f) convinced him I was cheating so when I came back to our apartment he was gone. He posted an awful message about me on social media and then blocked me, so did most of our mutual friends along with all of his family members. I was devastated and desperate, so desperate that I even swallowed my pride and reached out to Amanda to beg him to talk to me.\n\nShe then proceeded to taunt me and then sent me a screenshot of Jason's text calling me a liar and pathetic for trying to pass off another man's baby as his. I tried reaching out to Jason once during the later half of my pregnancy and another time after Mike was born before giving up. I tried to go the court's way but Jason got a job overseas so it was what it was.\n\nLater I met \"Dan\" (36m) he was great, we fell in love, got married and was willing to adopt Mike. Shortly after I had my second child Jason reached out to me. The very first thing he did was offer a sincere and meaningful apology to me said that he now realized that Amanda lied to him and that the evidence she had against me was false. Jason also said that Amanda was the one who interceded my attempts to reach out to him and knew that I had had his son.\n\nI did not hold back my anger and he took it. He gave me a few days to cool down before reaching out to me and asking to meet Mike. After discussing it with Dan, we agreed and Jason was introduced to Mike as \"mommy's friend from college\" since then he's met Mike in person about four times, I've sent him a few pictures, and even let him video chat a few times. Recently Jason reached out to me about wanting to know when we'd tell Mike that he was his \"real\" father and I countered back that Dan was his real dad as he was the one who was helping me raise him, and that he could either be \"Uncle Jason\" or nothing at all.\n\nJason got upset and pointed out how it wasn't his fault that he wasn't apart of Mike's life, that he's trying now, and how his family wants to meet him. I countered that if he hadn't of ghosted me he wouldn't be in this situation right now and in the eyes of the law he doesn't get say. Dan agrees that Mike may be too young right now but feels it's wrong to keep Jason out all together, so AITA?\n\nEdit: Because someone asked just to be clear Dan is now the legal father of Mike.\n\nI'm not sure about all the legal terms but basically when Dan and I started the adoption process we had our lawyers send out a notice to Jason's last known legal address (which Amanda intercepted) and then after no response we petitioned the court and cited abandonment so that Jason's rights would be terminated since Dan was present and willing to take Mike on.\n\nEdit 2: I don't know why people are thinking this but just to be clear Dan and I would never NOT tell Mike about biological parentage I'm just not willing to do it now. I don't want to risk my son becoming emotionally attached to a man with a history of ghosting. Dan has proven to be reliable, Jason has not. I'm planning on telling Mike somewhere between 13-18.  \n\n\nEdit 3: Since someone DM me, while Jason's story of Amanda tricking him is plausible with the details he gave me, I honestly don't believe him since it's too convenient of an excuse and he hasn't shown me any indisputable proof.", "created_utc": 1675982862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y8sds/aita_for_not_wanting_the_biological_father_of_my/", "score": 262, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's going to find out the truth at some point. It will be less traumatic for him if you're honest with him now. Jason's also going to have to accept that he made some choices that put him in the situation he's in. He chose to believe Amanda's lies and it may have cost him his relationship with his kid. He's been MIA for 4 years. That's abandonment. It's not like he never knew about the pregnancy. He's not innocent here.", "What kind of man ghosts his girlfriend for cheating instead of confronting her for the truth. He was looking for an excuse.

If Dan legally adopted Mike, then you are well within your rights to tell Jason to pound sand. \n\nThat said there are age appropriate ways to tell your son he's adopted and it's much better for him if do it now. Especially since Jason's back and could potentially tell him in a way that will be confusing and damaging.  There are far too many stories about adoptees finding out and then resenting their parents for lying to them or completely cutting off their adoptive parents in favor of their bio families.", "> Jason reached out to me about wanting to know when we'd tell Mike that he was his \"real\" father\n\nOh, nope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Jason got upset and pointed out how it wasn't his fault that he wasn't apart of Mike's life\n\nAs you point out, that's simply untrue. He decided to believe a lie & go completely no contact for nearly 5 years. \n\nNTA & while husband is correct that eventually you need to tell Mike who his biological father is, Jason needs some major attitude adjustment before he should be allowed any role in Mike's life.", "NTA\u2026**BUT**, I advise that you start making a plan to tell Mike sooner than adolescence. Speak with a therapist. They should be able to help guide you. If you wait until Mike is old enough to realize you LIED to him about his biological father for a decade or more, he may never forgive you\u2026and you may lose him. \n\nSeek guidance from others who have been adopted, too.", "NTA, Dan is Mike\u2019s real father. I would suggest that 13-18 is a bit too old to find out he\u2019s adopted, especially since Mike will probably spill the beans before then. But you should tell him when your family is ready.", "NTA for not wanting him to reveal your son's true paternity, but the younger your son is when he learns the truth, the easier it will be for him to accept it and live with that knowledge. The older a child gets the more difficult it becomes for them to process and accept the who, the whys and the how.", "NTA\n\nDan legally adopted Mike. Jason had multiple chances between the pregnancy and when your lawyers sent him paperwork regarding the adoption to step up and be a parent. He chose to instead ignore all attempts to contact, he does not get to be upset now that he has no parental role in your sons life.\n\nI do think you need to tell Mike way sooner than later. I had a friend who parents didn't tell her she was adopted until she was 14 and to say she was upset is an understatement.", "NTA - If Jason had the SLIGHTEST interest in being a father, he would have cancelled his plan to work overseas all this time.  He cant blame that on Amanda.  Your husband is now dad to both kids end of story.  Jason is unreliable", "NTA. While I agree with other commenters that your timeline on when to tell him isn\u2019t what\u2019s best for Mike, I have a hard time seeing how you owe anything to Jason after how one-sided the last five years or so have been.", "NTA.\n\nAt the same time, I do think it\u2019s better to tell him earlier then later. I work touch base with child therapist to untangle this, especially since your son now knows him as an uncle figure.\n\nHe\u2019s doesn\u2019t need to take on the role of father for your son to understand that they are biologically related.", "NTA.  You need to explain to Mike that Jason is his bio father at some point, and sooner might be better, but remind him that Dan is and will always be his dad.  Kids can grasp these type of things pretty well if parents are open about them.  Explaining it when they are younger and don't care much about biology I think is the best way to go.", "NTA...your husband is his legal father. I hope someday you can tell him that Jason is the sperm donor, but he has never been in Mike's life. He doesn't get to show up years later throwing his weight around. You've been nice enough to allow him in your son's life, but again you son already has a father. Good luck OP.\n\nEdit: out of curiosity, was Amanda in live with him? Were they ever together? How could she be so vile?", "NTA, he is your child and your partner's child, You two are the only ones that have a say right now, since Mike really is too young to grasp this. Maybe you should give Jason some of his own medicine and ghost him back. Keeping him in Mike's life is not feasible, if he does not want to understand he is only the sperm donor and without rights.", "NTA.\n\nIt is 100% Jason's fault that he was not a part of Mike's life. He abandoned you and your son, without even considering the truth. And he now has no legal rights either, as the court has correctly judged.", "NTA - BUT I do think you've made some mistakes here, I need to reckon with the fact that Jason is going to be a part of your son's life in some form or another even if it is only in the form of rejection and abandonment\n\nThe ideal option here is for Jason to be in your son's life in the form of an actual living human being who loves him and spends time with him. the worst case scenarios are him rejecting and abandoning your son or being abusive.\n\nhere are the considerations re Jason and I would HIGHLY highly suggest thinking all this thorough, talking with him extensively, and made mediation or group therapy\n\n\n1 - Jason isn't just talking about explaining to your son that he's the bio dad. He's dismissing Dan's role as your child's father and trying to replace that and that's not ok and is incredibly toxic \n\nThis is 100% not ok and Jason needs to consider what kind of relationship he wants with Mike because if he actively tries to replace your child's father that likely to be extremely distressing for Mike and I'm guessing you and Dan won't want him in Mike's life \n\nYou and Dan are Mike's parents, Jason is not. Was this unfortunate wording or expressing how he truly sees the situation? You need to have a long talk with him about this\n\n2. it's genuinely not your fault Jason didn't know, and him trying to make this your fault and pretending he's blameless is extreme. He was so unavailable and unresponsive that his parental rights were terminated and Mike was legally adopted by another man\n\nBest case scenario is that Amanda really did have access to his phone and faked text messages and intercepted his mail. But if that's the case he has no one to be angry at other than Amanda and himself. And there's a good chance that some of this story isn't true\n\nEven in the best case scenario where it was all Amanda, he still went to extreme extreme lengths to ghost you, moving out without telling you. He blocked you on everything and had all of your mutuals and all of his family do so too, making it essentially impossible for you to contact him. That's nuclear level shit. \n\nHe's aged and hopefully matured, but it's not wrong to want him to prove consistency and that he can trusted in stressful situations. What happens if you tell your child now and Mike starts to bond more with Jason and Jason gets angry about something and vanishes again\n\nIntroducing anyone to a child's life like this you want to trust that the person is stable and consistent, Jason's history makes that more important\n\n3. Your son has only met Jason a few times and it sounds like Jason hasn't been around very long. You're wrong to want to wait until your child is teenager, but Jason is also pushing this very very very soon. Parents hiding the truth of their children's origins until the children are more grown up generally doesn't go well. It makes the child feel betrayed and lied to, even if it's only a lie of omission. However there's a big difference between your son's current age and being a teenager and waiting longer now is fine\n\n4. Mike is going to have questions. Why didn't Jason want me? Why am I only meeting him now? Have you thought through how that will go? Has Dan? Has Jason? All the adults need to get on the same page as to what story he's going to be told. So far in the brief time Jason has been back in your life, he has blamed you for something that is not your fault and that he needs to take responsibility for. And he's insisted that Dan isn't your child's real father. Those are two big red flags, and I would be deeply concerned about what he plans to say or imply to Mike, specially if you or Dan are not around\n\n5. You need to think long and hard about the options and how they'll impact your son. If Jason refuses to be \"Uncle Jason\" and storms off and never sees Mike, what happens when he's older and you tell him the truth about his birth? When you tell him that Dan adopted him, he's going to ask about his birthfather. Are you going to tell him who he is? If not there's a good chance that he will guess or try to find out on his own  \n\nHow are you going to explain that he met his birth father when he was four but then didn't see him after that? Your son is going to feel rejected, and there's a good chance he might blame you for some of that\n\nEven if Jason had never come back and the story was that he ghosted you - your son might very well want to contact him himself  \n\nRegardless of your personal feelings towards Jason, he is always going to be a part of your son's life in some form or another. Whether that form is rejection and abandonment or an actual human being who is present in his life and loves him.... that is not entirely up to you. But you will play a big role. You should absolutely be protecting your child and you have good reasons to be concerned, but there's many other ways your child can get hurt in this scenario and Jason walking away is absolutely one of them", "NTA\n\nNo part of what this guy did to you is right, and he doesnt deserve anything.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nYou need to talk to a child psychologist/therapist to determine what's best for your son, and the best way to approach it. This isn't one of those parenting things where you can wing it.", "no judgement but a suggestion from a parent with a family of kids from adoption - find a good therapist now and do some good research and find good resources to help your son learn and understand about his biological background now - waiting until they are in throes of teen hood that l is such a difficult time already - could be very very hard on them.", "INFO: \n\nWhen are you certain he knew? Can you confirm he knew prior to the adoption? Can you confirm he sent that text to Amanda? Either way Amanda is the AH here. I won't pass judgement on you or Jason because you were both manipulated. \n\nYou opted not to tell him in person when you had the chance,  whether your reasons were valid or not, so don't make the mistake with your son. You have to tell him sooner rather than later. If he finds out in 5 or 10 years, it won't end well. Right now, you have fairy tales and magic on your side because they believe anything at 4 and you'd be surprised how well you can word stuff. Make Jason prove that he isn't going anywhere, find a therapist and frame it in a way he can understand.", "Jason was kept in the dark about Mike. He might get his parental rights back.  He is the bio dad, that carries a lot I of weight. He did not abandon Mike.", "Treat it like anyone would an open adoption. NTA.", "ESH, leaning more towards Jason than you, OP.\n\n I think your anger towards Jason is totally justified. He was an AH.  He left you alone and vulnerable at a very crucial time, and he trusted an outsider more than you, his partner. I can't imagine how painful and scary that was. I also understand that you are scared about him dipping out again and hurting your son. \n\nHowever, YWBTA if you don't tell your son about his biological father sooner rather than later. Waiting until he is 13-18 to tell him is a TERRIBLE idea. Although he may be older then, those years are fraught with enough resentment and rebellion towards parents that you don't want to throw gasoline on that particular fire. If you gradually introduce \"Mike\" to the idea that Dan adopted him when he was a baby now, it will seem normal and not some big secret. Then, you can decide how/when to tell him that Jason is his biological father. I would encourage you to talk to a family counselor about how best to bring these things up with your son and make it part of your family narrative. There's nothing shameful about \"Mike\"'s story, and if you treat it that way, it will lessen the trauma.", "NTA.  Mike's dad had several opportunities to make it right.  He's a grown man.  He should have had a paternity test to make sure 100% before leaving.  The whole Amanda thing is a non-issue because again Jason is grown.  I would speak to a counselor or therapist, but I don't think Mike needs to know that just now.  I do believe he should know later because he deserves to know who his biological father is, but he's young and that's confusing.  To any man reading this, for the love of God get a paternity test.", "NTA. Yes, you should have told him sooner, but he chose to take someone else\u2019s word over yours and didn\u2019t make any attempt whatsoever to hear your side or ask for a paternity test. It literally was his fault. Amanda could have told him anything or showed him whatever fake evidence she could come up with, but the truth was easily provable if he cared enough to find out. Just because he wants to be a father now doesn\u2019t change the fact that he already had the opportunity to be this kid\u2019s dad and threw it away. He\u2019s not this kid\u2019s dad, he\u2019s the sperm donor. Jason is unreliable at best and has already proved to be fickle and shortsighted, along with easily manipulated and ultimately unreliable. He needs to prove himself if he wants a relationship with Mike, he isn\u2019t entitled to one after he abandoned him.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nJason showed you what he was, so you owe him no special favors. When you tell Mike, you do it on your terms. Whatever role you allow Jason in Mike's life is up to you and Mike's dad, not Jason.\n\nI do agree with the many here who say you should tell Mike soon. Secrets have a way of spilling out, so trying to put off the discussion may actually be harmful. You need to take control so Mike hears the story gently. This would probably a good time to talk about different kinds of families.", "NTA, he did his best (or Amanda did? seems a little suspicious that she managed to intercept every single time) to remove himself, so why should he get to dictate his return?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, like other commenters, I would suggest introducing the idea of adoption or of him being adopted so you're covered if Jason gets a chance to tell him or if Mike finds out in another unplanned way. I am a preschool teacher, and it can be really beneficial to introduce a book about a hard topic to start a conversation. You don't even have to tell him that *he,* specifically is adopted but just casually adding a book about it to your household could be helpful in the long run. I don't have any recommendations off the top of my head but I'm sure Google or even another Reddit comment has some ideas. Good luck!", "NTA - but I do you think you should take into consideration all the people here who are commenting how traumatic it was to find out their biological parentage at an older age. I would definitely look into a specialised counsellor/therapist and take their advice. Don't make it about Jason and his needs. this is about your son and his needs.", "NTA BUT OH MY GOD DON'T WAIT TILL 12-18!! the kid should know. why on earth would you lie to your kid for that long? get him a counselor NOW and speak to them about it.", "NTA. Mike has a right to know, but that doesn\u2019t mean Jason has any right to claim hold to the title Dad. Mike already has a dad that loves him. Uncle is being gracious towards Jason considering he abandoned not only you, but also your son. \n\nYou can tell Mike age appropriate truths. He doesn\u2019t need to know Jason is his biological dad right now. Id recommend getting some children\u2019s books about blended families to help open him up to the idea that family doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019re related. A children\u2019s therapist would be beneficial, they can guide you through what is helpful information for Mike to have, and guide him through processing it.", "YTA, As an adoptee with adopted kids, please don't wait.  You tell him so that he always knows, and you explain it in a way that is developmentally appropriate.  You are asking for a world of trouble springing this on him later in life.  It is absolutely, one hundred percent, the wrong thing to do. Your husband is daddy, legally, morally and emotionally.  But you are not required to provide visitation and should probly explain to ex that his behavior is causing concern and that you need some distance to explain and decide how to go forth.  He has no say and needs to be grateful for whatever crumb you throw him.\n\nIf you need help with ways to explain, I will gladly give you some ideas based on his age.", "NTA- you have a right to protect your son from being abandoned and he has to prove himself. What is wrong is trying to deny his right as a father you can tell him when he\u2019s 5-10 otherwise your son will be mad you\u2019ve been willingly lying not to mention what his real father will tell him.", "NTA. But you need to start talking to Mike now in case \u2018uncle Jason\u2019 runs his mouth", "NTA.  Jason is going to tell Mile on his own if things keep up.  Go no contact with that dude and let Mike decide when you tell him.", "YWBTA if you didn't tell your son who his real biological father is. You would also be the AH if you didn't allow him to have some sort of relationship with him. He's 4, you can start easing that into his life now.

He considered dropping out of school to get a job so he could move out of his parent's house.\n\nPlease do not keep this a secret from this baby, it will destroy him down the road and he will resent you for it.", "NTA definitely. There's a whole lot of ifs, buts, maybes, shouldst and shouldn't being thrown at you in here but I think there's only actually 2 things to consider.\n\nYou've been shown the law and it seems to me, although I'm uk based, that Jason doesnt have any available argument in his favour over rights to be involved as a father, straightforward enough. \n\nHope uou don't mind  I'm going to DM something.", "NAH (except for Amanda, who is a massive asshole). I can see both points of view here. The unfortunate truth is that these sorts of things have a way of coming out, especially with things like ancestry DNA tests. You're setting yourself up for failure down the line.", "Jason is 31 but he was in college 4 years ago?\n\nAnd how did Amanda \u201cintercept\u201d the attorney\u2019s letter?", "Straight up not a question for Reddit. Get all adults involved together and talk to a family/child psychologist to discuss how to handle this without traumatizing your son.\n\nEdit: ESH, except Mike.", "YWBTA if you don't tell your son, before he becomes a teenager, that Jason is his bio-dad especially if you are allowing Jason around him now. Jason may end up telling Mike himself. If you tell Mike, you can control the narrative. You say you are worried about him being hurt if Jason ghosts but I think a romantic rlp (like you two had) is quite different from a father-son rlp so ghosting may not even end up applying. Plus, I think if Mike founds out as a teen about this whole thing he could end up resenting you and Dan and running to Jason.", "Jason needs to take this up with Amanda.\n\nHe says it\u2019s not his fault but it certainly isn\u2019t yours, Dan\u2019s or Mike\u2019s.\n\nNTA. Mike\u2019s too young to be told that this other guy is his Dad", "ESH. I don\u2019t know if Mike is telling the truth about why you haven\u2019t been able to get in contact with him but you can\u2019t allow him to be in your son\u2019s life as an uncle. Experts agree that adopted children should grow up knowing the full history of their parentage. If you tell your son now he\u2019ll have few questions and that will be the end of it. If you wait until he\u2019s is older, he\u2019ll be in shock, have a full on identity crisis and wonder if he can really trust the adults around him. The only reason you want to withhold this information is because you\u2019re not ready to share it. This isn\u2019t about what\u2019s best for you, it\u2019s about what\u2019s best for him.", "ESH - it's obvious why Jason is an AH, but you should probably contact the attorney who did the adoption to figure out if Jason can overturn it based on lack of personal jurisdiction/service of process. You may not actually long term be legally in the position to prevent them from having a relationship. 13-18 is waaaaaay too old to tell a kid about their biological parentage, you should start now in an age appropriate fashion so the information will not be a huge surprise in the future. And really if it turns out that the adoption isn't kosher it's very possible that Jason will somehow be in your son's life for the long haul and you need to figure out how to deal with that in a way that is in the best interest of your son.", "ESH. Jason absolutely sucks for how he treated you. He should have requested a DNA when it was first a question, not 4+ years later. But what\u2019s done is done. For the record though Jason is his biological father not his \u201creal\u201d father since he hasn\u2019t been the one raising him and being a father to him. Does he plan to pay child support or does he just want the title? I do think it\u2019s important down the line for your son to know his biological father if he wants to and at minimum for medical information. It would be better to start explaining it now in an age appropriate way than suddenly having the big secret revealed years down the road.", "YTA\n\n\"I'm planning on telling Mike somewhere between 13-18.\"\n\nThat sounds like a great a idea, a teenager will love being told that his mom lied to him his whole life and that certainly won't fuck up your relationship with your son!", "ESH\n\nJason is the biological father.

But I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any wiggle room if it was done in absentia. You need to talk to a lawyer and make sure that there\u2019s no way he can fight this later if he establishes a relationship with your son now. Know your legal rights and, if deemed necessary, set some legal parameters before you let Jason keep seeing Mike. \n\nSecond, find a child psychologist now and get an expert opinion on how/when to bring up adoption with your son. There could be a way to start off now in a child friendly way with little detail. For example, you don\u2019t have to say, hey Mike, husband is your dad but Jason is your bio dad. You can start off with one of those kids books that talks about all the different ways families are made up. Tell him that while husband is his dad, another person helped make him so that you and husband could be a family. I don\u2019t know exactly how or what the best way to go about this is, that\u2019s what the shrink is for lol. But you can do this without mentioning Jason at all and then decide at a later date whether to let him know about Jason specifically.  Given other people\u2019s experiences on this thread it sounds like it might be best to broach this sooner rather than later. \n\nBut, like I said, first thing is to protect you and your son. Go see that lawyer and set some strong boundaries with Jason. Make a detailed plan now. Outline everything you think you would and wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with if Jason stays in Mike\u2019s life, and make sure that Jason knows and agrees to it. At this point he has absolutely no rights, but the more you let him form a relationship with Mike, the more complicated things will get later if you don\u2019t have a plan in place now for how you\u2019ll handle all eventualities. To be clear, I\u2019m not saying to keep Mike from Jason. That\u2019s a decision to make with your husband and lawyer. I\u2019m just saying that this difference of opinion between you two will not be the last if you don\u2019t come up with some guidelines now for the future. And Jason needs to know that, as the legal parents, what you and husband say, goes.", "You\u2019re NTA, tell him when he\u2019s a teenager. It\u2019s not fair to your husband.

I do suggest telling your son when when he is about 5 or 6 so he has no real resentment or trauma over it though. Only other thing I could suggest: If the bio dad claims he is telling the truth and never knew anything, he should pursue legal action against Amanda for intercepting his texts/mail. If he he has screenshots/etc. like he said he does, he may have all sorts of legal recourse for what happened here if true. \n\nBut like you said, this is all bs and sounds so convenient, I doubt that to be true.

When I first found out that I was pregnant it was around finals, Jason and I were in grad school, and Jason was so stressed out his exams, work, and family issues that I decided to tell him after his last exam. Also, because I had a bad habit of procrastinating when I get anxious and a part of me was in denial about being pregnant. \n\nI admit that during this time I was acting out of the ordinary and being a little secretive. Unfortunately Jason got the wrong idea and (insert a series of curse words) friend \"Amanda\" (30f) convinced him I was cheating so when I came back to our apartment he was gone. He posted an awful message about me on social media and then blocked me, so did most of our mutual friends along with all of his family members. I was devastated and desperate, so desperate that I even swallowed my pride and reached out to Amanda to beg him to talk to me. \n\nShe then proceeded to taunt me and then sent me a screenshot of Jason's text calling me a liar and pathetic for trying to pass off another man's baby as his. I tried reaching out to Jason once during the later half of my pregnancy and another time after Mike was born before giving up. I tried to go the court's way but Jason got a job overseas so it was what it was. \n\nLater I met \"Dan\" (36m) he was great, we fell in love, got married and was willing to adopt Mike. Shortly after I had my second child Jason reached out to me. The very first thing he did was offer a sincere and meaningful apology to me said that he now realized that Amanda lied to him and that the evidence she had against me was false. Jason also said that Amanda was the one who interceded my attempts to reach out to him and knew that I had had his son. \n\nI did not hold back my anger and he took it. He gave me a few days to cool down before reaching out to me and asking to meet Mike. After discussing it with Dan, we agreed and Jason was introduced to Mike as \"mommy's friend from college\" since then he's met Mike in person about four times, I've sent him a few pictures, and even let him video chat a few times. Recently Jason reached out to me about wanting to know when we'd tell Mike that he was his \"real\" father and I countered back that Dan was his real dad as he was the one who was helping me raise him, and that he could either be \"Uncle Jason\" or nothing at all. \n\nJason got upset and pointed out how it wasn't his fault that he wasn't apart of Mike's life, that he's trying now, and how his family wants to meet him. I countered that if he hadn't of ghosted me he wouldn't be in this situation right now and in the eyes of the law he doesn't get say. Dan agrees that Mike may be too young right now but feels it's wrong to keep Jason out all together, so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We've heavily explained that a Daddy is the person who does the work, gets all the good and the bad, puts them first, and loves their child no matter what. Anyone with the right ingredients can help make a baby, but the one who puts in the work is the parent. It kind of became a fairytale about Mommy kissing frogs and then one day finding Daddy when she was 1.\n\nI got the idea from my cousin who had a similar situation, and she did kind of the same thing.

Going into puberty...a time full of hormones, rebellion and anger...and just finding out my own mother and father and entire extended family all lied to me about something so crucial as WHO I WAS! I loathed both of them for years. This damaged our relationship for a long long time. Only in my 30s did I come to forgive them and trust them again and they were very loving parents. This is not going to play out how you think it will and I urge you to reconsider. Tell him now. Do not lie to him about who he is and who the people in his life are.

When I was younger, like between the ages of 8/9, my dad had a girlfriend with a son who was a toddler. I used to play with him all the time when he would take us over to his girlfriend's house. I found out in my early twenties that the toddler was actually my half-brother. Dad cheated on my stepmom with her best friend. I have a half-sister (from the stepmom) who is 2 months older than the toddler I didn't know was my brother. \n\nNow knowing my dad like I do, I wasn't terribly shocked to learn that the kid I used to play with was my brother. However, it really made me think about whether this big secret was to protect me and my siblings or if it was adults trying to avoid explaining their messy behavior. To this day, my dad refuses to acknowledge that my brother is his son, despite the fact that my brother is a spitting image of our dad. There's definitely resentment there, and it's well-deserved. \n\nI'm hoping you can avoid all that hot mess for Mike's sake. Your family may not end up looking the way you thought it would but maybe it'll turn out better than you think. I'm sure this is difficult for Dan as well. Best of luck to you.", ">o a family counselor who can maybe help guide you through this process so it's less confusing for Mike, since he's so young. He's going to find out the truth at some point.

Jason and were friends and we made you. He moved away, and I met your dad, and we became a family. Just please remember that telling him Jason is (may be) a shitty human being will hurt Mike more than it will hurt Jason. \n\nDefinitely talk to a child therapist to help. I\u2019m a single mom by choice via anonymous donor and there\u2019s a lot of good info about how to explain parentage things to young kids.", "Well clearly he was the one screwing around with Amanda the whole time and that just made it easier to project and blame you. No way did Amanda have that kind of power AND able to intercept all of his mail, email and postal for all of those years if they weren't together. Amanda has more than a few screws loose but I don't blame you for not buying his victim story. He ghosted, he bailed. He could've had a dna test done 4 years ago if he had doubts.

He was inconsistent and immature, he also just stopped calling and ghosted us. From that point on, I knew I couldn't say I didn't at least try, I did. Your son has two parents who clearly love him and want the world for him, whether this Jason guy bails or not doesn't matter, you have the chance to give your son more.

Does he know that Dan adopted him? have you told him part of this? has this never been discussed at all??\n\nI do think your original plan was late. well intentioned maybe, but late\n\na lot of time when children are adopted the advice is to never hide it from them and be open from the beginning and answer more and more questions as they get older and ask more complicated things\n\nI would highly suggest getting that therapist you were talking about now. and asking them how to navigate this situation. they can give you far better advice on when to tell your son and how to tell him and how much to tell him at once. and your son also needs time to get used to a therapist and that environment and trust them\n\nI do think the one difficult aspect here is that you don't have a \"clean\" story to tell him. this would be much easier if this was a situation of surrogacy, or birth adoption, or if his birth father was a one night stand or something   \n\nkids ask questions like who their birth parents are and why their birth parents gave them up or aren't involved with them. they ask for pictures, they ask to know what the person is like  \n\nyou are in a particularly tricky situation where this wasn't an adoption where you didn't know the birth parents. this wasn't a one-night stand. this is someone that you had a long-term relationship with and lived with. and in this situation there isn't even a clean story of you told him and he wanted nothing to do with it, or whatever\n\nhe walked out on you before he knew, and left you with no way to contact him, his family, or mutual friends. and he either did know when you messaged Amanda and those texts were real and he did refuse to have anything to do with your son.... or he didn't know and the story involves a third party lying to you and intercepting his mail  \n\nyou want to be able to tell your child the truth and do it without bashing the biological father and to do it in a way that makes it clear that the kid is 100% not to blame\n\nthis is a difficult one. it's is a lot for a small child to absorb and you don't even know what the actual truth is. you have your guesses but he's got a different story  \n\nand because Jason is in his life now and does now know Mike is his biologically, that makes it even more complicated. can he be honest enough with Mike to say \"I made some very foolish mistakes and trusted the wrong people and wasn't willing to listen to your mom and I'm sorry.\"? or is he going to refuse to take reasonability or blame you??? \n\n100% get that therapist fucking now. have your son start seeing that therapist now and get the therapists advice on how to proceed. and Jason may listen better if he gets told \"Mike's therapist says X\"", "You asked how she intercepted the letter. Not about the efficacy of the service.", "I second this. My best friend's oldest is not her husband's biological son. The in-laws let that slip when he was 14, and it was devastating for him. I don't think your 4 year old needs the whole tawdry tale, but you can't wait for the teen years to provide information with that kind of impact and expect it to not be a betrayal.", "Way too old. That's life shattering at that age.", "You have no clue what you're talking about.  The court can't unadopt a legally adopted child.", "It looks like OP posted an update that all rights were already terminated because the court could not reach Jason.

At a certain point I just turned it over to the courts.", "I'm not sure about all the legal terms but basically when Dan and I started the adoption process we had our lawyers send out a notice to Jason's last known legal address (which Amanda intercepted) and then after no response we petitioned the court and cited abandonment so that Jason's rights would be terminated since Dan was present and willing to take Mike on.", "You can't alienate a parent who has no parental rights.", "I would guess that Jason isn't on the birth certificate, which means that he didn't have to sign away his rights.

The problem is that OP wants to wait until SHE'S ready, not her son.  Ask any child psychologist and they would say that the earlier you introduce this info to the child, the better.  Waiting until he's a teenager is a terrible choice.  And that's what makes OP an AH.", "And? That really doesn\u2019t mean much at all.", "I've never had lawyer can have you served when you live in another country money. Jason took a job in another country for a few years.

I mean, was he in a relationship with this woman at the same time as OP? It seems pretty weird to me that someone would let a friend have access to their accounts and screen their messages for them.", "Yes he is absolutely lying, and if he is going to lie like this, know that he will continue to lie whenever he needs to get his way. That sort of behavior will hurt your son in the long run. He\u2019s not just a guy with a history of ghosting. He\u2019s a guy with a history of ghosting, cruelty, lying, and manipulation. He may be nice to your son now, but eventually he will use his ability to manipulate and tell your son that you withheld that you were pregnant or that you told him it wasn\u2019t his. He WILL put the blame on you like he has done with Amanda. I would steer clear of Jason and one day if your son wants to meet his bio dad, you can warn him of all the lies and lack of accountability so he knows what to expect from this man.", "Your gonna not let his father see his kid because you feel?

I still have identity issues and I'm almost 40.", "One thing to do is to find a child psychologist who specializes in adoptions, they can help you with the most age appropriate way to explain it and how to share more information along through his childhood in age appropriate ways.", "Please research best practices for telling children they're adopted. Nearly all the current research says that children who \"always\" knew they were adopted (ie from their earliest memories) carry far far less trauma about being adopted than those that find out later. \n\nThe research also says that it doesn't matter how good the adoptive parent (s) is, most adoptees carry some level of trauma about the knowledge. There's a feeling of abandonment no matter how much your bio parents might have wanted you. Reducing that trauma is on you, as you're the one holding a key piece of self-identity from Mike.\n\nBut, please, don't take my word for it. Do the research. Talk to adoptees. Make a choice from there.", "Op I told my son at 4. He told me I was mean then he got quiet. I know he remembers because when he was about 8 he started asking questions about his dad. Tell him now. It will be less painful and it will just be a normal part of his life that he will grow up with.", "I agree with the other comments. Tell him the truth now.\n\nI grew up in a non-traditional family. And to my friends, my family was weird. But to me at least, my family felt perfectly normal and it was my friend's traditional families that were weird. But this was because I was always told the truth for as young as I can remember.\n\nTell your kid the truth in broad strokes. You can always fill in the details as he gets older and asks more questions. But basically, telling him the truth now will normalize the situation for him.\n\nIf you have qualms about telling him, it's your own hangups, it's not your kids.", "I just posted about this. I always knew... it was just a part of my life, but I had a friend with the opposite situation.", "The older your kid gets, the more they are going to feel betrayed by you for lying and the more they are going to not trust you. Not just beacuse you kept this big secret for more years, but beacuse older children (or teenagers) are more emotionally complex and separate from their parents. 4 year olds pretty much love and trust their primary caretakers, they forgive easier, and they don't overthink things as much. \n\nThe older your kid gets, the worse telling him is going to know. And you can't keep the truth from him forever, many people know.\n\nYou see posts on here all the time about people who learned they were adopted and their parents hid it from them then it blew up and damaged the relationship. That is the future you are setting up. One where you push Mike into Jason's arms. Jason, the only one who wanted to tell your son the truth, but evil mom and step-dad insisted on lying or they'd keep poor Jason away from Mike. That's how it's going to come off. You really want that? \n\nI understand you are scared but 1) plenty of kids that age know or learn they are adopted and it's fine, and 2) you are making things SO MUCH worse for everyone.", "I found out I was adopted in my teen years. I NEVER got over the feeling of betrayal and never regained the trust in my parents.\n\nTell Mike when he is young. Then it will be all he ever knew.", "Does Mike know that Dan adopted him? I think that\u2019s the most important part tbh. That he knows that Dan didn\u2019t biologically father him, but instead chose him. \n\nI think that thinking someone was your biological parent and then learning they aren\u2019t would be the most traumatic part.", "Conversely to some of these comments, my dad was adopted with 0 adoption trauma or resentment towards any of his parents and he swears it\u2019s because he was always told the circumstances of his birth, it was never something they hid from him. He doesn\u2019t even remember \u201cfinding out\u201d because they told him so early. Tell your son.", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to answer that. If I say age X you will say ok I can leave it until X-1. Right now your son is an age where he will not remember that you told him a lie about such a key thing for the rest of his life. This is your only chance to do the right thing.", "I have no true memories of when I was told. \n\nMy sisters (who were much older) said they think I was 9-10 range. One of my sisters told Mom they had to tell me because the older I got, the harder it would be. Apparently, according to the sisters, I screamed at my parents, refused to call them Mom and Dad, didn't believe anyone, etc. \n\nAdmittedly, I know there are other reasons why I have no memories of my childhood, but it's interesting that my memory - now, even to this day - says I always knew, that no one ever told me because I always knew. Yet, that is not remotely factually true.", "I found out when I was eight and it was devastating. Children are too egocentric to understand that it's not anything that they did wrong.

However, OP wanting to wait until her son is a teenager is a terrible choice and makes her a bad parent.", "Except when it happens. The Court CAN and HAS.", "It really goes by state.  In Texas (for example), if a birth parent can provide compelling evidence that they should be allowed custody, even if their rights were terminated and the child has been adopted, the court can hear the case.  I'm not saying that this situation applies, but each state has different laws regarding this.", "When did the adoption process and sending out the notice start?  Because everyone is bringing up the possibility that the adoption could be voided if Jason can argue he wasn't actually served and were to someone prove that Amanda interfered.  \n\nBut, unless you and Dan fell in love, got married, and decided to adopt super quickly and Mike was a newborn or young baby when this all went down, it's going to be hard to prove to a court that Amanda had this uncanny ability to be there to intercept all court mailings and text messages at every step of the way during a process that generally takes years, and that Jason genuinely had NO idea that any of this was going on.  \nWas Amanda dating/living with Jason for a number of years after he left you?", "So if Jason can prove that Amanda intercepted them, wouldn't it all be void?  Because, through no fault of his own he was never notified?", "You should still start introducing the truth to your son.  He's young enough for it to go better than you think if you do it right.", "I was 4 when my stepdad came into my life, but it was different because I had no dad at all before then, but I feel like I remember understanding somewhat.", "I get that. I see now that the courts were involved and nobody could contact them. I am also confused about Amanda and wondering? Seems like a shitty excuse from Jason.", "Where are you getting the idea that OP plans to lie for his entire life though?", "I agree. My cousins were adopted and found out in their teen years. I didnt go well.  \n\nIf you are open with Mike at his level of understanding, it should go much smoother\n\n I think of it like how I learned about sex/anatomy. As a little kid if I had questions I got answers. The answers matched my level of understanding of my questions and by the time it was time to \"know\", I just already knew. No big birds and bees talk. it just all came out organically.", "I think it\u2019s important to tell him he\u2019s adopted.\n\nBut does that mean she has to tell him about his sperm donor?\n\nCan\u2019t she just leave it at, \u201cYour Dad loved you so much that we went to court and they said he\u2019s your Dad now\u201d.

Your son and husband have a beautiful story, and your son is old enough to understand it.", "But if you had found out earlier, there's a chance you wouldn't have been as traumatized.  8 is even too late to tell a child.  All studies indicate never keeping it from a child.\n\nEdit:  I'm not trying to assume anything about your upbringing of course.  I'm just talking about what psychologists generally say about these things.", "A teenager!!! I missed that part. Yeah that too old!!", "When?  Name one case where this has happened.", "I don't know how he can do that but I feel like that would be an uphill battle unless Amanda is willing to confess and I don't see her as the type to risk going to jail to correct her mistakes since (in America) tampering with someone else's mail is a crime, especially when it's official court documents.", "Nope.  The statute of limitations to contest the adoption has passed.  He can't be unadorned at this point and the USA will only recognize 2 legal parents.", "I'm less worried about telling Mike who his biodad is now and more worried about Jason ghosting him like he did me while Mike is still a child. I don't trust Jason with my son.", "The younger a kid is, the easier it is for them to adapt to these things I think.  I hope you and a good relationship with your stepdad!", "I mean that if he doesn't find out until he is a teenager, he will feel like his mom has lied to him for his entire life.  Which, up to that point, she would have.", "I think if the guy is going to be in his life, you let Mike know who he is. Don't think you can have Uncle Jason in his life for 10 years and all of a sudden it is \"surprise! he was actually your biological father!\". That is just more betrayal. And I think what most people (who have never been through this) don't realize is that you now question, \"well if you lied to me about THAT, what the hell else are you lying about?\" Trust gone.\n\nEither keep Jason out of his life completely (which honestly is super unfair to the child, because adopted children will usually want to know about that missing part of their origins) or be honest about it from the start.", "As an adopted child, I wholeheartedly agree with this. I remember the first time my parents explained adoption to me. Told me my bio mom was not able to take care of me like a mommy should and that they wanted a little girl that they could be mommy & daddy to. I was probably 5 or 6 when we had this conversation. It was never a secret & I have a very healthy attitude about the whole thing. I don't wonder about the bio parents. In fact, if I ever was to meet them, I would thank them for what they did. They gave me a very nice life. Anyway, my point is that it would be better for Mike to know now about being adopted. The discussion about who the sperm donor is should absolutely come later. But don't wait to spring it on him when he is a teenager. That will not go over well.", "Maybe so.  But you are still doing your son a great disservice.  He deserves to know where he came from.  And he will find out eventually, one way or another.  And if it doesn't come from you, your relationship with him will be destroyed.  He will never trust you again, and will resent you for the rest of his life.", "And that is a very real possiblity.  But which is worse, having to help your son deal with his emotions if his bio dad walks out, or him having to go into a psych hospital as a teenager when he has a breakdown after finding out he was lied to for his entire life.", "I agree, I don\u2019t think OP should wait that long."]}
