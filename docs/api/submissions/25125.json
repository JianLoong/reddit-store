I spent the summer living with my parents in my childhood bedroom, but will be moving to graduate housing soon as the program is several states over.\n\nI have an older sister (F34) who is already married to her husband. The two of them got engaged right before the pandemic hit, and were given a choice by my parents, who were paying for the wedding: they could have a small backyard wedding on their original intended date, or they could wait until the pandemic got under control and have the bigger wedding they originally wanted. They chose to not wait and had a small wedding, which I took time off from my bachelor\u2019s program to attend. This was in 2020.\n\nThree years have passed, and my sister has started lamenting that she never got the big wedding she actually wanted. She and her husband have decided to hold what they are calling a vow renewal party, but what is essentially a second wedding, complete with ceremony, bridesmaids, and a wedding dress. The issue is that they\u2019ve set the date for that party in October of 2024. I know for a fact that I will be in a critical period of my graduate program at that time (my degree is in Wildlife Sciences, so certain research can only take place during certain parts of the year and cannot be delayed) so I told my family that I will not be attending. \n\nBoth my sister and my mother are furious as they were expecting me to revise my role as a bridesmaid. They insist that I am being unreasonable and that my sister\u2019s wedding is important. I responded that my sister\u2019s wedding WAS important - the one in 2020, where she was actually married. I made it clear that I am not willing to take any more time away from my education for another party, and that it is a little silly that my parents are paying for a vow renewal after so little time has passed. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: Because a few people have asked, I am attending graduate school under an assistantship program. What that means is that I have agreed to work under a professor on a specific research project, and in return my tuition is waived. We are studying black bears in the field as they prepare to go into hibernation, which makes the month of October an essential time to be at my post.

The idea that attending a single wedding would screw up your studies is just so completely insane.

They became unreasonable and angry with her decision because they felt entitled to her reprising her role in the first wedding, so she stated OBJECTIVE FACTS that she already attended her wedding. The unhinged entitlement of the sister and mother are staggering, but OP didn't insult them at all. That's grasping at straws.", "The sister was given a choice and chose that originally.

Stand your ground OP! She can photoshop you into the pictures if she really wants those before-after pics, and you can hang up your degree next to them.", "NTA. She gave you the choice by not asking you before fixing plans. She can be upset that it's not the choice she would've liked, but it's your choice to make. And it's the right choice.

We are studying black bear hibernation and will be following 10 specific male and female bears as they prepare to go underground, which means almost 24/7 observation of their behavior during fall. Missing any of it would mean a) missing important information and b) leaving unfinished work and jeopardizing my tuition waver. Wildlife sciences, specifically field research, are extremely time-dependent. \n\nI have no issue with you ruling me the AH. But spreading false information is only going to confuse people.", "It\u2019s hilarious that you have no idea that animals have annual behavior patterns that can be pretty easy to time out (i.e. bear hibernation in the fall).", "The choice was between OP's sister and parents. Why does OP get any say if you parent's changed their mind and are now cool paying for two parties? Why would that upset OP?", "And in 4 years!", "You sound like a great friend and family member!", "OP isn't being asked to pay for anything.  Why should OP care if their parents are paying for a 2nd party? Besides jealousy?", "Because they are mad at her for not rearranging her life to attend. So she gets to say it's silly in her mind to rearrange her life for that.
