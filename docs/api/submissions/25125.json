The two of them got engaged right before the pandemic hit, and were given a choice by my parents, who were paying for the wedding: they could have a small backyard wedding on their original intended date, or they could wait until the pandemic got under control and have the bigger wedding they originally wanted. They chose to not wait and had a small wedding, which I took time off from my bachelor\u2019s program to attend. This was in 2020.\n\nThree years have passed, and my sister has started lamenting that she never got the big wedding she actually wanted. She and her husband have decided to hold what they are calling a vow renewal party, but what is essentially a second wedding, complete with ceremony, bridesmaids, and a wedding dress. The issue is that they\u2019ve set the date for that party in October of 2024. I know for a fact that I will be in a critical period of my graduate program at that time (my degree is in Wildlife Sciences, so certain research can only take place during certain parts of the year and cannot be delayed) so I told my family that I will not be attending. \n\nBoth my sister and my mother are furious as they were expecting me to revise my role as a bridesmaid. They insist that I am being unreasonable and that my sister\u2019s wedding is important. I responded that my sister\u2019s wedding WAS important - the one in 2020, where she was actually married. I made it clear that I am not willing to take any more time away from my education for another party, and that it is a little silly that my parents are paying for a vow renewal after so little time has passed. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: Because a few people have asked, I am attending graduate school under an assistantship program. What that means is that I have agreed to work under a professor on a specific research project, and in return my tuition is waived. We are studying black bears in the field as they prepare to go into hibernation, which makes the month of October an essential time to be at my post.

There HAVE been a lot of COVID renewal/redo weddings since around the middle of 2021.

You aren't available.  \n\nNormal people would respect this, and be gracious in accepting your 'regrets.'  \n\nThat they are 'furious' at you, **that's them putting their wants ahead of your needs**, and expecting their anger to force your compliance**.**  You have a job commitment, that's you having a **need**, to keep your commitment to your job and your team.  They are doing a second wedding party, for a wedding you already attended fairly recently.  You have no obligations to attend a second party, simply because they **want** the fancy stuff now.\n\nIf they won't respect your decision to keep your commitment to your work, you might need to start to hang up on calls and stop replying to messages.

One guest was an old friend, who happened to be a minister, and she offered to do a \"vow renewal\".  We thought about it, but decided \"no\".  Why?  Because our vows hadn't lapsed, and no renewal was necessary.  18 years later, they still haven't.\n\nOP, your life has moved on, and theirs should, too.

Being a research scientist requires some sacrifice.  Family needs to understand that.", "Black bears! So cool!\n\nAnyway... the one thing I find fault with is that you didn't need to say anything about the vow renewal being silly. There's no need to be abrasive. All you needed to do was say \"Yes, their ceremony is important, but my education is important, and due to the timing and my commitment, I can't attend. I'm very sorry.\"\n\nIn other words, you're NTA for declining the invitation, but it never hurts to be nice!", "It\u2019s not a wedding it\u2019s an ego trip", "This is not that different from someone who has already committed to being in Antarctica and therefore won't be able to come back for a wedding.\n\nThere are prior commitments that trump most things, and this is one of them. It would be just as reasonable if this was their first wedding. OP has a prior commitment, that commitment cannot be moved.\n\nReasonable people solicit those who are considered essential to ensure there are no conflicts. They did not do that because they are not reasonable.", "Ehhhh. Of course op is NTA for being unable to attend, but I do think that referring to her sister\u2019s wedding as an unimportant, silly party, it was uncalled for and an ah move.", "Don't forget they would also have to pay for 2 weddings for OP too. Considering they gave the sister and either or option but with some fancy rewording sister is getting both.\n\nVowel renewals can be important events but not so much when it's just used as an excuse so you can have a bigger wedding than the one you had 3 yrs earlier.", "I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you why they\u2019re giving her both. I wish I knew the answer!", "Nope, it was just the date that the venue my sister wanted was available", "And if sister cares THAT much about making sure OP was there (first or second time), she would have consulted OP while scheduling to ensure the date didn't conflict with anything non-negotiable. That's what you do for people you really want to attend.", "Except it's not a wedding. It's a vow renewal. Remember OP stated that parents gave sister a choice of paying for a small wedding in pandemic, or wait until after for a big one. But now sister is getting a paid vow renewal on top of the paid wedding. Sister is essentially treating weddings like parties, while calling OP an ah for prioritising time critical education.", "And that people entering grad school for research-based fields absolutely go in at least having an idea of what that research will entail.

It\u2019s not her sisters wedding. That happened 3 years ago which OP took the time off to attend. \n2.

Don't let the ferocious roaring at home get to you. Study the bejasus out of them bears. Congratulations on your achievement and have a wonderful future.", "Nta.  You've worked hard to get that position dont throw it away now.   Make it clear that you're not tossing out your education just so they don't have to change the date.  If they want you their they can change the date.", "NTA\nThey can plan around your education if they want you there.", "NTA.\n\nYour education comes first, no question.  They need to accept that.  If it's so important to them, they can move their date around, it's not an actual wedding anyway.", "NTA this is ridiculous and recently got into a similar spat with another couple. My husband officiated an outdoor covid wedding in 2021 and in 2022 the couple wanted to have a big blowout wedding with all their friends in the city. Initially we were supposed to travel to the first wedding with another couple that we split an Airbnb with (it was in the next state over in a park) \n\nThe couple backed out days before the wedding but we went and stayed in the Airbnb ourselves. Come next year at the \u201cvow renewal\u201d which felt awfully like a 2nd wedding, I had concert tickets for a show that night. We went, my SO officiated again, and then we started saying our goodbyes. Cue this same couple that made it to the second wedding, who starts loudly chastising us for wanting to leave early. \u201cI would NEVER leave before the dancing! Scoff scoff.\u201d I was polite and said I had another obligation but boy have I thought of a million things to say now \u2026 stick to your guns and congrats on getting to the next level with education.", "While this maybe important to her... it's just an important party. This is your future. If they can't get their heads around that well... Good luck OP  \nAlso why 3 yrs not 5 or 10 for the renewal like most people?", "NTA at all!!  Your work for school is very important.  This will be your job once you graduate but you need to complete the master's program.  It sucks your sister didn't have her big wedding, but she chose to have small one, but you are right, that is the one that counts.  Both your mom and your sister need to back off, unless they are willing to pay for your master's program so you can graduate of course.", "NTA, stick to your schooling\n\n\nYou could always tell your mom that if she really wants you there.....you expect to have 2 wedding fully paid or the cash equivalent as well and have that notarized ;)", "Nta", "NTA. She can schedule her vow renewal waste of money at a time that works for you or do it without out you. Or she can have the renewal in the woods next to the bears\u2026 and hopefully be eaten.", "NTA not even if it was her first wedding. No one should be asked to give up their future because of someone\u2019s shitty planning. She knew how important this was for you, so she could have planned around it if she wanted you there. It\u2019s not like she had to have a renewal at that exact time.", "Nope. You attended her wedding. You will be busy and super stressed when they have their \"vanity party\"\n\nMy grandfather died when I was in finals week of lawschool. I was not able to attend the funeral several states away.

If your sister really wanted you there, she would do that.", "Nta. Your assistanceship sounds cool!", "NTA, not unreasonable.

You are in college, and her lack of foresight in scheduling her vow renewal is not your problem.", "NTA\nI never would have chosen a date my brother couldn\u2019t go because he was a \u201cmust have\u201d", "NTA Her vow renewal is not more important than your education and your commitment to your assistantship.", "NTA they're being incredibly selfish.

And why not? It harmed no one. Everyone had a  wonderful evening. People who get on high horses and snark that \"you can't do this, you can't do that\" when it comes to certain things like wedding do-overs are cold and unimaginative, as far as I'm concerned.
