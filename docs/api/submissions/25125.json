The two of them got engaged right before the pandemic hit, and were given a choice by my parents, who were paying for the wedding: they could have a small backyard wedding on their original intended date, or they could wait until the pandemic got under control and have the bigger wedding they originally wanted. They chose to not wait and had a small wedding, which I took time off from my bachelor\u2019s program to attend. This was in 2020.\n\nThree years have passed, and my sister has started lamenting that she never got the big wedding she actually wanted.

What that means is that I have agreed to work under a professor on a specific research project, and in return my tuition is waived. We are studying black bears in the field as they prepare to go into hibernation, which makes the month of October an essential time to be at my post.

A lot of people who scaled back their dream weddings during 2020 and 2021 are renewing their vows/redoing their weddings they way they originally planned them.

If it were a 1-2 day thing by home, then fine. But that's way too much.", "If the parents are willing to fund the renewal/redo/party, then who are you to throw stones? There HAVE been a lot of COVID renewal/redo weddings since around the middle of 2021. All it says about a couple is that they had an idea of what they wanted for their wedding, had to scale back due to circumstances beyond their control, and are taking the opportunity for a do-over (yes, you CAN have do-overs for some things in life, including extravagant weddings). As long as they're not asking guests to give them two sets of gifts (or siblings to take time off of important study programs twice) then no one is harmed.", "Plane tickets are beyond my budget as a graduate student unfortunately, and no one in my family is willing to foot the bill. That would be on top of the price of a bridesmaid dress, gift, etc. \n\nAnd again, even two days would be a lot of time away from my research during such a critical error", "Then their parents are goofy for doing that in my opinion. It\u2019s been years, you don\u2019t need a redo. Move on with your life and accept what it was under the circumstances. This is such entitled behaviour.", "She's being asked to get there herself which apparently isn't a quick trip. She's not being provided a plane ticket and can't afford it herself, but is also the bad guy for not showing up", "If they're willing to pay for a flight/travel, that changes things. If not, more soft NTA.\n\nI can't see how missing one day of studies on a Friday, to come back on the weekend will take a \"lot of time\" from your research when its for your sister's wedding.", "YOU can't recapture the magic, maybe. Other people can. I went to a renewal/redo ceremony in July and everyone knew the couple had married quietly in a small ceremony in July 2020. This summer's party was beautiful and joyful and, yes, magical.\n\nI'm sorry that you evidently lack imagination. And heart.", "Nah, it probably wasn\u2019t as special as the first one.
