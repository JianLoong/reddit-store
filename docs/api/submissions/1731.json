We were going to the golf course and then to have dinner. I don't really play golf but I enjoy riding in the cart, flirting with him, and occasionally chipping/putting. \n\nSo Saturday morning we made some drinks and headed to golf course. When we get there my boyfriend sees a friend of his, Chad, playing with some other people, so he waves at him and we say hey. \n\nAfter this we get a light snack then start playing golf. The round is going okay but my boyfriend is getting annoyed that he isnt playing so well. I'm still enjoying the sun and having fun putting and chipping. \n\nAbout half way through the round of golf, Chad pulls up in his cart. Him and my boyfriend start chatting and I hear Chad mention joining us and playing the back half again. My boyfriend agrees and gets back into our cart to move on. \n\nI ask my boyfriend if Chad is joining us and he says yes and asks if it's a problem. I explain that I thought we were playing together and would prefer him not, my boyfriend brushes me off and says we are still playing together a friend is just joining us. \n\nThe problem is we haven't had a date in awhile, Chad and bf golfed together 2 days prior, and I don't really enjoy hanging out with Chad as he's kinda condescending and I get a little anxious around people I'm not close to. So instead of putting/chipping anymore, I just stayed in the cart and played on my phone. \n\nWe got into an argument after golf and canceled dinner. Now we are at a standstill where boyfriend says he didn't do anything wrong and instead of having fun with him and his friend I ruined my own day and ignored them for my phone. I'm annoyed he put hanging out with his friend before our date, but now I'm questioning whether I should have just tried to have fun with him and his friend. \n AITA? \n\nTldr: Boyfriend agreed to his friend joining our date, I'm annoyed he didn't consider me first.\n\nETA: People are saying I should clarify. When I said \"I don't really play golf\" I didn't mean I dislike playing golf,  I just don't really know how to play. My boyfriend is teaching me but I'm at a very beginner level and still get nervous when other people are watching/judging. \n\nAlso we are late 20s", "created_utc": 1667842039, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yotx0m/aita_for_being_annoyed_my_boyfriend_invited_his/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He does not seem to care about your feelings.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It was a date, not a hangout with friends. He asked if it was okay, you said no, yet he still let Chad join. You were wanting quality time with your bf from the date, but he didn\u2019t care/see that. I don\u2019t blame you for being on your phone as it no longer became a date when Chad joined.\n\nHe could\u2019ve waited for another time, obviously he\u2019s golfed with Chad recently- and hasn\u2019t been able to go on a date with you for a while. \n\nAlso, just because OP didn\u2019t like golfing *(edit: OP enjoys it, just doesn\u2019t practice it),* she still was having fun with her bf until Chad decided to join them. That\u2019s still a date to do- a lot of dates are going somewhere to have fun, and end it with a dinner/meal. She\u2019s NTA for a part of the date (eventually the whole date) being ruined because her bf let a friend join without OP\u2019s permission.", "Does he know how you feel about the friend?", "NTA. It sounds like you don't love golf, and if your boyfriend doesn't focus on you, it's not much of a date for you at all.", "Sounds like your BF is Sheldon Cooper and clueless. Yeah you should be annoyed or even a little pissed off over it. \n\nNTA", "YTA. It was just 9 holes of golf and it\u2019s not like he sought out his friend to specifically create a buffer between the 2 of you. His friend kind of crashed it. You threw a fit for something that likely represented 15% of your date.", "NTA. Golf is a perfect active date. It's isolated enough that you have the illusion of privacy, you can have good conversations and you get to practice a skill. \n\nChad invited himself on a date. That's tacky. You weren't asked your opinion on him joining. That's rude. Now your boyfriend is blaming you for having an opinion on who you spend your time with and behaving according to your preferences. That's asshole behavior. \n\nYour boyfriend does not get to do whatever he wants with no consequences. Your boyfriend made a choice. He is mad at the consequences of his choice and trying to manipulate you into never making him have consequences again. To me this is controlling behavior. Just my opinion though.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

But I don't really know how to play so boyfriend is teaching me; starting with how to chip/put. I just don't want to practice infront of Chad, he changes the entire group vibe and I get anxious.", "I don't necessarily see sitting in the cart on one's phone as a fit.", "I understand your point, but it was 3 hours of our date. They just golfed together 2 days before we haven't had a date in over 3 weeks. I understand boyfriend didn't seek friend out but he could have easily said not this time we are on a date", "Since when does any point of a regular date include other people joining you if you aren't on a double date?

I enjoy going with my boyfriend as a date when he flirts with me and when its slow he teaches me how to play and gives me tips on how to chip/put. \n\nI also don't see telling a friend, \"hey man we are on a date but let's play together again this week\" as a rude thing", "It\u2019s rude now to tell people they can\u2019t join you and your partner on a date? You can\u2019t be serious. And dates usually take place in public spaces. Does this also apply to restaurants, movie theaters\u2026", "Yeah. He can play golf with Chad anytime. You had planned that time for you.", "NTA. BF was rude and inconsiderate. Chad should have caught a clue and moved off.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThat alone makes you NTA, but your bf is one. Who invites a friend to join a date and then to top it off it\u2019s the friend where there\u2019s a mutual dislike?! Your bf created this mess by prioritizing his friend and golfing with him over you. Now it\u2019s time for him to realize that and plan another date in the not so distant future for just the two of you.", "I get that. It's okay to say golf is nice when it's you and the SO, and not when you have to entertain someone else and play somewhat competitively. It's okay to like things a little bit.", "It may help if you add an edit clarifying the \"don't play\" point. It might cut down on the number of people taking it as \"I hate it\" instead of \"I don't know how but am slowly learning\".\n\nPesonally, I don't think it matters either way. You were happy enough to be there and were enjoying yourself before Chad joined you. You even said you were having fun chipping/putting.\n\nI also don't think it matters how long it had been since BF & Chad played together.\n\nWhat matters is that you were on a date. BF should have waved off Chad almost immediately.\n\nNTA.", "They canceled dinner because of it. That doesn\u2019t happen if there wasn\u2019t some emotions on a sleeve.", "If that\u2019s how you feel then you should be upset that your boyfriend suggested a date where you watch him do something only he enjoys. Maybe he should have taken you to a winery or something.", "Is it really a date when you just tag along to watch him golf bc you don't like golfing? Seems like you would have a better time if you just met him for dinner rather than going to activities you don't enjoy in places where people you don't like frequent.", "Also, since when does a date involve watching someone do something that you don\u2019t do?", "Exactly this- he prioritized his friend over his gf. *On a actual date with his gf let alone.* Sometimes third wheeling is okay, especially if all three+ are friends, but not when one of the couple is uncomfortable with it.", "It seems the emotions are on both sides, rather than one person \"throwing a fit\".", "It started out as a fun date when he was flirting with me, giving me tips on how to put/chip, chugging beers with me when he made a good shot. \n\nIt stopped being a fun date when he agreed to his friend joining and started talking golf with him instead.", ">bc you don't like golfing\n \nWho said I don't like golfing? I do like golfing, I just don't have a set of clubs and I haven't really played. \n\nBoyfriend invited me and is trying to teach me, and I want to learn so why wouldn't I go? \n\n\n>where people you don't like frequent\n\n1 person who I don't get along with and didn't want to tag along on my date.", "OP had agreed to it and was enjoying their time together until Chad showed up.", "Fair enough but it sounds like the GF made her annoyance known first. Maybe his reaction to that was too defensive.", ">I don't really play golf but I enjoy riding in the cart, flirting with him, and occasionally chipping/putting.\n\nYou said that- you don't like golfing, you like watching him and distracting him while he golfs. You've expressed zero interest (until now) in wanting to golf. \n\nYou know he's frequently there golfing with friends, it shouldn't be surprising that you'd bump into them.", "I said I dont really play\n\n>occasionally chipping/putting.\n\nIs interest in golfing\n\n>it shouldn't be surprising that you'd bump into them.\n\nIt wasn't surprising to bump into them or to say hey. We bump into people on dates all the time at restaurants and other places, but they don't normally sit down and pull up a chair to join us on our date.", "Not really playing something and not liking something are definitely not the same.", "NTA. Is your boyfriend dismissive of your feelings on other matters or just dates?", "Nta next time take the cart to the club hose wait there then drive home without a word. When he calls ask if he enjoyed his date and hang up", "Nta. Does chad have an art room that your partner frequents?", "NTA. The problem is he deprioritized you. What\u2019s that saying about why pay for the cow when milk is free? No milk for him and maybe some counseling.", "NTA - First of all it was a date. If he didnt wanna listen why did he even ask if its okay even when he was gonna do what he wants. Anyone would be upset over this. You also mentioned he played golf with the friend 2 days ago so it wasnt a very urgent thing to include him between the date. He couldve done that later as well. And then after all of this blaming you? Nuh uh thats not at all a valid point. He better realise it and be sorry.", "NTA. Ew. I would have been pissed if my fianc\u00e9e did that! He should have respected it was date day and ASKED you first before offering Chad to play the back half again.", "NTA.  It doesn't matter that you were golfing, it was a date.  Chad shouldn't have been invited.  If Chad walked into a restaurant while you were on a date, would your BF invite him to join you?  \n\nYour BF shouldn't invalidate your feelings.   You should talk and hear each other out, but your reaction was not \"wrong\".  Your BF & Chad changed the terms of the deal without asking if you minded.  You minded.  Why are you automatically \"wrong\" for wanting to enjoy the time with your BF?  Adding a 3rd wheel obviously changed the dynamic.", "NTA, have a calm sit down with your boyfriend where you have a conversation about your very reasonable needs and why one on one time is important to you and one on one with Chad isn't the same thing.", "NTA. I would have told them to enjoy their date and left.", "YTA, because you STAYED there. Next time this sh\\*t happens, call yourself a ride share and leave the lovebirds alone. In case you haven't seen it yet, YOU'RE THE THIRD WHEEL. Get out now, you're just dating him.", "Nta", "NTA but the original date didn't sound that good either if you're not into it much. Your bf doesn't seem to take an interest in spending quality time with you, but his bff he does.", "NTA. Inviting a third person on a date is rude and says he doesn't prioritize you. I'd find another boyfriend.", "YTA. You don\u2019t seem to like the game. Yeah it was supposed to be a date but you make it seem like you would rather not be playing. Also it\u2019s not like your boyfriend planned for his friend to be there. They both enjoy gold so you ruined it for yourself.", "I think its hard to answer this without knowing more about the relationship.  How long have you been dating?  Do you live together?  How often do you spend time together that isn't officially considered a date?  If it is a new relationship where the only time you are together is on a date, then this is absolutely not an ok thing to do.\n\nIf you have been together a year or two and spend time together outside of official dates, not a big deal.\n\nIf you rarely get 1:1 time and this is outside the norm, then it would be an issue for other reasons.", "I wondered how long it was going to take to get an art room comment. I thought the same thing.", "I'm just learning to play so yeah I would rather not be playing with his friend judging everything I do.\n\nI also know they both enjoy golf, which is why they play together weekly. I just didn't expect him to be invited to join our date when they just played together two days before.", "We don't live together. We've been dating two years. I work a lot more than him, so we don't spend as much time together. He usually comes to my place for dinner Monday and Wednesday. Then we'll do something Saturday and/or Sunday.\n\nI spent the last two weekends with him and a different friend, which was fun because I agreed to it before hand and I like this friend. But I wanted to have a date that was just us getting to  flirt without having to consider the third person there", "Also, be careful because BF having friends who are rude and condescending shows that he's okay with those qualities. I'm not saying dump him but I am saying who he is when you're not around is who he will eventually become to you. Just think carefully about how he treats you and if that's the life you want.", "There is not much to say when your bf asks a friend to join in when the friend has said that he doesn\u2019t really like you. I think you have a bigger problem than you think, and it goes way beyond a single golf game. NTA", "NTA, but your boyfriend likes/respects Chad more than he likes/respects you."]}
