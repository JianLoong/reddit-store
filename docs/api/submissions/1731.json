My boyfriend agrees and gets back into our cart to move on. \n\nI ask my boyfriend if Chad is joining us and he says yes and asks if it's a problem. I explain that I thought we were playing together and would prefer him not, my boyfriend brushes me off and says we are still playing together a friend is just joining us. \n\nThe problem is we haven't had a date in awhile, Chad and bf golfed together 2 days prior, and I don't really enjoy hanging out with Chad as he's kinda condescending and I get a little anxious around people I'm not close to.

He is mad at the consequences of his choice and trying to manipulate you into never making him have consequences again. To me this is controlling behavior.

If he didnt wanna listen why did he even ask if its okay even when he was gonna do what he wants. Anyone would be upset over this. You also mentioned he played golf with the friend 2 days ago so it wasnt a very urgent thing to include him between the date. He couldve done that later as well.

Chad shouldn't have been invited.  If Chad walked into a restaurant while you were on a date, would your BF invite him to join you?  \n\nYour BF shouldn't invalidate your feelings.   You should talk and hear each other out, but your reaction was not \"wrong\".  Your BF & Chad changed the terms of the deal without asking if you minded.  You minded.  Why are you automatically \"wrong\" for wanting to enjoy the time with your BF?  Adding a 3rd wheel obviously changed the dynamic.", "NTA, have a calm sit down with your boyfriend where you have a conversation about your very reasonable needs and why one on one time is important to you and one on one with Chad isn't the same thing.", "NTA. I would have told them to enjoy their date and left.", "YTA, because you STAYED there. Next time this sh\\*t happens, call yourself a ride share and leave the lovebirds alone.

I'd find another boyfriend.", "YTA. You don\u2019t seem to like the game. Yeah it was supposed to be a date but you make it seem like you would rather not be playing. Also it\u2019s not like your boyfriend planned for his friend to be there. They both enjoy gold so you ruined it for yourself.", "I think its hard to answer this without knowing more about the relationship.  How long have you been dating?  Do you live together?  How often do you spend time together that isn't officially considered a date?  If it is a new relationship where the only time you are together is on a date, then this is absolutely not an ok thing to do.\n\nIf you have been together a year or two and spend time together outside of official dates, not a big deal.\n\nIf you rarely get 1:1 time and this is outside the norm, then it would be an issue for other reasons.", "I wondered how long it was going to take to get an art room comment. I thought the same thing.", "I'm just learning to play so yeah I would rather not be playing with his friend judging everything I do.\n\nI also know they both enjoy golf, which is why they play together weekly. I just didn't expect him to be invited to join our date when they just played together two days before.", "We don't live together. We've been dating two years. I work a lot more than him, so we don't spend as much time together. He usually comes to my place for dinner Monday and Wednesday. Then we'll do something Saturday and/or Sunday.\n\nI spent the last two weekends with him and a different friend, which was fun because I agreed to it before hand and I like this friend. But I wanted to have a date that was just us getting to  flirt without having to consider the third person there", "Also, be careful because BF having friends who are rude and condescending shows that he's okay with those qualities. I'm not saying dump him but I am saying who he is when you're not around is who he will eventually become to you. Just think carefully about how he treats you and if that's the life you want.", "There is not much to say when your bf asks a friend to join in when the friend has said that he doesn\u2019t really like you. I think you have a bigger problem than you think, and it goes way beyond a single golf game. NTA", "NTA, but your boyfriend likes/respects Chad more than he likes/respects you.", "I rule NTA for one specific reason: He asked if you were okay with Chad joining, you said no (good on you for being honest), and then he berated you for your answer.  Ideally, he would have immediately told Chad you were on a date, and that it would have to be another time. Barring that, he should have asked you your opinion before agreeing with Chad. When he failed to do that, he should have respected the answer you gave when he finally he did ask.", "NTA: Date means the two of you not bringing a friend with! So he don't care that you ask to have more alone time with him than maybe you should have your alone time at all!             Stop looking after him, don't beg anymore and if he still not understand the basic of relationship like listen to your feelings well maybe you should question yourself why you are with a guy who prefer spending time with others than you!", "I\u2019m pretty sure your boyfriend really only wants to date Chad\n\nNTA", "NTA It was a date, it was rude and inconsiderate to invite his friend to join you, especially someone you don't like.", "My boyfriend of 3 months as of today will ask me even if it's just his family around or his cousins who iv met 2 of before. I have. Bad anxiety at Times and usually of I'm uncomfortable play with his dog Zoe. If your man won't consider your feelings then either have a conversation about it and make a plan moving forward or RUN LIKE THE WIND. Raise your standards girl. If he won't consider u then next time get revenge have ur friends show up and see how he likes that", "Your boyfriend would rather spend time playing golf than going on a date with you doing something together you both enjoy. Full stop. The friend is a red herring at best; an obvious symptom of dysfunction in how your boyfriend handles time with you at worst. (And as others have said, tolerating condescending behavior in a friend tells you who he really is) Find a new boyfriend. NTA", "NTA. It was supposed to be a date just for the TWO of you, not three. You even told him you thought it would be you and him playing together and you\u2019d prefer chad not to play with the two of you. He dismissed your feelings and then he got mad when you got upset.", "NTA. You should have left and told him to have fun on his date with Chad.", "NTA. Remind him this was a date not a hangout, and next time you should pick an activity that YOU like as much as your bf does golf.", "NTA\n\nMy only question is if you guys both called this a date when it was planned. I know some people dont always assume something is a date. But either way it was shitty of him to use your quality time together to play golf with his friend.", "NTA But I think you may have to reevaluate your bf here\n\nIt sounds like he does not prioritize you and you need to tell him that's why it upset you that he brought his friend along", "NTA, but I am curious: when you were planning this day, were you referring to it as a date? My partner used to do this all the time and his reasoning was that if we weren't calling it \"date night\" or a date, he just thought of it as us hanging out. I think it sounds idiotic, but if his brain works like that I can only assume other people's might too. Just food for thought.", "NTA", "NTA. Your boyfriend is the asshole here. He should have just said no to Chad joining. \"We're on a date. I'll catch you some other time,\" is pretty easy to say. Sulking is a bit immature, but you're not an asshole for that. \n\nIf you have issues with anxiety, is your boyfriend aware? Is he aware that Chad is condescending? Does your boyfriend remember/realize that when you told him you weren't comfortable having Chad join you he totally ignored you and treated you like your opinion and feelings don't matter? Your asshole boyfriend may need you to lay these things out plainly for him. If he still refuses to acknowledge fault and promise to do better going forward, dump him.\n\nYou should be with someone who actually gives a damn about you, your happiness, and your relationship. I'm not sure your boyfriend is good boyfriend material.", "NTA.  Move on to a bf that actually gives a shit and prioritizes you.", "NTA. I\u2019d be pissed if my husband invited someone to our date without even asking me, and he would also be if I did the same. Happy cake day btw, OP!", "ESH.\nExcept Chad, who probably didn't know y'all were on a date since no one piped up to say so when he mentioned joining you.\n\nBF sucks for not saying anything about a date and you also didn't say anything to Chad about the date. You also suck for playing on your phone while they played. \n\n\nMy petty self would be over to Chad the moment he pulled up in his cart and once he said anything about joining and before BF could say anything is when I'd say \"well, we're on a date\" and see what the BF does/says. If BF says it's just the last half. If Chad said anything about the way I played, I'd remind him I'm a beginner and my BF is showing me how to play on OUR date that you're cutting into, so you can zip it. If Chad didn't leave after that and kept playing but stayed silent, then when golfing is done I'd ask BF \"now can we continue our date ALONE for dinner\"? And if BF said anything to me about being rude I'd remind him that he let someone in on OUR date without informing said person about the date and also it was a person who he played golf with just 2 DAYS prior.", "NTA Any reason you didn't ask immediately why he invited his friend on a date? Then follow with you may be attracted to Chad but I'm not so no 3 way chance in hell.\n\nIt would have embarrassed them but clued them in its a date.
