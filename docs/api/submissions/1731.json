We were going to the golf course and then to have dinner. I don't really play golf but I enjoy riding in the cart, flirting with him, and occasionally chipping/putting. \n\nSo Saturday morning we made some drinks and headed to golf course. When we get there my boyfriend sees a friend of his, Chad, playing with some other people, so he waves at him and we say hey. \n\nAfter this we get a light snack then start playing golf. The round is going okay but my boyfriend is getting annoyed that he isnt playing so well. I'm still enjoying the sun and having fun putting and chipping. \n\nAbout half way through the round of golf, Chad pulls up in his cart. Him and my boyfriend start chatting and I hear Chad mention joining us and playing the back half again. My boyfriend agrees and gets back into our cart to move on. \n\nI ask my boyfriend if Chad is joining us and he says yes and asks if it's a problem. I explain that I thought we were playing together and would prefer him not, my boyfriend brushes me off and says we are still playing together a friend is just joining us. \n\nThe problem is we haven't had a date in awhile, Chad and bf golfed together 2 days prior, and I don't really enjoy hanging out with Chad as he's kinda condescending and I get a little anxious around people I'm not close to. So instead of putting/chipping anymore, I just stayed in the cart and played on my phone. \n\nWe got into an argument after golf and canceled dinner. Now we are at a standstill where boyfriend says he didn't do anything wrong and instead of having fun with him and his friend I ruined my own day and ignored them for my phone. I'm annoyed he put hanging out with his friend before our date, but now I'm questioning whether I should have just tried to have fun with him and his friend. \n AITA? \n\nTldr: Boyfriend agreed to his friend joining our date, I'm annoyed he didn't consider me first.\n\nETA: People are saying I should clarify. When I said \"I don't really play golf\" I didn't mean I dislike playing golf,  I just don't really know how to play. My boyfriend is teaching me but I'm at a very beginner level and still get nervous when other people are watching/judging.", "created_utc": 1667842039, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yotx0m/aita_for_being_annoyed_my_boyfriend_invited_his/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He does not seem to care about your feelings.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It was a date, not a hangout with friends. He asked if it was okay, you said no, yet he still let Chad join. You were wanting quality time with your bf from the date, but he didn\u2019t care/see that. I don\u2019t blame you for being on your phone as it no longer became a date when Chad joined.\n\nHe could\u2019ve waited for another time, obviously he\u2019s golfed with Chad recently- and hasn\u2019t been able to go on a date with you for a while. \n\nAlso, just because OP didn\u2019t like golfing *(edit: OP enjoys it, just doesn\u2019t practice it),* she still was having fun with her bf until Chad decided to join them. That\u2019s still a date to do- a lot of dates are going somewhere to have fun, and end it with a dinner/meal. She\u2019s NTA for a part of the date (eventually the whole date) being ruined because her bf let a friend join without OP\u2019s permission.", "Does he know how you feel about the friend?", "NTA. It sounds like you don't love golf, and if your boyfriend doesn't focus on you, it's not much of a date for you at all.", "Sounds like your BF is Sheldon Cooper and clueless. Yeah you should be annoyed or even a little pissed off over it. \n\nNTA", "YTA. It was just 9 holes of golf and it\u2019s not like he sought out his friend to specifically create a buffer between the 2 of you. His friend kind of crashed it. You threw a fit for something that likely represented 15% of your date.", "NTA. Golf is a perfect active date. It's isolated enough that you have the illusion of privacy, you can have good conversations and you get to practice a skill. \n\nChad invited himself on a date. That's tacky. You weren't asked your opinion on him joining. That's rude. Now your boyfriend is blaming you for having an opinion on who you spend your time with and behaving according to your preferences. That's asshole behavior. \n\nYour boyfriend does not get to do whatever he wants with no consequences. Your boyfriend made a choice. He is mad at the consequences of his choice and trying to manipulate you into never making him have consequences again. To me this is controlling behavior. Just my opinion though.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

But I don't really know how to play so boyfriend is teaching me; starting with how to chip/put.

Your bf created this mess by prioritizing his friend and golfing with him over you. Now it\u2019s time for him to realize that and plan another date in the not so distant future for just the two of you.", "I get that. It's okay to say golf is nice when it's you and the SO, and not when you have to entertain someone else and play somewhat competitively. It's okay to like things a little bit.", "It may help if you add an edit clarifying the \"don't play\" point.

You were happy enough to be there and were enjoying yourself before Chad joined you.

Maybe his reaction to that was too defensive.", ">I don't really play golf but I enjoy riding in the cart, flirting with him, and occasionally chipping/putting.\n\nYou said that- you don't like golfing, you like watching him and distracting him while he golfs. You've expressed zero interest (until now) in wanting to golf. \n\nYou know he's frequently there golfing with friends, it shouldn't be surprising that you'd bump into them.", "I said I dont really play\n\n>occasionally chipping/putting.\n\nIs interest in golfing\n\n>it shouldn't be surprising that you'd bump into them.\n\nIt wasn't surprising to bump into them or to say hey. We bump into people on dates all the time at restaurants and other places, but they don't normally sit down and pull up a chair to join us on our date.", "Not really playing something and not liking something are definitely not the same."]}
