{"id": 2330, "submission_id": "yvcnrf", "title": "AITA for telling my wife to calm down and stop engaging in a conversation?", "selftext": "Ask for info as needed. I'm sure I will miss details with the character limit. Wife and I have 3 kids and our last born almost did her in. She and our son were hospitalized for a week and it was incredibly nerve wracking and traumatic. Important info. Also the other part of important info.. my wife does not like dogs (more so she doesn't like \"dog mom's/dad's\" but you get my point). She has more than enough reason not to and I will answer questions on that but if asked in the comments. But either way, just know she has many, many reasons and all of them are valid. \n\nAs you can imagine, we do not have dogs. Never plan to either. My family is huge on animals though, dogs especially. My parents however are very much so respectful of my wife's concerns when it comes to dogs around our kids and they never, ever push the issue. My sister is the complete opposite. She has 2 German Shepherds, a Great Dane and two ankle biters of some sort that are Heeler breed mixes. They go everywhere with her, including to her job. My wife avoids family gatherings that involve my sister and I don't blame her. When we host at our place, the dogs are not invited which means my sister hardly ever comes. This has caused fights in the past because my sister says we are denying \"her children\" happiness and family time. She knows about my wife's severe trauma and thinks she should just get over it, basically. My wife is in therapy, by the way. So please don't pull the \"your wife needs therapy\" lines. \n\nAnywho: we hosted dinner at our place yesterday evening and my sister decided to join for once. At some point it got on the topic of traumatic births. My wife doesn't generally talk about hers but my mom started asking questions (she went through a traumatic birth herself so it was an innocent conversation). My sister continuously interjected with stories about her dog and was minimizing my wife's struggles in a way that I'm sure affected her more than me. Basically saying \"every mom goes through struggles, *EVEN DOG MOMS* and it's not that serious\". At one point I did tell my sister to shut the fuck up but she kept at it. My wife full snaps. Stands up from the table, slams her fists and starts berating my sister saying \"I don't give a flying fuck about your mutts, nor do I care to hear about your imaginary struggles of being a mom when you don't have children and have never almost fucking died and lost your baby at the same god damn time.\" This led to her screaming at my sister to get out of the house and told her she had better never show her face here again. I have never seen my wife like this. It was clearly bottled for a long time. Everyone was silent. I told my wife to calm down and stop engaging with the conversation. I wasn't condescending or being an AH. I was calm and just trying to calm her down. But the second I said that she looked at me and said \"Are you seriously not going to fucking defend me right now?\" And left the house. She is at her mom's with the kids. My mom says I shouldn't have said anything.

It was incredibly insensitive of your sister to compare her fucking dogs to what your wife went through\n\nThis is a rough one but YTA.", "> I told my wife to calm down and stop engaging with the conversation. I wasn't condescending\n\nTelling someone who is reasonably upset after being ignored and dismissed repeatedly by a guest in their own home to calm down is absolutely condescending.  YTA", "YTA. Your wife and child almost died and your sister was trying to make the conversation about her and \"her mutts\". She was being condescending to both the women sharing horror stories in what should have been a safe environment. Your wife snapped because she did have it bottled up. YOU should have been the one to say, \"Sis this conversation is not about you. You need to drop your part or please leave.\" You did not, then you shamed your wife by not saving your well meaning but badly timed remarks to later in the evening. You chose your sister by what you did, good intentions or not. You owe your wife a public apology and a big one. So does your sister, though she also owes one to the other woman in the story too. (Is this woman her mom too?)\n\nEdited to add final question.", "YTA - your wife was in the middle of an episode because your sister wouldn\u2019t shut up, and you wouldn\u2019t physically kick your sister out.  \n\nThe absolute last thing to say to a person in the middle of an emotional outburst is to say calm down.  This is like pouring gasoline on a wildfire.  Your wife was extremely upset about a deeply personal traumatic experience.  She needed you to be on her side immediately remove the trigger from her presence and then comfort her.  She needed you to be her knight in shining armor to save her, and you were like a school teacher, scolding her for talking out of turn.  She needed a hug, not advice.\n\nSo, if you want you wife and kids back, you need to apologize for not being her protector when she needed one.  You should have stopped the conversation sooner and told your sister to shut her trap or you were physically kicking her out of the house.  Your sister had no intention of shutting up, because she wanted her say.\n\nYour lesson for the future is when someone is having an emotional breakdown, which is what you wife was having, she was not in control of her emotions and is not capable of taking instructions.  Your only move is to remove the trigger, provide support and comfort.\n\nShe can\u2019t trust you now.  You didn\u2019t stand up for her when she needed you the most.  So she can\u2019t trust you which is why she took the kids and went to her parents.  And she isn\u2019t going to come back until she can trust you again.", "YTA - Your wife is right. Your sister was being AWFUL and you made a meager attempt to put her in her place and then when sister kept going you tell your wife to calm down?? What the fuck is wrong with you??", "YTA and your wife is my hero. \n\nAt no point in human history has telling someone to \"calm down\" come across as anything other than condescending.", "YTA\n\n>**I told my wife to calm down** and stop engaging with the conversation. **I wasn't condescending** or being an AH\n\n\"Calm down\" is a vey loaded term. Your wife heard your words as a dismissive silencing tactic, rather than the soothing phrase that you intended.\n\nYour mom understands this. Whatever you intended, the fact is that you were trying to defuse the situation by silencing your wife. \n\n>My sister continuously interjected with stories about her dog and was minimizing my wife's struggles\n\nYour wife was not the one who needed to be silenced. You prioritized your sister - and that was completely an AH move.", "Sorry but YTA.\n\nFrom your perspective, you would just like to be able to have a family gathering that didn't devolve into this \"dogs are not children\" argument.  But I will tell you that I don't know a single person who will calm down when you tell them to \"calm down.\"  The very words are insulting because you're basically telling them that they are being irrational.  That they are wrong to be getting upset.\n\nYou don't mention yourself interjecting at all, backing up your wife's points before the final blowup. Nor did you take her side when you finally did speak up.  The most charitable thing I can think is that you were trying to be a good host, but you were certainly being a bad husband.\n\nYour sister is objectively WRONG. I say this as a husband, father, and pet owner.  It is just fine for people to get parental feelings about their pets.  But your sister did not give birth to her dogs, she did not almost die.  So for her to try to make an equivalence is INSULTING to you wife.\n\n**TLDR, your sister insulted your wife. Apologize to your wife for not having her back.**", "YTA.\n\nYOUR sister acted absolutely horrifically, and you should have handled it before the situation reached the point that it did. You tried, failed, so your wife had to, and your response was to tell HER to calm down?!\n\n>I wasn't condescending\n\nSure bro. Keep telling yourself that.", "Yta\n\nWho the hell let's their sister basically compair their children to dogs.\n\nLike I'm a dog mom but come on. She was literally trying to make her dogs more important than your wife almost dying.\n\nGrow up before your wife decides that she needs someone who supports her", "YTA, telling someone having a meltdown to just calm down never works. When it's a justified meltdown, it also gives the impression you just don't care or understand how serious the issue is. You should apologize to your wife and say you were just trying to de-escalate the situation but realize now it was unhelpful. Whatever it takes to make her feel you are on her side.", "YTA for telling her to \u201ccalm down\u201d and essentially to stop talking while she was defending herself - telling someone to manage their emotions immediately while they\u2019re being triggered is minimizing their feelings.\n\nYou should\u2019ve waited until your sister left and then *helped* your wife calm down. \n\nAnd you should\u2019ve been 100% behind her kicking your sister out, and hopefully telling your sister she needs to apologize. Your sister is an inconsiderate asshole.\n\nI don\u2019t have children, and I\u2019ve lost loads of pets traumatically. While my pets are my children, and I\u2019d literally kill someone trying to hurt them without an ounce of remorse, I would *never* compare the experience of human children to pet children. Yeah, don\u2019t minimize my experience as a pet parent who has lost their pets by saying \u201cwell they\u2019re just animals\u201d or \u201cwell it\u2019s not like they\u2019re your kids\u201d, at the end of the day they *are* animals. If I ever had human children, though, as much as I\u2019d do everything for my critters and spoil the shit out of them just the same, my human children would 100% take priority if it ever came to it (and this is from someone who has no plans of ever having children). \n\nFfs.", "YTA the fact that you allowed your sister to disrespect your wife in your home knowing her struggles is wild to me. If anything you should told your sister to stop the conversation or she could leave your home. Apologize to your wife and talk to your sister bout herself", "Light, YTA. You chose the wrong target to de escalate the tension. You should have told your sister to leave. If/when your wife continued to engage you should have told her to take the kids to the backroom or something, get her out of there, and that you'd handle it.  Instead you chose to try to de escalate through your wife, not blaming her but even then it's not surprising she thought you weren't taking her side. I get where you're coming from and why you did it, but that split decision fucked you.\n\nAlso ban your sister if it's not done already.", "YTA \n\nNever in the history of forever has telling a righteously angry person to calm down worked.\n\nYou were just pouring gasoline on the fire dude.", "YTA. Your wife\u2019s struggles were basically diminished by your sister trying to compare her struggles as a dog mom to your wife and child almost dying. You telling your wife to calm down and not saying anything to your sister kind of puts you on her side, and not your wife\u2019s. You should have have told your sister to shut up, or not say anything at all.", "YTA. Telling anyone, but ESPECIALLY a woman, to \"calm down\" is condensending.", "Gentle YTA\n\nEven if your wife had been out of line, she is an autonomous human being, and it's not your place to police her behavior or her emotions, especially in front of other people. It's infantilizing. I know you didn't mean it that way, but that's how it would have felt to her.", "YTA.  You should have personally escorted your sister out the door before it got as far as it did.  But then when you told her to calm down instead of walking your sister out, you sealed your own fate.  You need to grovel for forgiveness and tell your wife that your sister won't ever be invited back.", "I am (or was until she passed) one of \u2018those crazy dog mums\u2019, but wouldn\u2019t have ever dreamt of comparing myself to a human parent, let alone one who experienced a traumatic birth. Everyone there should have told your sister to shut TF up. YTA for allowing it to go on and upset your wife.", "Soft YTA. I don't think you were trying to intentionally be an AH. I think you were trying to defuse a terrible situation. I also don't think your wife was trying to bite your head off, but she was already hot under the collar and took your words wrong. Tell her you're sorry. Tell her you screwed up. Tell her you weren't trying to be an AH, and you realize you said the wrong words.  From the tone of your post it sounds like you do support your wife and so do your parents. Just say sorry, let her cry, patch things up and move forward :)", "hard situation. you\u2019re mom is right about you staying silent, but oopsie daisies. apologize and clarify that your wife is still your priority. you\u2019re sister having ankle-biters at work is bonkers to me", "YTA", "YTA - sorry it was the sons b-day, the dinner was to celebrate him.", "Yta u should\u2019ve defended her", "YTA\n\nCut your sister off and apologize to your wife", "YTA your sister is an AH but jesus h christ your sister just told your wife it's no big deal she and her child almost died  you need to defend your d@mn wife not tell her to calm down.", "YTA.

YTA.", "OP, telling someone that upset is 100% condescending. You owe your wife an apology for that.

The wording you chose gave no acknowledgement to your wife\u2019s feelings, and the rudeness of your sister. Very likely your wife felt like you were severely underreacting  to her trauma and near death experience. \n\nThe focus shouldn\u2019t have been on your wife. It should\u2019ve been on your sister.

The moment you told your wife to calm down, you were being condescending. You may think you would respond differently if you were in your wife's shoes. Having watched the \"calm down, honey\" scenario hundreds of times, I'm pretty certain you would also just get more upset.\n\nYour sister was being a gigantic AH, and so were you for telling *your wife* to calm down and not telling your sister more forcefully to get out.", "YTA \n\nI don't think you necessarily meant to be, though. \"Calm down\" is a loaded phrase, as others have already pointed out. It *never* results in the person actually calming down. \n\nI had a very traumatic, near death medical crisis with my first pregnancy that almost took us both out. If I was in your wife's shoes, I probably would have lost my shit, too. It's a *trauma response* . And I'm saying this as someone who owns and generally loves dogs. It's NOT the same. Not even a little. And your sister was incredibly dismissive of your wife's very real trauma. She knew what she was doing. \n\nApologize. A real, heartfelt apology. Then make damn sure your wife is never exposed to your sister again. \n\nIf your wife hasn't gotten therapy, it may be something y'all should look into. Medical PTSD is a very real thing and that may be a part of what is going on here (and it can happen even if the medical treatment was 100% appropriate, not just when the person receives subpar treatment). But you need to choose your words VERY carefully when you approach this topic. Any hint of blaming her will blow up in your face. There are a lot of really complicated emotions that go with almost dying. Add in almost having the child you are growing die as well, and it's even more complex. Guilt is a big one. It's ok to need help to work through that. \n\nFor future reference, the appropriate thing to do would have been to kick your sister out immediately.

You needed to stand up for your wife, not try and restore peace to the table. It may have seemed like it was more important that everyone get along and have a nice evening, but sometimes someone says something so inexcusably wrong that keeping the peace is impossible.

There's a huge fucking difference and its hard to fully \"get\" until you have your own kid, but I was never shitty enough to compare a pet with a person before because I'm not stupid.", "YTA.\nMy dude. Your wife nearly died giving birth to one of your children and you \"calmly\" listened to your sister minimize her experience? You say you told your sister to stop, but you calmly watched your wife, who is in therapy because of her trauma, break down and \"calmly\" told her to just calm down and not engage after your sister attacked and belittled her in her own home???\n\nYou need to apologize.  Perhaps you need to ask for a few couples sessions for a trained therapist can help you understand more how upsetting and triggering this confrontation was. \n\nYou need to set firm boundaries with YOUR sister and you need to help uphold the boundary your wife is setting which is your sister not being welcome in your home.", "YTA - telling someone to calm down is condescending- especially after you escalated matters by telling sister to \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d", "Yta.... why would you tell your wife to calm down and not tell your sister to shut up and leave?   \n\nAnd saying calm down, doesn't, in fact, calm anyone down..... you know this.  Go apologize to your wife, over and over and over again. And then do whatever she asks and keep showing her you mean your apology.", "I\u2019m gonna say soft YTA here. As you had already told your sister off I feel like the \u201ccalm down\u201d comment is coming more from a place of concern for your wife\u2019s wellbeing - any strong emotions like that can just feel exhausting - and probably thought you were de-escalating the situation. It\u2019s just a poor choice of words to use.\n\nObviously it\u2019s done now, so just apologise to your wife and let her know that you 100% have her back and shouldn\u2019t have told her to calm down. As you say this sounds like it\u2019s clearly been bubbling up for a long time.", "NTA. Your wife fully defended herself and you interjecting would not have really helped. Those were things your wife needed to say and she said them. You only tried to diffuse the situation from getting truly out of hand. Now is where you comfort your wife. Your sister needed that reality check.", "[deleted]", "Agreed. And if someone important in your life is rightfully upset and you wanna deescalate the situation one of thee worst things you can say is \u201ccalm down.\u201d You may as well have said, \u201cstop being on fire\u201d while throwing gasoline onto a burning car.", "Yes. The worlds \"calm down\" has NEVER actually made someone calm down and you are almost as big an asshole as your sister for saying that to your wife. That almost died giving birth.", "Men really need a class before they should be allowed to use the phrase \"calm down\"  with their partners.\n\nYTA", "Yes, we share the same mom. My mom is very much so on my wife's side.", "yup. OP should have nipped his sister\u2019s interruptions in the bud way before his wife got fed up. And then to say \u201ccalm down\u201d? like, dude.\n\nOP, the fact that you *allowed* your sister to keep yammering and invalidate your wife\u2019s experience just told your wife that your sister\u2019s comfort is more important to you than your wife\u2019s.\n\nYTA", "This. OP probably doesn't realize the baggage saying \"calm down\" has. Odds are excellent the wife has been told this multiple times before in her life to pressure her into quietly accepting mistreatment.", "I told her to never speak to us again and that she was not welcome at our house anymore, just as my wife said. I don't know. I didn't know what else to do. I've never seen my wife like that so I was taken by surprise.", "Came here to say same thing. I feel OP meant well but him telling his wife to calm down made it seem like *she* was the problem, and queue her anger at not being defended. \nI think she will be more amenable to talking soon and you may need to grovel a bit as she needs to ensure you are on her side on this. \nGentle YTA - high stress situation, we rarely do the \u201creasonable and right\u201d thing at the time.", "i think you've got the wrong post lol", "He was just trying to de-escalate the situation. What's wrong with that?", "He kind of did, he says he actually told his sister to \"shut the fuck up\".", "No he very much is. He told his sister to shut up once and then let her keep going until his wife snapped. Then instead of focusing on stopping the sister fromcomparing raising her dogs to his wife almost dying told the wife it's not worth it.\n\nAn apology to the wife from the sister will mean absolutely nothing and is worthless because she's already shown she views her dogs as more important subjects than the fact her sil almost died.", "I mean the dude did tell the sister to shut up once and then didn't do anything while the sister kept comparing her dogs to his wife almost dying.\n\nEveryone but the wife and mother are assholes", "Why E S H? His sister was absolutely the biggest flaming asshole but his wife was well within her rights to go nuclear on her for that level of insulting disrespect. She's not an asshole at all here.", "What are you even on right now?\n\nComparing parent/child bonds with pets? 9-11 with a car accident? Prioritizing blowing out candles over his wife's obvious (and justified) upset?\n\nTry again,  this failed in every conceivable way.", "But wouldn\u2019t he lose his husband badge if he didn\u2019t say \u201ccalm down\u201d when he DEFINITELY shouldn\u2019t have said it?", ">my mom is very much on my wife\u2019s side. \n\nAt least someone is. Not you clearly.", "That should be a big sign. Moms naturally tend to want to give the benefit of doubt to their kids so if she says both of hers are 100% in the wrong in this situation it means it was a really big, obvious mess up.", "YTA.  \n\nYeah well.  When someone has SEVERE birth trauma and someone else tries to equate that to having a dog, shit tends to get heated.  \n\nApologize to your wife.  Tell her she was absolutely right and you did not act appropriately in that moment.  Tell your sister to fuck off and be done with her until she can sincerely apologize (and mean it) and stop comparing your wife and child almost dying to owning pets.", "I think you just tossed into the mix too, but the sister is out. \n\nJust make that clear to your wife", "Have you ever seen someone calm down because they were told to?", "You address the instigator (the sister) not the target (the wife).", "I just think in his (potentially spineless) way he thought he was defending her. My husband sometimes expects me to gather five things from saying one thing, which isn\u2019t fair but his intention is in the right place. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not about the apology meaning anything to the wife, it\u2019s about him understanding that the only damage control possible and way forward is to stand in complete unison with wife and demand nothing short of a complete apology from sister. Then, if I were him and wife, I\u2019d go no contact.", "ESH is when more than one person is an asshole", "Nope!  He would have lost his mail chauvinist \ud83d\udc37 badge. He didn't need that anyway.\n\nShould have told his sister to shut up. She was over the top outrageously rude. Poor wife had had enough", "YES.", "Fair enough, just seems wrong to say everyone sucks when half the people involved were perfectly right.", "I agree, I just hope he was expecting the crowd to laugh and then cut to commercials once his wife glared at him. \n\nBecause it\u2019s too clich\u00e9 for him not to realize saying \u201ccalm down\u201d is a death sentence.", "Why are you yelling? Calm down."]}
