{"id": 2330, "submission_id": "yvcnrf", "title": "AITA for telling my wife to calm down and stop engaging in a conversation?", "selftext": "Ask for info as needed. I'm sure I will miss details with the character limit. Wife and I have 3 kids and our last born almost did her in. She and our son were hospitalized for a week and it was incredibly nerve wracking and traumatic. Important info. Also the other part of important info.. my wife does not like dogs (more so she doesn't like \"dog mom's/dad's\" but you get my point). She has more than enough reason not to and I will answer questions on that but if asked in the comments. But either way, just know she has many, many reasons and all of them are valid. \n\nAs you can imagine, we do not have dogs. Never plan to either. My family is huge on animals though, dogs especially. My parents however are very much so respectful of my wife's concerns when it comes to dogs around our kids and they never, ever push the issue. My sister is the complete opposite. She has 2 German Shepherds, a Great Dane and two ankle biters of some sort that are Heeler breed mixes. They go everywhere with her, including to her job. My wife avoids family gatherings that involve my sister and I don't blame her. When we host at our place, the dogs are not invited which means my sister hardly ever comes. This has caused fights in the past because my sister says we are denying \"her children\" happiness and family time. She knows about my wife's severe trauma and thinks she should just get over it, basically. My wife is in therapy, by the way. So please don't pull the \"your wife needs therapy\" lines. \n\nAnywho: we hosted dinner at our place yesterday evening and my sister decided to join for once. At some point it got on the topic of traumatic births. My wife doesn't generally talk about hers but my mom started asking questions (she went through a traumatic birth herself so it was an innocent conversation). My sister continuously interjected with stories about her dog and was minimizing my wife's struggles in a way that I'm sure affected her more than me. Basically saying \"every mom goes through struggles, *EVEN DOG MOMS* and it's not that serious\". At one point I did tell my sister to shut the fuck up but she kept at it. My wife full snaps. Stands up from the table, slams her fists and starts berating my sister saying \"I don't give a flying fuck about your mutts, nor do I care to hear about your imaginary struggles of being a mom when you don't have children and have never almost fucking died and lost your baby at the same god damn time.\" This led to her screaming at my sister to get out of the house and told her she had better never show her face here again. I have never seen my wife like this. It was clearly bottled for a long time. Everyone was silent. I told my wife to calm down and stop engaging with the conversation. I wasn't condescending or being an AH. I was calm and just trying to calm her down. But the second I said that she looked at me and said \"Are you seriously not going to fucking defend me right now?\" And left the house. She is at her mom's with the kids. My mom says I shouldn't have said anything.

It was incredibly insensitive of your sister to compare her fucking dogs to what your wife went through\n\nThis is a rough one but YTA.", "> I told my wife to calm down and stop engaging with the conversation. I wasn't condescending\n\nTelling someone who is reasonably upset after being ignored and dismissed repeatedly by a guest in their own home to calm down is absolutely condescending.  YTA", "YTA. Your wife and child almost died and your sister was trying to make the conversation about her and \"her mutts\". She was being condescending to both the women sharing horror stories in what should have been a safe environment. Your wife snapped because she did have it bottled up. YOU should have been the one to say, \"Sis this conversation is not about you. You need to drop your part or please leave.\" You did not, then you shamed your wife by not saving your well meaning but badly timed remarks to later in the evening. You chose your sister by what you did, good intentions or not. You owe your wife a public apology and a big one. So does your sister, though she also owes one to the other woman in the story too. (Is this woman her mom too?)\n\nEdited to add final question.", "YTA - your wife was in the middle of an episode because your sister wouldn\u2019t shut up, and you wouldn\u2019t physically kick your sister out.  \n\nThe absolute last thing to say to a person in the middle of an emotional outburst is to say calm down.  This is like pouring gasoline on a wildfire.  Your wife was extremely upset about a deeply personal traumatic experience.  She needed you to be on her side immediately remove the trigger from her presence and then comfort her.  She needed you to be her knight in shining armor to save her, and you were like a school teacher, scolding her for talking out of turn.  She needed a hug, not advice.\n\nSo, if you want you wife and kids back, you need to apologize for not being her protector when she needed one.  You should have stopped the conversation sooner and told your sister to shut her trap or you were physically kicking her out of the house.  Your sister had no intention of shutting up, because she wanted her say.\n\nYour lesson for the future is when someone is having an emotional breakdown, which is what you wife was having, she was not in control of her emotions and is not capable of taking instructions.  Your only move is to remove the trigger, provide support and comfort.\n\nShe can\u2019t trust you now.  You didn\u2019t stand up for her when she needed you the most.  So she can\u2019t trust you which is why she took the kids and went to her parents.  And she isn\u2019t going to come back until she can trust you again.", "YTA - Your wife is right. Your sister was being AWFUL and you made a meager attempt to put her in her place and then when sister kept going you tell your wife to calm down?? What the fuck is wrong with you??", "YTA and your wife is my hero. \n\nAt no point in human history has telling someone to \"calm down\" come across as anything other than condescending.", "YTA\n\n>**I told my wife to calm down** and stop engaging with the conversation. **I wasn't condescending** or being an AH\n\n\"Calm down\" is a vey loaded term. Your wife heard your words as a dismissive silencing tactic, rather than the soothing phrase that you intended.\n\nYour mom understands this. Whatever you intended, the fact is that you were trying to defuse the situation by silencing your wife. \n\n>My sister continuously interjected with stories about her dog and was minimizing my wife's struggles\n\nYour wife was not the one who needed to be silenced. You prioritized your sister - and that was completely an AH move.", "Sorry but YTA.\n\nFrom your perspective, you would just like to be able to have a family gathering that didn't devolve into this \"dogs are not children\" argument.  But I will tell you that I don't know a single person who will calm down when you tell them to \"calm down.\"  The very words are insulting because you're basically telling them that they are being irrational.  That they are wrong to be getting upset.\n\nYou don't mention yourself interjecting at all, backing up your wife's points before the final blowup. Nor did you take her side when you finally did speak up.  The most charitable thing I can think is that you were trying to be a good host, but you were certainly being a bad husband.\n\nYour sister is objectively WRONG. I say this as a husband, father, and pet owner.  It is just fine for people to get parental feelings about their pets.  But your sister did not give birth to her dogs, she did not almost die.  So for her to try to make an equivalence is INSULTING to you wife.\n\n**TLDR, your sister insulted your wife. Apologize to your wife for not having her back.**", "YTA.\n\nYOUR sister acted absolutely horrifically, and you should have handled it before the situation reached the point that it did. You tried, failed, so your wife had to, and your response was to tell HER to calm down?!\n\n>I wasn't condescending\n\nSure bro. Keep telling yourself that.", "Yta\n\nWho the hell let's their sister basically compair their children to dogs.\n\nLike I'm a dog mom but come on. She was literally trying to make her dogs more important than your wife almost dying.\n\nGrow up before your wife decides that she needs someone who supports her", "YTA, telling someone having a meltdown to just calm down never works. When it's a justified meltdown, it also gives the impression you just don't care or understand how serious the issue is. You should apologize to your wife and say you were just trying to de-escalate the situation but realize now it was unhelpful. Whatever it takes to make her feel you are on her side.", "YTA for telling her to \u201ccalm down\u201d and essentially to stop talking while she was defending herself - telling someone to manage their emotions immediately while they\u2019re being triggered is minimizing their feelings.\n\nYou should\u2019ve waited until your sister left and then *helped* your wife calm down. \n\nAnd you should\u2019ve been 100% behind her kicking your sister out, and hopefully telling your sister she needs to apologize. Your sister is an inconsiderate asshole.\n\nI don\u2019t have children, and I\u2019ve lost loads of pets traumatically. While my pets are my children, and I\u2019d literally kill someone trying to hurt them without an ounce of remorse, I would *never* compare the experience of human children to pet children. Yeah, don\u2019t minimize my experience as a pet parent who has lost their pets by saying \u201cwell they\u2019re just animals\u201d or \u201cwell it\u2019s not like they\u2019re your kids\u201d, at the end of the day they *are* animals. If I ever had human children, though, as much as I\u2019d do everything for my critters and spoil the shit out of them just the same, my human children would 100% take priority if it ever came to it (and this is from someone who has no plans of ever having children). \n\nFfs.", "YTA the fact that you allowed your sister to disrespect your wife in your home knowing her struggles is wild to me. If anything you should told your sister to stop the conversation or she could leave your home. Apologize to your wife and talk to your sister bout herself", "Light, YTA. You chose the wrong target to de escalate the tension. You should have told your sister to leave. If/when your wife continued to engage you should have told her to take the kids to the backroom or something, get her out of there, and that you'd handle it.  Instead you chose to try to de escalate through your wife, not blaming her but even then it's not surprising she thought you weren't taking her side. I get where you're coming from and why you did it, but that split decision fucked you.\n\nAlso ban your sister if it's not done already.", "YTA \n\nNever in the history of forever has telling a righteously angry person to calm down worked.\n\nYou were just pouring gasoline on the fire dude.", "YTA. Your wife\u2019s struggles were basically diminished by your sister trying to compare her struggles as a dog mom to your wife and child almost dying. You telling your wife to calm down and not saying anything to your sister kind of puts you on her side, and not your wife\u2019s. You should have have told your sister to shut up, or not say anything at all.", "YTA. Telling anyone, but ESPECIALLY a woman, to \"calm down\" is condensending.", "Gentle YTA\n\nEven if your wife had been out of line, she is an autonomous human being, and it's not your place to police her behavior or her emotions, especially in front of other people. It's infantilizing. I know you didn't mean it that way, but that's how it would have felt to her.", "YTA.  You should have personally escorted your sister out the door before it got as far as it did.  But then when you told her to calm down instead of walking your sister out, you sealed your own fate.  You need to grovel for forgiveness and tell your wife that your sister won't ever be invited back.", "I am (or was until she passed) one of \u2018those crazy dog mums\u2019, but wouldn\u2019t have ever dreamt of comparing myself to a human parent, let alone one who experienced a traumatic birth. Everyone there should have told your sister to shut TF up. YTA for allowing it to go on and upset your wife.", "Soft YTA. I don't think you were trying to intentionally be an AH. I think you were trying to defuse a terrible situation. I also don't think your wife was trying to bite your head off, but she was already hot under the collar and took your words wrong. Tell her you're sorry. Tell her you screwed up. Tell her you weren't trying to be an AH, and you realize you said the wrong words.  From the tone of your post it sounds like you do support your wife and so do your parents. Just say sorry, let her cry, patch things up and move forward :)", "hard situation. you\u2019re mom is right about you staying silent, but oopsie daisies. apologize and clarify that your wife is still your priority. you\u2019re sister having ankle-biters at work is bonkers to me", "YTA", "YTA - sorry it was the sons b-day, the dinner was to celebrate him.", "Yta u should\u2019ve defended her", "YTA\n\nCut your sister off and apologize to your wife", "YTA your sister is an AH but jesus h christ your sister just told your wife it's no big deal she and her child almost died  you need to defend your d@mn wife not tell her to calm down.", "YTA.

It *never* results in the person actually calming down. \n\nI had a very traumatic, near death medical crisis with my first pregnancy that almost took us both out. If I was in your wife's shoes, I probably would have lost my shit, too. It's a *trauma response* . And I'm saying this as someone who owns and generally loves dogs. It's NOT the same. Not even a little. And your sister was incredibly dismissive of your wife's very real trauma. She knew what she was doing. \n\nApologize. A real, heartfelt apology. Then make damn sure your wife is never exposed to your sister again. \n\nIf your wife hasn't gotten therapy, it may be something y'all should look into. Medical PTSD is a very real thing and that may be a part of what is going on here (and it can happen even if the medical treatment was 100% appropriate, not just when the person receives subpar treatment). But you need to choose your words VERY carefully when you approach this topic. Any hint of blaming her will blow up in your face. There are a lot of really complicated emotions that go with almost dying. Add in almost having the child you are growing die as well, and it's even more complex. Guilt is a big one. It's ok to need help to work through that. \n\nFor future reference, the appropriate thing to do would have been to kick your sister out immediately.

You needed to stand up for your wife, not try and restore peace to the table. It may have seemed like it was more important that everyone get along and have a nice evening, but sometimes someone says something so inexcusably wrong that keeping the peace is impossible.

She's probably realised that you were trying to help her in a man's way but that's exactly what she did not need for something that was so traumatic for her. \n\nLogic and reason only works when the issue isn't emotionally damaging, at least that's what I've found from my interactions with female friends and colleagues.", "YTA: your mom was right", "YTA and you have to realize that by now right? I get it as a reflex to diffuse tension and reduce any more explosives (I grew up in a short fuse family and avoid conflict at all cost) but it\u2019s up to you now to understand why your wife is hurt, what you need to apologize for, and not explain anything in your apology. Just apologize and reaffirm that she is your first priority and you did a bad job not making her one in that moment.", "INFO: In the history of ever, has it ever once helped someone to be told to \"calm down?\"", "YTA yes you were being condescending by telling her to calm down.", "Well... I would not call you an AH for your response, but I would say it was not the appropriate response at that time.   Saying nothing would have been better. Your wife was having a meltdown and at that moment she just needed you to support her and defend her.  I get that you saw her get out of control and your first instinct was to calm her down, but it just wasn't the right response.  I hope you ripped into your sister.     Call your wife and talk to her.  Apologize for how you responded and say your right, my first response should have been to defend you and support you and explain why you said what you said.    Tell her you love her and you made a mistake.   if you did yell at your sister let her know you did.  If you did not say anything to your sister, you need too and let you wife you did and you are 100% on your wife's side.   add flowers too....", "You told her to calm down and really think you weren't condescending? \nYou treated her like a person who doesn't know how to behave when you should have just backed her up.\n\nIn the history of \"calm down\" nobody has ever calmed down.\n\nYTA", "YTA twice over. First you didn\u2019t shut your sister down when she started in on your wife. Then when your wife lost her temper you doubled down on her! Your mom is right.", "Yeah never tell a mad woman \" To calm down.\" That is like poking a bear. A very very angry bear. You mom was right.  I truly think you were trying to help. Tell your wife you are sorry and you are 100% behind her. Your self- centered sister will never  be around her or the kids again- You will see to that.", "\u201c\u2026I told my wife to calm down\u201d\n\nBecause yeah, that ALWAYS calms them right down\u2026.\n\nYTA", "Yta", "I almost died in childbirth.

YTA", "Info - has your sister lost a child, infertile or has fertility issues", "YTA... that was your moment ..... and you failed. \n\nThat doesnt mean you cant learn from it. Your sister was out of line. Let her know it. If she doesnt get it, then don't invite her over. \n\nI have and love dogs and probably talk toi much about them (no kids) but I'd never be stupid enough to compare them to what your wife went through. That was a ignorance & arrogance combo", "YTA like a major ah. It should never have gotten to that point. You should have had her back and shut the whole thing down. And when it kept going, you told your wife to calm down???", "I'm puzzled. Telling someone to \"calm down\" always works. Always. What went wrong?\n\nYTA.", "Your mom is right. You fucked up. You better get on the grovel train now before she pulls out of the station. YTA", "I recommend \u201chey, baby, breathe. Look at me darling\u201d etc. in a calming voice, rather than \u201ccalm down.\u201d\n\nYTA, but you seem definitely capable of not being an AH. I can see you love your wife, despite this bad misstep", "YTA that *absolute last thing* you should have ever said was \u201ccalm down\u201d. saying calm down, never calms someone down, it just makes them more upset, we all know this. telling someone to calm down, *is* condescending, whether you mean it to be or not. \n\nyou fucked up. you should\u2019ve backed your wife up or kept your damn mouth SHUT.", "Mild YTA- I understand trying to be a peacekeeper, and I understand that you probably thought it was easier to calm your sensible wife as opposed to your irrational sister, but where you\u2019re TA is that your sister was being entirely an AH & your wife needs & deserves your backing. Apologize to your wife & speak to your sister- back up your wife & let your sister know that she is no longer welcome unless she owns up for her behavior & apologizes", "YTA because she was right. Your sister refused to stop knowingly provoking her and your wife rightfully lashed out. Maybe you were trying to defuse the situation but right there in that moment was absolutely the wrong time to do it.", "YTA. Sorry mate, I know you probably meant well, but keeping the peace is not what needed to happen here. Your wife was 100% in the right and she had every right to be as angry as she was. You should have backed her up, or at the very least stayed silent.", "YTA don\u2019t ever tell someone to calm down if you plan to have a long healthy and happy life. You sister is ridiculous and YOU should have thrown her out long before your wife snapped. A ton of grovelling and marriage counselling are your only hope.", "NTA or ESH", "I get where you were coming from, and I believe you when you say you didn't mean to be condescending, but in that moment, that's not what your wife needed to hear. I understand you just wanted to calm her down, but you should have said something to your sister first. Your sister was out of line and you could have calmed down your wife once that was addressed. Soft YTA.", "YTA. Your sister has been mocking you wife and belittling her struggles for years, your wife finally put foot down and snapped. You should have had her back. Oh, and it's Relationship 101 to never tell a ticked off person to calm down. That is basically asking them to turn their aggravation on you.", "Telling a furious (especially when she has a right to be) woman to calm down is a very very bad idea. Just go admit you were wrong, beg, grovel and assure her that you are 100% on her side in this. Also never allow your idiot sister around your wife ever again.  I don't think you are the A H but you had a really bad lapse in judgment.", "YTA - Instead of helping your wife you were more concerned with your own personal discomfort in a polite social situation. I would not return until you got your head out of your ass and realized exactly why you fucked up so badly. I\u2019m enraged on her behalf.  Honestly, shame on you. Shame, shame, shame.", "Well, that could have been handled better. Maybe start with agreeing that your sister was horribly rude, it sounds like you are already on board with that stance. I imagine your wife was on an extreme emotional rage and anything trying to calm her down while not also presenting yourself as fully on your wife's side would have been met with a similar response. That would be the \"If you're not with me, you're against me\" view.\n\nAn apology to your wife would probably be good. Reiterating her command that your sister not be allowed in your house is a good way to show your support for your wife and disgust at your sisters behavior. \n\nGood luck", "YTA, yeah....... you fucked up", "YTA because you didn't properly deal with the situation, I assume you should've known just saying \"shut the fuck up\" to your sister wouldn't be the end of things and saying \"calm down\" to your wife was the worst route. Your sister is completely delusional thinking she has it rough and thinking your wife is being dramatic when she nowhere near struggles as much as she has and you need to put her in her place and apologize to your wife for both her behavior and yours! I'm glad your mom is right and didn't blow up to defend your sister, you shouldn't have said anything other than \"sister, leave now\" and \"wife, I am so sorry for her behavior\"", "YTA. Do not tell a woman fully justified in her anger to \"calm down.\" You should have stood by your wife on this one.", "First, I want to say you wife was completely justified. You are not exactly the asshole here for trying to calm her down. You totally went about it the wrong way, so that earns you a different title of some sort, maybe bonehead? However you are kinda the asshole for seeing this go on and not putting a stop to your sisters kind of crass antagonism.", "Yta.  I know you didn't mean it that way but you never tell somebody who is super pissed off to calm down. If there is one thing it's guaranteed to do, it's make them more angry.", "You had best back up your wife on this one (albeit after the fact) and tell your sister to bugger off and never come back. You also need to give your wife a heartfelt and deeply sincere apology for your actions and also take whatever shit she throws your way. YTA.", "Your sister was minimizing the experience of your wife literally ALMOST DYING and your first response it to tell your wife to stop?", "OP, YTA here, but only for the end of the conversation with your wife. You did good by telling your sister to stop talking, but it never should have escalated to the point where you\u2019re telling your wife to calm down after  someone has literally tried to minimize the near death experience of herself & your youngest. Your intention was good - no one wants to see their partner upset, but your execution makes you the AH here - as they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. \n\nA potential future option for you - I cannot fucking stand when people tell me to calm down or \u201cbreathe\u201d when I\u2019m agitated. It makes me want to punch a wall or scream loudly, especially if I\u2019m stressed. My Bf & I came to a decision where rather than say \u201ccalm down\u201d or \u201cbreathe\u201d when situations start to escalate, we say \u201cpause\u201d. It\u2019s just a reminder that \u201chey, you\u2019re getting frazzled, I see it and your feelings are valid. Take a beat, and let\u2019s try this again after a few seconds.\u201d Has worked WONDERS in our more sensitive conversations. \n\nMy advice to you for when your wife comes back: sit down and have a conversation with her, letting her know her feelings are valid, she has every reason to be upset, and you\u2019re sorry for the way that situation ended the way it did. Ask her what she\u2019d like next steps to be moving forward when it comes to your sister & her involvement in your life. If that means going LC with your sister for a while until your wife is ready to see her, then so be it. Have a conversation with her about what you can do to help her cope when she starts to get frazzled during heated situations that isn\u2019t saying \u201ccalm down\u201d or \u201cjust breathe\u201d, and SHOW her that you\u2019re here to support her. She\u2019s your wife, your partner, the mother of your children - she is the family you chose, not the family you were born with. Good luck OP.", "Definitely should have backed your wife.  ESH except the wife and YTA.\n\nYour sister shouldn't be comparing her dogs to children but also mum shouldn't be talking about birth trauma.\n\nIts a form of TRAUMA. Just because it's so normalised in our society doesn't mean it should be dinner table conversation.\n\nIt blows my mind how much people are open to trauma dumping around birth stories. You wouldn't start sharing details of a sexual assault at a BBQ but got some reason birth trauma is OK?\n\nOf course your wife reacted poorly, she is being forced to relive one of the most horrific experiences of her life. \n\nTelling her to not engage is like telling her to calm down.  Totally unsupported and more triggering.", "Just a suggestion, but I would encourage you to talk to your mom, as someone who has had experience with birth trauma, and ask her if she were in your wife\u2019s shoes at that moment what she would be feeling. There are so many emotions surrounding birth trauma that I feel like are hard to grasp and hard to talk about. This might give you more of a personal view of what your wife was feeling when you thought you were helping. This could go a long way to talking to your wife about everything. \n\nAs someone who has had birth trauma, I don\u2019t often talk about with my husband because I know there was trauma on his end as well. When we finally talked in depth we didn\u2019t really understand what the other had gone through. It was kind of a surface level understanding because we were still facing our own trauma. \n\nPersonally, I am a very blunt person when I need to be and if that were my sister, I would be going to have a very real conversation about what actually happened during your wife\u2019s labor. I wouldn\u2019t sugar coat anything or try to spare her feelings (since she didn\u2019t care about either of yours). Then ask her what experiences she\u2019s had with her pets that are similar. Looking at the entire event, you have to realize your sister is also downplaying what you went through. I would also review with her that in that same night she disrespected and downplayed the trauma your own mother went through. There are no apologies that can ever make that ok.", "You obviously agree, but definitely should've backed her or said nothing.  YTA \nI'm actually surprised you let your sister keep going.", "YTA. Your sister is also a monumental top-tier AH. \n\nYou need to realise given the gravity of this and how you responded (you even openly admit that you realise that this was \u2018clearly bottled for a long time\u2019) that this is well beyond one \u2018calm down\u2019 \u2014 not to mention that in the history of the phrase \u2018calm down\u2019, telling that to someone in anger, panic or sadness has never calmed them down. \n\nThis is about you wanting to make \u2018calm\u2019, because you were \u2018calm\u2019, rather than truly taking board the moment. \n\nAnd honestly, bruv, \u2018calmness\u2019 isn\u2019t a value in itself. And it certainly isn\u2019t a form of comfort. Even and especially if it was well-intentioned at some level (and personally, I think it is ALWAYS a \u2018shut up\u2019 reaction just phrased more politely). \n\nYou shat on her trauma. And her rightful expression of anger and grief in response to breathtaking bullshittery. \n\nAs an aside, that\u2019s an awful lot of fucking dogs, including three big ones. I\u2019ve been attacked by dogs multiple times in my life \u2014 fence jumpers, \u2018they\u2019re friendly to everyone in my family!\u2019, \u2018oh, they just smelled you are afraid\u2019 etc, etc \u2014 and anyone who doesn\u2019t want to listen to legitimate reasons not to be around a fucken menagerie is someone who isn\u2019t listening. \n\nI don\u2019t know a _single good dog owner who isn\u2019t understanding of this._ I really don\u2019t. \n\nAnd fuck, man, two German Shepherds? They are \u2018working dogs\u2019. Those are police-level dogs. They are very intelligent and very loyal but for the same reason very protective of their unit. If the two of them exercise that against someone who is fearful, she won\u2019t be able to control them both. Particularly if the Great Dane acts out TOO, because they are lovely dogs, but can get jumpy when startled or whipped up by other dogs.\n\n(Please note: despite a legitimate fear based on long history, I am neither anti-dog nor anti-German Shepherd. Indeed, I hang out a lot with a close friend who has a mutt farm working dog. Great dog.)\n\nYou have some work to do here. And I urge you to be very, very fucking humble and listen ten times more than you talk, and when you talk, make it in direct response to what is actually being said.", "I\u2019m probably gonna be down voted but I\u2019m gonna say ESH but leaning towards NTA. Yes, saying \u201ccalm down\u201d is a very bad move to say to someone who\u2019s upset, especially a spouse. However, you did tell your sister to shut up and she continued to talk regardless so at least you tried to stop the situation before making it worse. I do recommend explaining your reasoning/way of thinking to your wife so she understands that you weren\u2019t trying to side with your sister and apologize to her, lack of communication and understanding causes issues that could\u2019ve been prevented. I\u2019d also talk to your sister WITH your wife on whatever you guys decide to do (low contact, no contact, house rules, etc) so you\u2019re a united front and show that you support your wife.", "YTA and so is your wife from the sound of it", "NTA, your reaction was natural but unfortunate. Your wife feels like you did not stand up for her, but reality is she was mid-meltdown. Your sister was out of line, playing stupid games and won a stupid prize.
