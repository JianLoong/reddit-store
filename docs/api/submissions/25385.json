He and I spent all our high school years together, and the bond we\u2019ve built is stronger every day. I love him, and I know he loves me. Since the beginning of our relationship, we\u2019ve talked about our dreams for the future and where we saw our relationship going. I am a Christian, and my boyfriend (I\u2019ll call him Nathan for the rest of this) knows this. He knows that as a Christian, I am saving myself for marriage and also I only date if I see a future with that person. He has known this from the beginning, and he holds similar values. I don\u2019t see myself dating in college if it isn\u2019t him, and if I\u2019m being fully honest, I really can\u2019t see myself loving another. He knows this, as I am very open, and he shares my thoughts. I\u2019ve been close with his mom, even before I was dating her son. She looked out for me and my siblings after my father died, so she\u2019s always been close. We live in a small town, so when my family needed help, she was there, and that\u2019s how I met Nathan. After he and I started dating, she became more of a friend. We would get coffee and gossip, and we were on great terms. As I got closer with his mom, Nathan talked up the idea of me and him getting married. I knew my answer, but I didn\u2019t think we were ready to tell our families about it. I was raised in the south, where high school sweethearts weren\u2019t that uncommon, but Nathan and his family are from New England. As time went on though, I bonded with his mom. I felt she really respected me and my values, and I began to get comfortable with the idea of her being my MIL. For years now we would get both our families together to have nice dinners at our homes, and it was always fun. A few weeks ago we had one of these dinners, and Nathan\u2019s grandparents were in town. They are both very traditional, and were making jokes about how long Nathan and I had been together, and we were just brushing them off. They ceased until I started mixing drinks, (I had an interest in mixology in my early teens) when his grandmother asked him if he had picked out a ring, and I jokingly said \u201cNot yet, he doesn\u2019t know what size stone I want.\u201d Most of the party laughed, excluding Nathan\u2019s mom. She looked at me and said \u201cNot yet? What do you mean yet?\u201d I awkwardly dismissed her question, and Nathan looked at me as if he was going to tell her. I shook my head \u201cno\u201d at him, and he got it. Later that night I packed my family into my car, and said my good nights after tidying up. His mother stopped me by the door, and began her tangent. She went on about how I was crazy for trying to derail her son\u2019s career like this, and delusional for thinking about marriage so young. It really stung, especially coming from her. Things haven\u2019t been the same since, and I think I\u2019ve really hurt my relationship with her.

I don\u2019t mean that to be condescending at all, I just know how people grow into their 20s.. and 2) is there any chance that she maybe used that line as an excuse to try & deter y\u2019all, but has other reasons to not support a young marriage as well? If you\u2019re super close, it\u2019d be hard to imagine her not being happy about you officially joining the family outside of your age, maybe the fact that she views you as a daughter as well, or even that she maybe entered a marriage too young herself. Idk. You are not wrong at all, I just think it\u2019d be worth it to speak with her one on one about this topic & try to figure out where she\u2019s really coming from.\n\n\nI\u2019m on your side but I may potentially be on her side too.", "\u201cShe went on about how I was crazy for trying to derail her son\u2019s career like this, and delusional for thinking about marriage to young.\u201d\n\nBig yikes! NTA. Why is his future the only one that has worth? What about yours, people get married and have careers simultaneously. That\u2019s really weird-I can\u2019t tell\nif she\u2019s projecting, trying to tell you something, or if she has secretly disliked you for a while.", "Nta - but might not be being taken as seriously as you think. \nHave you asked your bf what he thinks? Does he think you were ta?", "Definitely NTA, sounds like you all have amazing relationship, I just think, but that's just my opinion and I understand where the mother is coming from, I'd say 18yo is too young for marriage, even if you're together for 5 years already. I'd say your life hasn't properly started yet and I think you should wait with marriage couple more years.", "NTA so everyone else can joke about it but you can't? I get her wanting her son to go to college but yiu never said you are getting married anytime soon.", "?????? The grandmother was the one that brought up a ring? You just said that you probably want to marry him at some point in the future, which sounds very logical considering your history? It doesn't mean it gave to be at the expense of either your careers or futures? What is this woman talking about??? \n\nNTA", "NTA. It seems like she sees your relationship as a kid thing and when you graduate and grow up and go to college learning how to be an adult and get a career those relationships end and people build their lives. It sounds like she\u2019s afraid that you both will tie yourselves down without having explored any other options in life. Most likely this stems from regrets she may have about her own life.. that was more about her than it was you. You made a silly joke.. nothing more to it than that. Let it go, she\u2019ll get over herself.", "NTA I can tell that your relationship with your boyfriend and his family is very important to you.\n\nYou've been upfront about your intentions from the beginning, and that's commendable. It's natural for couples to discuss their future together, and you were being playful and light-hearted when you mentioned the ring comment at dinner. You couldn't have predicted the reaction it would receive, especially from Nathan's mother.\n\nit seems like Nathan's mother might have misinterpreted your comment. She probably was under the idea that you and Nathan's relationship was based off a fling? I don't know. Its odd that she would say that, knowing how close your families are and how long you guys have been together. It would (based on your situation) seem inevitable for marriage to be brought up.\n\nI just see Nathan's Mum's behaviour as erratic and rude. there's no nice way to put it. Who acts like that? let alone a grown woman who knows how much her son likes you? maybe she's jealous.\n\nI suggest saying away from her till this thing cools down. Talk to Nathan about it, and ask him what his mother thinks of your relationship (not that it matters that much, but it'll help get to the bottom of it).\n\nyou could either do that, or ignore her completely. You're in a relationship with Nathan, not his mom. maybe later down the road she'll come to her senses after seeing how serious her son is about you. :)", "Way too young to get married ,I give it 3 weeks", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A heirloom one possibly or a loan for a new one ?", "His mother is right, you are way too young to get married. You shouldn't get married before you at least 25, doesn't matter how long you are together. The only thing that comes from marriage at 18 is divorce at 21.", "NTA it was clearly a joke and you two are not actually planning to get married immediately and get kids asap.", "NTA.... I've seen 9 yo girl say he want to marry a certain boy.", "Nta I think it's admirable you're saving yourself.  I wish I had . Also his mom needs to realize Nathan is an adult now while she may not be happy about all his decisions they are his to make . I  think  while you're young it's refreshing to see you both want to commit to each other . I'm sorry she reacted that way .", "NTA but I\u2019m not wholly convinced your boyfriend feels the same way you do about everything. Even without his mum\u2019s reaction, you keep saying he knows this as you\u2019ve been open but that doesn\u2019t mean to say he actually agrees with you. Especially at this time where you become an adult and the world you know completely changes. _With_ his mum\u2019s reaction, it\u2019s not implausible that he\u2019s been speaking to her about it and maybe she got the wrong end of the stick, but I\u2019d be wary going forward\n\nSecond to that, whilst saving yourself for marriage is admirable, I really think it\u2019d be beneficial to experience what it\u2019s like before you commit to someone for life. Sex is a big thing in a relationship and if it transpires one of you has much lower/higher sex drive than the other, or any of the other issues that can arise, that\u2019s a fast way to building resentment - which could be avoided had you known this before committing to marriage. It\u2019s your choice, but you\u2019re young and arguably very na\u00efve so I\u2019m just presenting a devil\u2019s advocate opinion"]}
