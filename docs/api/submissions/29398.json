Inexcusable! Your nephew deserves to know that his Dad stole his hard earned money that he was responsible enough to save. Does his Dad have any hope to be able to pay it back? Gamblers probably have no money laying around or they would gamble with it. You should get your nephew to open a new account and his mother should be on the account with him as he is a minor. If she's not in the picture maybe you could be the one. The Dad is not to be trusted ever unfortunately. Your nephew is going to be so mad and let down when he finds out.

I would help your nephew open a new account or help him cash his checks and keep the money secure at your house.", "YWNBTA\nYour nephew needs to know so that he could have the money placed in an account that doesn't have access for Dad.

He needs to lose his son's trust and re-earn it.", "I\u2019d tell him that this is his sign to get help, and that he needs to get help NOW.

I think your best move is to stay out of it and let them hash it out. But\u2026 If you need to talk to anyone, start with your bother and encourage him to be honest with his son. Talk to nephew\u2019s mom or your parents to talk to your brother, if that\u2019s a viable option. Saying something is going to make you the reason for the nuclear event that\u2019s brewing.

My nephew has been working since the beginning of the year and has saved over $5000. Because he is under age to have his own bank account, all of his pay since he started working has been deposited into his dad's (my brother's) personal account. \nAbout a month ago my brother called me asking for help and confessed that he had gambled all of his son's money and lost it all.\nMy nephew still believes he has $5000 saved and is now starting to plan to spend it.

Your brother needs to see the damage hes done", "NTA - Tell your brother that HE needs to fess up by X time or you will be telling him what happened. He also is for sure old enough to have a bank account.", "No", "What good does it do to break this news yourself? I'd stay out of it. First I'd talk to the brother. Then my SIL. \n\nI don't think you'd be the asshole regardless.. But it just seems like a weird situation to insert yourself in that ONLY results in you hurting your relationship with your brother and altering your nephew's perception of his dad. Let him do that himself.", "I had a bank account since I was 14... actually earlier even. how the hell does a toddler or however old your nephew seems to be make 5k?", "Go to your brother. Tell him that he have \\[short time\\] to tell your nephew or else you will.\n\nNTA", "YWNBTA. I hope your brother handles it like a mature adult and admits his actions to his son.\n\nI agree with the other comments and here's another thought. Talk to your nephew when all the bad news comes his way. If it were me, I would open an account in my (your) name and his and deposit $100 US.  \n\nGive it to him so he can see his options and that he is not merely subject to his father's whims. Just a thought and it might really give your nephew hope for the future. He needs to learn that there are trustworthy people out there, just maybe not his father.", "YWNBTA! Ur brother is a asshole and you should tell ur nephew immediately so you or him can get that money back, fuck ur brother", "YWNBTA but get your brother to tell him, be present if you can, and your brother is a massive asshole and needs to start paying that money back asap. Can you help nephew to get his own account? Or perhaps with you being the adult? Does his mother know?", "Not only tell him but go and open a bank account for your nephew with you as the adult. Don\u2019t let his dad steal anymore money from him. YWNBTA.", "Yiiiikes. NTA  for sure, but give your brother a chance to confess and earn the money back first. He has to do both; he can\u2019t find a way to replace the money without telling his son what he did. Your nephew needs to know he can\u2019t trust his dad with his money and figure something else out for his paychecks.", "I was going to disagree, but with the proviso that the brother gets a fair chance to confess, it's right. Compulsive behavior usually requires a rock bottom point, and confessing to your child that you betrayed him should do it.", "He won't pay his son back.", "I know where I live in the US, a parent/guardian has to be on the account if they're under 18.", "My daughter got her own checking account when she got her first job at 16. I have no access to it. I do have a savings account with her name on it from the money I've put in there over the years for her. I also wonder if his dad only told him that so he would be sure to have access to the money. Poor kid.", "you mean savings account probably. the checking account we need to get my 17yo a passport for their own government doc and i still had to sign off on it. and we needed a checking account to be tied to all the e-commerce stuff like paypal", "Kids can work as young as 14 in most states.  Can't have a solo bank account until 18, only a joint one with a parent", "Police report will do nothing since the money was all under his fathers name.", "Not sure a police report could do anything since the dad's name is on the account", "deadbeat doesn't have money", "*Should...*", "At least it's their own account. Dad can still clean it out but in this post the kid couldn't. Having a clear paper trail will make it easier to hold the dad accountable.", "Where I live parent/guardian but kids main holder and must be present for withdrawals.", "Good grief. I had a savings account when I was 7. Walked to the bank on my own. Of course, I never had any money in there cause I spent it all.", "Still a bank account, still separate from the dad\u2019s account.", "I would assume the kid can prove that he has earned the money as it has been earned from paychecks. The company should also be able to prove that they have in fact paid xxxx money to the kid and from the bank account recods that should also be visible", "For the nephews sake I hope so, but let's be realistic. Poor kid. Literally.", "Unfortunately, in the US at least, that doesn't matter. If his name was on the account, legally he can take it. Even if it's his son's.", "The hell?\n\nWhere i live you can very much prove that the way i said it. Although we also can have a bank account with our name since birth, but there are cases of parents stealing money that's legally their kids earnings and the parents have to choose between paying it back or more severe legal action to be taken"]}
