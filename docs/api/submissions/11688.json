Why are you turning your back on your son in stead of parenting him properly?", "I think no one can really evaluate without more specific examples and also understand how you reacted to these things in the past.

You're his father, it's your responsibility to be there for both your kids.

Your wife favors your son, while you openly despise him. You openly favor your daughter,  while your son treats her unkindly. \n\nYou don't give any specifics of how your son treats your daughter, but it's not unusual for teenage siblings to fight and not get along. In healthy families, the parents try to mediate and manage these conflicts until the kids mature enough to get along. Instead, you and your wife have each picked a kid, like a dog in a fight. I would suggest some serious counseling, but I honestly doubt that would help you based on your responses here. \n\nYTA. Your wife might be in the wrong too, but she's not the one who banished one of her children.", "Not willing to offer a judgement, but I will say you all need psych assessments and to get an outside professional opinion. I say this because of the story of my own experience. We're missing so many variables in your story, but alas...\n\nWhen I was 3 and my brother was 7 our parents separated. Each parent wanted full custody of us both. Because we were young and it was contentious the courts put me and my brother through psych evaluations. By the age of 7 my brother had been so successfully turned against our mother that it was determined that it would do more harm to me than good for him to have us both with one parent, so they separated us and each parent had bi-weekend visitation with the other child.\n\nSometimes the kids being together isn't the best thing, but doing it purely because you don't _like_ your son would make you an AH.", "Big yta. Here's a wild thought; you actually parent your son instead of abandoning him like a lazy deadbeat. Your kids are at an age that is  very trying and they fight non stop with their siblings. Rejecting your son because you don't want to put in the hard yards with a teenager going through the obnoxious years makes you a huge AH. Using your daughter to justify your shitty parenting makes you an even bigger AH. The hurt and resentment caused by your decision has just destroyed any chance of them ever getting along after they get past the difficult, self centred teenage years.", "NTA. I think there are 1000s of girls out there who wished someone did this for them.", "I'll probably get down voted for this but I'm going with NTA. Ops daughter asked not to be around her brother.

YTA and you are just as equally bad parent as your ex.", "Something else is going on between OPs kids. OP needs to reach out to counselors, to the schools, to relatives, and to his kids\u2019 friends and learn more about the dynamics between his kids.

My kids fought alot growing up, depending on the ages at the time. But god forbid if someone did or said something about their sibling, they always banned together in the outside world. I think it is kids just being kids. He is 16..she is 14..Yeah, hes going to treat her some kind of way. But YOU are an adult, and are abandoning your son. That makes you the ass here.

Bad as your ex.", "Not enough info for me to judge.  I do think in the short term while everyone gets into therapy to find out what is going on giving the daughter a place where she feels protected is a good idea.  I don't think this should be couched as a long term solution until the issue has been fully explored in therapy.  It sounds as though you are saying your wife has a golden child and a scapegoat.  If that is the case, you need to be prepared that she may never take any ownership of this issue, and you need to accept some for allowing it to go for so long.", "YTA because it sounds like you were never present as a parent.

You have to understand, it isn't his fault. Cultures that have the mindset that men \"are precious, head of house hold, breadwinner, etc.\" Create these situations you are in. You say your family does it, so they probably brought you up this way, too. It isn't your son's fault that the people who are supposed to guide him have created someone who harms their sister.

In your home, you have the chance to make sure consequences are given when bad behavior is exposed. I think your children should also see a therapist.\n\nYou worry for your child but in your home you can watch them both. You can start putting your foot down. Now that you are aware, you have a duty to help both your children. Unless he is abusing her in some way, you need to help both your kids. I'm going to go with TA because even if you don't like your kid, that doesn't mean you get to stop parenting them when they are difficult to deal with. Especially when you haven't done all you can.", "For example she stutters(not sure if this is the right word. My english isn't very good) and he likes to make fun of it to a point that she won't talk whenever he is around\n\nOr \n\nHe knows about her self esteem issues and constantly tells her she is ugly\n\nI tried talking to him and punishments but my ex wouldn't enforce it. What is the point of gtounding him if his mom is just going to let him go out??", "I don't know what people actually in this situation are meant to do. \n\nMy dad showered my brother in gifts and expensive holidays and he turned into a brat. Even when they were together my brothers mum couldn't fix the mess my dad had made. And then post divorce she had even less say as dad was the one that would let him have anything. \n\nYou can only intervene in this situation if the other adults stop treating the kid like a golden angel. Otherwise you just become the bad guy like my brothers mum did. \n\nFYI I hated that woman with all my heart and I could still see how utterly hopeless parenting my brother alongside my dad was. Was a lost cause.", "Well she must be doing something because they are getting divorced and OP seems to disapprove of the way she is treating the kids.  What more do you want OP to do, super double divorce?", "Yup - basically YTA for letting it get to this point. The kids are 14 and 16 - in all likelihood this dynamic has been festering for *years* (and probably in part contributed to the divorce) and he's choosing now to swoop in and start parenting.", "She is a kid. Someone has to prioritize her. My son will survive not being everyone's priority", "I hate his behavior\n\nMy own mother did the same thing to my sister but instead of bullying my sister and thinking I'm better than her, I realized how messed up my mothers behavior is\n\nMy sister is my bestfriend now", "NTA, she needs you. It's unfortunate, just how lucky she is to have a parent who takes her seriously and makes changes to protect her. Keep it up.", "So it seems like neither you nor your ex have really tried.  If he was staying with you half the time, you would have the ability to enforce punishments on him during that time.", "Oh my God, *please* tell me he did something way worse for you to essentially wipe your hands clean of him.", "I would stop replying, these redditors already hate you and nothing you say will change their opinion.", ">He knows about her self esteem issues and constantly tells her she is ugly\n\nAnd you of course told him to stop and explained how it's a bad thing. Oh, wait, you ignored him?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now this monster of your own making is someone you don't like?", "Guess what! You just cemented it with him that you don't like him nor love him. You're a shitty father.  You have been present for his past 16 years but it's all the mothers fault and her family??\n\nWay to deflect and refuse any responsibility for your own son. Where the heck have you been  every day?  You're disgusting and I hope some day karma finds you.", "Good on you.", "This is just lazy parenting and reinforcing bad behavior. Step up, do better, and be the change your family needs.", "Your son isn't a kid too?", "So you blame your ex-wife and her family for ruining your son, and your solution is for him to spend 100% of his time with the people who you feel have caused his poor attitude/behaviour?\n\nYour son will likely never get over the fact that you abandoned him.\n\nYou can't abdicate responsibility for your son.", "Damn it\u2019s almost like he needs a parent who understands his behavior is inappropriate to help him develop out of it", "Make therapy and improvement of his behavior be a condition to  his coming to your house and staying.", "It is possible to take care of both children's needs.  Don't have more than one of you can't take care of more than one.", "and OP has condoned it by doing jack all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe can get off the high horse.", "How are you like the only normal person here lmao", "When did I say to just accept the 50/50 and ignore the daughter s needs? But by saying to the son you are not welcome until you change, op was just washing his hands off the situation. He could have suggested something like counselling before he could come visit. Op is the parent. We are not talking about an adult who is now fully responsible for his action. A 16 years old is still a kid. Who was also failed by both his parents ( the mom for unproperly raise him and the dad for not raising him)\n\nI agree with protecting the daughter from mental abuse first but ditching a 16 years old and dismissing he might be affecting by it ( from reading op s comments) isn't the way to go.\n\nIf op had been trying for years and got nowhere with reaching out to the son, I d say n t a but this is not the case", "It's like these people don't read or understand what the man is saying.  He said that he tried to punish his son, but the mother would overrule him.  You can talk until you are blue in the face, but if one parent allows bad behavior in a child unless you can get them away from that parent, you are fighting a losing battle.", "And what about my daughter? What would she do during that time?", "Those were just 2 examples. My daughter is in therapy for severe depression and anxiety and you think it's not that bad? Are you my ex?", "He is already 16 and sounds like he is abusing his sister.  Your profile looks to be a girl. I would hope you can understand that some girls are scared to be around their older brothers.", "bro his daughter needs him and his son has another parent who favors him. grow up", "Exactly! He should have forced the daughter to live with her bully!", "A kid who is allowed to bully her sister by their mother. He's safe, the daughter is not.", "To be fair, it was 2 taking care of 2 and now each taking care of 1\n\nWent to boarding schools myself & it's OK for a child to live away from a or both parents for a couple years", "This commenter is confidently declaring that the issue must be incestuous SA, based on no evidence, so maybe not!", "Yeah, he can be helped without risking her safety. Outside of OP's home, by his other parent and support system.", "This doesn't excuse you at all.\n\nEven if you're the breadwinner, you're still the parent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA for letting this get to this point and deciding it's better to toss one kid off the cliff because you don't like them rather than being a parent.", "Well half the time she wouldn't have to deal with her brother and the other half **you'd be parenting and disciplining him** to stop his behavior.", "You alternate weeks, one week she's with you he's with her and then you switch.", "I think saying he's no longer welcome in your house is a bit of an overreaction. You said it yourself that your ex doesn't discipline him. If she doesn't parent him, and you don't parent him, who will? How is he supposed to get better if you tell him he's on his own?\n\nThere's a hell of a lot worse things a 16 year old boy could be doing.", " What exactly do you want us to tell you?", "[removed]", "YOU were responsible for how your kids turned out. What makes you think you haven't contributed to her anxiety or depression? Have you even taught her any healthy coping mechanisms or just how to run away and blame everyone else? No-one is saying her mental health issues aren't that bad but it's HIGHLY unlikely that they're caused purely by her brother.\n\nYou have a responsibility to correct your mistakes (neglectful and absent parenting of your son). Your son absolutely needs you and will perceive being denied access to your home as abandonment. That is a trauma that will make his behaviour and mood SO much worse. Running away proves you can't take accountability and that you are a coward. YTA.", "The son needs to be separated from her immediately. I am at no point advocating for OP to let his son abuse his daughter. She needs to be protected. If you read my previous comments, that's what I've said all along. But that does not excuse OP from being a parent and dealing with his son separately.", "The other parent is doing this kid no favours. OP needs to step up and do his part for both his kids. What I'm suggesting *is* the grown up thing to do. Sorry it clashes with your fantasy of vigilante justice bc a 16 year old boy is being an asshole. Teenagers are shitheads, that doesn't mean a parent gets to walk away. *You* grow up.", "You are actively cutting your son out of your life in the sense that you refuse to house him and therefore be a primary caregiver to him. That's abondonment in my book.", "Who u thinking u are Walter white? Go be a dad, he\u2019s 16", "How often do you plan to see him?", "Right? This kid sounds worth abandoning.", "Expect in his father's home he could be disciplined for acting out and he'd get help to correct his behavior. He needs just as much attention and help from his father as the daughter does, just in a different way.", "And OP needs to be a part of that. Read my comments. I specifically said this kid can't stay with OP bc it puts his daughter at risk. But OP still needs to be present in helping him, while making sure his daughter is protected.", "Except, she doesn't want to see her mom which makes sense, considering the way she treated my daughter is a part of the reason that she is my \"ex\" now", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Because that's the exact reason he isn't housing his son. His daughter doesn't feel safe around her brother. The son has a primary caregiver called his mom. Dad can see him alone outside of the home so the daughter isn't subject to her brothers bad behavior.", "For the safety of his daughter", "He's 16, the moment his father disciplines him all he has to do is tell the mother to pick him up and never come back to OP's house.", "Then we don't disagree. Goodbye.", "Literally the opposite. Why do you think it's so 'either/or'? He is absolutely capable of protecting his daughter and resolving his son's behavioral issues separately. The point is to do right by both children.", "You're not wrong but that's a hell of alot different than his father abandoning him outright. The son said he **wanted to live with his father parttime**, it's OP who isn't even trying to help his son.", "No worries, goodbye.", "OP is prioritizing giving his daughter something she never had: a safe place to live."]}
