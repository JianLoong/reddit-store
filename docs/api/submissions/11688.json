Not matter how spoiled or misbehaved he is he has a right to be with his father and needs you in his life. You don't just give up on your children because it's \"too hard\". You're being way to passive of your responsibilities to your son. You don't need to have him all the time but 50/50 is the minimum and anything less than that means is neglect of your son.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His behaviour is your responsibility too, you need to parent your child, not just put the responsiblity onto someone else. It's also extremely cruel of you to shun your own child in this way. You sound so toxic, I feel deeply sorry for your son.", "YTA - I get the sentiment but that\u2019s not how it works. You need to spend time with him and work on his behaviour. That is what makes up parenting.", "YTA. It\u2019s clear from your comments that you were effectively an absent father and left all the parenting to your wife, to the point that you didn\u2019t see your son engaging in prolonged mental abuse of your daughter to the point it has affected her mental health. \n\nIt\u2019s admirable that you now want to protect your daughter, but have you clearly laid out to your so. A path towards \u2018an improvement in his behaviour\u2019 that would lead to 50/50 custody. What plan do you have to support both of your kids?", "NTA if your son is making your daughter feel unsafe amd her mom is not protecting her then you need to,  get both kids in therapy amd make sure you see your son on a regular basis take him out, without your daughter say once or twice a month and really talk to him.  But do not keep your daughter in an unsafe environment", "This is a bit hard but i'll go with soft NTA.\n\nYour son is rotten alright but that's on you and your ex, where were you when she overspoilt him? Why didn't you react earlier ?\n\nGood that you're looking out for your daughter NOW, what about before ? I'm tempted to go with E S H, however your intention to protect her now at least puts you on a lower AH level.\n\nPS: also INFO, did you and your wife both work during the marriage ? Who did the majority ofthe children education ?", "NTA, the kids are old enough to know how to behave and your daughter needs some privacy (and rest).", "This is outside the scope of Reddit's hive mind to answer because it depends on too many subtle context specific variables.\n\nIf possible you should seek the support of a family counselor to help you understand if this is a reasonable step.", "YTA and not acting like the grown up in this situation at all.", "Yta 100%", "NTA, because to me she is being treated poorly enough to clearly feel unsafe around him to some degree.", "YTA, you're effectively saying you've given up on him", "YTA for blaming your son's behavior on your wife and choosing your daughter over your son. It sounds like the whole family might benefit from therapy. Have you considered that abandoning your son might create additional mental health issues in your family? Step up and get involved in your son's behavior rather than finger wagging at your son and ex-wife as if you had nothing to do with it.", "INFO what s the level of bad behaviour? Is he physically hurting your daughter? Is he tormenting her mentally? There seems to be info missing \n\nIt s good for you to try to protect your daughter but you also essentially told your son he s not wanted or welcome by you. In his eyes, you essentially favored your daughter. This will not have the effect of him apologising and treating her better. It ll further cause a wedge and resentment.\nI d suggest counselling \n\nI m leaving this as YTA until you provide more info on what the behaviour is because you didn't parent him or offered any alternatives (weekend visits or family counselling for example). He s still a kid and you are the parent\n\nEDIT I will leave this at YTA from the other comments seems like OP was working and ex did the parenting so it feels like op tried nothing and nothing worked in relation to the son s behaviour.\n\nOp your son will care about you telling him he s not welcome. Even if you feel he has people supporting him. This will still hurt him. Just leaving that here in hopes you consider it. You are not wrong for trying to protect your daughter tho", "This is hard.  Very soft esh.  You're the ahole for taking your daughters side and your ex is the ahole for taking your sons side.  I don't wanna vote your daughter the ahole since she's only reacting to her brothers treatment.  And I don't have enough info to vote your son an ahole or not", "If you and your ex were still together would you entertain the idea of your son not being welcome in your home?", "Get your daughter into therapy and find out if there\u2019s more to the story. Is your son abusing her in more ways? What\u2019s going on??? NTA", "Yep. YTA.   \n\nRun dad run..... \nF U", "How do you expect so see changes in his behaviour while not seeing him?\n\n\n\nYTA - you are an massive ahole to him.", "Info: Is your daughter at any kind of risk, physically or mentally? Is this just ''basic'' sibling-nonsense or is he abusing her? \n\nIf yes, you have to prioritise your daughters safety but also get your son the help he clearly needs. If no, you cannot abandon your child because you simply don't like his behavior. \n\nI'm inclined to think you're an asshole for what's essentially abandoning your child, but that entirely depends on the question above.", "YTA... you agreed with ex that the two kids are old enough to chose.  Son wanted to rotate between the two houses. You did not like his choice and said no. \n\nYour daughter's decision should not override your son's decision. If there are issues make rules that he will have to abide by when he is at your house.", "YTA. you say your son is treating his sister badly BECAUSE of your ex, yet you want him to continue staying with her? I don\u2019t get it lol", "I think this post is way too intentionally vague to make an accurate judgment. We need to know specifically what your son is doing that you classify as mentally abusive.\n\nIs he telling her to hurt herself, ect? Or is it just petty sibling stuff?", "ESH. Go to family counseling first, if you haven\u2019t already. If he still doesn\u2019t improve, then at least you didn\u2019t give up on him w/o trying.", "NTA, but you can see your son outside your home occasionally, you know, without your daughter there. You don't have to cut him off completely.", "NTA, but it raises some flags on what kind of abuse your daughter may get from your son if she doesn't even want to stay near him and even with her mother.", "Yta", "This, short of knowing if there's SA going on or something similar, it's hard to say if cutting off your son completely at such a young age is reasonable.", "He'll be fine. My ex's family is just like her. They favor and prioritize him over my daughter. He doesn't need to be everyone's priority", "I believe he is mentally abusive", "He hurt OP\u2019s daughter so maybe he needs some rejection to see how actions have consequences.", "This 100% sounds like she is being SA\u2019d to me.", "He can start with an apology", "I'd say it's more than just sibling nonsense and could be seen as abusive", "To me this screams more abuse is happening below the surface.", "You said everything I wanted to. \n\n\n- OP, YTA.\nSounds like you should have taken a more active role as a parent much sooner.", "Sometimes teens are too far gone to sacrifice another child\u2019s safety to maybe possibly be a better influence on them.", "Yup!!! She seems genuinely afraid of him. This gives me SA vibes", "Do you even love your son? It really sounds like you don't.", "Or maybe he needs some therapy to deal with his parents divorce and being asked to pick where he wants to live.", "That is absolutely not what he's going to take away from this. The only thing he'll see is his father abandoning him, and it will justify every shitty thing he did in his mind and then he'll double down.", "He needs parenting and counselling. And op saying you are not welcome until you change your attitude isn't going to work. A 16 years old won't see that rationally and consider his actions. He ll see rejection and resent the sister and dad.", "You abdoning him. You are responsible for him. Maybe your son is more like you as you like to admit.", "Why not set up times outside your home? Your daughter doesn\u2019t need to see your son but it\u2019s really shitty of you to just give up on him completely", "That's the mother of vague answers. ''Could be seen as abusive'', but also could not? \n\nThis did not happen overnight. If he's indeed spoiled to the point where he's abusive, you've been looking away way too long. Why didn't you step in before it escalated to this point? Why are you turning your back on your son in stead of parenting him properly?", "I think no one can really evaluate without more specific examples and also understand how you reacted to these things in the past.  Have you tried with your son and failed?  Or are you just giving up on him without even trying?", "Tbh, I don't think it might be SA, but the mental abuse can be pretty hard when you have one parent enabling one of the siblings. But that's my 2 cents on the matter. But he should take the daughter to a therapist", "I do but I don't like him", "The abuse has clearly been going on far longer than just the span of the divorce. Daughter\u2019s safety comes before the son feeling special.", "The son is making the daughter feel unsafe. The daughter deserves to feel safe more than the son deserves to feel important.", "At least OP\u2019s daughter will be safe. Why are you putting the abuser\u2019s needs over the victim\u2019s safety?", "He didn\u2019t say he was going to give up. He said he would see him outside the home in the comments.", "I didn't realize how much it's affecting her mental health and self esteem until now", "Definitely take the daughter to a therapist to work on the damage and figure out exactly what happened. But her coming to him privately just makes me lean towards the abuse also being physical in a way. Like she\u2019s afraid of the brother retaliating.", "So you're just going to abandon the kid instead of trying to resolve this? Have you considered that part of his shitty behaviour may stem from his home life, not that it excuses him mistreating your daughter? You're his father, it's your responsibility to be there for both your kids. It may not be feasible for you to have him stay with you right now but you could (and should) spend time with him, visit him and let him know he can come to you when he needs to. Be his parent.", "Of course she does. But he can be helped without risking her safety or mental health. Dropping him completely is going to create more problems than fix them. As a parent, you can't sentence your kid to the Bad Apple Basket and declare yourself done with them, it's the parent's job to help and protect them both.", "It feels like you don't really pay attention to what's going on with your kids. What did he say to her?", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nYou've apparantly left the parenting up to your ex-wife and now that there are issues you're blaming her and acting like you're the hero swooping in and ''saving'' your daughter. \n\nYou're not only abandoning your child, you're ensuring that they never have a relationship with their sibling. You have the same responsibilities to your son as you do towards your daughter and while seperating them temporarily MIGHT be a good idea to protect your daughter, it only works if you man up and get your son the help he supposedly needs as well.", "I'm not abandoning him I'll still see him outside the home", "Op didn\u2019t say he\u2019d never see him again unless I misread something.", "I was the breadwinner and she was the SAHM I couldn't monitor them 24/7", "What are you doing to help him fix his abusive behaviour? How are you going to help him treat his sister better? How are you going to help manage the fallout he will experience from the divorce?", "that is in fact abandoning him", "I am the breadwinner and my wife stayed home when our kids were younger, it never stopped me being a father and parenting my children? You really have no excuse. Other dads manage to step up and take responsibility. Behave like a man, not a little boy.", "It doesn't take 24/7 monitorring to notice behavioral issues or trouble amongst your children, it also doesn't take fulltime monitorring to notice that you're not a fan of your (ex) spouses style of parenting. \n\nNow, after a divorce, you notice? I call bullshit.", "Sometimes you can\u2019t save the bad kid before you help heal the good kid he hurt \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I agree, but the impression I'm getting is OP is washing his hands off the son completely. He should def prioritise his daughter's safety but just dropping the son and doing nothing to help him is a bad, bad plan.", "I don\u2019t think they are mutually exclusive, helping him and letting him live at OP\u2019s house."]}
