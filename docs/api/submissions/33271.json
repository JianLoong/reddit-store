{"id": 33271, "submission_id": "18l2dla", "title": "AITA Delivery Room Drama", "selftext": "AITA: During my last birth, I had a clear birthing plan that stated who I wanted in the room while I was in labor and delivering. I wanted my husband, my mom, and my sister while I delivered. Before I started active pushing, anyone was welcome to come and go into the room if they wanted to/felt comfortable. When I had to change positions or be checked there was a curtain that could be pulled and any men (my dad, FIL, brother) would leave. I didn't mind this because I had an epidural and wasn't in much pain or stress. Everyone was aware of the plan and where they were to wait once active labor started. When it was time to push everyone evacuated the room but my MIL hung around and my husband asked (with her standing nearby) if she could stay. I wasn't sure what to say and I was uncomfortable at this point in labor and she ended up staying. Well she took pictures of me giving birth. I am talking GRAPHIC pictures. Most of them were of my husband with me in the background or off to the side but everything was on display. She was asked to delete them but a few family members saw them and warned me they were on a FAMILY COMPUTER that the other grandkids used. My husband made her delete them and we moved on. Well 6 years later and we are prepping for round 2. I told my husband that she is absolutely, 100% not allowed to be in there. He said he understood but that it was going to cause hurt feelings because I allowed it last time. Our dr has agreed to be the bad guy and say they are limiting it to a certain number but she is still going to be miffed that my sister is in there but Granny isn't. My husband tried to head it off by asking her to watch our older child but I overheard her telling her husband he would have to watch them because she was going to see her grandbaby be born. I decided to be honest and tell her why she wasn't welcome due to her behavior last time and now she is pissed and wants to cancel holiday events.

She has the audacity to feel pissed and you should count the blessing of her wanting to cancel the holiday events and keep those into your small and growing family.\n\nThe woman is unhinged. Keep your private parts away of her. If she does not understand why you are doing what you\u2019re doing, do not bother and waste time of explaining and trying to make things better for her. The management of her wild behaviour and resulting emotions is not your job.   \nNTA and congrats on your children!", "You're absolutely NTA. Your MIL stomped all over your boundaries last time - and worse, your husband not only let her, but encouraged it by asking if she could stay. By taking photographs, she broke any possible chance of being in the delivery room ever again. Stay strong on this and remind your husband that he is your partner and a father first, not his mother's son.", "NTA\n\nWTF did she think she was doing taking pictures of you giving birth and then showing them to people.\n\nOf course you have banned her from the delivery room.\n\nLet her cancel Christmas, Have a nice family Christmas without her instead", "NTA. You\u2019re the one delivering the baby, you get to choose who is there and what they can do/see/say. She\u2019s had her chance and blown it.", "N TA. You are giving birth, ergo you get to decide. She doesn't know how to behave appropriately.", "NTA\nYou should have spoke up the first round. Let her throw a fit. In no way would I have been comfortable with my MIL in the room and her taking graphic pics makes it worse.", "NTA! It's your decision. I don't understand why people take pictures mid-birth. Postnatal mother/father holding baby? Sure! Mid-birth, 10cm dilation, biology textbook candidate photos? No thank you!", "NTA. Call her bluff and agree with her about cancelling holiday events. She won\u2019t be expecting that. She hung around knowing that you would have allowed her in the delivery room so not to be rude. She didn\u2019t care about your feelings at that time or she would have followed the rules. If you bend to her will again, you will always be expected too. You have every right to have whoever you want to have in the delivery room and if she can\u2019t respect that, let her wallow in self pity on her own.

It's your body and your baby, your MIL can see the baby when you are ready. To be forced to share an intimate and private moment with someone when you aren't comfortable and have them take explicit photos of you and your baby is outrageous! I hope your husband defends you if this comes up again because that's bs. I'm sorry you had to go through that", "NTA. Frankly, she should have been told at the time. First, to LEAVE as asked, failing that to put the damn camera away, and if you all still failed to delete all the photos immediately!", "NTA have a wonderful holiday without this beast", "You're absolutely NTA. Your MIL stomped all over your boundaries last time - and worse, your husband not only let her, but encouraged it by asking if she could stay.

She already violated your boundaries once, you don't owe her another chance.", "NTA. She was the asshole for staying when she knew it's not what you wanted, she was an asshole for taking the pictures, she was an asshole for sharing the pictures and she's an asshole for threatening to cancel family events because she isn't getting her way. All around, she's a huge asshole.", "NTA. And kudos for being honest with her. Let her cancel All holidays. And tell hubby he caused this problem by putting you in a crap position last time.

Oh gosh. Giving birth is not a spectator sport, it's painful, distressing for the partner and somewhat humiliating. (I checked with my wife) However, I suspect that you have rather shot yourself in the foot by having your own mother and sister in the room. This will make it harder for your husband to be on your side over his Mum. Now, I am fully on your side, you have who you want, Hubby has no \"right\" to be there, let alone his Mum. But you have the trump card, the photos. That is ghastly, she must not be allowed in *with a camera or a phone.* But apart from the pictures, was she a nuisance? This would be her argument. As for the moment, keep pressing this side of it. \"Well MiL, how about you putting pictures of yourself, legs spread, on the family computer? How about sharing those round the family? Do you see why I was so upset?\" Good luck. Maybe talk to the hospital staff, they might have a better plan to keep everyone out...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She absolutely stomped all over your (perfectly reasonable) boundaries and kept vulnerable photos of you.

She'll get over it, and if she doesn't, big deal. It's your medical procedure, and it's not a spectator sport\n\nEdit to add no she asked the grandfather to watch the kids, not the father. I missread.", "Nta. Should be just your husband and then this issue wouldn't happen. Did your mother or sister impregnate you?", "NTA - fool me once, shame on you, and you don't get the opportunity to fool me twice.

You had.  Made. It. Clear. From. The. Get. Go.  \n\nMIL knew this \n\nShe waited until you were extremely vulnerable to make her request. This was no accident\n\nShe banked on YOU being too busy in the moment to refuse her and your husband supporting her request ( which he did-he didn\u2019t shut her down and throw her out , so yes, he supported her request). He failed to do his job and protect you", "This is what I don\u2019t understand \n\nYou said everyone knew the plan\n\nWhy was she allowed to stay?", "Why are you trying to stir the pot now? It 6 years ago. They talked. They settled it. Its over now. Shes clearly accepted whatever apologies he gave. \n\nI swear people on this sub just want to cause problems for posters.", "If you don\u2019t learn from the past you are doomed to repeat it.   And betrayal cuts deep.  Apologies can help the healing process but if lessons aren\u2019t learned and events repeat themselves the marriage might be in danger \n\nThe fact that they are even discussing MILs \u201churt feelings\u201d because \u201cshe was allowed last time\u201d is a real danger sign that things aren\u2019t being set up for success this time.  And it really feels like husband doesn\u2019t realize what his role is here and how he failed last time \n\nMIL doesn\u2019t appreciate the \u201cpass\u201d she was given on her atrocious behaviour if she\u2019s expecting to be in the room again"]}
