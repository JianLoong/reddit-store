Sure, you can pause and ask why she doesn't think to share her winnings with her loved one. But on the other hand, why is her partner insisting on taking half her prize away from her? This is an E S H at best, with both spouses wanting to grab onto as much of the money as possible and not wanting to give any to the other.

Her irresponsible choices could affect both their lives in a negative way later down the road, and also, why wouldn't you want to celebrate with your spouse? I would feel like I was being ignored or purposefully excluded if my partner decided to travel alone with some money they won for no good reason. Sharing finances is a huge thing about being married, and splitting hairs over what's \"yours and mine\" is paving the road for so many unnecessary arguments. Marriage is about sharing your life with someone else, they're there for you whether you end up winning the lottery, or whether you end up disabled, and needing help to do certain tasks.", "Please tell me that you will apply that same logic to OPs husband??", "Just wondering, in your opinion, does the same still apply if the genders were reversed?", "They live a shared life. She should think of a couple vacations, not selfish", "The gender is not the part to be focusing on here.", "Not according to OP\u2019s own comments\u2026", "Ah ok. I missed that. Thanks for clarifying.", "No", "A lot of people are FIRMLY working class and believe they\u2019re middle class.

If you want to travel, you should travel. There\u2019ll always be something in the way.", "So is he.", "There's nothing in the post indicating her not liking her husband, either. That's my point.", "What if they have shared finances for bills/savings and then seperate \u201cfun money\u201d. If she has used her own allocation to buy a scratchie and won, IMO it\u2019s fair that it\u2019s just hers (and she can choose to share coz yknow, that\u2019s her husband lmao)", "The legal part was in reply to the post above. If travelling was a dream she had that she never had the opportunity to do before this windfall, I would hope her husband would support that. Not all couples share finances by the way. The part I don't agree with is her not taking her husband, but maybe he doesn't like travelling. I know a few couples where spouses travel alone; married doesn't have to mean joint at the hip with no autonomy. And before you ask, yes, I'd still say NTA if it was the husband posting.", "Yes.", "How can you reverse the gender when we don\u2019t know the gender of OP? It could be two men were talking about here.", "of course it does", "Absolutely. The AH is gender agnostic", "Whoops, missed those :)", "Then YTA. Lottery winnings is income, and if you're sharing income, you don't get to suddenly decide you're not going to share income because you want to do something with the money your husband doesn't want. He also probably wants to do stuff with his income you wouldn't approve of but shares it with you because that's the arrangement you've come together as a married couple.", "If you brought the scratchie from a joint bank account, even more YTA!", "Lol, yeah YTA. \n\nI think you would be pretty pissed if your husband won the lotto and used it to travel without you. \n\nHas he done something to deserve this treatment? Or are you just wildly selfish?\n\nOr do you not like your husband?", "Wow. How can you not see YTA? You are lucky you are getting served divorce papers.", "Sounds like he has a good claim to 50% \u2014 and YTA", "Then of course YTA.", "But also, op is the \u201cYTA\u201d due to being in a joint shared income household situation.", "This traveling you want to do, is it something you've always wanted to do? Would you be alone? Would you consider traveling **with** your husband?\n\nIs there a reason the first thing you're thinking of doing after winning a life-changing amount of money is, seemingly, getting away from your husband ?", "Your spouse is Actually entitled to half your winnings though. Thats been established in countless court cases", "\"I don't want to share my lottery winnings with my husband\"\n\nIdk if she liked her husband she'd probably want to celebrate with him...", "Marriage means joint finances unless specified otherwise in a prenup, her refusing to share her lottery money goes directly against the whole point of their marriage. Hypothetically, he could sue her for it and get 50%.\n\nWanting to exclude your spouse from a fun vacation, and argueing with them (seemingly) over it is another very clear sign that she just doesn't like him and doesn't want to celebrate with him.", "this is what i think too, its nice to use money on yourself especially if you're the reason that you got the money, but why would you not want to share with your husband?", "I think it depends on how much OP won. Like \u00a3200? Use it for travelling.

Are you OP's alt?\n\nShe bought a ticket, won some money and thought \"what's the first thing *I* want to do with this money\" \n\nNot \"oh yay, now me and my husband (who's supposedly the love of my life btw) can do on holiday together\". Her reaction was \"yay now I have resources to spend a holiday away from my husband.\n\nIt's a massive snub to him.

Ditto accusing me of being OP's alt.\n\nIt was literally in response to OC's statement, \"Why don't your husband,\" and I expected it to be taken rhetorically as, \"If she hates her husband for keeping the money, then by your logic, he hates her for demanding she give him half the money.\"", "I'll at least go for ESH because these two ARE looking at the money in terms of yours and mine. She wants to keep it, and he wants to snatch it away. I agree that you'd expect a married couple to invest in most activities together. But it's unhealthy to only do shared activities and never have individual hobbies that are yours and yours alone. I'm betting that OP likes to travel, while her husband hates it. Should she never travel, since she's doing it without her husband? No. Yet it sounds like she's not doing much travel, probably because she doesn't have the financial means, and for both of them, the bills come first.\n\nI know I'm speculating a lot, but really, we all are, and I'm taking the side of her having an expensive passion that she rarely has money to support once she and her husband have paid all the bills. He's welcome to buy lottery tickets and keep all his winnings for his personal hobbies, too.", "Can you explain why?", "Presenting a counter argument just by dictating the opposite isn't as smart or valid as you think it is.\n\nI've presented you with my explanation above:\n\nHer *first* response is \"how can I benefit\" not \"how can *we* benefit\" then she doubles down on her stance in a \"he doesn't deserve a penny\" kind of way.\n\nThey share a house, they share incomes, they share a life, but they don't share this... Because... She's either selfish, or greedy, or wants to end their marriage and now has the resources to do so.\n\nThe true converse of the situation would be the husband demanding the money from her to spend how he wants. He's right to be annoyed that she has enough money to take herself on a fancy holiday, but not the inclination to take him.\n\nTo be clear, if the roles were entirely flipped and he said AITA for not sharing my lottery winnings with my wife, I'd be telling him \"you don't treat her like a wife or a partner\".\n\nThey are *married*, legally half of what is hers is his. That's how marriage works. You don't get to randomly decide \"this is MINE now\". Because marriage is a commitment to halving your life with someone.", "We'll have to agree to disagree on the verdict. I understand where you're coming from, but I have a different opinion on it. Including that an NTA/YTA verdict doesn't necessarily depend on what the law says. \n\nI never said my presentation of a counter argument was smart. It sounds a little like you're trying to insult me in phrasing it that way. I haven't attacked you. \n\nI expected OC to respond with their reasoning, and was going to point out similarities with the opposite POV. I never pretended to be smart or masterful.
