Sure, you can pause and ask why she doesn't think to share her winnings with her loved one. But on the other hand, why is her partner insisting on taking half her prize away from her? This is an E S H at best, with both spouses wanting to grab onto as much of the money as possible and not wanting to give any to the other.

You poor thing.", "maybe they have some savings to supplement it but didn't quite have enough to justify the cost of a whole trip", "if it's \"life changing amount\" why can't do both?", "No one is making far-fetched assumptions though as far as I have seen which is what I am talking about. OP has stated the ticket was bought with \"their\" money which means both of their money from a joint account. OP also stated they have debt which the husband wants to pay off and put the money into savings for their life together but OP just wants to spend the money on herself and claimed the money is simi life-changing.  It's a pretty open-and-shut case. The only assumption I have really seen is people assuming OP is a woman based on her use of the word husband. What far-fetched assumptions are you talking about?", "Well I mean if you buy something with cash that belongs to both parties it is shared income", "Eww. What an absolute grift.", "Thatcher destroyed social housing. Councils were forced to sell off their homes cheaply and were banned from reinvesting in building new homes. Now 3 people pay \u00a31500 on a three-bed flat in Edinburgh because the banks won\u2019t let them pay \u00a3500 on a mortgage by themselves and private landlords have hoovered up all the housing stock.\n\nDon\u2019t vote Tory", "Isn't that just the difference between upper class vs below that?  \n\nSo middle class would be those who have comfortable lives while working 40 hr weeks and can handle emergency bills.", "They live paycheck to paycheck AND in debt, and she wants to travel?  I would suggest that she pay off their debt, establish an emergency fund, and make some well advised investments.  That way they won\u2019t be out of money and still broke all the time.  And as for not sharing with her husband, just go ahead and file for divorce and see how the judge comes down on how to split the lottery winnings.  No point in being married if you want to cut your husband out the first time you have two nickels to rub together.", "Im just guessing she have removed the part on how much money it was after?", "I think the amount truly matters though.\n\nIf my husband won $7K sure I might ask him if we can go on a beautiful trip the both of us.\n\nIf he only won $2K though I probably wouldn't ask for anything - maybe a nice day out/date night lol", "Unless he makes more and insisted on keeping finances separate, which I don't think is the case here.", "I've been browsing this sub for several years now. You'd really have to be ignoring all the YTAs women OPs get to think that true.\n\nHell, I had someone make that argument the other day (would it be the same result if the genders were switched from F to M), and they obviously hadn't even *looked*, because literally every single judgment had been YTA.

A prize is not income.", "As I said, selling the council housing was wrong. I don't disagree at all. The right was actually abolished in Scotland using devolved powers, though not before a lot was lost unfortunately.\n\n\nAnd yes, don't vote tory. My only point here is that a mortgage isn't generally worse than renting. But social housing should not be used for cheap purchases. The advertised route should have been that people use the breathing room, to save for their own house if its something they want.\n\n\nThat would actually be beneficial to society as well, since them buying their own house frees up a council house for someone else in need.", "Dave Ramsey has entered the chat", "It's in a comment as \"in the tens of thousands\"", "Someone asked how much they both work, how much they won, and if they had any debt.
