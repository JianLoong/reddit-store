There are a lot of reasons why people don\u2019t drink alcohol, many of which people may have difficulty talking about. Possible pregnancy is only one of them.

Pregnancy is often very private in the early stages. \n3. Even if she is pregnant, you have no idea if she wants to keep the baby or if the baby is healthy. These are both really sensitive topics that you shouldn't force yourself into \n4. What if she was and wanted to make an announcement? You've now spoiled it. \n\nList goes on.\n\nETA: I have two girls and NO plans to \"try for a boy\". Having two children of the same gender is not a burden or disadvantage to be \"fixed\".", "YTA. The same goes with the mom.

They say they're done having kids, but you know they really want to try for a boy? Who the hell do you think you are?", "There may be something going on you don't know about.  She may have just gained weight.  She may be pregnant and in the middle of a miscarriage. You don't know. Maybe she's trying to be healthy.  Maybe she drinks a little too much. Maybe she knows someone who drinks a d decided not to herself. Maybe she watched an after school special. That is not the right question to ask. Especially if someone just didn't want to drink.

You have no right to this information. \n\nAnd stop monitoring people who drink or don't.

She could just not want a drink. \n\nAnd none of that would be any of your damn business.", "YTA - First of all, \"No\" is a complete sentence. When an adult says that don't want to do something, respect their boundaries and comply. Don't be nosy and ask why because their reasoning isn't  your business. Second, even if she was pregnant, it is her right to share that information when and to whom she wanted. You NEVER ask a person if they are pregnant because it isn't your business. It doesn't matter how close the family is, people have the right to privacy and boundaries. Third, your \"I don't see why this is a big deal\" edit makes you even more of an AH because now you have asked the question, the consensus is overwhelmingly not what you wanted to hear and rather than taking the criticism and self-correcting, you are just doubling down. Not seeing the big deal is the excuse of unrepetant AHs.", "YTA. And a dumbass.

Really you know that despite them saying they don't. It's none of your dam business. When they say they are doing having babies thats their choice and not up for discussion. The only people who get to decide if they have more babies is the fucking couple. You need to concentrate on yourself and keep your nose out of others peoples business.

Yeah? Or are you trying to play \" gotcha\"? Because nothing you wrote sounds like you're excited for her", "I agree with everything here \n\nI also have two girls and people must have no imagination if they think everyone wants one of each.\n\nI hated when people (even family) asked me if I was pregnant, I'd had so many miscarriages that I wanted to tell when I felt confident the baby would actually come.
