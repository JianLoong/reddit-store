There are a lot of reasons why people don\u2019t drink alcohol, many of which people may have difficulty talking about. Possible pregnancy is only one of them.

Pregnancy is often very private in the early stages. \n3. Even if she is pregnant, you have no idea if she wants to keep the baby or if the baby is healthy. These are both really sensitive topics that you shouldn't force yourself into \n4. What if she was and wanted to make an announcement? You've now spoiled it. \n\nList goes on.\n\nETA: I have two girls and NO plans to \"try for a boy\". Having two children of the same gender is not a burden or disadvantage to be \"fixed\".", "YTA. The same goes with the mom. It isn't any of your business if they want a baby or not, and your sister most likely is annoyed that you would ask something like that when she clearly said she was done with children.", "YTA. They say they're done having kids, but you know they really want to try for a boy? Who the hell do you think you are?", "There may be something going on you don't know about.  She may have just gained weight.  She may be pregnant and in the middle of a miscarriage. You don't know. Maybe she's trying to be healthy.  Maybe she drinks a little too much. Maybe she knows someone who drinks a d decided not to herself. Maybe she watched an after school special. That is not the right question to ask. Especially if someone just didn't want to drink. A woman can choose not to drink and not be pregnant. Crazy as that sounds.\n\nYTA.

If she is she can reveal that info on her own schedule. As to your whole \"I didn't ask her in front of anyone else\" that doesn't matter. You have no right to this information. \n\nAnd stop monitoring people who drink or don't.

She could just not want a drink. \n\nAnd none of that would be any of your damn business.", "YTA - First of all, \"No\" is a complete sentence. When an adult says that don't want to do something, respect their boundaries and comply. Don't be nosy and ask why because their reasoning isn't  your business. Second, even if she was pregnant, it is her right to share that information when and to whom she wanted. You NEVER ask a person if they are pregnant because it isn't your business. It doesn't matter how close the family is, people have the right to privacy and boundaries. Third, your \"I don't see why this is a big deal\" edit makes you even more of an AH because now you have asked the question, the consensus is overwhelmingly not what you wanted to hear and rather than taking the criticism and self-correcting, you are just doubling down. Not seeing the big deal is the excuse of unrepetant AHs.", "YTA. And a dumbass.

I think it would be a different story if you were simply excited for another niece or nephew. But him this has more the vibe of \u201cmy sister and BIL are sexist and want a boy too like me and I feel smug for calling them out on it\u201d rather than any actual joy about a baby.\n\nI\u2019ve never asked my OWN sister, any other relative, or any friend if she was pregnant. I assume that people will tell me when they want me to know, and if they want to keep something like pregnancy to themselves, I shouldn\u2019t pry.", "Yta. What do you care. Unless you\u2019re going to support the child, butt out!", "YTA because one of two things is true. \n            \nA) she's pregnant and is clearly opting not to tell you.\n          \nB) she's not pregnant and is having some kind of medical situation she doesn't want to talk about.   \n\n\nEither way, your comment wasn't helpful.", "Your poor children. No one wants a chav as a parent.", "I know you are stupid but surely you know the rule about not announcing a pregnancy during the first term? I hope your children didn't inherit your IQ....", "YTA\nthere is no reason to ask why someone isn't drinking, it's like walking up to someone and asking \"why don't you smoke meth?\"\nAlcohol is a substance that has ruined many life's, don't be so concerned on why someone doesn't want to", "yes, mind your fucking business. if your that close of a family they would have told you", "Your edit tells me you came here for reassurance that you were right not judgement. YTA. I don\u2019t care if you are close to your family, people don\u2019t owe you personal info.", ">My sister and her husband said they're done having kids, but I don't believe them. I know they want to try for a boy. \n\nThis has the same energy as telling childfree folks that they'll change their mind. \n\n>Last week when the entire family met for dinner she didn't drink. She always drinks.\n\nI also used to always drink. Now I don't.  No one reason, just didn't feel like it. I must be pregnant!  \n\n>(1) it's personal when to tell people, and (2) people want to tell people in a certain way.\n\nIt's almost like baby announcements are a thing. \n\n>Our mom said she's sure she's pregnant too\n\nYes, but does your mum have the sense to keep her speculations to herself?  Or is she just as invasive?\n\n>We're a close family and tell each other everything.\n\nAlternative theory, your family overshares, and demands that of all involved.  Even if your sister is pregnant, it's still her choice when and where to share it.  \n\nYTA.", "The ONLY time you ask if a woman if she is pregnant is if you see the babies head crowning and you're sitting between her knees like Johnny Bench. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "They say they\u2019re done. You say you KNOW they\u2019re trying for a boy and even mentioned that you have a boy and a girl while she only has girls. You have issues. And btw you\u2019re totally the AH. Asking if someone\u2019s pregnant is only acceptable if you\u2019re working in the medical field and are about to perform any procedure in which that is a factor.", "Yta", "NTA. Omg people, it's her sister, not some random woman. That means she knows about sisters traits, and it was a sudden question.

I \u201calways drink\u201d as well. I knew this would probably come up as a topic of conversation, because I too have a large very close family. Even preparing myself for this question to be asked didn\u2019t make it less annoying or invasive when it was asked multiple times throughout the evening. \n\nYour sister has expressed to you that she\u2019s done having kids and as far as you know, that\u2019s the truth. Until she says differently, that\u2019s the truth.

Loads of rounds of fertility treatment. I have endometriosis and PCOS. \n\nI am fatter than I should be, and often bloat to the point of looking pregnant. \n\nPeople will ask \"are you pregnant?\" Or say things like \"you can always try again\". \n\nThose things are hurtful. \n\nIf your sisters having gynaecological issues, or if she's pregnant or even if there's nothing going on you should NEVER comment on it. \n\nIf she wants to tell you she will. \n\nYTA big time", "YTA for literally everything you said. \"but I don't believe them. I know they want to try for a boy.\" AH. \"I asked her point blank if she was pregnant.\" AH. points (1) and (2) are correct. AH. \"mom said she's sure she's pregnant too.\" who cares???? Doesn't matter. Both of you should stop speculating and mind your own damn business.  AHs. \"I don't see why this is a big deal\" YTAAAAAA. You're asking incredibly personal questions and assume you know everything about your sister and don't respect her privacy; with how nosey you are I'm certain your sister DOES NOT tell you \"everything\" and nor should she. Grow the hell up. Butt out. Stop assuming you know what others want or have going on in their life.", "I have a belly on me and I get asked often if I\u2019m pregnant. It\u2019s annoying and when I say no they have the decency to look embarrassed.\n\nIts rude to ask women if they\u2019re pregnant because of the insinuation that they\u2019re showing. And even if it wasn\u2019t, I\u2019m confused about why it matters so much to you that you\u2019d willfully ask a potentially offensive question you\u2019ve been given the answer to.

Have they ever said anything like that? \nPlus there are a lot of reasons not to drink. \nEven if she is, you come have ruined the surprise, she might have been and lost it and you asking poured salt in the wound, she's not able to keep it for whatever reason, or she simply doesn't want you to know.", "YTA. \n\nNever ask someone if they\u2019re pregnant. Ever. Don\u2019t. Just don\u2019t do it. \n\nBut also: plenty of reasons why people don\u2019t drink, pregnancy is but only one of them. I haaaaaate when this is where people\u2019s minds go when I don\u2019t drink. I\u2019m not drinking for a lot of reasons, all of which are no one\u2019s business. That applies to this situation.

Even Sheldon knows it's rude to ask.", "Agreed. Everytime I think someone might be pregnant I just keep the thought to myself and if I am right AND everything goes right there will be a baby soon enough (or formal pregnancy announcement) to confirm my suspicion.
