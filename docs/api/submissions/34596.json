My family, including my mother in law (53F) are throwing my a baby shower with all my friends and close family. As she is part of the party planning committee my MIL knew the theme before hand and bought an over the top dress (basically a gown) for herself to wear to the baby shower before I did. I recently showed her the dress I had purchased and it's basically a shorter and less fancy version of her dress. I told her that for a house her dress might be a little too much and that my mom, and other guests were wearing something more simple. She keeps responding with \"it's not the fancy\" and then indirectly told her that her dress is too much because it's fancier than mine. She keeps dismissing my feelings so I straight up said that baby showers are for moms not grandmas. Am I the AH and am I overreacting over a dress? My family is split between her side and my side. \n\nSide note: my MIL is a lovely person and we normally get along but she definitely has first person energy and loves going over the top for everything, including gifts that she gives me and my husband. I know she's not doing this to be manipulative or mean but I can't help but be bothered that she will be upstaging me for my own Baby Shower.", "created_utc": 1704722249, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191lsa5/aitah_for_telling_my_mil_that_baby_showers_are/", "score": 1863, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Many where some people were dressed fancier than the mom-to-be.  Baby bump trumps over the top attire every time.  \n\nIf this is her thing, going over the top for everything, people who know her know this.  Worst case, she gets some obligatory compliments on the dress while people mentally roll their eyes.  Best case, people just mentally roll their eyes.  In any case, focus will quickly shift back to the bump.  \n\nIs fighting with her over this worth damaging the relationship?  You say she\u2019s not doing this to be manipulative or mean.  She\u2019s just over the top.  \n\nI don\u2019t know that being upset makes you an A H.  You just have to decide if this is a hill to die on.", "This is not a fight worth having. It's a baby shower. It's not a wedding. She's overshadowing you. Are you kidding? It's a nice dress in her house since she wants to have some fun. You're the one with the pregnant belly. I have a feeling people know who is the star. She's planning it. She's hosting it. Just let her have this small little thing. You are thinking too much into it. She's happy that she's going to be grandma and she's there with you a party. Just be grateful and don't start issues over. Truly nothing things. And if it's that big a deal for you then have someone else throw the party or don't have one. And actually the party is not for the mother. It's not for the grandmother. It's for the baby to celebrate its birth and to give the parents some items that would help them take care of the baby. Because if you weren't pregnant, there never be a party.\n\nNta, but Don't start potential problems over.

Baby showers seem like nightmares to attend for things like that. \n\nYTA I guess for overreacting to an outfit at an event people attend because of obligation.

Not a wedding. There are no rules about attire for baby showers. People will show up, maybe raise an eyebrow at her, and then focus on the mother to be - you.

You have a good relationship with your MIL, and you know she's a go-big-or-go-home type. She's not going to upstage you.

She\u2019s throwing you a baby shower.. who cares what she wears. You\u2019re pregnant anyway so it\u2019s likely that most people will be better dressed than you.

I\u2019d probably find it more sweet than anything else?

You are the center of attention at this party. She could be wearing a ball gown and tiara and it still would be your day.

Give it a rest. Unless she\u2019s miraculously pregnant as well she can\u2019t upstage you at your baby shower. Guests will know who it\u2019s for.

OP's baby bump is still the star of this whole show.", "I really want to see the dresses.", "YTA. You don't  want to be overshadowed? At a BABY SHOWER? FFS, if she looks over-the-top, who cares?", "I\u2019m so curious about what this dress looks like. \n\nHonestly I\u2019d love it people wore ball gowns to my baby shower while I wore comfy clothes. I think that sounds like a great theme. I love people looking fancy as long as I don\u2019t have to. \n\nShe\u2019ll either look silly or like a fun grandma. She will not upstage you, either way.", "I don't even understand this. Why do care what she wears?", "YTA.  How could a dress possibly upstage your baby bump and glowing face. Calm down. If she's normally not hard to get along with and you like her, just let it go.", "Yeah YTA. It's a dress so what?", "It's not a wedding so there's not a dress code. Let her wear what she wants and if people think it looks weird or she feels uncomfortable that'll be her problem.", "Oh this is ridiculous. YTA and massively overreacting. I can\u2019t even imagine being so emotionally fragile. Absolutely wild to me.

You're the pregnant person, so no one is going to \"upstage\" you. It isn't a wedding.", "NTA.  Possibly mild overreacting, but you've got a lot on your plate, so that's ok.

She has bad posture and doesn\u2019t suck in her stomach so she ended up looking more pregnant than me. Everyone else was in jeans and sweaters except me (I wore a long blue floral maternity dress) so she ended up looking like the second mom-to-be, if the shower were for a girl instead of a boy. I wasn\u2019t offended because clearly everyone was there for me, but I did think she looked completely ridiculous. \n\nAnyway NAH. You have enough to worry about growing a baby, you don\u2019t need to stress if your MIL wants to embarrass herself. That said, maybe suggest a SIL (if you have one) talk to her?

Don\u2019t be that petty AH, choose your battles wisely.", "YTA Like so many have said, it's not a wedding it's just a shower and she's not stealing the show unless you let her. I would hype her up. Gush. Be excited about the baby and focus on that.\n\n\nYou saw her dress first and then got yourself one*similar but shorter*? Ok that's cool clearly you have shared ideas about the style but not the execution. It's not ok that you are trying to shit on her over it. You say yourself that she is a \"lovely person and we normally get along\".... so why is this the hill you want to start a fight on?", "As a parent you are going to need to learn how to choose your battles. And this one is not worth having. You're clearly the star of the show. Everyone knows it. Let MIL wear her ridiculous gown and move on.", "If you know she's not malicious about it, then let her be. Some of my older relatives tend to over dress and we're so used to it that we don't even blink an eye if they be showing up in suits and ties, cocktail dresses and sometimes formal wears to family parties, church parties, or the bars while the rest of us are all in casuals. We just exclaim that their outfit looks so nice.", "As a parent, you\u2019re going to learn there are times that you need to pick and choose your battles.

You're looking for something to be annoyed with. YTA.", "soft YTA . You are the mom-to-be.

You could show up in a sack, as long as you\u2019re pregnant you\u2019ll be the center of attention.

Seems petty.", "YTA it\u2019s not like it\u2019s your wedding. Besides the only reason people even have baby showers is to get free shit from others cause they can\u2019t afford their kid.", "NTA. I can see where your mom is coming from. I, too, am the 'over the top' grandma.  We, my hubby and I, spoil our grandchildren. And you are right, just like a wedding is about the bride, the baby shower is about the mom and baby. Is this her first grandchild? if no, did she do this with her other kids?  I don't think she will outshine you on this important life occasion.  You will be the center of attention because everything involved with the shower will be around you and the baby. But I am sure that others will remark on how she is dressed. obviously telling her to tone it down a bit is not doing any good.  I don't think this is a hill that you want to die on.  Let it be.  reiterate the fact that her 'gown' is too fancy for the informal occasion and that she may be uncomfortable in what she would be wearing.", "YTA.  Why do you care what she wears?  If she is overdressed, she will look silly.  Oh well.  You don't get to micromanage someone else's clothing choices.  Enjoy dressing the baby while baby won't express an opinion, because in my experience, it isn't long enough lol.", "YTA. You know her style is already to go \u201cabove average\u201d. It\u2019s not event/trying to upstage you specific. Do you really think people will fawn all over her and ignore you? Dial it back. You\u2019re causing unnecessary rift. Or go get a cuter outfit.", "YTA. All the attention will be on you at this shower. It\u2019s for the baby who is inside you right now. There is no chance of being upstaged by MIL. She\u2019s generous and excited and over the top is who she is about most things you said. So \u201clet her\u201d wear the dress she wants. It doesn\u2019t matter what she wears, she\u2019s still not the expectant mum. This sounds like an overly complicated event, and more like a fancy wedding! Try your best to tone it down yourself in terms of craving center stage. You\u2019ll get what you want without worrying about others and what they wear. You will soon have a little one who will become the center of attention everywhere you go.

My family, including my mother in law (53F) are throwing my a baby shower with all my friends and close family. As she is part of the party planning committee my MIL knew the theme before hand and bought an over the top dress (basically a gown) for herself to wear to the baby shower before I did. I recently showed her the dress I had purchased and it's basically a shorter and less fancy version of her dress. I told her that for a house her dress might be a little too much and that my mom, and other guests were wearing something more simple. She keeps responding with \"it's not the fancy\" and then indirectly told her that her dress is too much because it's fancier than mine. She keeps dismissing my feelings so I straight up said that baby showers are for moms not grandmas. Am I the AH and am I overreacting over a dress? My family is split between her side and my side. \n\nSide note: my MIL is a lovely person and we normally get along but she definitely has first person energy and loves going over the top for everything, including gifts that she gives me and my husband. I know she's not doing this to be manipulative or mean but I can't help but be bothered that she will be upstaging me for my own Baby Shower.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They each contributed a dish for dinner and put them in new Pyrex containers with lids so we didn't have to cook that night. It was great because I came into the marriage with two children and they had made a couple of kid friendly items, too. It was nice to not have to deal with dinner while we were putting away our new stuff from the shower.", "Are you hispanic? otherwise this makes no sense to me", "New Jerseyan here... a nice shirt/blouse and jeans (preferably dark) are perfectly acceptable in most situations, from what I've experienced. Or sundresses, depending on the time of year.", "As in mother of the bride dressy?  Which sounds like what MIL is going to wear?  We don't do jeans and fleece either, but it's more office dress like thank wedding attire.", "LMAO  old money does not do this... i come from boston old money....we are  just normal people.....", "Nope, Bev Hills usually dresses down, unless it\u2019s some industry even (don\u2019t live there but they let other zip codes visit LOL!)", "Believe me, it\u2019s loads of fun. /s", "I thought it was a reference to a Rolling Stones song. \ud83e\udd78", "Apparently it means you envy the bride/wedding", "Posts like OP\u2019s shows that the cultural norms regarding baby showers are shifting. The reason OP feels this way is about her MIL\u2019s dress is because baby showers are becoming less about the baby and more about showing off and getting gifts. \n\nThis person didn\u2019t say people shouldn\u2019t have baby showers. They\u2019re saying that people only have baby showers to get gifts. A lot of people don\u2019t realize how expensive it is to have a baby until they get pregnant which is why they have a baby shower and register for all of the things they need.", "I think it's a regional thing. For example things in a big city like Miami and a small suburban town in Utah will be different", "> bridal shower\n\nWTF???\n\nLike... You Yanks turn _everything_ into ritually choreographed formal occasions?!? And when there isn't something to turn into one, you invent something(1)?\nWTF is this, _The Diamond Age?_\n\n(1) Usually yet another gift grab, it seems. Don't you give wedding gifts already?", "Genius. I will be following your lead when I get to the point of having my own kids.", "I remember Erma Bombeck writing about the neighborhood maternity \u201cnice\u201d dress! It was nice enough to wear to a wedding and made the rounds of the neighborhood cause who wants to buy a fancy dress you are only going to wear once. \ud83d\ude1c", "IL here - all dressy", "Yeah, that's been my experience in NJ, NY (state and city), and NC. \n\nA cocktail dress would look ridiculous at every shower I've attended, even the fanciest ones. Especially since they're usually in the afternoon and end before the time of day where cocktail attire is appropriate for all but the most formal day events.", "I come from little to no money and even I know this lol it\u2019s always thousandaires.", "Wow, TIL. That seems silly, and like a big reach to make to find hidden meaning. Thanks for answering!", "I live in a big northeastern city and have never heard of this! maybe it's just my circles but buying a cocktail dress for a baby shower seems so absurd to me, in my mind they're low-key, small events", "Yes, black tie is a dress code for evening events. That was my point. Black tie for a day time wedding is incredibly pretentious.", "I don\u2019t know why you keep saying WTF\u2026?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing ritually choreographed about a wedding/bridal shower? I think you\u2019re imagining something that is unlike what we do. In my region at least, a wedding/bridal shower is a short casual-ish party where wedding guests gather to give gifts to the bride/couple, traditionally things for their first home together. Also you traditionally WOULDN\u2019T bring a gift to the actual wedding.", "No problem! It seems weird to me too, at the end of the day as long as it's not the same color as the brides dress it's just a color", "Average size baby shower I\u2019ve attended is a minimum of 100 people. They aren\u2019t small or casual by any means. Compared to a wedding though in my family that is tiny. Typically only aunts, uncles, first cousins and closest friends get invited to baby showers but I have something like 30 first cousins + spouses", "Fun fact: Originally, bridesmaids wore dresses identical to the bride's to confuse evil spirits (or rival suitors) who may want to harm her.", "It's about the mom let's get real. The fetus doesn't know what's going on. I don't say this to side with her dress sensitivity (I think that's hormones) but it's ridiculous to act like it's about a baby that's not even born yet.", "I usually wear a nice pair of jeans and a cute top, depending on the weather if I wear boots or my chuck taylors. Mainly only the mother to be dresses up. Now my cousin had a wedding shower, she was about 6 months pregnant, she literally wore a pair of ratty jeans and a shirt that she had had for years, didn't brush her hair, nothing. At that point, because of her weight, she wasn't showing yet & still fit in all her regular clothes and honestly, most of the people there didn't know she was even pregnant.", "I was so confused when my MIL asked me what I wanted her to wear to our wedding, I told her, \"Whatever you feel good in!\"\n\nShe was just being considerate and didn't want to step on my toes, but it just hadn't really occurred to me to have any say in her outfit!!", "Try something like what? Its a baby shower..\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a lovely person,\u201d But likes going over the top. Let her be herself and dress over the top as I imagine she does for everything. Who cares. If op wants to be over the top she can but sounds like she doesn\u2019t want to that\u2019s her choice.", "Your in-laws' style choices are not yours to dictate.  They are their own people with their own personalities, and that includes what they choose to wear.  I gently suggest that you start to accept their differences instead of stressing over them. You said that your MIL is lovely and you normally get along, so the important thing to remember is that your MIL is excited about your baby and wants to celebrate.  Her personality and style are not something you should be trying to change.\n\nYour guests will know who and what they are celebrating at your baby shower.  Relax.", "when my cousin died, i stopped to pick up my sis to go to the wake, she freaked 'cause i was wearing jeans... i said they could throw  me out if it was a big deal... we got to the funeral home and  cousin's son met us at the door...\" my two fvorite Ali's  have jeans on, i love you!\"  the other ali was my dead cousin's sister, i ws named after ( she's 30yrs older than me... huge family)", "1000% this. I've showed up MANY times out dressing the guest of honor. I dress up daily, I wear dresses all\nThe time and take tons of pride in my appearance. Nobody was ever confused about who the party was for!", "If everyone is in jeans and a t-shirt and you're in a ballgown, you're gonna look silly.", "Jesse James Decker gave pjs to her guests to wear at the shower. (Ridiculous, right?)", "Make it a game. Who can wear the \"cutest\" pjs with a present at the end of the shower. It sucks I didn't think of this 12 years ago when I had my eldest.", "Yes. I tried to wear stretchy pants to mine so not even pjs really, my mother wasn't having it lol I put on the only pair of jeans that fit on. She then enlisted my best friend to bring me not a t-shirt, and my cousin to do my hair and make up. She was probably just happy I even agreed to actually go since I had been on bedrest and not much of a social event person anyways.", "Yeah, baby showers are usually nice jeans and a good top.  \n\nNow Bridal showers are usually tea dress style shit.", "that's SO thoughtful!!!!", "Yes, when some friends were having babies 15 yrs ago I would buy them restaurant gift cards for them. I knew everything was focused on the baby.", "depends on the venue", "Right, so my statement of \"in most of the western world\" pretty much checked out then. It's hardly surprising that Canada, given that it's literally attached to the USA, shares that tradition.  Australia and New Zealand are also relatively close to each other, both geographically and otherwise, to the point that they have freedom of travel between the two for their citizens. It's unsurprising that they also share traditions. India isn't in \"The West\" and the only place in Europe that you mentioned, Bulgaria, has a superstition saying that you shouldn't give gifts before birth meaning they definitely don't do baby showers. \n\nIt's not abnormal to give gifts to a new baby, that isn't what I'm saying at all. It's pretty normal to give a newborn gifts after they are born. What I *am* saying is that in the majority of the \"western world\", which is basically made up of Europe/North America/Australasia, baby showers (as in a party thrown for the mother before the birth where she is given a bunch of baby stuff) are not commonplace and the current version of the thing (where mothers make a registry and *expect* people to buy specific items from it) is considered a bit cringe. I'm saying that based on personal experience as someone who lives in Europe. Also I didn't say anything about baby showers meaning you can't afford a baby, that was another poster.", "Usually new money are the show-offs. Old money didn't get to be old money by being overly flashy. \ud83d\ude02", "Tbf it is", "That was part of a Ramona Quimby book, too. \n\nAnd, its brilliant.", "IL here as well, and I've *never* been to a cocktail attire shower. Not even a wedding shower, much less a baby shower. I'll usually wear something \"nice,\" sometimes a casual dress or skirt...but it's on [this level.](https://www.merricksart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/baby-shower-outfit-ideas.jpg) Or like [this](https://images.faverie.com/cb:Twin~42e91/w:auto/h:auto/q:mauto/f:best/id:bfcf3d5f3a71601ccffbc392dec12e36/https://www.faverie.com/what-to-wear-to-a-baby-shower-faverie.jpg).

At most it's like...wear your Sunday best if you're not sure.\n\nOn the other hand, [this](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/fb/95/f7/fb95f777b30bf7e21647a6678808332e.jpg) looks dressier than any baby shower I've been to and that's not even that fancy...but that's like casual wedding attire, not shower attire IMO.\n\nOf course I'm sure there are social class differences and it could likely depend on the venue. But *cocktail* attire? I could see that for a particularly fancy wedding shower, but not a baby shower. The most recent baby shower I went to specifically called out smart casual attire.", " and lots of that new money is mortgaged to the hilt....and credit is a dangerous thing.....my bank is forever trying to get me to open credit cards...nope, goal in life is not to owe anybody money.....i very rarely finance anything... and if i do put it on my one credit card, it gets paid off before the first billing cycle....", "Omg people actually dress like this to a baby shower???
