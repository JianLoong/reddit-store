{"id": 19708, "submission_id": "149osil", "title": "AITA for picking my wife up from the airport 10 minutes late?", "selftext": "Here\u2019s what happened: \n\nMy wife was due to fly in to one of the most popular airports in the world last night at around 9pm. Her landing time was 8:50pm, no checked luggage, so I told her I\u2019d be there at 9pm. \n\nAt about 8:05pm, she apparently started calling my phone but unfortunately I didn\u2019t see/hear the calls until 8:15pm. This is because, like her, I keep my iPhone with the little \u201csilent\u201d switch on at all times so that it just vibrates. I didn\u2019t hear the vibration because I had my gaming headset on and was gaming/talking with friends. Keep in mind, I wasn\u2019t expecting ANY calls from her until after she landed\u2026\n\nWhen I finally realized she was calling me (I looked at my phone by chance) I picked up and she told me that her plane had landed early (in this airport?! Unheard of!) and she told me to leave now. I just said \u201cOk I\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d and hung up. This is where the AITA comes in:\n\nI thought it was fine to finish my online match and left the house 10 minutes later. I drove to the airport and there was a ton of traffic (as usual and as expected) and I didn\u2019t pull up to where her and her friend were waiting until about 9:05. As fate would have it, that was pretty much the original time we had planned on picking her up. \n\nTo make a long story somewhat shorter, my wife sprung the fact that we had to bring her friend home as well (which I was fine with, they lived a few minutes away) and everything was fine until after we dropped the friend off. Then, my wife showed me how upset she was that I \u201cmade her wait an extra 10 minutes\u201d and that there was a \u201chuge difference between waiting 30 minutes and waiting 40 minutes.\u201d \n\nAt first, I kinda laughed it off and tried not to be upset back at her but inside I was thinking, \u201cuh, hello? I\u2019m doing you a favor by driving to the airport and picking you up in the first place. Why are you getting upset over waiting 10 minutes longer than you wanted when people sometimes wait HOURS to be picked up at the airport?\u201d\n\nEventually, we had a little back and forth about it but I was just sick of arguing over something so small (to me) and I wanted to just agree to disagree (and my wife was also sick of talking to me of I wasn\u2019t going to apologize) so I went to sleep. \n\nAm I the asshole? I feel like this isn\u2019t an \u201capology worthy\u201d event. You can\u2019t just land almost an hour early and expect your driver (even if they\u2019re your husband) to drop EVERYTHING they\u2019re doing and come pick you up immediately, right?\n\nEdit 1: I was not aware of the fact that you could track arrival times of flights after they left their departing location. That\u2019s my bad. I will do better in the future. \n\nAlso, someone said I\u2019m an AH for not \u201cmissing\u201d my wife. She was gone for one night. I did not \u201cmiss\u201d her in the true sense of the word lol.\n\nEdit 2: I literally just showed my wife some of the responses here and she had the exactly response I thought she would (because she\u2019s my wife\u2026): she laughed. \n\nSomeone really thought their response to me saying that I didn\u2019t miss my wife was clever when they said: \u201cShow her THIS one too!\u201d Well I did\u2026 and she laughed. We\u2019re adults in our 30\u2019s and we\u2019ve been together for almost a decade.

You chose wrong.", "I mean it's. a bit of an AH move to prioritize your stupid game over picking your wife up from the airport.", "YTA\n\n*Some* things can't be dropped immediately. If you're unclogging a toilet, for example, or you're in the middle of cooking something, if you're in the shower and still have shampoo in your hair, yes, you can take 10 minutes to finish and get out the door. \n\nAn online gaming match *isn't* one of those things, however. \"Ah, sorry guys, gotta go pick up the wifey!\" is all that needs to be said and no one will look down on you for it. Actually, they'd probably respect you more. I would, anyway. \n\nYour wife isn't *really* mad that you were 10 minutes late, she's mad that you prioritized your game over her.

Even my teenager does this without being told to.\n\n2 - Your wife should be able to reach you while you're gaming.  Emergencies happen.  \n\n3 - Once she called, you should have immediately signed off and headed to the airport.  If there was something critical in the game that would have affected other people you should have been up front about that.  \"We're starting a raid and it will screw the team if I signoff now.  Do you mind waiting an extra ten minutes?\"\n\n4 - She knows how long it takes to drive from your house to the airport.  So she assumed you'd be there in 30 minutes.  Those last 10 minutes when she thought you'd be there she was constantly on alert, watching for your car amongst all the crazy arrival traffic, and getting very stressed.  That ten minutes probably felt like an hour.  So yes, there's a big difference between 30 and 40 minutes in this particular situation.\n\nYes, she should have told you about her friend ahead of time.

You know her flights in, you know it\u2019s going to take a bit to get to her. Turn off the damn game. \n\nYou showed your wife that your game means more to you than seeing her after a time a part.

Where you\u2019re the AH is the fact that you threw your wife the \u201cI\u2019m doing you a favor by picking you up from the airport\u201d line. She\u2019s your wife, this isn\u2019t a favor. It\u2019s an expectation. It would be a favor for anyone BUT your wife. And it goes both ways too.\n\nI personally don\u2019t think you finishing up what you were doing is an AH move necessarily. For 10 minutes at least. It would be a little different if you knew what time she was landing and still were late because you were playing, but since the plane landed early unexpectedly, I think it\u2019s within reason to finish what you\u2019re doing (as long as it\u2019s not something taking too long) and head over. I personally think wife is a little bit of an AH for making a big deal out of an extra 10 minutes of waiting and choosing that hill to die on. But that\u2019s just me and I wouldn\u2019t do that over something so trivial.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of weird that I\u2019m this day an age you\u2019re not tracking the flight though so that\u2019s on you and a lesson for next time.", "YTA. Not for being late but by acting like you\u2019re doing YOUR WIFE a favor by picking her up at all. Grow up. She\u2019s not your homeboy. This is YOUR WIFE. Apologize for being dismissive.", "I don\u2019t understand why it don\u2019t occur to you to track the flight.  It is standard practice when picking up somebody in arrivals (and all taxi companies do this - it\u2019s why they take your flight details for a pickup).  You make it sound like she was flying the plane and therefore has any kind of control over when the plane landed.  \n\nAnd stop trying to puff up your ego by pretending that this was such a big favour by picking her up - you\u2019re a couple - it\u2019s either something that you agree to do or you do not; you don\u2019t make such a big show out of it.  This is made worse by the fact that she probably would have ended up at home sooner if she has actually used a professional taxi driver.  If you\u2019re her \u201cdriver\u201d you should have been smarter about this and better at it.  And since you were not, no need to brag about doing her such a big \u201cfavour\u201d.

You know someone's coming to your house? Stay near the phone in case they need directions or are running late or something. Your wife is doing something rife with unpredictability--like flying, for instance? Stay near your phone in case her plans change.

It\u2019s just 10 minutes, and I say that as someone who travels internationally on long haul flights several times a year so I know travel fatigue.

If someone was willing to pick me up from the airport and bring me home directly, I wouldn\u2019t mind waiting an extra 10 minutes.", "YTA for so many reasons. \n\n1-Not checking flight status. 2-Keeping your phone on vibrate. 3-Prioritizing a videogame over your wife. 4-Making excuses and not taking responsibility\n\nGrow the f up.", "YTA you were over an hour late, you ignored her calls. She was landed and waiting on you, leave your match. She was on a plane, why wouldn\u2019t you check when her flight is actually landing?

And be honest.", "YTA\n\nI'm honestly a little surprised that you really seem to think you aren't. You weren't even on time to pick her up at the time you agreed to originally. I don't know anyone who has had to wait hours for someone to pick them up.  Just how inconsiderate are you that you think that would be okay. \n\nWhen my brother got married, I flew to Chicago. My gf had to fly in 5 hours later. I met up with my brother and his fianc\u00e9e, and borrowed their car to go pick up my gf. Sadly, I'd never been to O'Hare before (I landed at Midway), so going back took longer than I thought, and I missed a turn that cost me another 15 minutes. After waiting for 40 minutes my gf not-quite-seriously considered getting back on a plane and going home. I spent the whole trip back to my brother's home apologizing to her. She forgave me.\n\nI have to hope that you're just really inexperienced with plane travel and promising to pick someone up from the airport.  If you're picking someone up, you get there early. You check the flight an hour in advance to see if it's landing early. You say this never happens at this airport, but that's utter nonsense as that happens at every airport every day. Airlines intentionally pad their arrival times so that they can claim to be on time as much as possible. \n\nAnd honestly, you thought it was a good idea to finish your game when you new your wife would be waiting? Good luck staying married. I'm guessing you're under 5 years, right?", "YTA. She started calling you at 8:05 because she landed early. Because you were on your game, you didn't even notice her calls until 10 minutes later. She asked you to come now, you said okay, but then kept playing for another 10 minutes. In total, your wife waited 20 minutes extra because of your gaming. If she landed around 8ish, consider how long she actually waited when you showed up at 9:05.\n\nFlight tracking is a thing. And yes, you should drop what you're doing. At least I would. There's no chance in hell I'd put finishing a match over someone irl (husband/boyfriend). I'm not sure how long your wife was away, but I'd be thrilled to go see the SO. \n\nIn comments you're behaving like doing this for your wife was a chore. She shouldn't need an Uber. \n\nIf it was truly only a 10 minute wait it wouldn't be so bad, but from landing until the time you finally showed up, it was around an hour. Not cool.", "YTA. \n\nYou were even late for the time you were supposed to be there.\n\nYou said the traffic situation was usual, so you are definitely YA for not having left early enough to be there on time.\n\nAlso, flight tracking exists.", "NTA for being 10 minutes late.

He also would do the same for me. \n\nThe thing as gamers that him and I try to remember, even though it could be an important game (ranked or not), real life comes first. \n\nThe game will still be there when you get back and you will have a chance to game with friends again. \n\nIf this is a hill you want to die on, communicate with your wife. \"Hey, games are important to me.

Would be more understandable if you werent expecting an early arrival and need to get ready to leave so you took an extra 10 mins, but instead you spent and extra 10 mins finishing your game. Then, knowing you are 10 mins late, you didnt bother giving your wife a call and telling her a little white lie that you would be late because of traffic or whatever, which was actually true from your story so it wouldnt technically be lying and it gives her a heads up that you will be late. But nope, you just show up whenever you show up. Also, picking up your wife is a favor? Shes your wife, not your roommate.\n\nShe freaking out that you were only 10 mins late may seem unreasonable, but not unwarranted esp since she told you already she will be early plus the stressed from travelling.

Your wife didn't wait 10 minutes, she waited an hour. She started calling at 8:05pm when they landed. You didn't pick them up until 9:05pm. You say this is one of the most popular airports in the world, and traffic was bad (as expected). By your own timing, you didn't leave until 8:25, which means the drive took you 40 minutes. You were only 5 minutes late from the original time you were supposed to pick them up. I voted you the AH because, by your own words, you knew traffic would be bad, but you were not prepared to leave in order to arrive on time. Picking up your wife wasn't the priority in this instance.", "YTA for several reasons. \n1. You were being a tricky creature with the timeline in your post to make yourself look better. She didn\u2019t just wait an extra 10 minutes. If she called you at 8:05, and you didn\u2019t see until 8:15, and then left at 8:25, and it took you half an hour to get there, you weren\u2019t even AT the airport until at least 9. That\u2019s not 10 minutes of extra waiting. It\u2019s an hour. \n2. It\u2019s your WIFE. Picking her up from the airport should not be \u201ca favor\u201d you\u2019re doing her. You should have been excited to see her home again. You should have been tracking her flight, phone on loud, fully dressed, ANTICIPATING the pleasure of seeing your most loved person after their extended absence. Having a wife is a privilege. Picking her up from the airport is a privilege. Treat that privilege like a chore consistently enough, and you\u2019ll lose it. \n3. Your various comments & responses to people\u2019s judgments absolutely reek. I feel terrible for your wife if this is how you behave whenever you\u2019re told something you don\u2019t necessarily enjoy hearing or if you are being confronted with your actions and behavior.", "YTA.

You should have left the house and been on the road by i so you could pick her up by 9.", "YTA.  Really?  If you can't be depends on then what good are you?

Buuuut yeah continuing to play the game when she landed early and also with a friend depending on you too, probably should\u2019ve just shut the game off and went. Also you\u2019re married, how is that a favour? Lol.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019d be as annoyed as your wife as it was only 10 minutes and she wasn\u2019t alone. But I feel like it\u2019s normal for people to be there early to pick someone up from the airport. My husband has always been at the airport waaaaay in advance waiting inside for me.", "YTA and I sympathize with your wife as someone who has been abandoned without rides by family members because they were too busy playing video games (using internet and electricity I paid for).", "NTA.

But man, there are so many bigger things spouses need to compromise over that 10 minutes for a flight pickup wouldn't be worth a fight to me, so I'd chalk it up to people being grumpy over a bumpy travel and extend an olive branch the next day.", "I'm sorry but ESH.  You're the AH for not turning your ringer on, knowing that she was en route, and putting a flight tracker on your phone or in the corner of your computer or somewhere you could see it so you could see that she was arriving earlier than expected.  This happens a lot!  I fly in and out of SFO and JFK all the time - two of the busiest and traffic nightmare major airports and you just have to plan accordingly.  And you decided to wait another 10 miutes to finish your game before leaving.  Your wife is also the AH for reaming you out for being 10 minutes late which technically isn't that big of a deal, expect you also had to bring her friend home too so that's annoying - traffic aside, this could have been less of an annoyance had you just ended your game and left.  It kinda is apology worthy.", "IS IT ME?  OP just asked me how to check flight status? Am I the only one who knows how to do this? Am I in an alternate reality?", "NTA  \n\n\nAsk your wife how did she expect you to time it perfectly to get there at the EXACT time she was ready to be picked up?????\n\nI personally hate picking people up from the airport or getting picked up from the airport.   \n\n\nBut in your case.....10 minutes or even 20 minutes late is to be expected. If you had got there earlier you would not have been able to wait so it is better to be a little late than early.", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA. If you had noticed her call immediately, then you could tell her you\u2019ll leave in a few minutes and finish your game. Since you missed her calls you should have said sorry to the team and peaced out, they\u2019ll live. That\u2019s where you muffed it. I think it\u2019s worthy of an apology to your wife. Especially for digging your heels in.\n\nI will say, though, this is a small thing in greater scheme of things.

I am very grateful for that. He checks flight updates, but he doesn't leave to pick me up until I text him, letting him know that I've landed. Sometimes this results in me waiting an extra 15-20 minutes. When he arrives, do I get angry with him because he wasn't there at the exact time I walked out of the terminal? No. Because I'm not an entitled little prick.\n\nI rarely ask my partner to pick me up, I take a taxi or an Uber, and I've never operated under the assumption that she should be expected to pick me up every time I fly in. Sometimes she does pick me up, and I end up waiting an extra 20 minutes. Do I yell at her because she wasn't exactly on time? No. Because I appreciate the hell out of the fact that she would take time out of her day to pick me up in the first place. Also: I'm not an entitled little prick.\n\nDo I question her and ask her why she was late? Then evaluate whether those reasons are acceptable according to my subjective opinion? No, I don't. Her time is her time, and she can spend it however she wants. She is choosing to take some of her free time to pick me up from the airport. Instead of criticizing the manner in which she does me favors, I thank her, because I'm not an entitled little prick.\n\nRegardless of what anyone else says, you were doing your wife a favor. You planned to be there at 9:00 pm when her flight was originally scheduled to land. You made other plans that fit with this time frame.

Not your responsibility to check flights every ten minutes lest\u2014god forbid\u2014your wife is forced to wait at the airport \ud83d\ude31. If the flight took off early, maybe she should have let you know so you could prepare. The flight could have been delayed, and then you would be the one waiting instead of your wife. \n\nYour wife seems like she expects other people to drop everything they're doing to make sure she isn't inconvenienced by things changing\u2014at everyone else's expense. It's not her place, nor anyone else's, to judge how you spend your free time. And it's entitled for her to expect you to change your schedule last minute because her flight landed early. And, it was a TEN MINUTE WAIT. Is she serious?", "Going against everyone, NTA. It is not OP\u2019s fault that he wasn\u2019t aware about flight status.

And it would have never crossed my mind to be checking on their flight to see when it would land. I can see being really upset if it was like twenty to thirty minutes (maybe), but ten minutes is really not that bad. I guess maybe the fact that it was because you were finishing a videogame makes it somewhat disrespectful, but the heart of the issue (which is being forced to wait ten more minutes) seems kinda small. Plus, she wasn't waiting alone, she had a friend with her.

Her landing time was 8:50pm, no checked luggage, so I told her I\u2019d be there at 9pm. \n\nAt about 8:05pm, she apparently started calling my phone but unfortunately I didn\u2019t see/hear the calls until 8:15pm. This is because, like her, I keep my iPhone with the little \u201csilent\u201d switch on at all times so that it just vibrates. I didn\u2019t hear the vibration because I had my gaming headset on and was gaming/talking with friends. Keep in mind, I wasn\u2019t expecting ANY calls from her until after she landed\u2026\n\nWhen I finally realized she was calling me (I looked at my phone by chance) I picked up and she told me that her plane had landed early (in this airport?! Unheard of!) and she told me to leave now. I just said \u201cOk I\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d and hung up. This is where the AITA comes in:\n\nI thought it was fine to finish my online match and left the house 10 minutes later. I drove to the airport and there was a ton of traffic (as usual and as expected) and I didn\u2019t pull up to where her and her friend were waiting until about 9:05. As fate would have it, that was pretty much the original time we had planned on picking her up. \n\nTo make a long story somewhat shorter, my wife sprung the fact that we had to bring her friend home as well (which I was fine with, they lived a few minutes away) and everything was fine until after we dropped the friend off. Then, my wife showed me how upset she was that I \u201cmade her wait an extra 10 minutes\u201d and that there was a \u201chuge difference between waiting 30 minutes and waiting 40 minutes.\u201d \n\nAt first, I kinda laughed it off and tried not to be upset back at her but inside I was thinking, \u201cuh, hello? I\u2019m doing you a favor by driving to the airport and picking you up in the first place. Why are you getting upset over waiting 10 minutes longer than you wanted when people sometimes wait HOURS to be picked up at the airport?\u201d\n\nEventually, we had a little back and forth about it but I was just sick of arguing over something so small (to me) and I wanted to just agree to disagree (and my wife was also sick of talking to me of I wasn\u2019t going to apologize) so I went to sleep. \n\nAm I the asshole? I feel like this isn\u2019t an \u201capology worthy\u201d event. You can\u2019t just land almost an hour early and expect your driver (even if they\u2019re your husband) to drop EVERYTHING they\u2019re doing and come pick you up immediately, right?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No 10 minutes isn't a huge difference to the person doing the pickup, but it is to the person who's been traveling. If this were actually a traffic issue, then that would be different, but since you decided a game was more important and you had to have told her that you finished your game before leaving it makes yta, because I really can't see how she'd have known that's why it took you ten minutes longer unless you told her you left ten minutes later in order to finish a game first.... or it was well over ten minutes before you left.", "YTA and not very bright, are you?
