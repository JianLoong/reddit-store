An entire paycheck has to go to rent alone, and then the majority of the rest goes to medical expenses (I am permanently disabled), other bills, and gas.

My disabilities make most food pantry items inaccessible (I have anaphylaxis from nuts, honey, peppers, and more). For the past month, thanks to a prescription going up in price, I have been eating once every 24 hours to keep making rent, but for the last 8 months I've been food insecure. I usually cry on the way home because I pass by fast food and know I can't even get a hamburger. I'm almost always so hungry it hurts.\n\nI admit I've got some resentment to my job for paying me so little while the school constantly complains that we don't have enough subs.

I told her if it's unprofessional for me to talk about starving it's just as unprofessional to pay me so little I starve. She went quiet and we didn't really talk for the rest of the day.\n\nShe got me thinking and I'll admit I don't know if I'm actually being an asshole. I know other staff aren't the ones who pay me so little.

They were successful and sub wages have doubled since they began to the point where now a fair number of subs choose to stay as subs because the hourly rate, reduced workload, reduced bs load, and flexibility are now very competitive vs a full time role. \n\nRaising awareness of the issue potentially helps get people to support action, but you have to have a call to action rather than just low-key complaining as you are right now. Your call to action could be as simple as asking them for advice on how to work towards better wages for subs.\n\nIf that kind of collective action isn't possible, you probably need to look for other work. Tutor, corporate trainer, etc. Your current role is unsustainable.\n\nIf your colleagues are made uncomfortable by your poverty and food insecurity, that's a them problem, in my view, so long as you aren't harassing them about it. \n\nThat said, if your goal is getting a full time position, your reputation within the system is important. You are likely not be doing yourself any favours by making people uncomfortable. You will best know the situation - there are too many variables for it to be explained on AITA.", "If you knew being  a teacher didn't pay that much, and you're disabled, you should have gone into something else.

The librarian has nothing to do with your pay. At a lot of places of employment if you mentioned something like this (or even being young) other people would invite you for dinner at their homes etc or try to help out by giving you good feedback etc but they aren\u2019t going to do this for you if you make things awkward.", "Can you move somewhere else? Where you're treated like a human?", "Any chance you\u2019d be willing to make a career move? Or how does one become full time teach and not sub?", "Can you go to your employer if you know other teachers are making $5 more than you? Is pay based on years worked for the district? Do you have to wait to ask for a raise at review time? I would ask for one now or ask if there's any hours you can pickup/mention you're having trouble making ends meet. Also, can't the cafeteria feed you? When I worked in a school kitchen teachers & staff ate for like $2/day. And we made it work if someone couldn't afford it.", "NTA - it\u2019s laughable that folks here are saying y t a for making people uncomfortable when you\u2019re literally going hungry. and all of you in the comments with \u201csuggestions\u201d about other jobs or what op should be doing are TA like you haven\u2019t thought of that or mentioned that your disabled. Discomfort is not the worse thing in the world, and the fact that y\u2019all think it is is why so many social issues are not addressed. these teachers are literally talking mess about bus monitors. they can rot", "I'm a teacher and I don't think you're in the wrong. I actually look at the contract negotiations for all staff and I see the shit pay they take home. I would think the other teachers would look at that too. My school has a food pantry and I know teachers and other staff has used it. \n\nBeing a teacher means thinking of others and having empathy. It's a shame your coworkers lack it.", "This is off-topic,  but could you find a job in waiting tables instead of subbing?  I think you\u2019d make more money.", "YTA.  It's not your coworkers' fault you get paid so little.  Those teachers shouldn't've been rude and condescending about \"idiots\" who work for very little money, but it is unprofessional of you to constantly bring up your financial situation.  Please look into food pantries in your area.", "This is true. Basically his gentleman\u2019s struggle won\u2019t get better at this job. It\u2019s time for him to move on.", "I can't work in a lot of places because I use a wheelchair. I worked doordash until my legs couldn't support me anymore, so this is my only income now. It's also why I couldn't take the bus monitor job. Many jobs have/will refuse to hire me due to my wheelchair.", "You must have overlooked the permanently disabled and vast allergy part. In other comment OP added the use of a wheelchair.\n\nOP could in theory find an other job. However due to physical contraint, the options probably aren\u2019t that wide.", "Info since I clarified in another comment: I cannot be a bus monitor, I use a wheelchair and can't get on/off the busses.", "The coworkers have absolutely nothing to do with what OP is paid. . .", "They literally were laughing at people who would be dumb enough to accept a job being twice what OP is earning. \nThey don\u2019t want to hear about her food insecurities while now aware she is starving. Then they have to stop asking questions about her food intake. \n\nCan\u2019t blame OP to be lacking the energy to lie for their confort. If being honest make them uncomfortable, it\u2019s on them. Doesn\u2019t means they have to do something for OP. Nor keep going with the question about OP lunch, now that they are fully aware of the situation. OP isn\u2019t asking for them to help out. Just to not belittling those earning less, nor to lie about being able to afford food.", "I use a wheelchair due to muscle weakness, so I can't get on/off the busses. I've had multiple employers tell me to my face that they are not hiring me because of my wheelchair. This is the first job I've been able to hold in months. Can't afford a doctor to get on disability, but since I have a full time job I'm disqualified anyways.", "I use a wheelchair so food service and jobs with stairs are off the table.", "Did you know that teachers are explicitly prohibited by law from striking in several states? In some places you can lose your teaching license and possibly any pension you might be working towards (this is the law in Texas, for example). So it may NOT be within their power. I don't know OP's location.", "If management is systematically organizing long term absences to avoid the 15 day pay bump, that's something that I would file a grievance on in my union local in a heartbeat (I've just finished a stint in the local office). I can't say for sure without seeing the language and knowing labour and contract law in your jurisdiction, but in my jurisdiction and with a similar contract clause, that would be a pretty clear circumvention of the contract.", "I\u2019m assuming that it\u2019s one of those situations where the goal is to eventually get one of the full time regular jobs where the pay is livable.

I know those jobs-the legit ones are difficult to find posted online, but they do exist. Perhaps, get your resume and cover letter updated with this new job, keep doing what you\u2019re doing, do your best so you get a good recommendation, but commit to spending X amount of time applying for any and all jobs you think may work for you. WFH can be isolating, but perhaps that can be addressed after getting basic needs met, and getting ahead. You\u2019re getting out there and getting it done is commendable, and they say it\u2019s always easier to find a job when you have a job, so get on the horn and keep going! You have very understandable reasons to continue looking for a position that best fits your needs, you can tailor that to sound pretty good to a future hiring manager. \n\nSome of the telephone customer care jobs are only posted on the business website, so for example make a list of all credit unions or credit card providers and then go to their website directly to see what\u2019s available.\n\nJust some thoughts, I\u2019ll be rooting for you!", "Yes. The problem for me is my allergies (honey, nuts, a lot of fruit, peppers) means a lot of shelf stable/common pantry food (granola, energy bars, some cereals, things with peanut butter), most canned fruits, and most prepped meals (you never realize how many have dried peppers until you're allergic) will send me into anaphylaxis, which I try to avoid at all costs.", "If OP is a sub, they are not responsible for the  lesson planning and grading that teachers have to do outside of school hours. What is keeping them from getting a second job?", "I use a wheelchair and cannot work in food service because of it, but thank you.", "Subs aren't likely to be part of the union, and unions can't negotiate on behalf of groups they don't represent. And depending on the state (because this has to be the US) it may be illegal for teachers to strike.\n\nWhat's more, teachers are currently dealing with things like laws that impose criminal penalties for having the wrong books in their classrooms, laws that *require* them to out trans kids to their parents, understaffed schools (hence an increase in demand for subs), chronically underfunded schools (things have been so bad for so long that in the US teachers get a tax credit for the money they spend buying supplies for this classrooms. \n\nSome teachers are out of touch assholes, like the first two coworkers OP mentioned (probably married to cops who make a fortune on overtime; cops are disproportionately married to teachers). But many, especially in higher cost-of-living areas, aren't that far from being food insecure themselves.", "The district is desperate. There are usually 30+ jobs open at a time. They will often have teaching assistants step in as subs since there just aren't enough of us.

OP OBVIOUSLY KNOWS WHAT THE BUS MONITORS MAKE.

I live in a super poor area and a ton of churches have food vouchers that they give out.", "I personally know three people in a wheelchair that work in the food service industry. Many restaurants, especially franchises are very accommodating to physically and mentally disabled employees.\n\nYou may be in a wheelchair but that is not an excuse to try. It seems like you are blaming others, your disability and your job for all your woes. You don't seem to want to move forward and hide behind all these barriers that you created for yourself. \n\nYou also lack a positive attitude which is very important for your self esteem and confidence, if you continue to have this 'woe is me' attitude you won't improve your life.

We still can't get enough people, but it doesn't help that we can't hire teachers either and so the best most qualified people from what would be the sub pool take long term subbing positions for a whole school year and are not available as daily or even maternity subs. (Long term subs make about 50% more than daily subs in my district -- theoretically they do planning and grading while daily subs don't)", "Florida made headlines last year when they allowed veterans without degrees to become teachers. Substitute teachers in many states don't require a degree - some require a certain number of college credit hours, but others don't have specific requirements.\n\nPrivate schools aren't required to follow the laws for public schools. Teachers don't need to be licensed, and in some states, don't need more than a high school certificate.", "Yeah like when I finished my undergrad I lived somewhere fairly remote and anyone with a degree in anything (even two year community college) could sub for basically minimum wage. So lots of non teachers would sub for extra money or if you were taking a year off after undergrad it was good casual money.

I mean my standards for most things are low, but holy fuck.", "For the same reason. Because our culture trains us to think of poverty as a personal flaw, not a systemic failure. \n\nSo, seeing a poor person who isn't ashamed of being poor throws their whole worldview into question and makes them very uncomfortable. \n\nWhy do you think they're so desperate to get OP to shut up?", "I don\u2019t disagree with you. I think OP needs to keep doing what they\u2019re doing.\n\nBut what do I know, the workplaces I\u2019m in most of the time, staff have pissing contests about how quickly they drank their last paycheck."]}
