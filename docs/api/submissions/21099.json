In my district we're paid the legal minimum for the job. If you work more than 15 days at a school you get \"normal\" pay - I only ever get jobs that are exactly 15 days. A few days into my placement, I heard some teachers (both M30ish) in the lounge complaining that bus monitors only get paid $20 an hour, and laughing about how only an idiot would do a job for that little. I make $14.50. I jumped in and told them, they didn't know I was being paid that little.\n\nMy monthly grocery budget is $150. An entire paycheck has to go to rent alone, and then the majority of the rest goes to medical expenses (I am permanently disabled), other bills, and gas. I usually have less than $10 total for a few days before my next paycheck. I don't qualify for SNAP. My disabilities make most food pantry items inaccessible (I have anaphylaxis from nuts, honey, peppers, and more). For the past month, thanks to a prescription going up in price, I have been eating once every 24 hours to keep making rent, but for the last 8 months I've been food insecure. I usually cry on the way home because I pass by fast food and know I can't even get a hamburger. I'm almost always so hungry it hurts.\n\nI admit I've got some resentment to my job for paying me so little while the school constantly complains that we don't have enough subs. I've had anger building up over the fact that I'm starving, and they only hire me for the maximum days before they have to pay me more.\n\nWhere I might be the asshole:\n\nI've started being open about the fact that I'm hungry at work. I never ask for food \u2013 just stuff like they'll ask if I can keep a student in the room over lunch, and I'll be chipper/my usual self and reply \"of course, I'll just be reading, I couldn't afford food today.\" A teacher I don't know will ask what I packed for lunch and I'll say \"nothing, I can't afford that much food.\" Stuff like that. It's always true. I'm careful to not exaggerate.\n\nRecently I was in the library and the librarian asked if I had dinner plans. I said no, I have to skip eating today because I can't afford it. She looked at me weird and said while she won't judge me for being unable to eat, it's very unprofessional to talk about it at work where you're being paid. I told her if it's unprofessional for me to talk about starving it's just as unprofessional to pay me so little I starve. She went quiet and we didn't really talk for the rest of the day.\n\nShe got me thinking and I'll admit I don't know if I'm actually being an asshole. I know other staff aren't the ones who pay me so little. But I also feel like my struggle is invisible, and after full time teachers called anyone taking even $20 an hour an idiot, it's really been eating at me (ha).\n\nTL;DR I'm being open about the fact that I'm food insecure at work, and don't feel bad for making the people paid more than me feel awkward.

They'll have multiple teachers out \"all year\" and then post chunks of the year and have subs float/move around the school as needed (hence why I was only in the library one day).

From the workers. Like yes collegial support is important but what the heck.\n\nWhere I live, teachers DO do this. We had strikes over it. You know what happened? No one fucking talked about the support workers, and everyone viewed it as teachers going on strike to be greedy and get money for themselves. Happens every single time. Because everyone shits on teachers.\n\nEveryone loves support workers. They\u2019re viewed as the unsung heroes AND THEY ARE. But when it comes down to it, the community doesn\u2019t fight for them any more than they do for us.\n\nThere is SO MUCH wrong with the education system right now, and the teachers are barely hanging on to their own jobs. \n\n> I could well be wrong!\n\nThen why are you three comments deep arguing with someone telling you that you\u2019re wrong?"]}
