An entire paycheck has to go to rent alone, and then the majority of the rest goes to medical expenses (I am permanently disabled), other bills, and gas.

My disabilities make most food pantry items inaccessible (I have anaphylaxis from nuts, honey, peppers, and more). For the past month, thanks to a prescription going up in price, I have been eating once every 24 hours to keep making rent, but for the last 8 months I've been food insecure. I usually cry on the way home because I pass by fast food and know I can't even get a hamburger. I'm almost always so hungry it hurts.\n\nI admit I've got some resentment to my job for paying me so little while the school constantly complains that we don't have enough subs.

I told her if it's unprofessional for me to talk about starving it's just as unprofessional to pay me so little I starve. She went quiet and we didn't really talk for the rest of the day.\n\nShe got me thinking and I'll admit I don't know if I'm actually being an asshole. I know other staff aren't the ones who pay me so little. But I also feel like my struggle is invisible, and after full time teachers called anyone taking even $20 an hour an idiot, it's really been eating at me (ha).\n\nTL;DR I'm being open about the fact that I'm food insecure at work, and don't feel bad for making the people paid more than me feel awkward.
