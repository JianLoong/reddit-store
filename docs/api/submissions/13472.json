I mention it here, not on account of its excellence, but to make of it a symbol of sin. I have seen three or four of them. It has black fur, quite beautiful and shining; and has upon its back two perfectly white stripes, which join near the neck and tail, making an oval that adds greatly to their grace. The tail is bushy and well furnished with hair, like the tail of a Fox; it carries it curled back like that of a Squirrel. It is more white than black; and, at the first glance, you would say, especially when it walks, that it ought to be called Jupiter's little dog. But it is so stinking and casts so foul an odor, that it is unworthy of being called the dog of Pluto. No sewer ever smelled so bad. I would not have believed it if I had not smelled it myself. Your heart almost fails you when you approach the animal; two have been killed in our court, and several days afterward there was such a dreadful odor throughout our house that we could not endure it.

Let\u2019s say that the skunk got hit by a car, and then you drive over the skunk somewhat soon after it died \u2014 your entire car will reek for days.

The times anal gland has accidentally splattered onto my sleeve or worse, my cheek, have been SO sickening. If you don\u2019t work with dogs, I can\u2019t explain how gross this is. You have one finger squeezing from inside the dogs anus and a thumb massaging and squeezing from outside. The fluid that comes out can range from extremely watery to thick and almost solid or chunky, coloring from yellowish to all shades of brown to black and can have red in it, and the smell is like a very rotten fishy smell with metallic undertones.

Presumably you\u2019re in this field because you want to help animals, why are you trying to make it so that the animals in your care have less support? Do you think the dog, who was already in a stressful position, would have enjoyed any possible reaction this could have elicited?

Still dumbfounded that they were genuinely shocked I quit as soon as I was able to find a better paying job.", "Yeah last part he had a court date", "So common here in Belgium I didn't even know that tradition wasn't more widespread. Kids love it. On the 1st April (and for days after that) you'll find paper fish in every corner of our house.", "My sister has a friend from Germany that came to visit and they encountered skunk smell on the highway (just the aftermath and speed). It's not as horrible in that context, and not overpowering since you're just getting whiffs. He thought someone had passed gas in the car, so he rolled down the window, which made it suddenly 100x worse! He was shocked and completely confused. So now he has a healthy fear of skunks, lol.", "This is the type of prank/surprise I love. I\u2019m an artist as a hobby, and I really enjoy surprising people with free art. I\u2019m no professional artist (my stuff is decent at best lol) but it\u2019s so fun giving things to people out of nowhere. They\u2019re shocked, and you get the satisfaction of making someone\u2019s day just a bit brighter. It\u2019s a win win!", "I get really emotional thinking about mine. He\u2019s already almost 9 and becoming so white around the muzzle.", "\"Skunk flavored tomato juice\" \ud83e\udd23 This was obviously not a fun time for your aunt, but hilarious for me.", "Ugh I feel you!  Mine is 13 and I\u2019m crossing fingers and toes for another 13 years", "It can last longer than that.  It's quite amazing", "If you both can\u2019t laugh at the prank then it\u2019s not a good prank", "We prank each other at my clinic....but a prank should leave both parties laughing, not one of them vomiting. This was not a prank it was hazing. Not cool.", "Pls tell me what you had written", ">No one ever has the balls to admit that.\n\nSome sadists actually do. \n\nBut the sadists I've met who self identified were also generally emotionally intelligent enough to understand that context and consent are key to something being considered fun instead of assault.", "    There once was a man from the city\n    Who met what he thought was a kitty.\n    He gave it a pat\n    and said \"nice little cat.\" \n    They buried his clothes out of pity.", "A skunk fell through a ground level basement window at my cousin's house into their basement. It was . . . not good.", "My dog loves it too. We bathed her at 11pm after one incident, and she ran right back over to the bush and rolled in the stink. Her reward was another bath.", "My friend's dog got skunked at 2 am in the middle of a Vermont winter so keeping the pup outside wasn't an option. All the stores were closed so they couldn't get tomato juice. They googled and found that Massengill as a shampoo on a skunked pet works. It did and she said her dog's fur was silky soft afterwards.", "Oh yes she was amazing. She left this world way too soon.", "YTA.\n\nYou should have been fired.\n\n\nI'm tired of people thinking that being horrible to pthers is a \"prank.\" Pranks are lighthearted tricks to people you KNOW who will also LAUGH along with you. NOT doing something gross or embarassing someone for your personal entertainment.\n\nYOU ARE A BULLY.\n\nBased on how casually you are treating this when EVERYONE you work with told you you were wrong and you still haven't apologized or admitted what you did was an awful thing I'm going to guess this is a pattern in your life of bullying others and you've gotten away with it until now. YOU ARE LUCKY that you didn't get fired. DO BETTER.", "YTA I\u2019m kinda sad you didn\u2019t get fired for your so called prank", "This had nothing to do with training nor that she will get stuff on her. I have worked in an emergency vet and regular ones and no one I know has ever had anal glands expressed in their face. You are trying to play it off as a joke but it wasn't. You were trying to teach her a lesson she didn't need from you. You are very aggressive. Are you mad that there's a new person? Do you care about your job at all? Why would you do this to someone on their 2nd day? You are a plain bully and this is NOT a method of training ANYONE uses. I agree with the vet that said it was an assault. YTA", "YUP.\n\nOP, If you were my employee I wouldn\u2019t give you 2 days unpaid leave. I\u2019d fire you full stop.\n\nThat\u2019s not a prank, it\u2019s hazing. The problem isn\u2019t that she \u201ctook it worse than I thought\u201d it\u2019s that your actions were indefensible. You also seem completely oblivious to the fact that you made a terrible choice and are unwilling to face any sort of consequences.\n\nJokes are only jokes if both people are laughing. Everything else is bullying and it\u2019s cruel.\n\nAlso, what a disgusting \u201cprank\u201d. I understand that getting gross stuff on you is part of being a vet, but making her get it on her face??? It\u2019s just mean.\n\nYTA.", "A helpful and kind coworker would warn them of the risk and how to minimize it.", "At least the urine sample is most likely sterile. This AH let an unsuspecting person get sprayed in the face (unprotected eyes, nose, mouth!) with biohazardous, germ ridden material.\n\nYTA, OP.", "Like rotting shit! It\u2019s disgusting!", "I'd describe the smell as \"room-clearing\" - I'm not a vet, but we had a dog that had issues.", "Welp as someone whose dog's anal glands constantly leak and has to have the expressed regularly..... \n\nI can tell you right now as I'm reading this and they juuuuuust started leaking again..... it's the worst.... it's like the strongest smelling fish smell ever, or if you have a women's sports team who have been practicing daily, hasn't showered that whole time, all stuck on a plane together, spreading their legs the whole time....", "> Just like these people who call themselves \"brutally honest\" or \"a bit of a jokester\", when they come to AITA, they are almost certainly assholes, and not even remotely funny or uplifting.\n\nPreach.", "In the electronics lab where I interned it was a bottle of liquid crystal.", "They could run my local blockbuster, I'd trust them for that", "I've used a mixture of blue dawn dish soap, baking soda, and hydrogen peroxide on my dog when he got sprayed. One application worked great. We just thuroughly rinsed him a couple times and then used his regular shampoo.", "This is great for thick coats, cheapest solution too. My mom worked in animal control and found it was easiest. BUT a secret (slightly more expensive) option is Arm & Hammer whitening toothpaste. We use it on our dogs faces since it's a little thicker and easier to keep out of their eyes. Real handy cuz our one pup is super friendly and goes to say hi with a butt sniff every time he meets a skunk (3 or 5 times now).\nFor either of the above, rinse the dog, work the anti-skunk solution into their fur, let it sit for 5m or so (peanut butter smeared on the bathtub wall is a great distraction for dogs who just wants OUT), and then rinse out the solution. Should do the trick. We usually only find it lingers down in their ears a bit since we can't get the interior so well.", "Good thing too. Can you imagine what a skunk would evolve into, having to deal with all the crazy animals over there?"]}
