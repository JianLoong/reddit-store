I mention it here, not on account of its excellence, but to make of it a symbol of sin. I have seen three or four of them. It has black fur, quite beautiful and shining; and has upon its back two perfectly white stripes, which join near the neck and tail, making an oval that adds greatly to their grace. The tail is bushy and well furnished with hair, like the tail of a Fox; it carries it curled back like that of a Squirrel. It is more white than black; and, at the first glance, you would say, especially when it walks, that it ought to be called Jupiter's little dog. But it is so stinking and casts so foul an odor, that it is unworthy of being called the dog of Pluto. No sewer ever smelled so bad. I would not have believed it if I had not smelled it myself. Your heart almost fails you when you approach the animal; two have been killed in our court, and several days afterward there was such a dreadful odor throughout our house that we could not endure it. I believe the sin smelled by Saint Catherine de Sienne must have had the same vile odor.\"", "Have you ever smelled a polecat?

I could even smell it on my clothes!", "I've never been sparyed but in the Midwest, when you're driving on the highway, if you pass a skunk that's been run over you can tell, because even driving past it at 60 mph  the smell will sneak into your car for 30 seconds or so, stinky Marijuana is an accurate description", "Hahahaha, it\u2019s bad. Real bad. When skunks die, they release that same smelly smell that use for defense. It\u2019s like\u2026 the smells of marijuana and a newspaper factory mixed together. Horrible. And it smells up the area for like a full fucking mile. Let\u2019s say that the skunk got hit by a car, and then you drive over the skunk somewhat soon after it died \u2014 your entire car will reek for days. The smell sticks. \n\nMy dad mistook a skunk for his cat (who was named Skunky, because she looked like a skunk) once and tried to pet it before realizing it was not the cat. Nearly got sprayed, but managed to avoid getting it on him. He still smelled. It\u2019s like, vomit inducing.", "As I said, I\u2019ve dealt with some pretty disgusting things in regards to animals.  I have a really strong stomach.  Nothing makes me gag.  Infection, maggots, surgery/blood, I\u2019m okay.  This past fall a skunk got hit in the road outside my house during the night.
