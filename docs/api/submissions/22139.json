Me and my brother aren't on good terms - and he's part of a reason why I moved out - I wanted to have some space and privacy as we've been living in one room.\n\nMy brother is a menace. He's staying in his room 24/7, usually playing games during night and sleeping during day. He doesn't attend school and I'm pretty sure he's going to fail school(as he's failing this year). During the time I was living there he didn't respect my mom or me, being obnoxious and vulgar. I've tried to help but he ignored me, it seems to be the case with my mom as well. Our father is an alcoholic who we tried to get rid of so many times and they seem to have some contact (mostly because of my mom), and I believe my mom asked him to help with my brother's attitude. Part of a reason why I wanted to live somewhere else was also because that place reminded me of my father.\n\nFast forward to now - my mom was acting weird for some time, like she felt that I hate them and that's because I \"left them\". She tried to get me to go back few times. I'm mostly hesitant on visiting them because of that - as I don't need more stress in my life. Of course I don't hate them, but it's becoming more obnoxious. What's more is that whenever the topic of my brother comes up(like when he failed his school or something along these lines) she always asks me to talk with him as she has \"no influence on him\". I said multiple times that he literally doesn't listen to me and honestly I don't really feel any connection to him. She however blames me because \"he's my brother\" and that I'm obligated to take care of him. And I just got tired to repeat it so many times. It's her problem because they enabled him and I'm not supposed to fix their own mistakes - as I already had to go to therapy because of them(mostly my father).\n\nSo am I the asshole for not helping my mom with my brother?", "created_utc": 1689258170, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ym8hf/aita_for_not_helping_my_mom_with_my_brother15m/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It looks like your mother has just given up trying to straighten out your brother and wants to hand him off to you to ease her conscious.  Your post mentioned enabling.

Less stress for you, and let them concentrate more on parenting and less on trying to get someone else to do their work.", "NTA you are a sibling, not a parent.

This is a problem that is far beyond your paygrade.  Your brother needs therapy, and it doesn't sound like your mom is providing this.
